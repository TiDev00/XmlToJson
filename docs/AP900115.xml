   A telephone company circuit failure halted
delivery of markets data Monday from the New York and American
stock exchanges to The Associated Press.
   As a result, some of the stock tables compiled and transmitted
by the AP were delayed and others did not reflect final closing
prices for some stocks.
   The AP has two sets of phone circuits from the exchanges, and
both the prime and backup circuits failed in the outage, said John
Reid, AP director of communications and technology.
   ``In each of the two sets there are two wires, which means the
information from the exchanges actually is delivered four different
ways. All four of the wires failed,'' he said.
   The outage occurred when cables were damaged by flooding in a
major New York Telephone circuit building in the city's financial
district. The trouble was not related to widespread long-distance
calling problems experienced Monday by American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., Reid said.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Monday he has
no plans to allow American servicewomen in combat despite
complaints from some female soldiers and a call to do so from a
congresswoman.
   ``My own personal view is that the current system is about
right,'' Cheney said at a news conference. ``We've worked to expand
opportunity for women as much as possible. It's a continuing
process of opening up various occupational specialties where we
think it's appropriate.''
   Sgt. Rhonda Maskus of the Army 82nd Airborne Division based at
Fort Bragg, N.C., has filed a discrimination complaint against the
Army, alleging a male soldier was selected over her for the recent
Panama mission despite her expertise as an intelligence analyst on
Panama.
   Army policy bars women from combat roles although several women
were engaged in combat in Panama.
   In addition, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., has said she will
introduce a bill that would allow female military personnel into
combat.
   But Cheney drew the line Monday, saying, ``I think there are
situations in the nature of modern warfare that women assigned to
various combat support units or to M.P. (military police) units,
for example, as was the case in Panama, will in fact end up in
combat and have to defend themselves accordingly.
   ``That's a different proposition from taking a unit that has a
specific combat role and saying we ought to change the makeup of
that unit and include women to fill those roles. As a general
proposition, I think the current exclusion from certain types of
unit is appropriate.''

   Presumed leftist guerrillas tossed a bomb at a
residence housing U.S. Marines Monday night, injuring a passer-by
and causing minor damage, police and U.S. sources said.
   The explosion at the Marine house in suburban Miraflores
occurred at 9:15 p.m., according to witnesses, who told reporters
three men threw the bomb and then fled in a car.
   An American official said the explosion damaged windows and a
door of the residence housing U.S. Marines who serve as guards at
the U.S. Embassy in downtown Lima. No Marines were injured, he said.
   A police source said a pedestrian who was injured in the blast
was carried to a nearby hospital. The source said the bombing
appeared to be the work of anti-government leftist rebels but said
it was uncertain whether the Shining Path or Tupac Amaru group was
responsible.

   A Greyhound bus en route from Los Angeles to
Las Vegas skidded into a barrier on rain-slick Interstate 15 early
Sunday and flipped onto its side, injuring 31 people, most of them
slightly, officials said.
   The bus carrying 33 people and the driver was about three blocks
from the Las Vegas Strip when the accident occurred around 6 a.m.
during a heavy rain, said Highway Patrol Sgt. Bill Marquardt.
   ``The driver was heading north and started to change lanes, and
apparently just lost it,'' Marquardt said.
   Most of the injuries did not appear to be serious, he said.
   The injured were taken to four Las Vegas hospitals, where all
but one were treated and released, nursing supervisors said. A Los
Angeles man was listed in stable condition at University Medical
Center with fractured ribs.
   Manuel A. Bispo, a Marine stationed at Camp Pendleton, Calif.,
said ``people started to panic'' when the bus skidded into the
concrete barrier in the median of the six-lane highway, then
flipped.
   ``I yelled `Don't panic,''' Bispo said. ``People were shoving to
get out. They were afraid the gas tank was going to blow up.
   ``After I yelled and another guy yelled the same, people calmed
down and exited orderly,'' said Bispo.
   Bispo and his wife, Marie, said the bus ran onto the shoulder of
the interstate twice previously on the 280-mile trip that began at
midnight.
   Charlie Tibbs, a Greyhound spokesman in Las Vegas, declined to
identify the driver. He said the accident was probably the result
of slick roads.
   There was nothing to indicate excessive speed was involved in
the accident, Sgt. Bill Marquardt of the Nevada Highway Patrol
said. ``The roadway was wet and slick,'' he said. ``The bus just
appeared to go out of control.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: 11 Members of Congress Face Ethics Inquiries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Congress reconvenes later this month it
must deal with the ethics problems of 11 members, including five
senators who intervened with banking regulators and three House
members accused of improper sexual behavior.
   The list includes the No. 2-ranking Senate Democrat, the
second-ranking House Republican, the chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, a onetime prisoner of war in Vietnam and America's
best-known former astronaut.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is looking into the conduct of seven
senators, including the ``Keating five'' accused of improperly
intervening with federal banking regulators on behalf of the owner
of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   However, none of the four House cases is expected to equal the
political drama of the investigation that led to Speaker Jim
Wright's resignation last year.
   ``Most people like their congressman but have a negative opinion
of the elective body'' as a whole, said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
   He said that explains why incumbents generally win re-election
despite investigations like the Lincoln case, which he said
``stereotypes'' members of Congress as ``arrogant, selfish tools of
special interests.''
   None of the senators under investigation is up for re-election
this year, while House members face the voters every two years.
   The ``Keating five'' senators are Republican John McCain of
Arizona, a former POW in Vietnam; Majority Whip Alan Cranston of
California; Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. of
Michigan; Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and former astronaut John
Glenn of Ohio.
   They intervened with banking regulators on behalf of Charles H.
Keating Jr., when he sought relief from an intense government
examination of the California-based thrift.
   Keating, his relatives and employees contributed $1.3 million to
the five senators' campaigns and political causes.
   Others who face scrutiny are Sens. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y.
and David Durenberger, R-Minn.; House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich
of Georgia; Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill.; Rep. Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens,
R-Ohio and Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
   The House and Senate ethics committees have launched formal
investigations in all except Gingrich's case. The House panel must
decide whether to pursue that inquiry despite an outside counsel's
recommendation to drop the case.
   In Durenberger's case, the committee is investigating whether he
sought to evade limits on speaking fees he earned on a book
promotion tour, and whether he improperly profited by charging the
Senate for rent on a Minneapolis condominium he co-owned.
   A complaint by a political opponent of D'Amato said the senator
steered federal housing projects to his political supporters and
improperly peddled his influence in other matters.
   In the House, Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., has complained that
Gingrich violated House rules and federal campaign finance laws by
getting 21 investors to put up $5,000 each to promote a book he
co-authored. Alexander also complained of alleged violations in a
number of other areas.
   The committee also is investigating:
   _Frank, an admitted homosexual, who has acknowledged paying male
prostitute Stephen Gobie $80 for sex in 1985 and subsequently
hiring him with personal funds to serve as a housekeeper and driver
from July 1985 through August 1987.
   Frank has denied Gobie's allegations that the lawmaker was aware
that Gobie ran a prostitution ring from the congressman's
apartment, and that Gobie and Frank engaged in sexual activity at
the House gym.
   _Savage, who is fighting allegations that he sexually assaulted
a Peace Corps volunteer while on an official trip to Zaire last
March. Savage has said, ``They tried to destroy Dr. Martin Luther
King with a lie. ... I'm in very good company.''
   _Lukens, R-Ohio, convicted in May of contributing to the
unruliness of a minor for having sex with a 16-year-old girl. He
was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine, but is appealing
while remaining free on bond.
   Some of the lawmakers under investigation have resorted to
extraordinary measures to proclaim their innocence, including
television commercials, newspaper advertisements, hiring
experienced defense lawyers and building up defense war chests.
Durenberger made an unusual apology ``to the people of Minnesota.''

<HEAD>US Business Executives, Travelers Flocking to Eastern Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawyers, travel agents, business executives
and public relations men are flocking to Eastern Europe as if it
were the promised land, hoping to make connections that will pay
off in the future.
   While optimistic entrepreneurs see potential pots of gold at the
end of Eastern European rainbows, few people today say they are
making money in nations turning from communism to capitalism.
   But many say they need to enter the markets at the ground floor,
cultivating contacts and learning language and cultural skills
unique to the potentially lucrative markets.
   Despite difficulties _ bureaucrats in Poland are so overwhelmed
they sometimes schedule 10 p.m. business meetings, and telephone
communications into Romania are spotty _ executives say it's a good
time to lay a foundation for doing business.
   ``Poland is where Germany was after World War II,'' said John
Adams, a public relations executive who chairs The Worldcom Group,
a consortium of public relations companies that has opened an
office in Warsaw.
   Adams predicted a booming market in five years, adding,
``Companies are not looking for a quick buck.''
   ``There is no money right now,'' echoed David Handler, a program
director at the Boston-based Sabre Foundation, a nonprofit
educational and scientific organization that promotes free
enterprise.
   In fact, the Commerce Department has been ``very candid'' about
warning Americans they're unlikely to stumble on any get-rich-quick
schemes in Eastern Europe, said Susanne Lotarski, director of the
department's office of East European and Soviet affairs.
   ``Most of the economies in the region have various degrees of
economic problems,'' she said.
   Nonetheless, Lotarski said her office is fielding 10 times as
many inquiries as last year from American companies and
corporations.
   Firms dealing in agriculture, health care, telecommunications,
pollution control, energy savings, tourism and housing problably
will have the best chance of penetrating the Eastern European
markets, she said.
   ``The price of entry for anyone into Eastern Europe is quite
low,'' said Handler of the Sabre Foundation. His group is
encouraging companies to donate equipment and products to Poland as
a means to gain identification, he said.
   Pfizer Inc., the medical company, donated $100,000 in
pharmaceuticals for animals in Poland, he said.
   A number of Americans are so keen to enter Eastern Europe that
they are working for free.
   Jeffrey Burt, a partner at the law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter, said
the firm provided the Polish government with two free lawyers to
pursue privatization efforts.
   Others are hoping the contacts they made before the Iron Curtain
fell will blossom.
   Frank Mankiewicz of Hill &amp; Knowlton said he was recently in
Budapest, Hungary, where the public relations company has a client,
the Central Bank of Hungary. Hill &amp; Knowlton is courting other
clients there, he said.
   Edward J. von Kloberg, whose von Kloberg &amp; Associates worked for
the government of deposed Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu, said
he still represents Romania even though the hated president was
overthrown and executed.
   Von Kloberg sometimes arranged for the placement of
pro-Ceausescu articles in newspapers like the Journal of Commerce,
according to records on file at the Justice Department's office of
foreign agent registration. He received $15,000 from Romania in
January 1988.
   Business people aren't the only Americans with a thirst for
Eastern Europe.
   Travel agents are flooded with requests from travelers seeking
new adventures in countries that are still relatively inexpensive,
said Francis Goranin of Vega International Travel Services in
Chicago.
   Goranin, who has long specialized in travel behind the Iron
Curtain, said it can be difficult for Americans traveling on their
own to find good accommodations.
   ``The good hotels in Hungary are full most of the time, and
Czechoslovakia is a similar story,'' he said. The Marriott Corp.
recently opened a hotel in Poland, and Bulgaria is anxious to
develop its Black Sea resorts.

   A woman is suing the city for allegedly
violating the air space above her property by building a
five-story-high pedestrian bridge.
   ``In the olden days, your property ran to the center of the
Earth up to the heavens,'' said Michael Martinis, attorney for Ann
B. White. ``Now it is interpreted to be the usable air space above
your property.''
   The lawsuit filed Friday in Marion County Circuit Court demands
that the city recognize her right to use and enjoy the space above
her land. It seeks no monetary compensation except attorney fees.
   ``We want a judge to sort out everybody's rights,'' Martinis
said.
   If the defendants recognize White's right, the lawsuit would be
dropped, he said.
   The walkway connects a garage to Capitol Center, an office
building owned by Salem Historical Associates, a limited
partnership based in California. The bridge passes high above a
parking area behind the Tahiti Restaurant and Lounge, which White
owns and leases.
   David DeMartino, deputy city attorney, said he had not seen the
complaint and could not comment. He could not recall the city
previously being sued for violation of air space.

<TEXT>
   Bombings in the South and random acts of violence and vandalism
across the country have given rise to fears that a new wave of
racially and ethnically motivated crime is sweeping the United
States.
   Nearly every day brings a fresh report from somewhere: from
Portland, Ore., where skinheads were charged with beating a
15-year-old Hispanic girl; from Wellesley, Mass., where two young
men were arrested for spray-painting swastikas and racist slogans
on walls; from New York City, where a gang of white youths was
charged with killing a black man who crossed into their turf.
   New organizations have sprung up to fight racism, and police,
judges and legislators are taking a harder look at what they can do
to prevent such crime.
   But among those who closely monitor what are commonly called
``hate crimes,'' there is disagreement about whether racism is
really resurgent. Some argue that only the reporting of racial
crime has increased, not the crime itself.
   ``The paradox is that the better you are at reporting, the worse
your picture is going to look,'' said Col. Leonard Supenski, who
heads the police crime prevention bureau in Baltimore County, Md.
   Supenski speaks from experience. His police department, whose
beat ranges over 610 square miles from the industrial edge of
Baltimore to horse country near the Pennsylvania border, was one of
the first in the nation to begin reporting hate crimes in a
category of their own.
   Baltimore County has kept statistics on RREs _ Racial, Religious
and Ethnic incidents _ since 1979, and its figures show a slight
increase last year after four years of decline.
   The increase could be the result of a more sensitive police
force, quicker to recognize a racist motive behind a crime. It
could be the result of a more trusting public, more likely to
report a crime. Or it could just be part of what Supenski calls the
``ebb and flow'' of crime.
   Only a handful of cities around the nation have kept track of
hate crimes for very long; one is New York City, where ``bias
crimes'' were down slightly during the first 10 months of 1989.
They had been down sharply until Aug. 23, when a gang of whites
surrounded a 16-year-old black youth, Yusuf Hawkins, and shot him
to death on a Brooklyn street. Ripples of lesser racial incidents _
tauntings, beatings _ spread across the city.
   Inspector Paul M. Sanderson, who heads the New York Police
Department's Bias Crime Unit, isn't persuaded that racist crime is
really changing.
   ``There is no pattern,'' he said.
   Sanderson, 54, is black and recalls hate crime in his youth,
although it wasn't called that.
   ``I grew up here and I know what went on in this city,'' he
said. ``And I know that if you went up to a cop and said, ... `I
was hit in the head with a baseball bat, and I got the injury
because I'm black and I was in a white neighborhood,' (he'd say),
`Get out of here, kid, go on home.'''
   Still, for every Paul Sanderson or Leonard Supenski, there are
others who say racist crime is getting worse. They see neo-Nazi
skinheads pumping new life into the Ku Klux Klan, they hear about
racism sprouting on college campuses, and they can tick off lists
of violent incidents around the country that have nothing in common
but their motive _ prejudice.
   One such person is Bill Tafoya, who teaches long-range planning
at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., and moonlights at the
Congressional Clearinghouse on the Future _ a sort of institutional
crystal ball. His specialty is civil disorder.
   Tafoya has a simple test for gauging the ups and downs of
racism. Every year, he searches a computer database for references
to four words or phrases _ ``racism or racist,'' ``bigotry,''
``white supremacy'' and ``hate groups.''
   In 1980, those words appeared 767 times in The New York Times
and The Washington Post. In 1988, the last full year for which
Tafoya has records, they appeared 2,122 times _ about a threefold
increase.
   Tafoya concedes that those figures alone don't mean there has
been an increase in racism _ it could just be increased interest in
the subject. But he believes the increase is real and says other
researchers agree.
   Besides, police have become interested in hate crime _ Tafoya
knows because he's constantly asked to lecture to them.
   ``My warning to them is that if they turn away from the issue
... then they're going to be in a very uncomfortable position of
being in the middle when the lid blows off,'' he said.
   The message is not being ignored. More police departments around
the nation are beginning to follow the lead of Baltimore County,
New York City and Boston _ pioneers in establishing special
programs to fight hate crime.
   Minneapolis started a bias crime program in 1987; Philadelphia,
San Francisco and Portland, Ore., are among other cities that now
pay special attention to hate crime.
   Most such programs have two basic goals: to keep separate
reports on hate crimes so that investigators can spot patterns, and
to assure the public that such crimes will not be tolerated.
   ``If the people don't have a sense that they can go the police,
and go to the courts, they're going to go to the streets,''
explained Sgt. Bill Johnston, who directs the Boston Police
Department's Community Disorders Unit.
   Reporting is considered especially important. There are no
national statistics on hate crime now, which is one reason that
people disagree about it. A bill pending in Congress would require
the Justice Department to collect such data.
   Those who follow the issue closely, such as Adele Dutton Terrell
of the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence, say
passage of the Hate Crime Statistics Act is essential.
   ``People pay attention to hate group activity _ skinheads, the
KKK,'' Ms. Terrell said. ``But when you read about crosses being
burned into the lawn of a family that just moved in, or Asians or
Hispanics being harrassed, people assume these are isolated cases.
We need the data to show that's not the case.''
   In the meantime, at least 10 states have passed laws in the past
few years requiring their police departments to collect data on
hate crimes. And lawmakers are finding other ways to battle racist
crime.
   According to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, at
least 31 states have passed laws making ``ethnic intimidation'' or
harrassment a crime; at least 34 states have made ``institutional
vandalism'' a crime.
   Courts are also looking for innovative ways to combat racism. In
Eugene, Ore., last year, a man convicted of racial intimidation was
ordered to attend a racial awareness course in addition to serving
60 days in jail.
   And last July in Montgomery, Ala., seven Ku Klux Klan members
agreed to attend a similar course as part of an out-of-court
settlement of a civil lawsuit filed by the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference.
   No one believes these measures are going to end racial hatred or
stop racial violence. That will require more basic social change.
Some hold the economic system responsible; others say the failure
has been in the schools; still others say any change must take
place in homes, in churches, or in people's hearts.
   ``We're doing badly in shaping people and preparing them to go
out and get along in life, and to exist and interact with other
people in a civilized fashion,'' said Sanderson of the NYPD.
``We're all responsible.''

   Nature's way of recycling water gets some
wet and wild twists in machines Bill Williamson builds to clean up
hazardous wastes for industries ranging from nuclear power to
perfume.
   ``There's a whole new science that we've got to learn,'' said
Williamson, 74, who's been experimenting with evaporation and
condensation since World War II, when he developed machines that
distilled sea water aboard warships.
   Williamson, a mechanical engineer, turned his attention to
fighting pollution 14 years ago when he and his sons, Bruce and
Rod, founded the small but fast-growing Licon Inc. in Pensacola.
   ``We are doing some weird things. Some smart physical chemists,
when they see what we are doing, they just throw up their hands,''
he said.
   Licon produces evaporators that clean up wastewater and let
industries concentrate and reuse toxic metals and chemicals that
once went down the drain into the environment. Some plants that use
the machines don't even have sewers.
   The evaporators, with a patented heat exchanger, operate at
relatively low temperatures, high efficiency and low cost, said Rod
Williamson. They can treat wastewater for 1 or 2 cents a gallon
compared to as much as 12 cents for other machines and up to $2 for
disposal in a hazardous waste dump, he said.
   One is being tested at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant;
NuPac Services plans to use it to decontaminate 2.3 million gallons
of water irradiated in the 1979 accident that shut down the
Harrisburg, Pa., plant.
   Licon evaporators, which cost $14,000 to $250,000, are in use in
the United States, Canada and Europe. Most are in metal plating
plants, although one is cleaning up shampoo wastes at an Alberto
Culver plant in Puerto Rico.
   Customers can be found in nearly any industry that produces
liquid hazardous waste, but there are limits, Rod Williamson said.
Some industries, including paper mills and chemical factories,
produce too much wastewater to be efficiently treated with
evaporators now being produced, he said.
   Bill Williamson, who holds 30 patents, said the key to the
machines is low air pressure. When boiled, even freshwater leaves a
scale, although the residue is much worse with saltwater or
wastewater and would quickly foul and corrode a conventional
evaporator. He said he discovered that heating water in a whole or
partial vacuum, thereby lowering its boiling point, would reduce
the scale and permit recovering specific salts for reuse. The
machines also reuse heat the way a heat pump improves a home
heating and air conditioning system.
   Williamson began working on desalinization while employed by
Maxim Silencer Corp., which specialized in equipment to muffle
diesel engines. It was asked to develop a way to purify saltwater
aboard Coast Guard cutters so that they could escort convoys in
World War II. The cutters were too small to carry enough fuel and
water to cross the ocean, but could make the trip if water storage
areas were used instead for fuel oil, he said.
   The company rented a beachfront house at Clinton, Conn., to test
the machine. Its resemblance to a moonshiner's still prompted
neighbors to call the police. At first, officers who raided the
place didn't believe the machine was producing nothing stronger
than water but, ``They looked at it and tasted it and said `OK,'''
Williamson said.
   He later worked on similar equipment for nuclear submarines and
in 1970 helped set up a desalting test station near the Panhandle
resort town of Destin for Mechanical Equipment Co. of New Orleans.
   Williamson and his sons then formed Licon, short for ``liquid
conditioning'' or ``liquid concentration,'' and built its first
evaporator in his garage out of pipe fittings and other parts they
bought or made.

   Wang has a wife and baby, a secure government job
and no particular interest in politics. Until recently, he never
thought about leaving China.
   But since June he has become obsessed with the idea, to the
point that he says he can hardly concentrate on his work. He and a
friend spend hours debating the best way leave. They think it's
best to leave as a student and that the best place to go is
Australia.
   If he succeeds, he will leave behind his wife and child,
probably never to return. ``She understands,'' Wang said. ``She
knows I can't live here.''
   Uncalculated thousands of China's best-educated people, many of
them young, have reached the same conclusion since June, when the
Chinese army opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing.
   Their idealistic dreams of saving China shattered, many students
now say they are only interested in saving themselves from
political repression, cultural tedium and economic hardships of
socialist China.
   Study abroad was popular before June. What has changed is that
now virtually everyone with a college degree and many without one
are talking about it, even those with little or no foreign language
skills.
   Schemes for getting overseas are getting wilder, too. An artist
talked dreamily one week of seeking an invitation to exhibit his
work abroad. The next week, realistically dropping that idea, he
proposed finding a foreign woman to marry.
   ``I can't paint in this environment,'' he said.
   The U.S. Embassy said the number of applications for Chinese
government-sponsored study abroad has dropped.
   But the number of non-government students jumped by one-third
compared to the previous year, with 2,424 receiving visas in the
fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. The number of Chinese going to
visit relatives already studying in the United States more than
tripled, to 321 in the last three months of 1989.
   Student applications to go to Canada, another popular
destination, topped 3,000 from June through December, up more than
50 percent from the same period in 1988, the Canadian Embassy said.
   Many of those now trying to leave say they are not interested in
politics, and many did not take part actively in the massive
pro-democracy protests that preceded June's crackdown. But they
sympathized with the protesters' demands for a freer society and
regard the deluge of political rhetoric since June as the last
straw.
   ``Most people are sick of the system,'' said a young college
graduate who is applying to study in the United States. ``They
don't want to get involved in politics, but since June everyone has
to read papers and make a statement about what he did during the
protests. People don't want to do that.''
   She acknowledged that many people seek riches abroad, but she
said money is only one factor in a quality-of-life equation that
includes less bureaucracy, more personal freedom and professional
fulfillment.
   ``They may have had good ideas but found out that they can't
carry them out here,'' she said. ``They have no hope. Many people
think that even if the government is overthrown it won't
necessarily be better.''
   Suggestions that China cannot reform or advance if its brightest
youth go abroad rouse little interest. One repeat applicant at the
U.S. Embassy, one of few Chinese in his field, shrugged and said,
``We can't do anything here now.''
   The embassy tries to screen out anyone they suspect will not
return to China.
   So eager are many to leave that they were angered when
Washington said Chinese students already in the United States could
stay beyond their visas: they feared China would retaliate by
closing the door on study abroad.
   The opening in the door already has narrowed, and further
narrowing is expected. The government is expected to issue
regulations this month requiring applicants for study abroad to
first work at least five years in China.
   Since June, many work units have begun requiring employees who
go abroad to pay a personal bond, in some cases as large as 12,000
yuan, or about $2,550, to be refunded when they come back.
   Applicants for the Test of English as a Foreign Language,
required for entry to most U.S. colleges, now must obtain
permission letters from their work unit or college department, and
students at Beijing University say they have been refused the
letters.
   Beijing University also has refused to give students course
transcripts for foreign college applications unless the government
is sponsoring their study abroad. Police reportedly are approving
fewer passports, although no figures are available.
   All this has made the would-be emigres more anxious than ever.
   A teen-age girl called up a Canadian woman sobbing and
threatening to commit suicide if the woman did not help her get a
visa to study in Canada. The next day, the girl's mother showed up
on the woman's doorstep with a gift of expensive embroidery.
   ``I sent it back in the mail,'' the Canadian said. ``I don't
know if she got her visa.''

   He's become the symbol of racism in the tangled,
shocking Charles Stuart crime drama, but even the attorney for the
man originally suspected of shooting Stuart and his pregnant wife
said William Bennett is no saint.
   ``Let's just say he's not the brightest bulb in the Christmas
tree,'' said Robert George, Bennett's criminal defense lawyer.
``And he's no altar boy.''
   By almost all accounts, Willie Bennett is a tough ex-con whose
criminal record dates back to 1964, including serving time for
shooting a police officer.
   Bennett is currently being held on $35,000 bail since his arrest
on a motor vehicle violation Nov. 1.
   Charles Stuart's suicide, after he found out he had become the
police's prime suspect in his wife's killing, cleared Bennett in
the case. Bennett had never been charged with the crime, but he had
been named frequently in police leaks to reporters. Stuart also had
picked him out of a police lineup.
   ``He's done his time, he showed he was a man,'' said Veda
Bennett, 29, who was home with her mother the night Boston police
kicked in the door of their apartment and ransacked it.
   John Julian, a spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney
Newman Flanagan, said all search warrants and affidavits in the
Bennett investigation were ``aboveboard.''
   Bennett, 39, was born and raised in Boston's Mission Hill, the
inner-city neighborhood that gained national notoriety after Stuart
told police a black mugger robbed and shot him and his wife after
they left a birthing class Oct. 23.
   ``Bennett was the symbol of the mentality of `get a black, any
black,''' said Paul Parks, a veteran Boston civil rights activist.
   Police have said they considered Bennett a serious suspect not
only because of his lengthy criminal record but because he was
fingered by members of his own community.
   A key witness, Dereck Jackson, 17, said in a police affidavit
that Bennett admitted to the shooting and claimed he told the
couple not to look in the rear view mirror _ the same account
Stuart gave police. But on Friday, Jackson said police pressured
him to make false statements.
   Bennett is the oldest of seven siblings born to Pauline and
William Bennett. He has two infant daughters by two current
girlfriends, one of whom is expecting another child. He has a
teen-age daughter by an ex-wife. His favorite foods are steak,
pig's feet, black-eyed peas and his mother's home-fried potatoes,
said his mother says.
   When Bennett is not in jail, he ``lives off his women,'' his
attorney said. When he gets out of jail he is likely to return to
the pregnant girlfriend's run-down Roxbury apartment building where
his name is on the mailbox.
   George said Bennett has refused to talk publicly about the
Stuart case. ``He's a tough con. To him, the whole world is a
stranger.''
   Bennett's mother, Pauline, who has been separated from her
husband for years, lives in a four-bedroom apartment in a public
housing project with daughters Veda and Tarita and their four
children. Another daughter also lives in the project.
   Bennett's father, William Sr., lives nearby but has what one
daughter called ``memory problems.'' The family is not often in
touch with him and he knows little about his son's case, she said.
   White-haired and tentative, Mrs. Bennett sat at her kitchen
table during a recent interview, surrounded by children and
grandchildren. She is protective of her son and angry about the
accusations that splashed her family across the nation's front
pages.
   ``I'm angry for what happened but I'm glad my son is out of
it,'' she said. ``I knew all along he wouldn't do nothing like
this.''
   The night Boston police raided their home for evidence was a
nightmare, said Veda Bennett.
   ``They broke down the door and they had shields and guns in our
faces. It was crazy. They were here for three hours. We couldn't
even go to the bathroom.''
   The family doesn't like to talk about William Bennett's criminal
past, which his lawyer confirmed included 38 arraignments and 60
arrests. Bennett was first arrested when he was 14 on a charge of
taking money out of parking meters.
   He has spent much of his adult life in prison. In 1973, he was
convicted of shooting a police officer, among other charges, and
spent five years at the state prison in Walpole. He returned to
prison in 1981 after being convicted on assault and armed robbery
charges.
   The Boston Globe reported Friday that Bennett once shot a cab
driver who was a double amputee because the man had only $42 on
him. Bennett's attorney was unable to confirm the account to the AP
and police would not comment.
   Pauline Bennett shakes her head and looks away when asked about
her son's past.
   ``All I know is, whenever I needed him, he was there,'' she
said. ``He used to make me go to the hospital when I had chest
pains.''

   Cats are cuddly ``houseplants'' for the 1990s,
according to a feline expert.
   ``It's the urbanization of America. People live in cities, their
time is allocated, people are working. A cat is so much easier to
take care of. A cat can be left alone,'' said Mordecai Siegal, a
member of the Feline Advisory Council at Cornell University's
Feline Health Center and editor of the center's newly published
guide to cat care.
   ``You need a touch of nature in your life. I call them
four-legged houseplants,'' said Siegal, who is on a promotion tour
for ``The Cornell Book of Cats: A Comprehensive Medical Reference
for Every Cat and Kitten.''
   The $24.95 book tackles what Siegal said are the two most common
cat-owner complaints _ pets that shred furniture and ignore their
litter boxes.
   ``They can systematically destroy everything you own,'' said the
editor, who lives in New York City with his wife, three children,
dog, and, of course, a cat.
   Cats became more popular pets than dogs in 1985. Last year,
Americans owned 57.9 million cats vs. 50.5 million dogs, according
to estimates from The Pet Food Institute, a Washington-based trade
association.

   Firing up the charcoal and throwing a piece of
meat on top has prehistoric roots, according to a museum curator.
   Charles Finsley, earth sciences curator of The Dallas Museum of
Natural History, said evidence exists that shows those who lived in
Texas 10,000 to 15,000 years ago barbecued a variety of animals.
   He is fairly certain that was the fate of a huge mammoth whose
fossilized bones went on display for the first time Sunday.
   ``There is a suspicious number of charred areas, places
apparently blackened by fire and pieces of charcoal were found
under the bones,'' Finsley said.
   The mammoth remains were discovered in November by Barry Leon,
an amateur paleontologist. Finsley said more excavations are
planned at the site along the Sulphur River in northeast Texas.
   The animal, a large elephant-like creature that would have stood
14{ feet tall and weighed about 14 tons, is believed to be about
12,000 years old.
   ``I think it would have taken about a 55-gallon drum of barbecue
sauce,'' said Finsley.
   While it becomes clear that prehistoric Texans were fond of
barbecue, Finsley says he couldn't in good conscience say that it
was a Texas invention.
   ``You never know,'' he said. ``Maybe those early people wandered
down from Kansas City.''

   A package of ethics bills is on a fast
track in the State Senate as a verdict on federal corruption
charges looms against one legislator and the specter of more
indictments hovers.
   The ethics package already has reached the state Senate floor, a
little over a week after it was introduced by the upper house's
leaders, who complain that the trial of Sen. Joseph Montoya and a
continuing FBI probe has unfairly tarnished legislators'
reputations.
   ``We're on the fast track, as fast as we can get the votes,''
said Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti, a Democrat.
   ``These are not happy times for us,''added Senate Minority
Leader Ken Maddy, a Republican.
   The bills would bar legislators and other elected state
officials from accepting honorariums, limit the value of gifts they
can receive from most sources and impose tougher
conflict-of-interest restrictions.
   The three measures would put into effect portions of a state
constitutional amendment that lawmakers last year approved for the
June 1990 ballot.
   The amendment also would create a pay commission to set salary
levels for legislators and other top state officials, a provision
that critics say could result in unlimited raises and could cause
voters to sink the entire package.
   Currently, there is a 5 percent-per-year limit on legislators'
salary hikes. Legislators now receive $40,816 a year, although
their pay averages about $56,000 when their $88-per-day living
expense provision, state-leased car payments and unlimited gasoline
credit card are factored in.
   The Legislature's image has been taking a beating since FBI
agents raided the offices of four lawmakers late one night in
August 1988, revealing a corruption investigation that had been
going on for three years. No other lawmakers have been charged, but
there is speculation some of them might be.
   Montoya was indicted last May. He went on trial in early
December on 12 felony counts of bribery, extortion, racketeering
and money laundering. Montoya, a Democrat from the Los Angeles
suburb of El Monte who has been in the Legislature 17 years, faces
a maximum of 220 years in prison and more than $3 million in fines.
   To start off the new year, a Los Angeles Times poll reported
that 53 percent of 1,594 voters questioned felt that ``taking
bribes is relatively common practice'' among California legislators.
   In addition, seven out of 10 of those surveyed favored a limit
on lawmakers' terms, a concept that legislators fear may reach the
ballot this year through an initiative drive.
   ``Events have been such that we have the momentum to push this
through,'' Sen. John Doolittle, Republican caucus chairman, said of
the pending legislation.
   The Assembly hasn't been quite so quick to respond. A hearing on
ethics legislation was postponed last Wednesday, Assembly Speaker
Willie Brown said, because the bills weren't ready.
   ``We should not pass a bill only to deal with the image
problem,'' he said. ``You should not give Dracula the quart of
blood he needs for a quick fix.''
   Prosecutors claim that Montoya, the chairman of the Senate
Business and Professions Committee, put his vote and political
influence up for sale in an attempt to become wealthy.
   The centerpiece of their case is a videotape showing Montoya
accepting a $3,000 check from an undercover FBI agent. The agent
was posing as the head of a fictional shrimp-importing company that
wanted legislation passed to help it out.
   Prosecutors claim that the check was a payoff for Montoya's
efforts to move the bill through the Senate. Defense attorneys
contend the money was a legal honorarium, even though Montoya
received the check at a breakfast meeting with the agent and a
Senate aide and did not give a speech _ the usual reason for an
honorarium.
   There are also charges that Montoya pressured people for money
in return for his help with other legislation.
   Actor Ed Asner, formerly head of the Screen Actors Guild,
testified he once lobbied Montoya to get his support for SAG's
position on a pending bill. During their meeting, Asner said, he
got the impression Montoya would not support his position unless
SAG contributed to the senator's campaign.
   Defense attorneys have tried to punch holes in the prosecution's
case but have suffered a series of setbacks in rulings by Judge
Milton Schwartz.
   In one ruling, Schwartz refused to let the defense ask other
legislators' about their motives in voting for the shrimp bill.
Defense attorneys wanted to show that Montoya could have had
honorable reasons for helping the bill, but Schwartz said another
lawmaker's motives would not necessarily be the same as Montoya's.
   Defense attorneys expect to wrap up their case this week.
   Prosecutors have refused to say if they plan additional
indictments, but there have been indications that more legislators
might face charges.
   The strongest sign came in November when an Assembly aide
pleaded guilty to helping extort $12,500 for Republican lawmakers
and agreed to cooperate with the government in exchange for its
recommendation of a mimimum sentence.
   ``It's a cooperative agreement,'' U.S. Attorney David Levi said.
``You have to assume that we only enter into those agreements if we
believe cooperation will be of value to us.''

   Signs advertising Marlboro cigarettes and
Budweiser beer are appearing in children's video arcade games,
outraging doctors who are trying to reduce teen-age smoking.
   The manufacturer of the games, Sega of America, said the
inclusion of the logos was ``simply a game designer's innocent
attempt to mimic real-life locations.'' The statement was issued
Friday in response to an inquiry from The Associated Press.
   One game, Super Monaco GP, includes buildings in which all of
the windows have been replaced by the Marlboro logo. Other Sega
games using the logos are Hang On and Power Drift.
   Dave Rosen, co-chairman of Sega's board, said in the statement
that ``there is absolutely no form of paid or intentional
advertising displayed in any of Sega's arcade or consumer video
games.''
   The company said it was in the process of removing the logos. It
did not say how many games have been made or how long they have
been in use.
   Philip Morris, which makes Marlboro cigarettes, and Anheuser
Busch, the maker of Budweiser, said they had not authorized the use
of their brand names or logos. Philip Morris has asked Sega to
recall the games.
   Tobacco companies have been known to pay large sums for mention
of their products. Philip Morris, for example, paid $350,000 for
the placement of Lark cigarettes in the James Bond film ``Licence
to Kill,'' released last summer.
   ``Super Monaco GP is essentially one big Marlboro ad,'' said Dr.
John W. Richards of the Medical College of Georgia, who has
investigated the video advertisements.
   ``A child playing Super Monaco GP is exposed to literally
hundreds of Marlboro ads during the game, if he's good,'' Richards,
president of the anti-smoking group Doctors Ought to Care, wrote
last month in a letter of complaint to the Federal Trade Commission.
   ``If he's not good and doesn't reach `extended play,' then he'll
see only 50 or so Marlboro ads.''
   The commission, which regulates advertising, said its policy
prevented it from saying whether or not it was investigating the
practice.
   But Dr. Ronald M. Davis, director of the Office on Smoking and
Health of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, said: ``I think
it's regrettable at best, and scandalous at worst, that this is
happening. ...
   ``It's a strong indication that the cigarette industry is
interested in luring children to begin to smoke.''
   Smoking kills 390,000 Americans each year, and 90 percent of
smokers take up the habit as teen-agers, Davis said.
   Steven Weiss, manager of media relations for Philip Morris USA
in New York, said the company only recently found out about the use
of its products.
   ``Sega has not asked permission to use our logo and, moreover,
we would not grant such permission to use any of our cigarette
logos in any video game, especially those played by minors,'' he
said. ``All our cigarette advertising and promotions are directed
at informed adult smokers only.''
   Weiss said Philip Morris wrote to Sega on Nov. 20 asking it to
stop using the Marlboro logo and recall all games that include it.
   The letter was sent seven days after Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio,
told Philip Morris he was going to hold hearings on the video
advertising.
   According to the March 5, 1983, issue of the Medical Journal of
Australia, a game called Pole Position included the Marlboro logo
that year. The journal said a Philip Morris official in Australia
had been told then about the use of the logo.
   Scott Murdock, director of sales promotion and merchandising for
Anheuser Busch, said the company had not authorized the use of its
brand name or logo.
   ``Based on the information you have provided to us, we will ask
our legal department to investigate the matter,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev faced
protesters on his home soil for the first time last week, and the
whole nation watched.
   At every stop on Gorbachev's three-day tour of Lithuania, he
encountered people shouting ``Freedom!'' and waving placards
calling for independence for the small Baltic republic. Lithuania
was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 after a mere two
decades as a sovereign state.
   It was obvious even before Gorbachev left Moscow that he had no
chance of achieving his assigned task: persuading Lithuanian
Communists to reverse their decision to break with the national
Soviet party and support independence for Lithuania.
   Each night on national television news, millions of Soviets saw
Gorbachev confront the demonstrators, sometimes with humor,
sometimes with arguments.
   Where once carefully selected crowds would have been on hand to
cheer the Soviet leader and any open dissenters would have hustled
away by police, Gorbachev treated yelling protesters as if they
were an ordinary part of political life.
   Perhaps from now on, they will be.
   It seemed unlikely that Gorbachev, who has demonstrated his
extraordinary political acuity in redefining the postwar world,
would set himself up for failure in Lithuania. It appears now he
intended to demonstrate that even secessionists _ if peaceful _
will be fought with reason and logic, not tanks and troops.
   His conduct sent a message to others of the Soviet Union's
expanding numbers of separatists that the Kremlin is more likely to
accommodate political maneuvering toward independence, like that in
Lithuania, than the violence that erupted along the Iranian border
in Azerbaijan.
   Gorbachev's new policies of tolerating opposition political
parties and promising to put calls for secession to a vote, both
announced in Vilnius last week, are part of his strategy for
holding the union together through democratic means.
   Even if the Soviet empire does disintegrate, his approach could
provide an orderly, peaceful alternative to a chaotic collapse of
Soviet power.
   It was only nine months ago that Soviet troops armed with
shovels and gas waded into a singing, dancing crowd of 10,000
pro-independence demonstrators in Tbilisi, Georgia, killing 19
people. A Soviet parliamentary commission has condemned the
decision to use force against the peaceful protesters, but citizens
still worry openly that such force could be used again.
   They also know that Gorbachev has hard-line opponents, who are
more likely than he to crack down on those bent on leaving the
union.
   In a meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee in
December, Gorbachev condemned the use of force as a means of
combating the political views of a large segment of society. But
other senior party officials are believed to favor stronger action
to put down the secessionists.
   In tiny Lithuania, with just 3.7 million of the Soviet Union's
287 million people, the two-year fight for restoration of
independence has been determinedly peaceful.
   Gorbachev's trip was no different. Hundreds of thousands of
people packed the central square and all the surrounding streets of
Vilnius for a candlelit pro-independence demonstration Thursday
night on Gorbachev's first day in town. The president steered clear
of that rally, but at every stop, he met protesters carrying the
yellow, red and green flags of independent Lithuania, or chanting,
``Freedom!''
   Despite their fervor, the encounters were without exception
civil.
   At one stop, Gorbachev gazed at the posters calling for freedom
and joked, ``And you say you are not free.''
   Local police linked arms in a human chain to keep the crowds
from surging forward and overwhelming what Lithuanian officials
described as the first Soviet Communist Party chief to visit the
republic in its 50 years as part of the Soviet Union. But the
security was not unusually oppressive.
   There were no signs of heavily armed guards or sharpshooters,
and there did not appear to be any particular concern that the
Lithuanians would break their determination to stay peaceful.
   Behind closed doors with Lithuanian officials, according to some
of those present, Gorbachev kept hearing the same refrain:
independence.
   On the streets, where a decade ago billboards trumpeted ``Hail
to Labor'' and praised the Communist Party in red neon, downtown
Vilnius sported a new theme: ``Lithuania without sovereignty is
Lithuania without a future.''
   For Gorbachev and for the rest of his high-powered entourage,
including Politburo members Vadim Medvedev and Yuri Maslyukov, it
was an introduction to dealing with domestic political opponents
with a solid power base of their own.
   For top Soviet Communists, it is a new field on which they must
compete for the hearts and minds of their countrymen.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Ann Imse, a Moscow correspondent for The
Associated Press, has reported extensively on political

   Alex Machaskee, vice president and general
manager of The Plain Dealer, has been promoted to publisher and
Thomas H. Greer, executive editor, has become editor.
   The appointments were announced Sunday by Thomas Vail, who had
been president, editor and publisher and now becomes president and
chairman.
   ``I have great confidence in giving new day-to-day
responsibilities to two outstanding members of The Plain Dealer's
management team,'' Vail said.
   Machaskee, 52, has been with the newspaper 30 years during which
he served as promotion director, assistant to the publisher, labor
relations director, and general manager.
   He is a past president of the Ohio Newspaper Association and a
former president of the Cleveland Advertising Club.
   Greer, 47, was named managing editor of the newspaper in 1986
and executive editor in 1989. He was sports editor from 1983 to
1986.
   Greer was a Plain Dealer reporter before leaving in 1976 to
cover the National Basketball Association for the Chicago Sun-Times.
   He later became a sports feature writer and columnist at the
Philadelphia Daily News, was a sports columnist at the New York
Daily News and worked briefly on the staff of The Philadelphia
Inquirer.
   Vail, 63, became the newspaper's publisher and editor in 1963 at
age 36. During the past 26 years, The Plain Dealer has become the
state's largest daily and Sunday newspaper.

   When demonstrators stormed Leipzig's secret
police headquarters last month, it seemed the most despised
instrument of Communist state control was doomed.
   A citizens' group began sifting through the Leipzig files to pin
down names of secret police agents and informers. Somehow, nobody
noticed that nine Communist Party members had slipped in among the
16 ``volunteer'' investigators.
   Everywhere pro-democracy forces turn these days, East Germany's
Communists are still in positions of power. With free elections
less than four months away, they essentially control the government
and dominate political life.
   ``Basically, nothing has really changed,'' said a Leipzig state
railways employee. ``The Communist Party still has its people
everywhere, and they're just not going to leave,'' said the woman,
who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal.
   In East Germany's gray winter, the national euphoria sparked by
last fall's peaceful uprising has faded into the harsh realization
that 40 years of Stalinist rule cannot be overcome quickly.
   Sensing a troubled future, nearly 1,800 citizens are migrating
to West Germany every day in a continuing drain on the flagging
socialist economy.
   Opposition forces remain splintered, lacking a charismatic
figure like Solidarity leader Lech Walesa in Poland or Vaclav
Havel, Czechoslovakia's dissident-turned-president.
   Dravy Kuntzsch, a 20-year-old machinist, told a West German
newspaper he expects a powerful constituency, including party
members, secret police informers and people worried about their
jobs to ensure a Communist victory in the first free elections May
6.
   Last week, deep opposition mistrust erupted into a political
crisis that forced Communist Premier Hans Modrow to scrap plans for
creating a new secret police force before the election.
   Modrow rejected charges that his caretaker government is denying
opposition groups a fair chance in the elections, and extended a
vague offer of posts in his government.
   But Rainer Eppelmann, spokesman for the Democratic Awakening
opposition group, is wary. He complains that such offers are mere
``acts of mercy'' by the still firmly entrenched Communist Party.
   The secret police issue is especially sensitive because past
Communist leaders relied on the internal security network to crush
dissent.
   Modrow says he is dissolving and disarming the force, but
opposition activists worry that decades of tight bonds between the
Communists and their agents will persist.
   A leader of one reform group said he fears a mobilization of
loyal agents with weapons drawn from secret Communist-controlled
caches allegedly spread throughout the country.
   New Forum founding member Ralf Henrich, with an eye on recent
events in Romania, does not rule out such a ``big strike.''
   ``I hope it will not come, but we are worried,'' he told West
Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper. ``The Communist Party wants to
make people submissive again.''
   Despite a rush of resignations, the party still counts 1.4
million members in a country of 16.3 million people.
   The Communists still run television, radio and virtually all
printing plants. They control the nation's bureaucracy, factories,
postal and telephone service.
   Warning lights flashed when the Communists launched into the
election year with a media campaign against an alleged neo-Nazi
threat. Reform groups and West German politicians condemned the
move as a ploy to muzzle the opposition.
   ``The Communists justified all acts of violence since 1945 with
`anti-fascism,' '' wrote West German television journalist Fritz
Schenk, who fled East Germany in the 1950s.
   Over the weekend, the government took a new tack to woo West
German capital as well as voters dissatisfied with drabness:
Economics Minister Christa Luft, a Communist, called for radical
moves toward a market economy.
   Undoubtedly, once unthinkable criticism is now possible in East
Germany, after major changes in one of the Soviet bloc's most
repressive societies.
   Massive demonstrations starting last October forced the ouster
of hard-line leader Erich Honecker and the opening of East
Germany's western borders.
   In keeping with Eastern European trends, the Communists scrapped
their constitutional monopoly on power, promised to move toward
``democratic socialism'' and published revelations of corruption
among the old elite.
   But for many, contrition isn't enough and talk is cheap.
   In the new year's first demonstration at Leipzig, the birthplace
of last fall's unrest, anger against the continuing Communist hold
on power was rising among the more than 100,000 protesters.
   East German artist Wolfgang Mattheuer says it is not relatively
minor faults like the old leadership's privileged lifestyle _ ``a
few scoundrels' hunting lodges, sofas and swimming pools'' _ that
make people take to the streets.
   The real reason is that East Germans don't want another
Communist ``experiment,'', the 62-year-old party member commented
in a Leipzig newspaper.

   Resumption of relations by Syria and
Egypt takes the Arabs a step closer to the unity that has eluded
them for decades and reflects changes in the thinking of their
leaders.
   The rapprochement that ended a 12-year rift between two giants
of the Arab world comes amid other signs of growing cohesion among
Moslem states.
   It also underlines the more pragmatic approach Arab leaders are
now taking, turning away from the mirage of instant unification
that beguiled them for so many years.
   Their view of the world and their place in it has shifted over
the years, from the emotional concept of ``the Arab nation'' to the
harsh realities of coexistence with other power blocs _ and that
Israel is there to stay.
   The Arab League's push for an international Middle East peace
conference, under U.N. auspices, underlines the understanding that
Israel is a reality and cannot be crushed. The Palestine Liberation
Organization's recognition of Israel's right to exist exemplifies
that.
   The Syria-Egypt reconciliation is the latest step toward ending
decades of division in the Arab world.
   Syria and Jordan made up in 1985 after years of dispute. Last
year, Syria restored relations, broken off in 1986, with Morocco.
But Hafez Assad's Syria remains a bitter enemy of Iraq.
   Egypt came in from the cold in 1987 after a decade of ostracism
over its 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Marxist South Yemen and
conservative North Yemen are striving toward unity after a 20-year
split.
   In crisis-torn Lebanon, which Arab rivals have long used as a
proxy battleground, the 22-member Arab League brokered a peace
treaty in October aimed at ending the 14-year-old civil war.
   The treaty has stalled because of Christian leader Gen. Michel
Aoun's rejection of it.
   Last year, two regional alliances _ the four-nation Arab
Cooperation Council and the five-state Arab Mahgreb Union _ were
formed and grouped the nine countries in economic and defense blocs
founded on the common interests of their members rather than
outright political unity.
   They followed the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, formed in
1981.
   But analysts say these groups still have a long way to go before
they can become effective; the Arab world faces increasing economic
integration of Europe, its biggest trading bloc, and the
uncertainties posed by the partial crumbling of East-West power
blocs.
   ``It's wonderful that the leaders meet,'' said Kamel Abu Jaber,
president of Jordan's World Affairs Council. ``But does that mean
this is real unity? I don't think so.''
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt noted earlier this month: ``In
this region, we are concerned primarily with increasing our ability
to deal with the European entity that is moving fast toward unity
... this new giant that will not confine itself to the EEC
countries, but will extend to East European countries sooner or
later.''
   Jaber said: ``Looking at it in the historical perspective, the
regionalization of the Arab world, the attempt to make smaller
unity rather than one great Arab unity, is a reflection of a
certain maturity among ... Arab leaders.''
   The world's 210 million Arabs live in 21 countries across a
swath of territory that stretches from the Atlantic to the Indian
Ocean.
   They share a common language, Arabic, and culture, a history of
conquest and a majority religion, Islam.
   Despite a common enemy, Israel, and their quest for greater
unity, the modern history of the Arabs has often been one of
discord based in part on traditional tribal rivalries.
   Syria led the Arab boycott of Egypt after President Anwar Sadat
visited Jerusalem in 1977. It broke off relations with Cairo that
year and was followed by 16 other Arab countries when, two years
later, Cairo signed the only peace treaty between an Arab country
and Israel.
   President Assad still adamantly opposes the treaty while Mubarak
holds firmly to the agreement. It is a sign of the changing times
that this did not prevent them from resuming diplomatic relations
last month.
   Western diplomats in Damascus said the move was prompted largely
by Assad's desire to escape from increasing isolation in the region
following the Arab summit decision to readmit Egypt to the Arab
League.
   That left only maverick Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi
holding out against Cairo, although he too has been moving slowly
toward resuming diplomatic relations.
   Gadhafi is the last representative in the Arab world of the
unity fever that swept the region from the 1950s through the 1970s.
   But the history of mergers between Arab countries has been a
warning to the current generation of leaders, who remember the
fiasco of Egypt's three-year merger with Syria that broke down in
acrimony in 1961 with Damascus accusing Cairo of betrayal and of
wrecking its economy.
   The Gulf Cooperation Council, made up of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, was set up in
1981 after the Iran-Iraq war broke out.
   But, Jaber noted, ``nothing has come out of it except meetings
of the leaders, consultations rather than coordination.''
   The Arab Magreb Union, formed in February 1989, groups Libya,
Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritania. It aims to set up an
economic common market on the European model.
   Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and North Yemen set up the Arab Cooperation
Council in February 1989. But within months Cairo and Baghdad were
embroiled in a dispute over alleged mistreatment of the hundreds of
thousands of Egyptian workers in Iraq, casting doubt on the
grouping's effectiveness in dealing with precisely the kind of
issue it was set up to handle.
   Western diplomats in Damascus say Mubarak would clearly like to
play match-maker between Assad and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
to settle the remaining critical inter-Arab rift.
   But they note that the enmity is so deep that Mubarak is
unlikely to make much headway.

<HEAD>Report Finds Shelters Fail to Meet Many Needs of Homeless Youths</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government-funded shelters that help homeless
youths often fail to continue aid after the maximum 15-day stay,
leaving the young people without job training or other skills,
congressional investigators report.
   ``This is a troubling picture,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.,
who asked the General Accounting Office to study a federal program
that aids homeless youngsters and runaways.
   ``Shelters offer a safe haven for homeless youths, and that's
important,'' Simon said Sunday. ``But we need to offer more than a
safe haven.''
   In 1977, Congress expanded a shelter program for runaways by
adding homeless youths, but investigators said the problems
experienced by the two groups often require different solutions.
   GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, studied 1985-88 data
submitted by federally funded shelters and interviewed shelter
employees and experts on homeless youngsters. Investigators found:
   _21 percent, or 9,179 of the 44,274 youths at the shelters, were
homeless.
   _61 percent of the homeless were without a place to live because
of a problem with a parent or other adult.
   _26 percent were physically or sexually abused.
   _22 percent had a drug or alcohol problem, but only 3 percent
were treated.
   ``The data do not show why the services rendered did not match
youths' problems,'' the report said, ``but resource constraints and
the focus on short-term care are possible reasons.''
   Investigators said services planned for homeless youths after
they complete the maximum 15-day stay at a shelter ``may not be
sufficient,'' and 46 percent of the youths got nothing.
   ``While homeless youth are at risk of leaving school and
one-third get educational services while at the shelter, less than
10 percent have educational after-care services planned,'' the
report said. ``Employment and job training for these youth are
almost nonexistent.''
   GAO said most homeless youths are male and 16 years or older.
   After staying in a shelter, their next destination may offer
little stability, the report said, adding that 14 percent planned
to live with a friend or on a street, and another 6 percent planned
to go to a new shelter.
   Simon's legislation, approved in 1988 and financed by Congress
last year, established a $10 million independent living program for
older homeless teens. Under the plan, housing is offered in group
settings, and older teens stay until they can live on their own,
from a few months to a year.
   ``They don't choose to leave home as runaways do,'' Simon said.
``This is the last chance to reach them before they become adults.''

<HEAD>Americans are World's Biggest Poultry Eaters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's biggest beef eaters continue to be
in Argentina, but when it comes to poultry no one can hold a
chicken leg to the Americans.
   Preliminary forecasts by the Agriculture Department also show
that Hungary will retain the world's per capita pork-eating crown
in 1990, while New Zealand continues leading the lamb-and-mutton
flock.
   The figures were compiled by the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service, based on estimated 1990 production of red
meat and poultry. Although the statistics are not true ``world''
figures, the leading producing countries were included in the
various categories.
   Weights of the red meats were expressed in ``carcass weight''
equivalents before slaughtered animals are carved into retail cuts.
The poultry weights were in ``ready to cook'' equivalents, which
still includes bone.
   For beef and veal, more than 50 countries were listed by region.
North America _ Canada, Mexico and the United States _ led
regionally with an expected 1990 per capita consumption of 38.6
kilograms, or 84.9 pounds, allowing 2.2 pounds per kilo.
   The U.S. per capita consumption of beef and veal led the region
at 97.7 pounds, which is much heftier than most other countries
checked. Altogether, the 50-country average is expected to be
slightly more than 25 pounds this year.
   South America as a region was forecast at only 22.1 kilograms,
on the average, or about 48.6 pounds per capita this year. But
there are large differences. Brazil, for example, is expected to
consume only about 29.2 pounds of beef and veal, while Argentina
heads the list at 139 pounds.
   But Argentina has been declining in recent years as a beef
consumer, and Uruguay is close behind in the per capita race,
averaging 137 pounds in the 1990 projections.
   In the 12-nation European Economic Community, which was forecast
at 49.3 pounds of beef and veal this year on a per capita basis,
France leads with 62.7 pounds over Italy, 57.6 pounds. On the
average 1990 EEC consumption was forecast at 49.3 pounds.
   Eastern Europe as a region was forecast at 37.2 pounds of beef
and veal this year, and the Soviet Union is expected to average 66
pounds per person.
   As Oceania, Australia and New Zealand are expected to average
82.3 pounds of beef and veal consumed in 1990, with Australia
having the slight edge.
   The Far East has no world-class beef eaters, according to the
USDA list. Hong Kong leads at 34.8, with Japan next at 20 pounds
per capita. China's average for 1990 is about 1.98 pounds per
person, and India's is 1.5 pounds.
   Other highlights:
   PORK
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. forecast is an average of 67.1 pounds in 1990, trailing
Canada's 73.5 pounds but well above Mexico's 16.2 pounds. North
America: 55.4 pounds per person this year.
   Those levels are far below the EEC, where the average is
expected to be 80.5 pounds per capita this year, led by Denmark
with 138 pounds. West Germany is expected to average 114.2 pounds.
   Eastern Europe, however, leads all regions in pork consumption,
with a forecast of more than 100 pounds per person this year. That
includes an average of 148 pounds in Hungary and 140.6 pounds in
East Germany.
   Pork consumption in the Soviet Union was forecast at 51.9
pounds, about the same as in recent years.
   In Asia, China's pork consumption was forecast at 41.6 pounds
per person, but Hong Kong's 100 pounds topped the region. Most
other major areas were also-rans in the pork category.
   The average for 39 countries was 37.4 pounds of pork per person
in 1990.
   LAMB, MUTTON AND GOAT MEAT
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Collectively, per capita consumption in North America _ Mexico
and the United States _ was forecast at 1.78 pounds, with the U.S.
average at 1.5 pounds. No figures for Canada were listed.
   For 32 countries listed, the per capita consumption was forecast
at 3.7 pounds, with large variations among some.
   Uruguay was forecast to consume 54.3 pounds in 1990, but South
America overall was shown at 9.7 pounds.
   In the EEC, average consumption of lamb, mutton and goat meat
was forecast at 8.6 pounds, led by Greece at 30.6 pounds. The
Netherlands, by contrast, was shown at 1.54 pounds.
   But in New Zealand the average consumption is expected to be 66
pounds per person this year. Add a lesser appetite for Australia
and the average for Oceania is 50.8 pounds.
   POULTRY, INCLUDING CHICKENS AND TURKEYS
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The United States is expected to consume an average of 90.4
pounds of total poultry per person in 1990, compared to an average
of 17.2 pounds for 30 countries listed. There was no breakdown by
region.
   Israel is second at 75.7 pounds per capita, followed by Hong
Kong, 68.2 pounds; Canada, 60 pounds; and Saudi Arabia, 56.3
pounds. The Soviet Union is forecast to consume 25.5 pounds of
total poultry this year.

   The brief failure of a guidance
system component sounded an alarm that wakened Columbia's
astronauts Sunday night, but a computer shifted to a backup unit
and the crew was told to go back to bed.
   Mission Control reported the problem was a transient electrical
signal in an accelerometer that is part of an Intertial Measurment
Unit.
   When the alarm sounded in the cabin, commander Dan Brandenstein
radioed the control center and asked if there were anything he
could do.
   Controllers told him, the spaceship computer had shifted to a
second IMU and everything was OK.
   There are three such devices aboard. Only one is needed for a
safe flight.
   When the astronauts were wakened at the regular time later, they
were told the problem had gone away, that the original unit was
being put back on line.
   ``Good morning for your second wakeup of the morning,'' Mission
Control said.
   The astronauts on Sunday were passed the halfway point of their
10-day space journey.
   After releasing one satellite and rescuing another last week,
the five astronauts turned their attention to secondary goals _
several scientific and medical tests.
   ``Welcome on board Columbia on a Sunday afternoon,''
Brandenstein said while shuttle cameras beamed down sweeping views
of the Earth. ``Our Sunday, I think, was much like everyone else's
Sunday around the country. It was probably one of our easier days
during the mission.''
   ``We're at the midpoint, and the high visibility and exciting
activities of Syncom deploy and rendezvous are behind us, but we're
still working on numerous objectives in the materials processing
and the extended duration orbiter medical experiments.''
   Syncom, a Navy communications satellite, was released Wednesday.
The Long Duration Exposure Facility, a scientific laboratory that
had been in orbit nearly six years, was captured by the crew Friday
and is now in the shuttle's cargo bay.
   Brandenstein said crew members also filmed parts of the Earth
with the powerful IMAX camera, including the Galapagos Islands in
the Pacific. The IMAX footage is to be used in a film called ``The
Blue Planet.''
   Assessing the first half of the trip, flight director Al
Pennington said, ``It has been a flawless flight. We have a
beautifully running orbiter.''
   The 10-day flight is the second-longest in 33 shuttle missions
and is intended as a stepping stone toward longer shuttle flights
and months-long stints aboard space station Freedom. Columbia is
scheduled to land Friday at 2:59 a.m. PST at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif.
   Some of the television shots beamed to Earth showed mission
specialist Bonnie Dunbar checking on an experiment that suffered a
mishap Friday but was repaired Sunday.
   The experiment involves melting and resolidifying a metal,
indium, which melts at a relatively low temperature. It was shut
down while scientists on the ground studied videotape of a crack
that had developed in a glass container, or ampul, within the
experiment apparatus. Experts were concerned that the cracked glass
could shatter, sending shards floating in the crew cabin.
   On Sunday, Dunbar, wearing a mask and gloves, removed the
cracked container and carefully vacuumed the machine, Pennington
said. No glass fragments were discovered during the cleanup, and
the broken ampul was replaced with a new one.
   The camera also showed pilot Jim Wetherbee running on a
treadmill at about the same time his 70-year-old mother, Althea,
was competing in the Houston-Tenneco Marathon.
   Mrs. Wetherbee, an avid runner who participates in about two
marathons a year, said she would keep glancing to the heavens to
get inspiration to run the 26.2-mile marathon. She and her husband,
Dana, live in Huntington Station, N.Y., but they came to Houston to
keep track of her son's first shuttle mission.

<HEAD>Ballet Theater Celebrates 50th Anniversary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American Ballet Theater, which will celebrate
its 50th anniversary all year, kicked off the celebration with a
three and a half-hour gala. The top ticket price was $1,250.
   There were excerpts from ballets, speeches and films, excitement
and artistic glory.
   The most remarkable performance Sunday night was the Act 2 pas
de deux from ``Swan Lake'' by Alicia Alonso, who made her debut
with the company one year after it began. She was partnered by
Orlando Salgado. The music was played very slowly and the dance was
poignant and beautiful.
   An Act 3 ``Swan Lake'' duet, next to last on the program, was
received with a roar, as it was danced by two great favorites with
the audience. Cynthia Gregory, who has celebrated 25 years with
Ballet Theater, was partnered by the fiery Fernando Bujones, who
left the company after a dispute with Mikhail Baryshnikov.
   Baryshnikov, who resigned suddenly in September as Ballet
Theater's artistic director, was not present. Neither was
choreographer Jerome Robbins, who sent a message which was read.
   Baryshnikov was praised by several speakers and was seen in the
films. Also highly praised were the late Lucia Chase, founder of
the company with Richard Pleasant, director of it with Oliver Smith
for 35 years and believer in varied repertoire, the late Antony
Tudor, choreographer of dramatic and psychological ballets, and
choreographer Agnes de Mille.
   Twyla Tharp introduced snippets from the eight ballets she has
choreographed for Ballet Theater. ``Push Comes to Shove,'' her
first, in 1976, was danced last and longest. Danilo Radojevic, in
the part she created for Baryshnikov, found himself pushed and
shoved aside by a dancer dressed just like him _ Miss Tharp.
   The evening began with excerpts from dances from the first 25
years, ``Les Sylphides,'' three by Tudor, including Carla Fracci in
``The Lilac Garden,'' the three sailors' solos from ``Fancy Free.''
Associate artistic director John Taras said that Jerome Robbins was
tired of dancing Russian peasants, Spanish lovers, Greek gods and
sheaves of wheat so he choreographed ``Fancy Free'' and danced a
sailor. An excerpt from Agnes de Mille's ``Rodeo'' was danced
charmingly by Victor Barbee and Kathleen Moore as the cowgirl, Miss
de Mille's original role.
   After excerpts from Robbins' ``Les Noces,'' Eliot Feld's ``At
Midnight'' and Alvin Ailey's ``The River,'' the evening ended with
14 classical ballet excerpts. All were outstanding, with Susan
Jaffe's balance in the Rose Adagio from ``The Sleeping Beauty''
calling for special mention.
   Miss de Mille spoke, saying she'd been looking for ``the
intrinsic American'' and getting laughs as she enumerated character
traits. Dancer Natalia Makarova was funny, telling about her first
entrance via an American trap door. Other speakers were Oliver
Smith, dancer Gelsey Kirkland, Feld and dancer Igor Youskevitch,
who introduced the final ``Theme and Variations,'' which George
Balanchine choreographed for him and Miss Alonso in 1947.
   American Ballet Theater has presented 750 dancers in 385 ballets
by 168 choreographers in its 50 years.
   There was so much demand for tickets to the gala that another
one is planned for May 7.

<HEAD>Photographer Seeks to Dive to Wreck of the `Monitor'</HEAD>

   A Philadelphia photographer is a step closer
to becoming the first person in 11 years to win federal permission
to dive to the wreck of the Civil War ship Monitor.
   But one hurdle remains before Gary Gentile can realize his
obsession.
   Gentile, 43, has filed 11 permit applications and written more
than 50 letters to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration in his quest to photograph the Monitor, which he
calls ``America's most famous shipwreck.''
   As part of his bid, Gentile has enlisted the aid of fellow scuba
enthusiasts, reporters and Rep. Robert Borski, D-Pa.
   NOAA, part of the Commerce Department, is responsible for
safeguarding the wreckage 16 miles off Cape Hatteras, N.C. The
Monitor sank in a gale after a celebrated battle with the
Confederate ship Merrimack. The Merrimack was destroyed by its crew
to prevent it from being captured by Union forces.
   Gentile and his attorney, fellow diver Peter Hess of Wilmington,
Del., won a victory on Jan. 4 when NOAA reversed its earlier
decision denying permission to dive to the 128-year-old wreck
because of safety concerns. Hess hopes to accompany Gentile on the
expedition.
   The Monitor is buried in about 220 feet of water, and NOAA had
previously said the depth poses ``a serious and unreasonable risk.''
   But NOAA's new ruling said agency officials had been too
stringent in applying guidelines regarding potentially risky dives.
However, the agency stopped short of issuing the permit that
Gentile and Hess have sought for five years.
   Instead, the opinion of John J. Carey of NOAA's National Ocean
Service outlined a series of factors he said must be considered
before a permit is issued. The factors included Gentile's
responsibility to the public and the appropriateness of his
research methods.
   Any information Gentile uncovers must be made available to the
public, Carey said. In addition, he said Gentile and his divers
must agree not to hold the government responsible for injuries,
since the dive is deeper than normally permitted.
   Hess said in an interview Friday he was worried because no
schedule was set for issuing the permit. In addition, he said he
fears additional conditions for the dive could be imposed later.
   He said he wrote NOAA a letter last week requesting a ``time
frame for agency action.''
   NOAA allowed French explorer Jacques Cousteau's party to dive to
the Monitor in 1979. But the weather and visibility was poor, and
virtually no usable pictures resulted. No one has been permitted to
dive to the site since, although NOAA got some pictures from a
remote device in 1987.
   Gentile has said he hopes to make the expedition in June or July
and to publish a book about it.

<HEAD>Fewer Low-Income Blacks, Hispanics Going to College</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low- and middle-income blacks and Hispanics
have seen a ``major regression'' in college attendance since the
mid-1970s, according to the American Council on Education.
   Based on Census Bureau figures, the college participation rate
for dependent low-income black high school graduates between 18 and
24 years old dropped from 39.8 percent in 1976 to 30.3 percent in
1988, said the Eighth Annual Status Report on Minorities in Higher
Education.
   For Hispanics, the rate fell from 50.4 percent to 35.3 percent
over the same period, ``indicating an educational failure rate of
intolerable magnitude,'' said the report, released today by the
council's Office of Minority Concerns.
   ``Since the mid-1970s, the college participation of African
Americans and Hispanics has been a picture not of progress, but of
major regression,'' the report said.
   Low-income white high school graduates made a slight gain in
college participation, rising from 36.8 percent to 38.8 percent,
the report said.
   Deborah Carter, who compiled the study for the Washington-based
education group along with Reginald Wilson, said the focus was on
the high school completion and college participation patterns of
low-income and middle-income black and Hispanic youth living at
home with their families.
   The study said the bulk of the black and Hispanic youths, 51
percent and 45 percent, respectively, were from families with
incomes under $18,581. Twenty-five percent of the blacks and 33
percent of the Hispanics had family incomes between $18,582 and
$33,510, and 16 percent of the blacks and 17 percent of the
Hispanics had family incomes of between $33,511 to $52,119, the
report said.
   Eight percent of the black youth and 5 percent of Hispanic youth
were from families with incomes of $52,120 and above.
   Middle-income blacks and Hispanics showed the most severe
declines in college participation during the late 1970s and early
1980s, said the report. By 1988, the college participation rate of
middle-income blacks had fallen to 36.2 percent from 52.7 percent
in 1976, with black males hit most severely.
   Corresponding rates for Hispanics were 46.4 percent in 1988
compared with 53.4 percent in 1976.
   The report showed that as a group, the number of degrees earned
by minorities, including blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans and
American Indians, increased from 1976 to 1987, with jumps of 30.9
percent in bachelor's degrees and 63.4 percent for
first-professional degrees.
   But blacks sustained the greatest losses among all racial and
ethnic groups. From 1976 to 1987, the number of blacks earning
bachelor's degrees fell 4.3 percent, from 59,122 degrees to 56,554
degrees. For black males the drop was 12.2 percent, from 25,634 to
22,498 bachelor's degrees.
   Blacks earned 6.4 percent of the 918,388 bachelor's degrees
awarded in 1976, but only 5.7 percent of the 991,264 bachelor's
degrees in 1987. Hispanics earned 2 percent of the degrees in 1976
and 2.7 percent in 1987.
   The report also said that from 1976 to 1988, high school
completion rates increased for blacks and Hispanics ages 18 to 24.
In 1988, 43 percent of low-income Hispanic males and 53 percent of
low-income black males completed high school, compared with 60
percent of low-income Hispanic females and 69 percent of low-income
black females.
   For all races and incomes, 80.5 percent graduated high school in
1976, compared with 81.2 percent in 1988. College enrollment for
all high school grads increased from 53.4 percent in 1976 to 57.5
percent in 1988.
   ``Given the low high school completion rate of low-income
African American and Hispanic youth, and given that less than
one-third of low-income African American and Hispanic high school
graduates enroll in college, one realizes that as a nation we have
not come close to addressing the post-secondary educational needs
of low-income minority youth,'' the report said.

   Former U.S. Sen. Joseph S. Clark, a civil
rights advocate in Congress and champion of reform in Philadelphia,
has died. He was 88.
   Clark died at his home Friday, said his wife, Iris. No cause of
death was given.
   In 1951, Clark became the city's first Democratic mayor in 63
years, ending a corruption-ridden Republican administration. Five
years later, in 1956, Clark was elected to the first of two U.S.
Senate terms.
   In the Senate, he gained distinction as an intelligent and
forceful civil rights advocate, one of the earliest critics of the
Vietnam War and a proponent of congressional reform.
   ``He was an outstanding U.S. senator and public servant. No
public servant has done more for the city than Joe Clark,'' said
Mayor W. Wilson Goode.
   Thacher Longstreth, a political opponent but a personal friend,
recalled the days when Clark and the late former Mayor Richardson
Dilworth crusaded for reform.
   ``They were responsible for the halcyon days of 1952 to 1960,
when the quality of municipal government in Philadelphia was so
high,'' said Longstreth, a Republican city councilman.
   A private funeral was held for family members Sunday afternoon.
A memorial service will be Saturday at the Unitarian Church of
Germantown.

<HEAD>Hispanics Almost Twice as Likely to be Robbed, Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hispanics were more likely than non-Hispanics
to be victims of violent crimes _ particularly robbery _ during the
seven years ending in 1986, the Justice Department reports.
   Eleven of every 1,000 Hispanics age 12 or older were robbed
between 1979 and 1986, compared to a rate of six robberies per
1,000 non-Hispanics, the study said Sunday.
   It said Hispanics were more likely to be victims of violent
crime during the period, though the victimization rate for this
category dropped from 44 violent crimes per 1,000 Hispanics in 1979
to 29 in 1986.
   The violent crime rate for non-Hispanic victims was generally
lower during the seven-year period than for Hispanics, according to
the study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   It dropped from 38 per 1,000 people in 1979 to 31 in 1986, the
only year of the period when the violent crime rate among
non-Hispanics was higher than Hispanics.
   The study said that Hispanics were more likely to be crime
victims than other Americans because as a group they tended to be
younger, poorer and more concentrated in central cities. These
demographic characteristics are associated with high crime, it said.
   Even controlling for these factors, the study said, the robbery
rate for Hispanics was still higher than for non-Hispanics.
   ``Hispanic and non-Hispanic people who share the same
demographic traits had generally comparable crime victim rates,
except for robbery and, to a lesser degree, aggravated assault,''
Joseph Besette, the bureau's director, said in a statement.
   Hispanics were also more likely to be victims of crimes such as
burglary, car thefts and household larcenies, the study said.
   During the seven-year period, the average annual rate of such
household crimes was 266 per 1,000 Hispanic homes compared to a
rate of 205 for non-Hispanic homes, the study said.
   The statistics were gathered from the National Crime Survey,
which canvasses 100,000 Americans age 12 or older. Those surveyed
are interviewed twice a year in 50,000 households.

<HEAD>Jury for Computer Hacking Trial Intentionally `Computer
Illiterate'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert T. Morris has been described as a
genius, yet the jury judging his computer hacking trial is
comprised of software illiterates _ and deliberately so.
   Morris, 25, a suspended Cornell University graduate student, is
charged with computer tampering for allegedly unleashing a wildly
replicating ``worm'' program that temporarily immobilized a U.S.
computer network in November 1988.
   Lawyers say it's not uncommon to fill a jury with people
unfamiliar with a subject that is central to a trial, but it can be
a gamble.
   ``It's a trial strategy one has to decide,'' says Theodore
Hagelin, a computer law professor and director of the Law
Technology and Management program at Syracuse University.
   ``But you run a real risk of losing them in the flood of
information and definitions they must listen to.''
   U.S. Justice Department lawyers Ellen Meltzer and Mark Rasch and
defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni interviewed 23 prospective jurors
to hear the case, and both sides focused on computer literacy.
   So did U.S. District Judge Howard Munson, who asked potential
jurors if they owned a computer or knew how to use them.
   ``No, I don't know a thing about them,'' said a woman who then
was selected.
   The only three prospective jurors who said they owned a personal
computer were rejected, although two jurors who worked with
computers at their jobs _ an airline reservation clerk and
insurance claims processor _ were accepted. Twelve jurors and one
alternate were seated.
   During much of the first three days of testimony last week,
jurors listened as witnesses painstakingly tried to simplify the
high-technology world of computers, explaining alien terms like
``e-mail,'' ``finger demons'' and ``decompilation,'' or the
differences among source codes, assembly codes and binary codes.
   Even the court reporter has struggled to keep up with the jargon.
   Rasch and Guidoboni declined to talk about the jury selection,
but Hagelin said there is sound reason behind the strategy.
   ``By choosing jurors that are not particularly sophisticated
about technology you create a juror pool with an open mind, or at
least you hope so,'' he said.
   Harold L. Burstyn, a lawyer specializing in computer law, said
one computer expert could contaminate the jury.
   ``You'd have to be deathly afraid that one individual, claiming
to be an expert or being an expert, would get all the other jurors
to follow him because of his knowledge, rather than because of
their belief in guilt or innocence,'' Burstyn said.
   Jurors lacking great knowledge of computers would be better able
to follow the instructions of law given by the judge, Burstyn said.
   Still, prosecutors must educate jurors sufficiently before
ending their case, Hagelin said.
   ``On one level you have to get them to understand what
happened,'' he said. ``But on a second level you have to put it a
way that won't swamp them, a way that will stay in their minds when
they go to their room to deliberate. The real trick is to find the
balance. They can only follow so far.''
   In the end, the case may be decided by which attorney can
provide the most succinct and powerful metaphor to translate the
case to its most simplest terms, Burstyn and Hagelin agreed.
   Morris, of Arnold, Md., is the first person charged under a
section of the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act dealing with
federal computer networks. He faces up to five years in prison and
a $250,000 fine if convicted.
   Prosecutors allege he designed and unleashed a ``worm'' program
that immobolized an estimated 6,000 computers linked to the
Internet research computer network, including those at National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and Air Force facilities and
several universities.
   The defense has said Morris created the ``worm'' as a computer
security experiment, but that he made a programming mistake that
let the worm go berserk. He has said Morris did not intend to cause
any damage.
   Testimony continues Tuesday with government witnesses scheduled
to take the stand.

<HEAD>$22 Million Awarded to Families in Vaccine Compensation Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Families whose children died or showed
injuries after being vaccinated for whooping cough and other
diseases can seek restitution without litigation under a claims
system that already has awarded victims $22 million, federal
officials say.
   The system administered by the U.S. Claims Court provides
families an alternative to time-consuming, sometimes fruitless
lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies and doctors.
   ``The compensation program is designed to be fast, flexible and
efficient while protecting the family's right to a fair and
impartial decision,'' said Gary Golkiewicz, who oversees a staff of
specially appointed claims court lawyers handling vaccine cases.
   Created by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986,
the program also covers injuries linked to vaccines for measles,
mumps, rubella and polio. The system is financed by congressional
appropriations and an excise tax on the sale of vaccines.
   The claims court awarded $1 million to Joshua Schroeder, who
experienced seizures after being given two shots of a childhood
vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough).
Joshua, now 12, is developmentally retarded.
   ``I think this compensation system is better than trying to
fight the doctors or trying to fight the drug manufacturers,'' said
Brenda Meland, Joshua's mother. ``The money doesn't change him, but
it sure helps us help him.''
   Mrs. Meland's son suffered convulsions within hours of receiving
DPT shots. She suspected the vaccine as the cause, but decided not
to file a lawsuit.
   Insurance covered most of Joshua's medical costs, and Mrs.
Meland said she ``didn't want to get in front of'' lawyers for drug
companies and doctors who would be ``questioning us, making us feel
like it was our fault'' as they searched for other possible causes
for the boy's problems.
   Some 57,000 U.S. children receive DPT vaccines each week. Most
children receive four DPT shots before age 2. Vaccination against
DPT is required by state laws for admission to school.
   Some children experience pain, swelling and high fever after
being given the injections. Severe reactions include seizures.
Doctors generally attribute the reaction to the pertussis portion
of the vaccine, although debate rages in the scientific community
on the question of whether it causes permanent injury.
   Leaders of the American Academy of Pediatrics are recommending
that the academy adopt a policy statement saying there is no proof
that DPT causes severe neurologic disease or death.
   Under the compensation system, families don't face the legal
burden of proving to a jury that the vaccine caused the injury or
death and that a pharmaceutical company or doctor was negligent.
   Instead, compensation goes to children who develop specific
symptoms within a certain period after being immunized and suffer
an injury that lasts at least six months. The payment is made as
long as the government doesn't prove the injury was due to some
other cause.
   Claims must be processed within a year of being filed. In the
system's 14 months of operation, $22.4 million has been awarded for
43 deaths and injuries occurring before Oct. 1, 1988. Another 18
claims have been rejected or were voluntarily withdrawn when it
became clear the families would not receive an award.
   Parents' groups, vaccine manufacturers and physicians lobbied to
get the program through Congress.
   ``I think it's still too early to say whether this system will
handle all claims and relieve all the problems providers and
manufacturers have faced with lawsuits,'' said Ron Saldarini,
president and chief executive officer for Lederle-Praxis
Biologicals in Wayne, N.J., a manufacturer of DPT vaccine.
   ``I want it to work. It's in everybody's best interests,''
Saldarini said.
   The system has experienced problems and has been the target of
criticism.
   The program ``has set unscientific precedents for what is and is
not a vaccine-related injury,'' Dr. Edward A. Mortimer,
representing the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a paper
this month to the Institute of Medicine.
   Mortimer said the ``unfortunate row'' linking DPT vaccine to
brain damage and death has ``become rather reminiscent of a Salem
witch hunt.''

<HEAD>Drug Summit Set After U.S., South American Accord for Anti-Drug
Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTA CRUZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cocaine-producing countries of
Bolivia, Colombia and Peru have agreed to launch, through
coordinated use of their armed forces, an ``unstoppable assault on
drug traffickers.''
   The United States also signed the agreement Sunday for the
increased anti-drug efforts, but South American delegates said the
accord leaves out any language that might open the door to direct
U.S. intervention in the fight.
   The text of the plan will be kept secret until President Bush
and at least two of the South American presidents sign it at a drug
summit Feb. 15 in Colombia, officials said.
   ``We are very satisfied,'' said Michael Skol, a deputy assistant
secretary of state who led the U.S. delegation. He declined to
elaborate.
   The agreement, reached after a five-day preparatory meeting,
represents ``an integral commitment by the four countries, which
have proposed carrrying out a frontal and unstoppable assault on
narcotics trafficking,'' said Bolivia's foreign minister, Carlos
Iturralde.
   Iturralde said the accord recognizes the need for more U.S.
economic aid to the South American countries, which in turn
committed themselves to a full-fledged military campaign against
the multibillion-dollar cocaine industry.
   ``Until recently, we perhaps haven't wanted to accept the
reality of narcotics trafficking,'' he said. Before, ``we limited
ourself to police action.''
   Under the agreement, the South American countries are committed
to using ``all the means they have available,'' including the armed
forces, in the war on trafficking, he said.
   His speech, which covered the agreement in general terms,
concluded the meeting at 4:30 a.m. Sunday, one day later than
planned.
   A one-paragraph statement from the delegations said they
``achieved the goals'' set for them and expected a successful
summit, which would adopt the ``joint, integral and coordinated
strategy against ... illegal drugs and their economic and social
effects.''
   Delegates said the delay was prompted by arguments over how U.S.
asssistance should be directed and what conditions would be
attached to it.
   The United States insists that the flow of aid money depends on
a country's dedication and performance in the anti-drug effort.
   Bush and Presidents Virgilio Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz
Zamora of Bolivia are to sign the agreement at the summit in
Cartagena, Colombia. President Alan Garcia of Peru has said he will
attend only if U.S. troops are withdrawn from Panama by then, but
his government will send a representative in any case.
   Some delegates, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States agreed to a request to provide aid in cases where the
anti-drug campaign hurt a South American country's economy.
   The United States has pressed producer countries to use their
military against traffickers, saying police alone cannot handle the
powerful drug cartels.
   But some South American countries fear it would expose their
poorly paid armed forces to drug dealers' bribes and corruption. In
1980, Bolivian military leaders linked to traffickers seized power
in a coup and ruled for a year.
   Several South American delegates said the issue of patrolling
international waters or air space was left out of the document. A
U.S. plan to put an aircraft carrier group off Colombia's coast to
monitor smuggling was delayed last week when the Colombians
objected.
   The Colombian delegation was emphatic in making sure the
agreement contained nothing that might allow direct U.S. military
action in the region, conference sources said.
   The conference was held at a hotel in Santa Cruz, Bolivia's
second biggest city and a center for shipping raw cocaine to
Colombian laboratories for processing.
   Most of the world's coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine, is
grown in Peru and Bolivia. Colombia is the principal center for
refining and smuggling the drug to the United States and other user
countries.

   Lewis's agent, Dick Fox Productions Inc. of New York, is seeking
$135,000 that Lewis would have been paid for September 1989 and
February 1990 performances that were canceled, according to the
lawsuit.
   Lewis canceled the September show because of illness and his
agent charges that Trump Castle wrongly eliminated the February
dates. Dick Fox Productions, in a lawsuit filed in Superior Court,
said the contract permits sickness.

problems.
   About 6,000 people showed up at a benefit show in which Ms.
Winfrey encouraged adults to support and nurture children and to
bring underprivileged children into their homes.
   ``Let this city be the model city for making a change, making a

   Sydney Biddle Barrows, the so-called ``Mayflower
Madam'' who was busted for promoting prostitution, is using her
expertise to promote good manners in matters of intimacy.
   ``Mayflower Manners: Etiquette for Consenting Adults,'' includes
advice on how to ask a date about AIDS, whether condoms should be
left where they can be seen and when it is OK to make a pass.
   The 221-page book, written by Barrows and Ellis Weiner and
published by Doubleday, also describes how to approach an escort
service.
   ``When inquiring as to which young ladies are available for that
evening, don't ask crudely, `Whaddaya got tonight?''' she wrote.
Instead, she said, clients should wait to be asked what sort of
companion they would prefer.
   Barrows, who ran three escort services, pleaded guilty in July
1985 to a misdemeanor charge of promoting prostitution, and paid a
$5,000 fine.
   She has been working as a $10 per hour dresser at fashion shows
and answering telephones at an aerobics studio, according to the

premature, are in Grady's special care nursery.
   Mrs. Leland was about six weeks pregnant when her 44-year-old
husband was killed Aug. 7 in a plane crash in Ethiopia while on a
hunger relief mission. Leland, a Democrat, was first elected to
Congress from Houston's 18th District in 1978.
   Mrs. Leland was in Atlanta to accept a ``Salute to Greatness''
award on Leland's behalf from the King Center on Saturday night.
   In late August, Mrs. Leland declined to run for his seat in
Congress, saying her top priorities were her son _ Jarrett, now 4 _
and the ``new baby on the way.''

   George Foreman is finding if you hang
around long enough, you can realize a boxer's dream _ getting paid
to punch a promoter.
   In a scheduled 10-round bout tonight, the 41-year-old Foreman
will meet Gerry Cooney, who promoted two of the former heavyweight
champion's fights in his comeback.
   The 33-year-old Cooney, also attempting a comeback, promoted
Foreman's fourth-round knockout of Carlos Hernandes at Atlantic
City and his second-round knockout of Ladislas Mijangos at Fort
Myers, Fla., both in 1988.
   Cooney hopes he has less trouble with Foreman in the ring than
he did in his two promotional ventures with the punching preacher.
Foreman threatened to pull out of both matches on fight day.
   ``I don't know if it was him or his people,'' said Cooney, who
still has a promoter's license. ``I sure would like to keep
involved in promoting. It's nice to watch a young kid develop into
a champion and as a human being.''
   The bout, dubbed ``Geezers at Caesars'' by some writers, has
been criticized as a shamless burlesque for exploiting both the
fighters and the paying public. Each fighter is guaranteed $1
million.
   The fight, promoted by Bob Arum in association with Caesars
Atlantic City, will be shown on pay-per-view and closed-circuit
television.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stores are empty, shuttered,
lined with empty shelves or faceless rows of nude mannequins
stacked against walls.
   In the streets, American soldiers with painted faces gather
under trees, relax behind sandbags or crouch next to coils of
concertina wire.
   ``Hola!'' they venture to passing women.
   Twenty-six days after 26,000 U.S. troops toppled Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, Panama City is wobbling toward normality.
   In the first hours of the Dec. 20 invasion, seismologists say
the earth shook from 417 major explosions.
   Most of the blasts appear to have rattled the poor neighborhood
of El Chorrillo, where Noriega's military heaquarters crumbled
under the weight of U.S. firepower.
   Nearby, carcasses of cars _ some overturned, some on their sides
_ are rusting in the hot sun.
   The small apartments of El Chorillo, the Little Stream, are
gutted from the fires and gunfire and mortars that echoed through
this city for a couple days while Noriega loyalists fought U.S.
forces.
   The battles drove thousands from their homes to safe havens in
churches and stadiums.
   But last week, there was dancing and drinking on the narrow
sidewalks, and Panamanians waved from their balconies when
authorities knocked down the walls of the general's old
headquarters.
   Men with Atlas beers in their hands stumbled through the
littered room that was Noriega's office looking for souvenirs and
pornography in the piles of debris the U.S. military left behind as
unimportant.
   ``Viva Bush!'' one man shouts.
   Outside, plumes of dust float up to the grey sky in thick puffs,
filling the air with the acrid smell of leftover tear gas. A little
boy quietly throws a pailful of the family garbage into the ruins.
   Broken glass, empty cartons and shreds of paper are piled high:
remnants of the rampant looting that broke out and went unstopped
for four days, emptying businesses of $1 billion of goods and
leaving 30,000 without jobs.
   Television commercials urge viewers to ``Return the stolen
goods.''
   But no one seems to.
   On that sunny afternoon, the new president, Guillermo Endara,
wore a blue suit, puckered his lips and grabbed a sledgehammer.
   ``Over the ashes of the military, we will build a new Panama,''
said the new civilian leader Thursday after smashing a wall of the
imposing building where Noriega commanded his 16,000 forces.
   Scribbled in black ink on white walls, the message ``Yanqui go
home!'' is dated January 1989, because only a year ago Noriega
seemed a winner.
   Next to it, a 1990 thought: ``Free at last!''
   Honking their horns, caravans of cars inch through the capital
past stop lights damaged in the fighting. Members of the new Public
Security force, wearing fatiques and mirrored sunglasses, direct
traffic. They wear no guns.
   It's all a headache for Carlos Busby, who says his tour business
has been hurting since 1987, when Noriega first started acting
bellicose and scared away the visitors.
   ``Nobody really likes an intervention,'' he says. ``But,'' he
adds with a sign, ``there was no choice.''
   A few yards from the Vatican Embassy where Noriega holed up for
10 days before giving up to U.S. troops, a rag doll effigy hangs by
a rope next to a movie poster advertising the new James Bond film,
``License to Kill.''
   On Calle 78-A in the Golf Heights suburb, U.S. soldiers sit in a
shaded booth inside the gates of Noriega's white stucco house, a
discreet and unimposing residence with the name ``Noriega'' written
on the outside in blue Spanish tile.
   ``The house is full,'' remarks one soldier. ``Lots of things in
there I can't afford.''
   Although some have been withdrawn, U.S. soldiers are still
visible everywhere. They ring the foreign embassies where Noriega's
family and friends have sought asylum. To ease the tedium,
Panamanians feed the troops and bring them refreshments.
   ``My first impression is that we're really very well liked,''
muses new U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton.
   At the residence of the Cuban ambassador, a few blocks from
Noriega's house, Noriega's wife, Felicidad, and three daughters are
still hiding, as are uncounted others.
   The U.S. troops won't let anyone in or out of the neighborhood
without proof of residence.
   ``At first people were pretty mad at us,'' said one soldier.
``Now they're used to us. They say, `Hi, Bye. See you later.'''
   For at least the few months, Panamanians must live with the
confusion.
   ``There were no winners. There were no losers,'' said Vice
President Guillermo Ford. ``Just liberty for Panama.''

<HEAD>Keating Blames Regulators for S&amp;L Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lincoln Savings and Loan executive Charles H.
Keating Jr. charges that taxpayers could have been saved half a
trillion dollars in savings and loan losses if regulators had
listened to the five senators for whom he raised campaign money.
   Keating, a central figure in the S&amp;L crisis and the
congressional ethics scandal involving the five senators, on Sunday
blamed regulators for the collapse of Lincoln and hundreds of other
thrifts.
   ``Had they listened to the senators and had they listened to me,
there wouldn't be mess today,'' he said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press'' program. ``I'm convinced that the cost of this debacle is
going to exceed $500 billion. ... Never ... has so much misery and
economic disaster been caused by so few men.''
   Keating defended raising $1.3 million from associates for
political campaigns and related causes of Sens. Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   Edwin Gray, a former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, and federal S&amp;L examiners told a House committee last fall
that they were pressured by the senators in a pair of meetings in
DeConcini's office in 1987 to ease their regulation of Lincoln.
   Since the disclosures of the campaign gifts and the meeting with
regulators, the five senators have tried to disassociate themselves
from Keating. All five are now the subject of a Senate Ethics
Committee inquiry.

<HEAD>Schroeder Doubts Chances for Bill Allowing Women in Combat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder says her bill to allow
female U.S. military personnel into combat probably won't get far
in Congress with most members up for re-election next November.
   ``They want to duck, waffle, tap dance and everything else,''
Schroeder, D-Colo., said of her colleagues Sunday on CBS-TV's
``Face the Nation'' show. ``I think they're terrified to take the
next step because of the emotionalism and irrationality surrounding
the issue.''
   Most members of Congress fear that if they voted to allow women
in combat, opponents would campaign against them as ``the
congressman who voted to put your daughter in combat boots,'' she
said.
   Schroeder, a member of the House Armed Services Committee,
announced after the U.S. invasion of Panama last month she would
introduce the bill when Congress reconvenes Jan. 23.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the same committee in the
Senate, has expressed opposition to changing the current law, which
prohibits the Navy and Air Force from assigning women to combat
ships or planes.
   While the law does not explicitly include the Army, Assistant
Secretary of Defense Christopher Jehn said on the same program
Sunday that the Army takes its ``cue'' from the statute that
Congress doesn't want women in combat.

<HEAD>Powell Says Military Offers Great Opportunities for Blacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The armed forces offer black Americans equal
opportunity ``more so than any other form of endeavor in our
society,'' says Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff.
   Powell, the first black to be named the nation's highest-ranking
uniformed officer, also said Sunday that he does not believe the
all-volunteer U.S. military has become disproportionately black.
   Blacks currently comprise about 21 percent of the armed forces,
compared with about 12 percent of the overall U.S. population.
   Powell was interviewed on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' on the eve of the holiday marking the birthday of the
late Martin Luther King Jr.
   He was asked whether he considers the U.S. military a
``meritocracy'' and equal-opportunity employer.
   Powell replied: ``More so than any other form of endeavor in our
society. I've very proud of what we have done in the military over
the years, and I think for the most part it is a meritocracy. You
are not limited by anything but your own ability.''

<HEAD>Radio Drama On AIDS Produced For Hispanic Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GRANGER, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sergio sleeps with prostitutes and other
men, picks up the AIDS virus, and passes it to his wife and infant
child before dying.
   Victor is married and monogamous. Marco is young and
impressionable, and willing to try anything once.
   The men aren't real. They are characters in a 15-part
Spanish-language drama produced by public radio station KDNA and
being sent to Spanish radio stations across the country.
   Called ``Tres Hombres Sin Fronteras,'' or ``Three Men Without
Borders,'' the serial uses the story of three farmworkers who
journey from a Mexican village to the United States to warn
Hispanics about AIDS.
   The series of five-minute programs, structured like a soap
opera, are intended to educate a population considered at high risk
of getting the deadly disease.
   The $148,000 series was written in Seattle and recorded in Los
Angeles, with technical production at this tiny radio station in an
impoverished farm town of fewer than 2,000 people.
   The drama premiered last month on KDNA, and is running through
the end of January on 15 Spanish-language stations along the border
from San Diego, Calif., to El Paso, Texas, said Rosa Ramon,
promotions director for KDNA. The drama runs for nine weeks. The
stations reach 21 states and some states of Mexico.
   Farmworkers are considered at high risk for AIDS because of
unsafe sexual contacts with prostitutes, who may be intravenous
drug abusers, as well as other men, said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz,
medical director of Seattle's Novela Health Foundation and author
of the script.
   The story is not like a public service announcement, Rabinowitz
said.
   Instead, the non-profit health education organization relied on
studies of farmworkers' actual sexual activities of in creating the
characters and situations, he said.
   Sergio, the careless character, has unprotected sex with
prostitutes, with other men, his mistress and his wife. He ends up
with a long death scene in the final installment.
   Victor goes home from his farm work to a healthy wife and son.
Marco weighs what he has observed in the behavior of his two
friends and learns to protect himself.
   The action and dialogue is graphic.
   ``How much will my little time with you cost?'' Sergio asks one
hooker.
   ``Not too much, and you're going to like it a lot,'' she replies.
   But then she refuses to have sex with Sergio because he won't
use a condom. She does have sex with Marco, who agrees to use one.
   ``Don't miss the next episode of `Three Men Without Borders'
when Sergio confronts another temptation,'' the narrator says.
   Money for the production came from the California Community
Foundation and other groups concerned about getting AIDS
information to farmworkers.
   In addition to the radio show, the station produced several
photo-novellas, booklets that use photographs of actors speaking
with cartoon-like bubbles to tell the same story. Like the soap
operas, this format is being distributed throughout the border
region, Ms. Ramon said.
   The station, which recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, got
involved in AIDS education after one Yakima Valley farmworker died
of the disease, Garcia said. About 17 percent of the area's
residents are Hispanic.
   ``Tres Hombres'' is the station's first major production, said
manager Ricardo Garcia.
   Garcia said there have not been negative comments from listeners
or other radio stations, though he said there was some concern
beforehand that the rough language would raise complaints. An
anthropologist from Los Angeles would conduct surveys along the
border areas to determine how effective the radio program was
spreading its message, he said.
   Garcia said he translated Rabinowitz's script into Spanish, and
played a small part, a paramedic, in the radio drama. Ms. Ramon
played another small part, which she called ``the only virtuous
woman.''

<HEAD>Israel's Strategic Value: Will It Lessen With Soviet-U.S. Thaw?</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Arab Unity, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   As Soviet-American tensions ease, Israel's
value as a strategic ally is being questioned and Israeli officials
are concerned this could lead to cuts in U.S. military aid.
   Mark Heller, a senior analyst at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee
Center for Strategic Studies, says the Soviets are likely to be
less supportive of radical Arab regimes and no longer viewed as a
source of instability.
   ``As the perceived Soviet threat to the Middle East declines, so
may the strategic value of Israel in the eyes of American
policymakers,'' he said.
   A major argument in providing Israel with $1.8 billion a year in
military aid has been its value as a strategic ally, one that could
pre-position equipment, supply the U.S. Sixth Fleet and be counted
on in a showdown.
   ``There is no longer a common adversary,'' said Heller,
suggesting aid cuts could ultimately result.
   More conservative analysts disagree. They suggest Israel may
become an even greater asset if the United States is forced to
close down bases in Europe but wants to retain the ability to
defend its interests against the whims of regimes like those of
Moammar Gadhafi in Libya and the Islamic Republic in Iran.
   ``Expansionist powers in the region could threaten the free flow
of oil and maritime trade routes. These are constant American
interests that will have to be defended even if no Soviet threat is
perceived,'' said Dore Gold, also of the Jaffee Center.
   One sign of continuing U.S. reliance came last week when U.S.
Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz expressed interest in
having access to bases in Israel, according to sources who demanded
anonymity.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who is in Washington this week
for talks with U.S. officials on future military aid, said one
basic element had changed. He said the superpowers no longer fear a
Middle East war would grow into a U.S.-Soviet confrontation as
happened during the 1973 Mideast War.
   The Soviet Union, the main military supplier to Arab states,
threatened to introduce troops to bolster the Arab side during the
1973 war, and U.S. President Richard Nixon put U.S. troops on
nuclear alert.
   ``In the past, many books were written that tried to describe
the Middle East as the focal point from which the Third World War
would start. This fear is over,'' Rabin said in a recent speech to
a conference of visiting Jewish journalists.
   Less worried about a confrontation and tied up with their own
arms negotiations, Rabin said, the Soviets and Americans are not as
eager to tackle intractable regional conflicts like the
Arab-Israeli dispute.
   ``Whenever one or the other of the superpowers will realize that
the gap between the positions of the two sides is too wide, they
tell the two parties `go to hell. You want to quarrel. You want to
use violence. Do it until one of you, or both of you, will become
tired.'''
   Rabin has reportedly set up a task force to study the impact of
U.S. defense cuts on Israel.
   An aide to Finance Minister Shimon Peres said in the past two
years the real value of aid to Israel has declined about 5 percent
because of inflation.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, he suggested the thaw in
Cold War attitudes may be a factor in Washington's decision not to
compensate Israel for the loss.
   ``I will not tell you I don't foresee any new thinking in the
United States,'' said the official, who argued that Israel could
avoid any threatened aid cuts by moving quickly to get involved in
the peace process.
   Sen. Pete Wilson of California, the senior Republican on the
Senate Armed Forces Committee, told reporters during a visit here
last week that Israel remained a strategic ally and said aid should
not be cut because of ``premature euphoria'' over changes in the
Soviet bloc.
   ``I think there are a number of people who are eagerly
anticipating a peace dividend that may not be as large as they
think,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Well-wishers from as far as 260 miles
away came to Rosie's Diner to snap pictures and eat a final meal at
the blue-collar greasy spoon immortalized in television paper towel
commercials.
   Owner Ralph Corrado, sporting a pink carnation, perched on a
counter stool as hundreds of people squeezed through the
glass-bricked entrance.
   And amid clicking cameras and the booming sounds of a New York
City radio station broadcasting live outside, Corrado noted one
difference between television and real life.
   ``You'd go broke if you used paper towels to wipe up every
spill,'' Corrado confided, as he motioned to a dirty dish rag at
the end of the long formica counter.
   Corrado, 57, has been besieged by nostalgia-seekers since
announcing plans to sell the classic 1940s-era eatery. He said he's
been interviewed on radio shows from as far away as Boise, Idaho.
   The diner, which Corrado ran for 30 years, achieved fame between
1970 and 1975, when Procter &amp; Gamble featured it in four
commercials for Bounty paper towels.
   In the ads, actress Nancy Walker portrayed a waitress named
Rosie, who wields ``the quicker picker upper'' against the counter
spills of clumsy truck drivers.
   Corrado eventually renamed the diner, formerly known as the
Farmland Diner, for Rosie.
   Next week, a moving crew will saw the diner in half and hoist it
onto flatbed trucks so it can be transported to Michigan.
   The new owner, Jerry Berta, a ceramic sculptor who bought it for
about $10,000, says he plans to open the restaurant by summer in
his hometown of Rockford.
   But a chapter of diner history ended for hundreds of area
residents who still remember Rosie's.
   Truck driver Joseph Nordlander drove 260 miles from his farm in
Vanetten, N.Y., with his wife, four children, and a family friend
to crowd into a booth for one last meal.
   ``I used to come with my father, who was also a trucker,'' said
Nordlander, 47, as he finished a plate of scrambled eggs.
   ``The shame of it is that all these people didn't come here
before,'' said Livingston accountant Peter Engel. He said that he
and his wife, Helen, ate at Rosie's every Sunday for the two years
they lived in Little Ferry.
   Corrado said business has been off in recent years, largely
because of fast-food restaurants springing up.
   For some saying goodbye, the people who worked at Rosie's were
like members of a family.
   ``I've been coming here since I was 15,'' said Frank Bedacht,
40, of Hackensack, pointing out a sign across the street that once
belonged to a popular drive-in movie theater.
   ``We used to go to the drive-in and drink all night and come
here to sober up.
   ``Oh God, how many nights we used to sit back in the corner and
moan 'til we could see.
   ``But Ralph took care of us. He'd feed us coffee 'til we were
sober then let us go.''

   The paroled child killer accused of
murdering 11 women during the past two years was not even a suspect
until the morning police spotted him sitting in a car near the
frozen body of one of the victims.
   Arthur J. Shawcross fell into the hands of police the ay most
serial killers are caught: after months of grueling investigation _
and a dose of good luck.
   Serial killers often fall prey to their mistakes, said Jack
Levin, a sociology professor at Northeastern University who has
written a book on multiple slayers.
   ``Not because of a multimillion-dollar task force, not because
of the skillful investigative techniques of the police ... but
because of a mistake he made. That is typical.''
   David Berkowitz, New York's ``Son of Sam'' killer, was caught in
1976 after he was ticketed for parking in front of a fire hydrant
during the shooting of one of his six victims.
   Ted Bundy, who eluded police for four years following his escape
from a Colorado prison, was arrested in 1978 after being pulled
over by a Florida policeman for erratic driving.
   Atlanta child killer Wayne Williams was caught when police heard
him dumping the body of one of his victims off a bridge in 1981.
   Randy Kraft, convicted of 16 mutilation-torture murders in
California, was caught in 1983 when police stopped him for drunken
driving and found a body in his car.
   Capt. T. Michael Nault of the King County, Wash., police
department, agrees that investigative muscle alone usually doesn't
solve such cases. Since 1982, King County authorities have hunted
for the Green River killer _ blamed for the deaths of up to 49
young women.
   ``We were told early on ... `You're going to go on an intense,
laborious investigative process and you're going to need some good
luck,''' Nault said.
   ``We've been at it seven years and we haven't had that fortunate
circumstance yet.''
   Investigators said Shawcross' arrest was an unusually quick
resolution to a serial-murder case, one of the most difficult to
crack. Bodies dumped far from the killing site, often not
discovered until long after the slaying, yield little physical
evidence. Sheer volume of cases and lack of a motive also
complicate efforts.
   Rochester police, after concluding in November that they were
dealing with a serial killer, were prepared for a long
investigation. Up to 60 officers were assigned to the case.
   ``Short of some miracle, I would anticipate a very long,
tedious, drawn-out investigation,'' Chief Gordon Urlacher said in
early December.
   Shawcross was one of hundreds of potential suspects identified
by appearance, but not by name, through interviews and surveillance
of an area frequented by prostitutes and their customers.
   Sgt. Roland Marchetti, a police spokesman, said investigators
had received routine information about Shawcross' background when
he was paroled to the area in 1987. Marchetti declined to comment
about how that information was reviewed in an effort to find the
serial killer. In all, there are records of 86 paroled killers in
the Rochester area.
   Edward Elwin, executive director of the state parole division,
said Shawcross would not have been a likely suspect in the killings
because people convicted in sex-related killings of children
generally do not also attack adult women. Shawcross served 15 years
in prison after confessing to killing an 8-year-old girl and a
10-year-old boy.
   Until state troopers conducting a helicopter search spotted
Shawcross in a county park on Jan. 3, the case seemed far from
being solved.
   ``We were just on a search, just going over an area that we had
covered previously,'' said Sgt. Ken R. Hundt, one of the two
pilots. ``As far as I'm concerned, it was just a matter of luck.''
   But without a laborious investigations, police would not have
had the evidence to make a case against Shawcross, said Jim Martin
of the district attorney's office in New Bedford, Mass., where nine
women were found slain in 1988 and 1989. Those slayings are not
solved.
   And it wasn't just luck that allowed Rochester officials to
stumble upon Shawcross that wintry morning, Martin said.
   ``They knew where to look,'' he said. ``They were in the right
place at the right time _ but they had reason to be there.
Certainly, luck may have played a small part, but they did some
darn good police work.''

   The police dispatcher who became a hero for his
10-minute conversation with a frantic, wounded Charles Stuart says
the tragic turn of events indicating Stuart orchestrated the scheme
leaves him saddened and empty.
   But if Charles Stuart called him today, Gary McLaughlin said, he
would coax and plead and try to soothe him through the ordeal again.
   ``The tragic, twisted, bizarre end leaves you with that little
bit of emptiness _ how another human being, or beings, however it
turns out, could do that to a person,'' said McLaughlin, 35.
   But, noting his job as the dispatcher was to get medical
attention to people in need, he said: ``Despite the tragic end, I
would say the mission was a success.''
   Charles Stuart used his cellular car phone to contact police
after he and his pregnant wife, Carol, 30, were shot Oct. 23.
   Carol Stuart, who had just left a childbirth class with her
husband, died of a bullet wound to the head. Her son, Christopher,
who was delivered by Caesarean section, died 17 days later.
   Authorities now say Stuart, who had blamed the shootings on a
black mugger, probably shot his wife and himself and at very least
planned the shootings. Stuart killed himself Jan. 4 as the scheme
was coming to light.
   During the riveting 10-minute conversation, parts of which were
later broadcast on national television, a seriously wounded Stuart
moaned and seemed on the verge of passing out periodically as
police sought to find out where his car was.
   ``Bear with me, Chuck; I'm going to get someone to you,''
McLaughlin told him. ``Hang in with me, now. Just calm down, just
stay with me. I'm going to get help to you. Help is going to be on
the way.''
   ``You can't blank out on me, I need you, man. Chuck? Chuck?''
   Boston officers who got on the line with McLaughlin and Stuart
managed to locate the Stuarts' car by having police cars in the
neighborhood turn on their sirens at different times, listening
through the phone to see which ones sounded closest.
   At the end of the tape, after police reached the car, McLaughlin
is heard saying telling Stuart to give his phone to the officer,
adding, ``I don't want to terminate until someone can hear me. Want
me to terminate, Sarge?'' The tape becomes a jumble of voices, and
Stuart can be heard saying, ``Get my wife out!''
   McLaughlin, an earnest, sober man who uses phrases such as
``negative'' and ``stand by,'' has been a state police dispatcher
for 14 years. He usually fields calls from local police, not
members of the public, but ``911'' calls from mobile phones go
automatically to state police rather than a local department.
   McLaughlin said he had no inkling Stuart's story wasn't genuine.
   ``I never thought for a minute that there was anything
suspicious about (the call), especially when the EMS team got there
and found the people shot,'' he said.
   Stuart never contacted McLaughlin afterward, but the dispatcher
says that's not unsual; he's never heard of a crime victim who did
call back to thank a dispatcher.
   The news that Stuart himself was implicated in the crime did not
make McLaughlin wish he had done differently.
   ``If he called today, nothing would change,'' he said. ``That's
not to convolute it with _ I mean, we don't have ice in our veins.
I don't think anyone in the nation is not deeply saddened by the
bizarre and twisted end.''
   McLaughlin said the call, and the ensuing publicity, was as
arduous as any he had ever handled.
   ``Something that's difficult for a lot of people to understand
is that this is the job we do and that's it,'' McLaughlin said,
although he acknowledged ``as a human being, (the shooting) gives
you a sour feeling.''
   ``I feel like I've become a part of a very bizarre thing.''

<HEAD>Sean Connery's Son to Play Ian Fleming in TV Movie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jason Connery, son of the consummate James Bond,
Sean Connery, is to star in a television movie as Ian Fleming, the
author and creator of Agent 007.
   ``Freud would have a field day with this one,'' Jason Connery
said in this week's People magazine.
   ``The thing is that I'm compared continually to my father _ so I
thought, if it's a good script, just do it,'' he said. ``People
will say what they want to anyway, so I didn't feel any pressure.''
   The younger Connery says his famous father hasn't intruded in
his acting career.
   ``Dad and I have a very good relationship, but when it comes to
acting, it's important to make your own decisions,'' he said.
   The made-for-TV movie, ``The Secret Life of Ian Fleming,'' will
be televised March 5 on the TNT cable network.

   Buyers at the 91st International Housewares
Exposition had their choice of 3 million products, including heated
ice cream scoops, peach-colored light bulbs and skunk-odor remover.
   Any of the 13,000 retailers who had trouble choosing was free to
wander over to the booth displaying tear-apart ``stress dolls,''
designed as an emotional outlet for people angry enough to want to
tear an enemy limb from limb.
   Those who could be happy making hash of mere vegetables were
able to fall back on the old and familiar _ K-tel's Veg-O-Matic,
for instance, which still slices, dices and chops in much the way
it did when it was introduced about 15 years ago before selling
more than 12 million models.
   The four-day show, sponsored by the National Housewares
Manufacturers Association, opened Sunday and is offering 1,900
manufacturers a chance to show off for retailers from more than 60
countries, said spokeswoman Kimberly Rawn.
   ``In four days, they can accomplish what would normally take
months of traveling to the buyers _ to see the merchandise, to talk
about pricing, new packaging, new commmercial ideas, really set up
their merchandising plan for the year,'' she said.
   Visitors include representatives from chains such as K mart,
Sears, Bloomingdale's and Macy's, furniture stores, gourmet shops
and supermarkets, but not the general public, she said.
   Even if the 1990s bring an economic slump, as some analysts
predict, housewares manufacturers expect to keep making profits.
   ``Housewares generally is recession-resistant, because you and I
aren't going to hold off on buying that new toaster if we need it.
We'll hold off on buying the car or the new home, but we're still
going to replenish the items we need,'' Rawn said.
   One item that might not fall into the ``need'' category, but
probably would be affordable regardless of the economy, is the
heated gourmet ice cream scoop, manufactured under the name ``Hot
Dip'' by Robeson Industries Corp. of Mineola, N.Y.
   The battery-operated plastic scoop has a heating element in one
corner of the scooping edge to help it glide through ice cream
without making the frozen dessert melt. It retails for a suggested
$5.99, said marketing manager Carol Dori.
   Philips Lighting Co. of Somerset, N.J., has come up with a
bright idea in home ambience _ 60-watt pastel bulbs _ peach, blue,
ivory, green, pink and yellow _ to give ``just a hint of color,''
said sales director Fred Kellogg.
   For pet owners, Out! International Inc. of Dallas has an answer
to many a malodorous problem, including Out! Skunk Remover, a
shampoo especially made for the dog or cat who has an unfriendly
encounter with a musk-spraying nemesis.
   Americans who are merely up tight may enjoy the tear-apart
stress doll, marketed by Blue Ridge, The Item Co. of Skyland, N.C.
   For $19.95 to $24.95, the foot-tall doll comes in the likeness
of a football referee, baseball umpire, boss, golf duffer, TV hog
and lawyer.
   It has a head and limbs that detach by means of Velcro patches _
for easy and reversible dismemberment.

<HEAD>Older Women Face Greater Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By age 55, women are as likely as men to have
high blood pressure, and more than half of American women that age
have elevated cholesterol levels, the American Heart Association
says.
   In its annual statistical report, the association said Sunday
that by age 65 women are more likely than men to have high blood
pressure.
   The most recent figures show that heart disease and strokes
killed 976,706 Americans in 1987, almost as many as died from all
other causes combined. That amounts to one heart-disease death
every 32 seconds.
   Cancer, by comparison, killed 477,190.
   The statistics were released Sunday at the opening of the
association's annual science writers' forum, where scientists
report on recent heart disease research.
   This year's statistics focus on the risks of heart disease in
women.
   The tally shows that more than half of all women ages 55 to 74
have blood cholesterol levels above 240, at which heart disease
risk increases substantially.
   Only one-third of men in that age group have cholesterol levels
over 240, the association said.
   Men remain more likely than women overall to have heart attacks.
But women have a much higher rate of strokes, which occur when
cholesterol plugs an artery supplying blood to the brain.
   Cigarette smoking seems to pose a greater risk for women than
for men, the figures show. A 55-year-old woman who smokes is in
more danger of a heart attack than a 55-year-old male smoker.
   A 55-year-old woman who smokes and has high blood pressure and
elevated cholesterol has a one-third higher risk of heart attack
than a 55-year-old man with the same risk factors.
   The association estimates that heart disease costs the United
States $94.5 billion a year in medical expenses and lost
productivity.
   The good news is that heart disease continues its gradual
decline. In 1950, the death rate from heart disease was 226 for
every 100,000 people. By 1986, it had fallen to 129 per 100,000.
   Nevertheless, an estimated 67 million Americans _ one in every
four _ have some potentially dangerous form of heart or
blood-vessel disease.
   Heart attacks will strike about 1.5 million Americans this year,
and some 500,000 will suffer from strokes, the association said.

<HEAD>Author of `The Peter Principle' Dies at Age 70</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Laurence J. Peter, whose ``Peter
Principle'' held that bureaucratic problems often occur because
employees routinely are promoted beyond their competence, has died.
He was 70.
   Peter, who suffered from heart trouble and a stroke, died in his
sleep at his Palos Verdes home, his wife, Irene, said Sunday.
   Peter and Raymond Hull wrote the 1969 best-seller, ``The Peter
Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong,'' a satirical chronicle of
incompetence based on Peter's experience with educational and other
bureaucracies.
   According to Peter, every employee in a hierarchy tends to rise
to the level of his or her incompetence. An employee is promoted
from position to position as long as he can do his job to his
superior's satisfaction.
   Eventually, however, the employee is promoted to a job he cannot
do. And there he remains, a meddlesome, obstructive incompetent.
   Peter, a psychologist and professor of education, found such
people in business, schools, government, churches and political
parties.
   ``The cream rises until it sours,'' he wrote.
   Over time, Peter said, every post tends to be occupied by
someone too incompetent to carry out its duties. The only people
who accomplish any useful work are those who have not yet been
promoted to their level of incompetence, he said.
   Peter also described the hazards of ladder-climbing, including
ulcers, alcoholism, allergies and ``Tabulatory Gigantism,'' or an
obsession with getting a bigger desk than one's colleagues.
   After hailing his principle as ``the key to an understanding of
the whole structure of civilization,'' Peter said he only was
kidding. But corporations took him at his word and sent job offers
his way. He turned them down, saying he didn't want to rise to the
level of his own incompetence.
   His book sold 8 million copies, was translated into more than 30
languages and is still available in paperback.
   Hull wrote in the book's introduction:
   ``Dare you read it? Dare you face, in one blinding revelation,
the reason why schools do not bestow wisdom, why governments cannot
maintain order, why courts do not dispense justice, why prosperity
fails to produce happiness, why your utopian plans never generate
utopias?
   ``If you read, you can never regain your present state of
blissful ignorance; you will never again unthinkingly venerate your
superiors or dominate your subordinates. Never! The Peter Principle
once heard, cannot be forgotten.''
   Peter followed ``The Peter Principle'' with eight other books,
including ``The Peter Prescription: How to Make Things Go Right''
in 1972 and ``The Peter Plan: A Proposal for Survival'' in 1975.
   Born Sept. 16, 1919, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Peter
worked in the Canadian school system and became a professor at the
University of British Columbia. He left in 1966 for a post at the
University of Southern California.
   In addition to his wife, Peter is survived by sons John and
Edward, daughters Alice and Margaret and three grandchildren.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately available.

   Guitars are still thrashed and arenas trashed,
but one thing has changed on Motley Crue's latest tour: The heavy
metal bad boys remember what they do.
   ``We only remember bits of past tours,'' lead singer Vince Neil
said in this week's People magazine.
   Booze, drugs, and more drugs left the band members' memories as
fuzzy as their guitar sound, until bassist Nikki Sixx nearly died
of a heroin overdose in 1987.
   The entire Crue checked into a drug rehabilitation program, and
now a drug counselor follows them around on tour to help them stay
on the wagon, the magazine said.
   But concertgoers haven't yet mistaken the group for advocates of
temperance.
   ``We don't just play rock and roll, we live it,'' Sixx said.
``We go on tour and get broken bones, diseases, the crowd leaves
bloody. It's more like going to war.''

<HEAD>Ortega: Opposition Plotting To Withdraw From Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega said early
today that he was concerned the main opposition bloc may withdraw
from the election campaign, and accused it of plotting to create a
``situation like Panama.''
   He said he told U.N. election monitor Eliot Richardson about his
worry that the opposition might pull out of the campaign then call
next month's elections fraudulent, setting the stage for eventual
U.S. military intervention.
   Richardson, representative of U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, refused to confirm whether this had been a topic
of his three-hour meeting with Ortega. The session ended shortly
after midnight.
   This was the first weekend in the campaign that the National
Opposition Union, or UNO, the 14-party bloc challenging the ruling
leftist Sandinista Front, did not have mass rallies. General
elections are set for Feb. 25.
   In Panama's May elections, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega annulled
the results after his candidates were defeated by the opposition
slate. The U.S. invaders who ousted Noriega last month installed as
Panama's new president Guillermo Endara, who had run as the
opposition's standard-bearer in May.
   The Sandinistas have claimed the United States might be planning
an invasion of Nicaragua, a charge American officials have denied.
   Opposition presidential candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,
in the United States after receiving treatment in Houston for a
fractured knee from a fall at her home, was not expected back until
some time this week.
   Her running mate, Virgilio Godoy, had been out of the country
all week and returned Friday.
   The meeting between Ortega, who is running for re-election, and
Richardson was originally scheduled for today but was moved up to
Sunday night and started at 9 p.m. Aides on both sides said there
had been scheduling problems.
   ``The main concern that I expressed has to do with the attitude
of the North American government, with the Contra activity and also
the risk being run should UNO withdraw from the electoral
process,'' Ortega told reporters after his meeting in a hotel room.
   The United States has supported the Contra rebels in their
battle with the government in Managua.
   ``The UNO people have expectations to create a situation like
Panama,'' Ortega said. ``Moreover, I know that UNO leaders have
spoken with U.S. congressmen who have visited Nicaragua.
   ``They're not playing fair,'' Ortega said of the opposition,
``because they're working so as to create in Nicaragua a situation
similar to that of Panama ... and drag the United States into it,''
Ortega said.
   Opposition leaders could not be reached immediately for comment.
   They have repeatedly said they will take part in the elections,
but also accuse the Sandinistas of using unfair tactics ranging
from intimidation to monopolizing the news media.
   Last week, the opposition accused the government of blocking
about $2 million in direct aid for its campaign that the U.S.
Congress approved in October. But over the weekend, Mrs. Chamorro's
newspaper, La Prensa, reported that a government minister had
agreed to release the money.
   Richardson, a former U.S. attorney general, was asked about
Ortega's claim the opposition might withdraw.
   He said he did not want to address the question in his U.N.
capacity ``but as an observer of the American scene.''
   ``I can't imagine the U.S. government exerting any such
pressure,'' Richardson said.

<HEAD>Pravda: Important U.S. Spy Caught and Sentenced to Death</HEAD>

   Authorities have captured and sentenced to death a
diplomat who began spying for the United States nearly 30 years
ago, passing classified information on topics ranging from chemical
arms to politics, Pravda said.
   The Communist Party daily did not identify the man or say
whether he had been executed.
   In its report Sunday, Pravda said the man, code-named
``Donald,'' was one of the most important of about 30 Western spies
caught by the Soviets in recent years. It said he had confessed,
but did not say when he was arrested.
   In today's editions, The New York Times quoted an unidentified
U.S. official in Washington as confirming that an American agent
``from deep within the Soviet bureaucracy'' had been arrested. It
said the American official expressed mild surprise that the Soviets
had made the capture public.
   In Washington, a FBI press duty officer, Greg Jones, told The
Associated Press he had no comment on the Pravda story. CIA
spokesman Bill Devine also refused to comment. ``It's our standard
procedure that we neither confirm nor deny such allegations,''
Devine said.
   The report was apparently intended, at least in part, to enhance
the prestige of a KGB official whose name has been mentioned in
connection with a corruption scandal.
   It reserved a glamorous role for the KGB official, Col.
Alexander S. Dukhanin, who has been criticized by a legislative
commission investigating charges of official corruption extending
all the way to Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev.
   Dukhanin had corruption charges dropped against a former
Moldavian Communist Party official who reportedly may have been the
sole link between Ligachev and Uzbekistan party officials convicted
of taking bribes.
   Ligachev, 70, reportedly the conservative force on the
Politburo, has denied any wrongdoing in the case.
   Pravda claimed that ``Donald'' began spying for the Americans in
November 1961, when he was a high-ranking Soviet representative at
U.N. headquarters in New York. He supposedly met an FBI agent, John
F., in the street after making his acquaintance at a party.
   Information changed hands, and the man the U.S. intelligence
services code-named ``Donald'' was recruited, Pravda said. It said
the Soviet diplomat, with access to classified information on a
broad range of topics, supplied it regularly to the FBI and later
to the CIA.
   ``Donald'' gave the Americans political and economic
information, data on chemical and bacteriological defenses, and
even information about diseases of rice, corn and wheat, Pravda
said.
   Pravda said the purported spy's American contacts had used The
New York Times to pass him messages. It quoted what it said was a
personal ad in the newspaper on Oct. 20, 1964:
   ``Moody-Donald F., please write as you promised.
   Everything is fine with Uncle Charles and sister Clara. They
want you to write to them.
   Don't forget the addresses of Dave, Doug, and their wives.
   Are you planning to travel? When? Where?
   We hope that soon our family will be together again.
   Greetings and best wishes from brother Edward K. and John F.
Kloster, New Jersey.''
   Pravda said that when Soviet investigators broke the codes, the
first line was a reminder about the conditions of making contact
with his American contacts, and the second line expressed their
willingness to work through two unidentified contacts.
   During his career, ``Donald'' worked for the CIA in India, the
newspaper said, where he was allegedly equipped by a U.S. spy with
sophisticated espionage devices that enabled him to send
information from unlikely places, for example a bus as it passed by
the U.S. Embassy.
   While in India, ``Donald'' was warned that the CIA had leaked to
the media a report that a Soviet official at the United Nations had
been recruited as a spy by the Americans in the 1960s, Pravda said.
   The news put the man on his guard, but he failed to notice he
was under heavy surveillance and was caught red-handed in an
unspecified act of espionage, Pravda said.
   He confessed and was sentenced to death, the newspaper said.
   Pravda said ``Donald,'' asked about why he spied, answered: ``I
was so accustomed to walking on a sharp edge that I did not think
of a different life for myself.''
   In its commentary on the case, Pravda says, suggested that he
acted out of ``damaging vanity.''
   ``And he was self-assured, too. He didn't believe that he would
be caught,'' it said.

   For actress Viveca Lindfors, a random slashing
on a Greenwich Village sidewalk has only made her more determined
to fight back in her own way.
   ``It's scary because you don't know who the enemy is any more
and the attacks are random,'' said author Randy Osofsky, one of the
friends with her during early Saturday's attack. ``These are the
things that make you want to move out of the city.''
   But Ms. Lindfors, who was mugged in 1982, said that would be a
mistake.
   ``We all struggle with those thoughts, we all have fear that
says we have to get out of here, but we have to fight back _ you
don't want to be kicked out by kids or rats,'' she said.
   ``This is where we live, me and my children and grandchildren,
and we're not going to be kicked out by those bastards.''
   The slasher and victim said nothing in the attack, which
occurred as she and three friends stood talking in front of an
apartment building.
   ``Suddenly a guy was right in front of me holding my face, and
the next second I was lying on the street. I heard screams, `Get
him!' and I felt the blood,'' she recalled.
   And the next day she was wondering, ``Am I going to be afraid to
walk the streets now? I hate that feeling.''
   Police on Sunday reported no clues about the motive or
identities of the small group of marauding young men believed
responsible for the slashing and one that occurred a few minutes
earlier and a few blocks away.
   Ms. Lindfors and Dennis Beal, 36, were cut on the face by a
member of the gang.
   Despite the ear and facial wound that required 27 stitches the
69-year-old actress was back on stage a few hours later for a
poetry reading. Later, she mixed pity of her attackers with anger.
   ``How do we fight back? How do we struggle against this kind of
thing?'' Ms. Lindfors asked.
   ``I only know one way, and that is to keep on performing what is
of spiritual value to people.
   ``If I could get into schools and read poetry to these kids,
couldn't they turn their passion and that turbulence into the
strong life force, use this life force in a positive way?''
   Even so, she showed compassion for her attacker: ``I'm coming
off easily, compared to him. My ear is cut, but his life is going
to be hell if he doesn't face something within himself.''
   Ms. Lindfors, a classically trained actress who spent eight
years with the Royal Dramatic Theater in her native Sweden, has
performed in scores of plays, films and television shows.
   Her films include ``Night Unto Night,'' in 1948 with Ronald
Reagan, ``Four Men in a Jeep,'' in 1948, ``The Way We Were,'' in
1973, ``Welcome to LA,'' in 1977 and ``Creepshow,'' in 1982.

   Typhoon Koryn, packing
110 mph gusts, knocked down trees and cut electrical power in the
capital of this U.S. commonwealth before moving away today,
authorities said.
   No serious injuries were immediately reported.
   The typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph swept past
Saipan and was moving to the northeast at 8 mph, said Air Force
Maj. Joel Martin, a meteorologist with the Guam-based Joint Typhoon
Warning Center Rapid Response Team.
   As of 4 p.m. (1 a.m. EST), Koryn was 65 miles north of Saipan,
Martin said.
   There were reports of downed trees and power lines before
communications were cut with Saipan, Martin said, but added the
storm's path ``seemed to have spared them a lot of the heavier
winds.''
   Forecasters predicted the typhoon would not affect any other
islands before it lost power.
   The winds damaged power lines, cutting electricity on the island
Sunday night, said Jean-Louis M. Pierrefeu, assistant executive
director for the Commonwealth Utilities Corp.'s power branch.
   As the storm approached, residents boarded up houses, put boats
to sea and moved to shelters, said Civil Defense coordinator Felix
Sasamopo. The airport was closed.
   Conditions on Rota, the most southern of the Marianas, were not
known because of poor communications, Martin said.
   The first island to feel the typhoon was Guam, just to the south
of the Northern Marianas.
   Koryn skirted the U.S. territory to the west Sunday night with
heavy rains and 90 mph gusts, knocking out power and sending more
than 500 people to shelters. Without electricity, the island's
130,000 residents were without water.
   By tonight, electricity had been restored to at least 65 percent
of Guam and 50 percent of the island had running water, said Ben
Reyes, of the Guam Civil Defense.
   Island residents had been warned to keep a three-day supply of
water, Reyes said.
   All of the people who had sought shelter had returned to their
homes except for the 59 members of four families, who were provided
emergency housing, he said.
   Updated reports showed four people suffered minor injuries from
the storm, while the tin roofs of two houses were blown off, Reyes
said.

<HEAD>Supremacists and Their Foes March on King Holiday Weekend</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Unable to keep the Ku Klux Klan
permanently out of town where it was founded, residents say some
good has emerged from the racist group's annual marches against a
holiday for Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``For the first time my community is sitting down and talking
openly about problems that exist,'' said Bob Henry, president of
Giles Countians United, formed to display the community's rejection
of the white supremacist groups that have marched here every Martin
Luther King holiday weekend since 1986.
   ``Pulaski's not a perfect town. We have racism here. We are a
town that recognizes its problems and is moving forward and working
to solve them.''
   Henry's group outmaneuvered the Klan this year, forcing the Klan
to hold its march in a neighboring town. About 300 white
supremacists marched Saturday in Lawrenceburg, while about 300
counterdemonstrators marched in Pulaski.
   But Klan leaders said they would try to return to Pulaski next
year on the weekend of the federal holiday for King, the slain
civil-rights leader who would have turned 61 today.
   The Klan picked Pulaski, a town of 8,000 people about 70 miles
south of Nashville, because it was where the group was founded in
1865. The modern Klan traces its roots to another branch founded in
1915 in Stone Mountain, Ga.
   This year, Henry's group obtained a parade permit first, and the
city won a legal battle in federal court to prohibit marches by
more than one group a day.
   About 200 Klan members or supporters still showed up Saturday
morning for a rally on the steps of the Giles County Courthouse,
and Pulaski police cited Thom Robb, the Klan's national director,
with violating the city's parade ordinance after he held a news
conference.
   Moving to Lawrenceburg, the Klan members were joined by about
another 100 white supremacists. Three people were arrested on
disorderly conduct charges after confronting Klan members,
authorities said.
   Klan officials and supporters accused town leaders of conspiring
to keep them out, and Pulaski officials didn't deny it, saying
they're tired of negative publicity sparked by the racist group.
   Scott Shepherd, head of a group called the National Association
for the Advancement of White People and a candidate for the
Tennessee Legislature from Memphis, promised the Klan would be back
in Pulaski next year.
   ``I understand we can't apply for 160 days prior to the
parade,'' Shepherd said. ``But I can guarantee that on the 160th
day prior to that parade I'll be here at 8 o'clock to apply for a
permit.''

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Sen. Joseph S. Clark, who swept
the old guard out of City Hall and tried to do the same in the
halls of Congress, has died. He was 88.
   Clark died at home Friday, said his wife, Iris. No cause of
death was given.
   Clark is remembered for civil-service reforms during the 1950s
as Philadelphia's first Democratic mayor in 67 years and for his
advocacy of civil-rights and congressional reform in Washington,
D.C.
   A series of speeches he gave in 1963, later published in book
form as ``The Senate Establishment,'' attacked the upper chamber of
Congress as ``a self-perpetuating oligarchy.'' He also wrote
another book, ``Congress: The Sapless Branch.''
   Clark received a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania.
During World War II, he was chief of staff for the Eastern Air
Command in the China-Burma-India theater.
   In 1951, he was elected mayor, ending a corruption-ridden
Republican administration. He replaced the city's spoils system
with civil service regulations.
   Clark said later his major accomplishments as mayor were ``the
reform of the police _ taking them out of politics,'' and ``the
opening of a career service in city government to blacks.''
   ``No public servant has done more for the city than Joe Clark,''
said Mayor W. Wilson Goode.
   Clark made a point of challenging racist traditions. He took
black friends to the Philadelphia Cricket Club near his home _ the
first time in the club's 100-year history that blacks had been
guests.
   ``If I hadn't been made a life member by my father the day I was
born, they probably would have asked for my resignation,'' he said.
   In 1956, Clark was elected to the first of two Senate terms.
   He sponsored the Manpower Development and Training Act and the
Area Redevelopment Act, but was often frustrated by the chamber's
ruling powers.
   ``The Senate establishment is almost the antithesis of
democracy,'' Clark told his Senate colleagues in 1963. ``It is what
might be called a self-perpetuating oligarchy, with only mild
overtones of a plutocracy.''
   James MacGregor Burns, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian,
called Clark's speech ``of historical significance, because it aims
squarely at this century-old coalition as it operates quietly in
the Senate. He has moved the power process out of dim and musty
committee and caucus rooms into the spotlight of the Senate floor.''
   Clark didn't intially support John F. Kennedy's 1960
presidential campaign, but he campaigned hard after the
Massachusetts senator was nominated. Kennedy asked him to draw up a
civil-rights program for his ``New Frontier'' program.
   Clark eventually rose in the Senate, gaining seats on the
Foreign Relations, Labor and Public Welfare and Rules and
Administration committees.
   His relations with President Johnson were cool at best.
   Although he supported Johnson's Vietnam War policy in the 1964
Gulf of Tonkin resolution in the Senate, he broke with the
administration within a year.
   Back home, Clark earned many political enemies in his own party
when he declared during the 1963 primaries: ``It's time to knock
sleazy government out of the box in Western Pennsylvania.''
   When he sought re-election in 1968, local Democratic leaders
failed to work enthusiastically for him and he lost to Republican
Richard Schweiker.
   Clark later spent two years as chairman of World Federalists
U.S.A., a Washington-based that promotes an effective world
government.
   Besides his wife, survivors include a son, daughter, and
stepdaughter.
   A private funeral was held Sunday.

   Pope John Paul II canceled all his
activities today because of the flu, a Vatican spokesman said.
   Monsignor Piero Pennacchini, the deputy Vatican spokesman, gave
no details of the pope's symptoms.
   He said John Paul had been scheduled to receive a number of
visitors, including 50 members of the Chinese National Circus; the
head of the Jesuit order, Peter-Hans Kolvenbach; Louis Sullivan,
the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary; and Cardinal Josef
Tomko, prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of
Peoples.
   The 69-year-old pope himself disclosed he was suffering from the
flu during a visit to a Rome parish on Sunday.
   ``Perhaps you're surprised by the fact that the pope, even
though he's a step away from the children, doesn't hug and kiss
them,'' the pope joked. ``He was about to do so, but then he
thought that he has a virus and since there's enough influenza
going around there isn't reason to add more'' to the contagion.
   A few minutes earlier, as soon as he finished saying Mass, the
pope had a hot beverage and took some medicine to counter fever,
the ANSA news agency reported.
   Asked how high the papal fever was, the pope's doctor, Renato
Buzzonetti, was quoted as telling a reporter: ``I don't know, and
if I did I wouldn't tell you.''
   The flu began hitting Italians in December, starting mainly in
northern Italy and moving down the peninsula to recently grip
Romans, especially children.

   Martin Luther King 3rd, eldest son of the
slain civil-rights leader, said his father would have been
embarrassed by city officials' resistance to a court order to build
more integrated housing.
   ``It is really kind of contradictory that the city officials of
Yonkers would want to celebrate a Martin Luther King holiday and
not try to live out what Martin King was about,'' King said during
a breakfast speech Sunday, the day before the national holiday
celebrating what would have been his father's 61st birthday.
   ``If he were here, I think he would be embarrassed,'' said King,
who was 10 years old when his father was assassinated in 1968.
   ``Do you want to go down in history for doing what was expedient
and popular or for doing what was right?'' King asked the audience
of about 500 city officials and residents.
   The audience was mostly black, but it also included Yonkers'
newly-elected mayor, Henry Spallone.
   Spallone was one of four city council members who defied a
federal judge's ruling that found ``consistent and extreme''
housing segregation and ordered more integrated, low-income housing
built.
   Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned contempt fines for
the council members but did not rule on the judge's discrimination
finding.
   Spallone campaigned for mayor on a pledge to continue the
resistance.
   In an interview after King's speech, Spallone rejected the
implication that Yonkers is a racist city. He said the city has
more low-income housing than any other municipality in Westchester
County.
   But he also said some compromise on housing might be found.
   ``What's great about America is that there is always dialogue
and always common ground to be reached,'' Spallone said.

   James Meredith, whose enrollment as
the first black at the University of Mississippi sparked rioting in
1962, now is fighting white liberals instead of white supremacists.
   ``I was engaged in a war and the only thing that has changed is
the enemy,'' Meredith told reporters Sunday on the eve of the
national holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr.
   ``When we went to Mississippi my enemy was the white
supremacists. My enemy now is the white liberal.''
   His enrollment at Ole Miss resulted in riots that were
suppressed by federal troops. But he since has called integration
``the biggest con job ever pulled on anybody.''
   Meredith said he never considered himself a part of the
civil-rights movement.
   ``That's always been an insult to me,'' he said.
   Meredith blamed many of society's ills on a ``liberal elite,''
which he said wants to keep blacks in a second-class position under
the pretext of helping them.
   Meredith surprised civil-rights activists in September when he
went to work as an adviser to arch-conservative Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.,
   Since Helms' election to the Senate in 1972, he has vigorously
opposed civil-rights legislation and other domestic programs
favored by many blacks.
   Meredith, speaking to reporters before an address at Mount
Holyoke College, had little to say about King or Helms' opposition
to creating of the King holiday.
   ``The issue is not about Martin Luther King's birthday being a
national holiday,'' he said. ``The issue is about the Martin Luther
King holiday commission.''
   Helms has opposed funding for the federal commission Congress
set up to promote the holiday. He says establishing such a
commission for one individual sets a bad precedent.

   David W. MacEachron, who led the Japan Society
for 15 years and advocated close American-Japanese economic
cooperation, has died. He was 66.
   MacEachron died of colon cancer Saturday at his home in the
Westchester County village of Hastings-on-Hudson.
   He was executive director and later president of the non-profit
Japan Society, which promotes understanding between that country
and the United States. He retired in 1989.
   During his tenure, MacEachron boosted the society's endowment by
about $20 million and increased its role in encouraging
cross-cultural friendship through film festivals, stage
performances, art exhibits and conferences.
   Born in Grinnell, Iowa, MacEachron grew up in Oberlin, Ohio, and
Des Moines. He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy at Yale
University and two degrees at Harvard University: a master's in
public administration and a doctorate in economics.
   He also was program director and later vice president of the
Council on Foreign Relations between 1962 and 1974 in New York.
   His wife, Frances, has been mayor of Hastings-on-Hudson for
nearly eight years.
   The Japan Society planned a memorial service Thursday.

   A powerful provincial governor today
threatened to lead a ``people power'' uprising if President Corazon
Aquino's administration removes him for alleged links to last
month's failed coup.
   However, the presidential spokesman said the government was
determined to prosecute the governor, and the speaker of the House
of Representatives demanded that the military take action against
the provincial leader.
   The governor, Rodolfo Aguinaldo, a former lieutenant colonel of
the Philippine Constabulary and one of the most colorful
personalities in Philippine politics, also said he may order his
constituents in Cagayan province to attack ``corrupt'' government
officials.
   ``Where would I go if I am suspended or expelled?'' Aguinaldo
asked in a telephone interview from his office in Tuguegarao, 200
miles northeast of Manila.
   ``I have only my principles. They (government officials) are
harassing me. What will I do? I will fight, fight and fight! That's
it,'' he added.
   Aguinaldo said that if he were removed from office, he would ask
his constituents to stage massive demonstrations like the 1986
``people power'' revolt that swept Mrs. Aquino to the presidency
and ousted the late Ferdinand Marcos.
   ``The people will be enjoined to rise up against the dirty
politicians and the corrupt officials,'' Aguinaldo said. ``Perhaps
the people will stone these officials' houses, bang on their Pajero
(jeeps) and Mercedes, seize their overpriced cement, sort of a
massive people power.''
   Local Government Secretary Luis Santos suspended Aguinaldo from
office last week because the governor allegedly sent troops to
Manila to back the Dec. 1-9 failed putsch, the sixth and bloodiest
bid to topple Mrs. Aquino.
   However, Aguinaldo has refused to vacate his post and filed a
civil suit challenging the suspension order. He also refused to
comment on allegations he helped mutinous soldiers in the December
coup attempt, which left at least 113 people dead and more than 500
wounded.
   Presidential spokesman Adolf Azcuna said the Department of
Justice has issued a subpoena to Aguinaldo asking the governor to
appear at a preliminary investigation hearing on rebellion charges
against him on Jan. 26 in Manila.
   ``This shows that the government, though not as fast as perhaps
our instincts would want us to (move) ... is determined to throw
the book at this recalcitrant local official,'' Azcuna said.
   He said the suspension order was an administrative measure,
while the rebellion charges filed by Santos with the justice
department was a criminal case against Aguinaldo.
   Under Philippine law, a preliminary investigation has to be
undertaken by government prosecutors before a formal case is filed
in a court.
   Also today, House Speaker Ramon Mitra expressed anger at
Aguinaldo's threats and said the military ``must do something
forceful and decisive'' against the governor, who was ``making a
fool out of the government.''
   ``Do they (the military authorities) expect the president to
pick up a gun and enforce her order by herself?'' Mitra said. ``Do
they want the president to go to Cagayan and get Aguinaldo
herself?''
   In his comments, Aguinaldo said, ``This government is bent on
getting me. Very soon there will be action here....''
   He said he may be forced to ``go up the hills,'' a phrase which
locally means becoming a rebel, if he is expelled. But Aguinaldo
said he was confident he would be protected by his people.
   Aguinaldo was implicated but never charged in an August 1987
coup attempt. Afterward, he resigned from the armed forces and
raised a private army, ostensibly to fight Communist rebels. He was
elected governor of Cagayan in January 1988.

   The dollar rose in Europe early today in quiet
trading due to holidays in the United States and Japan. Gold prices
fell.
   Foreign currency dealers in London said violence in some Soviet
republics, particularly Azerbaijan, provided some support for the
dollar over the weekend.
   The U.S. dollar is often seen as a safe haven in times of
political turmoil or international tensions.
   In Frankfurt, dealers said the market has recovered from
Friday's volatility. They said a large buying order late Friday
along with nervousness about Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
stormy visit to Lithuania late last week helped push the dollar up
then.
   Market participants said today the market was turning its
attention to a wave of U.S. economic data due for release later in
the week, particularly November's trade figures on Wednesday.
   Financial markets were closed in Japan today for a national
holiday, and in the United States they were marking the birthday of
the late civil rights leader, Martin Luther King Jr.
   Dollar rates at midmorning in London compared with late Friday:
   _1.6818 West German marks, up from 1.6785
   _1.4954 Swiss francs, up from 1.4940
   _5.7268 French francs, up from 5.7155
   _1.8967 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8870
   _1,255.00 Italian lire, up from 1,252.00
   _1.1566 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1560
   The dollar rose against the British pound, and was quoted at
1.6698 dollars, compared with 1.6705 dollars late Friday.
   The dollar was also quoted at 145.50 yen.
   Gold opened in London at $413 dollars a troy ounce, down from
late Friday's $416.25. At midmorning, the city's major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $415.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $414.90, down from $416.75 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 49 cents to close at a bid
$412.10.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.33 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $5.36.

<TEXT>
   Parliament voted today to abolish the
Communist Party's political monopoly and agreed to discuss further
constitutional changes with the opposition, which is demanding a
swifter transition to democracy.
   Lawmakers voted unanimously to delete clauses in the
constitution that guaranteed Communist supremacy in Bulgaria for 44
years, following the lead of colleagues in East Germany and
Czechoslovakia.
   On Sunday, more than 50,000 people rallied in Sofia to keep up
the pressure on legislators and demand the immediate dismissal of
old guard Communists still in the leadership. They chanted
``Communists resign! Resign!''
   Parliament was also expected to adopt a declaration backing the
restoration of the rights of the Turkish-speaking minority that
arose from talks last week among Communists, opposition figures,
nationalist leaders and ethnic Turks.
   The declaration aims to defuse ethnic tensions between Slavic
nationalists and members of Bulgaria's estimated 1.2 million ethnic
Turks.
   They also adopted a proposal by Andrei Lukanov, the No. 2
official in the Communist Party, to set up the group that is to
join lawmakers and opposition figures in drafting proposed further
constitutional changes.
   The changes are likely to include scrapping the reference to
Bulgaria as a ``Socialist state ... headed by the working class''
and be voted on when Parliament next meets in February.
   The country's new President and party leader, Petar Mladenov, is
under pressure from pro-democracy opposition forces to speed
reforms.
   The demonstrators on Sunday demanded a ``government of national
accord'' and the resignation of Premier Georgi Atanassov, a
holdover from the hard-line rule of Todor Zhivkov, who was ousted
Nov. 10 after 34 years in power.
   Leaders of the pro-democracy opposition Union of Democratic
Forces also read excerpts from a declaration agreed upon Friday by
nationalists, Communists and opposition representatives aimed at
ending ethnic discord.
   Last month, the country's new leaders struck down a Zhivkov
decree under which Turks were forcibly assimilated. Thousands of
ethnic Slavs reacted by taking to the streets in protest and
staging strikes.
   Petko Simeonov, president of the Glasnost and Democracy Club,
has accused orthodox Communists of manipulating nationalist
sentiments in an attempt ``to smash democracy.''
   At Sunday's three-hour rally, opposition leaders announced a
list of demands that include: two-stage legislative elections in
May and November, removing Communist cells from the army, police
and workplace, and scrapping the constitutional guarantees of
Communist supremacy.
   Petar Beron, a leading opposition spokesman who read the demands
from the steps of Alexander Nevski Cathedral, called for some
parliamentary seats held by Zhivkov cronies to be contested in May,
with a full general election in November.
   ``We're hearing of changes in nearby countries like Romania,
even Albania, so we demand democratic guarantees,'' Beron shouted
to the crowd, who sang and cheered in almost a holiday mood.
   He also called for a full report on the finances of the secret
police and the removal of all former Zhivkov collaborators from the
government.
   In explaining the call for two-stage elections, the opposition
movement's president, Zhelio Zhelev, told reporters the opposition
had no time to prepare for full general elections provisionally
slated for May.
   ``We couldn't win full elections in May, but in November we have
a good chance,'' he said.
   ``How can we win elections in May when Department Six (the
secret police) still exists and the mass media are still under
dictatorship?'' asked Ljubomir Sobajiev, another UDF speaker.
   The opposition will demand May elections for 100 to 120
parliamentary seats occupied by ``those compromised under
Zhivkov,'' Zhelev said. The demands were to be presented at talks
with the government that are to begin Tuesday.
   Student leader Emil Koshlukov issued a warning to the
government: ``Czechoslovak students swept away totalitarianism like
an epidemic, and we will also sweep Bulgaria with the `Czechoslovak
flu' this winter.''
   In an apparent response to opposition calls for weeklong
rallies, Parliament President Stanko Todorov called on Sofia's
mayor and police to protect assembly members and ensure ``necessary
conditions for the normal working of Parliament.''
   Todorov's request, in a letter, was read on state television.
   Mladenov, a former foreign minister, has promised democratic
changes, including free elections and freedom of the press.
   But the opposition has criticized him for the slow speed of
reform and for allowing former Zhivkov associates to remain in
high-ranking party positions.
   ``After Nov. 10, our newly-reformed leaders promised to tell us
the real situation _ but we're still waiting,'' said Mihail
Mihailov, one of the 20-plus speakers at the rally.
   Friday's agreement on the ethnic situation confirms a Dec. 29
government decree guaranteeing Turks' rights to reassume their own
names after years of forced assimilation under Zhivkov.
   Nationalists had demanded the decree be revoked, pending a
national referendum, but appeared to be satisfied with Friday's
declaration guaranteeing Bulgaria's territorial integrity and
Bulgarian as the national language.
   Some demonstrators Sunday carried banners that read
``apologize,'' apparently referring to nationalists' accusations
that pro-democracy leaders were ``unpatriotic'' because they
supported the minority rights.

<HEAD>Chinese Reduce Surveillance of U.S. Embassy, But Fang Link Denied</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese police reduced surveillance around the
U.S. Embassy to its lowest level since June, an embassy spokesman
said today, prompting speculation of an accord on a Chinese
dissident who took refuge inside.
   However, embassy spokesman spokesman Sheridan W. Bell moved to
squelch such talk, saying the Chinese gave no reason for their move.
   ``If a secret agreement has been reached, it's a secret to me,''
he said.
   Astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and his wife fled to the embassy in
June when China cracked down on pro-democracy protesters. Since
then, their presence at the embassy has been a major irritant in
U.S.-Chinese relations.
   However, neither side has acknowledged even holding talks on the
Fangs, for whom the Chinese have issued arrest warrants as
``counterrevolutionaries.'' China said last week that the ``only
way out'' for the couple was to plead guilty.
   The Fangs' presence has prompted heavy Chinese surveillance
since June at the main embassy building and at the ambassador's
residence several blocks away. The United States has not said in
which compound the Fangs are living.
   The surveillance peaked in early November, when dozens of
uniformed and plainclothes police watched the compounds' gates, and
their black Mercedes with dark windows and no license plates lined
the blocks.
   The number of police dropped gradually in November but reached a
new low late last week, according to Bell. Today, the main embassy
building was guarded only by five uniformed police with automatic
pistols while three guarded the ambassador's residence.
   Only one police car was sighted in the area _ an unmarked
Mercedes with two men inside that was parked on a sidewalk a block
from the residence.
   ``We have called for (the Chinese) repeatedly in the past to
remove the extra troops, weapons and cars from in front of the
buildings,'' Bell said. ``Now the unmarked cars are no longer
parked in front of the embassy buildings. .... All we know is that
they are gone.''
   Immediately after the Fangs took refuge at the embassy, police
outside began carrying automatic rifles and wearing helmets.
However, they switched back to their usual pistols in November,
when former U.S. President Richard Nixon visited and complained.
   Earlier this month, a China-watching magazine in Hong Kong
reported that Fang would be allowed to leave the embassy and go
into exile in Australia or another country later in January.
   The Chinese-language Pai Shing semi-monthly reported that the
United States and China had reached an ``understanding'' on
resolving the impasse over Fang when U.S. National Security Adviser
Brent Scowcroft visited Beijing in December.
   The Scowcroft trip was denounced by many U.S. lawmakers and
others who believed it too early to resume high-level talks with
China, which Washington suspended after troops killed hundreds of
unarmed civilians June 3-4 in clearing central Beijing of
pro-democracy protesters.
   The critics argued that China had made no corresponding
concession. Pai Shing noted that an agreement on Fang would ease
criticism of President Bush's decision to send his national
security adviser to China.

<HEAD>San Francisco, Denver to Meet in Super Bowl</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The San Francisco 49ers will get their chance to be the first
team in a decade to win two straight NFL championships, while the
Denver Broncos have earned a fourth shot at winning their first
Super Bowl.
   Behind an almost flawless passing performance by Joe Montana,
the 49ers beat the Los Angeles Rams 30-3 for the National Football
Conference championship in San Francisco on Sunday.
   In Denver, the Broncos, led by quarterback John Elway, defeated
the Cleveland Browns 37-21 to win the American Football Conference
title and go on to face the 49ers in New Orleans on Jan 28.
   Montana, who passed for 156 yards in a 21-point second quarter
that broke the game open, had a 20-yard TD pass to Brent Jones and
an 18-yarder to John Taylor, his 30th and 31st in postseason.
   That broke the record of 30 by Pittsburgh's Terry Bradshaw.
Against Denver they will try to match another standard set by
Bradshaw and the Steelers with their fourth Super Bowl victory.
Pittsburgh also was the last team to win two straight Super Bowls,
in 1979 and 1980.
   The Broncos beat the Browns for the third time in an AFC
championship game since 1987 as Elway enjoyed his best game of the
season and his best ever in the playoffs. He completed 20 of 36
passes for 385 yards and three touchdowns, and took Denver on
scoring drives of 82, 80, 80 and 60 yards.
   The Broncos want to avoid tying the Minnesota Vikings' record of
being 0-4 in the Super Bowl. The 49ers are 3-0 in the big game and
have been overwhelming all season.

   Snow blanketed parts of the East today, while unseasonably high
temperatures warmed parts of the Plains.
   Temperatures were in the 30s and snow was falling early today in
Washington, D.C., and Philadephia. Snow also fell today in the
West, in parts of Nevada and Washington state.
   In the Plains, temperatures were above normal Sunday, with
record-breaking highs in the 60s in parts of Kansas and Nebraska.
Highs were in the 70s in the southern Plains.
   The high for the nation Sunday was 79 at Brownsville, Texas.
   More seasonable temperatures prevailed in the East, with
temperatures in the single numbers to teens in northern New England.
   Light sleet or snow was scattered across the Great Lakes region
Sunday, while dry weather prevailed in much of the nation's
midsection and East.
   In California, weekend storms laid out a carpet of snow for
Sierra Nevada skiers. But the weather also was blamed for the
hypothermia death of a 12-year-old boy who was separated from a
church outing Saturday and was found Sunday buried in snow near a
ski resort 45 miles northeast of Los Angeles.
   The storms dumped heavy rain in lower elevations, and thousands
of fans at the National Football Conference championship game in
San Francisco had to trudge through a water-logged and occasionally
muddy parking lot at Candlestick Park.
   A small waterspout, a whirlwind over water, swept across Shelter
Island in San Diego early Sunday, causing an estimated $75,000
damage mostly to beached and anchored boats, authorities said.
   In Las Vegas Sunday, a bus traveling in heavy rain skidded into
concrete barriers on Interstate 15 and tipped over, injured about
30 people, authorities said. Most passengers escaped with minor
cuts and bruises, but one was hospitalized with fractured ribs.

   Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong suffer
beatings by security forces, and many could risk political
persecution when they are forced back to their Communist homeland,
Amnesty International charged today.
   The London-based human rights group urged the Hong Kong
government to stop its forced repatriation program, which began in
December to ease the burden of detaining the refugees.
   ``The fundamental rights of people who face a genuine risk of
persecution are being violated,'' said the report, which was based
on a recent fact-finding mission to Hong Kong.
   The Hong Kong government called the report ``unfounded'' and
said it was committed to its policy of sending the Vietnamese home.
   Amnesty accused the Hong Kong government of mistreating the 51
boat people who were forcibly returned to Vietnam in December.
   It quoted witnesses as saying security forces dragged them from
the Chi Ma Wan detention center in a dawn raid on Oct. 31, using
kicks, beatings and choke holds.
   Hong Kong's Secretary of Security Geoffrey Barnes said ``a
minimum of necessary force was used on that occasion.''
   ``There is no truth whatsoever in the accusation that people at
Chi Ma Wan were ill-treated or rendered unconscious,'' he said in a
statement.
   The refugees were then taken to another detention center, the
Phoenix House. Early Dec. 12, hundreds of security forces in riot
gear brought them to the international airport.
   During that operation, reporters did not see any evidence of
brutality.
   The report also charged the government with quashing
investigations of official misconduct in the camps, citing two
incidents when 200 boat people were allegedly beaten and kicked by
security forces last year. In the High Island Detention Center, it
said, unruly boat people are routinely locked in empty subdivided
cargo containers for several days.
   The report said many Vietnamese feared that if they spoke up
about abuses, they faced ``possible retribution by the police and
risked unfavorable treatment in the screening process.''
   Amnesty criticized the screening process to separate refugees
with the right to find a new country from ``economic migrants,''
who will be forced back to Vietnam.
   Of the 40,000 Vietnamese awaiting screening, an estimated 85
percent face forced repatriation. They make up the bulk of boat
people who arrived after mid-June 1988, when Hong Kong stopped
automatically granting refugee status.
   Under the screening process, boat people are given a hearing
with an immigration officer. They can appeal the decision once.
   As of Tuesday, 7,567 Vietnamese had been refused refugee status,
and 1,889 had lost appeals. So far, 997 have voluntarily returned
to Vietnam.
   Amnesty said that during the screening process, boat people
receive no legal advice and are often interviewed by immigration
officers with scant knowledge of the human rights situation in
Vietnam.
   The report cited one case of an immigration officer who seemed
unaware that Vietnam had once been divided into two countries, a
Communist north and a capitalist south.
   Another case involved a young Vietnamese who was refused refugee
status even though he allegedly was fleeing a five-year term of
``political imprisonment'' in Vietnam.
   An emergency intervention of the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees provided the man refugee status.
   However, Barnes defended the screening process, saying Hong Kong
has given the ``benefit of the doubt'' to many refugees.
   But he said the colony would proceed with forced repatriation.
   ``They have no alternative but to return to Vietnam to restart
their lives,'' he said. ``It would be wrong and cannot be humane to
leave them in detention indefinitely.''
   Vietnam has promised not to prosecute or mistreat the boat
people for fleeing their homeland. But the Amnesty report said it
fears that local officials may persecute those who return.
   Timothy Raison, a British parliamentarian who visited some of
the forcibly repatriated boat people, has said he found no sign of
persecution.

<HEAD>Nations Meet to Set Up Development Bank for Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK McDOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand today opened a
34-nation conference to form an Eastern European development bank
and urged delegates to move quickly to clear that region's path
toward free markets.
   The nations are expected to agree to put at least $12 billion
into the bank in what could become one of the largest regional
assistance programs since the U.S. Marshall Plan that rebuilt
Western Europe after World War II.
   Opening the two-day conference to form the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development in Eastern Europe, Mitterrand
expressed hope the bank could be operating by the spring.
   ``If we don't move fast enough, we risk being passed up by
events,'' he told delegates from both Eastern and Western Europe.
He asked them to move at ``a speed that isn't traditional in
international affairs.''
   Mitterrand proposed the idea of the bank to leaders of the
12-nation European Community in November, and the group of Western
European nations formally approved the concept at last month's
summit in Strasbourg.
   Under that plan, the bank would provide loans, loan guarantees,
economic and technical assistance, and make equity investments in
some projects in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany,
Romania and Bulgaria.
   All those countries are undergoing democratic transformations.
Mitterrand has suggested the loans be tied to progress toward
democratic elections.
   The deficit-plagued United States has given Western Europe the
lead in the plan, saying it is more familiar with the problems of
Eastern Europe.
   The starting point of the talks will be a French proposal that
the EC hold a majority share of 53 percent of the capital. The four
largest countries _ France, Britain, West Germany and Italy _ have
reportedly been asked to hold 8.5 percent each.
   The United States, Japan and Soviet Union would each hold 8.5
percent, as would the European Free Trade Association composed of
Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland.
   Eastern European countries other than the Soviet Union would
hold a total of 6.5 percent. The others shares would be divided
among the remaining nations, including Australia, Canada and New
Zealand.
   Negotiations on the bank could be concluded by the end of March,
EC spokesmen said, but it could take more than a year before
ratification and approval by individual governments on their
contributions.
   A second round of talks is envisioned for Feb. 19.
   Other issues include whether the bank should lend money
significantly below market rates and whether loans should be made
only to the private sector or also to finance public sector
projects.
   The United States and some other countries also have
reservations about whether the Soviet Union should be a borrower as
well as a shareholder.
   Undersecretary of the Treasury David Mulford and Undersecretary
of State for Economic Affairs Robert McCormack are leading the U.S.
delegation to the conference.
   The EC has been coordinating international efforts to aid the
emerging democracies in Poland and Hungary. So far, about $6
billion in food aid, grants, loans and trade have been donated or
committed by 24 industrialized nations.

   An explosive that robbers intended to use
to blast open a safe went off prematurely today, injuring about 30
people during the holdup in a crowded post office, police said.
   The injured were rushed to different hospitals in the central
Italian city. Two were reported in critical condition.
   At least five armed and masked bandits fled in two cars with an
undisclosed amount of cash, a police officer said on condition of
anonymity. One was believed to have been injured in the blast.
   The post office, on the city outskirts, was crowded shortly
after it opened. Many of the customers were lining up for payment
of their pensions.

<HEAD>Jane Fonda's Teen-Age Son Arrested on Graffiti Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troy Hayden, teen-age son of actress Jane
Fonda and her ex-husband Tom Hayden, was arrested early today after
police caught a group of boys spray-painting graffiti at a parking
lot, authorities said.
   ``I can't give out his name since he's a juvenile,'' said Sgt.
Rick Walker. ``He indicates he's the son of Jane Fonda. We've
verified it.''
   The 16-year-old, Ms. Fonda's only son, was arrested about 1:30
a.m. near the San Diego Freeway, Walker said.
   ``He and seven other young gentlemen were applying graffiti to
phone booths and posts at a park-and-ride,'' Walker said. The
sergeant did not know what the graffiti said.
   The boy was booked for investigation of vandalism and breaking a
10 p.m. curfew, both misdemeanor violations.
   A telephone message left before business hours for his parents'
spokesman, Stephen Rivers, was not immediately returned.
   Ms. Fonda and Hayden, a longtime activist and Democratic member
of the state Assembly, dissolved their marriage last year. Although
the settlement was private they announced they would share custody
of their son.
   Ms. Fonda also has a daughter from a previous marriage, Vanessa
Vadim, who was arrested Oct. 6 in New York on charges of
obstructing governmental administration, loitering for the purpose
of purchasing drugs and disorderly conduct.
   Ms. Vadim, 21, was accused of trying to interfere with police
when her boyfriend was being arrested on a drug charge. In
November, a judge ordered her to perform three days of community
service and told that if she stays out of trouble for six months,
the complaint against her will be dismissed.
   Her father is filmmaker Roger Vadim.

   Quake-related calls to suicide hotlines
have dropped to a fraction after three months, but unsettling
reminders of the earth's fury remain. A shopping mall in a seaside
town resembles an abandoned movie set, hundreds of people are still
homeless and major sections of freeways are still closed or
detoured.
   Aftershocks have subsided since the earthquake of 7.1 magnitude
shook Northern California on Oct. 17, but the recovery efforts
expected to take years are apparent as hammering and the hum of
heavy construction equipment fill the air from San Francisco and
downtown Oakland to Watsonville.
   The 15-second temblor injured 2,500 people, killed 67 and left
10,000 homeless; $7 billion damage made it the nation's costliest
quake ever. Almost 70,000 claims have been filed with the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in the San Francisco Bay area for
temporary housing help, home and business loans, grants and other
aid. The American Red Cross says 14,000 families probably will have
received temporary shelter, clothes, blankets, food and other help.
   The eyes of sports fans across the country were on Candlestick
Park and a World Series game between the San Francisco Giants and
the Oakland A's when the quake hit. The ballpark was in the
limelight again this weekend as the 49ers beat the Los Angeles Rams
30-3 to clinch a Super Bowl berth.
   ``Life is not as anxious as it was for anyone, but it isn't the
same for anyone. ... It'll never be the same again,'' said Eve
Meyer, executive director of the San Francisco Suicide Prevention
Hotline, which saw quake-related calls drop from a peak of about
200 a day to the current average two a day.
   ``They say in about six months, it'll be back to normal and
everyone will forget all about it,'' said Erik Carlson, of Mahopac,
N.Y. The quake damaged his spine and left him paralyzed from the
waist down in the wreckage of the collapsed Cypress section of the
Nimitz Freeway in Oakland.
   ``How could I? Look at what it did to my body,'' he said.
   And while Watsonville's Fox Theater marquee wishes passers-by
``Happy New Year'' in English and Spanish, that prospect remains
dubious for many of the estimated 1,000 people left homeless in the
agricultural community 70 miles south of San Francisco.
   Maria Alvarez and her husband slept in a parking lot with their
five children and several other families for four nights after the
quake. Now they have a trailer supplied by the federal government
for 18 months. But after that, she doesn't know if they can afford
to rent a new home.
   ``I've been living here for about 30 years. Now to move
somewhere else, I wouldn't feel right. To start again, it's hard to
do,'' Alvarez said, standing in the 40-trailer Crestview camp, one
of a half-dozen in the Watsonville area.
   ``At least they're secure now,'' said Mayor Todd Mc Farren.
``But they have a lot of fears about what's going to happen in 18
months ... and I don't have an answer for them.''
   Mc Farren expressed concern for the future of the city that
sustained $60 million in damage and lost $400,000 in sales tax and
$200,000 in property tax. ``A lot of workers have left town and the
canneries are concerned they won't come back in the spring ... the
word's out there's no place left to live.''
   The once quaint and tranquil Pacific Garden Mall is the focal
point for damage in neighboring Santa Cruz, 60 miles from San
Francisco near the quake's Loma Prieta epicenter. Today, it
resembles an abandoned movie set or a ghost town. Most of the
buildings _ with broken windows, chipped walls and tilted frames _
are fenced off. Others have been demolished, leaving huge holes.
   Around the mall's fringe are vinyl ``pods'' where 45 businesses
have set up temporary shop, for what may be a two-year stay. One
shop displayed leftover holiday T-shirts proclaiming, ``Yes,
Virginia, there IS a Santa Cruz.''
   In San Francisco's Marina District, near the Golden Gate Bridge,
``For Rent'' signs _ some vouching for the safety of the premises _
fill apartment windows, and vacant lots abound where buildings were
torn down. The Embarcadero Freeway, once a key entrance to the
waterfront and Chinatown, is closed. Its future is uncertain as
officials debate environmental, economic and public safety
implications of its repair.
   A survey by the San Francisco Economic Development Corp. shows
the city's $3.4 billion tourism industry has been hard hit. The
number of spouses coming with conventioneers and the number of
leisure travelers _ who account for half of all visitors from
outside the region _ is down a third from a year ago.
   It's been hard to convince outsiders the city is safe, that
``this isn't Soviet Armenia,'' said San Francisco Visitors and
Convention Bureau spokeswoman Sharon Rooney. ``We've proven we can
rebound from that _ the cable cars were running within 48 hours
after the earthquake.
   ``We're a city probably better prepared than any other city for
an earthquake.''
   Across the bay in Oakland, where the Cypress section of the
Nimitz Freeway crumpled like a paper fan and killed 42 people, all
but a small portion of the roadway has been demolished. A 1\-mile
swath, like a glaring scar, divides the heavily damaged downtown
and a neighborhood ravaged by drug-related violence.
   City Hall has been vacated as authorities consider spending an
estimated $40 million to $50 million for repairs, and a major
department store long vital to a struggling economy faces $8
million to $10 million in renovation bills.
   In addition, Alameda County needs $20 million to keep homeless
shelters open and up to $100 million to repair residential hotels
closed by the quake, said county supervisors' Chairman Don Perata.
   Erik Carlson, for one, will never be convinced of the region's
safety. ``I would come back, but I wouldn't stay long,'' he said
shortly before leaving to return to New York. ``Live in California?
Out! Completely! No way!''

<TEXT>
   About 2,000 people filled the city's main
cathedral today for a one-hour funeral Mass for the 43 people
killed in a discotheque fire, which medical examiners said had
released deadly fumes.
   Medical examiners found fatal levels of carbon monoxide in blood
samples taken from all of the victims of the fire early Sunday,
said Judge Javier Seoane, who is heading up the judicial
investigation in this northeastern city.
   He added the samples had been sent to Madrid for further tests
to determine if other poisonous gases were present.
   The victims apparently died from the hydrocyanic acid as well as
carbon monoxide poisoning, government spokesman Ignacio Bruna said.
Many of the victims died in their seats in the basement lounge.
   Both types of fumes can be given off when carpets, drapes,
furniture coverings and other synthetic material made from certain
compounds come into contact with intense heat, Civil Protection
chief Antonio Herrero said.
   The victims included five members of a band playing in the
lounge and the parents and wife of one of the dead musicians, the
Spanish news agency EFE said.
   A U.S. military base is about 10 miles west of Zaragoza, but the
discotheque was not frequented by U.S. servicemen, and authorities
said all the victims were local residents.
   One woman remained hospitalized with serious injuries, doctors
said. A firefighter and another customer were treated and released.
   The fire began in the Flying discotheque in a run-down section
of Zaragoza, when an electrical overload triggered a short circuit.
It was extinguished in minutes.
   However, toxic smoke poured through air-conditioning ducts to
the basement, where the dance floor, bar and lounge are located,
said a local government representative, Carlos Perez Anadon.
   Investigators found traces of hydrocyanic acid in the lounge,
said Bruna.
   Perez Anadon said the official cause of the fire and the deaths
would not be determined until autopsies were completed, but he
added that hydrocyanic acid is commonly mixed with water in
executions by poisonous gas. The acid is also sometimes used as a
fumigant.
   However, Spanish National Radio said the chemical, used to
produce acrylic fibers, may have been in material for the
discotheque's interior decoration.
   Perez Anadon said records indicated the club's owners had not
used materials with the chemical, which is prohibited by city fire
laws.
   Herrero said about 5 percent of all synthetic fibers, including
acrylics, contain hydrocyanic acid.
   Investigators said they first suspected hydrocyanic acid because
the victims were overcome so quickly.
   ``They didn't make any type of movement to protect themselves,''
said Herrero, who arrived at the discotheque with rescue workers.
   Deputy Mayor Luis Garcia Nieto said firefighters arrived eight
minutes after they received news of the fire, but he said rescue
workers could do little to help those inside.
   ``Several people died in their seats. It was very fast,'' added
Antonio Gonzalez Trivino, mayor of Zaragoza, a provincial capital
200 miles northeast of Madrid.
   Perez Anadon and Gonzalez Trivino both said the disco appeared
to be in compliance with fire laws enacted in December 1983 after a
fire at a Madrid disco killed 79 people.
   It was the second catastrophic fire in Zaragoza in a decade.
More than 70 people died in a July 1979 blaze at the Corona de
Aragon hotel.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. attorney in Miami named a top Justice
Department lawyer and two other veteran prosecutors to handle the
case of Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega and said he never
intended to prosecute it himself.
   Dexter Lehtinen on Saturday named Deputy U.S. Solicitor General
William C. Bryson, a veteran federal attorney from Washington who
played a role in the Oliver North case and government efforts to
restrict abortion, to help lead the team prosecuting Noriega on
drug-trafficking charges.
   Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael Patrick Sullivan and Myles H.
Malman, both longtime Miami prosecutors, also will lead the team.
   Though Lehtinen appeared as co-counsel at Noriega's arraignment,
he said at a news conference, ``There was never a time when I
planned to (prosecute Noriega) or wanted to do it.''
   And Lehtinen it was his decision to remove himself from a direct
role in the case, not Attorney General Richard Thornburgh's.
   Bryson, 44, has been with the Justice Department since 1978 and
was named deputy solicitor general in 1986 after serving as the
chief of the criminal appellate section.
   The former law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall
served as the acting solicitor general last year. During that time,
he wrote the government's Supreme Court brief urging the justices
to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision guaranteeing a
woman's right to an abortion.
   Bryson also was involved in the attorney general's attempt to
keep classified information from leaking out at the Iran-Contra
trial of North.
   Classified information also is a concern in the Noriega case
because of his long association with the Central Intelligence
Agency.
   Bryson will coordinate the briefing and argument of legal issues
in the government's case against Noriega, charged with protecting
cocaine shipments, a drug laboratory in Panama, Colombian cartel
leaders who took refuge in Panama and drug money shipments.
   Sullivan, 42, who Lehtinen named chief prosecutor, is senior
litigation counsel in the Miami office and has been a federal
prosecutor for 18 years. One of his most visible cases was one in
which a ring of officers allegedly stole drug shipments from
dealers to sell for their own profit.
   Malman, 43, No. 3 in Lehtinen's office, has been a prosecutor
for 15 years. He obtained convictions against members of the Cali
cocaine cartel in a Drug Enforcement Administration
money-laundering case known as ``Operation Swordfish.''
   Malman had been handling the drug racketeering indictment up
until Noriega's arrival in the United States on Jan. 4. Five
co-defendants had been taken into custody earlier.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Farmers Strike, Israeli Soldier Stabbed in Jerusalem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Israeli farmers went on strike and
blocked roads with burning tires today to demand the government
ease the debt of collective farms.
   In Jerusalem's Old City, an Arab stabbed an Israeli woman
soldier six times in the back and chest, police said.
   Sixty people were detained for questioning, police spokesman Uzi
Sandori said.
   Israel radio said police were investigating whether the soldier
was wounded with a knife or with a screwdriver found near the site.
   Attacks in Jerusalem have been rare in the 25-month-old
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip. On Sept. 20, a Jewish seminary student was stabbed
in the same area of the Old City.
   In northern Israel, scores of angry farmers used tires and rocks
to close a main road near the Lebanon border, Israel radio reported.
   Police used force to disperse the crowd, and several protesters
were arrested, the radio said. It gave no other details.
   The strike was triggered by mounting farmers' debts and to
commemorate the death of a farmer who committed suicide last week
because of his debts.
   A government-backed program recently was put in place to resolve
the financial problems of kibbutz, which are collective farms. But
the debts of other farming collectives have not been resolved.
   ``We aren't asking for gifts, but we have to be able to make a
living so we can pay off our debts,'' strike organizer and poultry
farmer Avi Krempa said. ``Otherwise our settlements will fall
apart.''
   Krempa said the farmers were staging the one-day action to press
demands for higher government subsidies and increased quotas for
egg and poultry production that would enable the moshavim to pay
off their debts.
   Parliament was scheduled to debate a bill on the issue later
this week, Krempa said.
   Krempa said that 22 of the striking settlements he represents
have accumulated debt of $75 million that they cannot pay off
because their farms are not profitable.

   A blind woman identified a 14-year-old boy as the
person who raped her in her apartment building's laundry room by
smelling his cologne and touching his hands, police said.
   The 24-year-old woman, legally blind for three years,
immediately recognized the scent of the suspect's cologne and later
felt his hands in a lineup at a police station, investigators said.
The assailant held his hands over the victim's mouth during the
attack.
   ``It was the smell of his cologne,'' the woman said Sunday.
``That was the major key. I could tell, too, by the size of his
hands and how rough or smooth they were.''
   The boy accused in the rape lives in the victim's apartment
building, and on the same floor. Police knocked on his door during
their investigation and the victim, who accompanied the
investigators, got a whiff of his cologne.
   ``A lot of people can't even give a good description of a
rapist,'' said police Detective Catherine Fitzgibbon. ``Yet this
woman was able to pick him out by his touch and smell. It was
remarkable.
   ``I've never heard of a blind woman being able to pick someone
out of a lineup,'' Fitzgibbon said.
   Another officer, however, cautioned that such identifications
might not be admissible in court.
   ``The sense of smell and feel,'' said Detective Karl Kurth. ``Is
that enough to stand in a court of law? I don't know.''
   The woman said she was in her building's laundry room folding
her towels when the assailant came up from behind, shoved her in a
corner and raped her.
   The suspect was named in a juvenile petition and was held at a
youth home. He was scheduled to appear Tuesday in Juvenile Court to
determine whether he would remain in custody and whether he would
stand trial as an adult.

<HEAD>Gordon Jackson, Star of `Upstairs, Downstairs,' Dead at 66</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY24</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Gordon Jackson, who played the butler in
``Upstairs, Downstairs'' and brought his mellifluous Scots accent
to dozens of films, stage and television roles, has died, his agent
said today. He was 66.
   Jackson died Sunday in London's Cromwell Hospital with his wife,
Rona, at his side, Michael Anderson said. The cause of death was
not disclosed, but Anderson said Jackson had been ill for a short
time.
   The tall, ginger-haired Jackson started acting as a teen-ager
soon after the outbreak of World War II. His rueful expression
first typecast him as a coward and a weakling, although maturity
brought him a greater variety of roles.
   His acting career spanned nearly half a century and included
more than 60 film credits, but he was best known for his role as
the stiff-upper-lipped butler Hudson in the internationally
successful television series ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' from 1970 to
1975.
   He won a British Actor of the Year award in 1974 for the series,
reruns of which are still being shown in the United States.
   Jackson, described as gentle and self-effacing by friends, once
said: ``My trouble is that I'm underconfident and I'm too
tentative. I'm not a go-getter and I never have been.
   ``It's only when the curtain goes up and the cameras start to
roll that I don't enjoy this business.''
   Jackson was born in Glasgow in 1923. He started an
apprenticeship with Rolls Royce in Edinburgh, but got his first
professional acting job as in 1941, playing a Scottish soldier in
the film ``The Foreman Went to France,'' a story of Britons trapped
in France in 1940 by the German invasion.
   His film credits included ``Whisky Galore'' in 1948, ``Mutiny on
the Bounty'' in 1961, `The Great Escape'' in 1962, ``The Prime of
Miss Jean Brodie'' in 1968 and ``The Whistle Blower'' in 1986.
   He also played the tough undercover police chief Cowley in the
British TV thriller series ``The Professionals'' from 1977 to 1981,
and was in the 1988 TV movie ``Noble House.''
   On stage, he was Shakespeare's Banquo in ``Macbeth,'' Horatio in
``Hamlet,'' Mavolio in ``Twelfth Night'' and a host of other
characters in London's West End.
   ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' co-star John Alderton recalled Jackson
as ``the sweetest, gentlest man I have ever met. To have worked
with him was a privilege, to be counted as a friend was an honor.
His unparalleled contribution to film and television for over 50
years will remain a testament to his very special talent.''
   Jackson is survived by his wife, Rona, also an actress, and two
sons. Funeral plans have not been made.

<HEAD>U.N. Security Council Group Meets to Discuss Cambodian Peace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council met today to discuss what many see as the best chance in
years to end the Cambodian civil war.
   The closed-door meeting followed reports that Khmer Rouge
guerrillas had taken territory from Cambodia's Vietnamese-backed
government and attacked the country's two largest cities.
   The Khmer Rouge radio reported today that thousands of people
fled the western city of Battambang following a guerrilla attack
Jan. 5. The report could not be confirmed.
   Representatives from Britain, China, France, the United States
and the Soviet Union began talks this morning. Diplomatic sources
said it was unlikely a statement on the progress of the talks would
be issued before the meeting ends Tuesday.
   The Foreign Ministry issued a statement as the talks began
urging the diplomats to find ``a solution to allow an end to the
murderous conflict tearing apart Cambodia that prevents a return to
power by the Khmer Rouge.''
   About a dozen supporters of the non-Communist resistance in
Cambodia gathered outside the International Conference Center to
protest the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese-installed government in
Phnom Penh.
   ``The people of Cambodia cannot and the free world should not
resign themselves to an alternative between two despotisms,'' said
a statement signed by 41 French parliamentarians supporting the
protesters.
   Hundreds of thousands of people died during the Communist Khmer
Rouge's 3{-year grip on power, which ended when Vietnam invaded
Cambodia in late 1978. Since September, when Vietnam said it
withdrew the last of its troops from Cambodia, concern has risen
that the Khmer Rouge would again seize power.
   The Security Council delegates likely will focus on an
Australian proposal for an interim U.N. administration to run
Cambodia until free elections can be held.
   Cambodia's disputed seat in the United Nations, held by the
three-party guerrilla alliance since 1982, would be left vacant
until a new government is elected.
   The plan received a boost Friday after a Soviet deputy foreign
minister, Igor Rogachev, announced the Soviet Union and China have
agreed the United Nations should play ``a very major role'' in a
settlement.
   The announcement holds promise for the talks since the Soviets
arm the Communist government of Prime Minister Hun Sen and China
arms the Khmer Rouge, the strongest rebel group.
   France, Britain, and the United States have reacted favorably to
the Australian plan. Vietnam and Phnom Penh have lent conditional
support. So has Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of the alliance,
and former Prime Minister Son Sann, head of its smallest faction.

   About 1.8 million 20-year-olds officially became
adults today in ceremonies commemorating Coming of Age Day, a
national holiday.
   Women dressed in beautiful pink and gold Japanese kimonos, and
men in Western suits filled the streets of Tokyo, in keeping with a
custom in which young people are given new clothes upon reaching
maturity.
   But instead of heading for ancient temples to be confirmed as
adults in religious or cultural rites, the young people went to
municipal offices where mayors presided over brief ceremonies and
urged them to be good citizens.
   Coming of Age Day has little meaning as a rite of passage for
many contemporary Japanese youth, however.
   At 20 years old they gain the legal right to drink, smoke and
vote for the first time. But many young Japanese and been drinking
and smoking for years, and many 20-year-old do not even attend the
event.
   Ritsuko Hagiwara, a university student in Tokyo, wrote the
leading newspaper Asahi Shimbun that she decided not to participate
in the holiday and would use money from her parents intended for a
new kimono instead for a trip abroad with friends.
   ``Although I was attracted by the gorgeous invitation (sent by
the city government), I've begun to have doubts about the whole
thing. Coming-of-Age Day was originally supposed to celebrate
becoming an adult and afterward one was supposed to be able to live
independently. ... But I'm still a student, and will have to be
taken care of by my parents for the next three years,'' she wrote.

   Charles Stuart's crime went far beyond the murder
of his pregnant wife, rushing an undercurrent of racial tensions to
the surface that spread fresh dirt on a city often portrayed as an
educational and cultural center.
   ``It became a crime story that played nationally because it fit
so neatly with our national tragedy of racial discord,'' said Mayor
Raymond L. Flynn. ``The ... most evil thing about this awful fraud
was that it hurt the heart and the soul of a city that has worked
so hard to break down the racial barriers that for years divided
it.''
   The bullet that killed Carol Stuart touched everyone for the
worst, including the state of Massachusetts and its governor,
Michael S. Dukakis, who have been the butt of daily ridicule for
big spending, taxes, low bond ratings and the falling star of the
``Massachusetts Miracle'' economy.
   But this time, public anger, mostly from blacks, was directed at
Flynn and Boston police. It was the mayor who ordered a giant
dragnet in the Mission Hill neighborhood after Stuart told
authorities that a black gunman forced his way into the white
couple's car as they left a hospital birthing class Oct. 23, then
robbed and shot them.
   Stuart's desperate pleas over his car phone that guided police
to the couple were later broadcast and published nationally along
with photos of him and his mortally wounded wife bloodied in their
car.
   The grim images exacerbated white fears of a crime-ridden city
where in the two months before there had been nearly 200 shootings
in neighborhoods where large numbers of blacks live.
   Before Mrs. Stuart's murder, police had been fanning through the
neighborhoods frisking black men in efforts to halt the crime
spree. Then, with the city outraged over the murder of Mrs. Stuart,
blacks said police were out of control, violating their
constitutional rights and trying to intimidate them.
   As it turned out, Stuart's story was the big lie. When police
started to close in on him after a brother, Matthew, fingered him,
Stuart leaped off a bridge Jan. 4. His suicide cleared a black man
who had been labeled by police sources as the prime suspect,
William Bennett, a 39-year-old ex-convict with a record of 60
arrests, including jail time for shooting a policeman.
   The city's image was further tainted as black witnesses charged
that police had manipulated evidence and put words in their mouths
that pinned the crime on Bennett.
   Flynn, a potential Democratic gubernatorial candidate this year,
was so concerned about Boston's image as well as his own that he
devoted nearly half his annual State of the City speech last
Wednesday to the Stuart case.
   ``When I ordered an aggressive police reponse ... I wanted to
send a strong signal _ as strong as I could _ to show the city's
outrage, and to show that we would not tolerate such an act,'' he
said.
   Boston was branded a racist city 15 years ago when forced busing
to integrate city schools erupted in violence. ``Just as today, the
stereotype was accepted,'' said Flynn, who as a city councilor
during the 1970s helped lead the opposition to busing.
   What seemed to gall whites more than anything was that Stuart
was able to pull off the hoax.
   ``I'm embarrassed what it did to the city,'' said Jeanine
Fowler, a 34-year-old bartender at the Bull and Finch Pub, a
tourist spot on which the bar in the TV show ``Cheers'' is modeled.
``He took advantage of our prejudices that we all do have. People
say Boston is supposed to be such an educated city and cultural
center, and then this happens and that makes us preying on the
black community. And he (Stuart) created this all himself.''
   On the Thursday that Stuart committed suicide, news of his
plunge into Boston Harbor was all over the television in the Bull
and Finch. While the local customers and the help were watching for
every new detail, most of the tourists were more interested in
seeing the city's sights.
   Ashley McCown, a marketing associate for the Massachusetts
Office of Travel and Tourism, said there is no way to judge how the
Stuart case might affect the more than $8 billion tourism business
in the state.
   But Bob Cumings, president of the Greater Boston Convention and
Visitors Bureau, said he had just returned from major industry
meetings in New Orleans and there was no indication anyone was
considering scratching Boston.

   The new government today promised to
consult all opposition parties on the timing of elections this year
but said it would make the final decision on the balloting.
   Trials were scheduled to begin today for members of the Nicolae
Ceasescu's hated Securitate secret police in Timisoara, police
said. Protests in the western city ignited a popular revolution
last month that toppled the Communist dictator.
   Other trials for Ceausescu colleagues, including one of his
sons, will begin this week on charges of aiding genocide and
bringing on economic ruin, state television reported. Ceausescu and
his wife, Elena, were found guilty of such charges and executed
Dec. 25.
   Dragos Munteanu, a spokesman for the governing National
Salvation Front, said no decision has yet been made to delay the
scheduled April parliamentary vote, despite opposition parties'
demands for more time to organize their compaigns.
   He said the government would consult the opposition parties and
delay the elections ``if the political forces are for it.'' But he
added that he favors holding the vote as soon as possible.
   Munteanu said the hasty decision to outlaw the Communist Party
Friday night, a move that the provisional government overturned
Saturday in favor of submitting the issue to national referendum,
showed the need for quick elections.
   The questions of banning the party and capital punishment will
be submitted to a national referendum Jan. 28.
   Calling the party ban a mistake made of inexperience, Munteanu
said, ``This is one of the reasons to have the elections as soon as
possible, to have a legal government, a parliament.''
   Romanians still have to learn the principles of democracy, he
said.
   ``When I speak about learning democracy, even the government has
to learn it,'' he said. ``We don't have real statesmen and
politicians. They have to learn it.''
   In its report Sunday, state television showed Valentin
Ceausescu, a son of the deposed dictator; former Communist Party
Secretary Emil Bobu; former Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu;
Marin Neagoe, who directed personal security for Ceausescu; and
Dimitru Popescu, former director of the Sociopolitical Academy.
   The five are being investigated for abetting genocide and
sabotaging the economy, which was squeezed dry by Ceausescu's
payoff of Romania's foreign debt of more than $10 billion between
1982 and 1989, Romanian television said.
   Interim Foreign Minister Sergiu Celac told reporters that
Romania's economy is in ``almost complete ruin'' and that the
country needs massive food imports to feed its 23 million people.
   The genocide allegation refers to the thousands killed during
December's popular uprising _ during which Securitate units fought
army troops and civilian revolutionaries _ as well as victims of
political repression during Ceausescu's 24-year reign.
   The exact charges to be levied at the trial have not been
disclosed.
   Valentin, Ceausescu's eldest son, was a member of the Communist
Party's policy-setting Central Committee. Bobu was Ceausescu's
closest associate in running Romania after the dictator's wife,
Elena.
   Ceausescu's youngest son, Nicu, and his daughter Zoya were
arrested soon after he was overthrown. But they were not shown on
television over the weekend.
   There was no indication exactly when or where the trials would
take place, but interim President Ion Iliescu told a mass rally
Friday that the trials would be public and televised.

<HEAD>DEA Kept Close Ties to Noriega Before Indictment, Report Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs of former DEA chief's quotes after 5th graf,
Quiel also</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   While federal prosecutors were moving to
indict Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega on narcotics charges, the
Drug Enforcement Administration was maintaining close ties with him
and offering praise for his cooperation in the war against drugs, a
congressional report shows.
   ``The DEA has long welcomed our close association and we stand
ready to proceed jointly against international drug traffickers
whenever the opportunity arises,'' drug enforcement administrator
Jack Lawn wrote to Noriega less than a year before the indictment
was entered in federal court in Miami in February 1988.
   Lawn had special praise for the work of Luis Quiel, Noriega's
liaison to the DEA, as ``integral to the success of fighting
international drug trafficking.''
   But according to the final report of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on narcotics, issued in December 1988, Quiel
was also Noriega's liaison to the Medellin drug cartel and ``thus
in a position to alert the drug traffickers to whatever information
the DEA had provided him.''
   Quiel also acted ``as Noriega's enforcer to eliminate
competitors of the Medellin cartel by turning them over to the
United States,'' the panel said.
   Lawn's predecessor as DEA administrator, Francis M. Mullen, told
The Day newspaper of New London, Conn., last week that he had been
surprised by Noriega's indictment because ``he was our fair-haired
boy down there.''
   ``Whenever we'd ask him for help, he'd always give it to us,''
said Mullen, who left DEA in 1985.
   The report, issued in December 1988 after a three-year
investigation, paints a vivid portrait of Noriega and his
involvement with drugs, money laundering, gun running and other
illegal activities over his 20-year rise to power as Panama's
military strongman.
   The first links between Panamanian officials and narcotics
traffickers were forged while Gen. Omar Torrijos ruled Panama, the
report said.
   But after Torrijos died in an airplane crash in 1981, Noriega
took charge of the country's most important institutions, using
them to generate revenue for officers of the new Panamanian Defense
Force and to exercise control over the drug traffic.
   Before he was ousted last month by the U.S. invasion of his
country, Noriega controlled the customs, immigration and passport
services, civil aeronautics, the National Bank of Panama and the
attorney general's office. He pushed legislation through the
national assembly consolidating the National Guard, navy, police
and customs into a unified Panamanian Defense Force under his
command.
   ``As head of the PDF, Noriega now controlled all elements of the
Panamanian government essential to the protection of drug
trafficking and money laundering, increasing his control over
Panama and enriching himself,'' the panel said.
   One witness, Ramon Milian Rodriguez, a Miami-based, Cuban-born
accountant, testified he negotiated an agreement with Noriega in
1979 on behalf of the Medellin cartel which gave Noriega a
commission to provide security and handling for drug money arriving
in Panama to be laundered through its banking system.
   PDF soldiers met planes ferrying billions of dollars in cash
from Miami, guarded the money as it was loaded into armored cars
and delivered it to the Banco Nacionale de Panama, according to the
subcommittee.
   Milian Rodriguez said Noriega eliminated him as a middleman in
1983 by arranging to have information about his money laundering
operation passed on to the DEA. The tip resulted in his arrest and
eventual prison sentence.
   The panel said it had evidence to corroborate Milian Rodriguez'
story that Noriega's cronies then took control of the money
laundering business.
   Soon Noriega's associates began to smuggle narcotics themselves
using light planes, the panel said. But in 1984, Noriega's
interests clashed with those of the Medellin cartel.
   Noriega, the panel said, had permitted the cartel to establish
cocaine processing plants in Panama, including one at La Palma in
Darien Province near the Colombian border.
   It alleged that Noriega accepted $5 million from the drug cartel
to protect the facility.
   But in mid-May 1984, concerned about pressure from the DEA,
Noriega ordered his soldiers to raid the plant and arrest its
employees.
   Feeling betrayed, the cartel's leaders ordered Noriega's
assassination, the panel said, quoting a Noriega associate, former
Panamanian intelligence official Jose Blandon.
   Blandon testified that Noriega turned to Cuban Premier Fidel
Castro, and accepted Castro's recommendation that he return the $5
million and the plant machinery and release the 23 persons who had
been arrested.
   U.S. law enforcement agencies continued to view Noriega as a
friend of the United States, the subcommittee said.
   Lawn, the DEA administrator, wrote Noriega on May 8, 1986,
stating the DEA's ``appreciation for the vigorous anti-drug
trafficking policy that you have adopted which is reflected in the
numerous expulsions from Panama of accused traffickers...''
   The subcommittee noted Lawn's testimony that Noriega was
actively cooperating in such areas as crop eradication, narcotics
investigations, money laundering and drug interdiction.
   Because the DEA shared information with the Panamanian
government, drug dealers linked to Noriega were advised whether or
not their planes were on a DEA watch list, the report said, quoting
witnesses.
   Francis McNeil, former U.S. ambassador to Costa Rica, told the
panel that while law enforcement and intelligence agencies worked
closely with Noriega, the State Department did not trust him.
   In June 1986, he said, a State Department investigation
concluded that Noriega was corrupt but there was no clear evidence
that he was involved with narcotics.

   Lithuania's Communist Party chief was
overwhelmingly elected the republic's president today in a clear
endorsement of his defiant stand toward Moscow and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Algirdas Brazauskas was elected 228-4, with 19 abstentions, by
the republic's Supreme Soviet legislature, the Tass news agency
reported.
   The republic's Supreme Soviet also voted to limit voting rights
for military personnel, requiring them to have lived in Lithuania
for at least 10 years, said Eduardas Potasinskas, a journalist for
Lithuanian TV. The measure in effect restricts voting in local
elections Feb. 24 to servicemen from Lithuania or a few
long-serving soldiers and sailors.
   Brazauskas, 57, faced alternative candidates: national
legislator Kazimeras Motieka and Romualdas Ozolas, a leader of the
pro-independence group Sajudis.
   Potasinskas said the vote will ``strengthen the position of
Brazauskas in dealing with Moscow.''
   Brazauskas backed the Lithuanian party's decision Dec. 20 to
break away from the national Communist Part, the first such break
since the Communists took over in Moscow in 1917.
   Gorbachev, who had denounced the move, visited Lithuania from
Thursday through Saturday to try to persuade Lithuanian Communists
to reverse their decision.
   The Lithuanians refused to budge and Gorbachev failed to end the
schism. He concluded his visit Saturday by saying he saw ``no
tragedy'' in a multiparty system _ a change from his previous
unconditional call for a one-party system.
   Gorbachev pleaded for unity repeatedly but was confronted by
pro-independence demonstrators at many stops. Public opinion
strongly supports independence for the Baltic republic of 3.7
million, which was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Brazauskas has been the Lithuanian party's first secretary since
Oct. 20, 1988. His new title, the equivalent of president, is
chairman of the Presidium of the republic's Supreme Soviet. He
takes over from Vytautas Astrauskas, who resigned.
   Astrauskas, 59, had served as the republic's president since
December 1987. He was regarded by Lithuanian activists as a
conservative, but not a vehement opponent of the independence drive.
   There was no discussion at the Supreme Soviet of how many people
the voting restrictions would affect, and the Soviet Union does not
publicize the number of military personnel stationed in its
republics.
   Lithuanian progressives feared their favored candidates would
not fare as well as they could if the servicemen were allowed to
vote. But the national government has struck down similar attempts
to restrict voting rights in other republics.

<HEAD>Thousands Protest Cuts In Train Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people demonstrated across Canada to
protest massive reductions in passenger rail service, which left
some communities without train stops today.
   Two people were killed in a train-truck collision Sunday on the
final daily run of the Canadian, the famous transcontinental, and
the last passenger train run from Sydney in Nova Scotia to Halifax
was canceled because protesters padlocked themselves to the
locomotive.
   As of today, the transcontinental run known for its scenic views
is being changed to a different route and reduced to three times a
week.
   As cries of ``All aboard!'' were heard Sunday for the last time
in some towns, Via Rail passengers and employees directed their
rage at the federal government, which decided in October to cut
Via's subsidies to $350 million by 1992 from $640 million in 1988.
   Under the cuts, 17 of Via's 38 routes were eliminated, as were
2,700 jobs _ 38 percent of the workforce. The service reductions
went into effect today after a federal court ruled Friday that a
formal environmental review was not needed.
   ``I think it's wrong _ it's going to hurt national unity,''
Julia Conley, 64, told about 450 people at Toronto's Union Station
in a voice quavering with emotion.
   Sunday's protests attracted hundreds of people in cities such as
Halifax, Ottawa and Toronto.
   Two people were killed when the Canadian collided with a pickup
truck at a crossing in a residential area near Pembroke, Ontario,
about 60 miles west of Ottawa, police said. The train continued on
its run from Montreal to Vancouver.
   ``It's quite a way to end it all,'' said conductor Don Green,
who is retiring after 34 years. ``I haven't seen something like
this in 15 or 20 years.''

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan
today assured President Wojciech Jaruzelski of further economic
support for Poland as economic experts discussed terms of promised
Japanese credit guarantees.
   Kaifu also met with with non-Communist Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki and the leaders of both chambers of Parliament on the
final day of his two-day visit.
   He is scheduled to travel to Hungary later today to wrap up his
seven- country tour of Europe.
   The state news agency PAP said Kaifu told Jaruzelski that Japan
would increase its support for the changes under way in Poland,
particularly in financial cooperation.
   Poland and Japan signed an agreement Sunday in which Tokyo
pledged a $150 million credit to a stabilization fund to back the
zloty as it becomes a convertible currency.
   Japan also agreed to provide Poland with $25 million in food
aid, and $15 million to help train Polish managers.
   The two countries also discussed a possible $350 million
guarantee for government investments and a $500 million guarantee
by the Japanese Export-Import Bank for Japanese investments in
Poland.
   Poland is also hoping for Japanese support during negotiations
on Poland's $40 billion foreign debt.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake shook eastern Taiwan
today but there were no immediate reports of casualties or serious
damage.
   The quake, which measured a preliminary 5.8 on the Richter scale
of ground motion, struck at 8:42 p.m., the Central Weather Bureau
said. The epicenter was about 20 miles north of Hualien, a city in
eastern Taiwan 75 south of Taipei.
   The quake was felt in Taipei, where residents reported that it
shook furniture.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake registering 6 on the scale can cause severe damage
in a populated area.

   Columbia's astronauts settled into a
day of medical and science experiments today after their sleep was
interrupted by an alarm signaling a brief problem with a navigation
system.
   The five phantom signals that triggered the buzzing alarm posed
no threat to the mission, and the five crew members went back to
bed. After waking at the normal time, commander Dan Brandenstein
successfully tested the system and brought it back on line.
   Mission Control reported the fleeting signals were in a
speed-measuring accelerometer that is part of what's known as an
Inertial Measurement Unit, a key component of the shuttle's
guidance system.
   When the alarm sounded in the cabin as the astronauts slept,
Brandenstein woke up and asked the control center if there were
anything he could do.
   Controllers told him the spaceship computer had shifted
automatically to a second IMU, that everything was OK and to go
back to sleep.
   There are three such devices aboard. Only one is needed for a
safe flight, but flight rules dictate that if one failed, Mission
Control would consider bringing the astronauts home as soon as
possible because of the possibility of a common problem in all
three units.
   When the astronauts were wakened at the regular time two hours
after the alarm, they were told that scientists on the ground had
monitored the suspect unit and had detected no further problems.
Brandenstein was told to put it back in operation and realign it by
aiming at two stars.
   ``The crew successfully did some celestial navigation,'' said
Mission Control commentator Brian Welch. ``We just got word that
all looks good. IMUs 1, 2 and 3 are all chugging along in good
shape.''
   Flight director Al Pennington said that five transient signals
were received in a 10-minute program, each indicating either a lack
of acceleration or a minus acceleration.
   The problem may not be with the accelerometer but with one of
the systems that transmits the data to Mission Control, Pennington
said. Specialists were attempting to find out what went wrong, he
said.
   Weather over North Africa was clear today and the astronauts
snapped pictures of Lake Chad, the Nile Valley and fires in Kenya
for an IMAX film called ``Planet Earth,'' which will document
damage that man and nature are doing to the planet.
   They also probed and poked one another with medical instruments,
seeking information on how the human body adapts over time to space
weightlessness.
   Officials earlier had reported that if Columbia had to come home
early, weather could pose a problem at the primary landing site at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., and a secondary site at White Sands
Space Harbor, N.M.
   But Pennington said a new forecast calls for good weather both
days at both places. He also said the weather was good today over
the runway at the Kennedy Space Center launch site at Cape
Canaveral.
   Mission Control said the weather for Friday's planned landing at
Edwards looked good. A nighttime touchdown is scheduled for 2:59
a.m. PST.
   The wakeup music today was the University of Washington fight
song. One of the crew members, mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar, is
a Washington graduate.
   ``Good morning for your second wakeup of the morning,'' the
control center said, referring to the earlier alarm.
   Brandenstein, Dunbar, pilot Jim Wetherbee and mission
specialists Marsha Ivins and David Low are devoting the final days
of the flight to experiments after accomplishing their main goals
during the first half of the mission.
   They deployed a Navy communications satellite on the second day,
and on the fourth day they snagged an errant 11-ton science
laboratory, and stowed it in the cargo bay for return to Earth.
   One experiment that suffered a mishap on Friday was restored to
health on Sunday. It involves melting and resolidifying a metal,
indium, to determine how the material reacts to the process in
weightless space.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia began talks today
with the Soviet Union on the withdrawal of about 75,000 Soviet
troops, and one source said Czechoslovak officials want at least
half of the force out by May.
   On the eve of the talks, about 6,000 people protested in the
town of Pohorany, demanding the entire Soviet force leave by Aug.
21 _ the 22nd anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion that crushed
the Prague Spring reforms.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Lubos Dobrovsky said last week that
the Soviet forces should leave Czechoslovakia by the end of the
year.
   ``The idea is to have them (Soviets) make a political commitment
during these talks that all the troops will leave by the end of the
year,'' the source said on condition of anonymity.
   ``The rough idea of the time frame on the Czechoslovak side is
to see a 50 to 60 percent withdrawal by mid-May,'' the source said,
adding the talks should focus on technical details of the pullout
as well as its precise timing.
   No details emerged from the talks, led by Deputy Foreign
Minister Evzen Vacek and his Soviet counterpart, Ivan Aboimov.
   The source said demands for the complete withdrawal before Aug.
21 were ``technically out of the question.''
   He noted it took a year to withdraw 5,300 soldiers, 708 tanks
and 200 planes from Czechoslovakia in 1989 as part of a Kremlin
move to withdraw about 50,000 troops from Eastern Europe.
   A peaceful revolution in November and December toppled the
hard-line Communist government. Dissident playwright Vaclav Havel
is now president and Alexander Dubcek, the former Communist Party
chief who sponsored many of the Prague Spring reforms in 1968, is
head of Parliament.
   In another development today, a South Korean government
delegation arrived in Prague to discuss establishing diplomatic
relations, the state CTK news agency reported.
   The delegation was invited by the Foreign Ministry, CTK said.
   South Korea, which is staunchly anti-Communist, has established
formal diplomatic ties with Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia in
recent months.
   In December, South Korea and Czechoslovakia agreed to open trade
offices in each other's countries.

   Giuseppe Rauti, who as a youth joined the
forces of dictator Benito Mussolini, was elected leader of Italy's
neo-fascist party today.
   Rauti, 63, defeated Gianfranco Fini, 38, by a vote of 744-697 to
lead the Italian Social Movement. Fini had led the party since 1987.
   The vote came at the end of a heated congress during which
police were called in to break up fistfights between rival factions.
   The Italian Social Movement is Italy's fourth-largest party in
Parliament and holds 6 percent of the seats in the Chamber of
Deputies. It currently is an opposition party.
   Fini had been the designated successor of Giorgio Almirante, one
of the party's founders and its longtime leader who died in 1988.
   Rauti is considered anti-capitalist and anti-American.
   The Italian Social Movement held its congress in the Adriatic
resort of Rimini, not far from Mussolini's hometown of Predappio,
where party members went to honor his grave during the meeting.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police and national guard units
stopped and searched vehicles today and have arrested 1,200 people
as part of a crackdown on street crime, authorities said.
   President Carlos Andres Perez ordered about 5,000 police and
national guard troops on the streets of Caracas earlier this month
after the slaying of Luis Federico Carbonnell, a University of
Massachusetts professor who was visiting relatives.
   Three men and a woman have been arrested and charged with the
slaying, which police said came in an attempt to steal his car in a
middle-class neighborhood.
   The slaying prompted Perez to announce a restructuring of police
forces and step up the patrols, but several people today doubted
whether the effort would end violence that is tied to economic
problems.
   ``What they're trying to do is avoid another (riot),'' said Luis
Emiro Alvarez, a teen-ager who said he'd been stopped by police
asking him for identification.
   In February, riots broke out following price increases in food
and public transportation claimed 300 lives and thousands injured.
   Police and national guard units today concentrated on major
thoroughfares and stopped cars and buses instead of dispersing into
the outlying slums, where most crime takes place.
   About 1,200 prisoners were taken into custody over the weekend,
national guard spokesmen said.
   The majority of the prisoners were young men guilty of illegal
weapons possesion, drug smuggling and lack of proper documentation,
said Luis Garcia Morales, national guard lieutenant.
   ``Nobody can deny that we have restored tranquility to
Caracas,'' he said. ``Pay attention because this could be one of
the few nights Caracas has no crimes and no criminals.''

   A chimpanzee went on a rampage as it was
being moved early this morning and bit off a veterinarian's ear and
part of one hand, police said.
   Dr. John C. Kelliher, 43, of Adelphi was helping William C.
Holmberg transfer two chimps from their cages to a transport cage
when one of the animals forced its way loose and attacked Kelliher,
police said.
   Holmberg hit the chimp, a 20-year-old male, with a large metal
pipe, said state Trooper Clint Irvin. As the chimp released
Kelliher, Holmberg managed to push the injured veterinarian into an
empty animal cage and lock the door.
   When police officers arrived, Holmberg borrowed a gun from one
of them and shot the chimp four times, but the animal remained
alive until another officer destroyed it with one more shot.
   Kelliher was flown to Presbyterian-University Hospital in
Pittsburgh, where he was listed in fair condition. The thumb,
fourth and fifth fingers on one hand were amputated, his left ear
was bitten off, and he was also bitten on his face, head, scalp and
forearm.
   Holmberg used to run a zoo at a small amusement park in
Westmoreland County, and has been taking care of the chimps and
assorted exotic birds since it closed about five years ago, said
police dispatcher Marilyn Sinsabaugh.
   The chimps were being taken to a laboratory in Maryland when the
attack occurred around 2:15 a.m., Sinsabaugh said. She didn't know
why they were going to the lab.

   Fifty-one Soviet children who were
injured by radiation in the Chernobyl nuclear accident arrived in
Israel today for a month of medical tests.
   Last month, a group of 52 children from the Chernobyl area spent
three weeks on vacation in Israel.
   The visits are part of a thaw between the two nations, which
have not had full diplomatic ties since the Kremlin broke relations
in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   Today's group arrived on a special flight of the Soviet airline
Aeroflot from the Ukrainian capital of Kiev.
   In addition to the children, aged 6 to 13, there were three
Soviet firemen who were exposed to large doses of radiation as well
as five doctors and a Soviet television crew.
   Israeli doctors who studied the children's dossiers in Kiev and
returned home Sunday said some were not properly treated following
the April 1986 catastrophe at the nuclear power plant.
   The children suffer from blood disorders, anemia, glandular
problems, loss of hair and other symptoms associated with radiation
sickness, Israeli doctors said.
   The group was brought here at the initiative of Histadrut,
Israel's trade union federation, which will pay the medical costs.
The flight was paid for by Ukrainian trade unions.
   Israeli doctors said the children would undergo medical tests at
Beilinson Hospital in suburban Tel Aviv that would help properly
diagnose their health status and offer further treatment.
   Rina Zaitzev of the hospital's oncology department said 10
children would be treated each day while others would travel in
Israel.

from the Soviet Union, will share this year's $100,000 prize for
mathematics.
   The awards will be presented in May, along with prizes for
physics, chemistry, agriculture, medicine and the arts.
   De Giorgi, 61, a professor in Pisa, holds a degree in
mathematics from the University of Rome and since 1959 has taught
at the Scuola Normale Superiore, a university in Pisa.
   Piatetski-Shapiro, 60, teaches mathematics at Tel Aviv
University and at Yale University. He earned his doctorate at the
Moscow Pedagogical Institute and taught at Moscow University before
immigrating to Israel in the mid-1970s.
   The Wolf Foundation Prizes were established in 1975 by the late
Ricardo Wolf ``to promote science and art for the benefit of
mankind.'' Wolf was a German-born inventor and philanthropist who
emigrated to Cuba and served as its ambassador to Israel. He died
here in 1981.
   Last year's winners in mathematics were professors John W.
Milnor of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University
and Alberto P. Calderon of the University of Chicago.

   Springsteen and Scialfa, his former backup singer, revealed
their romance publicly in the spring of 1988, after Springsteen
split with his wife, actress Julianne Phillips. He had married Ms.

   Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's former
military strongman, was heavily involved in international
gunrunning, working both sides of the political street, according
to Senate investigators.
   At one point, pilots flying weapons for Noriega to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua are said by witnesses to have flown on to the
United States with a cargo of narcotics.
   Noriega, who controlled Panama security apparatus, was well
positioned to engaged in ``the gray market arms business,''
according to the 1988 report of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on narcotics headed by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
   Even before the death of Gen. Omar Torrijos, then Panama's
ruling figure, in a mysterious 1981 plane crash, Noriega had the
authority to issue certificates to legitimize the shipment of
foreign arms to Panama.
   ``Once in Panama, Noriega would sell the weapons to whomever bid
the most for them,'' the committee said, citing the testimony of
Jose Blandon, a former Panamanian intelligence official and
one-time Noriega adviser.
   Blandon told the subcommittee that Noriega's earliest clients in
the late 1970's included the Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua, who
were successfully battling to oust that country's dictator,
Anastasio Somoza.
   Noriega's associates purchased the weapons in Europe, brought
them to Panama and then moved them into neighboring Costa Rica for
shipment to the Sandinistas.
   Quoting Blandon, the report said that those buying guns for
Noriega included Michael Harari, a retired agent of the Israeli
intelligence service, Mossad.
   Harari, who traveled to Israel immediately after U.S. troops
invaded Panama last month, has been described as one of Noreiga's
closest advisers, a description he rejects as false.
   The Senate panel reported that although Noriega sold many
weapons to the Sandinistas, ``many more wound up in storage when
the Sandinista war ended in 1979.''
   Floyd Carlton, a former Noriega pilot, testified that the excess
weapons were then ``marketed by Panama to the rebels in El
Salvador.''
   Carlton said he and his partner, Cesar Rodriguez, flew the
weapons to El Salvador in 1980 using Panamanian military aircraft.
   On one trip the plane Rodriguez was flying was damaged on
takeoff and crashed when it attempted to land in El Salvador.
   Carlton, flying a second Panamanian plane on the same
weapons-delivery mission, said he pulled Rodriguez from the
aircraft, put him on his plane and flew to Panama, where they both
went into hiding.
   ``When Salvadoran officials discovered the wreckage of the
Panamanian Defense Forces plane, the origin of the weapons was
obvious,'' the panel said.
   Noriega, seeking to expand his arms business, used his contacts
with his military intelligence counterparts in Latin America ``to
find and develop weapons markets which he could supply
profitably,'' the panel said.
   In an apparent disregard for the ideology of his customers, one
such market became the Contra rebels in Nicaragua battling the
now-ruling leftist Sandinistas, the panel said.
   But the arms transfers to the Contras had a double-edged thrust,
according to participants.
   Many of the Panamanian pilots carried mixed cargos of guns and
drugs, the committee was told.
   When they reached Costa Rica, they unloaded the weapons and flew
onto the United States with the narcotics, a witness, Werner Lotz,
told the panel.

<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp., owner of Bloomingdale's and
many other famous American department stores, today placed them
under bankruptcy court protection, allowing the debt-swamped chains
to operate while attempting to work out their troubles.
   The decision to file for Chapter 11 protection was made late
Sunday by the boards of Campeau and its Federated Department Stores
Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. subsidiaries, which operate 260 stores
in the United States, including Rich's, Jordan Marsh and Lazarus as
well as Bloomingdale's.
   It is the biggest Chapter 11 filing in American retailing
history and reflects Campeau's inability to pay off $8 billion in
debt, much of it acquired when the Canadian parent acquired the two
U.S. subsidiaries in the mid-1980s.
   The filing followed weeks of speculation in the retail trade
over how Campeau would deal with the problems of operating its
chains while continuing to pay suppliers.
   ``The decision to seek Chapter 11 relief was based on a
conclusion that action was required at this time in order to
preserve the operations strength and assets of the two department
store companies while the corporate debt is restructured,'' Campeau
said in a news release.
   Campeau said the filing was made in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of Ohio in Cincinnati. Federated and
Allied are based in Cincinnati.
   Carol Sanger, a Cincinnati-based spokeswoman for Campeau, said
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug hadn't issued any orders about
appointment of trustees or set court hearings. The court opened
briefly on the Martin Luther King holiday to receive the Campeau
filing.
   Under a Chapter 11 filing, the companies get a reprieve from
creditor bills and can continue operations while reorganizing their
finances. But all decisions regarding the companies must be
approved by a bankruptcy judge.
   Sanger said Federated and Allied would notify suppliers today of
the filing.
   Toronto-based Campeau, which also owns commercial real estate
and shopping malls in the United States, stated that all of its
U.S. stores would remain open and the company expected all customer
services, such as credit card purchases and merchandise returns, to
continue normally.
   One of the chains, Lazarus, ran full-page ads in Cincinnati and
Columbus newspapers today saying it was conducting ``Business As
Usual.''
   Maria Kaldis, a clerk at a downtown Columbus Lazarus, said
employees learned about the bankruptcy filing early this morning.
``This won't affect the employees at all,'' she said. ``That's
something that doesn't involve us. It's business as usual.''
   In addition to the Chapter 11 filing, the companies announced
today they had negotiated further bank financing to cover their
current cash needs.
   Federated said it had an agreement in principle with a bank
syndicate led by Citibank for $400 million in financing, while
Allied had a similar agreeement from Chemical bank for $300
million. Both are subject to agreement by the syndicates and
approval by the bankruptcy court.
   A number of analysts have said a Chapter 11 filing could benefit
Federated and Allied, by reassuring suppliers they would get paid
if they continued shipping merchandise to the troubled stores.
   Suppliers who ship merchandise to the stores after the Chapter
11 filing would take precedence over many other creditors in
getting paid.
   On Sunday, Campeau had announced it won a five-day reprieve from
a group of banks for a deadline today for deciding whether the
company was in default on a $2.34 billion loan arrangement.
   The banks, lead by Citibank, earlier granted a two-week
extension for the troubled Toronto-based company to prove that it
was able to repay the loan.
   One analyst said the bank move appeared to be in reaction to a
decision by Campeau's board of directors Thursday to split the U.S.
retailing units from the parent company and place them under
independent trustees and directors.
   Under the restructuring announced Thursday, company founder
Robert Campeau lost control of the retailing operations. He will
continue to run Campeau Corp.'s real estate and development
interests, which are based in Toronto.
   Also last week, Campeau made a $100 million payment for
merchandise shipped to its stores between Thanksgiving and
Christmas. There had been speculation that the company could not
make the payment on schedule.
   Observers said Campeau apparently wanted to keep good relations
with its suppliers so they would ship spring merchandise. A decline
in sales at the stores due to a merchandise shortage could make the
stores less valuable should they be sold to raise cash or as part
of a bankruptcy reorganization.
   In a joint statement, John W. Burden III, chairman and chief
executive f Federated and Allied, and James M. Zimmerman, president
and chief operating officer of the companies, said they expected
the Chapter 11 filing to have a positive effect on their businesses
by allowing the retailers to concentrate on sales rather than their
financial problems.
   ``At the same time, under Chapter 11 protection, corporate
management will have the necessary time to aggressively address the
problems that exist at the corporate level with the burdensome
capital structure that precipitated today's actions.''
   Campeau already has put Bloomingdale's up for sale as part of
its broad restructuring attempt. Burden and Zimmerman stated the
company would continue receiving bids for Bloomingdale's as part of
the Chapter 11 proceedings.
   Allied owns the Jordan Marsh, The Bon Marche, Maas Brothers and
Stern's department stores. In addition to Bloomingdale's, Federated
runs the Burdine's, Lazarus, Abraham &amp; Straus and Rich's chains.
   Campeau also owns Ralphs, a Southern California supermarket
chain spun off from Federated. The business was unaffected by the
filings.

   Tens of thousands of people today stormed the
headquarters of East Germany's hated secret police, and a
prosecutor said he will indict former Communist leader Erich
Honecker for high treason.
   The charge, which also will be sought against the former head of
the secret police, carries a minimum penalty of 10 years in prison
and a maximum of death in ``exceptionally grave cases.''
   The situation at secret police headquarters had gotten ``out of
control,'' state television reported. The reports forced a hasty
suspension of talks between the government and the opposition.
   ``We are the people! We are the people!'' the protesters shouted
as they stormed the building. The official news agency ADN said
tens of thousands invaded the building, while state-run television
spoke of 100,000 people.
   Witnesses saw the protesters going through the offices,
overturning furniture and scattering documents. Several people went
into a store room, carrying away wine, battles of ketchup and other
items.
   Protesters used stones and bricks to break through glass doors
to get into the building, according to witnesses. ADN reported that
some people were throwing furniture through office windows.
   The Communist-dominated government has reluctantly agreed to
disband the secret police, following massive protests from East
Germans.
   Chief prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph told officials at the
government-opposition talks that Honecker and former national
security chief Erich Mielke are being investigated for
``anti-constitutional association'' and high treason.
   Joseph did not say when a formal indictment was expected,
although one is virtually certain under East Germany's criminal
justice system once an investigation begins.
   Honecker and Mielke already had been under investigation for
corruption and abuse of power. Honecker was removed as Communist
Party leader on Oct. 18. He later was thrown out of the party and
at one point was under house arrest at a luxury residential complex
that had been reserved for party leaders.
   Mielke headed the secret police, which has become a target of
bitter criticism since the Communists were forced to share power in
East Germany's peaceful revolution.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow today promised to publicize
details of how the secret police force is being dismantled and he
appealed for an end to strikes.
   Modrow made the comments at talks between the Communist-led
government and an increasingly restive opposition. He had said he
would not attend the talks but changed his mind, apparently bowing
to opposition pressure.
   Manfred Sauer, a government official helping to oversee the
dismantling of the secret police, told the talks that there had
been 85,000 full-time secret police agents and 109,000 informants.
   That means that up until a few months ago, one out of every 80
people in this country of 16.3 million worked for or routinely
cooperated with the secret police.
   Modrow also promised that ``all available data and acts
regarding the dissolution'' of the secret police will be made
public.
   He had planned to replace the secret police, known as ``Stasi,''
with a new force but the opposition bitterly fought the plan and
Modrow abandoned it on Friday.
   He said a new security force was needed to counter the threat of
growing neo-Nazi activity. But the opposition said that threat was
greatly exaggerated and that a new security agency should be
created after the election by a democratically elected government.
   Modrow initially rejected opposition demands that he attend
today's session of the talks, but he changed his mind after facing
criticism from pro-democracy groups over the weekend.
   He appealed for understanding and calm and called on
representatives of the 16 political parties and groups present to
cooperate in solving the nation's troubles. Those troubles are
compounded by the emigration of more than 1,800 people a day to
West Germany.
   ``Public life must not be disturbed by strikes,'' Modrow said
during the session, broadcast live on television.
   In recent days, workers have staged warning strikes in various
cities, including Erfurt and East Berlin, to pressure the
Communists to share more power and abolish the hated secret police.
   Modrow said he also would attend next Monday's session of the
talks, apparently in an effort to counter opposition allegations he
was not taking the negotations seriously.
   An East German television commentator called Modrow's appearance
``a clever move'' aimed at defusing the growing challenges to his
shaky coalition government.
   There have been doubts as to whether Modrow's coalition can
survive until the democratic elections scheduled for May 6. He
bowed to previous opposition pressure last week by scrapping plans
to form a new secret police agency.
   Markus Meckel, a leader of the influential Social Democratic
party, praised Modrow's appearance and said the premier's statement
provided the basis to ``ensure the government's work and
competence'' until the elections.
   The Social Democrats over the weekend called for German
unfication and promised to open talks with West Germany if they win
the May elections.
   East Germans demanding curbs on Communist power kept pressure on
Modrow's government Sunday with more protests.
   Several hundred thousand people in several cities attended
ceremonies commemorating the 1919 murders of two heroes of the
German left.
   In another development, East Germans began paying higher prices
for children's clothing and related articles, and Finance Minister
Uta Nickel said apartment rents also were likely to increase.
   Ms. Nickel did not give specific figures in her interview with
the labor federation newspaper Tribuene, but said the government
intends to move ahead with dismantling massive government subsidies.
   And the Israeli newspaper Maariv and army radio reported that
Israeli and East German officials plan to meet in the next few days
to discuss establishing diplomatic relations.
   Officials at the Israeli Foreign Ministry said they were
checking the report. East German officials were not immediately
available for comment.

<HEAD>Durenberger to Face Ethics Panel, Admitting `Lapses in Judgment'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. David Durenberger, conceding in advance
some of the evidence looks bad, will face the Senate Ethics
Committee early next month to give his side of real estate and book
promotion deals the panel has been investigating.
   In the meantime, he has been apologizing and explaining ``lapses
in judgement'' to the voters back home, where he won re-election
barely a year ago.
   The Minnesota Republican is tentatively set to appear before the
Ethics Committee Feb. 8, while it is still conducting a grand
jury-type investigation to determine if there is ``substantial
credible evidence'' that he broke Senate rules. The date was
confirmed by Senate sources, insisting on anonymity.
   Saying he was ignoring his attorney's objections, Durenberger
broke a yearlong silence on the case in late December.
   He held a series of news conferences to apologize to fellow
Minnesotans, told a home-state newspaper that unreleased statements
on his book deal appeared to back allegations against him and
blamed his trusted friends for ``sloppy legal work'' that caused
some of his problems.
   Then he stopped talking again.
   Durenberger has confirmed the Ethics Committee is investigating:
   _Whether $100,000 he earned in 1985-86 to promote two books
should have been counted as speaking fees _ exceeding Senate limits
on such honoraria outside income.
   _Whether it was proper to use special interest groups to
underwrite ``dual purpose'' trips to Boston, where he met with a
marriage counselor and also held sessions with the organizations
that paid his way.
   _Whether he was right to charge the Senate rent when staying in
a Minneapolis condominium he partly owned.
   In his Minnesota news conferences, Durenberger spoke in personal
terms, saying his ethics problems began after he separated from his
wife, sought out a Harvard educator-marriage counselor and had to
deal with paying for his four sons' education.
   ``In retrospect, it is clear that I made mistakes and had lapses
in judgment on these matters,'' he said. ``I am deeply sorry.''
   Last week, Durenberger told the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch
that he read a summary of witness statements on the book promotion,
prepared by his attorney but not made public.
   He said of the promotion, ``It appears to be an effort to get
around the honoraria limits because I'm out there speaking to the
same groups I might be speaking to for honoraria.''
   ``Some people allege that they didn't know that I was speaking
pursuant to a relationship with a publisher. They thought I was
responding to a request to give an honorarium speech.''
   Durenberger's voluntary comments about such damaging statements
prompted one Senate source, insisting on anonymity, to comment,
``Whose side is he on?''
   The senator's spokeswoman, Carrie Collins, now says Durenberger
will no longer comment on anything the Ethics Committee is doing.
   Durenberger is not the only senator under investigation by the
committee. Also under scrutiny are Sens. John McCain of Arizona,
Alan Cranston of California, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan,
DeConcini of Arizona and former astronaut John Glenn of Ohio for
their contacts in the case of a troubled savings and loan, and
Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York in connection with housing deals.
   But the Minnesotan's case has reached the furthest stage of any
inquiry since the panel recommended the expulsion of former Sen.
Harrison A. Williams Jr. in 1982. Williams, who had been convicted
in the Abscam political bribery cases, resigned as his colleagues
were about to vote his ouster.
   After Durenberger appears before the committee, the panel must
decide whether to issue a statement of possible violations, similar
to an indictment.
   Such a finding would trigger an investigation akin to a trial in
which the committee would decide whether an actual rules violation
occurred. If one or more violations were found, the committee could
recommend disciplinary action to the full Senate.
   Punishment under committee rules could include recommendation of
expulsion, censure or a lesser penalty. Usually, colleagues would
consider expulsion only in extreme cases, such as a felony
conviction.
   In the book deal, Durenberger in 1985-86 made at least 40
speaking appearances under a contract with his publisher, with the
fees to be split between the two.
   ``It's now evident that the distinction between promotional
appearances and honoraria speeches became unclear,'' Durenberger
said. ``Books were not always available or on display at
promotional speeches and some audiences have now said they were
confused by the distinction.''
   Beginning in July 1985, Durenberger said, he began seeing his
Boston area marriage counselor, but used the trips ``to seek out
opportunities to meet'' with special interest groups that paid his
way.
   Durenberger said he now believes ``the situation occurred too
frequently'' and that he let his ``personal needs weigh too heavily
on the timing and location of meetings I was properly conducting as
a senator.''
   The senator said his lawyers and tax advisers told him he could
transfer his Minneapolis condominium to a partnership, pay rent to
the partnership and use the Senate's per diem travel allowance to
defray the cost of the rent.
   ``I should have recognized that using my Senate travel allowance
to pay rent to a partnership in which I had any kind of interest
would be viewed as improper,'' said Durenberger, who no longer owns
a share of the condominium.

<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aging leaders of the African National
Congress who spent the past quarter-century in South African
prisons had an emotional reunion Monday with the exiled leadership
of their guerrilla movement.
   Walter Sisulu and Govan Mbeki, two of the eight who returned,
were embraced at Lusaka's airport by sons they had not seen since
they were convicted along with Nelson Mandela at a treason and
sabotage trial in 1964.
   Their sons, Max Sisulu and Thabo Mbeki, themselves ANC
officials, were among a crowd of about 1,000 people gathered in the
rain at the airport to greet the eight when they arrived aboard a
chartered Zambian Airways jet.
   ``Im thrilled. I counted down the hours all day,'' said Max
Sisulu, 44, who fled South Africa in 1963. ``This is a historic
moment for me and my family.''
   ``Naturally, I'm very excited,'' said his 77-year-old father,
formerly the ANC's secretary-general.
   Lusaka is the headquarters-in-exile for the ANC, which has been
outlawed in South Africa since 1960. The movement began a bombing
and sabotage campaign in 1961 aimed at ending white-minority
domination.
   The eight visitors, all in their 60s and 70s, will spend a week
in Lusaka renewing old friendships and helping to coordinate the
ANC's political strategy. They then plan visits to Britain and
Sweden.
   ``Today serves as a signal that we are getting closer to our
goal of abolishing apartheid and establishing a democratic,
non-racial South Africa,'' said Alfred Nzo, the ANC's
secretary-general.
   ``Our immense joy today is tempered by the absence of some our
people,'' he said, referring to ANC president Oliver Tambo, who is
recuperating in Sweden from a stroke, and to Mandela, who remains
imprisoned in South Africa but is expected to be released within
weeks.
   The reunion, attended by Zambian officials and foreign
diplomats, was to be followed by talks on how the ANC should
respond to the rapidly changing political situation in South
Africa. President F.W. de Klerk is urging the ANC and other
opposition groups to join in negotiating a new constitution that
would extend some form of political rights to blacks.
   The ANC has said it will not enter negotiations with de Klerk
until Mandela and other political prisoners are freed, the ANC is
unbanned, troops are withdrawn from black townships, and the
government halts political trials.
   The eight visitors to Lusaka included six men released by de
Klerk in October, all of whom spent more than 25 years in prison.
The others are Mbeki, 79, released in 1987 after 23 years in jail,
and Harry Gwala, freed in 1988 after more than 10 years in prison.
   The other visitors included Andrew Mlangeni, Raymond Mahlaba,
Elias Motsoaledi, Ahmed Kathrada and Wilton Mkwayi. Of those five,
all but Mkwayi were co-defendants along with Mandela, Sisulu and
Mbeki in the 1964 treason trial.
   Thabo Mbeki, 47, head of foreign affairs for the ANC, is
considered a leading contender for the presidency of the movement
if Tambo is replaced.
   The visitors all were top ranking officials of ANC when sent to
prison but no longer hold formal positions.
   ANC spokesman Tom Sebina said the issue of positions for them
won't be discussed until the ANC's national conference in June.
   ``Our function is only to help and participate in whatever
direction the (ANC) national executive takes,'' said Walter Sisulu.
   The eight arrived wearing business suits and scarves of green,
gold and black _ the ANC's colors. They were to meet with Zambian
President Kenneth Kaunda, a longtime supporter of the ANC.

<HEAD>New Chinese Representative to Hong Kong</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Zhou Nan, a career diplomat regarded as a
conservative and a tough negotiator, has been named by China as its
next official representative to Hong Kong.
   Zhou, currently vice foreign minister, was appointed director of
the Hong Kong branch of the official Xinhua News Agency, China's de
facto ambassador to the British colony, Xinhua reported Monday.
   He replaces Xu Jiatun, 74, a popular figure who has served in
the post since 1983.
   A Western political analyst in Hong Kong had said that Zhou's
expected appointment may signal a hardening of Beijing's attitude
toward Hong Kong.
   Since China's use of military force to suppress pro-democracy
protests in June 1989, the Beijing government has accused Britain
of allowing what it says are anti-communist political activities in
Hong Kong.
   It also has criticized moves to quicken the pace of democratic
reform in Hong Kong and blasted the British government for plans to
grant residence permits to 50,000 Hong Kong families as an escape
valve in case China does not live up to its promise to allow Hong
Kong to keep its capitalist system after it reverts to Chinese rule
in 1997.
   Zhou was China's main negotiator when Hong Kong Gov. Sir David
Wilson visited last week for talks that apparently made little
headway in resolving differences between the two sides.
   Zhou, 62, has worked in the Foreign Ministry since the 1950s. He
has served overseas in Pakistan, Tanzania and at the United
Nations, and has worked as vice minister since 1984.
   He was involved in the 1984 Sino-British talks leading to the
agreement on the return of Hong Kong in 1997, serving as chairman
of the Chinese delegation. He also was appointed chairman of the
delegation to the Sino-Portuguese talks resulting in the agreement
to return Macao to Chinese rule in 1999.

   NBC on Monday named Tom Capra, a veteran news
producer and son of film director Frank Capra, as the new executive
producer of the ``Today'' show, effective Jan. 29.
   Capra is currently news director at NBC-owned KNBC-TV in
Burbank, Calif., and formerly worked as producer for both CBS News
and ABC News. He succeeds Marty Ryan, who has run ``Today'' since
June 1987.
   The move, which industry reports have said was expected, is the
latest change at NBC's once-dominant morning program, which in
recent weeks has been in a tight ratings battle with ABC's ``Good
Morning America.''
   Last month, Jane Pauley, ``Today'' co-host for 13 years, left
the show for other NBC News projects. She was succeeded by Deborah
Norville, who in September succeeded John Palmer as the program's
news anchor.
   Capra was picked for ``Today'' after the collapse of
negotiations to bring David Nuell, executive producer of
``Entertainment Tonight,'' to NBC for three jobs, including one as
senior executive producer of ``Today.''
   Nuell since has returned to the syndicated entertainment series.

   A man was held in the death of a
3-year-old who apparently suffocated when she was force-fed an
entire chocolate cake, police said.
   Frank F. Johnson, 46, of Baton Rouge was booked Sunday on a
murder charge, accused of failing to help Myra Griffin when the
incident occurred Dec. 21, said Officer Jeff Wesley.
   Myra's mother, Marjorie Griffin, 23, of Baton Rouge, was charged
with first-degree murder last month. She is accused of
force-feeding the child.
   ``This was a cake she had made for the child, and she was
determined the child was going to eat the entire cake,'' Wesley
said. ``When the child refused to eat the entire cake, she
force-fed it to the child. Allegedly.''
   An autopsy found Myra suffocated because her stomach and throat
were stuffed with so much chocolate cake that it blocked her
windpipe, Deputy Coroner Chuck Smith said.
   Under Louisiana law, the killing of a child under the age of 12
is first-degree murder, a charge for which bond is not allowed.

<HEAD>Ex-Officials Ask Bush to Communicate with Mandela</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight former high government officials asked
President Bush on Monday to write to Nelson Mandela, the jailed
South African black freedom leader whom American officials are not
permitted to see, as a step toward nudging both sides in South
Africa toward negotiations.
   For Bush to contact Mandela ``could well contribute to his
release and return to political life,'' the ex-officials said.
   Their call for a U.S. role as a broker in the dispute between
South Africa's black majority and its white government was issued
under the auspices of the Foreign Policy Institute.
   Affiliated with the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
Interntional Studies, the institute seeks consensus positions that
can be endorsed by former officials representing a range of
political philosophies.
   The South African statement was signed by Harold Brown, former
secretary of defense; William T. Coleman Jr., former transportation
secretary; Barbara Jordan, former Democratic congresswoman from
Texas; Melvin Laird, former defense secretary; Edmund Muskie,
former secretary of state; Herman Nickel, the Reagan
administration's ambassador to South Africa; and former Republican
senators Charles McC. Mathias of Maryland and Charles Percy of
Illinois.
   The former officials praised Bush for meeting with
anti-apartheid clerics and black leaders from South Africa, but
said the time had come for the United States to go further and
engage the leaders of the South African government and its leading
black antagonist, the African National Congress, which Mandela
heads.
   ``By word and deed, the president must communicate to people at
home and abroad that he shares the deep concern of all Americans
about the racial injustice of the apartheid system and its
destructive impact on the entire region and that he has an active
agenda to deal with it,'' the statement said.
   There need not be ``an American solution to South Africa's
problems,'' the ex-officials said, but the United States can help
break the logjam that has blocked negotiations.
   Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III should ``engage
all the major players in a dialogue on what is needed _ and what
each is prepared to do _ to get to the bargaining table and to keep
talks from collapsing,'' they said.
   As part of a policy of using both inducements and pressures on
the white government of President F. W. DeKlerk, the ex-officials
said the United States should be willing to reconsider its support
of a freeze that has prevented South Africa from making loans from
the International Monetary Fund.
   They called additionally for the creation by Congress of a
National Foundation for a Democratic South Africa, whose
appropriated funds would be matched by private contributions. It
would use the money to help Black South Africans ``realize their
individual and collective potential and to build a non-racial
democratic society.''
   U.S. firms that have pulled out of South Africa would be able to
contribute their blocked South African currency accounts to the
foundation and get U.S. tax credits in exchange.

<HEAD>Bush to Propose Tax-Free Accounts to Encourage More Saving</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is getting ready to
offer a new enticement to encourage Americans to be more thrifty,
hoping to boost the country's low savings rate,
   President Bush will ask Congress to create a new ``family
savings account'' that would allow people to earn tax-free interest
and dividends on money that is squirreled away for a specified
number of years, administration officials said.
   These officials, who spoke on condition that their names not be
used, said the savings accounts would be part of the president's
1991 budget, due to be released on Jan. 29, and would also be
featured in Bush's State of the Union address to Congress on Jan.
31.
   The administration is touting the proposal as a key to
bolstering the country's lagging international economic fortunes,
by increasing the pool of money available for investment and thus
lowering the costs American businesses must pay to expand and
modernize.
   However, many private economists remain skeptical, saying while
the proposal would be a popular tax-break for the middle class, it
would do little to boost overall savings.
   ``Our past experience shows that these accounts don't do very
much good in boosting savings,'' said David Wyss, an economist with
DRI-McGraw Hill, a private economic consulting firm. ``The people
who will take advantage of them would have saved anyway.''
   Officials said that the Bush proposal is still being fine-tuned,
but they gave the following details of what the final plan is
expected to look like.
   It will allow families to contribute as much as $5,000 per year
and individuals to contribute as much as $2,500 annually. The
accounts would be limited to families with incomes below $120,000 a
year and to individuals making below $60,000 annually.
   Unlike Individual Retirement Accounts, taxpayers would not be
able to deduct their annual contributions from their taxable
income. But the interest and dividends would accumulate tax-free.
At the end of the required holding period, the accumulated savings
could be withdrawn and spent without any tax bite from Uncle Sam.
   Sources said the administration was still mulling how long a
period to require. Seven years was mentioned as the most likely
choice, although there was some sentiment for a longer period,
possibly 10 years.
   The holding period, whether seven or 10 years, would be a
radical departure from IRAs, which require that the investment be
held until the taxpayer turns 59{. If the money is withdrawn before
that time, a 10 percent penalty is imposed.
   The new account has been promoted within the administration by
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, whose department has been
studying ways to boost America's competitive standing, noting that
Americans managed to save only 4.4 percent of their after-tax
income in 1988, just one-fourth of the Japanese savings rate.
   ``This is a straightforward effort to try to change behavior,''
said Sidney Jones, assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy.
``It is a very simple concept, very understandable and very
forthright.''
   The administration's plan, once it is unveiled, will compete for
support with a rival plan pushed by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Bentsen's plan would
expand the coverage of the current IRAs.
   All workers were allowed fully deductible IRAs before passage of
the 1986 tax overhaul. That law made them available only to workers
not covered by a company pension and to covered workers with
incomes under $25,000 and couples under $40,000. Partial deductions
are allowed couples with incomes under $50,000 and individuals with
incomes under $35,000.
   Bentsen and various private economists have questioned whether
the administration's family savings accounts would do much to
stimulate savings since taxpayers would receive no immediate
benefit from their contributions, unlike the IRA.
   Critics say the administration chose a back-ended approach to
supplying tax benefits in order to minimize the near-term budgetary
impact.
   ``The administration hasn't got the nerve to propose the
old-fashioned IRA which would increase next year's deficit so they
are proposing to increase the deficit 10 years down the road,''
said Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution.

   Worshipers at Martin Luther King Jr.'s church
were urged today on the slain civil rights leader's birthday to
keep alive his memory and his philosophy of non-violence.
   ``This is a man who is a deep current in our memory,'' said the
Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of Glide Memorial United Methodist
Church in San Francisco. ``Let us live then not only his dream, but
let us live the practice of non-violence and unconditional love.''
   Williams spoke at the annual ecumenical service at Ebenezer
Baptist Church.
   Church services, parades, and other celebrations were held
nationwide during the weekend before the federal holiday, which for
the first time falls on the slain civil-rights leader's actual
birthday.
   He would have been 61 today.
   Also planned today in Atlanta was a ``March of Celebration''
parade, being televised nationally for the first time.
   A former King lieutenant, the Rev. Hosea Williams, stood in
front of an Atlanta housing project to criticize the day's
activities for making a travesty of King's dream of equality and
justice.
   Williams, King's field organizer in the civil rights movement,
complained that people were starving in the city while thousands of
dollars were being spent on the parade. ``I am really upset with
all this gaiety,'' he said.
   This year's holiday follows a series of bombings and threats,
apparently racially motivated, in the Southeast, and a flareup of
racial tensions in Boston after an apparent hoax in which a white
man had claimed a black mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife.
   It also comes at a time of gains for blacks _ the election of
David Dinkins, first black mayor of New York City, and the nation's
first elected black governor, L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia.
   ``Today, the sound of libery is being heard all around the
world,'' said James Farmer, founder of the Congress for Racial
Equality, as he pounded three times with his fist on the Liberty
Bell in Philadelphia. ``Those who have been denied liberty love it
most. Dr. King loved liberty and he fought and died for it.''
   The New York Stock Exchange held a moment of silence at noon.
   In New Hampshire, one of just four states without some form of
King holiday, about 200 Merrimack Valley High School pupils walked
out of morning classes today in Concord to recognize Martin Luther
King Day, which the school does not observe.
   ``This is our own personal way of remembering him,'' said senior
Mike Krumenacker, one of three pupils who organized the impromptu
gathering of about a third of the school's pupils.
   And in another of the four states, Arizona, thousands marched in
Phoenix and Tucson today to honor King. A racially mixed crowd
carried black balloons along a four-mile stretch of downtown
Phoenix as they headed for a rally at the state Capitol.
   King, the son of an Atlanta Baptist minister, led non-violent
marches in the South in the 1950s and 1960s in a quest to end
discrimination against blacks and other minorities. He was
assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.
   On Sunday, Coretta Scott King delivered her annual ``state of
the dream'' address at Ebenezer Baptist Church.
   King's widow applauded pro-democracy shifts worldwide and said
the civil rights movement would not be deterred by the recent wave
of bombings and threats against blacks. A federal judge and a black
Savannah lawyer were killed in two bombings.
   ``In the last year, we've seen hundreds of thousands of people
marching through the streets of Berlin and Beijing, Budapest and
Pretoria, Moscow, Warsaw and Prague, all singing `We Shall
Overcome' in a host of languages,'' she said.
   ``We're not going to be turned around by letter bombs or threats
or any kind of violence,'' she said. ``Instead, we're going
forward, with unity and courage and commitment.''
   Also in Atlanta, more than 500 students and teachers at Booker
T. Washington High School joined civil rights leader Rosa Parks to
paint a mural dedicated to King. The mural displayed, ``Let Freedom
Ring.''
   In Boston, where blacks have complained about aggressive police
tactics in their search for the killer of a pregnant white woman in
October, about 25 activists planned to demonstrate at a King
memorial breakfast today to protest the presence of Mayor Raymond
Flynn.
   Tensions have been heightened after revelations that Charles
Stuart himself probably killed his wife. He committed suicide this
month.
   ``We don't feel Mayor Flynn should have a seat of honor at this
occasion,'' said Sadiki Kambon, director of a group called the
Community for Human Rights.
   ``The mayor came on the scene that (October) night and was told
by police that an African male killed a white female,'' Kambon
said. ``The mandate was `Get me someone,' and the police proceeded
to roust black males in Mission Hill and the entire city.''
   In New York, Dinkins told about 400 people at Judson Memorial
Church that ``Dr. King took us to the dawn of a new era. It is up
to us to push on into the bright light of day.''
   Wilder, sworn in Saturday, said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With
David Brinkley'' on Sunday that a black could occupy the White
House ``in our time.''
   In Seattle, the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president and co-founder of
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, addressed 900 people
Saturday night.
   ``Don't let them make a pious dreamer out of him,'' Lowery said.
``He was a non-violent revolutionary. ... The spirit of Martin
Luther King demands that we be activists.''
   Federal offices were closed today, and most states gave the day
off to their workers as well. The four without any form of King
holiday are Arizona, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire, but some
other states kept workers on the job but marked the day in some
other way.

<HEAD>Report Mandela Favors Retaining Market Economy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imprisoned nationalist leader
Nelson Mandela favors retaining South Africa's free market economy
after years of backing plans for a state-run economy, according to
news reports Monday.
   Several Johannesburg newspapers quoted leading black businessman
Richard Maponya as saying Mandela told him he was ``definitely
inclined towards a free enterprise system'' rather than
nationalization or state control of industries.
   The two men, who are close friends, met recently at Victor
Verster Prison where Mandela is being held. The reports did not say
when the two met.
   Mandela in the past has supported an economic program calling
for the nationalization of mines, banks and other key sectors of
the economy as ways to advance majority rule.
   The reports said Mandela sees free market forces as the best way
of providing for the needs of the nation's rapidly expanding
population.
   ``The message Mandela wanted me to take away from Victor Verster
was his belief that the economy is the backbone of any nation,''
Maponya was quoted as saying.
   ``He said he did not believe in nationalization because it was
clear such a policy ran counter to the need to keep the South
African economy growing to provide jobs,'' Maponya said.
   Mandela, the nation's most prominent black leader, is expected
to be released soon as part of the government's moves to abandon
apartheid and negotiate with the country's black majority. Mandela
is allowed to receive visitors such as Maponya and has held
contacts with government officials.
   The African National Congress, the main black power group to
which Mandela belongs, still supports nationalization. A change in
Mandela's position on the economy could lead to a serious division
within the ANC.
   Maponya said Mandela was concerned that blacks be able to take
part in the economy to counter the growing problems of mass
unemployment, poor housing and poverty.
   ``He was concerned as to whether black people were getting
themselves geared up to take up opportunities as they arose,''
Maponya was quoted as saying.
   ``I told him of the training of quite a number of young
entrepreneurs and he said this was a very good thing.''

   Rock superstar Bruce Springsteen, known for such
hits as ``Born in the U.S.A.,'' and his girlfriend, Patti Scialfa,
are expecting a baby, a spokeswoman said Monday.
   Marilyn Laverty, spokeswoman for Columbia Records, the singer's
record company, confirmed a report in USA Today about the pregnancy
but did not say when the baby is due or whether the couple will
marry.
   Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau, did not immediately return a
call seeking comment.
   Springsteen, 40, and Scialfa, his former backup singer, revealed
their romance publicly in 1988 after Springsteen split with his
wife, actress Julianne Phillips. The couple had no children.

   A growing need for instant gratification
is leading to the decline of American society, consumer activist
Ralph Nader says.
   Nader, speaking Sunday at the University of Rochester's
week-long conference on pleasure, said the pursuit of pleasure has
put America, which is ``wallowing in one fad after another,'' at a
disadvantage with more disciplined Japan.
   The Japanese ``have turned adversity into an asset,'' he said.
``We have turned abundance into a liability.''
   Nader said the pleasure principle also works in politics.
Candidates appeal for votes by using flattery instead of a real
message, he said.
   ``In the 1980s we had political leaders whose primary message
was `Go for the gold,''' he said. ``That was Ronald Reagan. He
didn't give one speech like John F. Kennedy that inspired idealism
in the young.''

<HEAD>Off-Duty Soldier Stabbed, 30 Palestinians Detained</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An off-duty Israeli soldier was stabbed as she
walked along a narrow street in Jerusalem's Old City on Monday and
30 Palestinians were detained for questioning, police said.
   Reports from the West Bank town of Nablus, meanwhile, said that
eight masked Palestinians marched through the central market in a
show of force aimed at ending a rash of kidnappings of Arabs
suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   The Israeli soldier, identified as Pvt. Halit Avni, 18, of Tel
Aviv, was stabbed six times in the back and chest, police said. She
was listed in stable condition, said Ruth Mekel, spokeswoman at
Hadassah Hospital in Ein Karem.
   Sixty Palestinians were rounded up for questioning and half were
later released, said police spokesman Uzi Sandori.
   Witnesses said Avni was wearing an olive drab army-issue snow
suit when she was attacked as she hiked alone in the Arab quarter.
   Attacks in Jerusalem have been rare in the 25-month Palestinian
uprising. On Sept. 20, a Jewish seminary student was stabbed in the
same area. In May, a Moslem fundamentalist knifed two elderly Jews
to death as they sat at a bus stop in Jewish west Jerusalem.
   In the Nablus march, four men fired five times in the air to
draw attention, Arab reports said. They then announced through a
loudspeaker that ``the general security unit warns any group
against the kidnapping of innocent people.''
   The warning by the security unit, responsible to the PLO Fatah
faction's central command in Nablus, was the latest from Fatah
leaders trying to end attacks on suspected collaborators.
   At least 170 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs in
the 25-month uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
against Israeli occupation, most on suspicion of collaboration. At
least 647 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or
civilians, and 43 Israelis have died.
   In December, leaflets attributed to PLO leader Yasser Arafat's
mainstream Fatah faction called for an end to killings without
authorization from the PLO-backed leadership of the uprising.
   The security unit was sent to the streets after a series of
kidnappings of suspected collaborators by Palestinian ``strike
forces'' set up to enforce uprising rules, Arab reporters said.
   They said that at least 20 people were abducted and questioned
in the past four weeks in the Nablus area and that some were beaten
before being freed.
   The last killing of a collaborator in the city was Dec. 14, they
said.
   Also Monday, a district court in Tel Aviv sentenced a Jewish
settler from Yizhar in the West Bank to 5{ years in prison for
wounding two Palestinians.
   The court was told that Rafi Salomon, 24, disguised himself in a
red checkered Arab scarf and fired on Palestinians waiting at a bus
stop near Tel Aviv. The incident occurred after an emotional
funeral for another settler who had been stabbed to death by three
Palestinian.
   In the Gaza Strip, 11 Palestinians were shot and wounded in
stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops, hospital officials
said. The incidents occurred a day after Gaza schools reopened
after a holiday break.

   Azerbaijanis and Armenians with submachine guns
battled in one region of Azerbaijan in ethnic clashes that have
claimed at least 32 lives, official media said today. Soviet
officials declared a state of emergency in parts of the republic.
   The Kremlin flew reinforcements of internal security troops to
Azerbaijan to try to stop the bloodletting, the worst between the
two ethnic groups since their long-simmering feud in the Caucasus
boiled over nearly two years ago.
   The Soviet Presidium, led by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, declared a state of emergency in the Nagorno-Karabakh
region and several areas near it, the scene of open armed conflict
between gunmen of the feuding nationalities, Soviet TV announced
tonight.
   The text of the decree was to be published later, but Prime
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov earlier told a correspondent from the
Norwegian broadcasting company NRK that the Kremlin was considering
imposing a military administration and a curfew to stop the
fighting.
   He said the Soviet army would be sent in if necessary to
reinforce internal security troops already in the region, who have
been unable to halt the bloodshed.
   State-run television said 300 Azerbaijanis and Armenians fought
in the Shaumyanovsk region of Azerbaijan, near the disputed region
of Ngorno-Karabakh. It quoted a soldier as saying Armenians fought
back with hunting rifles and Kalashnikov submachine guns when a
group of Azerbaijanis tried to set fire to an Armenian farm.
   Attacks on the homes of Armenians living in Azerbaijan continue,
with more killings and six more bodies found, the TV news program
``Vremya'' said. Four of the dead were Armenians, and the others
were of unidentified nationality, it said.
   Sevinth Abdulayeva, the chief editor of Azerbaijan's official
news agency Azerinform, said in a telephone interview that
Armenians hiding in the woods were firing on passing cars in
Shaumyanovsk and an adjoining region. She said the Armenians were
receiving guns and ammunition ferried in by unmarked helicopters.
   Soviet media said authorities had lost control in some parts of
the southern republic, where most of the victims were Armenians
attacked by mobs of Azerbaijanis in the capital of Baku. Many
Armenians were reported fleeing.
   The official Tass news agency said some Azerbaijanis were armed
with machine guns and said that in one part of the republic,
Communist and government officials were taken hostage.
   Soviet radio said high-level troubleshooters were dispatched to
Baku, where the killing began Saturday night and continued Sunday,
and to Yerevan, capital of the neighboring republic of Armenia.
   ``Armenia is in a state of battle readiness,'' Karen
Shakhbazyan, an Armenian activist, said today by telephone from
Yerevan, where Soviet television said people were reported massing
outside government offices demanding the return of weapons
confiscated from them earlier.
   A Russian witness in Baku described a street awash in blood and
said victims there included two women tossed from balconies and an
old woman who was shot point-blank when confronted by an unruly
mob. She spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.
   Soviet media said the ``pogroms of Armenian homes and murders''
continued Sunday. It gave no details.
   Azerbaijanis and Armenians are locked in a feud over who should
govern Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainly Armenian enclave of 160,000
people controlled by Azerbaijan since 1923.
   Most Armenians are Christians; most Azerbaijanis are Shiite
Moslems.
   Two ferries evacuated about 660 Armenians, mostly women and
children, from Baku across the Caspian Sea to Krasnovodsk in the
republic of Turkmenia and about 200 others were sheltered from
attacks in the capital, Soviet TV said.
   In Yerevan, 300,000 people rallied Sunday night to demand
authorities take more resolute action to protect their brethren.
Shakhbazyan said at least 100 armed police massed at Yerevan's
airport today hoping to fly to villages in Azerbaijan to defend
Armenians under siege.
   Armenian journalists working for state-run agencies said the
death toll in Baku had risen to 32. Others were killed in other
parts of Azerbaijan, the official Tass news agency reported without
giving figures.
   Radio Moscow said the strife was kindled in Baku, a major
petroleum-producing center, when two Azerbaijanis visited an
Armenian family Saturday and demanded they leave town. The
Armenians had an ax, and the Azerbaijanis were hurt in a struggle
and taken to a hospital. One died and the other was in serious
condition, the radio said.
   The news enraged a crowd of about 150,000 that gathered later in
Baku's central square, and speakers called for driving the
Armenians out of the capital, a port of 1.7 million people.
   Late Sunday, Tass reported violence in the Shaumyanovsk and
Khanlar regions, saying there were ``tens of dead and wounded from
both nationalities.''
   In Shaumyanovsk, Armenians including the entire Communist Party
and government leadership were taken hostage, Soviet television
said.
   Two helicopters were shot at with artillery. Highways and
railroads to Nagorno-Karabakh were blocked and shipments of food
and fuel were not reaching the district, Soviet TV said.
   It said four soldiers of the Interior Ministry, which is
responsible for internal security, had disappeared and a fifth was
killed.
   Tass said security troops and combat helicopters with
paratroopers were sent to Azerbaijan on Sunday. It did not say how
many troops were dispatched or how many were already stationed in
the republic.
   The Armenian-Azerbaijani dispute is the bloodiest of the many
ethnic conflicts facing President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who leads a
country of more than 100 nationalities.
   The last major rioting occurred in February 1988, when
Azerbaijanis attacked Armenians in the city of Sumgait, near Baku.
Thirty-two people died, most of them Armenians. More than 200 have
since been reported killed.

   ``Read My Lips! Give kids the right to vote!''
says Terry P., age 11, in a letter to President Bush. He adds
parenthetically: ``Give us at least two votes each. Then millions
of kids would vote and get interested in politics.''
   The letter was one of hundreds written by 6- to 13-year-olds at
the request of David Heller, a psychologist and author, for his
forthcoming book, ``Mr. President, Why Don't You Paint Your White
House Another Color!''
   Some letters that didn't make the book were printed in the
current Parents magazine, shortened but with original grammar,
spelling and punctuation intact.
   Jason, 9, wrote the president:
   ``I hope that you can stop all the wars. They go on too long and
many people die. Maybe you could try something different. You could
get on TV and scream as loud as you can for everybody to stop. That
would get all the other countrys attention. They'll hear it with
all the satelite dishes they got as spies. Hope it works.''
   Ivan, 10, not wanting the first lady overlooked, wrote:
   ``Dear Mrs. Bush, I figured I would write to you since you
probably get no mail. I want to tell you to keep up the good work
so that more people know how to read. I love to read, except for
science. Also say hello to your husband, George.''
   ``I want you to know that we have your picture up in our
classroom. Right next to Washington,'' Bobby, 9, wrote to Bush. ``I
wonder if I sent you a picture of me, maybe you could put it up in
your office?''
   ``I'd give less money to the real army and spend it on army
toys,'' said Mike, 8.
   ``Do you still get advice from President Reagan, or were you
glad to see him and Nancy Reagan move back to California?'' asked
Paige, 12.

   The homemade strawberry and blackberry wine
that Fairfax County Supervisor Gerald W. Hyland gave to fellow

   The wine was not properly aged and proved to be much more potent
that Hyland ever expected. A bottle given to County Executive J.
Hamilton Lambert exploded and made a mess of his wine rack.
   ``I smelled it, but I didn't get to taste it,'' Lambert laughed.
   A cork flew out of a bottle given to Verdia L. Haywood, deputy
county exeuctive for human services, while it sat on his kitchen

   Hyland joked that his wine could save him a trip to the state
capital to promote glass recycling.

   The Southwest fills up every winter with
snowbirds, people fleeing the cold and snow on the northern Plains,
but now North Dakota is attracting reverse snowbirds.
   Many are retirees seeking peace and quiet.
   At age 75, Robert Sampson said he looks 10 years younger than

Jean walk two miles in a half-hour inside the City Auditorium.
   In New York City, where they lived for 12 years, ``everybody
walked like we walk in this gym. Only they were looking over their
shoulder,'' Sampson said. The couple lived in the state for four
years in the 1970s and their daughter married a North Dakotan.
   North Dakota natives Eugene and Bertha Scherr spent 32 years in
Milwaukee before returning to Linton in 1988.
   ``Our intention always was to return to North Dakota because
this is home,'' Mrs. Scherr saib.
   Mrs. Scherr said she misses amenities like big-city shopping.
   ``But I'm getting better,'' she said. ``I crochet, sew and play
cards. Then, when there's not much else to do, I'll drive out in
the country and see all the wide-open spaces I hadn't seen in
years.''

   The nation's first elected black governor
was applauded today by former colleagues as he addressed the
state's budget crunch by saying he would resist new taxes and
deficit spending.
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder went to work after a weekend of inaugural
festivities, delivering his ``State of the Commonwealth'' message
to the legislature in which he once served.
   ``As one of the men we honor today, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
once observed, `The ultimate measure of a person is not where that
person stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he
stands at times of challenge,''' he said.
   In his first speech to the General Assembly, Wilder said he
would not support a general obligation bond issue this year to deal
with a projected $900 million revenue shortfall. He also said that
he would not support the repeal of a state sales tax on
non-prescription drugs at this time, even though he's supported it
in the past, because the state could not afford the loss of revenue.
   ``Although the day for this long-awaited repeal shall come, that
day is not yet upon us,'' he said.
   He got a long and loud round of applause when he was introduced,
and his speech was interrupted by applause several times, such as
when he called on officials to resist tax increases and proposed
drug testing and treatment for prison inmates.
   Earlier, in an interview, the governor said it ``certainly is
ironic'' that he was starting work on the day honoring the civil
rights leader.
   Wilder, speaking on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' said he
fought for years as a state senator for a Virginia holiday honoring
the slain civil rights leader.
   Though the King birthday is a holiday for state employees, it is
not for the legislature.
   On Sunday, Wilder, a guest on ABC's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' was asked if a black could be elected president ``in
our time.''
   ``Yes, if what you say is `our time' is the forseeable future,
yes, I do think there is a possibility,'' Wilder said.
   At his inauguration Saturday before more than 35,000 people
outside the state Capitol, Wilder said, ``Despite our economic
slowdown, we are living in the best of times. And they can be even
better. And they will be better.''
   Wilder, the grandson of slaves, also alluded to the history he
made by being elected governor in the former capital of the
Confederacy.
   ``We mark today not the victory of party or the accomplishments
of an individual, but the triumph of an idea,'' he said, ``the idea
that all men are created equally.''
   Wilder, a Democrat who turns 59 on Wednesday, took the oath of
office from retired U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.,
a Richmond native who headed the city's school board during the
turmoil over integrating public schools.
   Wilder's 15-minute inaugural address was interrupted by cheers
five times, once when he proclaimed ``freedom is meaningless when a
woman's right to choose is regulated outside the dictates of her
own faith and conscience.''
   Wilder's support of abortion rights was a prominent issue in his
fiercely fought campaign against Republican J. Marshall Coleman,
who opposes abortion. A recount showed that Coleman lost by 6,741
votes, or less than half a percent, in the closest race for
governor in the state's history.
   Before the inauguration, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and former
tennis star Arthur Ashe joined Wilder at a prayer service.
   Later, Muhammad Ali was among the crowd of about 12,500 at a
sold-out Inaugural Ball at the Richmond Coliseum. Tickets ranged
from $50 to $7,500 for some box seats.
   The high costs prompted at least one protest sign in the
inauguration crowd. It read, ``Is there a ball for Church Hill?'' _
a reference to the largely poor neighborhood in Richmond where
Wilder grew up.
   But most in the crowd said they were inspired by the historic
inauguration.
   ``The eyes of the nation are on Virginia,'' said Mildred Swann,
a social services worker in her 40s, who recalled how she evaded
the Ku Klu Klan as she tried to get fellow blacks in Mississippi to
register to vote in the early 1960s.
   ``For me to see something like this in my lifetime _ there's
some hope for the world,'' she said.
   When Wilder was introduced, she bowed her head and cried.

<HEAD>Ford Pay Strike Begins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 workers at three Ford Motor Co.
Ltd. plants began wildcat strikes Monday, and the automaker
responded by indefinitely laying off 1,000 workers who hadn't
walked out.
   Ford said more than 700 workers at its Bridgend engine plant in
South Wales put down their tools during the morning to protest the
company's 10.2 percent pay hike offer, bringing the plant to a
standstill.
   The 1,500 Bridgend workforce had already voted to hold a 24-hour
strike Wednesday when their unions were scheduled to resume
national contract negotiations with Ford.
   About 600 skilled maintenance workers at two assembly plants in
Halewood in northwest England also launched an indefinite strike
Monday, disrupting work, Ford said.
   Ford said the walkout forced it to lay off 1,000 workers in the
metal stamping and body plant at Halewood.
   ``We are extremely dismayed that Bridgend employees have taken
this strike action after we were assured by the trade union side
that no industrial action would be taken at least until Wednesday's
talks,'' a company spokesman.
   The walkouts follow the union leaders' rejection last Wednesday
of Ford's offer of a two-year deal with a 10.2 percent increase in
the first year and an increase of 7.5 percent, or the inflation
rate plus 2.5 percent, in the second year.
   Ford employs 32,000 workers at 22 British plants. It said the
majority of its workers earn an average $374 a week.

   Redoubt Volcano fussed and fumed quietly
Monday, and scientists planned to install new seismic sensors on
the peak's flanks, the Alaska Volcano Observatory reported.
   Late Sunday, the 10,197-foot volcano 115 miles southwest of
Anchorage was emitting a steam plume to about 14,500 feet, said
geologist C. Dan Miller. The plume contains little or no ash, and
seismic activity in and beneath the volcano remained low, he said.
   He said the observatory planned to put three crews on and near
the mountain Monday.
   One was to install two seismic sensors on the volcano's flanks,
the second was to survey sections of the Drift River Valley to look
at past mud flows to determine flooding hazards.
   A terminal for Cook Inlet oil is located at the mouth of the
Drift River.
   Redoubt has caused flooding in the Drift River several times
since it started erupting in mid-December. Federal scientists have
warned the state that Redoubt could cause a flood big enough to
carry large blocks of ice and rock crashing into oil storage tanks,
or wash out a buried oil pipeline.
   The third crew plans to investigate deposits left by eruptions
on Jan. 2 and Jan. 8, Miller said.

<HEAD>Mother, Baby to Be Freed After Jailing by Judge Known For Odd
Sentences</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-age mother jailed with her baby in a
shoplifting case will be freed, a court ruled Monday, reversing a
sentence imposed by a judge who said he wanted to deter women from
getting pregnant to avoid prison.
   Tracey Scott, a 19-year-old unmarried supermarket cashier, was
convicted for letting friends walk out of the supermarket with
goods they did not pay for. She pleaded guilty to 10 charges of
theft, and was sentenced by Northern Circuit Judge James Pickles to
six months in jail.
   She went to prison two weeks ago with her daughter, Alesha, then
10 weeks old _ a sentence that caused an uproar in Britain.
   Coming from Pickles, known nationwide for his quirky sentences,
the punishment was not entirely a surprise, however.
   In June, he drew controversy for jailing a witness who was too
frightened to testify against a man accused of beating her up.
   The day after putting Ms. Scott in prison, Pickles let off two
of the supermarket thieves with a sentence of 50 hours' community
service apiece.
   What should have been a routine shoplifting case has generated
editorials, angry letters to newspapers, discussion on radio
call-in shows and debate in Parliament.
   Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the highest legal official, signaled
his concern by immediately reviewing the case file. Members of
Parliament have voiced dismay, with the opposition Labor Party's
Barry Sheerman demanding that Mackay review Pickles' entire record.
   ``By making a lottery of the law, Judge Pickles treats the
public with contempt. He must not be allowed to continue,'' said
the tabloid newspaper Today.
   The Times of London said that ``Judge Pickles' decision again
needs questioning in this case.''
   Pickles maintained in his verdict that while he didn't suspect
Ms. Scott of getting pregnant to avoid going to prison, he was
afraid other women might get that idea.
   ``Would it be right,'' he asked, ``to let young women know that
one way of possibly or probably avoiding custody would be to
deliberately become pregnant between the time they have been
detected committing a crime and the time they were being
sentenced?''
   Lord Lane, the lord chief justice, clearly thought not.
Presiding at Monday's Court of Appeals hearing, he said Pickles'
reasoning had left a ``most unfortunate'' impression.
   The offense was not serious enough to warrant imprisonment, Lane
said. A high school dropout from a broken home, Ms. Scott had been
a good worker at the supermarket in Huddersfield, northern England,
and acted only to win popularity, he said.
   Pickles, the judge said, ``seems to us to have been concerned
more with the public import of what he was doing and saying, rather
than the justice of it.''
   Ms. Scott is in Styal Women's Prison in Cheshire, and will have
a hearing in London on Tuesday, when she will be formally released.
   Pickles, a judge since 1976, has flouted regulations by
discussing his actions in the news media frequently with a blunt,
populist tone.
   ``I don't like the notion of aristocracy or even monarchy. I
don't accept anyone is different from me because they were born in
a different bed,'' he told The Sunday Times in March.
   Last week, he vigorously defended the sentence for Ms. Scott,
telling a TV interviewer: ``A judge decides what's right, what's
just and what's fair, giving full reasons on both sides. And if
he's wrong, he's wrong.''
   Pickles, 64, insists he is humane _ he twice delayed sentencing
Ms. Scott until he was sure a place was available for her and the
baby in youth custody, where the regime is less strict.
   He has called for relaxing prostitution and drug laws, saying
they encourage crime. In January, he freed on probation a man who
had molested a 6-year-old girl. Pickles said the man would have
been picked on by bullies in prison and that the arrest and court
appearance likely would have a chastening effect.
   When he imprisoned Michelle Renshaw for seven days for contempt
of court over her refusal to testify against her attacker, several
lawmakers demanded his resignation.
   Pickles believes strongly in deterrent sentencing. When he
realized no reporters were covering that sentencing, he had one
summoned over the court public address system.

<HEAD>Permanent Security Council Members Told To Block Khmer Rouge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, convening a meeting
Monday on Cambodia, called on the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council to make sure the Khmer Rouge never returns to
power.
   Senior officials of the United States, the Soviet Union, China,
Britain and China met for two days of talks expected to focus on an
Australian plan calling for a U.N. force to take over Cambodia's
administration until free elections can be held.
   None of the warring factions have objected to the Australian
proposal, which could become the basis for direct peace
negotiations, said Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas. Alatas
spoke in Thailand on Monday after completing meetings with the
leaders of Vietnam, the Communist government of Cambodia and the
guerrilla factions.
   The French Foreign Ministry said Dumas told the Paris meeting
that the five permanent Security Council members ``have particular
responsibilities for maintaining peace, and some have important
influence on the protagonists'' in Cambodia.
   China is the chief supplier of the Communist Khmer Rouge, the
United States backs the non-Communist rebels, and the Soviet Union
supports the Vietnamese-installed government of Premier Hun Sen.
   Dumas said the meeting ``should seek by all means a solution to
allow an end to the murderous conflict tearing apart Cambodia that
prevents a return to power by the Khmer Rouge,'' the statement
reported.
   No report on the meeting's progress was expected before Tuesday
evening, after the representatives of the five countries meet again
with Dumas at the end of their discussions.
   Participating in the meeting are Deputy Foreign Minister Igor
Rogachev of the Soviet Union, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Solomon, Chinese Vice Minister Xu Dunxin, British Deputy
Foreign Minister David Gillmore, and the director for Asia in
France's Foreign Ministry, Claude Martin.
   After a visit to Beijing last week, Rogachev said the Soviet
Union and China agreed the United Nations should play ``a very
major role'' in a settlement, raising hopes that China would
pressure the Khmer Rouge to accept such a deal.
   Pressure for finding a settlement to the 11-year-old conflict
has been building with reports of Khmer Rouge advances in western
Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge army radio claimed Monday that many thousands of
people were fleeing Battambang, Cambodia's second-largest city,
after guerrilla attacks on government positions.
   The report could not be confirmed, and Western diplomats say the
Khmer Rouge often exaggerates the success of its attacks.
   Khmer Rouge forces also detonated plastic explosives in the
capital, Phnom Penh, on June 5-6. They also said they had forced
the Cambodian leadership to flee to Vietnam, a claim the government
denied.
   A peace conference on Cambodia last summer broke down over
proposals for a four-party interim government that would include
Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, which was responsible for hundreds of
thousands of deaths during its 3{-year rule.
   Vietnam chased the Khmer Rouge from power when it invaded in
late 1978.
   Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge guerrilla, refused to consider
Khmer Rouge participation. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of the
three-party resistance coalition, insisted on including them,
saying they would continue the war if kept out.
   Since Vietnam said it withdrew it last troops in September,
pressure has been growing on the United States, Britain and France
to switch at least some of their support from Sihanouk to Hun Sen
as the best means of preventing the Khmer Rouge from again gaining
power.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hearty Panamanian welcome for the
U.S. invaders surprised intellectuals and university students, who
are trying to figure out whether they belong to a nation or a
glorified American colony.
   ``Our generation does not believe in anything anymore,'' said
Ivonne Bruneau, a student at the University of Panama.
   The intellectual and political community is also trying to
figure out where the nationalist spirit went wrong.
   ``Nationalism was identified with support for a government'' _
the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, said Raul Leis, an
independent sociologist and political scientist.
   ``It was like someone grabbing a clean flag with dirty hands. If
you were a nationalist, you had to support Noriega; if you were
democratic, it meant you opposed Noriega and were not nationalist.
   ``Eventually we tended to identify `democratic' with the United
States, which opposed Noriega,'' Leis said.
   The U.S. soldiers who invaded Dec. 20 to oust Noriega were
cheered and embraced by Panamanian civilians, some of whom offered
them food and invited them to their homes for New Year's Eve.
   ``Go ahead and touch him,'' one mother told her young son,
pointing to a U.S. soldier in battle gear. ``It's like your GI Joe
(doll).''
   ``This is a honeymoon,'' said sociologist Marco Gandasegui,
director of the Center for Latin American Studies. ``But like all
honeymoons, it will end.''
   Ms. Bruneau said, ``The Americans did something we could not do
or were not prepared to do. To my generation, it was a good change
after more than 20 years of military government.''
   The United States is often referred to as Panama's midwife.
President Theodore Roosevelt engineered its separation from
Colombia in 1903, and in return obtained concessions that resulted
in construction of the Panama Canal.
   Until 1977, the United States had sovereign control over the
Canal Zone, a 10-mile-wide strip of land along the canal that
divided the country in two.
   Panama's national currency is the U.S. dollar. Nearly 35,000
Americans live here, and until July, more than 10,000 soldiers and
their dependents lived off base in Panama City.
   ``There has been a process of assimilation of Panama into U.S.
culture,'' said Cecilio Simmons, dean of the School of Public
Administration and member of the Democratic Revolutionary Party
that was created by Noriega's mentor, former dictator Omar Torrijos.
   ``There are sectors of the populations that would like to become
a protectorate of the United States. Our oligarchy is closely tied
economically to U.S. interests. Our professionals are attracted by
the so-called American way of life.''
   ``Then there are our own mistakes _ the corruption of the
previous regime, that twisted the meaning of nationalism,'' he
added.
   Nationalists struggled for decades to rid the country of the
Canal Zone, where they were treated as foreigners in their own
land. The process culminated with the signing of the Panama Canal
Treaties, under which the canal becomes Panamanian on Dec. 31, 1999.
   Noriega represented that strain of nationalism, but corrupted it
and grew weaker each day. In May elections, current President
Guillermo Endara beat Noriega's candidate by a 3-1 margin.
   Those who oppose the invasion are almost embarrassed that
Noriega's Defense Forces _ so vocal in their pledges to fight to
the death _ surrendered so easily. There were no casualties among
the higher officers.
   Leaders of many nationalist parties have gone into hiding and
are not making statements about the invasion.
   ``They are too concerned about their dollar accounts being
frozen if they say something,'' said one university professor
bitterly.
   Nevertheless, the first public sign of discontent came Jan. 9, a
holiday called Day of the Martyrs. It commemorates Panamanians who
died in anti-U.S. riots in 1964.
   While 8,000 gathered at a Mass to celebrate the overthrow of
Noriega and his surrender to U.S. authorities to face drug charges,
150 people staged a protest march to a cemetery where some of the
martyrs are buried. They said they did not support Noriega, but
they also did not support intervention.
   The appeal of economic aid to a country in a severe financial
crisis was also a factor in the favorable reaction, according to
some Panamanians.
   The fact that Endara's government was installed by a U.S.
invasion has not hurt him yet, but eventually may become a
liability.
   ``The United States will have to help considerably to maintain
the support of the people and help this government that has no
experience at all,'' said another university student, Luis Botello.
``If the promised help does not come through, the U.S. image will
suffer.''
   ``The time will come when the U.S. presence will begin to bother
people,'' Ms. Bruneau said.

   Two policemen injured when the brakes
failed on an ambulance operated by Mother Teresa's hospital
remained hospitalized Monday, doctors said.
   Two other pedestrians died after they were struck in Saturday's
accident.
   Doctors treating the two constables said on condition of
anonymity they were still under medical care but gave no other
details.
   Police initially reported that Mother Teresa was in the
ambulance when the accident occurred. But police and the
79-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner's fellow Roman Catholic nuns
said Sunday she was not in the vehicle.
   ``There was confusion because she reached the scene within
minutes,'' an officer said on condition of anonymity.
   The accident occurred on a busy street a few hundred yards from
the building where Mother Teresa lives. Several nuns wearing blue
and white saris identical to Mother Teresa's attire were in the
ambulance, adding to the confusion.
   The ambulance was carrying medical supplies but no patients when
the accident occurred.
   Police said its brakes failed and it struck two pedestrians who
had just stepped off the sidewalk into the street. The ambulance
then veered onto the sidewalk and struck the two constables,
according to the police reports.
   Mother Teresa accompanied the injured to a nearby hospital,
where two of them late died, the police report said.
   Mother Teresa, who was born in Yugoslavia, won the 1979 Nobel
Peace Prize for her work among Calcutta's destitute and dying. The
Missionaries of Charity, the Roman Catholic order she founded in
the city in 1959, has 3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.
   The frail nun suffered a heart attack in September and resumed
work last week. Members of her order said Sunday that Mother
Teresa's health was stable but that she was saddened by the deaths.

<HEAD>Navigation On Monongahela River To Resume By Wednesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navigation of the entire Monongahela
River should resume by Wednesday evening, 16 days after 62 runaway
barges wreaked havoc on the waterway, an Army Corps of Engineers
spokesman said Monday.
   Twenty-four miles of river between the Maxwell Locks and Dam
near Brownsville, and Dam No. 7 at Greensboro, has been closed for
a week so engineers could lower the water level to remove 34 barges
lodged at Maxwell.
   As of Monday, engineers were able to remove 10 barges and pieces
of two others, including a barge that sank under four other empty
barges and blocked Gate 2 at the Maxwell Locks, said Corps
spokesman John Reed.
   Restoration of the water level will begin Tuesday and should be
high enough for navigation by Wednesday night, he said.
   The 24 remaining barges, which are upstream of the Maxwell Dam,
do not interfere with navigation and should be removed by
mid-February, Reed said.
   The barges at Maxwell are from a group of 37 that broke away
from a coal processing plant. They were either empty or loaded with
coal.
   In all, 62 barges broke loose from their moorings along a
58-mile stretch of river Jan. 1 after ice jams melted and began
flowing downriver. More then 30 barges sank.

   The domed Canadian, the famous scenic train on
one of the world's longest rail lines, headed west Monday on its
last journey as part of large reductions in passenger service
nationwide.
   The transcontinental daily run was among 17 of 38 lines on the
VIA Rail passenger system that were eliminated after last-minute
court challenges failed.
   Chris Holloway, director of Transport 2000 Canada, a federation
that lobbies for improved transportation, said the cutbacks were
``devastating.''
   ``It's an emasculation of the service,'' he said.
   The reduction of about 50 percent in passenger train service was
announced in October as part of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
effort to trim the federal budget deficit.
   The government will reduce annual subsidies to VIA Rail from
$550 million in 1988 to $301 million by 1992. The reduced service
took effect Monday and the train system laid off 2,761 of its
employees, or about 38 percent of its workforce.
   Holloway, in an interview from Ottawa, said the government was
wrong in contending that not enough Canadians ride the trains to
justify continuing the subsidies at current levels.
   ``That's balderdash; that's simply not true,'' he said. ``No
national rail passenger service operates without a deficit.''
   About 450 protesters chanting ``Save the trains'' gathered
Sunday at Toronto's Union Station for the departure of the
Canadian, which will complete its last 2,700-mile trip Wednesday
when it arrives in Vancouver, British Columbia.
   Hundreds more participated in demonstrations in at least 10
other towns and cities, and the last passenger train run from
Sydney in Nova Scotia to Halifax was canceled because protesters
padlocked themselves to the locomotive.
   The elimination of the Canadian line touched off an emotional
debate that recalled the route's critical role in forging the
Canadian confederation in the 19th century.
   ``I think it's wrong _ it's going to hurt national unity,''
Julia Conley, 64, told protesters at Union Station in a voice
quavering with emotion.
   Two people were killed Sunday when the Canadian collided with a
pickup truck at a crossing in a residential area near Pembroke,
Ontario, about 60 miles west of Ottawa, police said. The train
resumed its run a short time later.
   ``It's quite a way to end it all,'' said conductor Don Green,
who is retiring after 34 years. ``I haven't seen something like
this in 15 or 20 years.''
   The Canadian has operated daily on a southern route that dated
more than a century and often includes the spectacular scenery of
the Canadian Rockies and prairies. The route is featured on
countless posters and postcards.
   A parallel northern route, called the Supercontinental, was
reduced from daily service to three times a week. VIA Rail will
rename that train the Canadian, although the route is considered
far less scenic than its counterpart.
   The VIA Rail cuts also affect a couple of regional routes, eight
remote ones and a major chunk of service along the populous
Montreal-Toronto corridor that extends to Quebec City and Windsor,
Ontario.

<HEAD>Crews Find 16 Bodies in Sunken Ferry, Death Toll Could Exceed 100</HEAD>

   Rescue crews Monday recovered a
ferry that sank with at least 150 people on board and found 16
bodies in the hull, the government said. News reports said the
final death toll may exceed 100.
   The Ajmeri, a single-deck wooden ferry, capsized Sunday after
colliding with another vessel on a river near the town of
Munshiganj, 20 miles southeast of Dhaka.
   The ferry had a licensed capacity of 60 passengers but the
government-owned Bangladesh Times said the vessel carried 300
people; the independent Ittefaq newspaper put the number at 150.
   Ittefaq said at least 50 people riding on the ferry's roof swam
to safety but that about 40 suffered injuries.
   Police divers called off the search for bodies at dusk Monday,
but hundreds of relatives of the missing thronged the river banks.
   ``Have you seen my husband?'' asked Ranu Ali, a middle-aged
woman, speaking to rescue workers. ``He was on the ferry.''
   When told her husband, Ahmed Ali, was not among the survivors,
she began sobbing.
   Local government officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said divers would resume the search at dawn Tuesday. But one
official said river currents had probably carried most of the
bodies away and that he doubted more would be found.
   The Ajmeri sank in 50 feet of water at the confluence of the
Dhaleswari and Shitalkhya, two of the hundreds of rivers that
crisscross the country.
   Shipping Minister Korbal Ali told Parliament the ferry was
brought to the surface about 15 hours after it capsized.
   ``Only 16 bodies have been found so far in the hull,'' Ali said.
He did not say how many people were aboard the ferry when it sank
or whether the death toll was expected to rise.
   River ferries are an important means of transport in Bangladesh
and crowding on the vessels has been compounded recently because a
transport strike has halted bus services.

<HEAD>Memo to Congress: To Get on TV, Run for President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television news pays a lot of attention to
members of Congress who run for president but ignores most of the
rest of them, a study says.
   For example, Democratic Rep. Richard Gephardt rated a few
mentions on the evening news for his congressional work on the
federal tax code _ including a hotly debated bill that bore his
name _ but it took his bid for the presidency in 1988 to make his
face and name familiar on TV.
   Likewise, Sens. Albert Gore Jr., Lloyd Bentsen, Paul Simon and
Dan Quayle found that mention on the three networks _ CBS, NBC and
ABC _ was the result of their political aspirations rather than the
nuts-and-bolts doings in Congress.
   ``As an everyday member of Congress, they might not ever be
mentioned,'' said the man behind the study, Joe S. Foote, a former
congressional staffer and now chairman of the radio-television
department at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.
   In 1987-88, the study found that 10 percent of the members of
the Senate accounted for nearly 50 percent of all network Senate
coverage. Less than 3 percent of the membership in the House made
up about 90 percent of the network House coverage during the same
two-year period.
   Quayle was not far from never-mentioned status as the junior
senator from Indiana in the 1985-86 session. He got just six
mentions on the nightly news.
   But that number skyrocketed to 172 in 1987-88, the congressional
session that included his election as vice president. Quayle wasn't
a formal candidate until George Bush made him one, but the pattern
was the same among Democratic presidential hopefuls:
   _Gephardt of Missouri, an unsuccessful Democratic presidential
candidate in 1988, was mentioned 25 times during 99th Congress of
1985-86. During the 100th Congress, he totaled 253 mentions _
meaning use of his name in a report, a film clip or an interview.
   _Gore of Tennessee rose from 27 mentions in 1985-86 to 209 in
1987-88.
   _Simon of Illinois rated 15 mentions in 1985-86, but 200 in
1987-88.
   _Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware was mentioned 35 times in
1985-86, then 104 in 1987-88.
   Foote based his study on the Television News Index and Abstracts
at the Vanderbilt University News Archive in Nashville, Tenn.,
which tracked mentions on the evening news programs of the three
networks. Cable News Network was not included.
   The senator mentioned most often on network television news was
Bob Dole of Kansas, who not only ran strongly against Bush for the
Republican presidential nomination but was his party's leader in
the Senate. Already well known, he had 276 mentions in 1985-86,
then 486 in 1987-88.
   Gore ranked second in the 100th Congress with 209 mentions,
Simon was third with 200 and Bentsen of Texas, the 1988 Democratic
vice presidential candidate, was fourth with 199. During 1985-86,
Bentsen had managed just 14 mentions.
   In this arena, at least, Bentsen edged out Quayle, who was fifth
among senators with his 172 mentions in 1987-88.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, was sixth with 155 mentions and Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., Senate majority leader at the time, was seventh with 144
mentions.
   At the bottom of the list with no mentions from 1987 to 1988
were Sens. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D.; Wendell Ford, D-Ky., and Harry
Reid, D-Nev.
   Gephardt led the list of House members with 253 mentions; former
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, was second with 196, and Jack
Kemp, the former New York congressman who was thwarted in his bid
for the GOP presidential nomination, was third with 193 mentions.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., co-chairman of the congressional
Iran-Contra committees, received 89 mentions in 1987-88. Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, was fifth
with 59 mentions.
   During that period, 44 percent of the House members were never
even mentioned on the nightly news programs.
   ``As the 1980s passed by, congressional backbenchers found it
was harder and harder to break into the national spotlight as
defined by ABC, CBS and NBC,'' Foote said.
   The result is that some of the newer and younger members of
Congress have ``fewer and fewer opportunities to influence public
opinion,'' Foote said. ``We rarely hear their ideas.''

<HEAD>Parliament Votes To Scrap Communists' Guaranteed Monopoly</HEAD>

   Parliament voted unanimously Monday to
abolish the Communist Party's monopoly on power, opening the way to
free elections, and it reaffirmed the abolition of harsh
restrictions on the ethnic Turkish minority.
   National Assembly deputies agreed to remove constitutional
clauses, as other Soviet bloc countries have done, that for 40
years enshrined the party as ``the guiding force in society and the
state.''
   Foreign Minister Boyko Dimitrov told reporters if was ``a first
step, but a very important, symbolic step. ... You shouldn't move
forward toward democracy by banning other parties.''
   Alexander Dimitrov, a deputy, said in the debate: ``We should
not forget that there is no Socialist and no bourgeois democracy.
There is either democracy or there isn't.''
   Fledgling opposition groups, loosely allied in what they call
the Union of Democratic Forces, were to begin negotiations with the
Communists on Tuesday about further reforms and the elections
tentatively scheduled for May.
   About 200 people shouting ``Down with the Communists''
demonstrated outside Parliament on Monday, supporting opposition
demands for their own offices and a newspaper. Petar Beron, an
opposition spokesman, insisted the demands be settled before the
negotiations started.
   More than 50,000 people held a rally in freezing temperatures
Sunday to press opposition demands for two-stage legislative
elections that would give non-Communists a chance to organize.
   They also called for removal of a constitutional clause defining
Bulgaria as ``a socialist state ... headed by the working class.''
   Parliament postponed action on those demands. Andrei Lukanov
said a special committee should be named to draft changes in that
and about 25 other constitutional articles by the end of February.
   Such amendments are needed to hold free elections, but Lukanov
said adoption of a new constitution should be left to the new
Parliament. He is second in the leadership to Petar Mladenov, who
became president and party chief after Stalinist leader Todor
Zhivkov's downfall in November.
   Lukanov said he favored removing the reference to the leadership
of the working class because no class should be privileged. He also
said, however, that the party has popular support and Bulgaria
should remain Communist.
   ``As a parliament, we can't decide such a fundamental question .
.. on the basis of a one-hour debate,'' he said. ``Only the people
can decide this,'' in a referendum.
   Under Mladenov and Lukanov, the Communists clearly hope to use
their long dominance to preserve the standing lost by their
comrades in Poland, Hungary East Germany, Czechoslovakia and
Romania.
   Like other East Europeans, ``we want democracy ... without some
kind of preconditions,'' Lukanov said, but added: ``We believe in
socialism, despite some deformations. ... We will fight for that
and think it's our historic task to do so.''
   Opposition was crushed or strictly controlled by Zhivkov, who
was forced out Nov. 10 after 35 years in power.
   In debate Monday, deputies stridently condemned the Zhivkov
years and calmly voted to overturn the one-party rule that provided
their own power and privilege.
   A deputy who did not identify himself declared: ``If the working
class really had that leading role, it would never have permitted
our prisons and camps to be crowded by thousands of peasants, our
brothers and fathers.''
   Mikhail Genovsky, an elderly member of the Bulgarian Agrarian
Party, the only other political party Zhivkov permitted, said:
``The blood that has been shed, we cannot forget.''
   ``Todor Zhivkov said we could have only 120,000 members,'' he
said. ``We had to ask local Communist Party officials for
permission for every new member.''
   On the ethnic question, Parliament approved a declaration
adopted by a broad forum of Communists, opposition and ethnic
leaders last week supporting the decision to restore language,
religious and educational rights to the 1.2 million ethnic Turks,
most of whom are Moslems.
   Many Bulgarian nationalists opposed a decision by the leadership
Dec. 29 to restore the rights abolished in 1985 after an
assimilation campaign that forced ethnic Turks to take Bulgarian
names.
   Last week's compromise endorsed the decision but also said
Bulgarian is the official language in this nation of we oarian is
the official language and affirmed Bulgaria's ``territorial
integrity.''
   Parliament gave approval in principle Monday to amnesty for
about 8,500 prisoners, including two dozen ethnic Turks jailed for
defending their minority rights.
   It would be the third amnesty since Zhivkov fell. Vasil
Mrachkov, the former prosecutor-general, told the deputies 60
ethnic Turks were included in the first two.

<HEAD>Banks Announce Plan to Increase Minority Access to Banking
Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Community leaders and banking officials unveiled a
$1 billion plan Monday to increase the availabilty of loans,
mortgages and construction funds to minority communities across the
state.
   The Massachusetts Bankers Association is ``a permanent working
relationship that will have a profound impact on this city and this
state's ability to grow and develop,'' said Boston City Councilor
Bruce Bolling.
   Studies by the Federal Reserve found that more mortgages were
issued in white Boston neighborhoods than in black ones.
   The plan follows nine months of negotiation between bankers and
representatives of minority neighborhoods in Boston and the state's
other major cities.
   ``What we discovered in the process was that there was an awful
lot we bankers didn't know about the reality of the inner city,''
said Richard Pollard, chairman of the MBA and BayBank Boston. ``And
what the community leaders realized was that there was a lot they
didn't realize about the reality of banking.''
   The program will include a loan consortium to finance affordable
housing developments, create a financing pool for small business
and economic development in low-income minority neighborhoods, and
increase bank investment in minority neighborhoods.
   Willie Jones, head of the Community Investment Coalition, said
the banks could have glossed over bias in lending institutions by
simply throwing money at the problem. He credited them with instead
establishing a program that could help low-income families for the
next two decades.
   ``We have the confidence that the banks are stepping to the mark
to address the problems facing our community,'' he said.
   The MBA said half of its plan will be financed by banks based in
Boston and that eventually 100 banks will participate. Specific
commitments were to be unveiled later in the week.
   The statewide plan will not include a pool of money for
mortgages at interest rates below going market rates. Boston
bankers agreed to provide $30 million for such mortgages in the
city.
   The plan includes:
   _A $100 million loan program for affordable housing development.
   _A $100 million mortgage program for neighborhoods targeted for
revitalization.
   _Establishment of the Massachusetts Bankers Minority Enterprise
Investment Corporation.

<HEAD>Wilder Issues Plea for Fiscal Conservatism, Proposes Reserve Fund</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-King Day Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY O'DELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder called for fiscal
conservatism Monday in his first ``State of the Commonwealth''
speech as the nation's first black governor.
   Wilder delivered the speech on Martin Luther King Day to the
legislature he once served, and from which he pushed for the state
holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader. The state faces a
$900 million deficit for 1990-92.
   Wilder, who was sworn in Saturday, said his cautious approach to
dealing with an economic slowdown brought to mind the words of King.
   ``As one of the men we honor today ... once observed, `The
ultimate measure of a person is not where that person stands in
moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of
challenge,''' Wilder told the state's General Assembly.
   Wilder urged the General Assembly to resist tax increases and
promised to trim the state budget enough to establish a reserve
fund. He said he would not seek a sales tax exemption on
non-prescription drugs _ a measure he has long favored _ and would
not support use of general obligation bonds for state projects this
year.
   On social issues, Wilder said he would convene conferences on
rural development and the drug problem. He called for drug testing
and treatment for prison inmates and supported the death penalty
for drug-related murders.
   Wilder's 24-minute speech, which was interrupted by applause
nine times, drew generally favorable reviews from the
Democratic-controlled General Assembly.
   ``Some of the conservatives in this state should be turning
backflips over this speech,'' said House Majority Leader Thomas W.
Moss Jr. of Norfolk.
   ``It's the best Republican speech I've ever heard spoken by a
Democrat,'' said Sen. Joseph B. Benedetti, a Richmond Republican.
   Wilder did not give a specific figure for his proposed reserve
fund and did not say where he would find the money as the General
Assembly wrestles with a projected $900 million revenue shortfall
in the 1990-92 budget.
   Wilder told reporters after the speech that he would present his
proposed budget amendments by Friday.
   ``A biennial budget is a budget for two years _ not for one,''
Wilder told lawmakers. ``And I think the time has come for us to
practice that in fact as well as in theory.''
   Twice during the 1980s, Wilder said, the state ended a fiscal
year with no reserve for appropriation in the second year of the
biennium. He said the $25.8 billion, two-year budget proposed by
former Gov. Gerald L. Baliles falls $200 million short of providing
enough money for salary increases for teachers and state employees
in the second year.
   Wilder drew applause early in his speech when he relayed his
first principle of fiscal discipline: ``We should resist the urge
to enact general tax increases.''

<HEAD>Infiniti Ads Spark Oldsmobile Parody</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You've seen the commercials, the ones showing
pastoral scenes of waves, fields and forest, with a man's soothing
voice asking existential questions about eternity and values.
   Although no car is ever seen, most viewers know it's a
commercial for the Japanese luxury car Infiniti _ except in New
England, where not all is as it appears.
   A series of advertisements that ran from Christmas Eve to Jan. 2
parodying the Infiniti spots has had New Englanders talking,
laughing and watching.
   ``Questions. What are we for? Why am I here?'' asks a voice
narrating one of the parodic spots, as the camera fixes on a still
forest scene. The voice continues: ``especially when Oldsmobile is
having a great sale right now.''
   The camera cuts to a plug from an Oldsmobile spokesman, a few
shots of cars, and the theme song ``This is not your father's
Oldsmobile,'' used in Olds national advertising.
   When the scene returns to the forest, the voice asks: ``What is
a factory-to-dealer incentive anyway?'' It trails off, wondering:
``How much wood could a woodchuck chuck, if a woodchuck could
chuck...''
   The commercials mimic the Infiniti spots almost exactly. Even
the voice, that of a professional, sounds like the copywriter who
laid down the track for Infiniti.
   ``Somebody had to do it,'' said Ron Lawner, executive vice
president, creative director at the Boston office of the New
York-based Della Femina McNamee-WCRS Inc., where the commercials
were made. Lawner said many people called his office commending the
series, which advertised an Oldsmobile holiday sale for a regional
dealers' association.
   ``The nature of the content was supposed to be provoking, to get
them talked about, when everybody is having the same sale,'' Lawner
said.
   To the makers of the Infiniti ad, imitation is the best form of
flattery.
   ``I think it's a terrific parody. They did a terrific job of
playing around with our ad,'' said Chuck Kushell, executive vice
president, general manager at Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos,
Inc. Advertising in Los Angeles, where the Infiniti ads were made.
   Sidney Zussman, president of The New England Oldsmobile Dealers
and owner of West Street Motors in Methuen, said his group loved
the ads.
   ``People came in the door saying `I saw your ad and it's the
funniest thing we've seen yet,' and hopefully they're in a better
mood to purchase a car,'' Zussman said.
   The parodies, which cost ``in excess of a quarter of a million
dollars,'' helped Oldsmobile sales in New England, up 25 percent
during holiday markdowns, Zussman said.
   The Infiniti ads cost about $600,000 to produce, Kushell said.
   Oldsmobiles range from $17,000 to $25,000, while Infinitis range
from $23,500 to $38,000.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Launches D.C. Statehood Drive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, declaring that statehood for
the District of Columbia was a ``mainstream'' issue, launched a new
effort Monday to gain the district's admittance to the union.
   ``D.C. statehood is a mainstream issue,'' Jackson said. ``We
need to go to work ... mobilizing people all over the country. We
want democracy and not tyranny.''
   Jackson said the campaign, which began on the national holiday
honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King, ``would give
substance to the dream'' that King espoused.
   Jackson, who moved to the district last year, was joined at the
opening of the Rainbow Coalition's D.C. Statehood office by local
and national politicans, local labor leaders and mayoral hopeful
Sharon Pratt Dixon.
   The campaign will focus on persuading those who voted for
Jackson in the 1988 Democratic presidential primaries to rally
behind the statehood effort, the two-time presidential hopeful said.
   Roughly 7 million voters backed Jackson in the primaries.
   The civil rights leader said he has already met with Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley
to push the statehood issue. He said statehood supporters will
write to each member of Congress and senator by Feb. 1 to determine
who supports the idea.
   The Republican and Democratic parties will also be asked to
help, and Jackson expressed confidence that he will be able to meet
with President Bush to discuss the statehood issue.
   ``Surely, if he can send our men and women to fight and die for
democracy in Panama, he will not deny democracy where he lives,''
Jackson said. ``If Mr. Bush can stand for Puerto Rican statehood,
surely he can stand for D.C. statehood, too.''
   In his State of the Union address last January, Bush promised to
have party officials explore the possibility of making Puerto Rico
a state.
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown, a former
Jackson aide and D.C. resident, noted that statehood for the
nation's capital was a plank in the 1988 Democratic platform.
   ``We'll be behind it,'' said Brown. ``We will be putting our
resources behind this _ mostly organizational help.''
   Jackson has been rumored as a possible mayoral candidate, but
has publicly said he would not oppose Mayor Marion Barry in the
upcoming election.
   Barry indicated he may include funds for two ``shadow'' senators
and a ``shadow'' representative in the budget he will send to the
city council next month. Those elected to the largely ceremonial,
non-voting positions would lobby for statehood in Congress.
   The district currently has one, non-voting delegate to the House
of Representatives.

<TEXT>
   Scottish actor Gordon Jackson, known to television
viewers around the world as the crotchety butler Hudson in the TV
series ``Upstairs Downstairs,'' died after a brief illness, his
agent said Monday. He was 66.
   Jackson died Sunday at Cromwell Hospital in London with his
wife, Rona, at his side, agent Michael Anderson said. No cause of
death was given.
   Jackson's long career in about 60 films made his face and
gentle, rolling Scots accent familiar to two generations of
moviegoers, but it was his lead role in ``Upstairs, Downstairs''
that brought the widest fame.
   As Hudson, the tall, ginger-haired actor presided over the often
chaotic ``downstairs'' servants' world with a stern hand but soft
heart; his old-fashioned sense of duty and propriety was a bulwark
to the aristocratic Bellamy family ``upstairs'' during the times of
changing values before, during and immediately after World War I.
   He was made an OBE, or officer of the Order of the British
Empire, in 1979 for his services to the theater and films.
   He won a British Actor of the Year award in 1974 and an American
Emmy award in 1976 for his work in the series, which was filmed
from 1970 to 1975 and constantly is on reruns.
   In the Australian TV miniseries ``A Town Like Alice'' _ also
shown to U.S. audiences on the ``Masterpiece Theater'' program _
Jackson played Mr. Strachan, the British lawyer who helped a young
client make a life for herself after her release from Japanese
captors in World War II.
   Jackson was born in Glasgow in 1923 and had begun an
apprenticeship with Rolls Royce in Edinburgh, but turned to acting
as a teen-ager, with no formal training. His rueful expression
first typecast him as a coward and a weakling, but maturity brought
him more interesting roles.
   His first professional acting job came in 1941. He played a
Scottish soldier in the film ``The Foreman Went to France,'' the
story of Britons trapped in France in 1940 by the German invasion.
   His film credits included ``Whisky Galore,'' the 1948 film shown
in the United States as ``Tight Little Island'' about the efforts
of Scottish islanders to hide a salvaged cargo of whisky from the
authorities during wartime rationing.
   He appeared in ``Tunes of Glory'' (1960), ``Mutiny on the
Bounty'' (1961), `The Great Escape'' (1962), ``The Prime of Miss
Jean Brodie'' (1968), and ``The Shooting Party'' (1984).
   From 1977 to 1981, Jackson also played the tough undercover
police chief Cowley in the British TV thriller series ``The
Professionals'' and was in the 1988 TV movie ``Noble House.''
   On stage, he played a host of Shakespearean characters in
London's West End.
   Actor Tom Conti said: ``Gordon Jackson was one of the very few
actors I have ever met who hated to talk about himself.
   ``For all the recognition he enjoyed from his early days in
movies ... he remained modest and unassuming. He was a man honest
and decent of the most generous spirit.''
   Actress Pauline Collins, who played a housemaid in Hudson's
``downstairs'' territory, said: ``Since the day I first met him 20
years ago Gordon has been the most loving, laughing and giving
friend of my life.
   ``He was an actor of huge generosity of spirit and always the
central heart of any company he graced.''
   Her husband and co-star, John Alderton, said: ``Gordon was the
sweetest, gentlest man I have ever met. ... All those millions
worldwide who loved his work will feel his loss no less than those
who had the great good fortune to have known him.''
   Jackson once said of himself: ``My trouble is that I'm
underconfident and I'm too tentative. I'm not a go-getter and I
never have been.
   ``It's only when the curtain goes up and the cameras start to
roll that I don't enjoy this business.''
   Besides his wife, he is survived by two sons.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced, but a
memorial service was expected.

<HEAD>Shamir: Israel Must Keep Occupied Lands For Growing Jewish
Population</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Monday that
Israel must keep the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the heart
of the Middle East conflict, to settle Jewish emigres from the
Soviet Union.
   His suggestion renewed the country's debate over trading land
for peace and raised fears among Palestinians.
   Up to 300,000 Soviet Jews are expected to move to Israel over
the next three years.
   ``For a large immigration we need the Land of Israel, a large
and strong Israel,'' Shamir said. ``We will need a lot of place to
absorb everybody.''
   The statement, made Sunday night before a group of old-timers
from Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc in Tel Aviv, was broadcast
Monday on Israel radio.
   Likud members and other hard-liners use the term ``Land of
Israel'' in references to the Jewish state and the occupied
territories, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Middle East war.
   Hard-liners view the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as an integral
part of the nation and have recently begun suggesting that
territories serve as homes for Soviet immigrants. They have long
argued that Israel keep the lands for biblical and security reasons.
   Shamir came under immediate attack from the left-leaning Labor
Party, his partner in Israel's coalition government and an advocate
of trading some of the occupied land for peace.
   ``I do believe that a great Israel is an Israel that lives in
peace, not ... in conflict,'' said Finance Minister Shimon Peres,
leader of Labor Party. ``A great immigration needs a great Israel,
and to have a great immigration we need an Israel that has the
greatness of peace.''
   Now, about 70,000 Jewish settlers live amid about 1.7 million
Palestinians in the occupied lands.
   Palestinians have waged a 25-month revolt against Israeli rule
in the occupied territories and have demanded an independent
homeland.
   Palestinian analysts say part of the anxiety stems from
potential competition for jobs held by about 120,000 Palestinians
in Israel.
   ``I'm afraid that we're not only talking about jobs but about
taking over our lands, resources,'' Palestinian activist Saeb
Erekat said in an interview. ``The immigrants will be taking over
the future of the Palestinians and not only their jobs.''
   Calls for settling Soviet immigrants in the occupied territories
also have raised tensions with foreign fund-raisers and the U.S.
administration, which has repeatedly said that Jewish settlements
in the occupied lands are an obstacle to peace.
   Israel expects about 50,000 Soviet Jews this year, and officials
predict up to 300,000 could arrive over the next three years.
   They are seeking at least $350 million in donations from
American Jews to help cover the costs of settling immigrants and
have asked the U.S. government to guarantee $500 million in housing
loans.
   The Jerusalem Post reported Monday that Israel may also ask for
a one-time U.S. government grant of $500 million for resettlement,
in addition to the annual $3 billion in U.S. military and economic
aid.
   The White House had said it would not assist any resettlement
projects in the West Bank and Gaza, and the quasi-governmental
Jewish Agency, an institution that helps handle new arrivals, says
it will not funnel Jewish donations to the occupied lands.
   Last year, about 12,000 Soviet Jews immigrated to Israel,
joining 250,000 Soviets who have settled in Israel since the late
1960s.
   Settlement activists say 380 immigrant families moved to the
occupied lands in 1989 and their goal is to settle 500 more new
families, mostly Soviet immigrants, this year.

<TEXT>
   A new superintendent took over the nation's
third-largest school system Monday, promising to make it a national
model of public education.
   Ted Kimbrough assumes control of a system that has a
double-digit dropout rate, low standarized test scores and what
some critics say are bureaucrats fighting a reform effort aimed at
improving it. Much is expected of him.
   At a ceremony for winners of a student essay contest honoring
Martin Luther King Jr., Kimbrough declined to outline an agenda,
but said he is committed to working with a key element of the
reform _ 540 councils made up of parents, teachers and principals
that were elected in October with the power to hire and fire
principals, spend money and develop school improvement plans.
   But he said for the councils to work they must must be
resourceful and act on their own, and if they don't, ``Then I don't
think (reform) will work.''
   Despite the warning, he said, ``Public education here in Chicago
probably will set a model for ... public education in the rest of
the country.''
   Kimbrough also faces low employee moral at the school board,

decentralize the bureaucracy. A possible $51 million deficit in the
1990-91 budget and an interim board that will be replaced in May by

<HEAD>Democratic Leader Says Blacks, Jews Must Work Together</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ron Brown, chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, told an audience of blacks and Jews Monday that they
must ensure their relationship does not deteriorate despite honest
differences.
   ``Differences that can anger and even enrage cannot be allowed
to divide us,'' Brown told an observance at the Israeli Embassy of
Martin Luther King's birthday. ``We must realize that the
differences between our communities are not recognized by David
Duke and the Ku Klux Klan; that race hatred and religious
persecution walk hand-in-hand,'' he said.
   Duke is a former Klan leader serving in the Lousiana
Legislature. He has ties to neo-Nazi groups and is president of the
National Association for the Advancement of White People.
   Brown, the first black to be elected to the Democratic Party's
chairmanship, was the featured speaker at the fifth commemorative
observance held at the embassy.
   He said that just as King took his message outside his church
and into the streets, ``We must leave behind this gathering of
elites, and carry a message to those in our communities who are not
here _ the poor and disaffected, the uneducated, the prejudiced and
the angry people who search for targets and scapegoats.
   ``That message is this: it is not Jews that have bombed and
threatened civil rights leaders, and it is not blacks who are
painting swastikas on synagogues,'' Brown said. ``We do not
threaten one another.''
   He recalled for the audience that Jews and blacks ``stood
together for justice, sat at lunch counters, rode in buses across
the south, marked on Washington, picketed, organized and voted
together.
   ``Two-thirds of the whites who went to Mississippi for freedom
summer, two-thirds of those students who put their lives on the
line, two-thirds were Jewish,'' said Brown.
   Moshe Arad, the Israel ambassador to the United States, said
there was a unique bond between King's ``deep faith and ardent
commitment'' and the dteachings and values of Judaism.
   ``Perhaps that is why so many Jews flocked to his banner, and
enlisted in his cause, and supported his movement,'' Arad said.
   ``We in Israel, no less than the Jews of America, have long
cherished Dr. King,'' the ambassador said.

<HEAD>Leader: Estonian Communists Not Ready to Split from Soviet Party</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Lithuania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Estonia's Communist Party
said Monday that his group was not ready to split from the Soviet
Communist Party, at least until a party conference in October.
   ``Really a lot will depend on the October party conference. We
are political pragmatists in the sense that everything that is
useful we shall use, that which is harmful we shall throw out,''
the party chief, Vaino Valjas, told a news conference in Helsinki.
   ``Splitting (from the Soviet Communist Party) is not an aim in
itself,'' Valjas said.
   Valjas refused to comment on recent secessionist trends in
Lithuania and said Lithuanian leaders should answer such questions.
   Later, in a speech to Finland's leading foreign policy forum,
the Paasikivi Society, Valjas said his party would have to
``realize itself as a parliamentary party.''
   ``If it wants to retain its influential position in society it
must be actively involved in the democratic developments and in
carrying out perestroika,'' Valjas said.
   He criticized Soviet economic leaders for ``wrong methods of
leadership ... and ignoring market economy laws.''
   ``The negative developments are continuing. Work is inefficient
and financial difficulties are increasing. The crisis phenomena
have piled up over a long time,'' he said.
   Valjas said Estonia would continue to seek economic
independence. He welcomed foreign aid and cooperation with overseas
businesses.
   Valjas met with President Mauno Koivisto Monday on the second
day of an unofficial week-long visit at the invitation of the
Paasikivi Society.

   Officials of the Ceausescu regime,
members of the dictator's family and officers of the security
police will be charged with genocide, murder and undermining the
economy, the government said Monday.
   Previously, it has said accusations that they committed and
abetted such crimes were being investigated, but not that charges
would be filed.
   Dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who ruled Romania for 24 years and
put many members of his family in powerful positions, was
overthrown Dec. 22 by a popular uprising supported by the army. He
and his wife Elena, the second most powerful person in the country,
were executed three days later.
   Chief prosecutor Gheorghe Robu said Monday investigations had
been slowed, in part, because ``major problems arose in the writing
of statements, since many of the ex-officials can hardly write,
even though a good part of them held a doctorate in science.''
   The ruling National Salvation Front, which took over after
Ceausescu fell, also said Monday it would make the final choice of
a date for free elections, after consulting with all opposition
parties.
   Opposition groups have urged that elections, planned for April,
be delayed so they can have more time to organize.
   Dragos Munteanu, a spokesman for the Front, told a news
conference Monday he believed parliamentary elections should be
held as soon as possible, but added that a delay was possible.
   Among those scheduled for trial this week is Ceausescu's playboy
son Nicu, who was Communist Party boss of Sibiu, a city in
Transylvania, Robu said in an interview carried by the official
news agency Rompress.
   No dates or locations were given for any of the trials.
   The genocide charge refers to those Romanians killed by
Ceausescu's special Securitate police during the revolution, and to
victims of his regime. Undermining the economy relates to hardships
caused by the decision to pay off the foreign debt of $11 billion
from 1982 to last year, at the cost of severe shortages at home.
   Amnesty was announced Monday for crimes committed before the
Ceausescu was ousted. It excluded former functionaries, murderers,
rapists and terrorists, which has become the common term for
Securitate members.
   Trials of 11 Securitate members are to begin Friday in
Timisoara, where the revolution began a week before Ceausescu was
overthrown, Rompress said.
   Over the weekend, police in Timisoara said the trials would
start Monday. There was no explanation of the delay.
   Munteanu, the government spokesman, told reporters the fact that
the Communist Party was banned Friday and made legal again Saturday
showed the need for quick elections.
   He said the confusion was the result of inexperience, and
declared: ``When I speak about learning democracy, even the
government has to learn it. We don't have real statesmen and
politicians. They have to learn.''
   A referendum will be held Jan. 28 on whether to outlaw both the
party and capital punishment, which was abolished after the
Ceausescus were executed.
   At his news conference, Munteanu defended Dimitri Mazilu, vice
president of the provisional government, against opposition demands
that he be removed because of alleged former connections with the
Securitate.
   Even if Mazilu had been a Securitate officer at the beginning of
the Ceausescu regime, Munteanu said, ``conversions happen.''
   ``For the last five years he has been an outstanding spokesman
against Ceausescu's regime,'' he told the reporters.
   Visitors from the United States, West Germany and Britain met
with Romanian officials Monday.
   Rep. Chester G. Atkins, a Democrat from Massachussetts, said he
would propose hearings on restoring Most Favored Nation status to
Romania. The trading advantage was granted because of Ceausescu's
independent stance in the Soviet bloc, but withdrawn two years ago
because of human rights violations.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush took advantage of a holiday and
mild temperatures to get in 18 holes of winter golf Monday, but the
outing ended on a sour note.
   Bush got at least a quadruple bogey on the last hole.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, National Security Adviser
Brent Scowcroft and Fred Zeder, head of the Overseas Private
Investment Corp., joined the president on the 3{-hour tour around
the Andrews AFB links.
   On the par 4 18th hole, Bush's fourth shot landed in a bunker
short of the green. He blasted out of the sand trap, sailing the
ball over the green and up a hill where reporters were clustered.
   ``Oh, a little downhill. A little backspin downhill,'' said the
president.
   ``All you do on a shot like this is keep your head down and
plant your feet firmly,'' said Bush, explaining his technique.
   He swung hard, and the ball jiggled forward about six inches.
   On his second swing it sailed over the pin, to the far edge of
the green.
   ``That says it all,'' said Bush, marching off and picking up the
ball without bothering to hole out. He needed to sink a 15-foot
putt to escape with an 8 on the final hole.
   ``Don't use profanity. Do not pay off in front of the cameras,''
Bush advised Zeder as they walked off the course within range of
microphones and cameras.
   But it was not Zeder but Bush's partner, Scowcroft, who was
doing the paying off, pealing several bills out of his wallet and
handing them to Zeder before they left the course.
   No one divulged the final tally.
   Bush spent most of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend at
Camp David, the presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains of
Maryland, before flying to Andrews by helicopter to play golf under
sunny skies and a temperature of 57 degrees. As the sun set, his
Marine One helicopter returned him to the White House.

   Debt-swamped Campeau Corp. of Canada sought
refuge in bankruptcy court for its U.S. department stores Monday,
keeping open famous chains such as Bloomingdale's, Lazarus and
Rich's while struggling to reorganize.
   The filing for Chapter 11 protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Cincinnati was the biggest ever by a retailing business, affecting
258 department stores that employ 100,000 people and are visited by
millions of consumers nationwide.
   Officials of Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp. quickly sought to reassure customers, employees
and merchandise suppliers that business would go on as usual. They
said all regular customer services, such as credit card sales and
merchandise returns, would continue, as would payments to suppliers
and employees.
   ``The big problem is corporate, not in the stores,'' said Anne
Berg, a spokeswoman for Federated's Atlanta-based Rich's chain. ``I
think the public will understand. The problem is not with Rich's;
we're solvent.''
   The filing reflected Campeau's problems paying the
multibillion-dollar debt accumulated in acquiring Allied in 1986
and Federated in 1988, two of the biggest retailing industry
takeovers of the decade.
   Even before Monday, Campeau was planning a restructring that
would enable it to pay debts, and was negotiating with creditor
banks over billions of dollars in loans coming due.
   Under Chapter 11, the companies get a reprieve from creditor
bills and can continue operations while reorganizing their
finances. All business decisions regarding the companies must be
approved by Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr., who took the case.
   Bankruptcy protection should benefit Campeau's stores by
allowing retailers to concentrate on sales rather than the parent
company's financial difficulties, John W. Burden III, chairman and
chief executive of Federated and Allied, and James M. Zimmerman,
president and chief operating officer of the companies, said in a
statement.
   ``At the same time, under Chapter 11 protection, corporate
management will have the necessary time to aggressively address the
problems that exist at the corporate level with the burdensome
capital structure that precipitated today's actions,'' the
statement said.
   Federated and Allied also announced Monday that they had
negotiated agreements in principle with bank syndicates for
financing to cover cash needs, including $400 million for Federated
and $300 million for Allied. Both deals are subject to approval by
the syndicates and by the court.
   On New York City's Upper East Side, Bloomingdale's trendy
flagship store took the unusual step of opening 10 minutes late so
employees could hear the announcement of the filing over store
intercoms.
   Business otherwise appeared normal, except for reporters
interviewing customers outside the front door. ``We're trying to
keep a lid on it,'' said Bloomingdale's spokeswoman Katie Locke.
   Some Campeau stores quickly put signs on merchandising floors or
took out full-page ads in local newspapers to reassure customers.
   At Federated's Cincinnati-based Lazarus store group, which
operates 43 stores in five states, employees were told by letter
that they would be paid on schedule and that the company would make
good on any corporate checks workers had trouble getting cashed,
said Lazarus chairman Mark Cohen.
   Cohen said he called suppliers Monday to assure them the company
intends to continue business as usual.
   ``Everyone I talked to has been positive and upbeat,'' he told a
news conference.
   Numerous suppliers contacted Campeau Monday, and said they
wanted to resume shipping merchandise as soon as possible to
stores, Campeau spokeswoman Carol Sanger said in Cincinnati. She
declined to identify the suppliers.
   Jockey International _ the hosiery, underwear and sportswear
maker _ issued a statement saying it wanted to continue supplying
merchandise to the Federated-Allied stores, mainly to avoid
inconveniencing its own customers.
   The decision to file for Chapter 11 protection was made late
Sunday by the boards of Campeau, which is based in Toronto, and the
Cincinnati-based Federated and Allied units.
   Federated already was trying to sell the Bloomingdale's chain as
part of a restructuring effort. Burden and Zimmerman said the
company would continue entertaining bids for Bloomingdale's.
   Cohen said the reorganization could take months or years.
   Analysts have said a Chapter 11 filing could benefit Federated
and Allied by reassuring suppliers they would get paid if they
continued shipping merchandise. Suppliers would receive precedence
over many other creditors.
   On Sunday, Campeau said it had won a five-day reprieve from a
group of banks on a Monday deadline for deciding whether the
company was in default on a $2.34 billion loan arrangement. The
banks, led by Citibank, earlier had granted a two-week extension.
   Last Thursday, Campeau announced a restructuring under which
U.S. retailing businesses will be separated from the parent company
and run independently and in which company founder Robert Campeau
was removed from involvment in retailing.
   The bankruptcy court, which was closed in observance of the
Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, opened at Campeau's request to
accept the Chapter 11 filing, then closed again, the company said.
   Allied owns the Jordan Marsh, The Bon Marche, Maas Brothers and
Stern's department stores. Besides Bloomingdale's, Federated owns
the Burdine's, Lazarus, Abraham &amp; Straus and Rich's chains.
   Campeau also owns Ralphs, a Los Angeles-based southern
California supermarket chain spun off from Federated. Ralphs'
business operations are unaffected by the Allied and Federated
Chapter 11 filings, Campeau Corp. said.

<HEAD>Amnesty Says Hundreds of Unarmed Civilians Killed in Liberia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of unarmed civilians have been killed by
rebels and government troops in northeast Liberia, Amnesty
International said Monday.
   The human rights organization called on the Liberian government
to halt the ``extrajudicial'' executions by the soldiers and hold
an inquiry into the killings.
   Liberian Justice Minister Jenkins Scott confirmed last week that
the army killed civilians while hunting for dissidents who crossed
into the Nimba region from neighboring Ivory Coast in an attempt to
overthrow President Samuel K. Doe.
   But he said the soldiers were acting in self-defense against
people in civilian clothes who attacked them.
   Doe, who came to power in a violent 1980 coup, said the rebels
killed more than 200 unarmed civilians in the two weeks after they
entered Nimba on Dec. 24 before his forces brought the situation
under control. According to the Liberian authorities, about 16
Liberian officials were also killed after the rebels attacked the
villages of Butuo and Karnplay near the border.
   Africa Watch, a Washington-based human rights group, said
Liberian soldiers killed at least 200 civilians after the attempted
coup. Scott gave no figures on the number of civilians killed by
the army.
   Amnesty International gave no exact figure on the number of
civilian deaths by the rebels or military, except to say hundreds
had been killed.
   It quoted refugees and other unofficial sources as reporting
that the rebels destroyed villages and killed dozens of civilians.
Once government forces retaliated, it said, the army burned
villages and killed large numbers of unarmed civilians unconnected
with the rebels.
   The chief of Butuo, who fled to the Ivory Coast, claimed that
armed forces sent to recapture the village burned it down and shot
to death the village commissioner, David Boley, and his wife on
Dec. 29, Amnesty International said.
   The chief, who was not identified, claimed he and the Boleys
were questioned about the rebels, stripped and shot as they lay on
the ground, the rights group said. The chief survived because he
was left for dead.
   Amnesty International said as many as 20,000 refugees had fled
from Nimba to the Ivory Coast and Guinea. Ivorian President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny said about 8,000 to 10,000 people had entered his
country this month.
   Following a previous coup attempt in November 1985, Amnesty
International said hundreds of civilians were killed by government
forces in the Nimba region. Several opposition leaders, including
Robert Phillips, were detained in Monrovia.
   Phillips, who was subsequently acquitted of assisting the coup
attempt in a treason trial, was one of several people murdered in
recent weeks in Monrovia, apparently by unidentified men searching
for rebels and suspected of being members of the security forces,
Amnesty International said.

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said Monday security
forces in Hong Kong have beaten Vietnamese boat people and the
British colony's government forced some to return home despite
their ``genuine fear of persecution.''
   A report by the human rights group, which is based in London,
urged the Hong Kong government to stop forcible return of
Vietnamese to their Communist homeland.
   The Hong Kong government called the report unfounded and said it
was committed to the forced repatriation policy.
   In London, the Foreign Office said: ``We reject these
allegations. ... We will not send any genuine refugees back. Any
allegations of ill treatment will be fully investigated.''
   Amnesty accused the Hong Kong government of mistreating the
first 51 boat people forcibly returned, who were sent back to
Vietnam in December.
   It quoted witnesses as saying security forces dragged them from
the Chi Ma Wan detention center in a raid Oct. 31, using kicks,
beatings and choke holds.
   Hong Kong's secretary of security, Geoffrey Barnes, said ``a
minimum of necessary force was used on that occasion.''
   ``There is no truth whatsoever in the accusation that people at
Chi Ma Wan were ill-treated or rendered unconscious,'' he said.
   The refugees were then taken to another detention center, the
Phoenix House. Early Dec. 12, hundreds of security forces in riot
gear brought them to the international airport.
   During that operation, reporters did not see any evidence of
brutality.
   The report also charged the government with stopping
investigations of official misconduct in the camps, citing two
incidents when 200 boat people were allegedly beaten and kicked by
security forces last year. In one detention center, it said, unruly
boat people are routinely locked in empty subdivided cargo
containers for several days.
   The report said many Vietnamese feared that if they spoke up
about abuses, they faced ``possible retribution by the police and
risked unfavorable treatment in the screening process.''
   Amnesty International criticized the screening process to
separate refugees with the right to find a new country from
``economic migrants,'' who will be forced back to Vietnam.
   ``The fundamental rights of people who face a genuine risk of
persecution are being violated,'' the report said.
   Of the 40,000 Vietnamese awaiting screening, an estimated 85
percent face forced repatriation. They make up the bulk of boat
people who arrived after June 1988, when Hong Kong stopped
automatically granting refugee status.
   Under the screening process, boat people are given a hearing
with an immigration officer. They can appeal the decision once.
   As of Tuesday, 7,567 Vietnamese had been refused refugee status,
and 1,889 had lost appeals. So far, 997 have voluntarily returned
to Vietnam.
   Amnesty International said that during the screening process,
boat people receive no legal advice and are often interviewed by
immigration officers with scant knowledge of the human rights
situation in Vietnam.
   One case involved a young Vietnamese who was refused refugee
status even though he allegedly was fleeing a five-year term of
``political imprisonment'' in Vietnam.
   An emergency intervention of the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees provided the man refugee status.
   However, Barnes defended the screening process, saying Hong Kong
has given the ``benefit of the doubt'' to many refugees.
   But he said the colony would proceed with forced repatriation.
   ``It would be wrong and cannot be humane to leave them in
detention indefinitely,'' he said.
   Vietnam has promised not to prosecute or mistreat the boat
people for fleeing their homeland. But the Amnesty International
report said it fears that local officials may persecute those who
return.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of East Germans stormed
secret police headquarters Monday, tore up offices and hurled
furniture from windows in a raid state television said put
democratic reforms ``in gravest danger.''
   Another television report Monday night said a citizens'
committee and officers of the regular police sealed off the
headquarters after the protest ended.
   Also Monday, chief prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph said he
planned treason indictments of Erich Honecker, 77, the Stalinist
leader forced out three months ago, and Erich Mielke, 82, head of
his secret police.
   State television said the situation got ``out of control'' at
the headquarters of the once-dreaded secret police agency. ADN, the
official news agency, said ``several people brought bricks with
them.''
   ``The democracy that is just now developing is in the gravest
danger,'' the television said in a warning repeated throughout the
evening.
   Hans Modrow, the Communist premier, rushed to the building in
East Berlin's Lichtenberg section but was met with catcalls and
whistles when he tried to address the crowd.
   ``You were not elected by the people!'' the crowd shouted when
Modrow called for restraint and warned against violence.
   The Rev. Rainer Eppelmann, an opposition leader, said he
regretted the violence, but called the storming an ``alarm signal''
for the government.
   ADN said ``tens of thousands'' of people stormed the building.
Television spoke of 100,000.
   Official media said about 500,000 East Germans demonstrated
against the Communists and secret police in at least a dozen more
cities.
   About 150,000 people staged a noisy anti-Communist protest in
the opposition hotbed of Leipzig. They also chanted ``Germany
United Fatherland!'' and dozens waved West German flags.
   Another 150,000 rallied in Karl-Marx-Stadt, and 150,000 more
took to the streets in Dresden, ADN said.
   Protests were also reported in Potsdam, Erfurt, Schwerin,
Rostock, Halle, Cottbus, Neubrandenburg, Stralsund, Magdeburg and
Frankfurt an der Oder.
   In Cottbus, about 50 people broke from the main group of several
thousand protesters and clashed with police guarding secret police
headquarters there, ADN said. The protesters threw stones and broke
windows in the building before police dispersed them, the agency
said.
   Thousands of workers staged politically motivated warning
strikes in East Berlin, Gera, Jena and Zwickau.
   Protesters in East Berlin shouted ``We are the people! We are
the people!'' as they rushed into the secret police building.
Witnesses said they scattered documents and looted wine, food and
clothing from storerooms and closets.
   The protesters filled stairways with papers, ripped out drawers
from offices and broke windows. Several ripped down a picture of
Honecker and trampled it.
   About 60 police on hand at the time did not try to stop them,
according to the reports.
   Witnesses saw some looting, but many in the crowd also appeared
calm and good-natured as they milled through the headquarters.
   The protesters dispersed by late evening.
   The agency is being dismantled, and it was not clear how many
people were working at the headquarters Monday.
   No one was reported hurt, but the West German TV network ZDF
quoted unidentified East German officials as saying protesters
``threatened workers.'' Demonstrators smashed glass doors to enter
the building, witnesses said. The New Forum pro-democracy group had
originally organized Monday's protests and had repeatedly called
for demonstrators to avoid violence.
   The seventh weekly negotiating session between the Communist
Party and opposition, where the government official assigned to
dissolve the agency had made a report, was suspended after the
attack.
   The indictment of Honecker and Mielke would be the most drastic
action to date against leaders of the disgraced regime that ruled
for 18 years.
   High treason carries a maximum penalty of death in
``exceptionally grave cases'' and a minimum of 10 years in prison.
   The two are among 30 former leaders being investigated for
corruption, abuse of office and other serious offenses.
   Honecker is recovering from surgery for a malignant kidney tumor.
   Since his downfall, East Germans have demanded those guilty of
abuses be punished.
   Modrow promised Monday to open secret police files and give the
opposition a greater consultative role in the government. He
appealed for an end to warning strikes.
   Manfred Sauer, the official assigned to dismantle the secret
police, dominated Monday's meeting with the most comprehensive
disclosure yet about the secret police.
   He said one of every 80 East Germans had worked for the agency
or supplied it with information, and that 3,200 employees were
assigned to tapping telephones and opening mail.
   Sauer said the state security apparatus cost about $2 billion to
run last year _ about 1.3 percent of the national budget.
   Honecker expanded the secret police, he said, and by the end of
the 1980s there were 85,000 agents and 109,000 steady informants in
a country of 16.3 million people.
   Sauer told the meeting ``all directives against dissidents were
stopped by the government ... on Nov. 29.''
   He said 30,000 agents were fired, new jobs would be found for
22,500 and 20,000 would be dismissed ``within the shortest time
possible.'' He said those remaining would be needed to dismantle
the agency.

   Hundreds of Azerbaijanis and Armenians fought with
submachine guns, helicopters and armored vehicles as brutal ethnic
strife that claimed at least 37 lives raged in the Soviet Caucasus,
official reports said Monday.
   Facing the most violent flareup in the ethnic conflict since he
became Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Soviet Presidium
declared a state of emergency Monday night in Azerbaijan's disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh region and in nearby areas of Azerbaijan and the
neighboring republic of Armenia.
   Horrified Tass reporters wrote people were burned alive
overnight as attacks against Armenians continued in Baku,
Azerbaijan's capital. ``Again the blood of innoncent people was
spilled,'' they said.
   Monday night's decree means Red Army units and KGB troops now
will be used to protect residents of the strife-torn area and vital
installations like railroads, the official Tass news agency said.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told Norwegian radio earlier
that army units would be sent if needed to keep the conflict from
growing into civil war.
   The Kremlin sent high-level troubleshooters and more internal
security troops to the mountain region 1,240 miles southeast of
Moscow to try to end the fighting. It was the worst combat
involving predominantly Moslem Azerbaijanis and the mostly
Christian Armenians since their long-simmering territorial feud
boiled over nearly two years ago.
   Tass said Armenians and Azerbaijanis with submachine guns were
waging ``open armed clashes' in Azerbaijan's Khanlar region, near
Nagorno-Karabakh. In the nearby Shaumyansky region, 300 gunmen
fought in a single battle, Soviet TV news said.
   A soldier told the broadcast Azerbaijanis attacked an Armenian
village to set a farm on fire, but the Armenians fought back with
hunting rifles and assault rifles in a 1{-hour firefight. Four
Azerbaijanis were killed, he said.
   Tass said Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian district of
Azerbaijan, ``looks like a front-line zone today. Trenches are
being dug in villages ... self-defense posts being reinforced.'' It
said ``terrorists'' with hand grenades and machine guns were
coverging on the Azerbaijani village of Adzhikend, and that
artillery guns used to break up hailstorms were brought in to shoot
at helicopters.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said the belligerents were
using helicopters without markings and armored vehicles captured
from military bases.
   The violence, which exploded Saturday night with an
anti-Armenian riot in the oil-producing center of Baku, is
``reminiscent of news from the warfront'' in World War II, Soviet
TV commentator Igor Kudrin said grimly.
   Izvestia said at least 33 people had died the past three days in
anti-Armenian rampages in Baku, a city of 1.7 million, but that the
figure could rise as other ransacked apartments were inspected.
   Attacks on the homes of Armenians were continuing, with more
killings, Soviet TV said. It said 34 people, mostly Armenians, had
been injured.
   ``Last night in Baku was as horrible as the previous one,'' Tass
special correspondents N. Demidov and V. Gondusov wrote from the
city on the Caspian Sea. ``Once again, the fires of pogroms burned.
Again the blood of innocent people was spilled.''
   They said people, presumably Armenians, had been burned alive in
front of Baku's railway station.
   Less than 20 yards from a police station, ``like ugly black
dolls, two blackened bodies were cast on a trash heap,'' the Tass
reporters said.
   The Azerbaijani Communist Party tried to issue condolences to
relatives of riot victims, but the Kommunist printing works in Baku
wouldn't print them, saying sympathy should also be expressed for
Azerbaijanis whose family members died at the hands of Armenians,
according to Interfax, a news service of Radio Moscow.
   Two ferries evacuated about 660 Armenians, mostly women and
children, from Baku across the Caspian to Krasnovodsk, a city in
the republic of Turkmenia, Soviet TV said. They were flown to
Yerevan, Armenia's capital, aboard two Tupolev-154 jetliners, said
Karen Shakhbazyan, an Armenian activist in the city.
   About 20,000 ethnic Armenians, most of them elderly, live in
Baku, although the ethnic violence the last two years has caused a
return of Azerbaijanis and Armenians to their home republics.
   ``Armenia is in a state of battle readiness,'' Shakhbazyan
reported from Yerevan. He said 200,000 people rallied Monday on
Theater Square and that at least 100 armed police massed at the
airport hoping to fly helicopters to Azerbaijan to defend Armenians
there.
   Shakhbazyan said businesses in Yerevan formed ``defense
committees'' of volunteers. In Leninakan, a city hit hard by the
1988 earthquake, 10 machine guns and 100 assault rifles were seized
from an Interior Ministry troops detachment, he said.
   Tass reported Armenian fighters had taken hostages in the
Azerbaijani city of Gyandzha, and Izvestia said unidentified people
broke into an agricultural institute and grabbed 80 automatic
weapons, two machine guns, a mortar and 27 bayonets kept for
students' military training.
   In Shaumyanovsk, Armenians including the entire Communist Party
and government leadership were taken hostage, Soviet TV said.
   The Kremlin dispatched Yevgeny M. Primakov, a non-voting member
of the ruling Politburo and chairman of one of the two chambers of
the Supreme Soviet legislature, to Baku, and Nikolai N. Slyunkov, a
full Politburo member, to Yerevan.
   Previous attempts by Moscow, including placing Nagorno-Karabakh
under its direct administration, failed. The mainly Armenian
enclave of 160,000 people has been controlled by Azerbaijan since
1923, but now wants to be part of Armenia.
   The state of emergency declared Monday also empowers local
officials to ban demonstrations and strikes, impose curfews, censor
the media, confiscate weapons and disband unofficial organizations.
   Moscow-based correspondents were told Monday by Foreign Ministry
officials they would not be permitted to travel to Azerbaijan or
Armenia.
   Reinforcements of Interior Ministry troops and combat
helicopters carrying paratroopers were dispatched to Azerbaijan
Sunday, Tass said. It did not give figures.
   Troops arriving at the airport in Kirovabad, an Azerbaijani city
with a large Armenian population, could not move out because the
road were blocked by civilians and hundreds of cars and trucks,
Tass said.
   In Baku ``supplies to the troops are being sabotaged,'' it said.
When convoys of security forces tried to move closer to the
Azerbaijani capital, a signal rocket was fired by Azerbaijani
militants, bringing crowds onto the road who blocked it until they
were pushed aside, Tass said.
   According to Izvestia, not a single railroad train reached
Armenia through Azerbaijan Monday as the rail blockade renewed last
week by Azerbaijan to press its demands for sovereignty over
Nagorno-Karabakh continued.
   A total of 224 trains are immobilized on Azerbaijani territory
and 109 more have no locomotives to move them, Izvestia said.
Armenia depends heavily on rail supplies via Azerbaijan, and
Shakhbazyan said fuel was running short in Yerevan because of the
blockade.
   For the fifth straight day, Interfax said, no freight cars
carrying goods or fuel entered Stepanakert, the administrative
center of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Since Gorbachev became Soviet leader in March 1985, his greater
tolerance for dissent has encouraged many Soviet ethnic groups to
make demands they long suppressed. That has often led to violent
conflict in the nation of more than 100 nationalities, many of whom
harbor age-old grudges.
   The last major rioting sparked by the Nagorno-Karabakh feud was
in February 1988 when Azerbaijanis attacked Armenians in Sumgait,
near Baku. Thirty-two people died, most of them Armenians. More
than 200 have since been reported killed.

   Protesters who tore up the secret police
offices Monday used the scornful nickname Stasi for the agency they
equate with the Nazi Gestapo, and some toasted each other with
champagne stolen from its storerooms.
   ``Stasi out and into the factories!'' they chanted. ``The people
are here now!''
   Stasi is a shortened form of Staatssicherheit, the agency's
proper name, which means ``state security'' in German.
   Tens of thousands of East Germans stormed the building at about
5:30 p.m. Monday, releasing pent-up anger against the force that
cracked down on dissent for four decades. East German television
said 100,000 took part.
   They ranged in age from teen-agers to people in their 50s and
some who appeared older.
   Some spray-painted slogans on the walls. ``Stasi _ Gestapo _ KGB
_ Securitate _ Bloodsuckers,'' read one that associated the East
German agency with its Nazi, Soviet and Romanian equivalents.
   No injuries were reported and some raiders appeared in a nearly
festive mood.
   State television said ``the offices had virtually not been
functioning any more'' because the agency was being disbanded. How
many employees were in the building was not known.
   Thousands roved through the building, throwing furniture from
windows and scattering documents grabbed from filing cabinets.
   One group found a portrait of Erich Honecker, the 77-year-old
Stalinist who ran the country for 18 years until October. They tore
it off the wall and stomped on it.
   At least one West German flag was seen being carried through the
halls.
   About 60 police were on the scene, but did not interfere. One
smoked casually as he watched the mayhem.
   Honecker used the secret police to spy on citizens, crack down
on dissent and intimidate opponents of the Communist government.
They had wide powers and sent thousands of political prisoners to
jail.
   Dismantling of the agency has been a major opposition demand,
and the government says it is accomplishing the task.
   The pro-democracy group New Forum organized as protest of the
secret police for Monday, but had urged demonstrators to avoid
violence.
   Hans Modrow, the Communist premier, tried to address the
protesters and finally managed to be heard despite loud whistling.
When he finished his appeal, about an hour after trouble began, the
raiders began to disperse.

   A holdup attempt went awry Monday when an
explosive that robbers used to blast open a safe went off
prematurely, injuring 44 people in a crowded post office, police
said.
   Among the wounded were retirees lining up to receive their
monthly pension payments, police said.
   The payments had just began when at least three people armed
with rifles and pistols rushed into the post office, fired shots in
the air and shouted, ``This is a robbery!'' police said.
   The robbers planned to use the bomb to blast open a safe where
more than $500,000 had been deposited for the payments, Police
Chief Luciano Cannarozzo said.
   But the bomb went off early, apparently injuring one of the
bandits, Cannarozzo said. The blast knocked down a wall and buried
most of the money. At least 44 people were hospitalized, police
said.
   The bandits escaped in two cars, police said. Because most of
the money was buried in the blast, the haul was believed to be
total only a few thousand dollars.

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Gen. Julio Velasquez said
Monday he has offered to resign because of the assassination of the
former defense minister last week in a Lima parking lot.
   Governnment sources said President Alan Garcia, who met Sunday
at Government House with Velasquez, refused to accept the
resignation.
   The former minister, Enrique Lopez Albujar, was the most
prominent victim in Peru's 10-year-old guerrilla war. Officials
blame Tuesday's slaying on Shining Path rebels, who have brought
their battle against the government from the Andean highlands where
they originated to the nation's capital.
   The pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement also claimed
responsibility for the slaying, but counterinsurgency experts
continue to believe the Shining Path is responsible because of the
manner in which the assassination occurred.
   Lopez Albujar was killed Jan. 9 when at least four leftist
terrorists shot him with sub-machine guns and pistols as he arrived
alone in his car at the office where he worked following his
retirement last year from the armed forces.
   He was alone because his driver and a bodyguard arrived late to
work that day.
   Velasquez said he presented a letter of resignation Friday to
Garcia because he considered himself ``politically responsible''
because it was his ministry's duty to insure Lopez Albujar's safety.
   ``Official sources said that President Garcia is not willing to
accept the decision of the defense minister,'' La Republica
newspaper reported earlier Monday.
   Lopez Albujar was army commander in 1987 when Garcia named him
as Peru's first defense minister, a cabinet post created to
consolidate authority over the three armed forces. He retired in
May and was replaced by Velasquez.
   Garcia last week publicly criticized the failure to provide
sufficent protection to Lopez Albujar but said people who could be
terrorist targets should also take precautions.
   More than 17,000 people have died in Peru's political violence
since the Shining Path launched its guerrilla war in May 1980. The
Tupac Amaru band, a much smaller group, took up arms in 1984.

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS graf 6: ``The area,'' to note citrus areas not
covered</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush declared portions of Florida a
major disaster area Monday from the pre-Christmas freeze that
devastated citrus and other crops.
   He signed the disaster declaration before leaving Camp David to
spend the rest of his Martin Luther King Day holiday golfing at
Andrews Air Force Base.
   John Herrick, a White House spokesman, said the disaster
declaration covers the counties of Broward, Collier, Dade, Hendry,
Lee, Monroe and Palm Beach.
   It makes those left jobless by the disaster eligible for
unemployment compensation and other federal assistance.
   The freeze struck Dec. 23, with portions of Florida getting snow
for the first time in years.
   The area concerned in Monday's declaration is most of southern
Florida, mostly a vegetable-growing area. Gov. Bob Martinez, who
said he was ``very pleased,'' said he would ask for similar help
for citrus areas in central and northern Florida once the extent of
damage there has been documented.
   The White House said federal aid will be coordinated by Thomas
P. Credle of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Atlanta
office.
   Bush himself visited Orlando, Fla., Jan. 8 and promised farmers
at the American Farm Bureau convention that they would not be left
alone in recovering from the freeze.
   Bush went golfing with Secretary of State James Baker III,
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Fred Zeder, president
of the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and a longtime Bush friend.

<TEXT>
   The closure of the only Soviet facility
capable of destroying chemical weapons is jeopardizing plans to
eliminate superpower stocks of those arms and prompting suggestions
the United States provide newly developed technology to accomplish
the task.
   ``We could do ourselves and the human race an awful lot of good
if we would offer this to the Soviets,'' said Rep. Larry Hopkins,
R-Ky., who made the suggestion to Secretary of State James A. Baker
III and Soviet Defense Minister Gen. Dmitri T. Yazov.
   The State Department ``has let this thing slide'' Hopkins said
in a telephone interview Friday. He is the only Westerner to have
visited the Soviet facility, 550 miles southwest of Moscow, and
wrote the law requiring the United States to destroy 80 percent of
its chemical weapons by 1997.
   An administration official, speaking on condition he not be
further identified, said the offer was made to the Soviets, that
they made no response, and there was ``no activity'' on the issue.
   The facility was shut down before it even began operations after
demonstrations by environmentalists and the little-publicized
development has left the Soviets without the means of destroying
their chemical weapons.
   The superpowers are trying to negotiate a bilateral chemical
weapons treaty by the end of the year, and this month U.S. and
Soviet officials exchanged what they call ``base-line'' data on
their stockpiles and production plants. The data remains
classified, said an administration source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Exchange of the information was part of a superpower deal cut
last September with the aim of lending momentum to talks among 40
nations for a global convention banning production of chemical arms.
   The global ban faces many obstacles, however, and the
superpowers still are debating whether to destroy their entire
stockpiles, as proposed by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, or to leave them at about 6,000 tons apiece, as
proposed by President Bush. Both proposals were made at the United
Nations last September.
   ``We do not believe that they are able right now to destroy the
amount they claim to have, which is 50,000 tons,'' Sheila Buckley,
the top Pentagon chemical arms negotiator, said in a recent speech.
   ``We may be able to share some of that technology with the
Soviets, if they are interested. It is not clear yet that they
are,'' she said.
   In March, the U.S. Army plans to begin testing a disposal
facility on Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean about 800 miles
southwest of Hawaii.
   The facility will burn the substances at 2,700 degrees
Fahrenheit. If it works as planned, the Army will build similar
plants to destroy the rest of the U.S. chemical arsenal, stored in
eight states: Maryland, Kentucky, Alabama, Utah, Indiana, Oregon,
Arkansas and Colorado. Construction started last September at the
Tooele Army Depot in Utah, where 42.3 percent of the U.S. stocks
are stored.
   U.S. chemical weapons stockpiles are estimated at 30,000 tons by
private analysts, and administration sources said that number was
``in the ballpark.''
   At Chapayevsk, the Soviets planned to destroy two chemicals also
in the U.S. arsenal, the nerve agents Sarin and VX, by mixing them
with caustic agents and then burning the residue.
   U.S. officials used similar methods to destroy 3,250 tons of
mustard agents in 1974-75 at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, near
Denver, but discarded the technology because it left large
quantities of toxic waste, said Col. Walter L. Busbee, head of the
U.S. chemical weapons disposal program.
   While the United States burns its older weapons, dating from
1969 or before, it is making a smaller quantity of newer weapons
that would also be destroyed if a global convention goes into
effect.
   Although the Soviets have closed their only disposal facility,
Kremlin spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said last Sept. 18 that other
plants would be built. No new construction has been announced, and
it could take years.
   Hopkins, in a letter last September to Baker, said ``it is clear
that they will now have to begin rebuilding a disposal capability
from scratch.''
   That could mean ``a three- to five-year setback in the Soviet
effort,'' he said. ``Without outside assistance, it is very
possible the USSR simply might be technically incapable of meeting
the required disposal schedule under negotiation.''
   A non-government expert on the issue, Elisa D. Harris, said that
``unless we help them build a facility with proper containment, it
may be several years before they can start meeting their
commitments under a bilateral accord.... It does seem to me that
the people who helped come up with the president's proposal in
September must have been aware of the problems that the two sides
confront.''

<HEAD>Economic Decline Must Halt Within a Year: Soviet Official</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Soviet official said Monday
that economic reforms in his country must succeed within a year or
``the leadership's credit with the population will vanish.''
   Leonid Abalkin, a vice premier and the Soviet's top economic
reform official, told reporters here, ``If the situation on the
consumer market does not stabilize before the end of the year,
other pretenders will try and seize power.''
   Abalkin, who began a two-day private visit to the Netherlands,
did not identify those thought to be waiting in the wings to unseat
the reform-minded faction in the Soviet leadership.
   Speaking through a Dutch interpreter, he warned that ``those who
repeat the mistakes of the past years will not be able to play a
vanguard role in the reform process any more.''
   Referring to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet
official added, ``If there are great troubles with the economy, if
goods disappear from the stores, a leader will lose his influence
with the population.''
   Abalkin said that ``regrettably, many mistakes have been made
recently,'' citing errors or delays in the field of tax reform, and
management and planning system changes.
   A radical plan to overhaul the ruined Soviet economy into a
market-oriented system _ a plan Abalkin helped co-author _ failed
to be adopted by Gorbachev's government late last year.
   Instead, a five-year economic plan submitted to the Supreme
Soviet, the nation's working parliament, relied heavily on central
planning, now held to be one of the major stumbling blocks to
meaningful economic reform.
   Abalkin said that the strongly watered-down reform program was
``the product of compromises and consensus. ... I think it's a
great victory that it has been achieved in such difficult times.''
   He warned however that ``this plan must not remain another paper
project, there must be real changes in the economy.
   ``If this government thinks that that is impossible, it should
no longer take responsibility in the face of the parliament and the
people,'' Abalkin said.

   Egypt's foreign minister left for Washington
early Wednesday seeking a way to resolve differences by Israel and
the PLO that continue to block Middle East peace talks.
   The unexpected trip by Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid comes
after two visits to Cairo in a week by Yasser Arafat, the Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman.
   Abdel-Meguid told reporters at Cairo International Airport he is
carrying a message to President Bush from President Hosni Mubarak,
who has been trying to start a dialogue between Arafat's
organization and Israel.
   He did not elaborate except to say he would exchange views with
U.S. officials on the situation in the Middle East.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday that Abdel-Meguid and
other senior officials, including Osama el-Baz, director of
Mubarak's political office, ``are going to try and push forward
Middle East peace efforts'' with U.S. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   Israel has repeatedly declined to meet with the PLO leadership,
saying it is an organization bent on destroying the Jewish homeland.

<TEXT>
   The Catholic church and leaders of
Colombia's three biggest political parties urged drug traffickers
Monday to end their terrorism here and suggested they could get
lenient treatment from the government.
   A communique signed by two cardinals and the political leaders
was the first sign Colombia is being worn down in the bloody war
against traffickers and may be leaning toward a negotiated
settlement between the drug lords and the government of President
Virgilio Barco.
   It came as Colombia prepared for President Bush to attend a drug
war strategy meeting with Latin leaders Feb. 15 in the coastal city
of Cartagena.
   Meanwhile in the small northwestern town of Pueblo Bello, gunmen
forced 31 people into a dump truck and kidnapped them, national
police said Monday.
   A wave of abductions, apparently by drug traffickers, has swept
Colombia, but Gov. Elena Herran de Montoya of Antioquia state said
police told her Sunday's mass kidnapping was the work of a leftist
guerrilla group, the People's Liberation Army.
   Monday's plea for an end to terrorism was signed by cardinals
Mario Revollo Bravo and Alfonso Lopez Trujillo, and by former
President Julio Cesar Turbay, head of the governing Liberal Party;
former President Misael Pastrana, head of the Conservative Party,
and Diego Montana Cuellar, leader of the Marxist Patriotic Union
Party.
   Drug traffickers would ``get less rigorous treatment than if
they insist in their criminal ways,'' they said, urging traffickers
to stop their violence and release people kidnapped in the last two
months.
   Barco's office refused to comment, but it would be unlikely such
a communique would be signed by the leader of his Liberal Party
without his approval.
   His government began a crackdown on drug traffickers last Aug.
18 when they killed a leading presidential candidate, Carlos Galan.
   The government extradited 11 suspected traffickers to the United
States and killed the second-ranking member of the Medellin cocaine
cartel, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha.
   The traffickers responded with 262 terrorist acts that killed
209 people and injured 1,243, including bombing a Colombian
airliner and secret police headquarters.
   The latest kidnappings brought to 85 the number of people
abducted in the last 45 days, the Department of Administrative
Security _ Colombia's secret police _ said in a news release
Monday. Kidnap victims included a congressman, ranchers,
businessmen and Diego Montoya, son of Barco's general secretary.
   In a broadcast interview with the national radio network
Caracol, Ms. Herran de Montoya she did not say why police blamed
guerrillas in the Sunday abductions or what the kidnap motive was.
   Pueblo Bello, 310 miles northwest of Bogota, the capital, is in
the Uraba region. Both leftist rebels and right-wing death squads,
apparently run by drug traffickers, have been active there.
   Most of the 31 kidnapped were peasants, national police
headquarters in the state capital of Medellin said.
   While rounding up victims, the abductors burned a rice warehouse
and a tavern, police headquarters in Medellin said in a communique
broadcast by the national radio network Caracol.
   Millions of dollars worth of bananas are shipped from the Uraba
region to the United States each year. The region has been torn by
violence as labor unions try to organize banana plantation workers.
   Right-wing death squads killed two union organizers in the
region last year.
   Such death squads throughout Colombia killed more than 1,000
people in the last four years. A government investigation last year
found that more than 100 death squads exist in Colombia, most run
by drug traffickers.

   Bloomingdale's opened 10 minutes late Monday,
the first sign that the trend-setting store on Manhattan's Upper
East Side was part of a gigantic proceeding in bankruptcy court.
   ``It's the first time in our history we've opened late and the
first time in our history something like this has happened,'' said
Ann Stock, a spokeswoman for the 104-year-old flagship store on
Manhattan's Upper East Side.
   The delay occurred because at 10 a.m., when the store normally
opens, employees were still listening over intercoms to the
announcement that Bloomingdale's parent, Campeau Corp., was filing
for bankruptcy protection.
   Outside, the first shoppers waited in a light rain for the doors
to open, and soon it was business as usual. Shelves were full,
escalators crowded and aggressive sales people enticed buyers
upstairs to buy furs and purses while others lurked at corners to
spray customers with new perfumes.
   Only at the third-floor public relations office and outside the
front door where reporters interviewed customers did anything seem
amiss.
   ``We're trying to keep a lid on it,'' said spokeswoman Katie
Locke.
   Bloomingdale's had already been for sale, and corporate
officials said bids for the chain would still be accepted.
   In the store, though, the only sale signs were those typically
put up after the holidays. There was the ``White Sale,'' the
``Half-year Sale,'' the ``One-half Yearly International Rug Sale''
and hundreds of small signs telling customers to take 20 percent to
40 percent off ticketed prices.
   Customers, in fact, were told they could buy rugs or furniture
worth $300 or more without beginning payments until May.
   ``Obviously this will allow us to go forward with business and
that's what's really in everybody's heart,'' said a harried Ms.
Locke.
   Campeau, owner of several major store chains, asked a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Cincinnati on Monday for Chapter 11 protection
from its creditors in the biggest such filing ever for a retail
business.
   ``Chapter 11 signifies a new beginning and is certainly the best
alternative for us at Bloomingdale's. It provides us with a fresh
start and enables us to go forward,'' Bloomingdale's chairman
Marvin S. Traub and president Jeffrey Sherman said in the
announcement read over store intercoms.
   Traub and Sherman said Campeau's decision ended months of
uncertainty, allowed stores to operate normally, provided a
framework for creditors to be paid and, most importantly, allowed
merchandise shipments to continue ``in a healthy atmosphere.''
   Campeau said its Chapter 11 filing would free retailers to
concentrate on sales rather than their financial problems.
   About 14,000 people work at the Bloomingdale's flagship store,
six other stores in New York and New Jersey, two in Boston, two in
Philadelphia, two in Washington and one each in Miami, Dallas,
Chicago and Boca Raton, Fla.
   Outside the Manhattan store, Lysia O'Keefe of Sydney, Australia,
said she was a little surprised to hear of Bloomingdale's troubles.
   ``Everyone seems to know Bloomingdale's,'' she said. ``Everyone
who comes to New York comes to Bloomingdale's.''

<TEXT>
   The teen-age son of actress Jane Fonda and
her estranged husband, Assemblyman Tom Hayden, was arrested Monday
on charges of painting graffiti in a parking lot, authorities said.
   Troy Hayden, 16, was picked up by his father at the West Los
Angeles police station after the youth was booked for investigation
of vandalism and breaking a 10 p.m. curfew, said Sgt. Rick Walker.
   The younger Hayden and a group of boys were arrested about 1:30
a.m. next to the San Diego Freeway, Walker said.
   ``He and seven other young gentlemen were applying graffiti to
phone booths and posts at a park-and-ride,'' Walker said.
   Detective Ed Purcell said that after an investigation the matter
would be handed over to the probation department, where it would be
decided whether a trial is warranted for the juvenile violations.
   ``They look at all the factors, depends on background and
previous history,'' Purcell said. ``My guess is that it won't go to
trial.''
   Tom Hayden, a Democrat from West Los Angeles, and Miss Fonda
declined to comment.
   The two filed separate divorce petitions in December, and agreed
to share custody of their son. The divorce is not yet final.
   Miss Fonda's daughter, Vanessa Vadim, was arrested last year in
New York for investigation of obstructing governmental
administration, loitering for the purpose of purchasing drugs and
disorderly conduct. Miss Vadim's father is film maker Roger Vadim.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ An American tourist was killed
after throwing himself into the engine of a taxiing jetliner at
Piarco International Airport, police said.
   Airports Authority chairman Winston Suite said the bizarre death
Sunday night was an apparent suicide.
   Police said Daniel John O'Brien, 31, of Roselle, Ill., near
Chicago, scaled an airport wall in the nude, attacked four security
guards and stole their four-wheel-drive vehicle.
   He drove the jeep onto the tarmac to a British Airways 747 that
was readying for takeoff, smashing the vehicle's top. Guards said
O'Brien scrambled out the wreckage, smeared grease on his bleeding
shoulder, then ran back to the jetliner and threw himself into the
engine.
   O'Brien had been vacationing with a friend on Tobago, Trinidad's
sister island in the Caribbean, and was to fly home Monday.
   Other details were not immediately available.

   Dissident Ford Motor Co. workers and the
country's top labor leader met Monday but failed to resolve a
dispute that has left one worker dead and paralyzed Ford's
Cuautitlan plant for a week.
   ``There is no agreement but we continue negotiating,'' Fidel
Velazquez, the 89-year-old secretary general of the Mexican Labor
Federation, said after the meeting.
   Workers are demanding union democracy and the ouster of Hector
Uriarte, secretary-general of the company union at Ford's three
Mexico plants and a parts warehouse.
   Cuautitlan workers, who wanted to get rid of Uriarte when he
came up for re-election last June, say they were barred from the
voting.
   ``We want a representative union,'' said Salvador Fuentes Reyes,
one of the dissident leaders who met with Velazquez.
   About 200 waited outside federation headquarters during the
meeting, carrying banners. One read ``Brother, your union will not
be in vain.''
   Ford, meanwhile, has the government's Federal Mediation Board to
``reanalyze labor relations,'' spokesman Carlos Bandala said.
Velazquez described it as a request to fire the workers.
   He said he does not know how much the loss of production of 450
cars and trucks a day is costing the company.
   The Cuautitlan plant, 15 miles north of Mexico City, is Ford's
largest employer in Mexico with 3,800 workers, and manufactures
about 100,000 cars and trucks a year for the domestic market.
   However, Ford says the Hermosillo plant, which employs 2,400 and
is currently retooling for new models, can make 180,000 vehicles a
year for export.
   On Jan. 8, workers say, thugs who arrived in Mexican Labor
Federation buses, wearing company uniforms and identification
badges, began shooting and beating employees who arrived at 6 a.m.
for the morning shift. One was killed and nine others were injured
by gunfire or blows.
   Carlos Bandala, a spokesman for Ford, said the company had filed
a complaint ``to clarify this situation and fix responsibilities.''
   The company has said it will not issue paychecks or reopen the
plant until there is security for workers. Bandala said there also
must be an agreement between the workers and the federation.

   A SkyWest commuter plane clipped a mountaintop
while trying to land during a snowstorm Monday and plunged down a
steep hillside, injuring all 16 people on board, officials said.
   Most of the passengers, however, walked away from the crash.
Four were admitted to Elko General Hospital and 12 others were
treated and released, according to a nursing supervisor. All four
of those hospitalized were in fair condition, but she refused to
discuss their conditions or give any names.
   She said the worst injury was to the captain, who was admitted
with a broken leg and possible chest injuries.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials said the plane, Flight
5855, was on a hop from Salt Lake City to Elko when it went down at
about 9:30 a.m. west of the airport in this northeastern Nevada
town of 8,800.
   The wreckage was spotted by a helicopter pilot who returned to
Elko to fly medical personnel to the scene and to airlift the most
seriously injured to the hospital.
   Rescuer Pete Schory of Salt Lake City said passengers were
wandering around when he landed at the crash site.
   No one aboard had been thrown from the plane and the fuselage of
the aircraft was intact on the northeast face of the mountain,
Schory said. Metal debris littered the crash scene and the tail
section of the plane had torn free about 50 yards uphill from where
the fuselage came to rest.
   ``Right now, I'm feeling that the outcome is wonderful,'' said
SkyWest President Jerry Atkin. ``The thing you hope for in these
situations is for all survivors. It's certainly unpleasant to have
such a thing happen, but I'm very pleased with the outcome.''
   There was no immediate clue as to the cause of the crash, Atkin
said from St. George, Utah, where the airline is based. He said the
airplane involved was less than a year old.
   The Metro III twin-engine turboprop commuter plane, carrying 14
passengers and two crew members, crashed when the pilot was
attempting an instrument landing during a snowstorm.
   Ted McBride, the rescue helicopter pilot, said the plane
apparently just clipped the top of a 6,463-foot summit about four
miles from the airport, 1,328 feet below. He said if the plane had
been just a few feet higher, it would have cleared the mountain.
   The plane then became airborne briefly before skidding about a
quarter of a mile down the steep slope.
   Nicole Blohm of Elko, a passenger aboard the plane, said it was
snowing heavily and she saw just a few glimpses of ground below her
before the crash.
   Monday was the third anniversary of another SkyWest crash. A
SkyWest commuter plane on final approach to the Salt Lake City
airport collided with a smaller aircraft on Jan. 15, 1987, killing
all 10 people in both planes and showering debris on a residential
area.
   SkyWest serves 44 cities in eight Western states: Nevada,
Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Colorado, Utah, Arizona and California,
Atkin said. It has 500 flights a day and serves more than a million
passengers a year.
   The Metro III commuter plane is made by Fairchild Aircraft Corp.
in San Antonio, Texas, and seats up to 19 passengers. The model has
been in service since June 1980.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega accused
Nicaragua's opposition Monday of plotting to set the stage for a
U.S. invasion ``like Panama'' by quitting the race and making the
Feb. 25 elections look fraudulent.
   The National Opposition Union, or UNO, denied the charge and
U.N. election observer Elliot Richardson said he was assured the
coalition was in the race to stay.
   In a voice hoarse from campaign appearances, Ortega said of UNO,
``They're not playing fair, because they're working so as to create
in Nicaragua a situation similar to that of Panama ... and drag the
United States into it.''
   Ortega said he told Richardson, a former U.S. attorney general
who was in Nicaragua to represent U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, that he feared such a ploy could set the
groundwork for U.S. troop intervention, comparing it to what
happened last month in Panama.
   Richardson acknowledged Ortega's concerns but said UNO officials
assured him the coalition was not pulling out.
   He also said ``significant improvement'' had been made in the
election process, but more had to be done to insure a free and fair
election.
   Richardson told a news conference after a three-hour meeting
with Ortega that campaign violence has declined and the opposition
had more access to government-controlled media. But he said the
U.N. mission will continue to monitor complaints about rural
opposition candidates being intimidated.
   He also expressed concern about reports of attacks by the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels in the countryside.
   Opposition spokesman Danilo Lacayo denied UNO was withdrawing
from the race. He called Ortega's denunciation another tactic by
the leftist Sandinista government to create the impression the
opposition is weak, ``taking advantage of the fact that the
candidates are out of the country.''
   The campaign of the 14-party opposition coalition has been
stalled by personality clashes, defections and complaints over lack
of money.
   UNO broke with its campaign routine and did not hold any weekend
allies for next month's national elections, in which Ortega is
seeking re-election against UNO candidate Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, publisher of La Prensa, Nicaragua's only opposition
newspaper.
   ``The main concern that I expressed has to do with the attitude
of the U.S. government, with the Contra activity and also the risk
being run should UNO withdraw from the electoral process,'' Ortega
told reporters after meeting Richardson.
   ``The UNO people have expectations to create a situation like
Panama.''
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega annulled Panama's May 7 elections
when returns showed President Guillermo Endara, then the opposition
candidate, was winning by a landslide. That was one of the
incidents that eventually led the United States to invade Panama
Dec. 20 and oust Noriega, now jailed in Miami awaiting trial on
drug-trafficking charges.
   Since then, the Sandinistas repeatedly said the United States
plans to invade Nicaragua next. Bush administration officials just
as insistently denied this.
   Mrs. Chamorro fractured a knee in a fall at her home on New
Year's Eve and has not campaigned since.
   She went to Houston for medical treatment, then to New York and
Washington on Monday, where she was joined by her son-in-law and
campaign manager Antonio Lacayo. She was expected back in Nicaragua
Tuesday.
   UNO vice presidential candidate Virgilio Godoy was out on a
five-day trip to California and returned to Nicaragua Friday.
   Opposition sources said privately there has been been bickering
between Godoy and Antonio Lacayo; among Godoy and UNO's political
council of representatives from the 14 parties; between the council
and Alfredo Cesar, an adviser to Mrs. Chamorro; and between Cesar
and Godoy.
   Last week, UNO accused the government of blocking about $2
million in campaign aid the U.S. Congress approved in October, but
over the weekend La Prensa reported a government minister agreed to
release the money.
   Last week, a dozen minor UNO candidates pulled out of the race,
citing reasons that ranged from feeling neglected by national
leadership to complaints they had not been paid campaign expenses.
   The Sandinistas came to power in July 1979, after overthrowing
Anastasio Somoza, a right-wing dictator backed by the United States.
   The United States later began supporting the Contras fighting
the government.
   Ortega advanced the election date from November and promised a
free vote after he and four other Central American presidents
signed a regional peace accord Aug. 7, pledging to disband the
Contras, based in southern Honduras.

<TEXT>
   Up to 5,000 people demonstrated for reform in the
third street rally in the wintry Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator
the past month, a foreign source said Tuesday.
   The source said the demonstrators, led by the newly formed
Mongolian Democratic Union (MDU), attacked former ruler Yumjaagiyn
Tsedenbal and criticized the Mongolia's Communist Party Politburo,
or the Mongolia People's Revolutionary Party.
   The demonstrators were peaceful and ``good-humored'' and police
made no attempt to interfere, the source said. The temperature was
about 4 degrees below zero during the gathering Sunday on the steps
of a movie theater in central Ulan Bator.
   The MDU, a group thought to be made up of reform-minded
intellectuals and artists, also led open-air rallies on two Sundays
in December. The December demonstrations drew far fewer people,
with crowds estimated at several hundred to 1,000.
   The group reportedly has adopted a draft charter and petitioned
the nation's parliament for official status.
   The source said demonstrators at the most recent protest carried
banners calling for Tsedenbal to be put on trial and urging a
faster pace of perestroika, or reforms like those championed by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Tsedenbal, purged in 1984 after more than three decades in
power, has been criticized by the current government for his forced
collectivization policies and his ``bureaucratic centralism.''
   Mongolia, a nation of 2 million people spread across the vast
deserts and grasslands of eastern Asia, has cautiously followed the
reform policies taken by its protector state, the Soviet Union.
   The government has acknowledged the pace of reform has been too
slow, and members of parliament have called for fundamental changes
in price and wage systems in the state-controlled economy.
   The source said it was not clear whether political upheaval in
East Europe was influencing events in distant Mongolia and it was
probably ``wrong to rush toward expectations'' of dramatic changes
in the country.
   Other sources agreed that while the momentum for reform was
picking up, advocates of change appeared willing to work within the
system and not directly confront the ruling party.
   There was no word on the protest by the government.

   An man killed his girlfriend, their baby
daughter and the girlfriend's sister before taking his own life
Monday, police said.
   Donald Lee Whigham, 28, of Smyrna ``left home with the intent of
taking the lives of the mother and their child, and then his own,''
said Stanley Hook, police chief of this northwest Atlanta suburb.
   ``There was an argument between the baby's mother and the
subject,'' Hook said. ``The other sister went back in there to
remove the baby, and she couldn't get out.''
   Whigham's girlfriend was identified as Tara Gossett, 18; their
child was Destiny Amber Gossett, 4 months old, Hook said. Also
killed was Ms. Gossett's sister, Tracy Gossett, 20.
   Smyrna police answered a trouble call about 11:30 a.m. at an
apartment complex where Tara Gossett and her baby lived with Tracy
Gossett, her boyfriend, their child and another man, Hook said.
   Police found the Gossett sisters and Tara's daughter shot to
death in one bedroom. Whigham was in the front seat of his car
outside, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Hook said.
   Tracy Gossett's baby, her boyfriend and the other man who shared
the apartment also were home at the time of the shootings, Hook
said. One of the other men was shot at by the gunman but was not
hurt, he said.

   Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave flew to
Bucharest on Monday for talks with the new Romanian leadership, the
Foreign Office said.
   Waldegrave, the Foreign Office minister in charge of Eastern
Europe, will meet the ``new emerging leaders of Romania,'' the
spokesman said, and later Tuesday is to fly to Bonn for two days of
talks with West German officials.
   Waldegrave made no comment before leaving London's Heathrow
Airport aboard a regularly scheduled Swissair flight, but another
Foreign Office minister called for a cautious approach to the
changes convulsing Eastern Europe.
   ``In our delight at the proclamation of liberal democratic
values ... across Eastern Europe, we should remain alert to the
risk that in one country or another, there could still be a lurch
backwards,'' Foreign Office Minister Francis Maude told the
Anglo-German Association in London.
   ``Our enthusiasm for change must therefore still be tempered by
caution,'' he said.
   Minister for Overseas Development Lynda Chalker, meanwhile,
reassured developing countries that Britain's assistance for
Eastern Europe will not be at their expense.
   ``We have a special responsibility to assist the progress of
economic reform,'' Mrs. Chalker told the Royal College of Defense
Studies. ``Its importance for African, Asian, Pacific and Caribbean
countries is in no way lessened by the new program of economic
reform in Eastern Europe.''

   Senior military officers from 35 nations
on Tuesday will open the first East-West talks in history on the
defense policies that guide the superpowers and their allies.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
was an early arrival in Vienna. The Soviets' head military man,
Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, also is due to attend.
   U.S. officials said Powell will try to meet with the top brass
from every country present.
   The meeting, officially known as the military doctrine seminar,
will last three weeks. It was set months ago as part of East-West
efforts to reduce military tensions, and took on growing importance
with the political upheavals in Eastern Europe.
   John Maresca, head of the U.S. delegation to the talks on
Confidence-Building and Security-Building Measures, said Monday
that Western experts want ``to understand better what these Eastern
European countries are thinking at this time (and) how their
policies are going to evolve.''
   Nations ranging from the two superpowers to tiny Liechtenstein
and the Holy See will be part of the discussions.
   The first week's agenda will concentrate on an overview of
security policies.
   The 16 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
seven of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact are holding separate talks in
Vienna on reducing conventional, or non-nuclear, forces in Europe.
   Officials also will have a chance to question each other about
the military policies that cover conventional forces in Europe. The
idea is to lessen the secrecy that surrounds these policies.
   Maresca said the discussions were an experiment. No report or
conclusions would be drawn at the end.

Monday in a landslide vote by the legislature.
   The election of Algirdas Brazauskas by a vote of 228-4, with 19
abstentions, was a clear endorsement by the republic's Supreme
Soviet legislature of his stand challenging Moscow and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev visited Lithuania from Thursday to Saturday to try to
persuade Lithuanian Communists to reverse their Dec. 20 decision to
break from the national Communist Party. The Lithuanians would not
budge and Gorbachev failed to end the schism. He concluded his
visit Saturday with the mild statement, ``We have laid a good
foundation for continuing the dialogue.''
   The official news agency Tass reported Monday's balloting.
   Sources in the republic's media said the Supreme Soviet also
voted to restrict voting rights for soldiers and sailors to those
who have lived in Lithuania for at least 10 years, in effect
limiting it to native Lithuania residents and a few long-serving
officers.
   Brazauskas, 57, replaced Vytautas Astrauskas, who resigned.
Astrauskas, 59, had served as Lithuania's president since December
1987. Lithuanian activists saw him as a conservative, but not a
vehement foe of the independence drive.
   In keeping with Gorbachev's drive for democratic reforms,
Brazauskas faced alternative candidates: national legislator
Kazimeras Motieka and Romualdas Ozolas, a leader of the
pro-independence group Sajudis.
   Brazauskas has been the republican Communist Party's first
secretary since Oct. 20, 1988. His new title, the equivalent of
president, is chairman of the Presidium of the Lithuanian Supreme
Soviet.
   Lithuanian TV journalist Eduardas Potasinskas, a close observer
of Lithuanian politics, said Monday's vote will ``strengthen the
position of Brazauskas in dealing with Moscow.''
   Gorbachev pleaded for unity repeatedly while in Lithuanian, but
was confronted by pro-independence demonstrators at many stops.
Public opinion strongly supports independence for the republic,
which was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 while
occupied by the Red Army.
   Potasinskas said that the Supreme Soviet in later action voted
to impose the 10-year residency requirement as of Feb. 24 for
military personnel to vote in local elections.
   That practically limits voting rights to natives of Lithuania
who are serving in their home republic or to a handful of officers
who have served in the same post for many years.
   The national government has struck down similar attempts to
restrict voting rights in other republics.
   No discussion took place at the Supreme Soviet of how many
people it would effect, and the Soviet Union does not publicize the
number of military personnel stationed in its republics.

<HEAD>Indonesia Sees Chance for Meeting on Cambodia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said
Monday a good chance exists for a meeting on Cambodia because none
of the warring parties objected to an Australian proposal to set up
an interim U.N. authority.
   Alatas, a main organizer of Cambodian peace talks, spoke to
reporters upon returning Monday from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
   Earlier, at a meeting in Chiang Mai, Thailand, he sought out the
willingness of the four parties directly involved in the Cambodian
conflict to return to negotiations. He also discussed the issue
with Vietnamese and Thai officials.
   He reported, ``No one has objected to the idea of using the
basic proposition contained in the Australian proposal. ... All
parties agree to lay down the proposal as a basis for a new
informal meeting.''
   The Indonesian minister said Australia's basic proposal will not
resolve the conflict _ ``It is clear that further negotiations are
needed on the form of the U.N. interim government.''
   Alatas said he therefore will report to President Suharto and
then consult with France, which with Indonesia presided over an
international conference on Cambodia held last August. He also said
he will discuss with members of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations.
   ASEAN groups Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, the
Philippnes and Brunei.
   ``I have the feeling that perhaps the time has now come for us
to meet again. ... There are reasonable chances (for meeting), but
we should be prepared well. The third or fourth week of February
would most probably be proposed,'' he said.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978, toppling the communist
Khmer Rouge government that killed hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians during its 3{ years in power as it sought to enforce a
primitive agrarian communism.
   Last September, Vietnam said it had withdrawn the last of its
troops from Cambodia, leaving the government it installed there to
fight a three-party resistance coalition, which includes the Khmer
Rouge.

   Church bells across the country tolled the loss of Martin Luther
King Jr. on his birthday Monday, a ringing reminder of the racial
conflicts the slain civil rights leader struggled to overcome but
which still haunt the nation.
   ``With each ring we are called to an accountability, an
accountability of the soul and of the heart's conscience that asks,
`What have you done to let freedom ring?''' asked Pennsylvania Gov.
Robert P. Casey during a ceremony at the Liberty Bell.
   A moment of silence was called to reflect on King's lessons of
non-violence in his pursuit of racial equality. The
Washington-based Federal Holiday Commission said bells chimed at
12:30 p.m. EST in all 50 states and 144 countries. The New York
Stock Exchange paused for a moment at noon.
   ``Today, the sound of liberty is being heard all around the
world,'' said James Farmer, founder of the Congress for Racial
Equality, who pounded the Liberty Bell three times with his fist.
``Those who have been denied liberty love it most. Dr. King loved
liberty and he fought and died for it.''
   Most of the celebrations were peaceful, but the memory of King's
espousal of nonviolent resistance didn't prevent fights from
breaking out in New Orleans following a parade in his honor
attended by tens of thousands of people.
   Two whites were arrested after a fight in which a black man was
hit with nail-studded boards. A teen-ager was fatally stabbed and a
young black man was critically wounded by a stray bullet in
separate fights between groups of black teens, officials said.
   In San Diego, racist graffitti was sprayed on signs on a freeway
named for him,and demonstrations protesting non-observance of the
holiday took place in Arizona, New Hampshire and elsewhere.
   The observances followed church services, parades, and other
celebrations held during the weekend before the federal holiday,
which for the first time falls on King's actual birthday. He would
have been 61.
   Much of Monday's focus was on Atlanta, where King grew up as the
son of a Baptist minister.
   ``Now is the time to organize a global non-violent movement
based on Dr. King's teachings, to put an end to the scourges of
poverty, hunger, racism and bigotry, war and militarism,'' said his
widow, Coretta Scott King, at an annual ecumenical service at
Ebenezer Baptist Church, where her husband delivered some of his
most stirring orations.
   A ``March of Celebration'' also was held, despite bitter
objections from one of King's top lieutenants in the civil rights
movement who charged the parade trivialized the day and wasted
money that could serve the poor.
   ``This has been prostituted more than any other holiday except
Jesus Christ's birthday,'' the Rev. Hosea Williams said at a news
conference in front of an Atlanta housing project.
   About 25,000 people lined Los Angeles' streets for the fifth
annual King Birthday Celebration Parade down a boulevard named for
him, and 2,500 turned out for an annual breakfast in Boston.
   During his lifetime, King led non-violent marches and protests
in the South in the 1950s and 1960s in a quest to end
discrimination against blacks and other minorities.
   His first blow against racism came when he led a year long
bocott of segregated buses in Montgomery, Ala. From there he
established the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to set the
pace of working peacefully for equal rights for blacks. In 1964, he
received the Nobel Peace Prize.
   He was shot and killed on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.
   But racial inequities and clashes still tear at America's
consciousness today.
   In the Southeast, there have been a series of bombings and
threats, apparently racially motivated, and in Boston race
relations were strained after an apparent hoax in which a white man
claimed a black mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife and wounded
him.
   Boston residents on Monday spoke of the racial implications of
Charles Stuart's grisly fraud.
   ``The Stuart case has shown how fragile race relations are in
this country,'' said state Rep. Byron Rushing. ``And it's become a
kind of metaphor for healing.''
   The day, however, came at a moment of gains for blacks, the
first day on the job for the nation's first elected black governor
in Virginia and the start of a new administion for New York City's
first black mayor.
   L. Douglas Wilder's victory in Virginia inspires, some said.
   ``Is it not poetic justice that the first day of Doug Wilder's
stay in office takes place on the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.?'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson asked at a prayer breakfast in
Washington, D.C.
   In New York, about 120 people who walked across the Brooklyn
Bridge to City Hall in the 10th annual march were greeted by Mayor
David Dinkins.
   In addition to the gala celebrations, King's birthday was marked
with protests.
   Several took place in Concord, N.H. About 150 Merrimack Valley
High School students walked out of morning classes to recognize
Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which their school did not observe.
   A school custodian hoisted the American flag half-staff as the
students recited the Pledge of Allegiance during the half-hour
ceremony.
   New Hampshire is one of four states without any form of King
holiday. The others are Arizona, Montana and Idaho. Some other
states keep workers on the job, but mark the day in other ways.
   Several hundred students and faculty members at St. Paul's
School, which announced Monday morning that it would observe the
holiday, marched from the private school's Concord campus to the
Statehouse.
   More than 200 students in Milford, N.H., staged a sit-in at the
high school library, and 125 in Wolfeboro staged a lunchtime
demonstration that kept them out of classes for two hours.
   In another Concord demonstration, about 150 members of the
anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance marched from the Federal Building
to the Statehouse plaza to protest the Seabrook nuclear plant.
   They sang songs against the plant and such civil rights hymns as
``We Shall Overcome.'' Thirty-seven people who stayed inside the
Statehouse after closing time were arrested on criminal trespass
charges.
   In Arizona, where the King holiday has long been a bitter
controversy, a Phoenix crowd estimated by police at nearly 15,000
heard lawmakers and community leaders at the capitol urge them to
register and vote in a referendum this fall over whether to let a
King Day observance become law. Another 2,000 people marched in
Tucson.
   A bill to make the day a holiday was introduced in the Idaho
Senate, but an effort to win immediate consideration for a similar
bill was defeated in the South Dakota House.
   In Columbia, Mo., about 200 students sat down inside the
University of Missouri's administration building to protest the
school's decision not to cancel classes for the day.
   About 100 people in Monroe, La., demonstrated outside the
Ouachita Parish School Board to protest its refusal to observe the
holiday.
   In San Diego, two signs on 10-mile stretch of highway named for
King were painted overnight with swastikas and the letters ``SWP,''
thought to stand for ``Supreme White Power,'' said police Lt. John
Gregory.

<HEAD>Rape Victim Picks Out Suspect Using Senses of Smell and Touch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blind woman used her sense of touch and smell
to identify a 14-year-old neighbor as the person who raped her,
police said, but it was unclear Monday how the identification would
be received in court.
   Police were amazed at the woman's ability to identify a suspect
in the assault, which occurred late Saturday.
   The 24-year-old woman, legally blind for three years, recognized
the scent of the suspect's cologne when she accompanied police on a
search of her building, investigators said.
   She recognized his hands during a lineup, police said.
   ``It was the smell of the cologne,'' the woman said Sunday.
``That was the major key. I could tell, too, by the size of his
hands and how rough or smooth they were.''
   She said the assailant held his hands over her mouth during the
attack.
   The suspect, who lives in the victim's apartment building on the
same floor, was named in a juvenile petition and ordered held in a
youth home. He was scheduled to appear Tuesday in Juvenile Court
for a status hearing.
   Police said authorities will seek a court order for testing to
determine if bodily fluids left at the scene of the attack might be
the youth's.
   But a detective questioned whether the victim's identification
of her attacker would hold up in court.
   ``We have no voice, no witnesses,'' said Detective Karl Kurth.
``It's very little. The sense of smell and feel. Is that enough to
stand in a court of law? I don't know.''
   A Northwestern University law professor, Jim Hadadd, said Monday
the case appeared to be unique.
   ``There have been cases involving voice identifications, but
I've never heard of identifying somebody by his scent or the feel
of his hands,'' Hadadd said.
   The woman said she was in the apartment building's laundry room
when the assailant shoved her in a corner and raped her. Afterward,
he handed her a used condom, she said.
   The woman said it was the third time she'd been the target of
sexual assault.

<HEAD>Iraqi Minister Says Turkey's Have Given Assurances on Euphrates</HEAD>

   Turkey has reaffirmed its promise to
downstream neighbors to share the waters of the Euphrates River,
cut off for one month to fill a reservoir and allow construction
work, Iraq's oil minister said Monday.
   The minister, Issam Abdul Rahim Al-Chalabi, also said Turkey's
project to harness the waters will benefit neighboring countries in
the arid region.
   Al-Chalabi arrived Sunday, a day after Turkey diverted much of
the Euphrates to fill the reservoir of its giant Ataturk dam. He
delivered a message from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to Turkish
President Turgut Ozal.
   Al-Chalabi said he had ``a very positive, an excellent talk''
with Ozal. But neither side would comment on Turkey's answer to an
Iraqi request that the river diversion be reduced from a month to
two weeks.
   Turks say they need at least one month to fill the reservoir of
the $4 billion project, the centerpiece of the massive Southeast
Anatolia project of 15 dams and 18 hydroelectric plants to be
erected on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.
   The one-month diversion will cut off 75 percent of the water
Syria and Iraq get from the river, which has been the lifeblood of
the region that was once known as Mesopotamia.
   The 1,460-mile-long river originates in the mountains of eastern
Turkey, runs through Syria and then Iraq before joining the Tigris
and emptying into the Persian Gulf.
   The blockage will seriously harm Iraq and could cause ``a real
agricultural disaster'' in the long term, Iraq's ruling Baath
Socialist Party's newspaper, Al-Thawra, warned in a front-page
editorial Sunday.
   The paper said an agreement between Turkey, Syria and Iraq is
needed for the sharing of the Euphrates waters ``in a flexible
way.''
   Syria formally protested to Turkey late Monday, saying the
cutoff violated international law, informed sources reported. The
sources, who requested anonymity, said the foreign ministry
summoned Turkish Ambassador Erhan Tuncel in Damascus and told him
Ankara's step was ``an unjustified precedent.''
   For a month before the reduction of waters, Turkey released
twice the usual amount downstream so southern neighbors could store
it in their reservoirs, Turkish officials said.

   A professor who says he knows who wrote an
article speculating on the future of change in the Soviet Union
stood by his assertion Monday, though the man he identified as the
mysterious ``Z'' denied the claim. William E. Jackson Jr., an
international affairs professor at the University of Arkansas at
Fayetteville, said last week _ and reiterated Monday _ that ``Z''
was his longtime friend William Odom, a retired lieutenant general
who once directed the National Security Agency.
   Jackson was formerly a staffer for ex-Sen. J. William Fulbright,
D-Ark., one-time chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``Z'' is the pseudonym attached to an article in the scholarly
journal Daedalus and excerpted recently in The New York Times. The
article takes a dim view of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
chances of making the Soviet system economically efficient and
politically democratic while maintaining the primacy of the
Communist Party.
   Odom, reached Monday by telephone at his office in the political
science department at Yale University, said of speculation that he
is ``Z'': ``I deny it. I don't know how this thing has gotten off
the ground. It's just wild.''
   He declined further comment. Last week, he also denied the claim
but told a reporter for the Arkansas Democrat that the reporter
would be correct in quoting Jackson.
   ``You can write what he says,'' Odom said.
   What Jackson said, last week and again Monday, was that Odom was
``Z.''
   ``For good reason, I think, I am not stepping back from the
conclusion of my original speculation,'' Jackson said in a prepared
statement Monday. ``Odom is `Z.'''
   Jackson said he had known Odom for 30 years, ``ever since we
were graduate students in the Russian Institute at Columbia
University. I have read everything he has ever publicly written _
sometimes in draft form _ and I know his writing style.''
   Jackson acknowledged that Odom has not admitted to him he is
`Z,' but said he talked with him by telephone for about 1{ hours
Sunday night.
   According to Jackson, Odom said ``he was in a predicament
because he, in fact, denied being `Z''' but had told the Democrat's
reporter that the ``Z'' article was ``like some things he had
written'' and also that ``you and Jackson can make any speculation
you want to make.''
   ``He told me that he thought my `deductive reasoning' proved
what a brilliant analyst I was,'' Jackson said.

   A man who said he was a personal banker to
deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega faces a federal trial on
money laundering charges Tuesday along with a Luxembourg
bank-holding company and five other bank officers.
   Two men from Medellin, Colombia _ home of the powerful cocaine
cartel named for that city _ are also defendants in the U.S.
District Court trial in Tampa.
   During a two-year sting operation, undercover U.S. Customs
agents penetrated powerful Colombian syndicates and helped launder
an estimated $32 million from U.S. cocaine sales, federal
authorities said.
   The Bank of Credit and Commerce International, or BCCI, and nine
of its officers were indicted on money-laundering charges in Tampa
in October 1988.
   In all, indictments were returned in eight cities charging more
than 80 people in a drug-related money-laundering scheme.
   Customs agents said the money was intended mainly for Colombian
drug traffickers, including the Medellin Cartel.
   BCCI, based in London and chartered in Luxembourg, has
operations in 73 countries. The company has $14 million in escrow
and millions more that might be subject to forfeiture should the
government win a conviction.
   The U.S. goverment also filed civil complaints seeking
forfeiture of property and funds and BCCI assets. BCCI was allowed
to continue operations after setting up the escrow account to cover
the amount the government contended the bank had laundered.
   Defendant Amjad Awan, 41, of Coral Gables, who worked as Latin
American division director of BCCI, told Senate investigators he
personally managed a secret account Noriega opened at the bank's
Panamanian branch in 1982. Awan said Noriega was the only one who
could authorize withdrawals and that a balance of up to $25 million
was kept in the account.
   Awan told Senate investigators that Noriega closed his BCCI
acocunt when the indictments were announced. Awan denied knowledge
of any drug dealing by Noriega or the bank.
   According to the indictment, undercover agents first contacted
BCCI representatives in February 1987, then began opening bank
accounts at different branches. BCCI officials were to receive drug
money and put it in certificates of deposit in one of the branches,
agents said.
   The branches used included locations in France, Panama, Uruguay,
the Bahamas, Luxembourg and England.
   Bank officials would then create a loan at another branch,
permit the drug traffickers to withdraw the funds, then repay the
loan with money in the certificates of deposit, investigators said.
   The other BCCI officers to be tried with Awan are Syed Aftab
Hussain, operations officer in the Panama branch; Akbar A. Bilgrami
of Miami, director of the Latin American division; Sibte Hassan, an
officer in the Paris branch; Ian Howard, a French manager of BCCI
and Iqbal Ashraf of Lawndale, Calif., manager of the Los Angeles
branch.
   Also to be tried are Gonzalo Mora Jr., who's accused of handling
money for the cocaine cartel and Rudolph Armbrecht of Medellin, who
prosecutors say is his partner. Both men are from Medellin.
   All eight face various charges relating to conspiracy to launder
drug proceeds.
   The three other BCCI officers indicted in 1988 are foreigners
who have been arrested but have not extradited to the United States.
   In another Tampa indictment related to the case, Los Angeles
jeweler Roberto Baez-Alcaino pleaded guilty in July 1989 and struck
a deal with prosecutors which remains secret. He was charged with
managing a cocaine ring which generated the bulk of the $32 million.
   Indictments in the case were also returned in Chicago, Detroit,
Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia.

   A fire broke out in an engine of an
Aspen Airways plane shortly after takeoff Monday, but the plane
returned to the airport and made an emergency landing without
further incident, officials said.
   None of the 26 passengers aboard the Convair 580 propjet was
injured, officials said.
   Details of the incident were sketchy, and Aspen Airways
spokesmen at company headquarters in Denver could not be reached by
telephone for comment.
   The plane took off from Walker Field here at 4:50 p.m., bound
for Denver, but the engine apparently caught fire about five
minutes into the flight, according to authorities.
   Officials said the pilot cut the engine, and the aircraft landed
under power from the remaining engine about 5:10 p.m. The fire was
out when the plane landed, witnesses said.

   Azerbaijanis and Armenians appeared on the verge
of open warfare today after a spasm of ethnic clashes and pogroms
in the southern republic of Azerbaijan claimed at least 32 lives,
Soviet media reported.
   The Kremlin flew reinforcements of internal security troops to
Azerbaijan to try to stop the bloodletting, the worst between the
two ethnic groups since their long-simmering feud in the Caucasus
boiled over nearly two years ago.
   High-level troobleshooters were dispatched to the Azerbaijani
capital of Baku, where the killing began Saturday night, and to
Yerevan, capital of the neighboring republic of Armenia, Soviet
radio reported today.
   ``Armenia is in a state of battle readiness,'' Karen

   On the eve of a crucial Parliament
meeting, more than 50,000 people rallied in Sofia to demand a
swifter transition to democracy and the immediate dismissal of old
guard Communists still in the leadership.
   The demonstrators, who chanted ``Communists resign! Resign!''
sought to keep up the pressure on legislators, who were expected to
abolish the Communist Party's 44-year monopoly on power at a
meeting today.
   Also on the legislator's agenda was a resolution aimed at
defusing ethnic tensions between Slavic nationalists and members of
Bulgaria's estimated 1.2 million ethnic Turks.
   Demonstrators on Sunday called for a ``government of national
accord'' and the resignation of Premier Georgi Atanassov, a
holdover from the hard-line Communist rule of Todor Zhivkov, ousted
Nov. 10 after 34 years in power.

   While optimistic entrepreneurs see potential pots of gold at the

   But many say they need to enter the markets at the ground floor,
cultivating contacts and learning language and cultural skills

   While federal prosecutors were moving to
indict Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega on narcotics charges, the
Drug Enforcement Administration was maintaining close ties with him
and offering praise for his cooperation in the war against drugs, a
congressional report shows.
   ``The DEA has long welcomed our close association and we stand
ready to proceed jointly against international drug traffickers
whenever the opportunity arises,'' drug enforcement administrator
Jack Lawn wrote to Noriega less than a year before the indictment
was entered in federal court in Miami in February 1988.
   Lawn had special praise for the work of Luis Quiel, Noriega's
liaison to the DEA, as ``integral to the success of fighting
international drug trafficking.''
   But according to the final report of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on narcotics, issued in December 1988, Quiel
was also Noriega's liaison to the Medellin drug cartel and ``thus
in a position to alert the drug traffickers to whatever information
the DEA had provided him.''

   The paroled child killer accused of
murdering 11 women during the past two years was not even a suspect
until the morning police spotted him sitting in a car near the
frozen body of one of the victims.
   Arthur J. Shawcross fell into the hands of police the ay most
serial killers are caught: after months of grueling investigation _
and a dose of good luck.
   Serial killers often fall prey to their mistakes, said Jack
Levin, a sociology professor at Northeastern University who has
written a book on multiple slayers.
   ``Not because of a multimillion-dollar task force, not because
of the skillful investigative techniques of the police ... but
because of a mistake he made. That is typical.''

   Robert T. Morris has been described as a
genius, yet the jury judging his computer hacking trial is
comprised of software illiterates _ and deliberately so.
   Morris, 25, a suspended Cornell University graduate student, is
charged with computer tampering for allegedly unleashing a wildly
replicating ``worm'' program that temporarily immobilized a U.S.
computer network in November 1988.
   Lawyers say it's not uncommon to fill a jury with people
unfamiliar with a subject that is central to a trial, but it can be
a gamble.
   ``By choosing jurors that are not particularly sophisticated
about technology you create a juror pool with an open mind, or at
least you hope so,'' said Theodore Hagelin, a computer law
professor and director of the Law Technology and Management program
at Syracuse University.

<HEAD>Spy Sagas, TV-Style, From Frederick Forsyth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frederick Forsyth may be best known for his
espionage sagas on the page, but a good plot, he says, should make
good TV, as well.
   ``The story comes first, and it would in either medium,'' said
the best-selling novelist of ``The Odessa File'' and ``The Day of
the Jackal,'' whose six-part series, ``Frederick Forsyth
Presents,'' continues Jan. 17 on cable television's USA Network.
   The upcoming episode, ``Pride and Extreme Prejudice,'' is the
second of six two-hour thrillers plotted by Forsyth and written by
Murray Smith. Forsyth explained the division of labor: ``Dialogue
is what Murray does best; what I do best is devise the stories.''
   Brian Dennehy plays Bruno Morenz, a Western operative based in
Bonn, West Germany, who has a nervous breakdown while on a mission
to the East. Alan Howard plays the British agent who tries to save
Morenz from the KGB. The supporting cast includes Lisa Eichhorn and
Simon Cadell.
   Forsyth said the episode's emphasis on psychology was unusual
for him.
   ``It's a more human storyline. The guy's gone back to childhood;
he's just a blubbering wreck,'' Forsyth, 51, said in an interview.
``He's been pushed too far; one feels sorry for him.''
   Forsyth said he was intrigued by the prospect of such an event
happening behind the Iron Curtain.
   ``Normally, he'd have a breakdown at home or in the office, but
to have it in the middle of East Germany ...,'' he said, his voice
trailing off. Forsyth is co-producer, as well, of ``Frederick
Forsyth Presents,'' which began Dec. 13 and continues through June.
   Each of the thrillers is meant to stand on its own. Only Alan
Howard's character, Sam McCready, figures in each one.
   Later episodes involve such familiar Forsyth terrain as
defectors, terrorism and even a character, Carlos ``the jackal,''
modeled on the assassin who hijacked the OPEC oil ministry meeting
in Vienna in 1975.
   A former foreign correspondent, Forsyth said he drew his plots
from current headlines: ``Everything I write is triggered by
something.''
   ``Often I read something in a newspaper and that triggers some
other idea _ What if? What would happen if? Would it be possible
to?''
   He expressed no worries about keeping up with current events in
a political climate where ideologies and allegiances seem to change
daily.
   Consider, for example, East Berlin, where the communist
authorities have relinquished their grip, and people from the East
cross freely through the Berlin Wall into the West. None of this,
he says invalidates the fact that East Berlin has been ``a very
nasty place.''
   He added that ``Pride and Extreme Prejudice'' could be regarded
as a period piece.
   ``The episode happened before, when the Berlin Wall really was
impregnable and East Germany really was a police state, and I think
people accept that,'' he said. ``I don't think everyone believes
what's on screen had to happen in the last 24 hours.''
   Forsyth said he regarded politics as ``a spectator sport.'' But
he remained skeptical about the so-called ``Gorbachev revolution''
that has seen a softening of hard-line ideology as East and West
effect a rapport.
   ``I think (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev has a very slim
chance of delivering the economy he's talking about,'' said
Forsyth. ``The problems he's inherited with the crazy communist
economic system are insuperable.
   ``It's like trying to turn a T-model Ford into a Grand Prix
racecar by fine tuning the engine. The Model Ford still goes at a
top speed of whatever; it will always.''
   Forsyth's most recent full-length novel, ``The Negotiator,'' is
a hostage drama set in 1991, and it should arrive on small screens
around the same time.
   ``The spy thriller doesn't make a blockbuster,'' Forsyth said.
Of the feature films made from his books, only Fred Zinnemann's
1973 ``The Day of the Jackal,'' about an attempted assassination of
French leader Charles de Gaulle, was a hit.
   ``There's something they lose in translation,'' he said.
``Obviously one would like to have had a `Fatal Attraction' or a
`Jagged Edge.'''
   ``The Negotiator'' will be filmed for Home Box Office in the
United States, possibly in partnership with Granada Television in
Britain, he said.
   Before that project starts shooting, Forsyth plans to rest,
tending to the Hertfordshire farm west of London which he bought 18
months ago.

<HEAD>Demand for Housing and Offices Surges in Space-Short West Berlin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Real estate agents have been besieged with
requests for housing and office space over the past few weeks as
businesses worldwide try to get a foot in the door of an
increasingly less divided Berlin.
   But this crowded enclave of capitalism has hung out a ``no
vacancy'' sign until opportunities open up in the relatively empty
East Berlin.
   ``There is definitely a boom in demand that began late last
year,'' said Willi Bendzko, head of the German Rental Agents
Association here and owner of a real estate firm. ``But we have
practically no bureau space to offer.''
   Wolfgang Heinze of the West Berlin Economics Ministry says his
office cannot estimate the number of businessmen scouring the city
for office and living space, ``but it is absolutely clear that
numerous West European and overseas firms want to relocate or open
new branches here.''
   The sudden interest for expansion into both sectors of Berlin is
clearly connected with the rise in expectations of an eventual
reunification of the two Germanys and the commanding economic power
the new state would wield.
   Planners and politicians on both sides of the city expect a
greater Berlin with as many as 6 million residents to be
functioning as a single municipality within the next two to three
years.
   West Berlin's current population is about 2.1 million; East
Berlin has 1.9 million residents.
   Conservatives in support of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's push for a
formally reunited Germany believe that the provisional West German
capital set up in Bonn 40 years ago could be relocated to Berlin as
well. But that expectation is seldom expressed openly in fear of
chilling the new spirit of cooperation that marks inter-German
relations.
   East Germany's interim government remains dominated by
communists who oppose efforts that could endanger the sovereignty
of their state.
   But they have indicated support for joint ventures with Western
companies and an openness to foreign investment and that has
stirred the attention of the international business community.
   ``It's too early to tell if there will be a major move of
American business here,'' said Dave Pozorski of the U.S. mission's
economics department. ``But my personal opinion is that it would
make a lot of sense.''
   With 112 million potential consumers in the Warsaw Pact nations
of Eastern Europe, trade and manufacturing companies, especially
from West Germany, are being attracted by the emerging market
opportunities.
   ``The day is coming when Berlin in all practicality will be one
city,'' commented Ralf Schlichting, spokesman for West Berlin's
housing and construction department. ``We don't know when this is
coming, but it is coming.''
   In December, West Berlin officials opened negotiations with East
Berlin authorities on how the two city governments can work
together to resolve their housing, transportation and utilities
problems in the new spirit of cooperation that now prevails.
   Schlichting says East Berlin has at least 30,000 empty
apartments due to last year's mass exodus of young workers and
their families to West Germany. More than 340,000 emigrated in 1989.
   At the same time, West Berlin already has a shortage of 50,000
apartments.
   The opening up of a broad security strip behind the Berlin Wall
has also freed some centrally located property that could be used
for new office construction in East Berlin.
   Much of East Berlin's available housing needs renovation, but if
brought up to Western standards it could be rented out for hard
currency, easing both the economic plight of the East German state
and the dearth of housing in West Berlin.
   Rents in West Berlin are much higher than in East Berlin. A
rent-controlled three-room apartment in West Berlin runs about $300
to $470 a month and $1,200 to $1,300 for an apartment of the same
size on the open market. In East Berlin, housing is heavily
subsidized and renters are charged 3 percent to 5 percent of their
salaries.
   In West Berlin, 1,110 square feet of commercial space _ about
the same size of a three-room apartment here _ rents for about
$1,300 to $1,800 a month.
   The number of apartment seekers mounts daily in West Berlin.
   The shortage has become so severe in recent months that
apartment seekers line up by the hundreds each Saturday afternoon
outside the Berliner Morgenpost office to get hold of the first
copies of the Sunday newspaper and its newest real estate ads.

<HEAD>Denzel Washington Hard To Recognize in Civil War Film</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fact that black soldiers fought in the
American Civil War might come as a revelation to many who see
``Glory.'' One of the film's stars, Denzel Washington, admits that
he was unaware.
   ``I knew absolutely nothing,'' said the actor, who portrays a
bitter, runaway slave. ``I didn't even know that blacks fought in
the Civil War. The American history classes that I took didn't seem
to dwell on that at all. It was inspiring for me; it gave me a lot
of energy to continue research and get further and further into it.
   ``Although the character I play isn't based on a real person, I
kind of put ideas together that I found from reading slave
narratives and things like that.''
   ``Glory'' is partly based on two books about the 54th
Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Infantry _ ``Lay This Laurel'' and
``One Gallant Rush'' _ as well as the letters of Robert Gould Shaw,
the Boston Brahmin who commanded the all-black unit. The script by
Kevin Jarre describes how Shaw had to fight his Army superiors in
order to outfit his soldiers and win battle duty.
   Matthew Broderick portrays Gould, and the soldiers include
Washington, Morgan Freeman, Jihmi Kennedy and Andre Braugher. With
shaved head and scarred face, Washington, the dedicated doctor of
TV's ``St. Elsewhere,'' the martyred Steven Biko of ``Cry Freedom''
and the earnest police chief of ``The Mighty Quinn,'' is scarcely
recognizable.
   ``Someone told me they didn't know I was in the movie,'' the
33-year-old actor said with a smile. ``I wanted to do something
different and to feel removed from the present time. It's difficult
to do a period piece and to give yourself as an actor a different
feeling, as though you're in a different time.''
   One of the ironies of ``Glory'' comes at the climax, when the
54th is sent on the first wave against the impregnable Fort Wagner,
which guarded Charleston harbor. It appears to be a suicide mission.
   ``These men were looking for an opportunity to prove
themselves,'' said Washington. ``The battle was no more dangerous
than their day-to-day lives with the constant threat of slavery and
slave masters with their mentality over their heads. They were
looking for the opportunity to have a fair fight and to have a
rifle as well, regardless of the odds.''
   On July 18, 1863, despite extensive fatigue and poor rations,
the 54th Massachusetts marched across half a mile of sand to lead
the ill-planned attack on Fort Wagner. The regiment lost more than
40 percent of its men, as did the white regiments that followed.
Fort Wagner was never taken by Union soldiers.
   Filmgoers will be shocked by the movie's battle scenes, in which
Confederate and Union soldiers march toward each other and fire
point-blank. The tactic is historically accurate, Washington noted.
   ``This was the first war with new weaponry,'' he said. ``But
they were still using Revolutionary War tactics. The rifles they
used then were less accurate and less powerful. They still fought
the War Between the States, as they call it, with a lot of honor
and regimentation, 100 feet apart, blowing their brains out.''
   Denzel Washington grew up in Mount Vernon, N.Y. He began
studying medicine at Fordham University but soon switched to drama.
After a session at American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco,
he began getting New York jobs. Among them was Joseph Papp's
production of ``Coriolanus,'' with Morgan Freeman in the title
role. ``I had about six lines, like `My, lord, they are coming. ..
.''' he recalled.
   He began in films as George Segal's son in ``Carbon Copy.'' He
then played an angry GI in ``A Soldier's Story,'' and signed on as
Dr. Philip Chandler in ``St. Elsewhere.''
   ``Cry Freedom'' brought him an Academy nomination, but
surprisingly little work. His only offer was for ``The Mighty
Quinn,'' which had a brief release last year despite raves from
critics.
   Now his career is running smoothly. Beside ``Glory,'' for which
he is a likely Oscar candidate, he has completed ``Heart
Condition,'' a wild comedy with Bob Hoskins, and ``Love Supreme,''
a musical from Spike Lee.

<HEAD>For Some Movies, Buck May Stop at Dollar Theaters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>by CHARLES S. RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vicki Peterson, a school teacher and full-time
college student on a tight budget, loves to see movies on the big
screen.
   But with first-run movies going for $5.50 or more, she has
turned to a cheaper alternative _ discount theaters. Running older
movies and sometimes double features, these cost-cutting movie
houses cater to a more dollar-conscious crowd.
   ``I only go to 99-cent movies,'' said Peterson at Paul Sanchez's
four-screen Flowers 99 Cent Theater in Takoma Park, Md., near her
home.
   ``You can bring the whole family,'' said another filmgoer, Stu
Jarboe. ``You don't always have to eat the food and save some
money.''
   But moviegoers such as Peterson and Jarboe might face more
limited choices because of a dispute between Paramount Pictures
Corp. and discount theater operators. Paramount has raised its
rentals, and some operators have responded by ceasing to show
Paramount pictures.
   It's either that, they say, or tell customers that the buck
stops here.
   Since last spring, Paramount has been charging operators $1.05
for each adult ticket and 75 cents for each child's ticket. Prior
to that, the annual charge was a flat 35 percent of gross ticket
sales. Paramount says the new pricing is a more equitable way of
spreading the high cost of making movies.
   However, Paramount's action might threaten the discount theater
industry.
   ``If any of the other companies go ahead with the same type of
thing, discount theaters are either going to have to close or raise
the price,'' says Sanchez, who owns four theaters in the Washington
area.
   Jack Clark, president of the National Association of Discount
Theaters, said the new pricing by Paramount caused him to lose
money when he ran a discount theater in Pullman, Wash.
   He showed ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' and under the
new policy made $1,641 in a week, charging customers $1.50 per
ticket. Under the old price scale from Paramount, he made $3,148 in
a week showing the same movie. Clark said he was $269 in the hole
after expenses with Paramount's new rates.
   Discount theater operators, who number several hundred
nationwide, are fighting back, with a lobbying and public relations
campaign aimed at forcing the company to cut prices.
   Board member Randy Hester of the National Association of
Discount Theaters, a trade organization based in Seattle, urges
moviegoers and even members of Congress to write letters of protest
to Paramount.
   Hester, who owns the Dallas-based Cinemark USA chain, hopes
lawmakers will see what this is going to do to many moviegoers and
will try to take action to stop it.
   ``There are many, many people in the country that can't afford
more than a dollar for a movie ticket,'' he said. ``It wouldn't
take long after visiting a discount theater to see that this is not
the same group of people that are shelling out $5, $6 or $7 for a
first-run movie ticket.''
   There are no lines for movies at dollar theaters. That's because
dollar theaters show movies long after they've had their first run
at pricey movie palaces and multiplexes. Some discount movie
theaters are rundown, with dimly lighted lobbies, worn carpets and
floors sticky from spilled soft drinks and gooey candy.
   That's moviegoer Les Anderson's biggest complaint. ``It costs a
lot in shoes, because they stick to the floor and they don't leave
when you leave.''
   Still, the theaters are havens for the elderly, the poor and
students.
   At the request of the discount theater association, Sen. Howard
M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has asked the Justice Department to
investigate possible antitrust violations, to see if Paramount may
be hiking rates in conjunction with other studios.
   Paramount's pricing system has a negative impact on the poor,
senior citizens and others on fixed incomes, says Metzenbaum, who
is chairman of a subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business
rights.
   Barry London, president of Paramount Pictures, denies any
antitrust violation, saying the company's change in its rental
policy is in no way ``conspiratorial.''
   London says his company is just trying to make discount theaters
bear their fair share of the cost of production, distribution and
marketing. He says the overall success of the movie is ``the engine
that pulls the whole locomotive.''
   Hester, however, considers this a form of buck-passing to the
dollar theaters. He insists the cost of making the movie is already
recovered from many sources.
   ``We pay the film shipping cost both ways. They make no
additional prints for us and give us no money for advertising,'' he
says. ``We get the print after the first-run exhibitor has told us
they can make no more money.''
   He says the higher rental charges are nothing but ``extra
income'' for Paramount. London counters that Hester's charges are
``ridiculous.'' And, he says, dollar movie houses aren't in
business as a public service.
   ``What they're basically doing is using our product to attract
patrons so they can charge them concession prices equivalent to
first-run movie houses,'' he says.
   Concession prices vary from movie house to movie house. Sanchez,
for example, charges $1.50 for popcorn and $1 for drinks. Hester
says his prices are comparable to regular theaters. Clark charged
$1.50 for a large soda and $3.25 for a large popcorn.
   Sales of popcorn and other goodies, London said, generate the
profits that keep the discount theater business popping.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With four wives, hashish-smoking
bodyguards, a black beard and turban to match, Amir Said Ahmad
doesn't look much like a general in Afghanistan's army.
   Clutching a Soviet-made AK-47 automatic rifle, he resembles a
Moslem guerrilla warrior. Two years ago, he was one.
   But after fighting the government and the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan for eight years, Ahmad switched sides and became a
general in the forces he once fought.
   Ideology was not the reason, he said. For Ahmad, it was a
question of who was going to pay him the most and leave him alone.
   ``I don't go with anyone forever,'' he said in an interview in
his expansive guest house in Kabul. ``I only go with the one who
works for my men. When that stops, I switch sides.''
   In exchange for his pledge of allegiance to President Najib,
Ahmad was made a general in Afghanistan's military, a member of
Parliament and given arms, food and hundreds of thousands of
dollars a month for him and his 3,000 men. The government also
promised that his militia group, which controls parts of Herat
province in the west, could continue its business activities there.
   A new Mercedes Benz car and the Kabul guest house were thrown in
for good measure.
   ``I don't know how much money I have but I have too much,''
Ahmad said with a smile. A circle of heavily armed men surrounding
the bearded general clucked approvingly. The chocolate-like smell
of hashish filled the room.
   Ahmad is just one of dozens of former guerrilla commanders who
have left the U.S.-backed mujahedeen, as the guerrillas are known,
and joined the government since Najib announced his ``national
reconciliation'' policy two years ago.
   The policy combines elements of a return to the traditional
Afghan way of solving problems with the ``united front'' policy
used by Communist parties in trouble.
   In the traditional relationship, tribes pledged loyalty to a
central government while retaining autonomy in their local affairs.
The ``united front'' has been traditionally used by Communist
parties that cannot control a country by themselves. With this
strategy, they unite with whomever they can, gain control and then
go after their old allies.
   The policy is an about-face for the ruling People's Democratic
Party of Afghanistan, which came to power in 1978 and attempted to
exert central control over the country and institute a communist
revolution.
   In other areas as well, Najib's ``national reconciliation'' has
halted Afghanistan's communist experiment. Government monopolies on
fuel and sugar transportation were lifted recently and the state
issued a plea to all private traders to help feed the people during
the winter, when food is scarce because of the weather and the war.
The government now denies it is communist. Kabul's mayor, hardline
Marxist Abdul Hakim Misaq, recently said even that traffickers in
stolen goods would not be prosecuted as long as they got the
pilfered goods to the market.
   Diplomats in Kabul, mostly from the Soviet bloc or non-aligned
countries, said the government's attempt to placate the powerful
militias by allowing them to keep their weapons might replace one
problem, civil war, with another, lawlessness. Indeed, the Afghan
tribes are no longer armed with flintlock rifles; heavy weapons
fill their mountain strongholds.
   ``I have tanks, armored personnel carriers, rockets, mortars and
bombs,'' Ahmad said with a great grin. ``If things get difficult, I
can get airplanes, fighter jets, you name it.
   ``In my territory, I am the boss.''
   In Herat, Ahmad is called Amir, which means prince or lord. His
group owns several villages and the largest cement factory in the
province, giving them an effective monopoly on the local
construction industry.
   They also man checkpoints on the main provincial road and, along
with other militia groups, demand payments of food or money from
trucks in exchange for safe passage.
   In Kabul, an Afghan doctor said she treats dozens of gunshot
wounds a month, many of them inflicted by militiamen.
   ``It's like your Wild West,'' said the American-trained
physician, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``These men all want
to be cowboys.''
   Ahmad's family has lived in Herat for generations. After the
1978 revolution, the government attempted to break the power of
local lords like the Ahmad family and launched a radical policy of
land reform.
   Many of the lords went to war. Ahmad joined the mujahedeen,
which means Islamic holy warriors, in their fight to overthrow the
government.
   The arrival of the Soviet army in Afghanistan in December 1979
further galvanized Ahmad's resolve to oppose the Kabul government.
But eight years of fighting hurt his militia band. Ahmad also took
four wives and had eight children.
   ``My children became more important than war,'' he said. ``The
government offered us a good deal. We run our villages ourselves
and have peace. Is that such a strange thing?''

   These days, it seems, if you've got something to
sell there's a buyer in Japan, no matter how big the price tag. So
it's hardly surprising that Japanese collectors of Western art are
on a spending spree. But many insiders in the art world, both at
home and abroad, are disturbed by the trend.

   Japanese speculators are scouring the art world for
the best money can buy, catapulting prices upward with a series of
audacious bids at auction houses in New York and London.
   Many museums and smaller galleries are dismayed, saying they
can't compete.
   This new buying spree is being led by real estate speculators
and bootstrap entrepreneurs such as Yasumichi Morishita, a Japanese
moneylender who made his fortune with high-interest loans and has a
reputation as an aggressive and indiscriminate buyer of art.
   Morishita has been the biggest Japanese buyer in recent months,
dealers say, as he fortifies his stock of Impressionist and
post-Impressionist paintings at his gallery, Aska International.
   Morishita and other Japanese investors spent $230 million in a
series of auctions in November alone.
   Along with individuals enriched by the appreciation of the yen
and ballooning stock and land prices, these new Japanese buyers
have become a strong force in many collectors' markets, from
antique musical instruments to vintage wines.
   Nowhere is this as evident as in the market for Impressionist
and modern paintings, where Japanese dealers and collectors are
snapping up about 40 percent to 50 percent of total sales at
London-based Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses, in some
cases, dealers say, with little regard for quality and price.
   The renewed Japanese appetite for Western art became evident in
1987 when Yasuda Marine and Fire Insurance Co. paid $39.9 million
for Vincent van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' _ at the time the world's
most expensive painting.
   Western collectors still are able to set art-market benchmarks,
such as the $53.9 million sale of Vincent van Gogh's 1889
``Irises'' in 1987 to Australian tycoon Alan Bond _ now the world
record. (Sotheby's announced on Jan. 10 that ``Irises'' is now back
on the auction block.) Also, a Picasso self-portrait ``Yo
Picasso,'' sold last May for $47.85 million to Kentucky executive
Wendell Cherry.
   But in a satellite-linked Tokyo-Paris auction on Nov. 30, a
Japanese resort and auto-racing firm, Nippon Autopolis, nudged
aside Cherry as owner of the world's second most costly painting,
with its $48.9 million knockdown of Picasso's ``Les Noces de
Pierrette.''
   Nippon Autopolis is far from the only Japanese winner of recent
art prizes. Shigeki Kameyama, wealthy owner of Mountain Tortoise
Gallery in Tokyo, set a new record for a living artist with his
$20.68 million purchase of Dutch artist Willem de Kooning's
``Interchange'' in November.
   Morishita made the following buys at auctions in New York and
London:
   _$10 million for one of Picasso's most important early works,
``La Maternite (Motherhood),'' on Nov. 27 in London.
   _$6.8 million for Paul Gauguin's 1889 painting of a Breton boy
in a landscape at a Sotheby's auction on Nov. 28.
   _$25 million out of total sales of $131.29 million from the
estate of the late Campbell Soup heir John T. Dorrance in October,
including $7.15 million for van Gogh's ``Man at Sea.''
   The new Japanese corporate buyers ``are entirely different
players from the owners of small- and medium-sized firms who used
to just collect privately,'' says Kazuko Shiomi, president of
Sotheby's in Tokyo.
   ``Corporations that have made their money in real estate or
financing have become professionals, part of the art industry.''
   Traditional dealers haven't exactly welcomed gruff, no-nonsense
Morishita. Police have investigated his Aichi corporate finance
firm several times, and he received a one-year suspended sentence
in 1986 for falsifying documents used in stock transactions.
   Kiyotaka Kori, Aska's gallery manager and a former secretary to
the tycoon, says Morishita wouldn't mind having a better image.
   ``In some reports, we've got a bad reputation, and Mr. Morishita
doesn't like that,'' Kori said as he relaxed on the Italian silk
couch in Aska's gallery, a bright spot of pastels and chrome beside
a grimy freeway in central Tokyo.
   Morishita, who lives in a brick mansion in one of Tokyo's
toniest neighborhoods, wasn't available for an interview. ``He
really doesn't like having his picture taken,'' said the gallery
manager.

   Kori says Morishita makes a practice of bidding under the house
estimate at auctions, but when he really wants something, ``there's
no limit. Our purpose is to get the painting.
   ``We hope that in the future, if you want to see a Monet or
Renoir, you will go to Aska International.''
   Experts say such do-or-die purchases are underpinning a
worldwide surge in the art market, which has continued unabated
despite shocks in other financial markets, thus inviting still more
investment.
   Sotheby's composite art market index, which set prices at 100 in
1975, had inflated to 911 by late November, up from 732 in the fall
of 1988 and 476 in 1987.
   In areas where Japanese buying is strongest _ Impressionist and
post-Impressionist, modern (1900-1950) and contemporary paintings _
indexes have more than doubled in the past two years to 1,525,
1,415 and 1,945, respectively, in late November.
   ``The market is very, very strong compared with other investment
instruments,'' said Ms. Shiomi of Sotheby's, which has decided to
hold auctions in Japan twice a year.
   Japanese collectors made similar forays into international art
markets in the early 1970s, when the first flush of affluence led
trading firms, among others, to diversify their investments beyond
the tea ceremony bowls they traditionally collected. That first
flirtation with art dealing ended abruptly with the 1973-74 oil
crisis.
   Today, investors like Morishita, who says he has been privately
collecting Western and Japanese art for 30 years, see a market they
expect to continue strong.
   Japan's imports of art, antiques and collectibles quadrupled
from $411.4 million in 1986 to $1.712 billion in 1988, according to
the Finance Ministry.
   In the first nine months of 1989, imports of paintings alone
totaled $1.55 billion, the ministry says.
   Ms. Shiomi attributes the seemingly unquenchable Japanese thirst
for Western art to a desire for a better ``quality of life'' after
decades of hard work and deprivation.
   ``The big tycoons always had big art collections, but after
World War II they reinvested into business instead,'' she says.
``Now we are paying attention to what we are really working for.''
   But longtime members of Japan's exclusive ``Bijutsu (Art) Club''
_ the inner circle of established art dealers _ fear they could be
driven out of the market by upstart newcomers like Aska.
   ``The powerful companies like Aichi (Morishita's finance
company) could wipe us out,'' complains Kazuo Fujii, who says he
started collecting from scratch just after Japan lost World War II.
   ``We've studied art, we've committed our lives to cultivating
our clients. These guys have no commitment. If the market sours in
a couple years, they'll just drop it.''
   Fujii is quick to point out, however, that it isn't just
Japanese tycoons who are driving prices sky high.
   ``Look at the enormous profits the British Railways Pension Fund
has made,'' he says, showing an old catalog detailing how the
British fund acquired art works at modest prices and resold them
for hefty profits.
   So far, traditional dealers such as Fujii haven't fared badly in
the race to capture the best. Many of the cozy galleries in Tokyo's
fashionable Ginza shopping district have fine collections of
Impressionists along with works by Japanese artists.
   Many small museums and galleries scattered throughout the
country are displaying prized Picassos and Monets as Japan goes
through a Western art boom that lures thousands of people in search
of fashionable culture.
   But the spending power of the big buyers far outweighs the
smaller Japanese galleries, Ms. Shiomi says.
   ``Art is just one of their investments,'' she says. ``If they
sell, fine. If they don't, they've still got a nice gallery.''
   In this country, where appearances often are everything,
collecting Western art is one way to acquire a ``nice image, a sign
of understanding things Western and being scholarly,'' Ms. Shiomi
says.
   Nippon Autopolis has bought an expensive veneer of culture _ its
new Picasso _ for an auto-racing theme resort it's building in the
mountains of southern Japan.
   The resort will boast a Formula One auto racing circuit, a
hotel, year-round skiing on artificial snow and a fishing hole, as
well as a museum featuring the Picasso.
   Its aim, the company says, is to ``create a new culture
harmonizing humanity and nature.''

   Billy Wayne Sinclair, convicted killer, knows
his way around Louisiana's Angola Prison. In his 24 years behind
bars, he escaped the electric chair to become a hotshot jailhouse
lawyer and prize-winning journalist, picking up a bride along the
way. But then Sinclair broke the rules of the underworld. He became
a snitch.

<TEXT>
   His life is in ruins, but Billy Wayne
Sinclair is pleased that it also has become downright dull.
   He's had enough ups and downs since the day they clamped
shackles on his wrists and ankles 24 years ago and hauled him off
to Angola State Prison to be executed.
   But the big, rough-hewn electric chair where Sinclair was
supposed to pay the penalty for murder didn't get him.
   Instead, the appeals process dragged on so long Sinclair wound
up among hundreds of condemned men who lucked out when the U.S.
Supreme Court decreed in 1972 that death penalty laws were
unconstitutional.
   In Louisiana, all death sentences of that day were reduced to
life in prison without parole. Though the law was rewritten and
reinstated, it could not apply to them.
   Angola's Dixie Mafia didn't get him either when, 14 years later,
he broke one of the great crooked commandments: Thou Shalt Not
Snitch to the Cops.
   The Dixie Mafia is described by Louisiana state police as a
loosely connected group of traveling thugs who are prone to
violence and operate primarily in the Southeast. It should not be
confused with more-sophisticated organized crime syndicates.
   So here Sinclair stands today at age 45, 6-foot-2 in his
favorite pointy-toed cowboy boots, too lucky to perish in the
copper clasp of ``Old Smokey,'' too quick for the Dixie Mafia, too
felonious to be a free man.
   In the years between his two abortive escape attempts, he
managed quite a career. He was one of the most upwardly mobile
lifers in custody.
   Determined to get out of work in the field or the kitchen, he
read his way to the top, evolving into a hotshot jailhouse lawyer
and co-editor of the prize-winning prison magazine, the monthly
Angolite.
   As a writer, his articles won the George Polk Award and the
Silver Gavel from the American Bar Association, no small potatoes
in the news business.
   He even got married. Since he figured the warden would forbid
such goings on at Angola, he didn't ask. In a style befitting a
smart jailhouse lawyer, it was done by document. A notorized
statement designated a proxy to stand in for him.
   The bride? A Baton Rouge TV reporter he met at the prison while
she was covering a death penalty story.
   ``It was very unromantic,'' his wife, Jodie Sinclair, recalls.
``It took place on June 9, 1982, in the office of a courthouse
clerk in Texas. My brother-in-law stood as Billy's proxy.''
   Somewhere along the way, this four-time loser, convicted of
murdering a store manager during a 1965 holdup in Baton Rouge, grew
a shiny new set of ethics. These even led him to become _ gulp! _ a
friend of the feds.
   His secret dealings with the FBI in 1986 still echo at the
18,000-acre, plantation-style prison _ and triggered a disapproving
New York Times editorial and a critical article in the Columbia
Journalism Review.
   His sin? He told the FBI that the then-chairman of the state
Pardon Board, Howard Marsellus Jr., was selling the ``gold seals''
that every prisoner yearns for.
   ``Gold seal'' is prison slang for the governor's signature
approving a Pardon Board recommendation that a sentence be reduced.
The state seal, applied when the governor signs, is gold in color.
   In tipping the FBI to the scam, Sinclair decided the
investigation was more important than the prison magazine where he
was co-editor, the Times editorial said.
   Word that Sinclair had become a ``snitch'' shattered the
magazine's credibility and left its remaining staffers faced with
skeptical readers and sources, the editorial added.
   Sinclair is big, hawk-nosed, his eyes wary and hooded. Though he
no longer writes for the magazine, the knock on his journalistic
ethics troubles him. And he glumly considers the possibility that
his switch to honesty won't pay any better than crime.
   So far, what it got for him was an emergency transfer out of a
dangerous prison to the placid and relatively comfortable State
Police barracks in Baton Rouge.
   Sinclair looked back on his last prison crisis recently in an
interview at the barracks.
   Rumors that pardons were for sale had been rampant at the prison
for months. Sinclair said that at the time it was just another
layer of the prison corruption that he had been complaining about
to the Department of Corrections for months, with no reaction.
   Confirmation of the pardons scam didn't come until a prison
official took him off to one side and told him he could buy his way
out for $15,000.
   ``He said maybe it might be as much as $20,000, it depended on
the level of Howard's greed,'' Sinclair said. ``He said Howard was
a greedy man.''

   The offer upset him. He was certain it was designed to make him
``dirty'' (incriminate him) or eliminate him as a threat of
exposure. Simply killing him would have brought on too much
attention, he said.
   ``I had one of three choices,'' he said. ``I could have accepted
it and been a free man. My wife and I had that much money. I could
have ignored the offer. Or I could report it.''
   Acceptance went against his new ethics. Ignoring or reporting it
was like blundering into a mine field.
   The course available to a journalist on the outside was closed.
He couldn't develop the information and print it in the magazine as
an expose. The Angolite had a degree of independence, but editors
still had to watch their step.
   And he didn't even know which officials were dirty or clean.
   ``There were a lot of inmates in that prison who had big money
tied up in Marsellus,'' he said. ``If they knew that I knew, I
would have been a dead man, pure and simple.''
   He and his wife conferred by telephone.
   ``The only question was, we didn't know who to turn to. I don't
even know who the hell is involved. I know I am fixing to step on
some big toes. If I give information to the wrong one I'm a dead
man,'' he said.
   When they decided the only safe route was the federal
government, Jodie called a cousin, U.S. Rep. Bill Archer, D-Texas.
He contacted the Department of Justice.
   Four days later, Justice called Jodie. Would she work with FBI
agents in a sting operation? Would she wear a tiny microphone
hidden beneath her clothing so agents could record contract
negotiations? She would.
   However, the FBI recordings and videotapes never saw the light
of a courtroom because the federal sting was superceded by a state
police sting that started a few days later and finished first.
   The state sting swept up Marsellus plus a surprise catch _ state
Rep. Joe Delpit of Baton Rouge, assistant speaker of the House and
political pal of Gov. Edwin Edwards.
   Only Marsellus stayed hooked. He served 20 months on concurrent
five-year sentences for public bribery and conspiracy and federal
charges of mail fraud and conspiracy.
   Delpit's defense at his 1988 state court trial was that he was
conducting his own sting investigation of pardon peddling rumors
when he took $20,000 from the state police undercover agent. He
wept on the witness stand.
   The jury found him innocent of charges of bribery, corrupt
influencing and conspiracy.
   District Attorney Bryan Bush was not happy. ``But as far as I'm
concerned, the case is over,'' he said. ``We all have to live with
the jury's verdict.''
   Sinclair testified before both the state and federal grand
juries in the investigation. With his role now public, his life was
in danger.
   U.S. Attorney Ray Lamonica of Baton Rouge first notified prison
officials to protect Sinclair because he was a federal witness. The
prison-wise Sinclair said the pressure only increased.
   ``I started seeing more and more of those people who had
connections with the Dixie Mafia in my vicinity _ which was
unusual,'' he said.
   ``I had the definite feeling that I was being watched so I could
be set up for a hit. They were trying to get my movements down pat
so they would be able to pick the right place in the prison where
nobody would see me being done in.''
   When Jodie passed this information on to Lamonica, he ordered
two federal marshals to Angola to take Sinclair out.
   ``You can't second-guess on something like that,'' Lamonica said.
   Sinclair said he never made any attempt to ``work a deal'' as a
reward for helping the investigations. In fact, he said, the FBI
cautioned him at the start that he probably was killing any chance
of a commutation of sentence.
   He plans to file a new plea in March seeking a gold seal. But he
and Jodie both assume the chances are slim to none.
   ``I don't believe Billy will ever come home,'' Jodie says.
``Some people say we should have paid the money. A friend of mine
says if this had happened in Mexico I could have paid the money and
thought nothing of it.''
   ``My passion now is to put it all on the record,'' she says.
``We're writing a book _ 276 pages so far. I mailed it off to an
agent in New York last week.''

   It rattles through vistas of empty desert, past
encampments of goat-hair Bedouin tents, past ruined Ottoman
watering stations built of stone, past the relics of wrecked
trains. A ride on the Hejaz railway is a nostalgic trip through an
Arabia of long ago.

<TEXT>
   Railway carriages that escaped Lawrence
of Arabia's desert raids in World War I are again clattering along
the old Hejaz railway, built by the Ottomans' last caliph to carry
pilgrims to Mecca.
   The peeling wood and rattling windows of the 80-year-old
carriages testify to the history of the line and to the regional
turmoil that has kept modernization at bay.
   Jordan and Syria resumed a weekly service on the 138-mile
stretch between Amman and Damascus in October after an eight-year
interruption.
   The engines are modern diesels. But the Belgian-built carriages
and most of the track are the ones that were used when the line was
built.
   They are some of the oldest still in use for a regular passenger
service, rather than as a tourist attraction.
   ``There's no other one like it,'' says Friedrich Pichler, a
widely traveled Austrian railroad consultant who made the
eight-hour trip to Damascus just to ride the train. ``When you
travel on this railroad, it's like people felt in the '20s.''
   The fare too can prompt nostalgia: about $3.50 for first class
and $2.10 for second class.
   The Turkish Sultan Abdel-Hamid conceived the line to ferry
Moslem pilgrims on the annual hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca,
birthplace of the Prophet Mohammed, as well as to cement his rule
over the Ottoman empire's restive Arab provinces.
   Construction on the German-engineered line started in 1900 in
Damascus. It ended in Medina, in what is now Saudi Arabia, eight
years and 810 miles later.
   The Turks matched a unique 105-centimeter narrow gauge used
accidentally on an earlier French line from Beirut to Damascus.
   ``It should have been 1,065 millimeters, but someone cut the
track supports to the wrong width and for reasons of saving money
it was decided to build the line to fit them instead of sending for
new ones,'' says Geoffrey Freeman Allen, editor of Jane's World
Railways in London.
   Turmoil in Turkey and the outbreak of World War I ended plans to
extend the line to Mecca.
   And marauding Arab rebels accompanied by the British officer
T.E. Lawrence, the legendary ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' repeatedly
raided the line during the war to block Turkish supplies.
   British Maj. Sir Hubert Young, who accompanied Lawrence, later
wrote: ``Nothing seemed to give him greater pleasure than to squat
down less than 200 yards from the railway line ... and watch with
complete unconcern the slow approach of a train full of Turkish
soldiers.
   ``As soon as the engine was over the undiscovered mine, he would
jam down the knob of the exploder, retire to his waiting camel and
ride away, hotly pursued by the fire of any soldiers who might have
escaped from the rear carriages.''
   Damaged bridges and wrecked trains derailed by Lawrence,
remarkably preserved in the dry desert air, can still be found
along the old line, mainly in southern Jordan and Saudi Arabia,
where passenger service on the Hejaz stopped years ago.
   The track that once carried pious pilgrims now ferries phosphate
on rebuilt lines through southern Jordan to the port of Aqaba.
   The original track north of Amman forces engineers to hold
speeds to 31 mph on straight stretches and 21{ mph on curves as the
train traces the edge of the vast Arabian desert.
   It rattles through empty vistas of arid land, past encampments
of goat-hair Bedouin tents fragrant with brushwood smoke from fires
for brewing tea, past ruined Ottoman watering stations built of
stone.
   In towns, the rare passage of a train briefly halts normal life.
   Men and women wave from balconies. Soccer players interrupt
their games. Mobs of shrieking children dance and race the
horn-blaring train _ and sometimes even throw stones at it.
   The trip is still a novelty as well to the unusually friendly
customs and immigration officials.
   At the Syrian entry station of Deraa, no bankers awaited
foreigners for the mandatory exchange of currency.
   So cheerful police packed the only two Westerners into the back
of a jeep and raced them 3{ miles to an exchange post. The officers
had to push-start their vehicle on the return leg.
   The future of the eccentric service is in doubt, however:
History is at war with economics.
   Railroad officials say it would be too expensive to renovate the
weather-beaten wooden cars, whose squeaking wall panels sometimes
wiggle independently of their neighbors.
   The odd, small size of the track also makes it impossible to
carry much freight or trains from standard-gauge tracks used
elsewhere.
   Marwan Hadawi, general director of Syria's branch of the
railroad, says Damascus is already preparing the roadbed for a new
standard-gauge track to the Jordanian border.
   The Syrians also are considering using more modern Hungarian
passenger cars to replace the ancient Belgian cars on the run to
Amman. The Hungarian cars already serve Damascus and Deraa daily.
   A 1981 study by German consultants proposed replacing the whole
system with a modern, standard-gauge line. But the $3 billion to $4
billion price tag means that project is at best far in the future.

   Derik Barfield's life went largely unnoticed by
the public. And, at first, so did his death.
   Shot with a handgun during an argument in which a brother was
critically wounded, his slaying on July 17, 1986, rated three short
paragraphs in the next day's edition of the Detroit Free Press.
   It was not a spectacular murder by Detroit standards. After all,
30 other city youths 18 or younger were shot to death that year.
   Today, Derik Barfield's funeral program is one of a dozen tacked
to a cork board in a cluttered office in a century-old schoolhouse
near the Cass Corridor, Detroit's Skid Row.
   On another wall are two-dozen plaques, including one etched with
his name and those of the 30 other youths killed by gunfire in 1986.
   This is the part-time office of Clementine Barfield, 38, who
helped found an organization called Save Our Sons and Daughters
several months after the death of the third of her four children.
She's a busy woman this morning.
   Plans for a week-long anti-violence program at Martin Luther
King High School and a neighborhood anti-drug march are in the
works.
   In the afternoon, she will accompany another mother to a state
juvenile prison to visit the young killer of the woman's son. ``She
wants to talk to him and help him get his life straightened out,''
Barfield says.
   ``We are people who have been through hell ourselves, but we are
willing to put it aside, take a stand and say, `We have got to do
something,''' she adds.
   At the core of SOSAD is Barfield and six other mothers of slain
youths who organized the group in early 1987 with about 90 other
Detroiters. Citizen volunteers, clergy and city and school
officials have joined in SOSAD's dual purpose of comforting
grieving families and working to prevent violence by and against
the city's children.
   ``In the black community, bereavement support is not something
we normally reach out for,'' Barfield says. ``The norm is for
people to lock themselves in their house and feel like they're the
only one who feels this badly. But we have over 130 families in
SOSAD, families that have reached out.''
   SOSAD provides weekly support groups, workshops on grief, stress
management classes and a 24-hour hot line.
   The organization also holds an anti-handgun vigil every Monday
at the City-County Building and has sponsored rallies, marches and
memorial services.
   ``Wherever I go, kids are stopping me and saying, `You're that
lady about the kids getting killed,''' says Barfield, who also
works full time in the city Finance Department.
   SOSAD is developing chapters in Flint and Pontiac. It has had
requests for organizational help from Milwaukee, St. Louis,
Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Columbus, Ohio, and Omaha, Neb.
   ``Soon we will be a national organization, or, rather, other
people will start their own chapters,'' Barfield says. ``If they
call themselves SOSAD they'll be looking to us for organization,
and I don't want to take on all that. Right now we don't have the
resources.''
   SOSAD is sustained mainly by small donations and grants from the
state and city. The group has yet to receive corporate or
foundation support.
   ``Grass-roots organizations usually are started by people who
have a lot of love and a lot of commitment, but it doesn't know how
to sustain itself,'' Barfield says. ``Without money, the group will
die out, but our emphasis has never been on money. Our emphasis is
on commitment.''
   Barfield said her own commitment hasn't flagged, but she's had
to begin picking and choosing her activities. For example, she no
longer attends funerals, something she used to do two or three
times a week.
   ``I've heard so many crying mothers, seen so many dead
children,'' she says. ``After a while, all the faces started to
look alike. The pain is the same, the hurt is the same.
   ``I don't want to keep looking at that. I want to look at
solutions, look at alternatives.''
   Solutions, if any, are hard to assess.
   From Jan. 1 through Nov. 12 of 1989 there were 229 shootings of
Detroit children 16 or under, 28 of them fatal, according to police
statistics. There were 308 such shootings, 55 of them fatal, for
all of 1988.
   ``It's kind of hard to measure the impact,'' Barfield says.
``But when you look at the statistics and see homicides among young
people are going down, you have to feel encouraged _ and it's not
just because of SOSAD.''
   SOSAD has worked only indirectly with the Detroit Police
Department, says Cmdr. Dorothy Knox, head of the department's
Community Services Division. But the group has been an important
influence on other community organizations, she says.
   ``You have to start somewhere, and if it gets the public up in
arms, then it's meeting its purpose,'' Knox says.
   Jesse Harrison, who shot Derik Barfield between the eyes with a
handgun he bought for $25, spent slightly more than two years in a
state prison and was released in December 1988.
   ``I can't heal as long as I'm talking about it every day, so the
healing process is not just something I can work through,''
Clementine Barfield says. ``But I know I've been instrumental in
helping some children, and it helps to know I haven't lost my son
for nothing.''
   SOSAD's dual purpose of support for bereaved families and
anti-violence advocacy may be unique in the United States, says
Marjolijn Bijlefeld, associate director of the Washington,
D.C.-based Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.
   ``I don't know of anyone like Clem Barfield, who has taken it on
and continued long after other parents have quit a support group,''
Bijlefeld says.
   The coalition itself tried without success to start a support
network for grieving families, she said.
   ``People who are willing to talk about it generally are very
willing to talk about it immediately afterward,'' she says. ``But
it's hard to sustain it. People who have lost a child seven or
eight years ago don't always want to keep going with it. There's a
lot of attrition.''
   ``I can't afford to burn out,'' Barfield says. ``I have to keep
the fire burning. But I'm pushing for others to pick up the torch.''

   Scuba divers have a lot of things to explore,
from coral reefs to shipwrecks, oil rigs to underground caves. But
an abandoned mine? Yes, right in the heart of the Midwest a
now-flooded lead mine is beckoning divers with a different kind of
scenery.

<DATELINE>BONNE TERRE, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Far beneath the general store and the
gas station in this little Midwestern town lies a water wonderland.
   Scuba diving, a sport usually associated with the tropics, has
come to Missouri. And the ``Billion Gallon Lake Resort,'' converted
from a long-abandoned lead mine, may be its most unusual attraction.
   ``It's like diving through a ghost town, or a shipwreck,'' says
scuba instructor Doug Goergens, who along with his wife, Cathy,
owns the flooded mine, now billed as the largest freshwater dive
resort in the world. ``Or like soaring through a cathedral. It's an
awe-inspiring experience.''
   Goergens' superlatives can be discounted to a certain extent,
since he has a vested interest. He says he's invested about $1
million in the project.
   But Jacques Cousteau's son, Jean Michel, was impressed. The son
of the man credited as being one of the inventors of scuba
(Self-contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus) in the 1940s, gave
the resort rave reviews.
   And Skin Diver magazine has touted the mine as ``a time capsule,
an engineering marvel, and an unbeatable weekend getaway.''
   Bonne Terre, or ``good earth'' in French, is a town of about
3,500 people about 60 miles south of St. Louis. Last year the mine
tapped into the landlocked Midwestern scuba market for relatively
low-cost, weekend-only forays, attracting 15,000 customers.
   The lake was formed when the owners of St. Joseph Mining Co.,
once the provider of jobs to 5,000, closed operations and shut off
the water pumps. Natural seepage of spring and rainwater flooded
the mine.
   Marian Rivman, a spokeswoman for the Diving Equipment
Manufacturers Association, an organization that monitors the
industry, says Bonne Terre is unique.
   ``People are diving everywhere,'' says Rivman, known in the
industry as the ``Scuba Lady.'' ``But inland, there's nothing
comparable to the mine. It's a great destination.''
   Beauty, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. And the avid
scuba fan has other attractions to explore in the United States,
among them shipwrecks off the coast of North Carolina, oil rigs in
the Gulf of Mexico or the kelp forests of California.
   The Florida Keys are perhaps the prime U.S. destination for the
estimated 2.65 million active scuba divers in the United States,
offering warm water, coral and fish. Divers also can investigate
lakes, quarries and rivers, although visibility often is severely
limited.
   Such is the case at Lake Norfork, Ark., a 500-mile round trip
from St. Louis where Goergens used to take his scuba students.
   ``Diving can be very, very inconvenient,'' Goergens says.
   He's put a lot of work into removing that negative aspect at the
Bonne Terre operation, illuminating the mine with 300,000 watts of
lighting and installing showers and locker rooms.
   The mine, once the world's largest producer of lead, has the
craggy look of a lunar landscape. Jackhammers silent since the mine
closed in 1961 jut out of solid rock. Scattered picks, shovels,
ladders and helmets also were left behind, and their presence adds
to the surreal surroundings.
   The lake is pale blue and crystal clear, with visibility more
than 100 feet in lighting conditions Goergens describes as ``late
afternoon,'' although it appears to be closer to dusk.
   Unlike other diving environs, the subterranean lake is devoid of
life forms _ no sharks to worry about here _ and other distractions
such as current, surges or tidal rushes. A constant water
temperature of 58 degrees, a little chilly but bearable in a wet
suit, makes it a year-round resort.
   When Goergens first dived in the mine in 1974 he described it as
a ``dark, scary place.'' He saw potential, though, as a training
ground for the 1,200 to 1,500 students his St. Louis company, West
End Diving Centers, certifies annually.
   It has turned out to be much more. To accommodate the divers
that now flock to Bonne Terre, the Goergenses renovated a mansion
once owned by the president of the mine and turned it into a
country inn. They also transformed an old, ramshackle, train depot
into a saloon and bed-and-breakfast inn, and their work, in part,
has sparked renewed interest in tourism on the part of civic
leaders.
   Goergens, who opened the mine to the public in 1981, believes
more wonders may be in store. There are now 24 trails to explore,
but only four of the 17 miles of flooded tunnels, which would allow
the entire town of Bonne Terre to fit inside, have been developed
so far.

   It wasn't a cowboy who first wrote that someone
``bit the dust.'' That's from Homer's ``Iliad.'' But America's
riders of the range are beginning to let others know that they,
too, have a way with words, thanks in large part to an annual
gathering of cowboy poets in Nevada.

<TEXT>
   Cowboy poets who once practiced their art mainly in bunkhouses
and bars and at family gatherings have extended their stage across
America in recent years, appearing on national television and the
banquet circuit.
   Cowboy poetry has existed as long as there have been cowboys.
Several old songs began as cowboy verse and the earliest books of
cowboy poems were published as early as the 19th century.
   But it didn't really attract a wide audience until January 1985
when Hal Cannon, former state folklorist in Utah, organized with
several others the Cowboy Poets Gathering in Elko, Nev., now an
annual event held every January.
   ``Cowboy poetry was a part of American folklore but it had
almost no exposure,'' says Cannon, who has become the director of
the Western Folk Life Center in Salt Lake City. ``America didn't
know about the poetic cowboy.
   ``So we all started thinking about it. We started looking around
our own states and found that almost everyone who interprets the
cowboy is an outsider. Movie makers, TV producers, journalists,
artists, folklorists.
   ``The cowboy hadn't really had a chance to tell his own story.
He really didn't have a public forum.''
   Baxter Black of Henderson, Colo., considered to be the only such
poet who derives his entire income from rhyme, says audiences find
Western poetry enchanting because of the cowboy's independent image.
   ``He has a physical job,'' Black says. ``He's outdoors. He's
placing himself against the elements with the mythical Code of the
West to guide him. When the chips are down, this is the person you
want to stand beside you.''
   Black, who has traveled the banquet circuit for years with
stopovers in such places as Muleshoe, Texas, says acceptance from
the general public began with that first poetry gathering in Elko.
   Before the poets went public, Cannon says, ``the only place you
really heard them was in bars or cow camps. They were pretty
private sessions.''
   Cowboys and ranchers first published their poetic works as early
as 1880, he says, but, ``It just never got out to the public.''
   The public exposure has brought out ``several hundred'' other
cowboy poets, some better than others.
   ``The quality ranges from bad to great,'' Cannon says.
   Buck Ramsey of Amarillo, Texas, one of the newcomers to the
cowboy poet circle, is considered by Cannon to be one of the best.
   ``When I hear Buck Ramsey recite his poetry, I'm much more moved
than when I see someone throw his hat all around the stage,''
Cannon says.
   Performance, which includes gestures, facial expressions and
tone of voice, sometimes overshadows the content at cowboy poetry
readings.
   Ramsey's verse is straightforward with no histrionics. Asked for
a couplet about a cowboy poet, Ramsey replied:
   ```He'd do to ride the river with,'
   ``I'd have you say of me.
   ``And if I lived to fit the words,
   ``I'd be all I should be.''
   Waddy Mitchell, a ranch foreman near Elko who also has found
national prominence as a cowboy poet, estimates participation since
the first gathering has increased 2,000 percent.
   Mitchell has appeared on several television specials and toured
recently with country singer Michael Martin Murphy, to places like
Martha's Vineyard, Mass., and Miami.
   Black, who acts as his own business manager and limits his
appearances off the banquet circuit to about five a year, has been
a guest on the Johnny Carson show twice.
   Other poets have begun to fill in as headliners at dinners,
banquets and conventions throughout the West.
   Cannon is preparing an anthology of cowboy poetry that will
include some of Ramsey's work.
   Ramsey, injured in a bronc-riding accident on a Texas Panhandle
ranch in 1963, has written non-fiction for Southwestern
publications for years. He believes many cowboys are far
better-educated in literature than most people realize.
   Some of the cowboy language comes from such classics as Homer's
``The Iliad.''
   Homer referred to a breaker of horses 56 times in his classic
work, Ramsey says. It also produced the term ``bit the dust.''
   The ``Bull Durham'' classics also supplemented the cowboys'
literary understanding.
   ``Back before the turn of the century, you could send a dime off
with a tag off a Bull Durham tobacco sack and get one of the 303
classics,'' Ramsey says. ``The set included all of the great
literature from Homer up through the American writers.''
   Ramsey wrote poems as a young cowboy along the Canadian River
breaks.
   In later years, ``I would see someone like Baxter or Waddy on TV
saying their poems and the old poems were running through my mind.
After I saw them, I decided to write my poems down.''
   Ramsey, Mitchell says, is ``a jewel of a guy and a good
storyteller. And a pretty good guitar picker.''

   Elke Sommer, the glamorous German-born actress
who has appeared in more than 60 movies, once wouldn't tolerate any
distractions while she was on the stage.
   That was before she made her New York acting debut in the title
role of ``Tamara,'' a play in which she moves about the Seventh
Regiment Armory with the audience in somewhat noisy pursuit.
   Tamara, a glamorous Parisian artist, arrives at an Italian
patriot-poet's villa in 1927 to paint him, then finds that he is a
fascist and a seducer.
   Not only do the 10 actors playing the villa's residents travel
from room to room, but the audience sweeps along behind them, going
hither or thither, depending on which character they've decided to
follow.
   The main floor of the Seventh Regiment Armory serves as the
villa's main hall, dining room and Tamara's bedroom. Upstairs are
other bedrooms and in the basement are the kitchen and servants'
quarters. Quiet it's not.
   At times there have been a book fair, antique show and soldiers
marching in other parts of the Armory.
   The audience, standing in the same room with the actors,
sometimes jump in.
   ``Yesterday,'' Sommer says, ``I said, `Luisa, Luisa.' A little
boy pulled on my coat, `There she is.' I said, `Gee, thanks.' I was
crying in one scene and a lady gave me her handkerchief. I took it.
   ``I'm an actor who, if there is any noise or distractions, I go
insane and have screaming fits. Now I could work on a battlefield.''
   Sommer, who joined the cast of ``Tamara'' two weeks before its
Dec. 2 second anniversary, has made more than 60 movies, including
``A Shot in the Dark,'' ``The Money Trap,'' ``The Art of Love'' and
``The Oscar.''
   She calls herself a workaholic. ``Once I didn't work for two
months and I thought, `Nobody wants me any more.' A week later
something came and I complained again, `Oh, no, eight shows a
week.' If I know I have something ahead, I'm fine.''
   She worked hard in school, studying Latin and Greek. ``Teaching
old languages and history would have interested me, but both would
have taken many more semesters and we had no money,'' she says. ``I
decided I would learn modern languages and go into the diplomatic
service.''
   To polish her English, she went to England as an au pair. The
family moved to Italy and asked her to help with the children while
they settled in.
   ``I got invited by a boy to go dancing one night,'' she recalls.
``Vittorio de Sica's right-hand man saw me.
   ``I didn't have any desire to be an actress nor was I the
slightest bit lured by whatever glamour people think there is. I
was going to go back to Germany and take Russian.''
   De Sica put her in ``A Friend of the Jaguar,'' a comedy he
directed, then in a comedy he starred in, ``Men and Noblemen.'' It
took six weeks.
   ``I thought it was a silly way to make a living,'' Sommer says.
   ``Somebody saw a picture of me in a paper in Berlin, a German
girl in Italy. He flew down and offered me a three-picture
contract.'' Then it was back to Italy for three movies, to England
for one more, to France for three more. ``Then I did `The Victors'
for Carl Foreman. It was shot in Europe but was the first American
picture I did, with an all-star cast.
   ``I always looked with one eye on the possibility of going back
to the university for a long time. When I had spent nearly three
years in the business, I thought: `My goodness, this is going to be
your work. You'd better do something about it.' I took voice
lessons.''
   Sommer was brought to America for ``The Price'' with Paul
Newman. She and Sharon Tate ``were clad beautifully and had very
little acting to do'' in ``The Wrecking Crew.''
   ``I was always supposed to be glamorous _ which is a big pain in
the neck,'' she says. ``Everybody expects this wonderfully groomed
person to come out, which is not me at all. It's a terrible effort
every time.
   ``I just finished `F14,' in which I play a farm lady without any
makeup. It's a story about a French-German bullet train that's
going to destroy the last bit of beauty we have.''
   ``I love my job with my soul and heart but only since I started
doing stage work 19 years ago,'' Sommer says. She has frequently
acted at the Drury Lane in Chicago, winning the Jefferson Award for
``Born Yesterday.'' She also has toured in plays in America and
German-speaking Europe.
   In 1964 Sommer married author Joe Hyams, the first person who
interviewed her in America. Three years ago she was pregnant with
twins and lost them.
   ``That was the toughest thing that happened in my life, I
think,'' she says.
   She and Hyams are now separated.

   Unlike the naive Hollywood agent he plays on
``The Famous Teddy Z,'' Jon Cryer knows a thing or two about show
business.
   In the CBS comedy series, Cryer's character, Teddy Zakalokis,
went overnight from a job in the mailroom at an ad agency to become
a big talent agent. It's a fluke. Teddy hasn't a clue how it
happened. He doesn't know how to ``take a meeting'' or ``do
lunch,'' and as far as he knows CMA and CAA are government agencies
rather than talent agencies.
   Cryer, on the other hand, was born into a show business family
and was virtually raised backstage. Prior to the debut of the
series in September, Cryer had starred on Broadway and in movies.
   ``I grew up backstage and was fascinated by it,'' Cryer says.
``I felt at home backstage. I felt at home working on the stage. I
loved being in the theater. People were always flamboyant,
interesting and intelligent.''
   Cryer's father, David Cryer, starred on Broadway in ``Evita'' as
well as ``1776.'' His mother, Gretchen Cryer, is a playwright and
actress. She wrote and starred in ``I'm Getting My Act Together And
Taking It On the Road'' and has a new musical for 1991.
   ``My parents didn't want me to be an actor. They wanted me to be
a professional so I could count on making a living. They went
through a lot of tough times before making it.''
   It's also been a shaky ride for ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' created
by Hugh Wilson, the man behind ``WKRP in Cincinnati'' and ``Frank's
Place.'' It's the lowest-rated of the CBS Monday night shows, none
of which regularly make the Top 20 in the Nielsen list.
   This week was the show's last appearance on Monday night. CBS
said it would return soon in a new time slot.
   The show's taken some hysterical jabs at Hollywood. Alex Rocco's
portrayal of a frantic, grasping agent is so funny that several
real agents have claimed they are the model. Still, it may be too
inside for most of the audience, and historically series with a
show business background have not done well.
   The series is loosely based on the early career of Jay Kanter, a
motion picture executive who began as an agent. He went from the
mailroom at a major talent agency to agent after he was sent to
pick up Marlon Brando at the airport and the actor took a liking to
him. Which is what happens to Teddy when he has to pick up actor
Harland Keyvo.
   ``The difference is that Kanter was not the naive kid that Teddy
is,'' Cryer says. ``I met him when he was the head of MGM a few
years ago.''
   On the show, Teddy is intimidated by his secretary, played by
Jane Sibbett. She's a college-educated aspiring agent who was his
rival when they were both in the mailroom at the agency.
   ``She knows what she's doing,'' says Cryer. ``She's better
suited for the job than he is.''
   In real life, Cryer and Sibbett have been dating for the past
nine months.
   ``Teddy's becoming a little less naive,'' he says. ``But he'll
always be the innocent among the sharks. They're also allowing him
to be a little more funny, rather than having just the people
around him be funny.''
   In the fall, Cryer and his father, a regular on the soap opera
``As the World Turns,'' did a joint photo session in New York for
their CBS shows.
   ``We did work together once in a benefit for the Mirror
Repertory in New York,'' Cryer says. ``I'm not much of a singer,
but Dad's a wonderful singer. I didn't want to turn him down since
it was a father-son theme. Of course, Dad forgot the words.''
   On the same occasion he also acquired the fake nose Derek Jacobi
wore in a production of ``Cyrano de Bergerac.''
   ``It was in the benefit auction,'' he says. ``I didn't want to
bid but my father nudged me and said one of the Rockefellers was in
the audience and he wasn't going to be outbid by a 19-year-old. It
cost me $500. I have it on a bookshelf with a spotlight on it.''
   Cryer attended the Royal Academy of the Dramatic Arts in London
during his high school vacations. He made his Broadway debut in
``Brighton Beach Memoirs'' in his senior year. His film debut was
``O.C. and Stiggs,'' and his first starring role was opposite Demi
Moore in ``No Small Affair.'' He's also starred in ``Pretty in
Pink,'' ``Superman IV,'' ``Hiding Out'' and ``Dudes.''
   Before the series, he'd done some television: an episode of
``Amazing Stories'' and the American Playhouse production of ``Noon
Wine.''

   Today is Sunday, Jan. 21, the 21st day of 1990. There are 344
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Jan. 21, 1793, King Louis XVI of France was executed by the
guillotine.
   On this date:
   In 1861, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi and four other
Southerners resigned from the U.S. Senate.
   In 1908, New York City enacted an ordinance that made smoking in
public by women punishable by a fine of $5 to $25 and up to ten
days' imprisonment.
   In 1915, the first Kiwanis Club was founded, in Detroit.

<HEAD>Powers Boothe Sees Spy John Walker Jr. as a Mercenary</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Miniseries to be broadcast Feb. 4 and 6.</NOTE>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Powers Boothe says he saw his role as John
Walker Jr. in CBS's ``Family of Spies: The Walker Spy Ring'' as a
man who sold out his country for the money.
   Over two decades, Walker's espionage organization provided
enough secrets to Moscow to change the balance of power between the
Soviet Union and the United States, defense analysts say.
   ``His pattern didn't fit into any normal patterns for
espionage,'' said Boothe of the former Navy communications
specialist. ``He walked into the Soviet Embassy in Washington and
volunteered his services. He wasn't recruited. He wasn't mad at the
government or the military. He just did it for the money. I always
thought spies were politically motivated. His motivation was greed.
It was the American dream gone awry.
   ``Walker said, `I served my government very well and the Soviet
government very well.' I think after a number of years he convinced
himself his actions were making the world a safer place. But I
think it was just a business with him.''
   The two-part, five-hour miniseries, which also stars Lesley Ann
Warren as Walker's wife, Barbara, will be telecast by CBS on Sunday
and Tuesday. Stephen Gyllenhaal directed from a screenplay by
Richard DeLong Adams, based on two books, ``Family of Spies: Inside
the John Walker Spy Ring'' by Pete Earley and ``I Pledge Allegiance
...'' by Howard Blum.
   It begins in 1967, when Walker was a senior chief petty officer
working in communications aboard the submarine USS John Paul Jones
in Charleston, S.C. Over the years, he recruited his best friend,
his brother and a son as he lived a playboy lifestyle. With his
agents in place, Walker retired from the Navy and also divorced his
wife.
   Boothe said he believed Walker recruited his son in order to
give him a legacy. Walker found stealing secrets so easy he said
convenience stores had tighter security.
   It was filmed with ``limited cooperation'' from the Navy despite
its embarrassment to the service. The production company did not go
aboard any ships, but ships at the Long Beach Naval Station were
used as a backdrop.
   The miniseries was also filmed partly on location in Vienna,
Austria. The city is a gathering place for spies and is especially
popular with Russians, Boothe said. Walker went there frequently.
   ``I firmly believe that if his wife had not thought he had
failed to pay her some money he owed her he'd still be doing it,''
said Boothe. ``She turned him in. No one was on to him.''
   Although Walker was a traitor, Boothe didn't play him as a
villain.
   ``You have to put aside your personal feelings,'' he said. ``As
an actor you have to convince people you're not a bad person. If I
played Walker as dark and evil he wouldn't be believable and people
would lose interest.
   ``Walker was very smart, very charming and somewhat paranoid. He
was extremely efficient and everyone liked him. In port, everyone
wanted to go where he went because he knew all the good places. He
said the only chink in his armor was his wife. It turned out to be
true.''
   Boothe won an Emmy for portraying another evil and tragic
character, the Rev. Jim Jones in the 1980 TV movie ``Guyana
Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones.'' Jones was a charismatic cult
leader who persuaded 900 of his followers to commit mass suicide in
the 1970s.
   He starred as private eye Philip Marlowe in 11 episodes of
``Chandlertown'' made for HBO in England and Canada based on short
stories by Raymond Chandler.
   He will also be seen in the HBO movie ``Grand Tour,'' which he
described as a modern day ``Fail-Safe.'' James Earl Jones, Martin
Landau and Rebecca DeMornay also star.
   ``A missile is launched from Turkey toward Russia,'' he said.
``They launch a small strike toward us. The Soviet premier calls
the American president and tells him the strike was launched by
dissidents protesting glasnost. But, can he be trusted?
   ``I play the commander of a group of B-52 bombers. The movie is
really about each man's decision. Do you go ahead or not, knowing
the world is about to be blown up?''

   ``Halloween 5 _ The Revenge of Michael Myers'' (CBS-Fox Home
Video. VHS-Beta. Rated R. For rental market.)
   
   This is a really inferior film.
   Like others of the teen-age slice-and-dice genre, ``Halloween
5'' requires a knowledge of the series to know what's going on. It
never really suggests what the heck it is Michael's avenging.
   No great loss, for the cinematic slaughter of sexually
precocious teen-agers has become as stylized as Jacobean tragedy.
   ``Halloween 5'' is set in the curiously empty suburb that has
more than its share of nubile teen-agers with too much disposable
income. It opens with a flashback of Michael being run over by a
car and blown down a handy abandoned mineshaft, his chest full of
buckshot from the shotguns of the never-prompt police.
   ``One Year Later'' the subtitle says, and we dissolve to
waiflike 9-year-old Jamie, a traumatic mute and inmate of the local
home for disturbed children. She is reliving the psychological
domination of Michael, her uncle and, um, psychic twin, that drove
her to juke her step-Mommy in the bathtub.
   Her visitors are perky, attractive teen-age girls who are
friends or relatives or something, blithely preparing for a teen
Halloween party.
   That's right, a Halloween party in a town that has seen so much
annual slaughter on the night that anywhere else the streets would
be crowded with police, National Guardsmen and reporters angling
for the ``Haddonfield: One Year After Slaughter'' story.
   Ah, but we're not here for logic. We're here for the numbingly
predictable series of false starts, cheap frights and intermittent,
painstakingly overdubbed stabbings that lead up to Michael's real
horror.
   In ``5,'' as in ``1,'' ``2,'' ``3'' and ``4,'' Michael's task is
to murder teen-agers who indulge in casual sex. That's the point of
this movie, kids. Make love and you die. Kiss, kiss, hack, hack,
stab, chop, die.
   This is the 1990s, though, and the socially responsible
filmmakers of ``Halloween 5'' give us this line at an intimate
moment: She says, ``I didn't ... BRING ... anything ...'' and he
produces a condom.
   ``Halloween 5'' was written by Michael Jacobs, Shem Bitterman
and Dominique Othenin-Girard, and directed by Othenin-Girard. Maybe
Michael could go after them in ``Halloween 6.''
   What's alarming about this unfrightening, stupid teen screamer,
though, is that its real heroine is a 9-year-old girl. And that
means the makers of this product are relying on cable and the
ubiquitous videocassette to get ``Halloween 5'' before an even
younger audience.
   Now THAT'S scary.

   ``Renegades'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R.)
   
   Don't waste your time on Lou Diamond Phillips and Kiefer
Sutherland's ``buddy movie,'' which strings together witless chase
scenes, cartoon violence and surreal gunfights that blow everything
away.
   Phillips plays the young Indian who accompanies a sacred Lakota
artifact to a museum in Philadelphia. Sutherland plays the young
policeman trying to infiltrate a young mobster's gang.
   During a botched jewel robbery in which the policeman is an
unwilling participant, the spear is stolen and the Indian's brother
is killed. Thus the two are joined in a mutual quest, their initial
hostility and mistrust eventually growing into ... aw, you know.
   The movie gets unlikelier, but to cite the improbabilities would
open this reviewer to a charge of sarcasm. Writer David Rich and
director Jack Sholder certainly didn't have irony in mind.
   Boring.

   ``Long Hard Look'' (Atlantic) _ Lou Gramm
   
   From a murmur to a scream, Lou Gramm sings it all.
   Unfortunately, there isn't much to scream about on ``Long Hard
Look,'' the second solo effort from Foreigner's lead singer. It's
passable rock 'n' roll, but that's about it.
   Most of this LP testifies only that the artist is overqualified
for the job. Gramm's powerful voice soars, sighs and blasts what he
calls ``positive aggression.''
   But if his voice were lifted out of these songs, they'd only be
good enough for a low-grade beer commercial. You can't make gold
out of dross, but you might make a gold album.
   The rockers on ``Long Hard Look'' sound calculated to appeal to
teen-agers. They're all swagger and no substance, just like a high
school jock trying to impress the girls. ``Hangin' on My Hip'' is
the worst offender _ complete with requisite macho man guitar solo
histrionics.
   So Gramm tries hard to rock hard. Sometimes it takes more
strength to be soft. The ballads (remember, these are rock ballads)
shine brighter than the rockers. ``Just Between You and Me'' is
already a Top 5 single, and ``Warmest Rising Sun'' and ``True Blue
Love'' also have potential.
   On ``Sun,'' a koto gives a glint of Japanese musical tradition.
In passages, the voices of Gramm and a choir including Merry
Clayton and Siedah Garrett ascend in reverie like a sunrise. It
recalls the soulful depth Gramm displayed on Foreigner's 1985 hit
``I Want to Know What Love Is.''
   Gramm co-wrote all but one of the songs with producer Peter Wolf
(not the Peter Wolf of the J. Geils Band) and others.
   On ``Long Hard Look,'' Gramm is a rock 'n' roll thoroughbred
running on a dog track. It is hoped that his next effort, whether
solo or with Foreigner, will match some industrial strength
material with his powerful voice.

   ``Trouble Walkin''' (Atlantic-Megaforce) _ Ace Frehley
   
   It's fast, it's loud, it's Ace Frehley.
   That's about all anyone needs to know about ``Trouble Walkin',''
the ex-Kiss-er's latest album.
   Here's heavy metal for the kids, many of whom weren't even alive
when Frehley and Kiss were at their glam-metal peak. For those who
missed Kiss' platform boot-kicking days, ``Trouble Walkin'''
features contributions from ex-Kiss men Peter Criss (the cat-faced
one) and Paul Stanley (the star-eyed one).
   Criss lends backing vocals and percussion, while Stanley is
co-writer of ``Hide Your Heart.'' It's been 10 years since Frehley
(the comet-eyed one) and Criss last worked together.
   ``Trouble Walkin''' might be hard rock, but it's tame compared
to bands such as Guns n' Roses, Metallica or Iron Maiden. There
isn't any devil-worshiping hype, gruesome cover art,
racist-homophobic lyrics or caterwauling vocals a la Axl Rose of
the Gunners.
   Frehley just wants to ``rock this town,'' as he sings in ``Shot
Full of Rock.''
   He does it best on a cover of ELO's ``Do Ya.''
   Frehley does a little double entendre in the card-playing tale
of ``Five Card Stud,'' and in the hymn to adolescent hormones,
``Back to School'' (``I grade on a curve'').
   He's got a couple of boys-with-guns songs. ``2 Young 2 Die''
includes a cliched line about ``(ripping) down society's walls''
that'll probably appeal to Alienated Teens.
   But he changes his tune with ``Remember Me.'' A softer, bluesy
track, the song has Frehley joining rock's social consciousness
bandwagon.
   ``Your guns and bombs keep rolling off the assembly line, And
people keep on starving and they think that's just fine,''
criticizes the heavenly narrator. ``We need some loving and caring,
And kissing and hugging, And helping each other.''
   Who says you can't mix ``guns n' hugs''?

<HEAD>Star Watch: A Life-Changing Experience for Robert Loggia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``It knocks you to your knees,'' says Robert
Loggia of the experience of filming a movie about the Holocaust in
the actual concentration camp where the atrocities took place 45
years ago.
   Loggia appears with Willem Dafoe and Edward James Olmos in the
new film ``Triumph of the Spirit,'' based on the true story of a
family of Greek Jews, one of whom survived wartime horror by boxing
for the sport of his Nazi captors. The producers were able to get
permission to film at Auschwitz.
   ``It was a life-changing experience for everyone,'' said Loggia.
``I know what it was for me, and I know what it was for virtually
the entire cast.
   ``I suppose having a glimpse into the nadir of man's soul tests
your faith in man and his basic goodness, which we all want to hold
on to. You say why did this happen?
   ``In my lifetime I have heard all the stories. My father was in
World War I, and I heard about the trenches and the gassing, the
killing, the bayoneting. I'm a student of history, and I know the
nature of our own Civil War, which was brutal, brother against
brother. I was in the Korean War myself; although I didn't see
action; I followed the brutality of it, and of Vietnam, the
defoliation and the bombings.
   ``Man is a pretty miserable creature in the destruction he can
vent on his fellow man,'' the actor said. ``So you say, what made
the Holocaust so special? ... Perhaps it was the premeditated
attempt for total genocide, to wipe a culture and a people who have
contributed so much to civilization _ perhaps per capita more than
any other ethnic group.''
   In ``Triumph of the Spirit'' Loggia plays the father of a
Salonika family, descendants of Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain
500 years before. In 1944, they were rounded up by the thousands
and sent to concentration camps, where most of them died.
   ``We were shooting in the exact barrack where the events
happened,'' Loggia recalled. ``We were freezing in our prison
uniforms and our wooden clogs, filth and mud all about us. It was
so thoroughly recreated that you did recapitulate the actual
event.''
   ``Triumph of the Spirit'' adds another chapter to Loggia's
remarkable acting career that has ranged from dashing heroics as a
Disney leading man to status as one of the screen's busiest
character actors, with a low period in between.
   ``Like all men and women, there was a kind of middle-age crisis
in a Dante-esque sense,'' he reflected. ``Midway in the walk of
life, you descend into Hades and decide, `Oh, I'll just climb back
out of this inferno and take life rather than the pit of fire.'
   ``I went through that, sure. I think one of the residual
benefits of being an actor comes if you can hang in and continue to
grow as a person and not be a `one-trick pony.' I'll be 60 this
month, and I look forward to playing pops and grandpops and
great-grandpops. Why not keep going, as long as you don't get a
face-lift and try to look like a juvenile?
   ``I'm enjoying this part of my life, enormously. Which is, I
guess, saying I live in the present.''
   Robert Loggia was born on Staten Island in New York City to
Italian immigrants and first spoke Italian at home. He started out
to be a newsman but switched to acting under the tutelage of the
famed Alvina Krause at Northwestern University. After Army duty he
landed in New York and studied with Stella Adler. His stage work
brought Hollywood offers, and he starred for Disney in the TV
series ``The Nine Lives of Elfego Baca.'' He later starred in the
critically acclaimed adventure series ``T.H.E. Cat.''
   But his demand as a handsome leading man faded, and Loggia
retreated to New York and his ``inferno'' period from 1968 to 1974.
He credits his emergence to a couple of plays for Joseph Papp,
``Wedding Band'' with Ruby Dee and ``In the Boom-Boom Room'' with
Madeleine Kahn.
   ``I found that I still had something on the ball as an actor in
both those plays,'' he said. ``I came back to L.A. after a six-year
absence, aiming to conconstitute my career. I found it wasn't easy.
With absence, there's a certain distrust: `Is he a drinker?' `Did
he live in a tree?' `Is he strange?'''
   The only jobs he could find were guest heavies in episodic
television _ ``usually a Mafia guy in a nice suit.'' That proved a
dead end, and he tried directing, his first being a ``Magnum,
P.I.'' Then came ``An Officer and a Gentleman.'' Producers first
saw his strength as a character actor, and he followed with
``Scarface,'' ``The Jagged Edge'' (Academy nomination as supporting
actor), ``Prizzi's Honor,'' ``S.O.B.,'' ``Big'' and his current NBC
series ``Mancuso, FBI.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Cleaning Up Richard Wagner's Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The music of German composer Richard Wagner, a
self-declared anti-Semite whose operas blared over loudspeakers in
Nazi death camps, is taboo in Israel.
   But Gottfried Wagner maintains his great-grandfather's work was
exploited by the Nazis, and he is touring the Jewish state to
rectify what he calls the distorted image of the 19th century
composer.
   ``Wagner's message was exactly the opposite of what the Nazis
stood for,'' said the 42-year-old musicologist.
   He added, however, that he empathized with Jews who responded to
the music with anguish and anger. One of Wagner's greatest operatic
achievements, ``Ring des Nibelungen'' (``The Ring of the
Nibelungen''), was loved by Hitler, who considered it a
glorification of a master race. Throughout its history, the Ring's
story has been the subject of differing and often bizarre
interpretations. The music, though, is another matter.
   An epic involving love and greed and gods and goddesses and
performed in four operas _ ``Das Rheingold,'' ``Die Walkure,''
``Siegfried'' and ``Gotterdammerung'' _ the Ring is a tangled tale
about the theft of a magic ring and the disasters of all who pursue
it. The score is heavy and compelling.
   ``I understand completely if Israelis reject Wagner,'' the
composer's great-grandson said in an interview. ``Many Jews went to
their deaths in the camps while having to listen to his music.''
   His campaign, including media interviews and a university
lecture series, has renewed debate on whether to rescind the
unofficial boycott that has kept Wagner's operas off Israel's
airwaves.
   In the past, all efforts to break the boycott have been met with
stormy protest, although many Israelis say they listen to Wagner at
home.
   When after a 1981 Israel Philharmonic Orchestra concert,
conductor Zubin Mehta announced as an encore the prelude to the
Wagner opera ``Tristan and Isolde,'' the audience cried, ``Shame!''
An usher rushed to the stage, pulled up his shirt to show
Nazi-inflicted scars and shouted, ``Play Wagner on my body.''
   Avi Shoshani, the orchestra's general secretary, said he
regretted Wagner's music was still off-limits. ``It's a big loss.
Our orchestra would have played it magnificently. It's a whole
important segment in the history of music we are not touching,'' he
said.
   But Menahem Fogel, a spokesman for the Yad Vashem Holocaust
Memorial in Jerusalem, said Wagner should not be played as long as
Holocaust survivors are alive. ``One has to consider the
sensitivities of the people who lived through that period,'' he
said.
   Shai Burstyn, head of the musicology department at Tel Aviv
University, said Richard Wagner held anti-Semitic views, although
they should be seen in the context of the times.
   ``I'm separating between the man and his music,'' said Burstyn,
whose department sponsored the lecture series. ``There was hardly a
19th century composer who was not an anti-Semite.''
   In an 1850 pamphlet, titled ``The Jew in Music,'' Richard Wagner
railed against what he considered the undue influence of Jews in
Germany's music circles.
   ``The pamphlet is shameful, but you can't draw a straight line
from this to Auschwitz,'' Gottfried Wagner said. He said his
great-grandfather was an ambitious man, who lashed out because he
felt the music establishment was withholding recognition of his
achievements.
   Despite the prejudice expressed in the pamphlet, the central
message of his work, especially of the operatic cycle ``The Ring of
the Nibelung,'' is one of hope, Wagner said.
   ``He felt that men have to choose between love and destruction.
He hoped that future generations would learn from the mistakes of
the past and opt for love, not destruction,'' Wagner said.
   This message was perverted when Hitler, a Wagner enthusiast,
came to power 50 years after the composer's death, Wagner said.
   Hitler befriended Winifred Wagner, Gottfried's grandmother and a
driving force at the Bayreuth Festival of Wagnerian music during
the Third Reich. The Nazi dictator and the Wagner clan subsequently
turned the composer's operatic protagonists, anti-heroes who always
met tragic ends, into ``blond Aryan monsters,'' he said.
   Wagner said he distanced himself from the family early on. He
conducted research on German Jewish culture and wrote a doctoral
dissertation on German-Jewish composer Kurt Weill. He lives in
Cerro Maggiore, Italy, and also works as a stage and TV director.
He came to Israel to begin a dialogue about his great-grandfather.
   Howevever, a matter-of-fact discussion about the composer might
only be possible in another 20 years, he said. In the meantime, he
is not pushing too hard for an end of the Wagner ban.
   ``This is up to the Israelis, especially the victims of the
Holocaust,'' Wagner said.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Shawn Colvin Goes `Steady On'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Suzanne Vega's debut album came out in
1985, her friend Shawn Colvin didn't want to hear it. Jealousy,
admittedly, was the reason.
   ``I respect her very much but at the time I was threatened and I
didn't listen to her very closely,'' recalled the 31-year-old
Colvin, a onetime backup singer for Vega who now has a record of
her own, ``Steady On.''
   ``When she made her first record I really kept a distance. I was
afraid. In a way I'll always be envious that she kind of broke this
ground. She was really a surprise, a woman singer-songwriter and
she was very poetic.''
   Colvin may have felt a twinge from any record. She started
performing at age 18 but took years to develop the confidence
needed for making her debut album. Mental blocks and roadblocks got
in the way.
   She tried writing as a teen-ager but quickly discarded the
material because she considered it immature. Then came years of
touring. Bands and cities became a blur for the Vermillion, S.D.,
native. All songwriters pay dues, but Colvin seemed afraid of
reaping the benefits.
   ``I felt very connected to the records that I had and the people
I aspired to emulate but the reality was completely terrifying to
me,'' said Colvin, whose early heroes included Joni Mitchell and
Laura Nyro.
   ``As a result, I joined different people's bands and moved in
different towns and never had the courage to keep progressing on my
own. It got too real and I'd lose my confidence.''
   The turning point, she said, came in 1983 in New York. She quit
drinking, decided to perform solo and made several new friends,
including Vega, with whom she toured Europe in fall 1987. Upon
returning, Colvin thought hard about what she wanted to do.
   ``I had just come out night after night on stages in front of
thousands of people and had a great time. I was part of this wildly
successful thing, but I got home and I was nobody, relatively
speaking.
   ``I would just sit up at night and smoke cigarettes and stare
out into space. I was really depressed but it was a really great
time.''
   So after trips and stumbles, Colvin went to work. She toured
folk clubs around the East Coast and in 1988 won the New York Music
Award as best new vocalist. She was signed by Columbia Records the
same year.
   ``Steady On'' was co-produced by Steve Addabbo and John
Leventhal, who shares writing credits on six of the record's 10
songs. Colvin plays acoustic guitar on each cut and the
arrangements are a mix of folk, rock and country.
   She notes that Vega, who contributes backing vocals, is a little
jealous, too, insisting that Colvin is the ``tougher'' artist.
She's certainly trying. The title track of ``Steady On'' is a
message to herself, a string tied around her finger. ``I am gonna
keep my head on straight,'' Colvin vows, singing over an
appropriately steady track laid down by Leventhal.
   In ``The Story,'' she insists that ``I'll always be telling this
story,'' a powerful statement of purpose for a songwriter, almost a
declaration of principles.
   ``Diamond in the Rough,'' with its warning that ``there's
nothing so cruel as to bury that jewel,'' is her unofficial theme
song, a promise to never stay quiet.
   ``When I was a kid it seemed that everywhere I turned around
there was a lot of games being played _ at home, in church, at
school,'' she said, her voice cracking slightly, taking on a
hurtful tone.
   ``I just felt people were pretending. I felt there was a lot of
phoniness around me, and it really bugged me. I just felt oppressed
by phoniness and I just wanted truth. I had to find a way of
expressing it and keep it hidden at the same time. A lot of these
songs are saying it doesn't have to be hidden anymore.''
   ``Bless the meek. Heal the sick. Protect the weak,'' Colvin
sings on the ballad ``Dead of the Night.'' They were just words at
first, random thoughts scribbled on paper as mindlessly as signing
for a registered letter. Thinking about it later, Colvin saw them
as wishes, reasons for spending hours alone in a dimly lighted room.
   ``You see the bigger picture. You're not in a room worrying
about picking up your laundry. You have this great feeling for
energy or healing or desire for the world,'' she said.
   ``Certainly if I didn't think I was doing something in
songwriting besides just putting down my little petty feelings I'm
sure I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't have put a song like `The Story'
on a record if I didn't think I was writing for a lot of other
people.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Selective Listening</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tell John Edgar Wideman a story and he might
forget it moments later. It's nothing personal, though. The author
isn't a bad listener, just a selective one. Accents and inflections
sometimes interest him more than the words themselves.
   But even if he doesn't always remember a good story, Wideman
never fails to appreciate a story well told. That means sentence
rhythms, the tone of voice, evoking an entire world by a simple
turn of phrase.
   Inspiration has come from professionals and amateurs alike.
Authors James Baldwin and Zora Neale Hurston must share credit with
members of Wideman's family, such as his three aunts to whom
``Fever'' ($16.95, Henry Holt), a collection of 12 short stories,
is dedicated.
   ``I believe that people develop very unusual capacities,'' said
Wideman, author of ``Brothers and Keepers'' and ``Sent for You
Yesterday,'' in a recent interview.
   ``It's often when one is stunted or lost, or sometimes just
because a person has a predeliction to that sense or ability. I
believe that very much. I think it's very important thematically in
my work and intellectually overall. Being an Afro-American, I had
to be quite aware of a level of meaning below the words being
spoken.''
   So Wideman isn't kidding when he talks of bringing the bad news,
filling in grim details of stories he may have missed the first
time around. In the title story of ``Fever,'' he writes of a plague
that swept Philadelphia in the late 1700s and how blacks were
blamed for the widespread illness.
   ``That story's all about the fabled outside agitators, who we
always go after. In the '20s, the Communists came from outside;
anarchists were crazy Europeans from outside.
   ``AIDS came from outside. Everything comes form outside. You
talk about Civil Rights, it's the people in the North. That's the
real problem, I think.''
   Wideman, 49, emerged from the Pittsburgh ghetto of Homewood, the
setting for his trilogy: ``Damballah,'' ``Hiding Place'' and ``Sent
for You Yesterday,'' winner of the PEN-Faulkner Award in 1984. He
attended the University of Pennsylvania, and his first novel, ``A
Glance Away,'' was published in 1967.
   His books read like old, scratchy 78s. Words seem to hiss and
pop. The language is deliberately crude, separate and unequal, but
by no means inferior to ``official'' prose. Wideman has learned
from his grandfather, another non-writer, about the way with words.
   ``I didn't like to go to stores with my grandfather because he
spoke in a Southern, rural, halting way. I didn't know that he just
used that accent at times. I wasn't aware of the kind subtlety.
   ``When he'd go pick up a pair of shoes and ask the man how much
they cost, he knew how much the damned things cost, he could read
the prices. He couldn't take it for granted that $7.95 shoes were
$7.95. It would just embarrass me and I'd want to go somewhere
else, but the old man was working his mojo on the shoe clerk.''
   Wideman pays full attention to voices, letting his characters
dictate their own oral histories. In ``Doc's Story,'' a man's
girlfriend walks out on him and he copes by spending hours at the
local basketball court, shooting hoops and swapping stories.
   He's obsessed by the story of Doc, a former teacher and local
legend on the court. It seems that Doc went blind over the years,
but his touch for making foulshots remained undiminished. To the
narrator, there's magic in Doc's story, and perhaps in his own as
well.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``If he had known Doc's story he would have said: `There's still
a chance. There's always a chance. I mean this guy, Doc. Christ. He
was stone blind. But he got out on the court and played. Over
there. Right over there. On that very court across the hollow from
us. It happened. I've talked to people about it many times. If Doc
could do that, than anything's possible. We're possible ...'
   ```If a blind man could play basketball, surely we ...' If he
had known Doc's story, would it have saved them? He hears himself
saying the words. The ball arches from Doc's fingertips, the
miracle of it sinking. Would she have believed any of it?''

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Wideman himself has less faith, once describing himself as a
pessimist who doubts that ``things have gotten better.'' Bad news
helped make him that way. In 1975, his brother, Robert, was
involved in a robbery during which a man was murdered. Robert now
serves a life sentence in jail, an ordeal described in detail in
``Brothers and Keepers.''
   Three years ago, Wideman's son, Jake, stabbed a friend to death,
and the victim's parents have sued the author for damages. Wideman
declines to discuss the case, but when he talks of ``Doc's Story''
and the acceptance of loss, there is the realization that he's
haunted by voices he'd prefer not to hear.
   ``You know the person's gone, but there's some level which you
hold on,'' he said. ``It's hope. It would take a miracle to get her
back and he knows it. The question all the stories raise is, `Are
miracles possible?' Well, probably not and it's probably silly to
hope they are, but who knows?
   ``Part of the miracle to me is human hope and faith in face of
the reality that things usually don't work out. Ninety-nine times
out of a hundred they don't work out. They never work out in the
sense that you get old and you die.''

   Campeau Corp. won a five-day reprieve from a
group of banks that could force the retailing giant to file for
bankruptcy protection by declaring it in default on a $2.34 billion
loan.
   The banks agreed Sunday to extend a grace period for Campeau
before deciding whether it is in default on the loan, a banking
industry source said.
   The extension until Friday gives Campeau breathing room to come
up with a plan to avoid a bankruptcy filing for its retailing

   General Motors Corp. said it had reached a
tentative agreement with a Hungarian government-owned automaker to
invest $150 million in a plant under construction in the Eastern
European nation.
   The deal, announced Sunday, would make GM the first U.S.
automaker to invest in Eastern Europe, which has undergone
tremendous political and economic liberalization in recent months,
said R.L. Theis, GM's Detroit-based international spokesman.
   The agreement between General Motors Europe and RABA, Hungary's
state-owned manufacturer of trucks, diesel engines and axles,
involves a joint venture to build engines and cars at a plant in
Szentgotthard, near the Austrian border, beginning in 1992.

   Soaring energy costs pushed wholesale prices
up 0.7 percent in December, bringing inflation in 1989 to an
eight-year high of 4.8 percent, the government said.
   The sharp, seasonally adjusted monthly rise helped spook
financial markets, which read it as a sign the Federal Reserve
would not lower interest rates anytime soon.

   The European Community's unemployment rate
fell to a seven-year low of 8.9 percent during November, EC's
statistics agency Eurostat announced Monday.
   The decline in November _ from 9 percent in October and 9.7
percent in November 1988 _ put the jobless rate below 9 percent for
the first time since 1982.
   Henning Christophersen, the EC's Economic Affairs Commissioner,
said the drop showed the ``investment and growth-oriented
policies'' of the 12-nation trade bloc were working.
   Eurostat said that national unemployment rates either fell
slightly or were unchanged in November except in West Germany and
Denmark. The rise in West Germany reflected the movement of East
German workers to the West seeking jobs, the statement said.

   Prices opened lower on Wall Street today,

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 8.32 to 2,680.89 as

   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about 3

   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.97 million shares after the

   Analysts said the selling that began Friday after two
disappointing economic reports continued into today's session.
   ``There's no reason for it to go up,'' said Larry Wachtel, an

   The government reported Friday that wholesale prices surged 0.7
percent during December while retail sales rose a sluggish 0.2

   Union Carbide Corp. said today that a $470
million settlement for victims of the 1984 gas-leak disaster in
Bhopal, India, remains binding even though the country's new
government has disavowed the settlement.
   ``We are confident the settlement will stand. There is simply no
basis for overturning it,'' Joseph E. Geoghan, Union Carbide vice
president and general counsel, said in a statement.
   Last week, the new government of Prime Minister V.P. Singh said
its predecessor was wrong to agree to absolve Union Carbide of
criminal liability in the gas disaster. It also called the
settlement inadequate.
   Justice Minister Dinesh Goswami said the new government would
support the gas victims and activists in Supreme Court petitions
challenging the right of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's
government to settle the case.
   But Geoghan called the settlement ``extremely fair'' and said it
is a binding agreement.
   ``The new administration may not disavow the settlement because
it disagrees with it,'' he said.
   At least 3,598 people were killed and another 20,000 injured
when methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a Union Carbide pesticide
plant plant on Dec. 3, 1984.

<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp.'s decision to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection from creditors for its two U.S. retailing subsidiaries
today means the debt-swamped businesses can operate, and many
consumers may never notice a change.
   None of the 260 stores operated by Federated Department Stores
Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. is expected to close although some may
be sold as part of any future restructuring, which will have to be
approved by a bankruptcy judge. Under Chapter 11 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Act, companies are shielded from creditors while they
remain in business and attempt to reorganize their finances so all
debts eventually can be repaid. Many companies emerge from Chapter
11 as smaller but financially sound businesses.
   In Campeau's case, the Chapter 11 filing's immediate result
would be to keep stores open and supplied. Many businesses had been
reluctant to continue shipping merchandise to Campeau stores
because they weren't sure they'd be paid, but the filing will
establish a timetable for payment that should help reassure these
suppliers.
   It is unclear how the filing may affect Campeau's 110,000
employees in the United States, some of whom presumably could be
laid off in any bankruptcy restructuring.
   Uncertainty over whether Campeau would be able to repay the $8
billion in debts it has acquired through takeovers of Federated and
Allied in the 1980s was the main reason the parent company sought
bankruptcy court refuge for its U.S. units.

   National Westminster Bank PLC, one of Britain's
largest commercial banks, on Monday named a new deputy chairman as
part of a series of changes that include reducing the size of its
board to 19 members from 28.
   The new deputy chairman will be Christopher Tugendhat, currently
a board member who is chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority and
a former vice president of the European Community Commission. He
will replace Philip Wilkinson ,who is to retire June 30.
   Anthony Touche, Leslie Young and Lord Boyne also will retire.
The retirements had been expected.
   Natwest said the board's decision to reduce its number will take
effect from the annual general meeting April 24.
   ``A board with fewer members will be able to address issues in
depth so as to determine our corporate objective and policy,'' said
Chairman Lord Alexander.
   The former chairman, Lord Boardman, stepped down last year.
   Boardman had planned to retire at the end of 1989. Instead, he
resigned in September after Natwest and its investment banking arm
were strongly criticized by the Department of Trade and Industry
for their role in the 1987 sale of Blue Arrow PLC shares to finance
that company's takeover of Manpower Inc., the U.S.-based employment
services company.
   The brokers involved failed to disclose the amount of stock they
continued to hold after the shares failed to sell.
   Natwest said it was also creating a new British advisory unit to
help shape the bank's British strategy. Sir Hugh Cubitt, David
Money-Coutts, Barry Reed and Alan McLintock are directors who will
leave the main board to form the nucleus of the new unit.

   Consumer prices rose 20.7 percent in Israel
during 1989 despite an austerity program aimed at reducing
inflation, the government said Monday.
   Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics said prices rose 1.1
percent in December, compared with 1.3 percent in November and 1.6
percent in December 1988.
   The December increase in the Consumer Price Index, which
measures price changes in a fixed market basket of goods, brought
the total for the year to 20.7 percent. This compared with 16.4
percent in 1988 and 16.1 percent in 1987.
   The price performance was still far better than the 1984 peak
when inflation reached 445 percent.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres had pledged to bring the nation's
inflation rate down to ``one-digit figures'' in 1989 when he
announced a major austerity program at the start of the year. That
program included two devaluations of the shekel against the dollar
and cuts in subsidies for consumer goods.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower,
then turned mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   The soybean market was struggling to advance but was held back
by reports of weekend rain in a key soybean-producing area of
southern Brazil.
   ``The market's trying to come back here'' after last Friday's
fairly steep decline, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``I think we overdid it somewhat
on Friday.''
   The Soviet Union was said to be bidding for 525,000 metric tons
of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, a supportive factor in the
wheat market that was offset by forecasts for rain this week in
U.S. winter wheat country.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.99} a bushel; corn
futures were { cent to 1 cent higher with March at $2.43 a bushel;
oats were unchanged to } cent higher with March at $1.43\ a bushel;
soybeans were 2{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with January at

   Livestock futures were lower while pork bellies were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .20 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
February at 77 cents a pound; feeder cattle futures were .15 cent

   Prices declined broadly on Wall Street today,
extending the sharp losses the stock market suffered on Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 12.38 to

<HEAD>Britain's Communist Tabloid Launches Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Morning Star, Britain's Communist daily
newspaper, published a front-page appeal to its readers Monday for
$240,000 to buy new equipment.
   The appeal was ``the only solution to the enormous crisis faced
by the paper as the result of the drastic halving of the copies
previously ordered by the Soviet Union,'' the newspaper said.
   The Morning Star's Soviet distributor cut in half its daily
order of 12,000 copies on Dec. 25 after the Kremlin ordered it to
meet efficiency guidelines.
   The tabloid, which marked its 60th anniversary this month, will
lose an estimated $660,000 of its annual income of $2.8 million
because of the Soviet cut.
   Up to 25 jobs will be cut and the newspaper will be reduced to
eight pages from 12 until it can buy better printing equipment, it
said.
   ``A clarion call is going out to all the democratic and
progressive forces which the paper has served so long and so
faithfully, urging them to come to its aid,'' the paper said.
   It said the appeal has raised $3,200, half from an employee who
had planned to bequeath the money in her will, and the other half
from a lifelong reader.
   The newspaper's circulation, now at 23,500, peaked in 1947 at
143,000.

<TEXT>
   These are times that challenge the determination
and creativity of American car companies, not just over the
short-term, which is known to be a tough testing ground, but in the
long run too.
   General Motors' profit on each car made in North America over
the past decade has averaged $50, which is nothing to write about
in the annual report, but still it has lost market share. How do
you work out of that dilemma?
   Ford and Chrysler, and GM as well, developed big interests in
the defense industry during the 1980s, not knowing that the
economic and geopolitical map of the world would be scattered like
a jigsaw puzzle, undermining spending.
   Now all the car companies, foreign and domestic, are facing a
Congress that seems determined to raise the gasoline mileage
performance of their products, the better, it is claimed, to
consersve fuel and keep the air clean.
   The market, meanwhile, has become anemic. Instead of announcing
record-high sales, as they had become accustomed to, the car
companies now are announcing sales declines and production cutbacks.
   In the 1989 final quarter, domestic-make sales dropped to a 6.2
million annual rate, the lowest quarterly figure in nearly seven
years. And January production estimates are only 4.5 million units,
2 million below earlier plans.
   Over the longer term, the picture might improve _ but probably
not by a great degree, according to a 10-year outlook from the
University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.
   The market through 2000 is likely to be a mature one, it says,
with more offerings competing for a relatively fixed set of
customers. How did the institute reach that conclusion? By
interviewing 250 industry executives.
   As a result of those interviews, it concludes that manufacturers
will be forced to reduce costs, improve quality and offer better
services to buyers, an assignment that might chill the most
confident executive.
   It will mean, says the study, that manufacturers might have to
extend power train warranties up to 10 years or 100,000 miles on
some models, and that the average total life of cars will climb to
12 years by 2000 from 11 in 1990.
   At the same time, prices will be held down. They might climb in
the next year or so, the institute believes, but then level off so
that a U.S.-made car costing $14,000 in 1990 would sell for $15,900
in 2000.
   Of course, all car companies will be expected simultaneously to
continue with the same old assignment of improving sales month by
month and year by year, even if the market as a whole doesn't
accommodate those goals.
   The study estimated that passenger car sales in the United
States will grow less than 1 percent a year over the decade, to
10.9 million units in 2000 from 10.1 million in 1990. Light truck
sales also will grow slowly, but less so.
   Unless the Big Three surprise the institute _ and, apparently,
themselves too _ their best efforts still will mean a loss of
market share over the decade, to 61 percent of passenger car sales
in 2000 from 64 percent in 1990.
   The estimates have unusual validity in the car market, because
the data on which they are made come, so to speak, from the horse's
mouth. i.e., from automotive executives, engineers, suppliers,
consultants and academics.
   The particular study that developed these figures is the fifth
in a series of 10-year forecasts directed by David E. Cole,
professor of mechanical engineering and director of the institute's
Study of Automotive Transportation.
   The message it flashes couldn't be more clear: Carmakers who
thought they had done everything possible to produce high quality
cars at the lowest price will have to exert even greater effort.
   The buyer is in the driver's seat.

   Stock prices finished lower Monday on the London
Stock Exchange, although well above the day's lows.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 13.9
points, or 0.59 percent, to 2,366.2. Its midmorning low had been
2,352.8, and it closed near it high for the day.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was off 12.2 points
at 1,896.9, and the Financial Times 500-share index closed at
1,292.92, down 8.47.
   Volume amounted to 359.6 million shares, compared with the 523.9
million shares on Friday.
   The market opened sharply lower following downturns in the U.S.
and Japanese equity markets last week. But prices recovered later
on what analysts said was bargain-hunting.
   A midday report that British retail sales rose more than
expected in December limited the recovery in prices, however, by
adding to fears that the government's anti-inflation strategy will
fall apart without another increase in interest rates.

   Prices moved broadly lower on Wall Street today
as traders shied away from the stock market after its sharp losses
on Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 12.16 to
2,677.05 as of 2 p.m. EST.
   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about 5
to 2, with 405 stocks rising, 1,064 falling and 437 unchanged on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to a moderate 104.04 million shares
at midafternoon.
 the selling that began Friday after two
disappointing economic reports continued into today's session.
   ``They don't see any reason to take an aggressive stand on the
buy  Analysts said  side,'' said Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer
&amp; Co.
   The government reported Friday that wholesale prices surged 0.7
percent during December while retail sales rose a sluggish 0.2
percent. The combination of accelerating inflation and a softening
economy unnerved many investors and stock prices fell sharply, with
the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling more than 71 points.
   Trading was relatively light today as many institutional buyers
took the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday off.
   Financial markets in Japan were closed for a holiday, and many
U.S. traders were waiting to see how stocks would fare when Tokyo
trading resumed Tuesday. The Japanese stock market had its worst
decline in two years on likely to be
similar to last week,'' Ishikawa said. ``The yen will remain weak,
and the plunge in government bond prices will not stop any time
soon.''
   Former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe and seven other lawmakers
from the governing Liberal Democratic Party are in Moscow. Abe met
Monday with Gorbachev.
   Another worry is inflation. The weaker yen, which makes imports
of raw materials and fuel more expensive, has increased
inflationary pressures, prompting the Bank of Japan to boost
interest rates to curb price rises and support the yen.
   ``It is too optimistic to see the current plunge as a
transitional, adjustment process,'' said Josen Takahashi, chief
economist with Mitsubishi Research Institute.
   ``There's nothing positive in the securities market because of
the current inflationary pressures,'' he told the newspaper Asahi
Shimbun.
   Takahashi said inflationary pressure in Japan has created a
``triple low'' phenomenon _ a simultaneous decline in securities,
yen and government bond prices.
   Despite market expectations that the Bank of Japan will continue
supporting the yen, possibly by boosting the official discount
rate, traders said they expect the Japanese currency to stay weak
because of political uncertainty over national elections expected
in February.
   Their major concern is whether the pro-business Liberal
Democrats will maintain their majority in Parliament's lower house.
The party lost its control in the less-powerful upper house last
year after a series of money and sex scandals involving party
lawmakers and the introduction of an unpopular 3 percent sales tax.
   The central bank also is expected to maintain its high interest
rate policy in order to control inflationary pressures resulting
from the weaker yen, traders said.

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ A U.S. venture that was designed to regain
control of the vital computer chip industry from Japanese dominance
is being folded because it failed to attract investors, officials
announced today.
   U.S. Memories Inc. was hailed as a $1 billion cooperative
venture by American companies, but in its seven brief months of
life, it failed to make a single computer chip or earn a single
dollar.
   ``I am extremely disappointed by these turn of events,'' said
Sanford L. Kane, president of U.S. Memories, at a news conference
at Santa Clara headquarters. ``What happens today does not bode
well for an industry that has made a technical decision rather than
a tactical one.''
   Kane told reporters that the joint venture will be terminated,
largely because of a lack of support from the electronics industry.
   The venture had not found a new investor since its formation
last June by seven big-name backers _ International Business
Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel
Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., National Semiconductor Corp.
and LSI Logic, according to a Saturday report by the San Francisco
Chronicle.
   The New York Times and The Washington Post had quoted
unidentified industry sources indicating the venture would announce
its demise today.
   The consortium was planned to challenge Japanese leadership in
the making of computer memory chips called DRAMs, or dynamic random
access memories, often compared to crude oil in their importance to
industry.
   Despite today's announcement, Kane said the venture had produced
some positive results.
   ``We did achieve some significant things in the process,'' Kane
said. ``We showed that with some creativity and support and
teamwork we could come up with a solution within the American
framework. We clearly increased the impact of the seimconductor
industry and DRAMs in particular.''
   Spokesmen for Intel and Advanced Micro Devices had told the San
Francisco Chronicle they still supported the plan.
   Observers cited by the Chronicle said the consortium may simply
stop actively seeking investors or announce a restructuring plan.
But they said these developments are unlikely.
   ``It looks like the end,'' said T.J. Rodgers, chief executive of
San Jose-based Cypress Semiconductor, a critic of the consortium
plan.
   The failure would be regarded as a major setback for advocates
of collective action to improve U.S. competitiveness.
   ``It's a true strategic setback,'' said Ralph Thomson, chief
executive of International Business Catalysts, a Palo Alto
consulting firm that focuses on trade and technology.
   U.S. Memories in June announced its plan for construction of a
$1 billion plant to make the 4-megabit DRAM chips. The plant was to
be paid for by $500 million in equity financing from chip makers
and users and $500 million in debt, with fund raising expected to
be completed last year.
   By November, several major computer companies _ including Sun
Microsystems Inc., Unisys Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Tandy
Corp. _ said they would not join as investors.
   Computer industry officials told the Times that the end of U.S.
Memories was decided Wednesday at a meeting in Dallas attended by
the seven founding companies and others considering joining the
venture.
   The Times said the project failed in part because the memory
chips have become more widely available as Samsung of South Korea,
Siemens A.G. of West Germany and Motorola Inc. of the United States
have begun manufacturing the chips. There had been a shortage of
the chips in 1988.
   By the mid-1980s, all but two of the U.S. companies that
pioneered the DRAM industry had left the field in the face of
competition from the Japanese, who now supply the majority of
memory chips.

   For the first time since Prohibition, a
division of Adolph Coors Co. is selling a non-alcoholic beverage, a
new product called Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water, company
officials said Monday.
   The product goes on sale this week in Colorado, Arizona and
Northern California cities mainly in the San Francisco area, Coors
spokesman Heidi Buehler Nogues said.
   ``Bottled water is the fastest-growing beverage category in
America,'' John Recca, brand development manager, said in a news
release. ``The timing is right for us to take advantage of our
legendary water source.''
   The product is made by Coors Brewing Co., which is a business
unit of the Golden-based Adolph Coors Co.
   Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water will be packaged in
6.5-ounce, six-pack bottles and in 28-ounce bottes, officials said.
It will be available in original, lemon lime and cherry flavors.
   In the past five years, the bottled water marketplace has grown
about 10 percent, primarily because of the consumer interest in
health and fitness, Coors said.
   A key to Coors' product is the use of pure, Rocky Mountain
spring water, an ingredient that has made the company's beers
famous for 50 years, Coors said.
   ``The new product also provides the company with a good
opportunity to diversify its beverage line and provide consumers
with new choices,'' Coors officials said. ``This is especially
important with the growing national trend toward moderate alcohol
consumption.''
   During the 1920s, the manufacture, sale and transportation of
alcoholic beverages was banned in the United States. Buehler Nogues
said Coors sold malt beverages which did not contain alcohol. The
law was repealed in 1933.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki on
Monday urged Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan to increase
investments and economic involvement to help Poland's reform
efforts.
   Mazowiecki also thanked Kaifu for his government's decision to
contribute $150 million in credit to a stabilization fund to back
the zloty as the part of the transition to a convertible Polish
currency, but said more could be done.
   ``I positively assess the state of political relations between
our countries. However, economic cooperation does not catch up with
them. We want Japan to occupy a considerably higher position both
on the list of trading partners and as regards economic involvement
in Poland,'' Mazowiecki said at a lunch for Kaifu.
   ``We want this to this to be coupled with the transfer of
patterns of Japanese organization of production and high quality of
labor, recognized worldwide, to the Polish economy,'' the PAP news
agency quoted Mazowiecki as saying.
   Kaifu is the first major leader from Asia to visit Poland since
Mazowiecki was elected to lead Poland's first non-communist
government in over four decades on Aug. 24.
   The United States and West Germany have led the developed
countries in pledging aid to help the troubled Polish economy and
assist radical economic reform efforts.
   In addition to its pledge to the currency stabilization fund,
Japan has agreed to provide Poland with $25 million worth of food
aid and $15 million to help train Polish managers.
   Japan is considering a possible $350 million guarantee for
government investments as well as a $500 million guarantee by the
Japanese EXIM Bank for Japanese investments in Poland.
   The conditions of the guarantees have yet to be worked out.
   Poland is also hoping for Japanese support during negotiations
by the Paris club on Poland's $40 billion foreign debt.
   Poland would like a three-year relief on interest payments on
the debt so that precious hard currency can be used for investment
purposes and to stabilize the currency.
   Kaifu assured President Wojciech Jaruzelski of further economic
support for Poland as economic experts discussed terms of future
Japanese credit guarantees during an earlier meeting.
   Kaifu also met with Sejm speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewciz and Senate
speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski on the final day of a two-day visit
to Poland, the PAP news agency reported.
   PAP said that Kaifu told Jaruzelski that Japan would increase
its support for the changes underway in Poland, particularly in the
field of financial cooperation.
   After his meetings in Poland, Kaifu traveled to Budapest on the
last leg of a seven-country, 10-day tour of Europe.
   Kaifu was met at the airport by his Hungarian counterpart Miklos
Nemeth, the state Hungarian news agency MTI said.

   Corn futures prices rose modestly in broad-based
buying Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade while wheat and soybean
futures retreated slightly.
   Corn's advance apparently was related to last week's Agriculture
Department crop report, which pegged both the 1989 U.S. corn
harvest and the nation's corn stockpile at levels that were lower
than the market had expected.
   ``It looks like some users got caught short,'' said Dale
Gustafson, an analyst in Chicago with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Soybean futures were pressed by reports of weekend rainfall in
southern Brazil, a major soybean-producing area.
   Forecasts for rain later this week in winter wheat areas of the
United States weighed on the wheat futures market.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.99 a bushel; corn futures
were unchanged to 1} cents higher with March at $2.44 a bushel;
oats were unchanged to } cent higher with March at $1.43{ a bushel;

<HEAD>Campeau's U.S. Grocery Chain Avoids Bankruptcy Filing</HEAD>

   Ralphs Grocery Co. has avoided the
financial woes gnawing at Campeau Corp.'s other U.S. companies,
Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., Ralphs'
chief said Monday.
   ``It's business as usual,'' Chairman and Chief Executive Byron
Allumbaugh said after Allied and Federated sought protection from
their creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law.
   ``Nothing has occurred that will in any way change or alter the
way Ralphs does business,'' Allumbaugh said.
   Ralphs, with 142 stores, is the third largest supermarket chain
in Southern California.
   Toronto-based Campeau, the huge retailer burdened with billions
of dollars of debts, acquired Ralphs as part of its 1988 takeover
of Federated.
   But Ralphs became an independent corporation under the Campeau
umbrella in July 1988, and is unaffected by the bankruptcy filings.
   ``We are a separate corporation from Federated, with our own
debt, our own bank financing,'' Allumbaugh said. ``Ralphs needs no
funds from Campeau and the Campeau Corp. is prohibited from
removing any funds from Ralphs.''
   Most Ralphs customers are unaware the company is part of
Campeau, and Ralphs has no immediate plan to advertise to reassure
them, he said.
   As part of the spinoff from Federated, Ralphs management bought
a stake in Ralphs by paying Federated $1.02 billion, which the
managers borrowed. The cost of paying down that debt has kept
Ralphs in the red, a circumstance expected as part of the deal.
   But analysts say the grocery chain has had no problems paying
interest on the nearly $1 billion debt that remains while
remodeling and adding stores as needed.
   For example, Ralphs had $40 million on hand to pay the $11.3
million in debt due at the end of this month, said Andrew Leinoff,
an analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei in Montpelier, Vt.
   When rumors of the impending Allied and Federated filings began
circulating last week, Allumbaugh and Ralphs bankers and financial
strategists met with suppliers to reassure them of the grocery
chain's solvency.
   Allumbaugh told the suppliers that Ralphs has been able to cut
its net losses from $72.6 million in fiscal 1988 to about $31
million in fiscal 1989, which ends Jan. 28.
   The company projects a net loss of $7 million in the coming
year, followed by a $17 million profit in fiscal 1991, he said.
   ``For the year ending this month, we had an operating cash flow
of $189 million, and the cash interest on our debt is about $130
million. So we have about $59 million of free cash flow to reinvest
in our business,'' Allumbaugh said.
   For Ralphs customers, the Allied and Federated bankruptcy
filings are a ``non-event,'' Allumbaugh said.

   Prices fell broadly on Wall Street today as
traders, stung by Friday's sharp losses, shied away from the stock
market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 13.44 to
2,675.77 as of 3 p.m. EST.
   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of 11 to 4,
with 402 stocks rising, 1,095 falling and 432 unchanged on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to a moderate 118.89 million shares
with one hour of trading left.
   Analysts said the selling that began after two disappointing
economic reports on Friday continued into today's session.
   ``They don't see any reason to take an aggressive stand on the
buy side,'' said Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   The government reported Friday that wholesale prices surged 0.7
percent during December while retail sales rose a sluggish 0.2
percent. The combination of accelerating inflation and a softening
economy unnerved many investors and stock prices fell sharply, with
the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling more than 71 points.
   Trading was relatively light today as many institutional buyers
took the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday off.
   Financial markets in Japan were closed for a holiday, and many
U.S. traders were waiting to see how stocks would fare when Tokyo
trading resumed Tuesday. The Japanese stock market had its worst
decline in two years Friday, contributing to Wall Street's dismal
performance.
   The most active issue on the NYSE today was Philip Morris, which
fell &rsqb; to 38&rsqb;.
   Rorer Group shot up 13&lsqb; to 62&rsqb; after announcing it was
negotiating with another company on a possible merger.
   Among blue chip issues, AT&amp;T was down { to 42}, IBM was
unchanged at 97~, and General Electric fell { to 62|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.32 to 187.00. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index slipped 3.68 to 368.55.

<HEAD>Chase, First Chicago Report Lower 4th-Qtr Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Chase Manhattan Corp. said Monday that its profit fell 36
percent in the final quarter of 1989 compared with the previous
year, while another large banking company, First Chicago Corp.,
reported an 11 percent drop in quarterly net income.
   Results for all of last year also were depressed from 1988
levels, reflecting in part moves to reduce exposure to shaky Third
World debt.
   Chase said it earned $175 million, or $1.47 per share, in the
three months ended Dec. 31. That compared with earnings of $275
million, or $2.93 a share, in the 1988 period.
   Chase attributed the fourth quarter decline mainly to the fact
that it received $217 million in interest payments from Brazil in
1988, and nothing in the latest quarter. During the latest period,
Chase used less income tax benefits than the previous year, $25
million vs. $60 million.
   The fourth-quarter results also include increases in consumer
and investment banking fees and trading account income.
   For the year, the New York-based bank lost $665 million, or
$7.94 a share, after earning $1.06 billion, or $11.55 a share, in
1988.
   Chase's annual loss reflects a decision made in the third
quarter of last year to take an after-tax charge of $1.26 billion
to carry out a recapitalization plan that included a $1.15 billion
addition to its loan-loss reserves for Third World debt.
   Its total provision for possible credit losses was $1.74 billion
for all of 1989, up sharply from $750 million for 1988.
   In the fourth quarter, Chase's loan-loss provision totaled $130
million, down from $300 million in 1988.
   First Chicago netted $122.9 million in the fourth quarter, or
$1.77 a share, down from $137.3 million, or $2.07 per share, in the
previous year.
   But the company said its operating income was up 4 percent over
a year ago, $115 million vs. $110.4 million in 1988.
   The Chicago bank's income for 1989 totaled $358.7 million, or
$5.10 a share, compared with earnings of $513.1 million, or $8.20 a
share, in 1988. Full-year operating income, however, was up 8
percent to $451.2 million, or $6.56 per share, from $417.3 million,
or $6.57 a share.
   First Chicago said its allowance for credit losses was $1.28
billion at the end of the year, compared with $1.4 billion at the
end of the third quarter and $1.31 billion at the end of 1988.
   Its provision for credit losses rose to $75 million in the
fourth quarter from $50 million. Total net charge-offs were $199
million, up from $128 million in 1988.
   First Chicago's exposure to Third World debt was reduced by
about $350 million during the fourth quarter to around $1.3 billion.

<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said its
phone system experienced problems nationwide Monday connecting
long-distance calls.
   Callers to many areas received a recording saying that all
circuits were busy and that calls could not be put through.
   ``It seems to be affecting major cities in various parts of the
country,'' said AT&amp;T spokesman Burke Stinson, at the company's
Basking Ridge, N.J. offices.
   ``No one has a theory yet what's causing it,'' he said. ``We've
got our people on the case.''
   He said the problem first was noticed shortly after 2:30 p.m.
EST.
   ``It's sort of ubiquitous throughout our network,'' said Daisy
Ottmann, an AT&amp;T spokeswoman in Basking Ridge.
   ``It's a technical problem,'' she said. ``It's not a cable cut.
It's not a natural disaster.''
   She said the problem might be in the computer software that
operates the phone switching equipment.
   She said the phone company's equipment automatically blocks
calls from entering the phone network when there is a problem such
as Monday's. That, she said, accounts for the recordings callers
were receiving.

<HEAD>Former Saudi Oil Minister Launches Energy Studies Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former Saudi Arabian oil minister, Sheik Ahmed
Zaki Yamani, launched on Monday the Center for Global Energy
Studies which he said was aimed at encouraging cooperation among
oil producers, companies and consumers to avoid another oil crisis.
   ``International cooperation between multinational companies, the
consuming countries' governments and OPEC producers, particularly
in the (Persian) Gulf, is essential and should be fostered by all
means possible,'' Yamani said in launching of the London-based
center.
   There are 13 members in OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   Debate and cooperation are essential to avert another crisis, he
said in his speech to the British Institute of Energy Economics.
   ``If no action is taken now, the world may well be headed
towards another damaging oil crisis,'' he said.
   Oil prices rose to more than $30 a barrel in the 1970s and
tumbled to below $10 a barrel in the mid-1980s. The price of the
February contract of West Texas intermediate, the benchmark grade
of U.S. crude oil, has been between $22 and $23 a barrel in recent
days on the New York Mercantiler Exchange.
   Oil capacity needs to be increased but oil producers need
financial help to do this, Yamani said.
   The center aims to contribute toward the ``development of a
trilateral spirit of cooperation by bringing together the different
issues and reconciling opposing points of view so as to increase
our understanding of energy,'' he said.
   Yamani was Saudi Arabia's oil minister from 1962 until 1986.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher in Thin Trading; Gold Rises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies Monday in light trading, as holidays in Japan and the
United States sharply reduced worldwide activity.
   Gold prices also advanced. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a late bid of $414.80 a troy ounce, up from $414.50 late
Friday. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $413.70 a troy ounce from $413.20 last Friday.
   Dealers said trading activity was reduced due to the Martin
Luther King Day holiday in the United States and a national holiday
in Japan, both of which closed banks _ the biggest players in the
world foreign-exchange market.
   Most New York banks limited their activity to executing a few
orders for corporate customers, and there was no clear trend to the
dollar's movements, said Charles Annunziato, a trader at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``It's such a thin market, maybe it's not a reliable guide,''
said the chief corporate dealer at a Swiss bank in London, who
asked not to be named.
   Dealers in Europe said the dollar's rise was fueled by a
weakening of the West German mark against the Japanese yen and
against the British pound.
   The mark was pushed lower by an initial drop in Frankfurt, West
Germany, share prices which was sharper than many traders had
expected following Friday's fall on Wall Street. The mark has
derived support in recent months from foreign investor interest in
West German shares.
   With markets closed in Japan, the dollar was trading in London
at 145.50 Japanese yen late Monday, up from 145.35 yen in Tokyo
last Friday. By the end of trading in New York, the dollar was
quoted at 145.55 yen, down from 145.74 yen there late Friday.
   In London, the pound fell to $1.6620 from $1.6705 late Friday.
Later, in New York, a pound cost $1.6630, more expensive than late
Friday's $1.6610.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.6967 West German marks, up from 1.6860; 1.5110
Swiss francs, up from 1.4975; 5.7635 French francs, up from 5.7410;
1,261.75 Italian lire, up from 1,256.00; and 1.1657 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1573.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.6965 West German marks, up from 1.6785; 1.5120
Swiss francs, up from 1.4940; 5.7625 French francs, up from 5.7155;
1.9015 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8870; 1,261.375 Italian lire, up
from 1,252.00; and 1.1622 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1560.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $412.00 a troy ounce, down
from $416.25 bid late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid
of $412.40, down from $416.75 bid late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 49 cents to close at a bid
$412.10.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.24 a troy
ounce, down from $5.36 bid late Friday. On New York's Comex, silver
for current delivery closed at $5.242 a troy ounce, down from
$5.330 Friday.

<HEAD>Junk Bond Prices Fall After Campeau Filing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Junk bond prices fell Monday after a bankruptcy
court filing by two Campeau Corp. units, whose financial troubles
triggered the high-yield bond market's severe tailspin last fall.
   ``Whenever that happens it is a disturbing event and it's a drag
on the market and it was,'' said Robert Lupo, director of
high-yield bond research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Traders said issues of high-yield bonds on average fell about \
point to { point. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change
of $10 for every $1,000 in face value of the bond. The widely
watched 13.71 percent RJR Holdings Capital Corp. bond due in 2009
was down about ~ point at 90~.
   The decision by Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp. to seek protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of federal bankruptcy law drew a subdued reaction because it had
been expected, traders said.
   The two units of Toronto-based Campeau operate 260 stores in the
United States, including Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh, Abraham &amp;
Straus, Lazarus and Stern's.
   ``I don't think there's any major market participant who's
surprised,'' said David Fineman, a trader in Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.'s Beverly Hills, Calif., high-yield division. ``The shock to
the market in Federated came months ago.''
   Some analysts attributed the dull reaction to the bankruptcy
filings, made in Cincinnati, where Federated and Allied are based,
to light activity on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
   ``There might be some additional pressure to come from all this
once everybody's back to their desks,'' Lupo said.
   The government securities market was closed Monday. Prices of
corporate and municipal bonds were slightly lower in quiet trading,
said Eric Friedlander, a corporate bond trader with
Prudential-Bache Securities Corp.
   Junk bonds also fell sharply on Friday in tandem with a sharp
drop in the stock market. Monday's decline was the junk market's
fourth straight.
   The $210 billion high-yield bond market has slumped since
Campeau's surprise disclosure of liquidity problems last September.
Prices have not recovered entirely and new issues of junk bonds
have been squelched because of the sell-off.
   For the 1989 fourth quarter, analysts said, high-yield bonds
showed a total return of negative 4 percent.
   Federated and Allied bonds were mostly lower Monday. Allied 10.5
percent junk bonds declined more than two points to 42, while 11.5
percent bonds were unchanged at 11. Federated bonds yielding 16
percent were down about two points to 12.
   Bonds of Ralphs Grocery Co., a Campeau-owned southern California
chain, took the day's biggest hit, down about three points at 95.
Ralphs was not included in the bankruptcy filing but traders said
there is concern bondholders may seek to claim they were defrauded
because of Campeau's troubles.
   Among other notable issues, RJR 13.71 percent bonds due in 2007
were down about { point at 79&lsqb;. R.H. Macy &amp; Co. bonds due in 2001
were down nearly a point at 84|.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered the ratings on
all Allied and Federated subordinated debt because of the filing.
Moody's said about $2.2 billion in Federated and $1.6 billion in
Allied debt securities were affected. It said the companies were in
default on a $2.34 billion bank loan.
   Due to the bankruptcy filing, the Allied and Federated bonds
were trading ``flat,'' that is, without accrued interest. Junk
bonds normally pay interest twice a year. In flat trading, sellers
do not receive interest accrued from the last payment and buyers do
not have to pay it.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds 92~, down 3-32 point. The average yield to
maturity rose to 7.30 percent from 7.29 percent late Friday.

   Venezuelan Energy Minister Celestino
Armas on Wednesday opened a round of meetings between Venezuela and
Canada to discuss mutual cooperation on technical oil matters.
   It is the fifth round of meetings at this level since both
nations agreed to exchange oil information in 1985.
   The meeting reflects a growing cooperation between both oil
producing nations. Last year, Armas announced the creation of an
oil consortium that would include several Latin American oil
producing nations plus Canada and Italy.
   It was not known if details of the plan would be discussed
during the meeting.
   Petroleos de Venezuela, the Venezuelan oil conglomerate, and
Canada's Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority signed
a scientific and technological cooperation agreement in 1988.
   The Canadian delegation is presided over by David Oulton,

   The meetings are expected to end on Wednesday.

   Petroleum futures nosedived Monday amid
profit-taking and investor worries about mounting heating oil
supplies.
   Analysts said warmer weather and growing imports were
contributing to a build-up in heating oil inventories just weeks
after investor worries about possible heating oil shortages sent
prices soaring to decade highs.
   ``It became clear the middle of last week that the fears were
unfounded as cargos of heating oil were arriving at New York
ports,'' said Tom Bentz, director of futures trading for United
Energy Inc.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
No. 2 heating oil tumbled 5.05 cents to settle at 64.60 cents a
gallon, erasing nearly half of last week's gains of 11.17 cents a
gallon. Contracts for delivery after February lost between 1.70
cents and 2 cents.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures also fell sharply, pressured by
weakness in the heating oil market, analysts said.
   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 77 cents to $22.36 a barrel, partly
on profit-taking after recent gains. March crude lost 64 cents to
$21.49 and April declined 56 cents to $20.95 a barrel.
   February unleaded gasoline sank 1.50 cents to 63.59 cents a
gallon, while March fell 1.21 cents to 63.04 cents and April ended
at 62.92 cents a gallon, down 1.14 cents.
   Analysts said talk of a possible strike at Petrobras, Brazil's
state-run oil company, kept gasoline futures from falling further.
Brazil currently ships three to six cargos of gasoline to the
United States a month, said Bentz. One cargo contains 225,000
barrels.
   ``A strike would affect us if it's long-term,'' Bentz said.
   Analysts said worries about possible heating oil shortages in
recent weeks brought a slew of imports from Europe and other
countries.
   The concern was prompted by unusually frigid weather in many
parts of the United States as well as refinery problems, including
a fire and explosion at a huge Exxon refinery in December that
closed the facility for several days.
   ``It looks as if more supply is coming from Europe than before
and that has kicked the bottom from heating oil and also weakened
gasoline,'' said James Steel, an analyst at Refco Inc.

   International Multifoods Corp. announced
Monday that it had agreed to sell its Mister Donut franchising
operations in the United States and Canada to rival Dunkin' Donuts
Inc.
   The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, if completed
would combine the franchised doughnut shop chains that are the two
biggest in North America on the basis of sales.
   Dunkin' Donuts, which was acquired late last year by Britain's
Allied-Lyons PLC, has some 1,600 franchised shops in North America,
while No. 2 Mister Donut has 558 U.S. and Canadian franchises.
   International Multifoods said Mister Donut's 475-store U.S.
operation would be sold to Dunkin' Donuts and the 83-store Canadian
operation will be sold to Allied-Lyons Canada Limited, of Toronto.
   The transaction is scheduled to close by the end of February.
Terms under the definitive agreement announced Monday were not
disclosed.
   ``Over the past several years, we have concentrated our
development in food service on food processing and specialty
distribution,'' said Tony Luiso, chairman, president and chief
executive officer of International Multifoods.
   ``Though the Mister Donut system is strong and the business is
profitable, franchising is not part of our long-term strategic
direction,'' Luiso said.
   Mister Donut had franchisee sales of about $156 million for its
U.S. and Canadian businesses in fiscal 1989.
   In the nine months ended July 29, Dunkin' Donuts reported total
earnings of $7.62 million on revenue of $89.7 million down from a
profit of $9.86 million on revenue of $82.4 million in the same
period a year earlier.
   International Multifoods plans to continue serving both Mister
Donut and Dunkin' Donuts' franchisees as a supplier of bakery
ingredients.
   Multifoods, with fiscal 1989 sales of $1.9 billion, is a
diversified food company with major operations in the United
States, Canada and Venezuela.
   Allied-Lyons, a diversified food and beverage conglomerate,
acquired Dunkin' Donuts late last year for $325 million. The deal
ended the chain's seven-month battle to thwart a hostile bid led by
Unicorp Canada Corp. and partner Cara Operations.
   Richard Hart, a spokesman for Dunkin' Donuts, said he does not
expect the government to raise antitrust objections to the Mister
Donut deal. He said there is a ``huge, huge, huge'' number of
competitors selling donuts, including bakeries, grocery stores and
individually owned donut shops.
   Hart said the shops initially will retain their separate
identities, but the company will test the idea of converting Mister
Donut shops to Dunkin' Donuts shops.

<HEAD>Automakers Hope Incentives, Plant Shutdowns, Will Shrink
Inventories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. automakers, wrestling with a depressed
market, head into 1990 with an inventory swollen nearly 40 percent
over last year's level and hopes that temporary factory shutdowns
and incentives will shrink it.
   The eight major automakers who make cars in the U.S. report
early-January sales Tuesday, the first reporting period of a year
most industry officials and analysts have said will be weaker than
1989, when about 14.8 million new vehicles hit American roads.
   The weekly Ward's Automotive Reports in Detroit said Monday
dealers had a 91-day supply of new, North American-built cars on
hand as of Dec. 31. Fast Track News in Wayne, Pa. showed a 92-day
supply at the same time.
   Ward's said that at the same time in 1988, dealers had a 66-day
supply, one day less than what Fast Track News estimated. The 1988
figure was effected by a late-December, incentive-inspired buying
spree.
   The automakers are gambling that production cuts and incentives
will shrivel inventories this month. The companies were shut down
Monday because of the observance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday.
   On Dec. 15, Chrysler Corp. announced an enhanced incentive
package which was matched to some degree by Ford Motor Co.
   And by the end of this month, more than 120,000 auto workers
each will have spent at least a week away from their jobs on
temporary layoff as the companies tried to bring production into
line with stock.
   ``Production in January, coupled by fairly aggressive
incentives, suggest that inventories will come down by the end of
the first quarter,'' analyst John Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
of New York said Monday.
   At this time of year, a supply of 70 to 75 days is considered
normal. Automakers usually aren't bothered by supplies creeping up
a little in January and February in anticipation of a rush of sales
in March and April.
   But things are different this year.
   The auto industry went into a slump at nearly the same moment as
the 1990 model year officially started Oct. 1. Fear of 1990 model
price increases and scaled-back incentive programs drove
prospective buyers into showrooms in August and September.
   Because of that, automakers expected depressed sales in October
and November, and they got what they expected. But what they may
not have expected was that the slump would continue.
   To deal with the combined effects of lower consumer demand and
increasing inventories, automakers shut down plants. And the
production reduction spread beyond the Big Three of Ford, Chrysler
and General Motors Corp.
   In the past, U.S. plants operated wholly or partly by Japanese
companies, called ``transplants,'' have been immune from cutbacks
because demand for their vehicles has held up while orders for cars
made by the Big Three sagged.
   That's changed for some of the products coming from three plants
making cars shipped to U.S. dealers under Japanese and U.S. car
company nameplates.
   Mazda Motor Corp.'s Flat Rock, Mich., plant; the GM-Toyota Motor
Corp. plant in Fremont, Calif., and the Chrysler-Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. joint venture in Normal, Ill., each have announced production
reductions.
   The reductions have come in cars carrying U.S. company
nameplates _ the Ford Probe from Flat Rock, the Geo Prizm sold by
Chevrolet dealers from the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.
plant in California and the Plymouth Laser from the Diamond-Star
Motors Corp. plant in Illinois.

<HEAD>Heating Oil Futures Plunge As Weather Warms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heating oil futures prices tumbled Monday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as unseasonably warm weather spread across the
country, easing demand for home heating fuel.
   On other commodity markets, orange juice futures ended mixed
after soaring early in the session. Futures prices for precious
metals, grains and soybeans, and livestock and meat also finished
mixed.
   Most wholesale heating oil futures fell 1.85 cents to 2 cents,
the permitted daily limit. The contract for delivery in February,
on which the limit has been lifted pending its Jan. 31 expiration,
crashed 5.05 cents to settle at 64.60 cents a gallon.
   Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil tumbled 22
cents to 77 cents with February at $22.36 a barrel; unleaded
gasoline futures settled 1.14 cents to 1.5 cents lower with
February at 63.59 cents a gallon.
   The plunge in heating oil prices marked the first downturn in
the February contract in a week. The sell-off was largely a
reaction to springlike weather in much of the northern United
States, especially the populous Northeast, where record-breaking
cold in December had spurred strong demand for heating oil and
pushed prices up sharply.
   ``December's temperatures were 20 percent below normal and now
it looks like January may end up 20 percent above normal,'' said
Jim Ritterbusch, vice president of trading and research with Carson
Petroleum Co., a Chicago-area oil distributor.
   ``By the time this whole thing shakes out, we're probably going
to be close to normal winter weather,'' he said.
   Orange juice for January delivery fell sharply on the New York
Cotton Exchange but prices for all other contracts ended moderately
higher after initially surging the 5-cent limit in reaction to last
week's Agriculture Department crop report.
   The report pegged the frost-damaged 1989-90 Florida orange crop
at 91 million 90-pound boxes and put the expected juice yield at
1.3 gallons per box. Both forecasts were lower than expected and
compare with the previous year's harvest of 130 million boxes and
yield of 1.48 gallons per box.
   Orange juice futures prices had soared their daily limits on
Friday in reaction to the report, which followed a devastating
Christmas-weekend freeze.
   Monday's early runup represented the tail end of Friday's buying
before profit-taking cut the gains, said Ernie Thomas, an orange
juice specialist with Merrill Lynch Consumer Martkets Inc. in
Winterhaven, Fla.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 6.25 cents lower to 2
cents higher with January at $1.9125 a pound.
   Gold futures edged higher while silver futures fell sharply on
New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold's finish represented a comeback from moderate losses
earlier in the day. Silver was pressured by abundant supplies of
the metal.
   Gold settled 10 cents to 50 cents higher with February at
$414.70 a troy ounce; silver was 8.8 cents to 9.6 cents lower with
March at $5.298 a troy ounce.
   Corn futures rose modestly in broad-based buying on the Chicago
Board of Trade while wheat and soybean futures retreated slightly.
   Corn's advance apparently was related to last week's Agriculture
Department crop report, which pegged both the 1989 U.S. corn
harvest and the nation's corn stockpile at levels that were lower
than the market had expected.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 3\ cents lower with March at
$3.99{ a bushel; corn futures were unchanged to 1} cents higher
with March at $2.43} a bushel; oats were { cent to } cent higher
with March at $1.43{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3 cents
lower with January at $5.64 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in lackluster trading.
   Live cattle futures settled .30 cent lower to .20 cent higher
with February at 77.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent
to .50 cent lower with January at 83.35 cents a pound; live hogs
were .37 cent lower to .25 cent higher with February at 50.30 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .17 cent lower to .10 cent higher
with February at 55.30 cents a pound.

<HEAD>GE Furloughs 1,700 Workers For One Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOMERSWORTH, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. plans to close its
factory in Somersworth, idling nearly 1,700 workers for a week Jan.
22-26 because of slowing orders, the company said Monday.
   Zelda Kenney, GE spokeswoman, said the production workers will
be given the choice of taking the week as vacation or claiming
unemployment benefits for the week. She said the temporary shutdown
is designed to avoid laying off workers. The factory makes meters
that are installed in houses to measure how much electricity is
used. The slowdown in orders comes from a drop in the number of
houses and other structures being built, she said, adding that GE
sells meters to utilities and utilities rely heavily on a steady
flow of construction.
   Kenney said utilities are placing orders with GE at a slower
rate than usual, and the week off is meant to build up a backlog of
orders so that employees can return to work at their usual rate.
   The region's economic slowdown, she added, is another indirect
cause for the drop in orders.

   Prices declined broadly on Wall Street Monday as
pessimism about the economy _ which sent stocks sharply lower on
Friday _ took a further toll on the market.
   ``They don't see any reason to take an aggressive stand on the
buy side,'' Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said
of traders.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.84 to 2,669.37.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 11 to 4 in
nationwide-trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
395 stocks rising, 1,091 falling and 466 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a moderate 140.59
million shares, down from 183.88 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 168.13 million shares.
   Analysts said the malaise that settled over Wall Street after
two negative economic reports on Friday remained in place Monday.
   The government had reported that wholesale prices surged 0.7
percent during December while retail sales rose a sluggish 0.2
percent. The combination of accelerating inflation and a softening
economy unnerved many investors and stock prices fell sharply
Friday, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbling more
than 71 points.
   Bargain-hunters who might normally enter the market after a
sharp loss stayed one the sidelines Monday, said Dennis Jarrett, an
analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. Jarrett described traders as
apathetic.
   Analysts said many traders were waiting to see what trend might
emerge from the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which was closed Monday for a
holiday. The Japanese stock market had its worst decline in two
years Friday, contributing to Wall Street's dismal performance.
   Among standouts on the NYSE Monday, Rorer Group soared 13} to 63
after the pharmaceutical firm said it was negotating with an
unidentified merger partner.
   Sea Containers plunged 7&rsqb; to 59&rsqb; after Temple Holdings Ltd. said
it would drop a hostile offer for Sea Containers if the ferry
company agreed to sell substantial parts of its ferry and container
assets to Temple.
   Monsanto fell 4&lsqb; to 112{ after an investment firm lowered its
rating of the chemical maker.
   Ralston Purina rose 1\ to 83{ after setting $84.25 a share as

   Philip Morris led the NYSE's most active list, falling | to 38&lsqb;.
Among other blue chip issues, AT&amp;T fell | to 42|, IBM rose \ to
98&lsqb;, and General Motors fell &rsqb; to 41\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market fell $28.681 billion, or 0.87
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped 1.61 to 186.71.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.27 to 387.45, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index lost 2.93 to close at 337.00.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rorer Group Inc. stock soared Monday after
the drugmaker said it was negotiating a deal to sell a 68 percent
stake to another company.
   A merger would be the latest consolidation in the worldwide
pharmaceutical industry, which has been reshaped by major unions
among big-name companies in the last year.
   Rorer stock was up $13.75 to $63, or 28 percent, in late New
York Stock Exchange trading in very heavy volume. Final stock
prices was not available due to telephone line problems.
   Rorer, based in suburban Fort Washington, said in a statement it
was negotiating a ``strategic transaction'' with an unidentified
company that would acquire 68 percent of Rorer's outstanding common
shares.
   Rorer said the deal was designed to make it ``a larger, stronger
worldwide pharmaceutical company.'' It said the company would
remain publicly traded and that current shareholders would retain a
position of about 32 percent.
   The statement said the transaction is ``modeled'' on a merger
last July in which Dow Chemical Co. last July agreed to acquire 67
percent of Marion Laboratories Inc. stock over the next two to
three years.
   Rorer spokesman John Donahue declined to elaborate on the
statement.
   In addition to the Dow-Marion deal, other multibillion-dollar
mergers over the last year included SmithKline Beckman Corp. with
Britain's Beecham Group PLC and Bristol-Myers Co. with Squibb Corp.
Also, American Home Products Corp. agreed to acquire A.H. Robins
Co. and Eastman Kodak Co. bought Sterling Drug. Inc.
   Edward Stavetski, an industry analyst with W.H. Newbold's Son &amp;
Co. in Philadelphia, said Rorer may be seeking to remain stay
competitive in light of the recent merger wave.
   ``The rest of the drug industry has forced this,'' he said,
adding that he believed the acquiring company would likely be
foreign.
   Analyst Michael Martorelli with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia said there was speculation last week that Rorer was
negotiating a merger and its stock climbed on the rumors.
   Rorer's statement said current shareholders would receive a
package including cash and securities valued at $73 a share. That
price may have triggered the large jump in Rorer stock on Monday,
analysts said.
   Rorer develops, makes and markets prescription and
over-the-counter drugs and hospital products in more than 100
countries.
   Rorer is planning to build new headquarters in Upper Providence
Township outside Philadelphia. Another major pharmaceutical
company, Sterling Drug, has plans to build a new research and
development complex in the same area.

<HEAD>US Chip Consortium Dissolves After Failing To Draw Adequate
Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATALINA ORTIZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Memories, a joint venture
created to expand America's small share of the computer chip
market, is dissolving because of inadequate financial support from
the industry, it was announced Monday.
   ``What we saw was an unwillingness to support sufficient equity
as well as purchase commitments to go forward,'' said company
president Sanford L. Kane.
   At the same time, he criticized the industry for concentrarting
on short-term tactics rather than long-term strategy.
   U.S. Memories, hailed by American companies when it was formed
last June to invest $1 billion in a chip-making plant, decided to
terminate the venture after a meeting Wednesday in Dallas with the
original seven investing companies and four other potential backers.
   Two original backers, International Business Machines Corp. and
Digital Equipment Corp., maintained their major commitment to the
venture, but Kane said the others were not willing to put up enough
money to fund the venture's first plant or agree to buy enough of
its 4-megabit dynamic random access memory chips, or DRAMs.
   ``From early on we all knew the viability of U.S. Memories was
contingent on (that),'' Kane said at a news conference.
   American computer companies depend heavily on foregin
manufacturers _ primarily those in Japan _ for DRAMS, a common form
of chip important in computers, household appliances and the U.S.
defense system. They often are compared to crude oil in their
importance to industry.
   U.S. Memories, which estimated that American companies currently
supply no more than 10 percent of the American demand for the
chips, hoped to produce 25 percent of the DRAMS needed by U.S.
computer companies.
   Inadequate supply and high cost of DRAMs prompted the formation
of U.S. Memories last year. In addition to IBM and Digital,
original investors included Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel Corp.,
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., National Semiconductor Corp. and LSI
Logic.
   But since then, supply has increased and the price has dropped,
largely because several new companies, including Samsung of South
Korea, have begun making the chips, according to analysts. U.S.
companies needing DRAMs apparently no longer think they have a
problem, Kane said.
   J. Richard Iverson, president of the American Electronics
Association, which supports efforts to increase the U.S. share of
the chip market, said, ``I don't know what we could have done
more.''
   ``There's no way of coercing companies into doing what we think
is right _ or what they think is right. These are individual
business decisions,'' he said.
   Kane also would not criticize electronics companies for their
individual decisions not to give U.S. Memories as much financial
support as the consortium hoped. But he was ``extremely
disappointed'' and worried about the future of America's
electronics industry.
   ``What happens today does not bode well ... ``It is a sign of
where we are going,'' said Kane, who said the developments showed
an inability of American electronics companies to cooperate.
   ``We're kind of like an all-star sports team. We have a number
of superstars who are individually great in their way but can't
work together,'' he said.
   U.S. Memories originally planned to pay for the computer chip
plant with $500 million in equity financing from chip makers and
users and $500 million in debt, with fund raising expected to be
completed last year.
   The consortium later decided it would need $400 million in debt
and $350 million in equity _ $150 million from industry investors
and the rest from outside backers. Computer companies, however,
also would have had to agree to buy 75 to 80 percent of the
consortium's DRAMs.
   But the plant was never built and no chips were produced.
   Despite Monday's announcement, Kane said the venture had
produced some positive results.
   ``We did achieve some significant things in the process,'' Kane
said. ``We showed that with some creativity and support and
teamwork we could come up with a solution within the American
framework. We clearly increased the impact of the seimconductor
industry and DRAMs in particular.''

<HEAD>ALPA Votes to Extend Strike Benefits to Eastern Pilots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Line Pilots Association announced Monday
that a majority of its members had voted to continue payments
through the end of February to Eastern Airlines pilots who had been
on strike and still haven't found jobs.
   The vote called for maintaining strike benefits, but at a
reduced level, through the end of next month.
   ALPA spokeswoman Julie Reneau declined to provide the vote
tally, saying only that a simple majority of the returned ballots
was needed to maintain the payments.
   ``I'm grateful to them,'' Skip Copeland, head of the ALPA
chapter at Eastern, said in a telephone interview from Miami. ``It
sustains the Eastern pilots a little while longer while we get our
life back in order.''
   Most of the 2,400 or so striking Eastern pilots voted Nov. 22 to
abandon their nine-month sympathy walkout, after President Bush
vetoed legislation to set up a blue-ribbon commission to look into
the strike. None of the pilots, or the flight attendants who ended
their strike soon afterward, were subsequently taken back by
Eastern _ which had hired non-union replacement workers and
accepted some striking workers who crossed picket lines earlier.
   The Machinists union remains on strike against the Miami-based
carrier.
   The 40,000 or so ALPA members nationwide had been paying about 3
percent of their salary to their Eastern colleagues. The benefits
to Eastern pilots have averaged about $2,400 a month per flier
since the walkout began last March 4.
   Following the new ALPA vote, the benefits will be cut to an
average $1,600 a month on Jan. 14 and to $1,400 a month on Feb. 1.
They will end on Feb. 28.

   NCR Corp. said Monday its fourth-quarter
earnings declined 1 percent, partly because of higher research and
development costs and its stock buyback program.
   NCR said it earned $147 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31,
down from $149 million in the same period a year earlier.
   The company reported per-share earnings of $2.02, up from $1.85
a year earlier. NCR said it repurchased 9 million shares during
1989, which raised its per-share performance but helped lower its
overall earnings.
   Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $1.79 billion, down slightly from
last year's $1.8 billion, NCR said.
   NCR attributed the earnings decline to higher investment in
research and development, lower revenue and gross profit margins
and the stock repurchase program.
   The company said it partially offset those declines by reducing
operating expenses.
   For the full year, NCR earned $412 million, down 6 percent from
the $439 million it posted in 1988. Per-share earnings were $5.38,
up from $5.33 the previous year.
   The company's 1989 revenue totaled $5.96 billion, down 1 percent
from the $5.99 billion of the previous year.
   The company makes, sells and services business information
processing systems for worldwide markets.

<HEAD>New Campbell CEO Asks Dissident Shareholders To Give Him A Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY STERN</BYLINE>

   The new head of Campbell Soup Co. said
Monday that he believed the troubled foods giant could show
different operating results within a year, but he wanted to focus
more on long-term gains.
   David W. Johnson, Campbell's new president and chief executive,
also told a news conference that the best way to keep the
120-year-old company independent was for its controlling Dorrance
family _ recently beset by bickering over whether to sell Campbell
_ to hold on to its shares.
   Campbell's board of directors appointed Johnson on Jan. 3,
saying the 57-year-old Australian was brought from Gerber Products
Co. because of his experience in turning around beleaguered
companies.
   In addition to recently lackluster financial results, Campbell
faces dissension among its biggest shareholders over whether to
sell the company.
   A group led by three grandchildren of company founder John T.
Dorrance Sr., which owns 17.4 percent of Campbell's stock, has
announced it wants to sell its stake and encouraged the board of
directors to put the entire company on the block.
   Three other Dorrance grandchildren who own 31.3 percent of the
stock say they want to keep their shares and maintain the company's
independence.
   ``I don't think there's anything wrong with a family to have
disagreements,'' Johnson said.
   He said the best way for the company to maintain its
independence was for the Dorrance heirs to keep their shares.
   Johnson arrived at Gerber in 1987, after the baby food company's
market share had dropped to 52 percent from 67 percent. The decline
was attributed to a safety scare after glass shards were found in
some of the company's products, although the Food and Drug
Administration later absolved Gerber of any responsibility for the
problem.
   At Gerber, Johnson sold off businesses unrelated to the baby
food operations and made other changes credited for a financial
performance that enabled the company to raise its dividends from 66
cents per share in 1987 to the present 96 cents per share.
   Johnson replaces R. Gordon McGovern, who announced his early
retirement in November after serving as president and chief
executive since 1980. Analysts have said that unhappy shareholders
forced McGovern's retirement.
   Johnson told an audience of about 200 Campbell employees that in
the the company's restructuring, ``there will inevitably be
divestitures and redundancies.
   ``We will try to become leaner and meaner through natural
attrition; that is by not replacing people who leave or retire,''
he said.
   However, Johnson also told reporters that it was too early to
advocate either divestitures or acquisitions for the company, which
had $5.7 billion in sales in fiscal 1989.
   ``I came here with no predispositions,'' Johnson said. ``I came
in here really to do my homework.''
   Johnson said the company falls at the bottom of the food
products industry in its earnings per share growth, which has been
8 percent to 9 percent annually in recent years. That number should
be in the 12 percent to 15 percent range, he said.
   In its first fiscal quarter ended Oct. 29 Campbell posted a
profit of $83 million, or 64 cents a share, on sales of $1.52
billion, compared with a profit of $69.4 million, or 54 cents per
share, on sales of $1.33 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Apple Says Expenses, Jobs Will Be Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. said Monday it will
cut its work force, possibly in part through layoffs, and will
freeze some salaries for six months because of slumping revenues.
   The personal computer maker also announced that it was
eliminating company cars for U.S.-based executives and cutting back
its profit-sharing plan.
   Though first-quarter figures will not be ready until Thursday,
``we know that revenues and profits will not meet our expectations
for this quarter,'' John Sculley, Apple's chairman, president and
chief executive officer, said in a letter to the company's 12,000
employees.
   ``In various parts of the world, Apple's growth is slower than
we anticipated in our (fiscal year 1990) business plan. Given these
results, we are re-examining our outlook for (fiscal year) 1990 and
are taking immediate actions to bring expense growth better in line
with revenue growth.''
   Sculley did not say how many jobs could be eliminated. He said
there would be ``normal head count attrition,'' a ``significant
drop in hiring activity,'' consolidation of some areas and
transfers of some employees.
   ``It will also be necessary to eliminate positions,'' he said.
   ``We're not ruling out layoffs,'' said company spokeswoman Carla
LeVasseur. She said the only recent layoffs involved 60 employees
in Canada on Dec. 13. In addition, 100 employees in the U.S. sales
and marketing divisions were ``redeployed'' in September, she said,
taking new assignments within Apple or leaving the company.
   Ms. LeVasseur blamed the company's slump on a general slowdown
in the computer industry. But Apple also has been hurt by sagging
sales of some of its leading product lines, particularly several
models of the Macintosh and the Apple II personal computers, during
a time in which it stressed more powerful models for corporate use.
   Sculley's letter said all professional-level employees would
move from a six-month to a 12-month salary review schedule,
effective immediately. Ms. LeVasseur said this meant they would get
no raises for at least six months. Vice presidents and executive
staff members, who got no regular raises last year, will also get
none this year.
   The profit-sharing plan, which paid $49.4 million to employees
last year, will be scaled back on April to a plan that ``is more
closely tied to Apple's financial performance goals,'' Sculley said.
   Ms. LeVasseur said the phase-out of company automobiles by April
1 would affect over 100 U.S. executives.

<HEAD>Georgia Gulf Announces Recapitalization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia Gulf Corp., which has been trying to fend
off corporate raider Harold C. Simmons, said Monday its board
approved a debt-financed recapitalization plan that would give
stockholders a one-time cash payment.
   Under the plan, which is subject to approval by stockholders and
government regulators, each share of common stock could be
converted into cash and new shares of stock, the company said.
   No date has been set for a stockholders' meeting, the
Atlanta-based chemical company said.
   Georgia Gulf said the recapitalization will be financed with up
to $730 million of debt and the sale of about $200 million in
debentures, with financing backed by Chase Manhattan Bank, Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, Security Pacific National Bank and
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
   Under the plan, each share of the company's common stock could
be converted into $38 cash, one share of a new series of preferred
stock and one new share of common stock.
   Stockholders will have the option of converting up to 30 percent
of their common shares into ``a number of shares'' of the new
common stock, instead of taking the cash, preferred stock and
common.
   Georgia Gulf estimated the value of the deal will be up to $55 a
share, depending on the number of stockholders who opt to receive
only common stock.
   The company had been examining ways to boost its stock price
since Simmons' Dallas-based NL Industries began acquiring Georgia
Gulf stock last summer.
   No tender offer has been made, but NL Industries has acquired
about 9.9 percent of Georgia Gulf stock at an average price of $37
per share, NL Industries officials said.
   NL Industries has said it would not oppose a recapitalization if
it resulted in Georgia Gulf stock hitting $50 a share.
   Calls to Simmons and his associates were not answered late
Monday.
   Under Georgia Gulf's recapitalization plan, the preferred stock
would be ``redeemable at the company's option at any time'' and
have a redemption value of $17 a share, the company said. However,
the preferred stock is ``expected to trade at a price per share
that is significantly less than the redemption price,'' the company
said.
   Georgia Gulf said the plan ``is intended to maximize stockholder
value in the near term'' while safeguarding the stockholders'
long-term investment in the company.

<HEAD>$60 Million Lawsuit Against Texas Air Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $60 million lawsuit filed by 273 former
Continental Airlines pilots against Texas Air Corp., the parent
company of Continental, was dismissed Monday, Texas Air said.
   The ex-pilots claimed that Texas Air had guaranteed
Continental's adherence to a collective bargaining agreement that
was terminated after Continental filed for protection under Chapter
11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code in 1983.
   The state court granted a motion by Texas Air attorneys for a
summary judgment on all the pilot's claims, the company said.
   Spokesmen for the Air Line Pilots Association in Houston and
Washington, D.C., were not in their offices and could not be
reached for comment immediately.
   The Texas case is the largest of three suits brought by former
pilots seeking to hold Texas Air responsible for damages under a
side letter to the pilot's 1982 labor agreement. A side letter is
an agreement between a union and company that is not part of the
actual labor contract.
   One case, involving 48 ex-pilots, is pending in a Colorado state
court. Another suit was dismissed last year by a Houston federal
judge and is under appeal.
   Houston-based Continental emerged from Chapter 11 in 1986, and
has largely completed payments under its plan of reorganization.
   Texas Air, also based in Houston, also owns Eastern Airlines.

   Laurence J. Peter, whose ``Peter Principle''
held that bureaucratic problems often occur because employees
routinely are promoted beyond their competence, died Sunday of
natural causes. He was 70.
   Peter and Raymond Hull wrote the 1969 best-seller, ``The Peter
Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong,'' a satirical chronicle of
incompetence based on Peter's experience with educational and other
bureaucracies.
   His book sold 8 million copies, was translated into more than 30
languages and is still available in paperback.
   Peter followed ``The Peter Principle'' with eight other books,
including ``The Peter Prescription: How to Make Things Go Right''
in 1972 and ``The Peter Plan: A Proposal for Survival'' in 1975.
   Peter is survived by his wife, sons John and Edward, daughters
Alice and Margaret and three grandchildren.

   Frank LeRoux, a former U.S. Department
of Agriculture official and a passionate champion of American
agriculture, died Sunday at 82.
   The cause of death was not disclosed.
   In 1961, LeRoux was appointed general sales manager of the
Agriculture Department's Commodities Credit Corp. His work earned
him a presidential merit award, presented by Lyndon B. Johnson.
   But when LeRoux resigned his post in 1966, he lashed out at the
administrations of presidents John F. Kennedy and Johnson, calling
that period ``the worst five-year period in agriculture.'' He then
wrote a book entitled: ``1961 Through 1964: The Farmers' Worst Five
Years.''
   LeRoux published three more books on the problems of American
agriculture. His fourth book, ``The Myth of U.S. Agricultural
Prosperity,'' tells of his disillusionment with the political
treatment of his fellow farmers.
