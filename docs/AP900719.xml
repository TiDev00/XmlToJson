   Rebels on Thursday launched what
appeared to be a major offensive about three miles from the center
of the capital, witnesses said.
   Travelers from the Loganville section of Monrovia reported large
numbers of government casualties lying around the railway terminal.
One witness reported a truck loaded with government wounded rushing
toward the city's only working hospital.
   The fighting was near the Bong iron ore mines' railway and the
terminal itself, witnesses said. The railroad station, three miles
from downtown Monrovia, was the closest the rebels have yet come to
the city center after a 10-day lull in the 7-month-old civil war.
   In Washington, meanwhile, the foreign minister of Liberia and
other prominent Liberians appealed Thursday to the United States
for a temporary U.S. peacekeeping force to help prevent further
bloodshed.
   Foreign Minister J. Rudolph Johnson, Washington Ambassador
Eugenia Wordsworth-Stevenson and eight other Liberians wrote
President Bush that they expect the ``resignation and departure
from Liberia'' of President Samuel Doe ``and the establishment of
an interim government.''
   The letter proposed ``a limited U.S. force be provided, on the
invitation of that interim government, to play an initial
peacekeeping role'' in the vicinity of Monrovia.
   The appeal did not explain how the resignation and departure of
Doe would be carried out.
   Earlier Thursday, rebels ambushed government troops trying to
take a key intersection on the road to the country's international
airport, forcing them to retreat, military sources said.
   Sixty government troops were sent to recapture Red Light
Junction, six miles from downtown, the military sources said.
Forces of the rebel National Patriotic Front of Liberia ambushed
the troops, killing three.
   The junction is on the main road to the international airport at
Robertsfield, held by the rebels for several weeks. Journalists who
tried to visit the area were turned back by government troops one
mile from the fighting.
   The rebels have brought heavy artillery to the north of
Monrovia, Liberian security sources said. Armored cars and
artillery have been seen moving south from Kakata toward Monrovia
in the past two days, the sources said.
   Rebel control of parts of Lofa County, north of Monrovia, has
led government troops to turn back refugees fleeing the capital,
witnesses said.
   In the capital, food shortages and the fear of a rebel attack
increased. Up to 1,300 Lebanese living in Liberia, primarily small
businessmen and their families, have registered with the Lebanese
Embassy to leave aboard a ship en route from Tunisia.
   ``We don't feel any direct threat but there's a great deal of
looting taking place, not only businesses but houses as well,''
Lebanese Ambassador Michel Bitard said.
   The ship has been chartered by the Arab League.
   In neighboring Sierra Leone, a rebel leader, Thomas Woewiyu,
said late Thursday that no progress was made in talks between
intermediaries of the two sides. He said the rebels would not
compromise on their demand that Doe resign before a formal
cease-fire can be reached.
   The rebels, led by former Doe aide Charles Taylor, advanced to
the fringes of Monrovia before their advance was halted. Taylor
accuses Doe's government of corruption, inefficiency and human
rights abuses.
   Doe has agreed not to seek re-election but has so far refused to
leave the country. He has a force of 500 Israeli-trained troops
defending his heavily fortified residence in Monrovia.
   Random killings have been reported on both sides as the
insurgency has degenerated into tribal warfare. Most rebels come
from the Gio and Mano tribes, while government supporters are
mostly Krahns and Mandingos. Doe is a Krahn.
   Hundreds of people are streaming out of the city in the
direction of Sierra Leone. Taylor's forces have opened the highway
from the surrounded capital to the Sierra Leone border to allow
refugees to flee, military sources reported.
   Most of Monrovia has been without power for two weeks, and water
supplies have been cut. Residents have been forced to collect rain
water and forage for food as supplies dwindle and soldiers loot
what is left.
   Doe took power in a violent 1980 coup that ousted the
incumbents, descendants of American immigrants who historically
monopolized power and discriminated against indigenous Liberians.
Liberia was founded in the 19th century by freed slaves from the
United States.

   Here are selected quotations from the books
and speeches of Dr. Karl Menninger, the psychiatrist who died
Wednesday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Gone forever is the notion that the mentally ill person is an
exception. It is now accepted that most people have some degree of
mental illness at some time, and many of them have a degree of
mental illness most of the time. This should not surprise anyone,
for do not most of us have some physical illness some of the time
and some of us much of the time?'' _ from his book, ``The Vital
Balance.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``We all look for miracles in the relief of our distress, but
psychotherapy lays no claim to miracle performings. All it can do
is to present certain aspects of the truth and by this, as we are
often reminded, some are set free. Loneliness may disappear as you
know yourself better and become aware of conflicts within that
prevent you from getting close to others.'' _ from the book ``Man
Against Himself.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``(Sigmund) Freud's great courage led him to look honestly at
the evil in man's nature. Freud persisted in his researches to the
bottom of the jar, and there he found hope. He discerned that love
is stronger than hate, that, hence, for all its core of malignancy
the nature of man can be transformed through the nurture and
dispersion of love. In this way, the destructiveness can be
transcended.'' _ from the book, ``The Vital Balance.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The vast majority of ailing minds never see psychiatrists and
never will, and many of them never should. But the principles of
psychiatry should be applied all the same. Sometimes they can be
self-administered; sometimes, a friend will turn the trick. The
family doctor or clergyman often does it. And, sometimes a book
will do it.'' _ from the book, ``The Human Mind.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Most people never see the awfulness of war; they only read
about it or hear about it from reporters or survivors. War
continues to be a deputized human activity, some citizens are sent
out to do what the total citizenry couldn't and wouldn't do. The
rest of us stand, or sit, a long way off, and watch or listen
occasionally.'' _ from the book ``Whatever Became of Sin?''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``To many of us, the war in Vietnam seems a prime example of
self-destructiveness, one more likely to spread communism and other
evils than to control them. Youths are being sacrificed. Money,
materials, the country, our own national image and, in many places,
our goodwill are being destroyed in a continuing, pointless and _
as it seems to many of us _ futile military bonfire.'' _ Testimony
before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, June 19, 1969.

<HEAD>Earthquake Catches Government Flat-Footed, Slow To Respond</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The earthquake that struck the main
Philippines island of Luzon caught President Corazon Aquino's
government ill-prepared for disaster and dramatized her
administration's organizational shortcomings.
   Three days after the quake, which measured 7.7 on the Richter
scale, the government has no comprehensive picture of the extent of
damage and casualties.
   Relief operations appear centered in areas such as Baguio, where
media focused its attention.
   ``The immediate task is the rescue and feeding of survivors,''
said the newspaper Malaya. ``Three days after the earthquake, the
abject failure of the government on this score is appalling.''
   Even in Baguio, a lack of coordination among government agencies
was clear.
   The Office of Civil Defense counted 82 people dead in Baguio,
110 miles to the north. Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said 91
were killed, and the Red Cross estimated 118 dead.
   Poor communications forced local officials to use private radio
and television stations to alert Manila of the devastation and
appeal for help.
   Today, Rep. Simeon Garcia told radio station DZMM that about 100
motorists stranded by the quake were at his home in Nueva Ecija
province waiting for help promised by the army days ago but as yet
unreceived.
   ``Clearly, if we hope to reduce the number of deaths and the
extent of the damage wrought by natural calamities, we as a nation
must give priority to disaster monitoring, prediction and
preparedness,'' the Philippine Daily Inquirer said today.
   Problems of communication and coordination emerged within
moments of the Monday's quake, when Mrs. Aquino dispatched
officials to survey the damage in Manila and ordered the military
to ferry stranded commuters.
   Few military trucks appeared on the streets, and tens of
thousands of commuters wound up walking home.
   That typified the government's reaction to the crisis: good
intentions but neither the resources nor the organization to
implement them.
   The temblor struck about a half hour before government offices
normally close for the day. Most state employees simply went home
early, fearing another quake.
   Soon afterward, the presidential press office announced that the
government was studying the extent of damage.
   It was only after commercial radio stations broadcast damage
reports from their provincial affiliates that the government began
to respond.
   First reports focused on Cabanatuan City, 60 miles north of
Manila, where a six-story school collapsed, trapping hundreds of
students and teachers.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Aquino flew to the city for her first view of
the relief operations. Reporters who traveled with her said she was
angry over what she saw.
   ``Who's in charge?'' aides quoted her as asking local officials.
``The rescue operation is so slow. Why?''
   Only after returning from Cabanatuan did she declare a ``state
of calamity'' in affected provinces. On Wednesday, she hurredly
added La Union province to the list after radio and television
stations broadcast first reports of massive destruction there.
   The government maintains a system of regional disaster
coordinating councils which are supposed to marshal the nation's
resources to cope with calamities.
   But the regional committees lack money, equipment,
communications and trained rescue personnel. Cabanatuan Mayor
Honorato Perez used commercial radio stations to beg Manila for
cranes, jackhammers and trained rescuers.
   The government sent troops to Cabanatuan, but they were no
better trained in rescue operations than the civilian volunteers.
   In Baguio, where the temblor damaged the airport runway and cut
land routes into the city, stocks of emergency supplies and
equipment were insufficient to mount an effective relief operation.
   Even if local authorities were better equipped, the highly
centralized government structure tends to inhibit grass-roots
initiatives. The simplest request often turns into a bureaucratic
nightmare.
   For example, as the Philippines appealed to the world for help,
the Office of the President produced ``implementing guidelines''
for receiving foreign donations:
   ``Interested overseas donors or their local representatives are
to submit written offers to the presidential management staff. Once
notified of the government's acceptance, the donors are to submit a
bill of lading or airway bill for clearance by the presidential
management staff, which in turn transmits all necessary documents
to the Bureau of Customs. The Bureau of Customs, initiates the
processing of import documents and releases the donation to the
Office of the President. Finally, the Office of the President turns
over the donations to the designated recipient agency or
organization.''
   Such disorderly responses are sadly routine nearly every time
disaster strikes.
   During typhoons, comprehensive reports of damage and casualties
often take days _ or even weeks _ to reach Manila, delaying the
shipment of food, medicine and supplies to the victims.
   The lack of coordination seems all the more surprising because
an average of 20 typhoons strike the Philippines annually. Some
routinely kill hundreds.
   ``From the moment the ... quake ... struck until this very
moment, we have had to play it by ear and improvise,'' said The
Manila Times. ``Many of the hundreds of people killed in this
latest disaster could have been spared if only we had all taken to
heart the deadly serious business of disaster preparedness.''

<TEXT>
   An appeals court has thrown out the
convictions of four people sentenced to life in prison two years
ago for a 1980 bombing that killed 85 people at Bologna's train
station.
   It said after 15 days of deliberation that defendants Valerio
Fioravanti; his wife, Francesca Mambro; Massimiliano Fachini; and
Sergio Picciafuoco had not committed the crime.
   State-run RAI-TV described Wednesday's verdict as a ``shock.''
The Aug. 2, 1980, bombing was one of the worst terrorist actions in
Europe.
   The court also reversed the convictions for slander of Licio
Gelli, former grandmaster of the secret Propaganda Due (P-2)
Masonic lodge, and financier Francesco Pazienza, sentenced to 10
years in prison in the first trial.
   Prosecutors described the Bologna attack as a neo-Fascist plot
to undermine Italy's democracy, and the four convicted of planting
the bomb as right-wing terrorists.
   P-2 allegedly backed right-wing terrorism as a means of throwing
the country into confusion to pave the way for an eventual rightist
dictatorship.
   The slander charges were based on a 1981 incident when
explosives similar to those kind used at Bologna were found on a
train at Bologna's station. Prosecutors claimed Gelli and Pazienza
misled investigators by claiming the explosives were linked to
other people.

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem has
accepted the credentials of the first British ambassador to
Argentina since the two countries went to war over the Falklands in
1982.
   The war ``is an issue of the past,'' the new ambassador,
Humphrey Maud, told reporters covering the ceremony Wednesday at
the president's official residence in the suburban town of Olivos.
``Now we can think of the future.''
   Ownership of the Falklands ``is not an issue for discussion at
this moment,'' said the 56-year-old career diplomat.
   Britains rules the islands off Argentina's southern coast, but
Argentina claims them.
   Relations with Britain were cut after Argentina invaded the
islands in April 1982. Argentina surrendered after 74 days of
fighting that killed about 1,200 people.
   Relations thawed only after Menem's inauguration in July 1989.
He proposed that the question of who rules the islands be set aside
for the immediate future.

<HEAD>Communist Hero Removed From Bulgarian Mausoleum, Cremated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The remains of former Bulgarian leader
Georgi Dimitrov, revered as national hero during Communist rule,
have been removed from a downtown mausoleum and cremated, the state
news agency BTA reported.
   It said Wednesday that the cremation took place in the presence
of relatives, suggesting the procedure took place overnight to
avoid publicity.
   Despite longtime official veneration, Dimitrov has become
increasingly unpopular, particularly in Sofia, where the
non-communist opposition Union of Democratic Forces emerged as
clear winner in last month's multiparty elections.
   The mausoleum that had held Dimitrov's remains has been guarded
around the clock by two soldiers in traditional Balkan-style dress
uniform, equipped with bayonet-topped rifles.
   A leading figure in the international Communist movement,
Dimitrov was acquitted in a trial in late 1933 in which he was
charged with complicity in the fire that destroyed the German
Reichstag (Parliament) building.
   Historians say the arson was a Nazi provocation.
   In 1946, Dimitrov became leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party
and also headed the government until his death in 1949.
   Under Dimitrov, non-Communist opposition parties were either
disbanded or merged in a Communist-dominated mass organization.

<HEAD>Moscow Decision on Germany Will Boost Arms Control Talks: Experts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moscow's decision to drop its objection to
NATO membership for a reunited Germany likely will put East-West
arms control negotiations back on track, administration officials
and private arms control experts say.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters Wednesday that
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's concession on German
participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ``removed
the last roadblock'' to clinching two landmark arms control
agreements.
   Cheney referred to 23-nation negotiations to sharply reduce the
number of conventional arms _ tanks, troops and aircraft _ in
Europe, and to U.S.-Soviet talks on slashing strategic, or
long-range, nuclear missiles by one-third.
   The conventional arms negotiations have been bogged down for
months by several key disputes, including NATO resistance to a
Soviet demand that the West German government of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl accept a numerical limit on its armed forces.
   Kohl had said his country must not be singled out for such
limits. But at his summit with Gorbachev on Monday, Kohl agreed
that a united Germany would have no more than 370,000 troops in its
army, 45 percent fewer than the present combined strength of the
East and West Germany's armed forces.
   In return, Gorbachev withdrew his objections to permitting a
united Germany in NATO, whose leaders pledged at a meeting in
London on July 6 to relax their military readiness and reduce their
reliance on nuclear arms.
   Settlement of the German troop strength question is likely to
give new life to the East-West conventional arms negotiations under
way in Vienna, arms control analysts said Wednesday.
   ``It definitely helps,'' said David Shorr, associate director of
the British American Security Information Council, a research group
based in Washington and London.
   Shorr said the Kohl-Gorbachev deal made it increasingly likely
that the Vienna negotiators will meet their unofficial deadline of
completing a treaty in time for a 35-nation summit to be held in
Paris on Nov. 19 to ratify a new political relationship among the
United States, the Soviet Union, Canada and all of Europe.
   Some obstacles to a conventional forces agreement are yet to be
worked out. They include:
   _Whether a limit should be placed on individual nations' shares
of the total number of troops allowed in Europe.
   _Which kinds of aircraft should be counted in the military
equipment limits.
   _Under what circumstances a country would be allowed to convert
military equipment to civilian use.
   _How often each country would have to permit inspections of
conventional arms on its soil.
   The Kohl-Gorbachev agreement appeared to have little direct
application to the U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Reduction Talks to
reduce long-range nuclear missile arsenals, although Cheney
mentioned START in saying arms agreements were now more likely.
   Cheney did not elaborate on this point, but analysts said they
believed resolution of the last remaining major political obstacle
to German reunification would make it easier for Washington and
Moscow to resolve their START disagreements.
   ``The national security bureaucracies in both countries ... have
been preoccupied with these questions of German reunification,''
said Dunbar Lockwood, who studies START issues for the private Arms
Control Association. ``Now they can start thinking about arms
control again.''
   Three major issues remain unresolved in the START talks, which
Gorbachev and President Bush have said they hope to complete by the
end of this year. The stickiest issue is how far the Soviets will
be allowed to go in modernizing their SS-18 intercontinental
ballistic missiles, which form the backbone of the Soviet nuclear
arsenal.
   The two other unresolved matters are limits on the Soviet
Backfire bomber and Soviet efforts to restrict U.S. sales of
strategic nuclear systems to Britain.

<HEAD>Convicted Spy Jonathan Pollard Serves Wife With Divorce Papers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted spy Jonathan Pollard served his wife
with divorce papers Wednesday at the hospital where she is being
treated for a gastrointestinal disorder, Mrs. Pollard's attorney
said.
   In seeking the divorce, Jonathan Pollard cited ``irreconcilable
differences'' and the fact that he has not lived with his wife
since his arrest in November 1985, said Mark Baker, attorney for
Anne Henderson Pollard.
   Pollard, a 36-year old former Navy analyst, was sentenced to
life in prison in June 1987 after he pleaded guilty to providing
Israel with documents about the military strengths of countries in
the Middle East.
   Mrs. Pollard, 30, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to receive
embezzled government property and being an accessory to possession
of national defense documents.
   She was sentenced to five years in prison and was released this
year after serving 40 months. Pollard is serving time in a maximum
security federal prison in Marion, Ill. He is in solitary
confinement and knows only what his father and sister tell him
about his wife's actions, Baker said.
   Mrs. Pollard has worked to secure her husband's freedom since
her release, including trying to get the Israeli prime minister to
intervene on Pollard's behalf.
   In a news release, Mrs. Pollard said she believed her husband's
action Wednesday was the result of five years of solitary
confinement, manipulation by his parents, his sister and political
forces.
   ``I am deeply grieved by this action as I had hoped to have
children,'' she said.
   Her husband's Washington lawyer, Judith Barnett, denied that
relatives influenced his decision.
   ``This 100 percent Jonathan's action,'' she told The Washington
Post.
   The couple lived together for ``several years'' before being
married in August 1985, said Baker. They were together as a married
couple for just three months before they were arrested in November,
and haven't seen each other since they were sentenced more than
four years ago, Baker said.
   Mrs. Pollard spent a good portion of her jail term in prison
hospitals undergoing treatment for the gastrointestinal ailment.
She is currently being treated at Mount Sinai Hospital but hopes to
leave for an Israeli hospital where she can receive treatment at no
cost, her attorney said.
   The attorney said the divorce papers were served on Mrs. Pollard
by a process server disguised as a hospital employee.

<HEAD>Impossible for Gorbachev to Block NATO Membership For Germany

<TEXT>
   The collapse of pro-Soviet regimes in Eastern
Europe and the impending union of the two Germanys gave President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev little choice but to abandon his opposition to
the new Germany's membership in NATO.
   ``I don't think he had any bargaining chips left, once East
Germany collapsed,'' said Adam Ulam, a professor at Harvard
University. ``It was obvious that he would have to accept anything
that was offered.
   What West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl offered was $3 billion
in credits to ease an increasingly desperate Soviet debt problem,
plus continued German support for Western aid to the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev's about-face on the issue of German membership in NATO
also came after he won promises that Germany would cut its armed
forces and that the Atlantic alliance would adjust its policies to
the shrinking Soviet threat.
   ``We got what we wanted, too. It was a step-by-step process,
with concessions on both sides,'' a senior Soviet diplomat said.
   A senior Western diplomat, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said ``Gorbachev got what he needed in London, and from
Kohl.''
   Both diplomats were referring to statement issued after a recent
North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in London that the
Western alliance was shifting from a military to a political
alliance, as requested by the Kremlin, and to an agreement by Kohl
to reduce the German armed forces.
   Soviet media, however, still have not reported in detail
Gorbachev's meeting with Kohl on Monday, when the Soviet leader
dropped months of ardent opposition to German membership in NATO.
   The Soviet Union lost 20 million people during World War II, and
memories of the Nazi invasion still are bitter.
   In his meeting with Gorbachev, Kohl agreed that in the next
three or four years the united German army will be cut to 370,000
troops. The two Germanys now have about 600,000 men under arms,
480,000 of them in the West.
   Kohl and Gorbachev also agreed:
   _ To begin negotiations on the complete withdrawal of Soviet
soldiers from what is now East Germany. The approximately 380,000
soldiers should be withdrawn in three to four years, they said.
   _ That no NATO forces will be stationed in what is now East
Germany as long as Soviet forces are there. German soldiers not
integrated into the NATO command may be stationed there as soon as
unification is completed.
   _ The rights of the four victorious World War II powers _
France, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union _ will
cease immediately upon unification. But Western forces may remain
in Berlin as long as Soviet soldiers stay in any part of the
country.
   Poland, which had sought guarantees that Germany would not seek
to regain land that once was German but has been Polish since the
war, this week said it was satisified with the arrangement.
   Ulam, reached by telephone in Cambridge, Mass., said he would
``be surprised if the Soviets did not have their forces out of
Germany within a year,'' shortly after the expected unification of
Germany.
   Most Soviet troops in Eastern Europe are stationed in East
Germany and have been in a precarious position since the Communist
government in Poland fell and the hard-line East German regime
collapsed last year.
   The Soviet Union, where people can wait a decade or more for
housing, will have a difficult time absorbing the returning
soldiers and their families.
   Kohl has agreed to foot part of the bill for keeping Soviet
troops in East Germany, Moscow-based diplomats said, but pressure
is expected to mount to use the money for the civilian economy.
   Kohl, along with President Francois Mitterrand of France, also
has been pushing for Western aid to support Gorbachev's reform
efforts.
   President Bush has balked at the French and German proposal,
urging the allies to wait until the Soviets move more decisively
from a planned to a market economy.
   Western diplomats in Moscow say Bush wants the International
Monetary Fund to impose on the Soviets the same type of stringent
economic conditions it would on needy developing nations.
   ``That way, it would be an economic condition, and not a
political condition,'' said a Western diplomat.
   Gorbachev might find that formula convenient, as well.
   ``He has given in on almost everything,'' said Ulam. ``His
political skills are great, but they consist largely of being able
to swim with the current.''

   The Senate Ethics Committee is calling on the
full Senate to denounce Sen. Dave Durenberger, who is agreeing to
pay up to $124,000 in restitution for his financial misconduct.
   The Minnesota Republican said he would repay the money as a
``tangible sign of my regret.''
   The committee unanimously approved a resolution Wednesday saying
that Durenberger ``knowingly and willingly'' violated Senate rules
through financial dealings that were ``unequivocally unethical.''
   Leaders of the Senate say they hope to put the recommendations
to a vote by the time Congress leaves for its August recess.
   Senate historians say that denouncing or censuring a colleague
is the most serious disciplinary action senators can take short of
expulsion.
   The committee said Durenberger should reimburse the Senate
$29,050 plus interest for improper payments on his Minneapolis
condominium and give to charity about $95,000 that he collected in
excess speaking fees. That amount would be reduced by whatever
taxes he has already paid on the income.
   Durenberger has incurred more than $500,000 in legal fees.
   The panel referred its findings, without making any
recommendations, to Senate Republicans, who could strip Durenberger
of any positions of party responsibility.
   The findings also will go to federal agencies, including the
Justice Department and Federal Election Commission.
   ``Of all the thousands of words that have been written or spoken
during 23 months of investigation, news coverage and commentary,
only three are appropriate today: I am sorry,'' Durenberger said in
a brief statement after committee leaders announced their
recommendation.
   ``I accept the committee's direction to make restitution as a
tangible sign of my regret and continuing commitment to the people
of Minnesota,'' he said.
   Durenberger's popularity has plummeted in Minnesota, according
to opinion polls, but he has said he will not resign. He does not
face re-election until 1994.
   State Democratic Chairman Todd Otis called on Durenberger to
resign, saying he had ``brought a black cloud to Minnesota
politics.''
   The Ethics Committee found the following violations, which it
said ``brought the Senate into dishonor and disrepute'':
   _A book contract with Piranha Press that Durenberger used to
collect $100,000 in speaking fees over the Senate's limits on
honoraria.
   _Real estate transactions involving his Minneapolis condominium
so he could obtain reimbursement from the Senate for staying there.
   _His failure to report the receipt of travel expenses in
connection with his book-promotion appearances and trips to the
Boston area, where he made speeches to coincide with visits to his
marriage counselor.
   _His discussions about the condominium with the trustee of his
blind trust.
   _Acceptance of free limousine service in violation of Senate
gift limits.
   _Conversion of a $5,000 campaign contribution to personal use.
   The committee's vice chairman, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., told
reporters that the panel found a pattern of misconduct in his book
and condominium deals. ``Taken in their totality, the committee
decided unanimously that they merited, regretfully, this severe
punishment,'' Rudman said.
   Although the matters were referred to the FEC and Justice
Department, Rudman said there was ``no finding of criminality
anywhere in the report.''
   Rudman and committee Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala., said they
intentionally did not recommend any specific action to Republican
senators.
   ``That is not a proper matter for the Ethics Committee. That is
a Republican Party matter,'' Rudman said. ``They can read. They can
look at the sanction.''
   The committee's report should go to the Senate in seven to 10
days.
   The panel still has before it a series of loans that Durenberger
received from a St. Paul, Minn., bank at favorable terms during the
1980s, but Rudman said he did not expect the panel to pursue the
matter.
   The committee has been embroiled in a dispute with the Minnesota
Commerce Department over records of an investigation of the
Commercial State Bank. Durenberger and bank officials have denied
he received special treatment.

<HEAD>Vitamin A Effective Treatment for Severe Measles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All children with severe measles should take
vitamin A supplements to sharply reduce the risk of complications
and death, a study published today concludes.
   Measles kills about 2 million children worldwide each year and
leaves many more blind or afflicted with lung disease.
   The research conducted in South Africa found that the vitamin
reduced the death rate by more than half and the duration of
pneumonia, diarrhea and hospitalization by about one-third.
   The results ``indicate a remarkable protective effect of vitamin
A in severe measles,'' the doctors wrote.
   Earlier research has turned up circumstantial evidence that the
vitamin helps. As a result, the World Health Organization three
years ago recommended that young measles victims take vitamin
supplements anywhere that vitamin A deficiency is common or that
more than 1 percent of measles cases are fatal.
   The study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine
was conducted by Drs. Gregory D. Hussey and Max Klein of the
University of Cape Town.
   The study randomly assigned 120 milligrams of vitamin A or
identical-looking placeboes to 189 children who were hospitalized
because of measles complicated by pneumonia, diarrhea or croup.
   Of the 12 children who died, 10 were taking placeboes.
   ``All children with severe measles should be given vitamin A
supplements, whether or not they are thought to have a nutritional
deficiency,'' the doctors wrote.

<HEAD>Man Says AWOL Soldiers Trying to Go to Heaven</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GULF BREEZE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six soldiers who left their Army
intelligence post in West Germany told a man who sold them a van
that they were Christian fundamentalists who believed their road to
heaven led through a Florida beach.
   ``They believed the Rapture was going to happen in Pensacola
Beach in October,'' William Grant of Morristown, Tenn., told the
Pensacola News Journal in an interview published Wednesday.
   Many fundamentalist Christians predicte believers will be swept
to heaven seven years before the end of the world in the Rapture.
   The five men and a woman, members of the 701st Military
Intelligence Brigade at Augsburg, West Germany, were arrested in
this Pensacola suburb over the weekend. They are being held at Fort
Benning, Ga., pending a counterintelligence investigation.
   All six held top-secret security clearances and were
intelligence analysts assigned to intercepting, identifying and
exploiting foreign communications, Padilla said.
   Maj. Joe Padilla, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon, Wednesday
retracted an earlier statement that the six were members of a group
known as ``The End of the World.''
   ``There is no group as far as we can tell,'' Padilla said.
   The term ``End of the World'' was written on doodles found in
the room of one of the soldiers in Germany, Padilla said. He said
he didn't know why they left Germany or anything about their
religious beliefs.
   Said Grant: ``I don't want to talk down to anyone about anyone
else's religious beliefs, but they said if they weren't on the
beach in Pensacola they wouldn't go to heaven.''
   He said he sold the them a van July 7 in Morristown, near
Jefferson City, the hometown of one of the soldiers, Specialist
Kenneth Beason, 26.
   Gulf Breeze police stopped the van and its driver, Pfc. Michael
Huckstaedt, 19 of Farson, Wyo., because the taillights weren't
working. A computer records checked showed that he and the other
five were wanted by military authorities.
   Gulf Breeze police identified the others as Pfc. Kris Perlock,
20, of Osceola, Wis.; Pfc. William Setterberg, 20, of Pittsburgh;
Specialist Vance Davis, 25, of Valley Center, Kan., and Sgt.
Annette Eccleston, 22, whose hometown was unknown.
   The Army has yet to file any charges against the six, but
Padilla said he doubted they would be going back to their unit in
Germany. He said they are accused of being absent without
authorization which could lead to formal charges of being absent
without leave or desertion.
   All six held top-secret security clearances and were
intelligence analysts assigned to intercepting, identifying and
exploiting foreign communications, Padilla said.

   Non-polluting, 300-mile-an-hour magnetic
levitating trains could be whisking passengers between some U.S.
cities before the end of the 1990s, the federal railroad
administrator predicts.
   The country may be entering a new era in ground transportation,
with projects already beginning in California, Nevada and Florida,
said Gilbert E. Carmichael, who heads the Federal Railroad
Administration.
   Several other areas also are looking into magnetic levitation or
high-speed rail, he said.
   Carmichael, in an interview Wednesday, discussed an FRA report
completed this week that said magnetically levitated trains are
feasible for the United States, even without significant federal
funding.
   No magnetic train yet carries paying passengers anywhere in the
world, but Carmichael said he recently rode on a 19-mile test
system in West Germany.
   ``You feel it levitate, and then you feel it swoosh you along
without any vibration,'' Carmichael said. ``Cows were grazing
underneath when we passed over, and they didn't even look up.''
   Because the trains float on a powerful magnetic field, there is
no friction or wear and far less energy is consumed. It takes about
as much electricity to run the German system as to air-condition
it, Carmichael said.
   Fares would be about 20 percent below air fares and, on some
shorter routes, 40 percent lower, the administrator said.
   The report said the United States _ which started and then
abandoned the ``maglev'' technology two decades ago _ still could
create a better system than those being tested in West Germany and
Japan. The system is intended as an alternative to short-distance
air travel.
   Carmichael said he expects at least two maglev routes to be in
operation before the end of the decade, along with two or three
high-speed rail systems.
   But he said the decision must be made whether to invest $1
billion to develop a new U.S. system, to get into a joint venture
with a foreign system that already is well along or simply to buy
either the German or Japanese products.
   Maglev technologies are in competition with high-speed rail,
which is a fast steel-on-steel system, and with Swedish tilting
trains that allow faster service on existing tracks without
passengers feeling the curves.
   Carmichael said all of the systems can be used, along with
tilt-rotor aircraft, in a multi-modal approach to preventing
transportation gridlock next century.
   The FRA study said any heavily traveled route of 100 to 500
miles holds potential for the magnetic system.
   A system of up to 2,600 miles could be built for about $55
billion with tax-free bonds and no public financing, assuming
rights-of-way are available at little or no cost, the report said.
   An advisory panel to the Senate Committee on Environment and
Public Works recommended a year ago that the government allocate
$750 million over six years to develop, test and demonstrate
several maglev routes.
   The federal budget so far calls for only $12 million to further
study the potential for high-speed trains.
   But there are signs of growing support from industry.
   On Monday, a partnership headed by Bechtel International Inc. of
San Francisco put up $500,000 for the right to bid on a $5 billion
maglev train between Southern California and Las Vegas. Planners
hope to have the train running in seven years.
   Business and government leaders in Pittsburgh are moving to make
the city a technological and manufacturing base for the
German-developed maglev system, while developing a 19-mile
demonstration run between downtown Pittsburgh and the city's
international airport.
   Another privately funded project in Florida is planning to build
a 14-mile German system by 1994 to link Orlando Airport to Disney
World and other nearby resorts.
   Carmichael said at least two companies are bidding to develop a
high-speed rail system in Texas to link Houston and Dallas.
   The FRA's report envisions five maglev systems that eventually
could be tied together.
   They include a giant web in the Northeast running from Boston to
Richmond, Va., and going as far west as Minneapolis and St. Louis.
   In the South, the floating trains would zip from Nashville down
to Miami and from Charlotte across to Birmingham.
   The California-Nevada system eventually would link Reno,
Sacramento, San Francisco and San Diego to the already planned Los
Angeles-Las Vegas line.
   A Northwest system would tie Portland to Seattle, and the
Dallas-Houston line would connect to San Antonio and Austin.

   President Bush's decision to end recognition
of rebels battling Cambodia's Vietnamese-backed government _ and
open talks with Vietnam instead _ is being welcomed in Congress,
but some lawmakers say it doesn't go far enough.
   ``U.S. policy requires overhaul and intensive effort, not
tinkering and fleeting attention,'' Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, said Wednesday. He called past policy ``a dismal
failure.''
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, called for an end to covert U.S. aid to Cambodia's rebel
coalition.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced Wednesday in
Paris that the United States would withdraw its support for the
three-party coalition that is fighting the Vietnamese-installed
Phnom Penh government.
   That coalition includes the Khmer Rouge, which was responsible
for more than 1 million deaths during its reign in Cambodia in the
1970s.
   Baker also said the United States would begin a dialogue with
Vietnam about the need for a political solution to Cambodia's civil
war, and would allow U.S.-sponsored humanitarian programs _
including $5 million in aid for children _ to go forward inside
Cambodia.
   The moves were seen as adjustments to a new reality in Cambodia,
where a potential takeover by the brutal Khmer Rouge has become a
larger worry than fears of encroachment by neighboring communist
Vietnam.
   But in a letter to Mitchell, Baker also said ``it is more
important than ever to provide U.S. materiel support for the
non-communist resistance, who should not be undercut just as they
seek to provide the only non-communist alternative in free
elections.''
   The United States now provides $7 million openly to the
resistance for non-lethal supplies and an additional $13 million a
year in covert military aid for the coalition, according to
intelligence sources.
   Both payments are under attack in Congress, because while the
aid ostensibly supports the coalition faction of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, critics say it at least indirectly helps the Khmer Rouge,
which is the country's strongest military force.
   Several opponents of U.S. policy said continuing the aid was
inconsistent with other moves by the administration.
   ``The administration has eliminated the rationale for their
policy of support for the non-communist resistance, but on the
other hand has increased its resolve to provide assistance. That's
a contradiction,'' said Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass.
   Citing reports that the Khmer Rouge is gaining ground on the
battlefield, Mitchell said: ``There is simply no excuse to delay
additional action'' that would go beyond Baker's announcement.
   Among actions Mitchell sought was direct U.S. talks with the
Phnom Penh government of Hun Sen, rather than his Vietnamese
sponsors in Hanoi, who are in turn supported by the Soviet Union.
   And he said Bush should be more willing to apply pressure to
China, the chief supporter of the Khmer Rouge, and to do so
publicly. ``The Chinese leadership must be made to understand that
it stands entirely alone in support of genocidal forces,'' he said.
   Boren did not directly refer to the covert military aid program
that goes through his Intelligence Committee, but he said that all
U.S. support for the resistance should be handled openly.
   ``Any future debate on our policy toward Cambodia should be in
the Foreign Relations Committee, not in the Intelligence
Committee,'' which meets behind closed doors, Boren said.
   The intelligence panel voted June 28 to cut off the covert aid
program beginning Oct. 1.
   Boren said he assumed the policy shift is ``a signal that the
administration would no longer be seeking any aid that could be
even indirectly helpful to the Khmer Rouge.'' That will require the
administration to shift its budget request to support humanitarian
programs and democracy-building moves, he said.
   Under U.S. pressure, the United Nations has awarded a seat to
the Cambodian resistance coalition and denied formal recognition to
Hun Sen.
   Baker said the United States also was changing its policy toward
the Cambodian U.N. seat.

   American voters are concerned about children's
issues and would be willing to support candidates and increased
funding of programs to help them, according to a survey released
today.
   However, the study said that translating voter concern into
action has been lacking because ``public knowledge has yet to catch
up to the reality of children's lives.''
   A better-informed public ``may provide greater political
momentum for enhanced public programs for children,'' said the
study titled, ``Kids' Clout: Americans' Attitudes on Children's
Issues.''
   The study, published by the National Association of Children's
Hospitals and Related Institutions, discusses how concern for
children can influence voting behavior.
   The association found 60 percent of Americans believe the
quality of children's lives ``has become worse over the past five
years _ and more than one American in four believes that it has
become much worse.''
   Sixty-nine percent or two-thirds recognized that 20 percent or
more children have no health insurance. But only 11 percent could
differentiate Medicaid from Medicare as the government health
program that serves poor children.
   However, when the confusion was cleared up, ``support for this
program (Medicaid) ranks near the top of many Americans' spending
priorities'' with 58 percent ranking it at 6 or higher on a scale
of one to 10, with 10 being the highest priority.
   The study showed Americans also would be willing to pay
increased taxes to pay for health insurance for poor children.
   ``A majority, 59 percent, would be willing to have their taxes
raised the $100 per year it is estimated to cost to give all poor
children health insurance,'' said the study.
   Further, 67 percent said they ``would be more likely to vote for
a candidate who supported increased spending for children's
programs, even if it meant an increase in their taxes.''
   Both men and women favored more overall spending on children's
programs but parents are more likely than non-parents to support
increased spending on children's health.
   The study was the result of a June 9-17 telephone survey of
1,000 adults commissioned by the association. The margin of error
was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

<HEAD>German Unification Will Affect U.S. Farm Exports</HEAD>

   The rejoining of East and West Germany will
mean some changes for U.S. agricultural exporters, an Agriculture
Department trade expert says.
   East Germany has imported up to one-fourth of its annual grain
needs, said Steven Yoder of the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service. Part of that has been U.S. corn and durum wheat for pasta,
and sometimes some oilseeds.
   But when East Germany is united with West Germany and becomes a
part of the European Economic Community, ``we're likely to lose
those grain markets _ regardless of what happens to East German
grain production,'' Yoder said.
   Yoder recently visited both East and West Germany for a
firsthand look at farm production and markets. He was U.S.
agricultural attache in East Germany during 1980-84.
   ``The other thing we've got to do is establish a strong presence
for U.S. farm and food products in the East German marketplace
before our competitors get it all sewn up,'' he said.
   Yoder said traders from West Germany and other Western European
countries ``are moving into the market in a big way with consumer
food products.''
   The West Germans, or course, have a language bond with the East,
Yoder noted. Some have lived in East Germany and can go back to
renew contacts.
   ``Sure, the market is not without risk,'' Yoder said. ``There
are no guarantees in such an unsettled situation. However, there
are a lot of opportunities up for grabs, too.''
   The main thing, he added, is that U.S. traders ``can't sit back
and wait for everything relating to new-to-market food products to
jell.''
   Yoder's remarks were in the forthcoming August issue of
AgExporter magazine published by the USDA agency.
   According to department export records, about $74.5 million
worth of U.S. agricultural commodities, mostly grain, were exported
to East Germany in calendar 1989. Sales to West Germany, by
comparison, were about $1 billion.
   Yoder noted that East Germany is a small country with about 16
million people, but ``has many needs.'' West Germany's population
is around 61 million.
   ``For example,'' he said, ``the East German diet has always been
largely a meat-and-potatoes-and-bread affair. Milk and milk
products, including cheese, also are available, although not up to
the quality expected in the West.
   ``But supplies of fruits and vegetables are much less than
desired. And there's a wide-open market for high-value processed
products ranging from ketchup to ice cream.''

   Exports of U.S. farm products declined
seasonally in May to an estimated $3.26 billion but were still
running ahead of a year earlier, according to Agriculture
Department analysts.
   The May export estimate, which was down $145 million from April,
dropped as the result of lower values for dairy products, wheat,
rice, grain sorghum, animal feeds, soybeans and cotton.
   A monthly report by the department's Economic Research Service
said Wednesday that those declines more than offset increases in
May for corn, barley, live animals, meat, vegetable oils and
horticultural products.
   For the first eight months of the fiscal year that began last
Oct. 1, however, export values totaled about $28.5 billion, up 2
percent from the comparable period in 1988-89.
   Corn exports in May rose to 5.4 million metric tons valued at
$667 million. The Soviet Union was the largest market, taking
almost 1.5 million tons, with Japan second at 1.2 million tons.
   Other major corn markets in May included Mexico, South Korea and
Taiwan.
   Wheat exports dropped for the second consecutive month to 1.9
million tons valued at about $294 million. Shipments to the Soviet
Union declined sharply to 288,000 tons, ranking third behind China
and Japan.
   Soybean exports in May plummeted 48 percent in volume from April
to 621,000 tons valued at $148 million. That was the lowest monthly
volume since last September, but officials said soybean shipments
``generally drop off in the second half of the fiscal year.''
   Cotton shipments fell 20 percent in May to 128,000 tons,
following a 26 percent drop in April, the report said. However, the
export value increased to $1,628 per ton from $1,573 in April.
   The increase in the average cotton price was attributed to
increased exports of higher-priced long-staple Pima cotton.
   ``Declining shipments to China, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and
the (European Economic Community) more than offset increases to
Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Egypt,'' the report said.

   Vegetable farmers are boosting production this
summer, including both fresh market and processing crops, the
Agriculture Department reports.
   The prospective acreage for seven selected fresh market
vegetables in the summer season was estimated at 271,000 acres, up
4 percent from a year ago.
   Increases were reported Wednesday for carrots, celery, sweet
corn, head lettuce and tomatoes. Decreases from a year ago were
indicated for cauliflower, while broccoli was about the same.
   Plantings for the major vegetable crops for processing were
estimated at 1.63 million acres, up 8 percent from last summer.
   Increases were indicated for sweet corn, cucumbers for pickles,
green peas and tomatoes. The acreage for snap beans was reported
down from a year ago.

<HEAD>INS Changing System for Granting Asylum to Foreigners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is changing the system for
granting asylum to foreigners, a move that might increase the
number of requests it approves and remove political bias from the
procedure.
   ``The regulations ... will ensure that those who seek the
protection of this country encounter a fair and sensitive legal
process,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in announcing the
reform on Wednesday.
   Foreigners seeking asylum in the United States must be able to
prove that, if they are returned to their homeland, they are likely
to face persecution based on their political views, their race or
religion.
   Asylum requests currently are handled at Immigration and
Naturalization Service district offices by examiners who handle
many kinds of immigration and visa applications. Under the new
policy, effective Oct. 1, asylum requests will be handled by
specialists in Washington.
   The INS will designate 70 to 90 examiners who will be trained in
international law and in conditions existing around the world so
they may better decide upon asylum requests, Commissioner Gene
McNary said at a news conference.
   He said the INS also will open a documentation center that will
have updated reports on conditions in various countries for
examiners to use as reference.
   Supporters of the change say that by having its own
documentation center, the INS will rely less on the State
Department and thus may increase the number of asylum requests it
approves.
   ``The State Department has infused the asylum process with
foreign policy considerations, and the INS has been unable to rise
above its law enforcement ethos in order to examine the claims
fairly,'' said Arthur C. Helton, head of the refugee project of the
Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights.
   The documentation center will draw on information about
political conditions in foreign countries from a variety of
sources, including Amnesty International and other human rights
groups, Helton said.
   The new procedures probably will mean more asylum applications
will be approved, he predicted.
   McNary said the number of asylum requests had increased from
19,000 in 1986 to a projected 65,000 for 1990. Of those requests,
28 percent are approved on the average every year, he said.
   About 85 percent of those seeking asylum in the United States
are from Latin America. Most of the remainder are from Asia and
Ireland.
   McNary said the INS did not know if the new system would
increase or lower the approval rate. ``It will be a more accurate
adjudication,'' he said.
   The system will cost between $7 million and $9 million a year
and will be paid for mostly from fees the INS collects on various
applications.

<HEAD>Brando's Daughter Accused in Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAPEETE, French Polynesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marlon Brando's daughter, who
fled to the South Pacific after refusing to testify against her
brother in the murder of her 26-year-old boyfriend, has been
charged with conspiracy in the killing.
   The victim, Dag Drollet, was shot to death May 16 at the actor's
estate in the Santa Monica mountains near Los Angeles. The actor's
son, 32-year-old Christian, is charged with the murder.
   Brando's 20-year-old daughter, Tarita Cheyenne, went to French
Polynesia after refusing to testify against her brother, according
to Deputy District Attorney Steven Barshop of Los Angeles.
   It was not immediately clear whether she would be extradited to
the United States.
   Tarita Cheyenne Brando, a native of these South Pacific islands,
is the daughter of Brando and his current wife, Tarita Teriipia,
the Tahitian actress who played his love interest in the 1962
remake of ``Mutiny on the Bounty.'' Judge Max Catti on Tuesday
accepted the charge of conspiracy against Brando's daughter, acting
at the request of a lawyer for the victim's family. She was ordered
not to leave French Polynesia.
   Barshop, who is prosecuting the case against Christian Brando,
told a California judge on June 25 that he would attempt to
introduce statements by Miss Brando as evidence against her
half-brother in a hearing later this month. He said the statements
were made in a June 12 interview with police.
   Miss Brando returned to French Polynesia eight months pregnant
with the child of her slain boyfriend. She was in a Papeete
hospital undergoing treatment for nervous exhaustion.
   Her father maintains a home in Tahiti. The actor was home at the
time of the slaying, but he was elsewhere in the house and did not
see it. His son reportedly told police that Drollet died during a
struggle over a gun.
   Christian is the son of the actor and his first wife, Anna
Kashfi. The couple was divorced in 1960. Their son was the subject
of a bitter custody battle.

   Savings and loan defaulters could no longer
protect their assets from government seizure by transferring them
to a spouse or filing for bankruptcy, under a proposal by House
Democrats.
   Unveiling the latest package in a flurry of proposals to answer
mounting public discontent over the need for new taxes to address
S&amp;L losses, Democratic leaders said Wednesday they also want a
bipartisan commission to search out the root causes of the crisis.
   They said their legislation would target people like Bill L.
Walters, a former business associate of President Bush's son, Neil.
Walters defaulted on $106 million in S&amp;L loans and then purchased a
$1.9 million home in Newport Bay, Calif., through a trust in his
wife's name.
   ``There are no laws on the books that prevent that son of a gun
from leading a fat life while the taxpayers are spending hundreds
and hundreds of thousands of dollars because he got the money,''
said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., the author of the new proposal.
   Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Schumer's package would
be included in an anti-crime bill he plans to bring to the House
floor next week.
   Meanwhile, the Resolution Trust Corp. established by Congress
last year to manage the thrift bailout, said it has referred about
half of the 454 S&amp;Ls seized by the government to the Justice
Department for suspected criminal misconduct.
   James Dudine, the RTC's chief investigator, said Wednesday his
agency estimates that 80 percent of those cases involve fraud and
insider dealing and warrant ``major criminal investigations.''
   Walters, according to government records, defaulted on a total
of $106 million in six loans from the collapsed Silverado Banking,
Savings and Loan Association of Denver.
   As a director of Silverado, Neil Bush voted to approve all of
the loans to Walters after Walters invested $150,000 in Bush's oil
exploration company and extended a $1.75 million line of credit to
the president's son. Bush has denied any impropriety.
   The 12-member bipartisan study commission proposed by House
Democrats would be structured along the lines of the Kerner
Commission established after inner city riots in Detroit, Los
Angeles, Washington, New York and other cities in 1968.
   While the Justice Department has opposed an independent
commission, Schumer voiced optimism that the administration might
go along with the idea to defuse the current wave of election-year
sniping by Democrats and Republicans blaming each other for the S&amp;L
crisis.
   ``People want answers and the atmosphere in Congress has gotten
kind of rancorous,'' he said. ``A commission could look into it and
really get the answers to what happened. This is a big enough
crisis _ like civil rights and the problems of the inner cities
were _ to deserve that kind of thing.''
   The Democratic bill also would make the concealment of an S&amp;L's
assets a federal offense and rewrite tax laws so that a defendant
in a civil suit could not write off court-ordered restitutions as
an income tax deduction. And it would prohibit banking executives
from giving themselves so-called ``golden parachutes'' when they
leave or change their jobs.
   The Senate toughened S&amp;L sanctions as part of a crime bill it
passed last week. It voted to establish lifetime sentences for
``S&amp;L kingpins'' convicted of fraud in cases where the government
is left covering millions of dollars in losses of federally insured
deposits.
   The House bill creates new criminal offenses for concealing
assets from government regulators or obstructing their
investigations but leaves untouched the current maximum sentence of
30 years for S&amp;L fraud.
   ``We tried to be as tough as possible without going off the deep
end just for show,'' said Schumer, predicting the package will win
strong bipartisan support.

<HEAD>Scientists Tracking Down Gene That Determines People's Sex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists are closing in on the tiny bit of
genetic code that makes a man a man and a woman a woman.
   In a report published today, a British team announced the
discovery of a gene they call ``sex-determining region Y'' and said
it may be the long-sought sex trigger.
   If biology works the way many scientists believe, a single gene
rules sexual development in the womb. When an embryo inherits this
gene from its parents, it grows to be a boy. When it doesn't, it
becomes a girl.
   The search for this gene has been the subject of intense
international competition between scientists. A team from the
Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London took the latest step.
   But their chief rival, a group from the Whitehead Institute in
Cambridge, Mass., speculates that two or more genes lie at the
heart of the differences between the sexes.
   In 1987, Whitehead's Dr. David Page announced the discovery of a
gene he called ZFY. He and many others believed it probably was the
sex trigger. But last December, the London group proved that ZFY
was not the crucial gene _ at least not by itself.
   In the British journal Nature, the London team said today their
gene, which they call SRY for short, is ``proposed to be a
candidate for the elusive testis-determining gene.''
   ``The evidence is good so far, but I wouldn't stick my neck out
until we have the rest of the data in,'' said Dr. Andrew Sinclair,
the lead author of the report.
   If Page's scenario is correct, his gene and the London group's
discovery could turn out to be partners in triggering sexual
differences. Like Page, the London group pinpointed its gene by a
process of elimination.
   Everyone is born with 46 strings of genes called chromosomes.
Two of these, called X and Y, are the sex chromosomes. Women have
two X's, while men have an X and a Y. Scientists reason that the
gene that makes men different from women must be located someplace
on the Y.
   Scientists have concentrated on apparent exceptions to the rule,
so-called XX males. To all outward appearances, these people
usually are physically normal men. But their cells contain the
double X's of women. Through a genetic mix-up, one of their X's
contains a tiny fragment of Y, enough to make them men.
   The London group narrowed the search to a narrow stretch of the
Y chromosome in which they have located one gene. They cite several
reasons to think that this is, indeed, the long-sought sex gene:
   _While men have the gene, women do not possess anything like it.
   _The gene actively makes a protein in men's sex organs but not
in other parts of the body.
   _Other kinds of male mammals have similar genes.
   _In mice, the gene is turned on at precisely the moment in
development when sexual differences appear.
   Critics of this work point out that some of the XX males who
carry just the newly discovered gene have some, but not all, male
sexual features. To be completely male, they argue that people need
at least one more gene, perhaps Page's ZFY.
   ``This is a very important piece of work. There is no doubt
about that,'' Page said. ``It's just a question of whether we
really know the number of genes on the Y that are involved in sex
determination.''
   Adds Dr. Robert Erickson of the University of Michigan, ``My
hunch is that it takes ZFY to finish the job off.''
   Dr. Peter Goodfellow, senior scientist of the London group, said
he is open-minded about this genetics puzzle. While the critics may
be right, he said another possible explanation is that his SRY gene
is the true sex trigger, but it didn't work properly in the
partially masculinized people he studied.
   To settle the question, the London team says two more pieces of
research will be necessary. One will be to check XY females _ women
who appear genetically to be men _ to see if they are missing SRY.
The other will be to implant the gene into female mouse embryos to
see if this makes them become males.

<HEAD>Thousands Find Haven at Voice of America Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 11,000 refugees have found a haven at
the Voice of America radio station in Liberia, but despite fighting
in the area the transmitter still relays the U.S. government's
programs to Africa.
   Should the facility be damaged by fighting, VOA will lose about
40 percent of its broadcasts to Africa, especially to the eastern
and southern parts of the continent, VOA Deputy Director Robert
Coonrod said Wednesday.
   The area around the facility near the town of Careysburg, about
20 miles from the capital Monrovia, fell to the rebels last month
in fighting against the troops of President Samuel Doe.
   The station relays 20 hours of VOA programs in Swahili, English,
French and Portuguese each day. The programs are usually
transmitted by satellite to Monrovia and then by cable to
Careysburg.
   But with the recent failure of the earth station in Monrovia,
Coonrod said, the broadcasts are now sent to Careysburg by
shortwave radio from the United States.
   In recent weeks, fighting has broken out around the station
between the forces of Charles Taylor, a former government official
seeking to topple Doe, and renegades who broke away from Taylor's
army.
   Coonrod said the station has been run by 100 Liberians since the
last of the American staff was evacuated about four weeks ago.
   ``They're doing a remarkable job, keeping it going under
incredible circumstances,'' said Coonrod. ``We're amazed.''
   He said the technicians are performing basic maintenance jobs on
the transmitter, getting instructions by shortwave radio from their
boss in Monrovia, which is still under government control.
   Taylor has been sending refugees to the VOA facility because he
considers it a neutral site, and also because the station has its
own water sources that the refugees are using, Coonrod said.
   The refugees are camping out on the grounds of the station,
which is located on a 2,000-acre jungle clearing, and two Liberian
doctors are treating the ill and injured, he said.
   The VOA buildings have been secured with metal bars on the
windows, but the staff has instructions to abandon the facility and
save themselves if fighting spreads to the grounds of the facility,
Coonrod said.
   The VOA station, which started operating in 1954, is one of
several U.S. government facilities in Liberia, a country founded by
freed American slaves in the 1820s. Most official Americans have
been evacuated from Liberia since Taylor's insurgency began last
December.
   It has since escalated into a tribal conflict, pitting members
of the Gio and Mano tribes against government supporters who are
mostly Krahns and Mandingos.
   Doe took power in a violent 1980 coup that ousted the American
descendants, who historically monopolized power and discriminated
against indigenous Liberians.

<HEAD>House Panel Links Trade Benefits to Human Rights Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee is
demanding that the Beijing government improve its human rights
policies before the United States renews special trade privileges
for another year.
   However, the committee, which originates all trade legislation
in Congress, rejected an effort to withdraw the most-favored-nation
trade benefits that President Bush extended to China last month.
   Those benefits guarantee the lowest tariffs available on goods
imported into the United States.
   ``Our object ought to be to improve human rights in China, not
to cut off trade,'' Rep. Donald Pease, D-Ohio, said Wednesday in
arguing successfully for his bill, which the committee approved by
voice vote.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the committee,
supported Pease's bill. ``We are all outraged by human rights
atrocities taking place in China,'' but revoking trade benefits
would be counterproductive, he said.
   Rep. Richard Schulze, R-Pa., made several unsuccessful attempts
to toughen the bill.
   Despite the massacre of protesters in Beijing's Tianamen Square
in June 1989 and other human rights violations, ``the resolution
says `you get one more year to do a little better,''' Schulze said.
``We have said we are going to turn our backs on it, that the
almighty dollar ... is much more important.''
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., described Pease's bill as ``an
attempt to create enough common ground that the president and
Congress can stand on it together.'' Anything tougher almost
certainly would be vetoed, he said.
   In granting the trade benefit this year, Bush had to consider
only China's emigration policy and was allowed by law to waive any
concerns about it in the national interest. The bill would not
affect the designation for the next 12 months.
   Before renewing most-favored-nation status next year, the bill
would require the president to consider whether the Beijing
government has made significant progress in several areas. They
include:
   _Terminating martial law.
   _Accounting for citizens who were arrested as a result of
nonviolent expression of political beliefs during the uprising that
led to the Tianamen Square massacre.
   _Easing restrictions on freedom of the press.
   _Ceasing harassment of Chinese citizens in the United States.
   The president also would have to consider how denial of the
trade benefit would affect Hong Kong, the British crown colony that
borders China.
   Some members quarreled with the ``significant progress'' phrase
in the bill.
   ``If you shoot 1,000 people instead of 5,000, have you made
progress?'' asked Rep. Marty Russo, D-Ill.
   Bipartisan legislation in the Senate would withdraw
most-favored-nation status outright on grounds the Beijing
government continues to engage in torture, use of forced labor,
denial of emigration and suppression of domestic dissent, as well
as support of Khmer Rouge forces in Cambodia.
   Almost all nations, except developing countries, whose exports
are allowed tariff-free treatment, have been given
most-favored-nation status.
   Exceptions include Cuba and Vietnam.

<HEAD>Fujimori Names Former Center-Right Minister As His Prime Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW SCOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Alberto Fujimori has named as
his prime minister a former center-right Cabinet minister, the
strongest signal yet that he is indeed embracing the tough
market-oriented reforms he once eschewed.
   Fujimori on Wednesday night named ex-agriculture minister Juan
Carlos Hurtado Miller to be his prime minister and economics
minister.
   The president-elect, who takes over from center-left President
Alan Garcia on July 28, said Hurtado Miller would announce the rest
of the Cabinet this afternoon.
   The appointment came two days after two of Fujimori's top
economic advisers resigned. The two had supported a gradual
economic adjustment program.
   Before the June 10 election, Fujimori sharply criticized the
type of market-oriented ``economic shock therapy'' advocated by his
opponent, novelist Mario Vargas Llosa.
   But on subsequent visits to the United States and Japan to seek
loans, Fujimori was told drastic reform _ such as ending price
subsidies and selling off unprofitable state-owned industry _ was
needed in order to qualify for international credit.
   Fujimori has said one of his top priorities is to mend relations
with international lenders.
   The announcement came in a hastily called press conference held
at a Lima military base where Fujimori has been meeting with
advisers for the last week to choose a Cabinet. They've been
meeting at the base for security reasons.
   A decade-old insurgency by Maoist-inspired Shining Path rebels
has plagued a series of Peruvian administrations. Though mostly
centered in the countryside, the rebels have in the past year or so
tried to move their struggle into the capital.
   Hurtado Miller, who resigned Wednesday from the center-right
Popular Action party, is a former bank president and served as
agriculture minister under former President Fernando Belaunde Terry
from 1983 to 1985.
   Hurtado Miller, like Fujimori, is an agricultural engineer who
also holds a master's degree in economics from Iowa State
University and masters in public policy and management from Harvard.
   Fujimori said the priorities of his Cabinet ``will be centered
in the pacifying Peru, ending bureaucratic corruption, cleaning up
the economy, promoting a fair policy of economic stabilization, and
the reinsertion of Peru in the international financial community.''
   Following meetings last month with heads of the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank, he promised to dismantle populist price subsidy programs and
exchange rate controls imposed by Presdident Garcia.
   Those lending agencies cut off credit to Peru after Garcia
stopped payments on the country's $20 billion foreign debt.
   Fujimori said his Cabinet would be made of leaders representing
a broad spectrum of political parties, but he gave no indication
Wednesday night who his ministers would be.

<HEAD>GAO Says 1993 Deployment of Star Wars Would be Premature, Risky</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential decision to deploy the first
phase of the Strategic Defense Initiative in 1993 would be
``premature and fraught with high risk,'' congressional
investigators say.
   Citing design problems caused by the introduction of the
``Brilliant Pebbles'' concept of orbiting interceptors and detailed
tests that won't be completed in time, the General Accounting
Office on Wednesday recommended a delay in deployment of the
antimissile system.
   The report by Congress' watchdog agency is certain to affect
debate over the level of spending on SDI, commonly known as Star
Wars. The Senate Armed Services Committee, in approving a $289
billion fiscal 1991 defense bill, cut $1 billion from President
Bush's $4.7 billion budget request for the program.
   The House Armed Services Committee, which will craft its version
of the bill later this month, must slash a total of $24 billion
from Bush's overall budget of $307 billion to conform to House
instructions. A deep cut in SDI is expected.
   In the report, the GAO said ``Brilliant Pebbles'' had
drastically changed the system's design, leaving it in a state of
flux.
   In January, the Pentagon incorporated the ``Brilliant Pebbles''
concept into Phase 1. The technology involves several thousand
interceptors that would orbit the Earth to seek and destroy a
target by smashing into it at high speeds.
   The GAO also said that detailed tests planned by the Strategic
Defense Initiative Organization, a Defense Department agency that
oversees Star Wars, won't be completed before the scheduled
executive decision on deployment.
   Based on those problems, the GAO said it doesn't believe the SDI
organization ``will be able to give the president enough
information to support a 1993 decision to deploy Phase 1.''
   The Pentagon plans to spend between $69 billion and $87 billion
to develop and deploy the first phase of SDI, designed to protect
the United States from a Soviet nuclear ballistic missile attack.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said the goal of Phase 1 was
to destroy half the Soviet Union's SS-18 nuclear warheads _ 1,540
of the 3,080 currently deployed _ and 40 percent of its other
warheads launched in an initial strike against the United States.
   The first phase involves seven highly integrated elements: two
space-based sensors, a space-based weapon, two ground-based
sensors, a ground-based weapon and a command and control system
that would manage the other elements.
   SDI officials believe they can support a decision to deploy
Phase 1 with less information but say it will be done at increased
risk, the GAO said.
   In a statement, the SDI Organization said its goals are to
conduct ``a vigorous research and technology program'' that would
be the basis for an informed decision by the president. The agency
said it would have no official comment on the report until the GAO
formally released it in early August.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the House Government
Operations Committee, said successful deployment depends on a
``sound, stable design plan.''
   ``GAO's report shows that no such plan exists because of the
radical changes made recently by the inclusion of Brilliant Pebbles
into the design. Caution and skepticism are appropriate when
Congress looks toward funding the completion of Phase 1,'' said
Conyers, who requested the report.
   The GAO noted the absence of scrutiny the Pentagon envisioned
for the program. The Defense Acquisition Board didn't conduct its
scheduled 1989 review and has not assessed the affect of Brilliant
Pebbles on the design and tests.
   ``The lack of effective agency oversight has contributed to the
failure of other automated weapons systems, none of which matches
the scale and technological complexity of Phase 1,'' the GAO said.
   ``Consequently, any executive decision in 1993 to deploy Phase 1
would be premature and fraught with high risk.''
   The GAO recommended that Cheney advise President Bush to defer a
decision to deploy any element of the Phase 1 system until the SDI
Organization has stabilized the design and shown the system's
effectiveness through testing.

<HEAD>Study: U.S. Policy on Nuclear Waste `Bound to Fail'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A National Research Council report says a plan
for an underground dump for high-level nuclear waste is ``bound to
fail'' because it requires an assurance of safety that science
can't guarantee.
   The report said a U.S. policy requiring the Department of Energy
to build a deep underground nuclear dump that is absolutely assured
of being safe for 10,000 years is a scientific and engineering
impossibility.
   ``A policy that promises to anticipate every conceivable
problem, or assumes that science will shortly provide all the
answers, is bound to fail,'' the study said.
   It notes that the 10,000-year requirement covers a period that
is as long as all of recorded human history.
   The study said federal law should give DOE more flexibility to
allow for uncertainties found while building such a large project
that has never before been attempted.
   However, Melinda Kassen, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense
Fund, said her organization and other environmental groups believe
the standards now in place should be enforced and that a policy
demanding firm evidence of safety is the correct approach.
   ``There is wisdom, we believe, in trying to assure up front that
you're not going to have contamination or catastrophe down the
road,'' Ms. Kassen said in a telephone interview. ``Before putting
nuclear waste in the ground, you ought to show that the system is
going to work.''
   The National Research Council study said the effect of current
laws is that DOE managers feel required to do things ``perfectly
the first time.'' While preparing an underground depository for
high-level radioactive wastes, the report said, federal experts are
not given the flexibility to find ways to cope with unexpected
geological features or to incorporate new scientific knowledge.
   This rigid approach, the study said, creates a ``scientific
trap'' by ``encouraging the public to expect absolute certainty
about the safety of the repository for 10,000 years and encouraging
DOE program managers to pretend that they can provide it.''
   ``Engineers are unable to anticipate all of the potential
problems that might arise in trying to site, build and operate a
repository,'' the report said. ``Nor can science prove that a
repository will be absolutely safe.''
   The DOE has studied a number of candidate sites for underground
nuclear waste storage.
   In 1987, Congress designated a site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada
for detailed study. If the site meets standards established by the
law, it could be licensed as the first underground repository for
thousands of tons of high-level radioactive waste created annually
by nuclear power plants.
   Congress in 1982 assigned DOE to design and operate an
underground depository. The law says the site must licensed by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and meet Environmental Protection
Agency standards that limit release of radiation to levels that
would cause fewer than 1,000 deaths over 10,000 years.
   ``This perfect knowledge approach is unrealistic, given the
inherent uncertainties of this unprecedented undertaking, and it
runs the risk of encountering show-stopping problems and delays
that could lead to further deterioration of public and scientific
trust,'' the National Research Council said in its report.
   Requiring predictions of safety so far into the future, the
study said, ``stretches the limits'' of geology, groundwater
chemistry and other sciences.
   ``As a consequence, the resulting estimates are uncertain to
some degree and they will remain uncertain no matter how much
additional information is gathered,'' the report said.
   The American people, the study said, should understand such
uncertainties.
   ``The public has been told too often that absolute guarantees
can be provided, but most citizens watching the human frailties of
their governments and technologists know better,'' the report said.
``A realistic, and attainable, goal is to assure the public that
the likelihood of serious unforeseen events ... is minimal and that
the consequences of such events will be limited.''
   The National Research Council is an agency of the National
Academy of Sciences, a private organization chartered by Congress
to advise the federal government on scientific matters.

   U.S. industry will be allowed to share
technology developed in nuclear weapons laboratories as part of a
growing government-private sector partnership, Energy Secretary
James Watkins says.
   ``Without the ability to manufacture high-quality goods, America
is out of the competition,'' Watkins said as he signed two
technology-transfer agreements with business consortia on Wednesday.
   The initiatives follow enactment last year of legislation
encouraging such exchanges.
   ``Japan and a number of European countries are way ahead of us
in government encouragement of private industry,'' said Sen. Carl
Levin, D-Mich. ``These agreements will unlock technology now in the
hands of the government and ... make this country more
competitive.''
   The Energy Department's weapons program consists of 17
laboratories, production facilities and test sites in 12 states. It
has over $100 billion in assets and a yearly research and
development budget of about $3 billion.
   The program is one of a handful in government that advance
technology from the basic research stage all the way to product
application. It has generated some of the world's most
sophisticated manufacturing equipment, machine tools, control and
measurement systems and quality assurance methods, Watkins said.
   One agreement commits the Energy Department to share information
with the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, a non-profit
consortium based in Ann Arbor, Mich. It represents more than 100
companies.
   ``Taxpayers have invested $100 billion in America's national
labs and production complexes over the years, and they represent
one of the world's great treasure houses of technology and
manufacturing know-how,'' said Ed Miller, president of the center.
   Under the second agreement, a consortium of 10 companies plus
universities and the Energy Department will conduct research on
specialty metals at the Sandia National Laboratories of
Albuquerque, N.M.
   Specialty metals are combinations of metals and alloys or other
materials, such as ceramics, that are designed to meet strict
quality-control standards for highly complex products. They are
used in aircraft, satellites, nuclear-power reactors and high-speed
drills.
   The Sandia lab will give industry and university researchers
access to the only 310-kilowatt electron-beam melting furnace of
its size in the nation available for pure research.
   The agreement with the center in Ann Arbor will boost research
into advanced robotics techniques for manufacturing, pollution
cleanup technology and high-speed machine technology, Miller said.
   Some of the center's member companies already are working with
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to develop
a grade of aluminum that could ``revolutionize'' automobile
production through more precise engineering, Miller said.
   ``You're talking about multi-billion-dollar impacts to the
productivity and quality of products,'' he said. ``People with the
biggest companies in the United States _ General Motors, Ford _
have already visited the laboratories and have said they'll use
this technology if they can get access to it.''

   Authorities have arrested a fugitive student
leader of last year's crushed pro-democracy movement later set up
an underground organization to agitate for reforms, the student's
university confirmed today.
   A student source, meanwhile, said a second protest leader had
been placed in solitary confinement for trying to organize a hunger
strike among prisoners.
   An official at the Student Affairs Office of the Beijing
Economics Institute, contacted by telephone, confirmed unofficial
reports that fugitive student Zhai Weimin had been arrested and
jailed, but said she had no details. She did not give her name.
   Zhai is the fourth Beijing student known to have been arrested
without publicity in the past three months, even as the government
tries to ease foreign criticism by announcing large prisoner
releases.
   The other three were students at Beijing University suspected of
involvement in underground activities.
   The student source, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear
of official punishment, said Zhai was placed in Beijing's Qincheng
Prison for political prisoners in May.
   That was just three months after Zhai held a secret conference
in Beijing of his underground Democratic Front for the Salvation of
China. Participants in the conference told foreign journalists at
the time that more than 60 people took part.
   The front was one of several small underground groups
established across China to agitate for reform after Communist
authorities ordered an army attack on student-led demonstrators in
Beijing on June 3-4, 1989, ending seven weeks of massive
pro-democracy protests. Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed.
   Zhai, 22, from central China's Henan province, was a student at
the Beijing Economics Institute when the student protest movement
began in April 1989. He quickly became one of its leaders.
   After the army attack, the government issued a list of 21
most-wanted student protest leaders. Zhai, No. 6 on the list,
already was in hiding.
   Another protester on that list, Liu Gang, who has been jailed
since June 1989, was moved to solitary confinement at Qincheng
Prison in May, the student source said.
   He said Liu had tried to organize fellow prisoners in a hunger
strike on June 4 to commemorate the slain protesters.
   Liu, 29, had been working at a research institute when the
protests began but quickly joined the students.
   The student source also said two more fugitives on the list of
21, Wang Zhixin of the China University of Political Science and
Law, and Wang Youcai of Beijing University, were in prison. He did
not know when they were arrested.
   Both universities said they had no information on the two
students. Police have refused to comment on arrests.
   Eight students from the list of 21 were previously known to be
arrested. The arrests of Zhai and the two Wangs would bring that to
11. Two students on the list who were arrested last summer have
since been released. Five on the list have fled abroad, and the
whereabouts of five are not known.
   The government has said that 355 people who are still being
investigated remain jailed in Beijing in connection with the
pro-democracy movement.
   It has not released figures for people charged and awaiting
trial, or already tried and sentenced.
   Chinese sources say several intellectuals have received
sentences of eight to 10 years in prison.
   Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji, visiting the United States to drum up
foreign investments, said last week in Washington that fewer than
10 people are still being detained in his city in connection with
the protests.
   No figures have been issued for the rest of the country, but
thousands are known to have been arrested nationwide. The
government has announced the release of a total of 881 prisoners in
Beijing and Shanghai.
   China's policy since the winter has been to try to wrap up as
many cases as possible, releasing those it considers lesser
offenders, beginning prosecution of alleged ringleaders and sending
abroad some of the most famous dissidents _ astrophysicist Fang
Lizhi and folk singer Hou Dejian.

   In the case of Mike O'Neil, an equipment operator for the Port

   O'Neil said he couldn't see where he was going when the accident
happened Tuesday.
   ``I was dragging a large log out of the way and I had to go up
an incline in the roadway bank,'' O'Neil said Wednesday. ``I had
the blade raised up high.''
   Then he noticed pieces of his Datsun emerging from under the
12-by 5-foot blade and tracks.
   ``Not a good feeling,'' O'Neil said. ``I backed up a bit hoping
it wasn't as bad as I thought it was.''
   O'Neil said his next car would have a large flag waving over it
when he is at work.

<HEAD>Deposed Hard-liner Asks To Speak Before Parliament, Aims To Head
Off Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted hard-line Communist leader Todor
Zhivkov, seeking to head off a possible trial on charges he abused
power, has asked to speak before Parliament about his rule.
   Lawmakers agreed Wednesday to allow the 78-year-old Zhivkov to
address a session but did not set a date.
   Zhivkov is ``ready to stand before the Grand National Assembly
and tell the Bulgarian people the truth'' about his 35 years in
power, Rumen Vodenicharov, head of the Association for the Defense
of Human Rights, told Parliament.
   Zhivkov, in the message read by Vodenicharov, also appealed to
the assembly to stop the official probe into his past. He has been
under investigation for alleged abuses of power and
misappropriation of state property. He has also been accused of
fomenting ethnic unrest.
   Zhivkov was ousted in November by reform Communists. He has
since been under virtual house arrest or in the hospital.
   Along with Erich Honecker of East Germany, Zhivkov is the only
surviving ousted Eastern European hard-line leader to face possible
prosecution. It is doubtful that the ailing 77-year-old Honecker
would ever be brought to trial.
   Earlier this month, the chief prosecutor's office announced that
it expected to complete its preliminary investigation of Zhivkov
this week. The prosecutor would then have a month to decide whether
to put Zhivkov on trial, and if so, set a date for the proceedings.
   Zhivkov was the author of so-called ``Bulgarization,'' or
persecution and forced assimilation of the nation's 1.5 million
ethnic Turks and other native Bulgarian Muslims.
   After his ouster, he was accused of corruption when it was
revealed he had maintained at least 30 holiday and hunting retreats
throughout this poor Balkan nation of 9 million people.
   Zhivkov's often-violent forced assimilation policy banned Moslem
religious practices and required ethnic Turks and Moslems to
forsake their own names and take Bulgarian ones.
   It was overturned by the reformed Communists who deposed him.
   At Wednesday's session, the assembly's newly elected chairman
Nikolai Todorov proposed appointing a commission to investigate
allegations of irregularities in last month's multiparty elections
_ the first free elections in Bulgaria in 58 years.
   He also proposed establishing a commission to work out new rules
of parliamentary procedure and making personnel changes in the
Supreme Court and other courts.
   In last month's elections, the ruling Socialist Party, formerly
the Communists, won 211 seats for a majority in the 400-member
Parliament. The main opposition coalition, the Union of Democratic
Forces, took 144 seats.
   While foreign observers could not confirm initial allegations of
widespread manipulations, the Central Electoral Commission received
a list of complaints about local irregularities in the balloting.
   The Parliament must also choose a new national president to
replace Petar Mladenov, a Socialist, who resigned earlier this
month under public pressure after a videotape was released in which
he was heard to call for the use of tanks against anti-government
demonstrators in December. Tanks were not used.
   It was not clear when the Parliament would vote for a new
president.

   Reebok has dropped Madonna as spokeswoman for
the athletic shoe company before she filmed a single commercial.
   The company and the pop singer had agreed to, but not signed, a
contract that would have paid her nearly $6 million, The Los
Angeles Times reported.
   But Bernadette Mansur, Reebok's vice president of marketing
communications, said, ``Madonna's availability and our need to get
her weren't a mesh.''
   Maddona is xurrently on a world tour and publicists at Creative
Artists Agency had no immediate comment Wednesday.
   Last year, Pepsi signed a $5 million contract with Madonna. But
the soft-drink maker took her commercial off the air because some
people confused it with her ``Like a Prayer'' music video, which
contained religious imagery some found offensive.
   Lawsuits and counter-claims also have been filed between Nike
and Madonna over an alleged $4.25 million endorsement agreement.

   ``King of Las Vegas'' Wayne Newton says he
isn't offended that a hotel celebrated his 30th anniversary on
stage 14 months late.
   Newton, 46, first appeared at the Fremont Hotel on May 16, 1959.
In those 31 years and two months since, he's played to 15 million
people.
   He was toasted in the Elvis Presley Suite at the Las Vegas
Hilton on Tuesday night as he began a new show there. He also
appears in a new movie, ``The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,'' and
has a new record, ``At This Moment.''
   This week also is the first time the Wayne Newton International
Fan Club Inc., based in Grand Rapids, Mich., has brought together
all its chapters for an annual convention. About 150 members plan
to be in the audience for Newton's shows this week.
   Carole Stewart, a spokeswoman for the Hilton, said Tuesday was
the first chance the hotel had to celebrate Newton's three decades
in show business.
   Newton didn't complain.
   ``I don't live in a chronological world. So many people do,'' he

gymnastics has finally become fun for Mary Lou Retton.
   ``Now I perform, I don't compete and that makes a real
difference,'' Retton said.
   Retton was the sensation of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los
Angeles. Her gold medal, in the all-around competition, was the
first ever for an American woman gymnast.
   ``When we were practicing for the Olympics, we spent eight hours
a day in the gym,'' she said Monday. ``The time in between
practice, we were too tired to do anything else.''
   ``If you want to be successful you give up your social life. You
give up everything except gymnastics,'' she said.
   Now, Retton performs six to eight times a year, travels as a
motivational speaker and does charity work. She also is engaged to
be married in December.

   Personal possessions of former
billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt _ from art to a popcorn popper _
will be auctioned off Saturday.
   Hunt and brother William Herbert Hunt, who sought bankruptcy
protection when their silver fortune collapsed a decade ago, were
ordered to sell possessions to pay their creditors. The Internal
Revenue Service is owed the most.
   ``The public will really have a rare inside look into the lives
of one of America's most interesting families,'' said trustee
Carter Pate. He called the auction ``distasteful for all parties
involved.''
   Pate expects to take in $200,000 from the sale at Bunker Hunt's
Circle T Ranch, one of his favorite retreats.
   The premier piece of the auction may prove to be Hunt's gigantic
rocking chair, with a cowhide seat and his name burned into the
back.
   Antiques dealers said they are excited by the collection of
porcelain birds by Edward Marshall Boehm.
   Items with the Circle T emblem, including drapes and linens, and
more mundane furnishings, like tissue dispensers and the Hunts'
hot-air electric popcorn popper, will be for sale.

<HEAD>Father to Appeal Judge's Refusal to Order Bone-Marrow Transplant
Tests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The father of a leukemia-stricken boy says he'll
appeal a judge's refusal to force the child's twin half-siblings to
be tested as possible bone-marrow donors.
   Tamas Bosze says a bone-marrow transplant is the only hope for
saving the life of his 12-year-old son, Jean-Pierre.
   Bosze sought a court order after the 3-year-old twins' mother,
Nancy Curran _ his former girlfriend _ objected to the blood tests
tests. Doctors say family members have a better chance of being
compatible donors than strangers.
   The predicament of Jean-Pierre, Bosze's son by another woman,
``evokes sympathy from all who've heard the story,'' Cook County
Circuit Judge Monica Reynolds said in a written ruling.
   But, the judge said, ``An order forcing the twins to submit to a
blood test and possibly to a bone marrow harvesting at a later date
would be an invasion of their constitutional rights of privacy.''
   ``To subject a healthy child to bodily intrusions, against the
will of the custodial parent in order to attempt to save a diseased
child ... is not a duty the courts can impose upon a child or
anyone else,'' the judge wrote.
   Bosze said he was disappointed but would appeal.
   ``This is not over,'' he said.
   Ms. Curran's attorney, Beverly Pekala, said her client felt
vindicated by the judge's decision but remains fearful that the
tests would endanger her twins' lives. Ms. Curran was not in court.
   Dr. Jong J. Kwon, Jean-Pierre's physician, argued that the
potential to save the boy's life outweighs the slight risks _
including pain, possible anemia or infection _ involved in testing
and then extracting bone marrow.
   Jean-Pierre's parents and other family members were found to be
incompatible donors. Kwon said the boy, diagnosed with leukemia in
1989, is not improving and he must undergo several doses of
chemotherapy a week.
   Kwon said he is trying to keep the boy's spirits up.
   ``I told him that transplantation has the best chance, but even
if the twins are not the donor we can still look for some other
volunteer donor,'' Kwon said. ``We cannot say there is no hope.''

   A rare cancer usually found in just
nine of every million children struck three babies in this small
central Illinois town. Residents suspect an abandoned coal factory
is to blame.
   But state health officials told residents Wednesday night that
it's premature to assess responsibility for the cancer cluster.
   The children, ranging in age from 6 months to 22 months, have
been diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a cancer of the adrenal glands
and sympathetic nervous system that occurs primarily in children
under age 10. The sympathetic nervous system controls some
automatic body functions.
   State health experts are studying medical records and the
incidence of cancer in Taylorville, a city of 11,000 people about
210 miles southwest of Chicago.
   The childrens' parents and others in the community suspect the
cancer cluster is linked to an abandoned factory site that was
contaminated with coal tar. The affected children all live within
three miles of the site.
   ``It's too much to be a coincidence,'' said Brenda May, whose
7-month-old daughter, Erika, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma soon
after birth and underwent successful surgery to remove a tumor.
   A second child, 22-month-old Zachary Donaldson, has been
declared cured; 6-month-old Chad Hryhorysak is undergoing
chemotherapy.
   Symptoms include weight loss, body aches, paleness and
irritability. In some cases, tumors cause diarrhea and high blood
pressure. The condition can be fatal if left untreated, but is
usually caught in time.
   Residents have formed the Taylorville Awareness Group to press
for government investigation of the cancer cluster.
   At a town meeting on the issue Wednesday night, state
toxicologist Tom Long told residents they shouldn't blame the
abandoned factory yet.
   ``It is right and good for you to be concerned about the cancer
and your environment,'' Long said. ``However, at this stage of the
game, it's not right or productive to link the two.''
   About half of the 50 residents at the meeting signed a petition
asking the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to
investigate. State health officials said their own investigation
would suffice.
   Before the meeting, Mrs. May said that while she was pregnant
with Erika, she often took her two older daughters to play in a
park next to the former site of a Central Illinois Public Service
Co. plant that made coal gas for street lights. The plant shut down
in 1932.
   Thomas Hornshaw, who assesses toxic-chemical sites for the state
Environmental Protection Agency, said 9,000 cubic yards of coal tar
and contaminated soil were removed from the site in 1988.
   Although the site is no longer contaminated, residents could
have been exposed before and during the cleanup, he said.
   Studies have linked coal tar to lung and skin cancer, but not
specifically to neuroblastoma, health officials said.
   Mrs. May said she and other parents of cancer-stricken children
are resented by some residents who fear their town will be labeled
a cancer hazard.
   ``But they haven't stayed up all night and watched a heart
monitor to make sure their baby is still alive,'' she said.
   In the United States, neuroblastoma occurs in about nine of
every million live births every year, according to the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control. Fewer than 500 babies are born here every year.
   About 500 cases are reported each year across the country and
the prognosis is good if the cancer is diagnosed before age 2.
   Researchers don't know exactly what causes neuroblastoma, but
heredity plays a role and a virus or environmental factors might be
involved, said Dr. Holly Howe, chief epidemiologist for the
Illinois Department of Public Health.

<TEXT>
   A New York toymaker is recalling 7,600 ``Bead
Coaster'' toys because the wooden beads may become detached and
pose a fatal choking hazard to young children.
   The three metal blue, yellow and red wires of the toys form a
hill and valley roller-coaster shaped vertical field attached to a
wooden base to create what a spokeswoman for the Consumer Product
Safety Commission called ``an activity toy.''
   Wooden beads of various shapes and colors are threaded through
and move easily about the wires. It is these beads that may become
detached and pose a potentially fatal choking hazard, the
commission said Wednesday.
   The toy was imported from Taiwan by Associated Merchandising
Corp. of New York and sold nationwide from September 1989 to March
1990 under the trade name ``Creative Years,'' which appears on the
wooden base.
   Consumers are advised to take the toys from children immediately
and return them the store where purchased for a refund.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army is reaffirming plans to ship several
hundred tons of chemical weapons from storage sites in West Germany
to a Pacific atoll for destruction in incinerators now being tested.
   To meet federal environmental requirements the Army had
considered several alternatives, including leaving the chemical
weapons in Germany or moving them to the United States for
destruction at incinerators now on the drawing boards.
   In announcing its decision Wednesday to stick to its original
plan for destroying the chemical agents on Johnston Island, the
Army said the operation ``is expected to have minimal public
health, safety and environmental effects'' on Johnson Island and
the Pacific area. The island is about 700 miles southwest of Hawaii.
   The Army began testing the $240 million Johnston Atoll Chemical
Agent Disposal System on June 30. It halted the tests on the same
day after encountering what Army officials called minor problems;
testing resumed last weekend.
   The plant is expected to start full-scale operations in 1992.
   Congress ordered the Army in 1985 to destroy its arsenal of
older chemical weapons, including those in West Germany, by 1997.
The size of the stockpile is classified but is believed to be about
30,000 tons.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed
at their meeting in Washington in early June to reduce their
nation's stockpiles of chemical weapons by 80 percent over the next
decade.

<HEAD>Labor Department Examining Possible Leak Of Unemployment Figure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department is looking into the
possibility that its June unemployment report was leaked to traders
in financial markets by a news service.
   Spokesman Bob Zachariasiewicz said Wednesday that the matter
involves a monthly report released July 6 on unemployment in June.
   He said the department's action was not a formal investigation,
but a study of a report that the information had been leaked early
and caused a fluctuation in market activity.
   ``We had no way of telling that the market fluctuation was
caused by a premature release of the information,'' Zachariasiewicz
said.
   Just before the figure's release, one trader on the Chicago
Board of Trade began selling bond futures heavily, according to a
report Wednesday by Dow Jones. The selling spree could have been
the result of a lucky guess or could indicate a premature leak, the
service said.
   When the report is released each month, news organizations are
given copies at 8 a.m. on the condition that they not be released
until 8:30 a.m. Markets can rise or fall based on this information,
and its release even a minute prematurely has drawn the
department's ire in the past.
   Zachariasiewicz declined to say which news organization was
being reviewed but another Labor Department source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said it was a Japanese service.

<HEAD>Army Officer Arraigned In Cover-Up of Jesuit Killings Claims
Innocence</HEAD>

   An army officer charged with a
coverup in the slayings of six jesuit educators, their housekeeper
and her daughter denies he ordered the burning of documents in the
case.
   ``I'm innocent,'' Lt. Col. Carlos Camilio Hernandez told
reporters Wednesday after asking a judge to postpone his hearing
until a new defense lawyer is named.
   ``I trust in God, justice and my innocence, since I didn't order
the burning of any books,'' he said.
   Hernandez is charged with destroying logs that may have
contained evidence implicating nine army men, including the former
Military School director Col. Guillermo Benavides, in the November
massacre.
   The brutal slayings and sluggish investigation have prompted
lawmakers in Washington, which backs the right-wing government of
President Alfredo Cristiani with millions of dollars in aid, to
call for a funding cut.
   Hernandez' lawyer Carlos Castellon resigned from the case
Wednesday, claiming he had been threatened.
   A prosecution lawyer said the log books ``are key evidence'' in
the investigation because they show departures of army officers
charged with leaving the military academy to kill the Jesuits on
Nov. 16.
   The killings took place on the Catholic University campus on the
fifth day of the biggest guerrilla offensive in 10 years of
Salvadoran civil war.
   Cristiani and the army high command immediately blamed the
killings on the guerrilla Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   But U.S. Army Maj. Erick Buckland told superiors that Salvadoran
Col. Carlos Armando Aviles told him Col. Benavides ordered the
massacre.
   Aviles later denied saying he knew who took part in the killings.
   Judge Ricardo Zamora has told the Salvadoran Foreign Ministry to
ask the U.S. Embassy's permission for Buckland to provide further
testimony.
   The investigations have led to the arrest of Benavides,
Hernandez, two colonels, two lieutenants and four enlisted men.
   Benavides is the highest ranking official of the Salvadoran army
ever accused of human rights violations in the history of the civil
war. No officer has been convicted on that charge.
   The evidence against Benavides to date consists of testimony by
other army men charged in the case. Under Salvadoran law, such
testimony cannot be admitted as legal proof.

<HEAD>Karl Menninger, Dean of American Psychiatry, Dead at 96</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT TRUELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Karl Menninger, who pushed psychiatry
into the American mainstream and for more than six decades strove
for the compassionate treatment of the mentally ill, has died at
age 96.
   The pioneer died of abdominal cancer at Stormont-Vail Regional
Medical Center on Wednesday, just four days before his birthday.
   If psychoanalysis was born in Vienna, the child of Sigmund
Freud, it grew strong on the Kansas prairie under the guidance of
Menninger. Friends and associates said he nurtured psychiatry into
a medical speciality.
   ``He was one of the first American psychiatrists to integrate
psychoanalytic theory into his practice,'' said Dr. Elissa Benedek,
president of the American Psychiatric Association.
   Menninger was once hailed by the association as the nation's
``greatest living psychiatrist.'' A hot-tempered, excitable
maverick, he jolted popular thought with his theories on crime,
prisons and child abuse.
   Menninger grew up in Topeka and attended Harvard Medical School.
He interned at Boston Psychopathic Hospital, returning to Topeka in
1919.
   In 1925, he and his father, Charles, and brother, William,
converted a 13-room farmhouse into a clinic, which later became the
renowned Menninger with the largest training program in the world
for psychiatrists.
   ``My chief purpose in the beginning was to show you could treat
`insane' people,'' Menninger once recalled. ``Everybody thought
they were untreatable. But I said they were being treated every
day. We demonstrated you could treat people in a better way.''
   Menninger applied Freudian principles to people who were
mentally ill but not psychotic, said Philip Holzman, professor of
psychology at Harvard University. Before that, such people were not
considered worthy of treatment, he said.
   ``He entered psychiatry at a time when psychiatry was defining
itself,'' Holzman said.
   Dr. Gertrude Ticho, who worked at the Menninger for 18 years and
is now in private practice in Washington, said Menninger was one of
the first psychiatrists to create an environment for psychiatric
patients based on compassion and treatment.
   Menninger's once-revolutionary approaches to mental illness
became standard as psychiatrists trained at Menninger established
their own practices, Ticho said.
   ``In a sense, he was a victim of his own success,'' she said.
``He trained at Menninger so many people who went out and set up
comparable clinics.''
   In 1930, Menninger published ``The Human Mind,'' which still is
used as a textbook. In 1938, he came out with ``Man Against
Himself,'' a seminal volume that examines patterns of
self-destructive behavior.
   Menninger's other books, including ``Love Against Hate,'' ``The
Crime of Punishment'' and ``What Ever Became of Sin?'' also drew a
wide readership outside of psychiatry.
   ``Dr. Menninger brought psychiatry to the average person,
widening public understanding and acceptance of psychiatry as an
agent of healing and help,'' Benedek said. ``He wrote and spoke in
the language of the average American, making mental illnesses more
understandable and less feared.''
   Menninger also explored the relationship between the mind and
the body, between mental health and physical well-being.
   ``Menninger was perhaps the foremost pioneer in refuting the
notion of two separate systems, one body, the other mind, in human
beings,'' said longtime friend Norman Cousins, who has written
about on health for the layman.
   ``He advanced the concept of a singular system in which both
mind and body were constituent parts,'' said Cousins, who teaches
at the University of California Medical School.
   Crime and reform dominated Menninger's thinking in later years.
   He moved to Chicago in 1966, serving as a consultant on prison
affairs and helping set up a mental health center in downtown
Chicago. He moved back to Topeka in 1974.
   Psychiatrists attribute reforms in mental hospitals to
Menninger. Under his guidance, Topeka State Hospital became a
national model for state hospitals across the country, Holzman said.
   ``Compassionate care of the mentally ill is the thing that
stands out with Menninger,'' said Cousins, who first met Menninger
in the late 1930s. ``All you have to do is visit a lot of mental
hospitals to realize we have not arrived at that form of
treatment.''

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo today, and share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
marginally.
   The dollar closed at 147.60 yen, up 0.35 yen from Wednesday's
close. It opened at 148.05 yen and ranged between 147.40 yen and
148.18 yen.
   Spot transactions totaled $10.501 billion, down from Wednesday's
$11.740 billion.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 7.51
points, or 0.02 percent, to 33,055.62. The index had shed 124.17
points on Wednesday.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 600 million shares,
unchanged from Wednesday.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bond stood at 86.52 points as of 4:00 p.m. (3 a.m. EDT), down from
Wednesday's close of 86.70. The yield was 7.300 percent, up from
7.260.
   The dollar gained ground after a round of buy-backs in early
trading in which traders tried to cover short, or oversold
positions, dealers said.
   Akihiko Kagawa, a dealer with Bank of Tokyo, reasoned that
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before the U.S.
Congress on Wednesday did little to clarify the outlook for U.S.
interest rates. Many traders had oversold the dollars, anticipating
Greenspan would indicate easier credit is ahead, he said.
   Lower interest rates tend to drop a currency's value.
   On the stock market, share prices remained slightly lower during
most of the day's mild trading until a last-minute round of
index-linked buying lifted the benchmark Nikkei index, said Yoshiro
Inoue of Nomura Securities.

<TEXT>
   An electrician's manslaughter conviction
for work that caused a fire and killed a 12-year-old has
implications for other electricians nationwide, industry officials
say.
   Richard E. Salz faced sentencing Friday after a jury last month
found him guilty of improperly installing a baseboard heating unit
in the East Haven, Conn., home where the boy died.
   ``I think the individual (Salz) deserves what happens. But to
put the rest of my trade in jeopardy of manslaughter is asking a
lot,'' Lou Acampora, president of the Connecticut Electrical
Contractors Association, said Wednesday.
   ``This sets a bad precedent. It puts a lot of good electricians
in jeopardy for making a mistake,'' he said.
   Phil Simmons, executive director of the Park Ridge, Ill.-based
International Association of Electrical Contractors, said, ``I hope
it has a sobering effect and that people realize they will be held
responsible for their actions.''
   Simmons said he knows of no other case in which an electrician
was charged with manslaughter for a death resulting from electrical
work he has done.
   Lawrence Acquarulo, an assistant state building inspector who
testified at Salz's trial, said the electrician should have known
his work was a fire hazard.
   ``This was not just John Q. Public making an honest mistake,''
he said.
   Salz, 49, from East Haven, faces a maximum prison term of 10
years.
   The boy, Burton Gorman III, died of smoke inhalation in the fire
Dec. 26, 1988, at his grandparents' home.
   Salz failed to get a permit for the work, ignored the
manufacturer's instructions for installing the heater in the home's
basement and committed more than a dozen electrical code
violations, Acquarulo said.
   Salz connected the 120-volt unit to a 240-volt circuit box,
doubling the amount of heat that was supposed to come from the
heater, Acquarulo said. The unit overheated and ignited wall
paneling, investigators said.
   Salz's license as a contractor was revoked in July 1989, but the
state Electrical Work Examining Board gave him a journeyman's
license allowing him to work under supervision.

<HEAD>Governor Signs Big Tax Increase</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who bragged about the
``Massachusetts Miracle'' during his failed presidential bid, has
signed a bill taxing myriad services to infuse the state with
needed cash.
   Dukakis signed the bill Wednesday behind closed doors. ``This is
not something to celebrate,'' he said later.
   ``Taxes are like medicine,'' he said. ``Nobody likes to
prescribe them. Nobody likes to take them. But taxes are part of
what will be required to regain fiscal health in the state.''
   The measure raises state income and gasoline taxes and extends
the 5 percent sales tax to hundreds of business services that are
now exempt. The new law is expected to generate $1.2 billion this
fiscal year and an additional $1.8 billion next fiscal year.
   State officials said residents will start feeling the effects of
the law at the gasoline pump within 10 days and will start seeing a
bigger bite out of their paychecks as early as three weeks.
   Opponents argued the state constitution forbids some of the
sales taxes on services, but the state Supreme Judicial Court
supported the concept in an advisory opinion Tuesday.
   The huge tax boost marks another chapter in the up-and-down
fortunes of Dukakis and Massachusetts. Two years ago, Dukakis was
preparing to accept the Democratic nomination for the presidency as
he bragged about the ``Massachusetts Miracle.''
   But since then, the economy has soured, revenue has shrunk, and
state government has run up a deficit of more than $1 billion for
last fiscal year. Massachusetts' bond ratings have plummeted to the
lowest in the country.
   ``The only miracle that I can see is that working men and women
up to this time have been able to keep their heads above water,''
said House Minority Leader Steven Pierce, the Republican candidate
for governor. He said he will file legislation to repeal the tax
package.
   Dukakis is not running for re-election.

   Here is a brief description of the leading participants in
Cambodia's 11-year-old civil war:
   _The Vietnamese-installed government of Premier Hun Sen,
comprised largely of Khmer Rouge defectors, is fighting a coalition
of three Cambodian resistance groups.
   _The communist Khmer Rouge, armed by China, is the strongest of
the three. Its political leader is Khieu Samphan. The Khmer Rouge
ruled Cambodia in 1975-1978. During that time, hundreds of
thousands of its 8 million people died from Khmer Rouge executions,
famine and civil unrest.
   Knowledgeable sources say the Khmer Rouge has about 30,000
troops.
   _The Khmer People's National Liberation Front is one of two
non-communist guerrilla groups. It is led by former Cambodian Prime
Minister Son Sann. It was formed from a number of non-communist
groups that had fought the Khmer Rouge since 1975.
   _Non-communist followers of former Cambodian leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk have formed their own force, the National Sihanouk
Army. Sihanouk is the also leader of the resistance coalition.
Non-communist resistance forces number an estimated 20,000.
   The resistance is based along the Thai border, armed principally
by China. It holds Cambodia's U.N. seat.
   _The Soviet-backed Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in late 1978,
ousting the Khmer Rouge government. Vietnam announced it had
removed all its troops from Cambodia in September. Since then, the
resistance has made its biggest gains of the war.

   Art and antiques that decorated Greta Garbo's
apartment will be auctioned at Sotheby's in November for a targeted
$20 million, the auction house says.
   The 250 items are not personal effects but a collection
purchased by the reclusive film legend, Sotheby's President Diana
D. Brooks said Wednesday. Garbo died April 15 at age 84.
   ``What's exciting for us is that it is a serious art collection
that was acquired and lived with by one of the legendary figures of
the 20th century,'' she said.
   Garbo's estate, executed by her niece, Gray Reisfield,
authorized the Nov. 13-15 sale.
   The art collection includes three Renoirs, 18th-century French
furniture, decorative rugs, rare books, and Continental, English
and Chinese ceramics. All were kept in her seven-room Manhattan
co-op.
   The Swedish-born actress performed in 27 movies, including
``Anna Christie,'' ``Mata Hari,'' ``Grand Hotel,'' ``Queen
Christina,'' ``Anna Karenina,'' ``Camille'' and ``Ninotchka.'' But
she retired in 1941, favoring her privacy to Hollywood stardom.

   Here is a chronological look at the Cambodian conflict:
   _On Christmas Day 1978, tanks rolled from Ban Me Thuot in the
central highlands to start Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and war
with its former Communist ally, the Khmer Rouge.
   _On Jan. 7, 1979, the Vietnamese marched into Phnom Penh. So
unexpectedly swift was the strike that the Khmer Rouge left behind
half-eaten meals and tons of arms as they fled.
   _On Jan. 10, a new Communist government was proclaimed. It was
led by Heng Samrin and other Khmer Rouge defectors who had fled to
Vietnam, fearing the previous government's bloody purges. But
sanctuary from Thailand and arms from China soon raised the Khmer
Rouge from its knees into a potent guerrilla insurgency.
   _In January-February 1979, China wages a border war against
Vietnam to ``punish'' it for the invasion of Cambodia.
   _In June 1982, the Khmer Rouge, the forces of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk and of former Premier Son Sann form a resistance
coalition. The United Nations recognizes it as Cambodia's
government.
   _In March 1985, Vietnamese forces, allied to the government in
Phnom Penh, overrun every major border camp in its greatest victory
of the war against the resistance coalition.
   _In December 1986, Nguyen Van Linh, head of Vietnam's Communist
Party, focuses on economic reform and breaking the international
isolation that the Cambodian war has caused.
   _In July 1987, Sihanouk holds peace talks in France with Phnom
Penh's Prime Minister Hun Sen.
   _On Dec. 19, 1988, Premier Li Peng says China will decrease its
aid to the resistance as Vietnam withdraws from Cambodia. He said
China will halt all aid when the troops are gone.
   _In December 1988, Vietnam begins its pullout of 50,000 troops.
   _In January 1989, Vietnam sends a senior official to Beijing to
discuss the conflict. The two sides agree that Vietnam will
withdraw its troops by September in exchange for an end to Chinese
aid to the guerrillas.
   _In July 1989, a 19-nation conference on Cambodia opens in
Paris. Sihanouk calls for interim government with Khmer Rouge
participation. Hun Sen strongly opposes the idea.
   _In September 1989, Vietnam says it has withdrawn its last
troops. Guerrillas call it a sham and begin a general offensive.
China calls the pullout a fraud and indicates it will continue
arming the guerrillas until there is a political settlement.
   _On Sept. 30, 1989, non-communist guerrillas seize the district
seat of Thmar Puok near Thai border. They make their greatest gains
in the war in the coming months.
   _On Feb. 11-13, 1990, the U.N. Security Council permanent
members, meeting in New York, say regrouping the Cambodian armies
into designated areas is essential to the peace process. But they
fail to agree on proposals to disarm the factions.
   _In February, Sihanouk and Hun Sen hold talks in Bangkok,
Thailand. They agree on the need for a U.N. presence in Cambodia
and a ``supreme national body.''
   _In April, Sihanouk urges an immediate cease-fire in his
country. He says the U.N. Security Council should deploy
peacekeeping troops to enforce it.
   _In June, Cambodian guerrillas launch major attacks and seize
areas of several provinces as Cambodia's warring factions prepare
to meet to discuss a cease-fire. Chinese, Thai and U.S. officials
join attempts to foster progress in peace talks stalled by the
Khmer Rouge refusal to attend.

   Paul McCartney proclaimed himself ``pro-corn''
and stuck to his anti-meat stance before he got down to rock 'n'
roll during his first concert in the nation's top pork and corn
state.
   The former Beatle is a vegetarian, which angered some livestock
producers and prompted radio stations to hire airplanes towing
banners that read: ``Paul Moo-Cartney'' and ``Paul Don't Have a Cow
Man.''
   McCartney told reporters before Wednesday night's concert that
he was more interested in promoting environmental awareness than
vegetarianism on his first world tour in 13 years.
   He said he and his wife, Linda, a keyboard player in his band,
have been vegetarians for 20 years. ``So we're used to the
meat-versus-vegetables argument,'' he said.
   McCartney's anti-meat sentiments bubbled to the surface this
month in livestock country when he decided to support People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals after country singer k.d. lang's
``Meat Stinks'' commercials for the group got her banned from some
Midwest radio stations, including at least one in Iowa.
   ``We haven't come out on this tour to preach against meat. We're
pro-corn, very pro-corn,'' McCartney said.
   Iowa is the nation's leading corn- and pork-producing state and
ranks fourth in beef that is fattened for market.
   The Maryland-based animal rights group set up an informational
booth at the concert, offering up tofu ``not dogs'' as an
alternative to meat-based hot dogs.
   A concert crowd of 54,000 jammed traffic in this central Iowa
city, which has a population of 45,600.

   The dollar was higher in European trading this

   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 147.60 yen, up 0.35 yen from

   The morning rate for the Dutch guilder was unavailable.
   The dollar gained ground in Tokyo after a round of buy-backs in
early trading in which traders tried to cover short, or oversold

   Many traders had oversold the dollars, anticipating Greenspan

   Brian Green, Treasury manager at the London branch of First City
Texas-Houston, said this left the dollar ``not knowing whether to

   ``Over time, I see the dollar going lower,'' added Mark Austin,
currency analyst at Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. in London.
   Gold was quoted at $361.55 per troy ounce at the morning fixing

<DATELINE>BAGUIO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hopes faded today for hundreds of
people missing and believed trapped under rubble three days after a
devastating earthquake on the main Philippines island of Luzon. The
official death toll neared 500.
   Monday's quake, which registered 7.7 on the Richter scale,
toppled buildings and triggered landslides across a wide area north
of the capital.
   Rescuers said there could be 250 more dead in the ruins of a
school in Cabanatuan City, two flattened hotels in Baguio and in
this city's factory district, where search operations have not
begun.
   That does not include others who may be in cars, buses and
trucks reported buried in landslides or hurled into ravines
elsewhere on Luzon in the temblor.
   As many as 30,000 people fled on foot from this mountain resort
north of Manila, heading for the lowlands along a highway blocked
by landslides, an official said.
   All roads to the city had been cut off iin the quake and
authorities hoped to blast through remaining mudslides and open one
today.
   Figures compiled by the Office of Civil Defense and the Red
Cross showed at least 490 people were killed and 1,000 injured in
the quake. Officials said two Americans were among the dead and
five were missing.
   Manila television stations reported that hundreds of thousands
of people in central Luzon lacked electricity, drinking water and
food and many were camped along highways for fear of aftershocks.
   President Corazon Aquino ordered price controls on rice, pork
and other commodities in short supply throughout the affected area.
But survivors complained of price-gouging and food shortages.
   Especially hard-hit was Baguio, 110 miles north of Manila, where
1,500 Americans live. Officials said scores of people were believed
trapped in eight hotels that were severely damaged.
   American rescuers today said they halted search operations at
the Nevada Hotel in Baguio after recovering the bodies of Richard
Finley, an official of the U.S. Agency for International
Development, and the wife of former Education Minister Jaime Laya.
   Both had been attending a USAID conference. Officials said about
20 Filipinos working for USAID were missing and feared dead in the
hotel.
   U.S. officials said an American woman was killed but her name
was withheld pending notification of kin.
   ``The rescue effort (at the Nevada) is over,'' said John
Mitchell, a fireman from Miami, Fla., who was among Americans sent
by the U.S. government for the rescue effort. ``Nobody's alive in
there.''
   Mario Say-Ocha, a miner who volunteered to search through the
Hyatt, said he was not optimistic. ``The stench is terrible
inside,'' he said. ``It can turn your stomach.''
   In Manila, Highway Secretary Fiorello Estuar said clearing
operations along the road to Baguio were hampered because 20,000 to
30,000 people were using the highway to walk to the lowlands of La
Union province.
   There were no estimates of the economic impact of the quake on
the country's struggling economy. Preliminary estimates ran more
than $1 billion because many buildings, hotels, bridges and
highways were destroyed.
   In Manila, Rep. Rolando Andaya, chairman of the House
appropriations committee, said he would propose a two-year
suspension of payments on the country's $26 billion foreign debt to
free funds for reconstruction.
   The House resumes sessions Monday after the summer recess, and
Andaya said he expected the resolution to pass easily.
   Scores of workers were believed missing in factories of the
Baguio Export Processing Zone, where a building caught fire during
the quake. Search efforts have not begun there because the plant
was still smoldering.
   In Cabanatuan, 60 miles north of Manila, British technicians
using sensor devices found no signs of life today in the rubble of
the six-story Philippine Christian College.
   Hundreds of students and teachers were trapped when the building
collapsed. Rescuers found 137 survivors and 60 dead in Cabanatuan.
British rescuers said sensors indicated about 25 bodies remained
buried there.
   Local officials told Manila radio stations that numerous other
victims were probably buried in landslides near Baguio and
elsewhere in the northern mountains.
   In La Union and Tarlac provinces, thousands of people slept in
cars and in their yards because of damage to their homes and fears
of another quake. Huge fissures of up to a half-mile cut highways
throughout the area.
   Thousands remained camped in Baguio city parks, many with only
umbrellas for shelter in the frequent thunderstorms.
   ``We will just walk,'' one woman said. ``It's dangerous on the
road because of the landslides. But it would be much safer than
staying indoors.''

<HEAD>Coast Guard Absolves Exxon in Waterway Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard absolved Exxon Corp. of major
blame in an oil spill in a New York Harbor waterway last January,
but said workers who ignored an alarm added to the extent of the
spill.
   According to a report released Wednesday a crack in an
underwater pipeline caused the Jan. 1 leak of 567,000 gallons of
heating oil into the busy ship channel between Staten Island and
New Jersey.
   The leak was not discovered immediately because a computerized
leak detection system failed to shut off the oil flow, and workers
at the refinery disregarded alarms that oil was leaking, the report
said.
   The report also concluded that dredging equipment probably
dented the 12-inch underwater pipeline, which runs about 6.7 miles
from a refinery to a terminal on the New Jersey side of the Arthur
Kill waterway.
   Exxon spokesmen did not immediately return calls.
   Federal and state grand juries in New Jersey are still
investigating the spill. It was the first in a series of mishaps
that have plagued the Arthur Kill and the adjacent Kill Van Kull
this year, polluting the waters and shorelines, endangering
wildlife and disrupting ship traffic.
   The Exxon refinery was the scene of another spill Wednesday. A
barge leaving the refinery at Linden, N.J., struck a docked barge
and spilled about 37,000 gallons of home heating oil into the
Arthur Kill.
   Coast Guard officials said the spill posed little risk to the
environment. They said hot weather would speed evaporation and the
cleanup.

<HEAD>State Employees Frown on Happy Face Pins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state campaign featuring those perky,
yellow happy faces on lapel pins has some state workers frowning.
   The workers are complaining they're being forced to wear the
pins with the message ``YES WE CAN!'' over Gov. William Donald
Schaefer's name.
   William H. Bolander, director of Council 92 of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said workers
dislike the buttons because they think ``it's a subtle way to
endorse the governor in an election year.''
   Some, he said, claim they were threatened with discipline,
including suspension, if they refused to wear them.
   State officials have denied that.
   Robert B. Sivert, director of facilities management for the
Department of General Services, said Wednesday that his July 6
memorandum telling workers to wear the pins was a request _ not an
order.
   ``If they choose not to wear the buttons, there is no
disciplinary action that's going to be taken,'' Sivert said.
   The campaign is aimed at encouraging all 70,000 state employees
to treat the public with kindness, courtesy and concern.
   ``We're just talking about reminding employees that they're
important in the lives of others and that they make a difference.
... I resent even the implication that there's any kind of
relationship between a political campaign and this promotion,''
said Samantha K. Weiner, a public relations consultant to the state
Department of Personnel and the creator of the campaign.
   Asked why the governor's name is on all the promotion's
materials, Weiner said, ``Because he is a Maryland state employee
and is representative of the promotional campaign.''

<HEAD>Philip Leacock, Director Known for Work with Child Actors, Dead at
72</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Philip Leacock, a film and TV director who was
noted for his work with child actors and directed episodes of
popular U.S. television TV series, has died aged 72.
   Leacock, who lived in Pacific Palisades, outside Los Angeles,
died suddenly on July 14 in London while on holiday with his
family, a death notice said. It gave no cause of death.
   Born Oct. 8, 1917, Leacock made artistic documentaries before
taking on feature-length movies.
   His 1950s work with child actors was most notable in ``The
Kidnappers,'' a hit family movie set in Nova Scotia; ``The Spanish
Gardener'' starring Dirk Bogarde; ``Innocent Sinners'' with Flora
Robson; and ``The Rabbit Trap'' with Ernest Borgnine.
   He moved to Hollywood in the early 1960s, where he made ``The
War Lover.'' Based on John Hersey's novel about a World War II
pilot, it starred Steve McQueen.
   Other Leacock films were ``Take a Giant Step,'' about a black
youth's encounter with racism, and ``Let No Man Write My Epitaph,''
about juvenile drug addiction. He also directed episodes of
``Gunsmoke,'' ``Route 66,'' ``The Waltons'' and ``The Defenders.''
   He retired in 1987, after directing an acclaimed three-part TV
drama about the Salem witchhunts, ``Three Sovereigns for Sister
Sarah,'' starring Vanessa Redgrave.
   Leacock's first marriage ended in divorce and in 1959 and he
married Carolyn Slater. Each marriage produced two children.
   He is to be cremated in London on July 23.

<HEAD>Report: Agreement Clearing Way For Constitutional Talks is Near</HEAD>

government close to agreement on talks. Pickup 5th graf pvs,

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The South African government
and the African National Congress are close to an agreement that
would pave the way for constitutional talks on ending
white-minority rule, a report said today.
   The Star newspaper, citing government officials, said the two
sides appeared to be on the verge of resolving problems that had
been blocking talks, including an ANC demand for release of
political prisoners.
   The report, which came a day after ANC leader Nelson Mandela
returned from a triumphant 14-nation tour, said Mandela and
President F.W. de Klerk were ``likely to meet within days.''
   The Star, an English-language newspaper, has been supportive of
de Klerk's reform efforts.
   On his arrival at Johannesburg's international airport on
Wednesday, Mandela said the world was behind the fight to end
apartheid in South Africa and that white-minority government could
not last much longer.
   ``We return home full of hope for the future of our
country...,'' Mandela told cheering supporters. ``The world is with
us in wishing for the speediest resolution to the country's
problems.''
   Government officials said today no date had been set for a
meeting between Mandela and de Klerk, but they expected contacts
fairly soon.
   Mandela said he was optimistic the ANC and the government were
moving toward an agreement to end apartheid and give blacks
political rights. Having held their first-ever meeting in May, the
government and ANC are trying to clear the way for full-scale talks.
   ``They are one with us in demanding the end of apartheid now,''
Mandela said. But he ruled out any concessions on the ANC's refusal
to end its armed struggle and accept a cease-fire, for which the
ANC has set various conditions.
   The conditions include the release of hundreds of prisoners the
ANC says are political internees.
   ``The agreement between the government and ourselves is as soon
as the government has removed the obstacles to negotiations. ...
Then we would be prepared to consider the suspension of
hostilities,'' he told an airport news conference.
   Mandela and his aides said the ANC had gained major political
support on their six-week tour of North America, Europe and Africa,
but they gave few details. Mandela was lauded and idolized in the
United States, where vast crowds turned out to cheer him.
   The ANC said Mandela's return from neighboring Mozambique was
delayed several hours after it received anonymous threats against
its leaders and its offices.
   ANC officials said they received a message by facsimile mail
saying: ``July 18, 1990 the last day of freedom for the ANC inside
the Republic of South Africa.''
   The message also claimed there were bombs on Mandela's flight
and at the airport. Scores of heavily-armed police guarded the
airport and searched for bombs, but reported finding nothing.
   Right-wing white extremists who oppose plans to end apartheid
have claimed responsibility for a series of bombings in recent
weeks.
   Mandela, looking tired, was greeted by about 200 supporters and
relatives on his 72nd birthday. It was his first birthday in
freedom after 27 years in prison for fighting the white-minority
government.
   The supporters sang ``Happy Birthday Dear Leader!'' and chanted
``ANC!''
   Asked how he was feeling on his birthday, Mandela, who came down
with a mild case of pnuemonia last week, said: ``I feel like a boy
of 36, and the present I would like to have is votes for all.''
   Mandela said if the government embraces major reforms, the ANC
might be willing to consider asking that international economic
sanctions on South Africa be eased before a new constitution is
negotiated.
   His statement was in contrast to his strong demands on his
overseas tour for no relaxation in sanctions.
   Mandela appeared more authoritative and commanding after his
tour. He was crisp with reporters and tartly declined to answer
several questions, in contrast to his more easy-going style in the
past.
   As part of reforms by de Klerk, Mandela was released from jail
in February and the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups were
legalized. De Klerk has promised to end apartheid and share
political power with the black majority.

   Three teen-agers wading through a storm
drain drowned when a sudden storm flooded the culvert and pinned
them inside.
   Fire officials said } inches of rain fell in less than 20
minutes when thunderstorms hit lower Michigan on Wednesday.
   ``We had three teens swimming in Gilkey Creek when the heavy
rains came,'' Battalion Chief John Balser said. ``All the rain
water in the area converges in the one culvert. The water pressure
pinned them against a steel grate.''
   Marvin Corbin, 17, and Patrick Hoye, 17, and his 13-year-old
brother Michael, were killed, said Flint police Sgt. Ron Mossman.
   The band of storms stretched from Muskegon to Bay City. Heavy
rains and gusty winds knocked over small trees in Fenton, while
hail fell in Bay, Genesee, Midland and Saginaw counties.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms broke out in Minnesota and Nebraska
this morning while skies remained cloudy over much of the country
after a night of heavy rain, the National Weather Service said.

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias battled today
with artillery and rockets around mountain villages of south
Lebanon for a fourth day and kidnapped each other's members in
Beirut.
   Fighting between the Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah, or
Party of God, and the Syrian-backed Amal militia wounded at least
two women and an Amal militiaman.
   That raised the casualty toll from four days of fighting to 64
Shiites killed and 221 wounded in the area southeast of Sidon, the
provincial capital and port 25 miles south of Beirut.
   Both sides agreed to a midday ``mercy cease-fire'' so casualties
could be evacuated, said the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
   Clashes raged on for several hours after the cease-fire was to
have taken effect, but finally a convoy of eight ambulances was
able to enter the hilltop village of Jarjou, an Amal stronghold
captured by Hezbollah late Monday, to take out the dead and wounded.
   Red Cross teams began bringing the wounded to hospitals in the
provincial capital of Sidon, 10 miles to the northeast.
   Police said earlier that the village square, scene of savage
close-quarter fighting Monday, was ``littered with bodies.''
   In an attempt to separate the warring militias and stem the
Hezbollah advance on Sidon, the PLO has moved into a string of
villages including Sarba, which is 2 miles northwest of Jarjou.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting on and off for three years
for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest
sect. More than 1,100 people have been killed and nearly 3,400
wounded in the power struggle.
   Police said masked gunmen from the rival factions raided houses
in west and south Beirut during the night in a chain of kidnappings
in which at least 40 members of the two organizations were seized.
   Amal and Hezbollah gunmen fled Beirut's streets after daybreak
when Syrian troops moved in to prevent shootouts.
   Beirut's independent an-Nahar daily reported that the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which deployed a force of 600 guerrillas
into the battle zone on Tuesday, withdrew an ultimatum to the
fundamentalists to pull out of Jarjou.
   The PLO force, drawn mainly from PLO leader Yasser Arafat's
Fatah faction, occupied Sarba and other villages Tuesday to form a
4-mile buffer zone to block Hezbollah's advance west toward the
Mediterranean from its mountain strongold.
   The PLO guerrillas came under Hezbollah shellfire Wednesday and
six guerrillas were wounded.
   The PLO has an estimated 5,000 hard-core fighters in their bases
in refugee camps in Sidon.
   A Hezbollah-controlled region stretching to the coast would open
a new supply outlet, cut off Amal's stronghold in the south from
Beirut and threaten the Palestinian bases by linking up with
anti-Arafat Palestinian radicals.
   Hezbollah's mountain enclave is bordered in the the east by
Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon.

   Fighting has continued along the border between
the Soviet Central Asian republics of Kirghizia and Uzbekistan,
driving the death toll to 212, the state news agency Tass reported
today.
   ``Reports are still coming in of fights, arson and pogroms,''
Tass reported. ``Passing cars are being stoned. Barricades are
being built.''
   Fighting broke out June 4 in a land dispute between members of
the Kirghiz and Uzbek ethnic groups. Both are largely Sunni Moslem
and speak Turkish.
   The unrest has caused damage estimated at $68 million and left
more than 400 people missing and possibly dead, the newspaper
Rabochaya Tribuna reported. Earlier, Soviet media had reported 800
people were missing in the area.
   Soviet authorities have bolstered the contingent of Soviet
troops in the region by sending Col. Gen. Yuri Shatalin, commander
of Interior Ministry troops, to the region, Tass reported.
   A series of violent ethnic disputes have erupted intermittently
in the Soviet Union since President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has come
to power.

   The single-engine P-51 Mustang fighter crashed Wednesday, about
30 miles southwest of Minneapolis. Killed were pilot Kermit LaQuey,

Louis.
   LaQuey was chief pilot for the Planes of Fame Air Museum, which

Flying Cloud Airport in suburban Minneapolis.
   Dick Rutan, co-pilot of the first aircraft to fly non-stop

but did not witness Wednesday's accident, authorities said.
   Carver County sheriff's officials said LaQuey's plane hit a

<HEAD>Burmese Students Demand Release of Opposition Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 150 youths marched through the
capital today in a protest demanding that the military government
free an opposition leader whose party won a national election and
allow her to take power.
   The protest came hours after a peaceful commemoration of Martyrs
Day, which marks the the assassination 43 years ago of independence
leaders.
   Those leaders include Gen. Aung San, the father of detained
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Her National League for
Democracy easily won the May 27 election, but the government has
given no indication that it will hand over power or free Ms. Suu
Kyi from house arrest.
   Witnesses said the youths shouted anti-government slogans as
they marched to the Martyrs Mausoleum hoisting the banner of Ms.
Suu Kyi's party.
   The number of soldiers around her house has been increased in
recent days, Western diplomats contacted in Rangoon from Thailand
said.
   After she led pro-democracy demonstrations that were crushed in
1988, the military government accused Ms. Suu Kyi of subversion and
put her under house arrest on July 20, 1989 for one year, saying
the sentence could be renewed.
   Small groups of high school students had staged demonstrations
in the city Tuesday and Wednesday calling for her release, a
Western diplomat said.
   A diplomat described an increased presence in the city of troops
armed with automatic rifles, particularly around the mausoleum.
   At the subdued government Martyrs Day ceremonies, the home and
information minister, Lt. Gen. Phone Myint, laid a wreath at the
mausoleum at the foot of the Shwedagon Pagoda.
   In the afternoon, members of Ms. Suu Kyi's political party also
laid wreaths there. Ms. Suu Kyi held a private religious ceremony
inside her house.
   Ms. Suu Kyi was a leader of the national pro-democracy uprisings
that military officers crushed in September 1988 by killing
hundreds of people.
   In May, the military rulers allowed the first multiparty
elections in three decades and severely restricted campaigning by
the opposition, but Ms. Suu Kyi's party still won 396 of the 485
seats in Parliament.
   On Friday, Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the head of military
intelligence, said the authorities would not yield to international
pressure for Ms. Suu Kyi's release and a transfer of power to her
party.
   ``We do not care at all about such threats,'' he said.

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia Appears Poised to Recognize China</HEAD>

   China's foreign minister left today for Saudi
Arabia, where diplomats said the two nations would announce the
establishment of diplomatic relations over the weekend.
   Winning recognition from Saudi Arabia would be a diplomatic
triumph for Beijing, which has seen a sharp drop in exchanges with
Western nations since it used its army to crush pro-democracy
demonstrations in June of 1989.
   China has diplomatic relations with most other Arab nations,
including the conservative states of Oman, Kuwait and Qatar. It has
been eager to establish formal ties with Saudi Arabia, with which
it already has trade links.
   Trade between Saudi Arabia and China totaled $319 million in
1989. China exported $249 million in goods, mainly textiles, light
industrial products and food, and imported $70 million worth of
goods including chemical fertilizer, wheat and steel.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported without explanation
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's departure for Saudi Arabia today. It
said he would also visit Cyprus, Morocco and Algeria.
   Diplomats in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, said the establishing of
ties would be announced at a ceremony on Saturday or Sunday. The
diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity.
   There has been a flurry of recent contact between the two
countries, including a visit to Beijing last week by Saudi Prince
Bandar Bin Sultan.
   The first indication that a change in Sino-Saudi relations was
in the works came in 1988, when it was disclosed that Beijing had
sold intermediate-range ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia.
   The granting of Saudi recognition to Beijing would be a blow to
the rival Nationalist government in Taiwan. Saudi Arabia is one of
only 28 nations that recognizes Taiwan. Most of the others are
smaller nations in Africa and Latin America.
   Indonesia this month announced plans to normalize relations with
China after a 23-year suspension.
   The Taiwan government has apparently been advised of Saudi
intentions.
   A Nationalist official said Wednesday that Saudi Arabia's King
Fahd had sent word of his plan to make ``certain adjustments'' in
Riyadh's relations with Taiwan and the mainland.
   The Nationalist official, Vice Foreign Minister Chen Chien-jen,
refused to disclose the exact contents of the letter, but it was
believed to express Saudi Arabia's plan to switch recognition.
   The Nationalists lost a civil war on the mainland in 1949 and
fled to the island province of Taiwan, but continue to maintain
that they are China's legitimate rulers.

<HEAD>Judge Drops Federal Charges Against Woman in Drug Cult Slayings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge has dismissed federal charges against
a woman who investigators call the high priestess of a drug cult
that sacrificed 15 people, but she remains in jail facing state
charges, her lawyer says.
   Federal Criminal Court Judge Bernardo Tirado dismissed charges
of homicide, resisting arrest and causing injuries to others that
were filed against Sara Maria Aldrete Villareal, 25, a former
honors student at Texas Southmost College in Brownsville, her
attorney, Horacio Moyar Quintanilla, said Wednesday.
   She also had faced a fourth federal charge of criminal
association. The judge ruled that Ms. Aldrete, who has been jailed
since her arrest in May 1989, would not have to face any further
penalties regarding that charge, which carries a sentence of six
months to six years in prison, Moyar said.
   Court officials were not available for comment late Wednesday on
the judge's ruling.
   On Tuesday, federal prosecutors had recommended dropping the
charges of homicide, resisting arrest and causing injuries to
others.
   The federal charges stem from the May 6 shootout in Mexico City
in which Ms. Aldrete and four other cult members were arrested and
the cult's alleged ringleader, Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, and his
bodyguard were shot to death.
   Prosecutors said Ms. Aldrete and Constanzo and other cult
members had made a pact to kill each other rather than face arrest.
They said she encouraged a fellow cult member to shoot Constanzo
and his bodyguard as police closed in on their hideout.
   The judge's ruling clears the way for Ms. Aldrete to be
transferred from a federal prison in Mexico City to a state prison
in Matamoros, Moyar said in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press.
   She is expected to go on trial next week in Matamoros, where she
faces Tamulipas state charges including homicide, drug trafficking
and secretly burying people, Moyar said. Mexico does not have the
death penalty. She faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison.
   Moyar said he would fight transfering Ms. Aldrete to the
Matamoros prison because he feared for his client's safety.
   ``She doesn't want to go,'' he said. ``It's dangerous there.
There are problems with the families of victims.''
   He also said he would seek to get the state charges dropped.
   Ms. Aldrete has maintained her innocence and denied that she had
anything to do with the ritual slayings of 15 people, including
Mark Kilroy, a 21-year-old University of Texas student whose
mutilated body was found buried at a ranch near Matamoros across
the border from Brownsville, Texas, in April 1989.
   Mexican investigators have described Ms. Aldrete as a ``witch''
involved in a Mexican drug cult that made human sacrifices.
   Authorities say Constanzo had overseen the ritual killings of
the 15 men and boys at the ranch near Matamoros in April, telling
members of his drug trafficking ring the deaths would give them
spiritual protection from police. Police say Ms. Aldrete took part
in at least one of the ritual killings, selecting the victim and
supervising his murder.

<HEAD>Tour Operators Accuse U.S. Of Pressuring Kenya</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tour operators, smarting from a drop in
business, have accused the United States of discouraging tourism in
an effort to pressure Kenya's one-party government to adopt
political reforms.
   A U.S. official denied the allegation, which stems from State
Department's advice to Americans on July 10 to postpone all
non-essential travel to the East African nation following riots
that left at least 28 people dead.
   Sam Mwaura, chairman of the Kenya Tour Operators Association,
told the government in a letter that ``it is our considered opinion
that tourism is now being used to put pressure to bear on the
government to achieve certain political objectives.''
   Kenyan politicians have accused the United States and embassy
officials in Nairobi of backing advocates of multiparty politics in
the one-party state.
   Tourism is Kenya's top foreign currency earner, bringing the
country $240 million in 1989. Last year, 713,800 tourists, mainly
from Europe, visited Kenya. Many of the tourists visit the nation's
game preserves.
   In his letter, Mwaura urged the Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife
to seek ways of persuading the State Department to withdraw its
travel advisory.
   Mwaura wrote the letter Tuesday, a day after association
executives met U.S. Embassy officials on the issue.
   An embassy spokesman denied the United States was pressuring the
Kenya government.
   ``The State Department issues travel advisories to help American
citizens make intelligent decisions. They are not a political
weapon.''
   The State Department revised the advisory today but advised
Americans to excercise caution when visiting Kenya.
   Mwaura said the State Department's warning also had led to
cancellations of bookings from several European countries and
Australia. He said a similar but ``fairly mild'' warning by the
British government had also contributed to those cancellations.
   Mwaura said one local company, which he did not identify, was
losing $100,000 daily in canceled bookings from the United States.
   The U.S. criticism of Kenya's government was stepped up ealier
this month when Kenya detained without trial or charge seven
advocates of multipary politics. Those detained indefinitely
include two former Cabinet ministers and the son of a former vice
president.
   The four days of riots began July 7 after police wielding wooden
clubs and firing tear gas dispersed a crowd attemping to hold a
pro-democracy rally a few blocks from downtown Nairobi.
   The violence spread into Nairobi suburbs, four other major towns
and several rural communities where rioters burned vehicles,
battled police with rocks and looted stores.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton was behind bars today as
part of his 15-day disorderly conduct sentence for a 1988 ``Day of
Outrage'' protest.
   Sharpton and the Rev. Timothy Mitchell were convicted at a
non-jury trial before state Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Flug.
Charges against 11 others were dismissed.
   They surrendered to authorities Wednesday afternoon and were
taken to jail where they were placed in maximum security,
protective custody, said Corrections spokeswoman Ruby Ryles.
   The protective status isolates them from the general prison
population. Ryles said they were given that status because of their
notoriety.
   Sharpton's 15-day sentence stems from a Jan. 27, 1988 ``Day of
Outrage'' rally during the Howard Beach racial attack trial.
Hundreds of protesters brought traffic around La Guardia Airport to
a standstill.
   With good behavior, the pair could be out in 10 days, Ryles said.

<TEXT>
   An emergency operator ignored a witness's
frantic call about an abduction that left a 19-year-old woman dead,
police said.
   Police were trying to determine whether the 911 operator's
failure to dispatch officers to the scene cost the victim her life,
said Police Chief Drew Diamond.
   A woman telephoned police Friday night about an accident she
witnessed in southeast Tulsa, Diamond said. A motorist left the
road, drove onto a sidewalk and struck a woman, identified as Tammy
Garret, authorities said.
   The witness told the 911 operator that the driver stopped and
put the woman inside the car.
   Ms. Garrett's body was found the next morning in a nearby field
along the Arkansas River. She was stabbed several times and her
throat slashed. Police believe she was killed in the field.
   Jack G. Lynch, 33, was arrested Tuesday and was held on a murder
charge, court records show.
   ``It should have gone out as a Priority One call,'' Diamond said
Wednesday at a news conference. ``This call was not, regrettably,
put into the system.''
   Diamond said the operator also failed to record the name of the
caller, who police believe may be the only witness to the
abduction. The caller volunteered her name but the operator said it
wasn't needed.
   Diamond would not speculate whether police dispatched to the
scene could have prevented Ms. Garrett's death, even though the
caller was able to provide the location, description of the
suspect's car and the vehicle's tag number.
   The information led to Lynch's arrest on Tuesday, said Lt. Jack
Putnam.
   ``There's just no way to tell,'' Diamond said. ``We've been
struggling with that question. We want to sleep, also.''
   The 911 operator, who Diamond refused to identify, resigned
Wednesday after being on the job for only 30 days.

<TEXT>
   Publisher Georges Dargaud, who launched the wildly
popular Tintin magazine and Asterix comic-book series, died after a
long illness, his publishing house announced today. He was 79.
   The spokeswoman for the publisher, Dargaud Editeur, did not
disclose the cause of Dargaud's death on Wednesday.
   Dargaud founded the publishing house in 1936 and took an active
role in its operation until selling it to the Media Participation
group in January 1989.
   In 1948, Dargaud began a 27-year relationship with the Belgian
artist Herge to publish Tintin magazine, in which the comic hero
and his faithful dog Milou narrated news and feature articles
written for young people.
   Dargaud launched Pilot magazine in 1960 and used it to introduce
such characters as the Gaul warrior Asterix and the lonesome cowboy
Lucky Luke, which were later spun off into films and hard-bound
books.
   The adventures of Asterix and his fellow tribesmen battling
Caesar's legions in Roman-era France are among the best-selling
comic series in France today.
   The publishing house sells 2 million copies of the 30 original
Asterix titles a year in 33 languages. A theme park based on
Asterix's village opened in northern France last year.
   Dargaud was an officer of the Legion of Honor of Arts and
Letters. He is survived by his wife, Irene, and daughter, Corinne.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

   A retired oilman shot to death his 61-year-old
daughter, a polio victim who used an iron lung, and then killed
himself, officials said.
   Ammy Harlin Drake, 94, opened Alta Jeanne Drake's iron lung,
shot her twice in the chest, returned to his lounge chair and shot
himself with a .32-caliber revolver early Tuesday, police said.
   Family caretaker Helen Jackson found the bodies Tuesday and
along with a note from Ammy Drake, detailing funeral arrangements.
   ``The (note) indicated he couldn't take care of her anymore and
that there was no one around to take care of her,'' said police
Capt. E.L. Holman.
   The Dallas County Medical Examiners Office ruled the death a
homicide-suicide.
   Relatives said Ms. Drake's health was failing and her father had
cancer. Those who knew Ms. Drake said her fear of being
institutionlized may have led her to devise the shooting.
   ``Jeanne may have made the decision (to die),'' said Ms. Drake's
cousin, Joeza Dailey. ``My cousin had a horror of being in an
institution, and she had no faith in any sort of help from the
state, or any sort of governmental help.''
   Paralyzed by polio, Ms. Drake has used an iron lung since 1951,
one year after she was graduated from Southern Methodist
University. She had married six months earlier. Her husband left
her in 1956; her mother died in 1973.

<HEAD>Lithuania Approves Universal Service Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Lithuanian parliament has approved a
compulsory service law for the Baltic republic's young men, a
spokesman said today.
   The law may lead to increased tensions between the republic and
the central Soviet government, which carries out a military draft.
   The Lithuanian law will require a year of mandatory service in
civilian work units for young men between the ages of 19 and 26.
They could also elect to undergo the military training that many
high school and college students now receive as part of the
standard Soviet education system.
   Simas Ardziunas, a representative of the parliament's
information bureau, said in an interview that some deputies who
voted against the law when it was approved Tuesday argued that it
could lead to the creation of a Lithuanian army. The vote in the
Supreme Council was 68-16 with 22 deputies abstaining.
   Ardziunas said the law does not go into effect until the
government can issue a directive including all the details of
service. No barracks or camps yet exist for the force, he said.
   ``The law says nothing about any weapons,'' Ardziunas added.
   Youths serving in the force would be available for service along
the border and in case of natural disasters, he said.
   Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union on
March 11 and for months has been embroiled in a dispute with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev about it.
   Gorbachev slapped a tough economic embargo on the republic.
   On June 29, the Supreme Council voted to place a moratorium on
the declaration, to take effect when talks with Soviet officials
begin on independence. Soviet officials immediately began lifting
the embargo.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Financier Skewed Results of Telephone Poll on Trump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cincinnati financier Carl H. Lindner Jr.
skewed results of a call-in telephone poll on Donald Trump
conducted for USA Today, the newspaper said today.
   The newspaper said an independent analysis of the call-in
results to a ``Trump hot line'' from June 8 through June 10 showed
that 5,640 of 7,802 calls came from two phone numbers at Great
American Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Lindner's American
Financial Corp.
   Lindner would not comment, the newspaper said, but a spokeswoman
for him said the calls were made because Lindner and others at the
company admire Trump's ``entrepreneurial spirit.''
   The newspaper said it studied phone records generated by Airdata
Inc., a call-in service company, because of some apparent
last-minute ballot-stuffing. From 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. EDT on June 10,
the final hour of the three-day call-in period, more than 1,000
calls poured in. Ninety-three percent of those calls were
pro-Trump, the newspaper said.
   Callers were asked to say which statement they agreed with:
``Donald Trump symbolizes what makes the USA a great country`` or
``Donald Trump symbolizes the things that are wrong with this
country.''
   Trump won in a ``landslide,'' the newspaper said, with 5,215, or
81 percent, agreeing with the first statement despite Trump's
recent financial and marital problems.
   The second statement got 1,191 votes, or 19 percent of the 6,406
callers who cast votes, the newspapers said.
   The newspaper quoted a statement from the Lindner organization
that said Trump was an example of the entrepreneurial spirit that
builds businesses and creates jobs. ``We feel that the intent of
this survey seemed to have been to have a good laugh at someone's
misfortune,'' the statement said.
   The newspaper called such surveys ``strictly for fun'' and
``unscientific.''
   It added that it would take steps to prevent such skewed results
in the future, while guaranteeing callers' privacy.

   Sponsors of a bill to combat job bias, fresh
from victory in the Senate, say they would welcome a compromise to
ease White House concern that the plan could lead to hiring quotas.
   ``We'll continue to consider any proposals from the president,''
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the chief sponsor, said Wednesday
night after the Senate approved the measure, 65-34. ``But we're not
going to sacrifice the essential principles of this legislation.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with
President Bush in Anaheim, Calif., said the administration was
disappointed by the outcome of the Senate's vote.
   ``We'll work to change it in the House,'' Fitzwater said. ``We
still want a bill we can sign.''
   Fitzwater later issued a statement saying that the ``president
wants a bill that ends discrimination, not one that starts a quota
system.''
   In San Antonio, Vice President Dan Quayle told reporters today,
``The administration is not going to have a quota bill crammed down
its throat disguised as a civil rights bill. This is a quota bill,
pure and simple.''
   The bill is the top legislative priority of the civil rights
movement. It would effectively overturn five Supreme Court
decisions on job discrimination handed down last year.
   While Kennedy said he would ``welcome the president's support,''
he also said the margin of victory suggested that it would be
possible to override a veto if Bush refused to sign.
   Ten Republicans joined 55 Democrats in propelling the measure
through the Senate, while 34 GOP senators voted against the bill.
   The House Judiciary Committee is expected to start work within
days on its version of the legislation, whose provisions range from
a ban on racial harassment in the workplace to punitive damages for
victims of the worst kinds of employment discrimination.
   The sharpest clashes, however, have come over a provision that
would make it easier to challenge employment practices whose
negative effects fall disproportionately on minority groups.
   The Supreme Court's decision last year in a case involving a
salmon cannery in Alaska said such practices do not violate the law
unless those filing suit can show they were not prompted by
business necessity.
   The bill would require the companies challenged in such suits to
prove that the practices in question were justified by business
necessity. The provision is similar to the law as it was before the
high court decision.
   The administration, some Republican senators and business groups
contend that the bill's definition of business necessity, combined
with possible punitive damages that would frighten lawyers, would
lead to quotas.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., told the Senate that corporate
lawyers would look for ways to insulate their companies from the
danger of such suits and tell executives: ``Better make certain
that your percentage of the workforce matches the percentage of
available applicants.''
   Kennedy maintained throughout the debate that the bill would not
lead to quotas. He said experience before the Supreme Court's
decision proved it.
   ``The false hue and cry of quotas is a disservice to the
president of the United States, a disreputable tactic by those who
don't care about civil rights for women and minorities,'' Kennedy
said.
   But he negotiated with White House chief of staff John Sununu
for weeks in an effort to alleviate administration concerns. The
last bargaining session broke up at midnight Tuesday.
   Even then, Bush sent three Republican senators from the White
House to Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning with a fresh proposal.
It failed to galvanize sufficient support.
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., said the hangup remained the
definition of ``business necessity.'' He said ``every combination
of words has been tried.''
   ``We are now proceeding on the road to a certain veto,''
Danforth said. ``This is a bill that can do a lot of good for a lot
of people and it is going nowhere.''
   Tempers frayed on the Senate floor Wednesday night. Republican
leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said he had never before voted against
civil rights legislation but that this measure was being ``rammed
down my throat.''
   He made it clear he was still upset that Democratic sponsors won
a time limit on debate before it began, which gave Republicans
little time to present amendments.
   In retaliation, Dole used a tactical move to bar moderate
Democrats from attaching some politically sensitive amendments they
had wanted, including a cap on punitive damages that had been
sought as a way of easing concerns among small businesses.

<HEAD>Iraq's Parliament Proposes Presidency For Life for Saddam Hussein</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's parliament has approved a plan to
make Saddam Hussein the president for life and scrap planned
elections, Iraq's official news agency reported today.
   Saddam has been tightening his grip on power while establishing
himself as one of the Arab world's most ruthless rulers.
   The 250-member assembly, dominated by Saddam's Baath Party,
approved the president-for-life proposal at a three-day session on
planned constitutional changes, according to the official Iraqi
News Agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   The session ended Wednesday, but it was not clear from the
report whether the measures were binding or the vote final. No
details were provided about the proposals.
   Saddam, 54, had promised political reforms _ including a
multiparty system and a free press _ following the August 1988
cease-fire in the eight-year war with Iran. But today's report said
lawmakers had altered a proposal that would have provided for
Iraq's first elections since it became a republic in 1958.
   Saddam had said he would run in the election _ whose date had
never been set _ but no one had come forth to challenge him.
   Under the current constitution, the president is elected by the
10-member Revolutionary Command Council composed of senior
officials of the Baath Party.
   The current constitution was drawn up in 1968 when the party
seized power in a coup. Saddam has ruled with an iron fist since
July 1979, when he took over as president from Gen. Ahmed al Bakr.
   A final draft of the new constitution is to be drawn up by the
Baath Party and the 10-man Revolutionary Command Council headed by
Saddam.
   Saddam exercises near-total rule over Iraq's 17 million people
through his vast security apparatus. The inner circle of Iraq's
leadership is packed with Saddam's relatives, by blood or marriage,
from his extended clan from Takrit in northern Iraq.
   The Baath Party is ostensibly socialist and pan-Arab but is now
virtually devoid of any ideology beyond Saddam's policies.
   Saddam has turned his reign into a personality cult that has
reached the realms of near-mythology. Photos and posters of him are
everywhere. It is a capital offense to insult him publicly.
   Iraqi dissident sources have claimed in recent weeks that as
many as 40 senior military figures, including a cousin of Saddam,
have been arrested and probably executed in Saddam's latest purge.
There has been no independent confirmation of the reports.
   Since the cease-fire in the war with Iran, Saddam has revived
his ambitions to become the paramount leader of the Arab world and
has built up an arsenal of long-range missiles and chemical weapons
that has drawn denunciations from the West and Israel.
   He has also taken a belligerent stand against violators of
production quotas set by the Organization of Petroleu Exporting
Nations.
   This week Saddam threatened to retaliate against Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates with force for violating production quotas,
saying they were responsible for driving down prices and costing
Iraq $14 billion in lost revenues in the last year.
   Saddam accused quota violators of stabbing Iraq in the back
``with a poisoned dagger.''

   Angry non-Communist Cambodian
guerrillas say the withdrawal of U.S. recognition, though intended
to spur a peaceful settlement, could force them closer to China and
strengthen the Khmer Rouge.
   China indicated today that it had no intention of joining the
United States in changing who it recognizes and would continue
aiding the Khmer Rouge, the strongest fighting force in the
three-party resistance coalition.
   Cambodia's government, along with its Vietnamese backers,
welcomed the U.S. move, but Indonesia and Thailand said it would
not weaken the Khmer Rouge.
   Cambodia described the U.S. action as ``paving the way for
achievement of an early political settlement,'' the nation's
official SPK news agency said.
   In Wasington, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, called for an end to covert U.S. aid to
Cambodia's rebel coalition.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Wednesday
that ``there is simply no excuse to delay additional action'' that
would go beyond the Bush administration announcement.
   But resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk called the U.S.
move ``an act of very serious injustice'' and appealed to all
governments to keep Washington from trying to strip the coalition
of Cambodia's seat in the United Nations.
   The coalition will now be ``more firm and fierce in their
determination to continue to resist,'' he said in a statement from
North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, where he lives part of the year.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978, ending a four-year reign of
terror by a Khmer Rouge government that tried to force a radical
agrarian commune on the population, killing hundreds of thousands
of people.
   The government it installed has been battling insurgents for 11
years. The war has widened in recent months, with the Khmer Rouge
scoring victories.
   Reflecting fears of a Khmer Rouge takeover, the Bush
administration announced Wednesday that it was withdrawing
recognition of the resistance coalition and opening a dialogue with
Vietnam on resolving the war.
   Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, said his country
was ready to negotiate ``with concerned countries'' on Cambodia,
the official Vietnam News Agency reported today. The Cambodian
government's SPK news agency reported the U.S. move without comment
today.
   Cambodian peace talks have foundered, with the guerrilla
coalition rejecting the wish of the Hanoi-backed government of
Prime Minister Hun Sen to remain in power during a transitional
period before elections.
   The guerrillas want to share power or have the United Nations
assume authority _ and Sihanouk and the head of the third rebel
faction, former Prime Minister Son Sann, have refused to abandon
the Khmer Rouge.
   They say the Khmer Rouge would only fight on if left out of a
settlement.
   Sihanouk said the U.S. move will only perpetuate the rule of a
government that is ``a creature and creation'' of Vietnam.
   The Vietnamese claim they withdrew all their troops in
September, but there is evidence Vietnamese soldiers remain and are
supporting government forces against the rebels.
   In Beijing today, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua said all
Cambodian factions must be included in any politicial settlement.
   ``So long as Vietnam does not withdraw all its troops from
Cambodia genuinely, China will continue to support the Cambodian
people in their resistance against the foreign invaders,'' he told
a news conference.
   Jin did not specificially mention Chinese aid to the communist
Khmer Rouge, but China is known to be their main weapons supplier.
   He refused to answer questions about whether the U.S. change in
policy would prompt Beijing to increase aid to the Khmer Rouge.
   There was no immediate indication of whether Washington intends
to cut its non-lethal and covert military aid to the non-communist
factions.
   A Thai analyst involved in the aid program said the U.S.
decision will affect the Khmer Rouge politically but not militarily
``and might push them to concentrate on a military solution.'' The
official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas, said in Jakarta that
the six Southeast Asian countries involved in the Cambodia peace
process had been informed in advance of the U.S. move but were
doubtful it would lead to peace.
   The Khmer Rouge's 30,000-member army is reported to have struck
in virtually every province in Cambodia in an unprecedented
escalation of the war, attacking five provincial capitals in the
south, north and west in recent weeks.

   The government said today it has evidence
about cocaine use by one of Marion Barry's security guards, a city
police officer who was the leadoff witness for the defense in the
mayor's drug and perjury trial.
   Assistant U.S. attorney Judith Retchin said she wants to
question police Sgt. James Stays, a member of the mayor's security
detail, ``about his involvement with cocaine and Mr. Barry.'' Her
comments came in court with the jury out of the room.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said legal
counsel should be appointed for Stays and that prosecutors could
question the security officer about the alleged drug use.
   Barry attorney R. Kenneth Mundy said prosecutors should not be
allowed to question Stays about alleged drug use, but the judge
overruled Mundy's objection.
   The defense had called Stays as its first witness. Before his
testimony was interrupted, the 29-year police veteran contradicted
minor points in the testimony of two government witnesses.
   ``The witness has used cocaine on an occasion within the statute
of limitations,'' said Retchin after her cross-examination of Stays
and after the jury had been sent out of the courtroom.
   The issue of Stays' alleged cocaine use came up after he
testified that he knew Willie Davis. Government witnesses have
testified that Davis used cocaine with the mayor.
   Davis, a former aide to Birmingham, Ala., mayor Richard
Arrington, has not been called to testify in the case.
   After Stays told the court he knew Davis, Retchin asked him if
he had told another security officer that Davis ``provides Mr.
Barry with cocaine.''
   ``Me?'' replied Stays. ``No.''
   The jury was then sent out of the courtroom so that Retchin and
Mundy could argue about further questioning of Stays.
   Earlier, the judge denied the last of the defense's motions for
acquittal, including the one stemming from an FBI sting operation
in which the mayor was videotaped smoking crack cocaine.
   In addition to the charge stemming from the sting, Jackson let
stand a conspiracy charge and two cocaine possession charges. One
Wednesday, he rejected motions for acquittal on the other 10
charges drug and perjury charges against the mayor.
   Barry's lawyers had said he was entrapped in the videotaped
sting operation. They also said the government had failed to prove
there was a single conspiracy involving the mayor and that
witnesses had failed to substantiate the dates of the two cocaine
possession charges.
   The judge said court rulings did not support Barry's position on
the entrapment question.
   Jackson also said there were a series of interlocking
conspiracies, with Barry at the hub. He said the courts give leeway
to the government by not requiring it in all cases to prove precise
dates on which crimes were committed.
   The prosecution ended its case Wednesday with testimony from a
city police detective that Barry made more than 2,000 calls on his
car phone to people who supplied him with drugs.
   The detective said the calls were made in a four-year span
starting in 1986.
   In 4{ weeks of testimony, 10 prosecution witnesses testified
that Barry snorted cocaine and smoked crack, opium and marijuana
about 200 times from 1983 to this year.
   Barry has pleaded innocent to the single conspiracy charge, 10
counts of cocaine possession and three felony charges of lying to a
federal grand jury.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Sentences Two in Phone-Tapping of NY Times Bureau</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court has upheld the conviction
of the publisher and the former managing editor of a leading Greek
daily in the phone-tapping of The New York Times' bureau in Athens,
a court spokesman said today.
   The three-member court sentenced the two men to 20 days in jail,
but they were permitted to avoid imprisonment by paying a fine, the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity. The amount of the fine
was not disclosed.
   Under Greek law, people convicted in cases not related to
narcotics may pay to reduce or eliminate their prison terms if the
terms are less than 18 months.
   The decision upheld the conviction of Ethnos publisher George
Bobolas and former Managing Editor Alekos Filippopoulos in May
1985, the spokesman said.
   Bobolas, 63, and Filippopoulos, 60, were found guilty of
providing the former socialist government of Premier Andreas
Papandreou with tapes of conversations tapped at the home and
office of a journalist working for the New York Times and Daily
Telegraph of London in July 1983.
   Greek-Cypriot journalist Paul Anastasi took legal action when
Ethnos published his conversations with a lawyer a week later. In a
separate story, the paper alleged that the conversations were coded
and actually referred to a plot designed to overthrow the socialist
government.
   The appeals court convened last week to determine the final
sentence but their decision was made known today, the court
spokesman said.
   Anastasi and the Ethnos newspaper have been in court in a series
of related trials since 1983, following the journalist's
publication of his book called ``Take The Nation In Your Hands.''
The book alleged that Ethnos was launched to promote Soviet
propaganda and disinformation in Greece.
   Anastasi was sentenced to one year in jail for libel and was
allowed to buy off his prison sentence. But he never withdrew his
allegations.
   Bobolas, Filippopoulos and three senior Ethnos editors are to
stand trial on charges of defaming and libeling Anastasi and of
perjury in connection with the phone-tapping case. If found guilty
of perjury, the accused could be banned from journalism and
publishing.

<HEAD>FDA Holding Up Generic Drug Applications from Pittsburgh Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said today it
is holding up applications for approval of generic drugs tested by
a Pittsburgh lab whose work has been found by the agency to be
flawed.
   Pending applications based on the testing of Biodecision
Laboratories Inc. were put on hold while the FDA continues its
review of the results of an inspection of the lab, said FDA
spokesman Jeff Nesbit.
   The FDA's inspection, in which 13 studies conducted by the lab
on candidate generic drugs were reviewed, found that all but two
violated FDA regulations or fell short of accepted laboratory
practice.
   The findings of the inspection, conducted last October through
January, were released earlier this week. Biodecision is one of the
nation's largest independent testing labs.
   The studies were to determine whether the candidate generic drug
worked the same as the patented drug for which it would be sold as
a substitute. A generic drug must be shown to be ``bioequivalent''
to a name-brand drug before it can win FDA approval.
   Nesbit said seven of the 11 drugs in which Biodecision's studies
were flawed are not currently being sold. The remaining four are
antibiotics, for which a broad potency range is acceptable.
   Nesbit said he did not know how many generic drug applications
were being held up.
   Biodecision President Robert Lecher was quoted in The Pittsburgh
Press as saying the laboratory has confirmed the findings of the 11
tests questioned by the FDA.
   Lecher said the re-evaluations were part of the lab's efforts to
work with the FDA to correct problems found in the inspection. The
lab has corrected all but one of the deficiencies cited in the
inspection, he said.

   Rep. Lindy Boggs reportedly will not seek
re-election to the congressional seat she and her late husband have
held for 46 years.
   Mrs. Boggs, 74, was expected to announce her decision Friday.
   She has been under increasing emotional and physical strain
because of the illness of her elder daughter, Barbara Sigmund,
friends of the family say. The daughter, mayor of Princeton, N.J.,
is suffering from cancer.
   The Washington office of the Louisiana Democrat refused today to
comment on the reports in the New Orleans media. Earlier this week,
Mrs. Boggs said, ``When I make up my mind positively, I'll
certainly let everyone know.''
   She assumed the post in March 1973 after winning a special
election to succeed her husband, the powerful House majority
leader, whose plane disappeared during a flight over Alaska six
months earlier.
   The primary election for the 2nd Congressional District _ which
encompasses most of New Orleans, will be Oct. 6. A runoff, if
needed, would be Nov. 6.

   Women could volunteer for service in the Italian
military, one of the last all-male armed forces in Europe, under
legislation approved by a parliamentary committee.
   The bill passed Wednesday by the Defense Committee of the Senate
also would reduce the draft for men from 12 months to 10 months and
offer alternative service in such fields as civil defense and
environmental protection.
   Increasing numbers of Italian women have been joining the police
forces in recent years, but the armed forces have remained closed
to them. Elsewhere in Europe, women have joined the military in
many countries.
   The bill would open up the Italian services to women as
volunteers and offer careers to them as officers and
non-commissioned officers but would exclude them from combat roles.
   The bill must go before the full Senate and then to the Chamber
of Deputies.

   A chain smoker may be addicted, but
cigarettes are not drugs, according to the Swiss Supreme Court.
   The Federal Tribunal's ruling upheld a lower court which ordered
a health insurance company to pay $12,850 in sick benefits to a
heavy smoker who had fallen ill.
   The insurers had refused payment, arguing that their contract
did not provide for sick-benefit money for illnesses caused by
abusive use of drugs or medicines.
   In the ruling published Thursday, the Federal Tribunal said
while smoking may lead to addiction, cigarettes cannot be legally
categorized as drugs.

   Notices appeared in English-language and Arabic newspapers
cautioning that writing on a banknote could cancel its monetary

   The bank said Oman had introduced security measures in banknote

   But it said: ``It has been observed for some time that there is
an increasing trend among the public to write on banknotes _
telephone numbers, names, verses of poetry or even indecent

   The bank statement noted that the designs and words of the notes

   ``Keeping our banknotes in a good condition is a national duty,
observance of which indicates our civilized attitudes and
behavior,'' the statement added. The Omani rial is currently worth

   Six-year-old Vanessa Moretti left her dying father
in the car along a busy highway and dashed away for help.
   She ran a mile along a guard rail, falling and scratching her
arms on branches, desperately seeking aid from scores of
vacation-bound travelers speeding past. No one stopped.
   The little girl's case has startled Italians and prompted some
columnists to speculate about whether their country is losing its
soul as it accumulates ever greater wealth.
   ``We have begun to show the cold, glacial face that even a few
years ago we reproached other, richer countries for having,''
columnist Sabino Acquaviva said in the Milan-based daily Corriere
della Sera.
   The incident last Saturday drew particular outrage because it
occurred along the ``Sun Highway'' near the western coast that
thousands of Italians were traveling for the start of their
vacations.
   Several newspapers said vacationers were so intent on reaching
the beach they ignored a desperate child on the side of the highway.
   ``The weekend of mass exodus, of the big departure of the army
of vacationers, opened with a tragedy made even more bitter by an
incredible cynicism,'' the Turin-based La Stampa said.
   The little girl finally succeeded in stopping a motorist, who
alerted highway police.
   But it was too late to save her father, 34-year-old Marco
Moretti, who had died of a heart attack while driving his daughter
to the beach at Monte Argentario in central Italy.
   ``The `Beautiful Country' doesn't exist anymore: the days of
spaghetti and guitars, of courtesy and sweetness, are over,''
Acquaviva wrote.
   ``Because we have inculcated in people the philosophy of
well-being, we have created egoists, consumers, people who
ultimately are alone and unhappy.''
   The case reflected the unease felt by some Italians over the
changes in their country as it has become wealthy during eight
years of uninterrupted economic growth.
   Italians who lived in poverty just four decades ago have enjoyed
a consumer boom, donning designer clothes, buying bigger cars and
taking exotic vacations in places like Indonesia and Mauritius.
   In real terms, Italians spent three times as much in 1988 for
television sets and other recreational equipment as they did in
1971, according to the government statistics institute ISTAT.
   Some people have expressed concern that Italians have become
selfish and indifferent to others as they have grown wealthier.
   ``The average citizen ... ever more frequently lives involved in
and absorbed by his own problems, interests and affairs, immersed
almost exclusively in his own world,'' the respected Rome-based
think-tank Censis said in a report released last December.

   A federal grand jury subpoenaed campaign
records for all 124 state representatives in connection with an FBI
sting in which lawmakers were allegedly offered cash for votes,
according to legislators and media reports today.
   A lobbyist allegedly paid cash to about 30 lawmakers in exchange
for votes on an unidentified issue, The Greenville News and WBTW-TV
in Florence reported, citing unidentified sources.
   An attorney who said he was approached by several lawmakers
because of the probe said, in the alleged sting operation, a fake
lobbyist offered money to lawmakers in exchange for legislative
favors. The attorney requested anonymity.
   The House Ethics Committee received the subpoena Wednesday for
the financial disclosure forms for all House members going back to
1988, said the committee's chairman, Rep. Pat Harris.
   U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel refused to comment on the subpoenas.
   ``We can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any federal
grand jury investigation,'' Daniel said Wednesday night.
   Several lawmakers, including one senator, said they were
individually served subpoenas. Many said they were surprised and
puzzled by the order.
   House Speaker Bob Sheheen said that two House members told him
FBI agents that visited the lawmakers wanted to know if cash
contributions were made to their campaigns.
   ``They wanted to know whether those contributions were deposited
in their camapaign accounts,'' Sheheen said.
   The investigation apparently involves possible violations of the
Hobbs Act, a federal anti-corruption law that prohibits
legislators' acceptance of money or gifts in return for promised
performance, said an attorney who spoke on conditin of anonymity.

   Federal railroad officials are predicting a
new era in ground transportation where trains that zip over a
magnetic field at 300 mph can compete with air travel.
   At least two magnetic levitation trains, or ``maglevs,'' will be
running in the United States before the end of the 1990s, Federal
Railroad Administrator Gilbert E. Carmichael predicted. His agency
this week released a report on the technology.
   In addition, Carmichael said, two or three high-speed rail,
steel-on-steel systems could be built.
   The report said magnetically levitated trains that float along
at three-eighths of an inch or more from a magnetized rail are
feasible for the United States even without significant federal
funding.
   With planning for such systems moving ahead in California,
Nevada, Florida, Texas and Pennsylvania, Carmichael said it is
still possible for the U.S. to take the lead in a technology on
which the Germans and Japanese already have each spent $1 billion
to develop.
   The German and Japanese systems operate differently than that
proposed for the U.S., with the Japanese train riding several
inches above a stronger magnetic field.
   The fiscal 1992 federal budget so far includes $12 million to
study high-speed trains.
   Congress failed to act last year on a Senate committee study
that recommended $750 million over six years to develop a U.S.
maglev technology.
   But there are signs of growing private interest in magnetic
trains:
   _ On Monday, a partnership headed by Bechtel International Inc.
of San Francisco put up $500,000 for the right to bid on a $5
billion maglev train between Southern California and Las Vegas.
Planners hope to have the train running in seven years.
   _ Business and government leaders in Pittsburgh are moving to
make the city a technological and manufacturing base for the
German-developed system, while developing a 19-mile demonstration
run between downtown Pittsburgh and the city's airport.
   _ A privately funded project in Florida is planning to build a
14-mile German system by 1994 to link Orlando Airport to Disney
World and other nearby resorts.
   _ At least two companies are bidding to develop a high-speed
rail system in Texas to link Houston and Dallas.
   Magnetic trains do not yet carries paying passengers anywhere in
the world, but the Carmichael described a recent ride on a 19-mile
test system in West Germany.
   ``You feel it levitate, and then you feel it swoosh you along
without any vibration,'' Carmichael said. ``Cows were grazing
underneath when we passed over, and they didn't even look up.''
   Because the trains float on a powerful magnetic field, there is
no friction or wear and far less energy is consumed. It takes about
as much electricity to run the German system as to aircondition it,
Carmichael said, and the only pollution comes from producing the
electricity.
   Usual fares would be about 20 percent below air fares and 40
percent lower on some shorter routes, Carmichael said. In some
cases, trips between major city centers would be faster than by
plane, since downtown stations would be used.
   The report said the United States started and then abandoned the
``maglev'' technology two decades ago and now faces the prospect of
buying guideways and trains from West Germany or Japan.
   Maglev technologies are in competition with high-speed rail,
which is a fast train that runs on special tracks, and with Swedish
tilting trains that allow faster service on existing tracks without
passengers feeling the curves.
   The maglev system is expensive _ about $30 million a mile on
routes that could carry trains simultaneously in both directions.
But the FRA report said costs could be offset by savings in highway
and airport construction, pollution control, reduced travel delays
and in the increased commerce the system would attract.

   Robert L. Charlebois, who sang in major
opera houses of Europe in the 1950s and early 1960s, has died after
a long illness. He was 67.
   Charlebois, who grew up in Minneapolis, died Saturday at his
home in St. Paul. He had suffered a stroke on Jan. 2.
   After serving in the Army during World War II, Charlebois stayed
on as entertainment director for U.S. troops in Munich, West
Germany.
   He studied with Fritz Wolff at the Munich School of Music. He
was chosen by Wieland Wagner, grandson of the composer, to sing the
title role of ``Parsifal'' at the Bayreuth Festival in 1951.
   Charlebois also sang in major opera houses in Austria, France,
Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Spain and Portugal. At a command
performance for Queen Elizabeth II at the Royal Opera House in
London, he sang Sigmund in Wagner's ``Die Walkure.''
   In 1965, he ripped a vocal cord singing ``Tannhauser,'' ending
his singing career.
   Survivors include two sons, a sister and four grandsons.
   Services will be Monday at Fort Snelling National Cemetery.

<TEXT>
   Tommy Harris, a restaurateur, city parks
commissioner and former radio personality once known as the
``Little King of Song,'' died after a brief bout with leukemia. He
was 78.
   Harris, who died Wednesday, was the founder and longtime owner
of Tommy's Joynt, a landmark saloon known for gaudy murals covering
its facade as well as its buffalo stew.
   Harris first became known in San Francisco as a radio
entertainer; in the mid-1930s he was known as the ``Little King of
Song'' on the NBC network.
   He started in vaudeville at 17, after dropping out of high
school, and performed with his own dance band on a cruise vessel.
   Later, he ran night clubs before establishing Tommy's Joynt in
1951.
   In 1971, Harris was appointed to the city Recreation and Parks
Commission by then-mayor Joseph L. Alioto. He remained in the post
until his death.
   He is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter.

   The captain of United Flight 232 said
today his reunion with the survivors of the cartwheeling crash has
been very emotional and he reluctantly accepts being called a hero.
   More than 100 of the 184 survivors were attending a daylong
reunion, one year after the July 19, 1989 crash that killed 112
people. Several relatives of the dead were expected at an afternoon
prayer service.
   ``To be able to talk it out and to talk it through with them _
it's been very fulfilling,'' United Air Lines Capt. Al C. Haynes
said at a news conference.
   Haynes said there were no heroes among the crew that guided the
crippled DC-10 jetliner to the Sioux Gateway Airport. But he said
some people needed to look up to the crew as part of their healing.
   ``If we are serving some kind of function by being called
heroes, so be it,'' Haynes said. ``I'd like to think that any other
well-trained crew would have responded as we did.''
   Several passengers arriving late Wednesday sought out Haynes,
who managed to fly the plane after its flight controls were severed
by an engine explosion. The jumbo jet cartwheeled in flames on
landing at Sioux Gateway Airport.
   Haynes said today he would not ever get over the crash, ``but
I'm well through it. I'm well on to other things.''
   ``I think about it every day, but I've never had nightmares,''
Haynes said. ``I don't dwell on it.''
   Several survivors and relatives of the victims visited the
airport Wednesday. Some left flowers at the perimeter.
   Some survivors attending the reunion flew for the first time
since the tragedy.
   ``You could feel the plane heat up with emotion as we came in
for a landing,'' said Becky Larson, who flew with crash survivors
on a United Air Lines flight from Denver late Wednesday.
   ``A lot of people said they hadn't flown since the crash and
some of them wouldn't look out the window. But I did. I wanted to
see it from the air,'' said Ms. Larson, a United flight attendant
who saw the crash from the ground and was among the first rescuers
on the scene.
   Survivor Mark Michaelson of Cincinnati said flying isn't routine
anymore.
   ``Takeoffs are difficult, landings are difficult, turbulence is
especially difficult,'' he said. ``Every once in a while when you
are in the clouds for an extended period of time and can't see
where you are going you get anxiety attacks.''
   Michaelson survived the crash with his wife, Lori, and their
daughter, Sabrina. Mrs. Michaelson since has campaigned for
mandatory child safety seats on commercial flights. Sabrina, then
1, was thrown from her mother's arms in the crash.
   Passengers and their families have been arriving all week for
the anniversary, said Linda Phillips, who is coordinating the event
for the local Chamber of Commerce.
   Phillips estimated 160 passengers and their families, and a few
relatives of those killed, planned to join the reunion at their own
expense.
   Phillips said Sioux City residents are proud of their rescue
efforts but that the reunion was not designed as a pat on the back
for the home crowd.
   ``We're doing it because we feel it needs to be done,'' she
said. ``They were coming back here at the anniversary whether we
did anything or not.''
   Emergency personnel had practiced responding to a nearly
identical calamity two years before the crash. After the crash,
residents offered food, transportation and even their homes to the
survivors, and hundreds lined up to give blood without anyone
putting out a call to do so.
   ``There are no heroes,'' said Shirley Brown, assistant city
manager. ``The people genuinely believe that they just did their
jobs that day. They did them well, they were coordinated and they
had rehearsed, but they simply did what they had practiced.''

<HEAD>High School Handbook Details Sexual Harassment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High schoolers who beam sexually charged
stares at classmates or exchange snippets of intimate gossip could
fall afoul of new guidelines to curb sexual harassment among
students.
   The rules are designed to make school a more comfortable place,
the principal said Thursday.
   ``We had an idea that we should have a clear statement in our
student handbook about sexual harassment,'' said Ilene Levitt,
principal of the Amherst-Pelham Regional High School.
   ``I think in 1970 people would have turned up their eyebrows.
This is 1990 and I think students understand.''
   Jason Bray, incoming senior class vice president, said some may
laugh at the handbook's detailed offenses, but he thinks it was a
good idea.
   Sexual harassment at the high school generally takes the form of
``little things,'' said Bray, 17. But hearty flirting by a ``macho
man'' can be upsetting, he said, ``especially to girls that aren't
popular and don't know these people. I'm sure it made them very
uneasy.''
   Another incoming senior, 17-year-old Jennifer Emery, said she
was surprised about the policy because she had never considered
sexual harassment a problem at the school.
   ``Plenty of people have given me strange looks and said strange
things to me but it's all been a joke,'' she said.
   At the National Association of Secondary School Principals,
spokeswoman Maryellen Parker said she had not heard of a high
school having a similar policy, but it is an issue the association
has promoted for some time.
   Sexual harassment ``is a widespread problem but it receives
little attention from administrators or teachers so it's good to
see that there are policies that are beginning to occur. It's long
overdue,'' Parker said in a telephone interview from Reston, Va.
   The policy, which has been approved in principle by school
officials, lists several behaviors that would qualify as sexual
harassment. Among them: staring or leering with sexual overtones,
spreading sexual gossip, making unwanted sexual comments, exerting
pressure for sexual activity and making unwanted physical contact
of a sexual nature.
   The guidelines will be printed in student handbooks this fall,
pending a few changes in language that do not affect the substance
of the draft, said School Committee Chairwoman Joan Hanson.
   ``It's something that several people have felt for a long
time,'' Hanson said. ``Times have changed.''
   While the focus is on students, the guidelines also point out
that sexual advances from adults at the school are not appropriate.
   Possible punishment includes a parent conference, apology to the
victim, detention, suspension, expulsion, and in cases of physical
assault, referral to police, Levitt said.
   The school probably will rely most heavily on the first two
avenues, she said.
   Levitt said it may be hard to make a determination on reports of
leers and gossip, but at the very least there will have been
discussion of the problem.
   ``We have a sense of humor, too,'' she said. ``There's certainly
sexual behavior that's appropriate among adolescents. We certainly
aren't Puritans.''

<HEAD>Proposals Call For Cut In U.S. Aid To Kenya</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two congressional proposals introduced
Thursday call for the United States to stop all aid to Kenya until
the African nation frees political prisoners and implements
democratic freedoms.
   ``Americans should not send these tax dollars to a government
that denies its citizens their basic rights,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., who authored Senate legislation.
   A companion measure was introduced in the House of
Representatives by Tom Lantos, a California Democrat.
   Neither chamber is expected to act before September, after a
summer recess.
   Congressional Democrats have criticized Kenyan President Daniel
Arap Moi. But the decision to propose the aid cut follows rioting
that began July 7 after police using clubs and tear gas dispersed a
crowd attempting to hold a pro-democracy rally in Nairobi.
   Twenty eight people were killed in the four days of disturbance
and seven democracy advocates _ including two former government
officials _ were detained without trial.
   Amnesty International said Thursday that it had learned of the
arrest of eight additional government critics since then. The
London-based human rights organization warned about the ``alarming
deterioration of the rule of law in Kenya'' and ``the harsh
conditions under which political prisoners are held.''
   Kenya is the largest recipient of U.S. aid to sub-Saharan
Africa. This year it was scheduled to receive $46 million,
including $11 million in military assistance. For next year, the
Bush administration has asked Congress to give Kenya $42 million,
$16 million of which is for the military.
   But Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., chairman of the Senate subcommittee
on Africa, said he had frozen some $13 million of this year's aid.
   He said Kenya's President Daniel Arap Moi was heavily dependent
on foreign aid and loans, which comprise 27 percent of his
government's annual budget.
   ``The only language he (Moi) understands is that of aid,'' said
Gibson Kuria, a prominent dissident who sought refuge last month in
the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi and was allowed to leave the country.
   Kuria said Moi was in a ``panic'' because of growing pressure to
legalize political parties.
   A letter from Coretta Scott King, Jesse Jackson and other
prominent blacks made public during the news conference calls on
the administration to cut all aid to Moi's government.
   Kenya has been a U.S. favorite in Africa for many years,
eschewing socialism even when its neighbors embraced it, and
providing a stable buffer against Soviet influence in east Africa.
   Moi contends multi-party democracy is unsuitable for Kenya and
other African countries because it could lead to tribal wars. Kenya
did have opposition parties after it gained independence in 1963
and until Moi, who took power in 1978, amended the constitution in
1982.

   Khmer Rouge guerrillas have
seized large areas deep inside Cambodia in recent months and say
they will fight as long as needed if they are shut out of a
political settlement.
   A recent five-week, 450-mile trip through the country's north by
this reporter found the Khmer Rouge have strong Chinese support and
have stockpiled caches of weapons, ammunition and funds in case
foreign aid is cut.
   The United States announced Wednesday it was withdrawing
recognition of the guerrilla coalition dominated by the Communist
Khmer Rouge. The coalition also includes the non-Communist forces
of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann.
   The U.S. move was prompted by fears of a return to power of the
Khmer Rouge. The Communist group killed hundreds of thousands of
people in forced agrarian reform in the 1970s until Vietnam invaded
and installed a new government in early 1979.
   The 30,000-man Khmer Rouge army already controls hundreds of
villages in the country's south, west and north, and it operates in
virtually all parts of the country.
   In their jungle command posts, senior Khmer Rouge commanders
said recently they were stepping up the fight to force the
Vietnamese-backed government into political concessions.
   ``The Khmer Rouge have everything they want from China. They
don't need any more guns or money,'' said Col. Khan Savoeun, a
commander of Sihanouk's army.
   ``U.S. support for the non-Communists is very important
psychologically for the non-Communist resistance. But it means
nothing for the Khmer Rouge.''
   Ta Pok, a Khmer Rouge brigade commander in this northwestern
province, said he listened to the Voice of America and Radio Free
Asia for news on peace and hoped for progress. But he said the
guerrillas cannot wait around for documents to be signed.
   ``The Vietnamese will only listen to strength, and if they don't
listen they will lose everything,'' Ta Pok said. ``Our strategy is
to isolate Kompong Speu, Battambang and Kompong Thom. But we
already have most of Kompong Speu and Kompong Thom. We are doing
very, very well.''
   The guerrillas have seized large quantities of weapons in recent
fighting. Dozens of hidden jungle bases are full of ammunition and
captured heavy weapons were seen in the north.
   The Chinese aid is channeled through the Thai border. But as the
guerrillas push deeper into the country, they rely on the hidden
caches and food from recently seized villages.
   Thousands of soldiers and civilian supporters were seen moving
freely through newly seized areas.
   Heavy fighting between Khmer Rouge and government troops holed
up at several key forward outposts defending Siem Riep city was
heard every day. The guerrillas mined roads, attacked supply
convoys and overran government artillery bases.
   ``We are winning more easily than we expected. There is nothing
that can stop us,'' said Khmer Rouge division commander Mit Lot, in
charge of areas around the ancient temples of Angkor Wat in Siem
Reap province.
   ``If (Cambodian Prime Minister) Hun Sen is not flexible, we will
fight and for sure we will win,'' he said.
   The guerrillas appear to have substantial popular support. Many
villagers say the Khmer Rouge are not forcing them to fight, and
pay those who help carry ammunition and supplies. The guerrillas
also pay a high price for rice.
   However, some villagers said they were afraid to refuse
guerrilla requests for help.
   As part of preparations in case foreign aid is cut, the Khmer
Rouge have seized large gem-mining areas in the south and collect
more than half a million dollars monthly in taxes from miners, said
Western intelligence analysts in Bangkok.
   In the north, they have created a sophisticated logging
operation and trucks full of teakwood head toward markets in
Thailand daily from vast forests under their control.
   The guerrillas now have a network of thousands of miles of roads
snaking from areas under their control to new front lines deep in
the interior. Dozens of Chinese-supplied trucks and jeeps were seen
ferrying ammunition to the guerrillas attacking positions around
Siem Riep and Angkor Wat.
   Bulldozers were clearing new paths in the jungles.
   ``A year ago we used porters to take supplies to the
frontlines,'' said Khmer Rouge commander Ta Pok. ``Now we have
trucks which can go anywhere.''
   Som Narin, a Sihanouk army commander, said the Khmer Rouge had
such firm control over the area near Angkor Wat they didn't even
need to carry guns. ``This is now Khmer Rouge Cambodia,'' he said.
   Tens of thousands of civilians who have lived in isolated jungle
camps run by the Khmer Rouge along the Thai border since 1979 have
moved to newly seized towns and villages in Cambodia.
   But while analysts agree the Khmer Rouge army is superior to the
government and the other guerrilla groups, there are signs they
have difficulties gaining wider support as they move from jungle
outposts to more populated areas.
   In many areas, villagers did not readily offer food and
information, although they did not do anything to oppose the Khmer
Rouge.

   When Karen Yee wanted to tell her
uncles she was safe after a devastating earthquake, she turned to
the local radio station in Baguio to get the message through.
   When Red Cross official Richard Gordon needed to confer with
authorities in quake-damaged Cabanatuan, he did so in a telephone
patch provided by another radio station, which aired the
consultations live.
   In the aftermath of Monday's earthquake, which left about 500
people dead, radio and television stations not only reported the
news.
   They helped rescuers and worried relatives circumvent poor
communications, and served as a spur to a clumsy, unresponsive
bureaucracy.
   Broadcasters directed rescuers to areas of destruction, relayed
messages to family members separated by the disaster and solicited
relief goods.
   ``It was the radio stations which were coordinating rescue
efforts, broacasting the need for blood, blankets, medicines,
earth-moving equipment,'' columnist Luis Beltran wrote in The
Manila Standard. ``Government departments went to them for guidance
on what to send, where to send.''
   After the quake struck, provincial affiliates of the major
networks broadcast the first reports of destruction. At that time,
President Corazon Aquino's staff said only that it was ``studying
the extent'' of the disaster.
   Provincial officials, unable to get through to Manila by
telephone, broadcast appeals to the capital for assistance over
private stations.
   Radio and television reporters traveled through the affected
area and briefed government officials about which towns and cities
were in urgent need of help.
   ``They served as effective alternatives to government agencies
whose addiction to routine has robbed them of the power of
initiative and the ability to respond quickly,'' former Labor
Minister Blas Ople wrote in The Manila Bulletin.
   As the extent of the disaster became clearer, managements of
stations DZRH, DZMM, DZBB, DZXL and others discontinued regular
programming for round-the-clock quake coverage.
   ``We shifted to public-service priority programming because we
feel that that is the need of the present time,'' said Maria
Asuncion Lanuza, program coordinator of DZBB. ``I think we are
complementing the government.''
   Faced with severe communications problems, government officials
turned to radio stations as an effective means of relaying
instructions.
   Late Monday, Gordon, the Red Cross official who also serves as
mayor of Olongapo, telephoned DZMM and asked the station to report
that he and a U.S. rescue team were heading to Cabanatuan to help
search for students trapped in a school building.
   While Gordon was on the telephone, the station patched his call
through to the Cabanatuan mayor. In a conversation broadcast live,
the two discussed what equipment and supplies were needed.
   The quake also isolated Baguio, a mountain resort 110 miles
north of Manila, by cutting off telephone service, damaging the
airport and triggering landslides that closed all roads.
   Ordinary people turned to the radio to relay messages to their
loved ones. In Baguio, radio stations set up an outdoor ``office''
along the main street, where people could tape brief messages that
were broadcast nationwide by affiliate stations.
   Relatives in Manila in turn aired appeals to family members in
quake-affected areas.
   In one message, Miss Yee said from Baguio that she and her
mother were safe but ``Daddy hasn't come yet.'' The message was
directed primarily at her father's brothers in Pampanga province.
   In Manila, a weeping Linda Pineda made an appeal over DZRH to
her three children studying in Baguio.
   ``If you are safe, my children, please go to reporters and tell
them you are fine,'' she sobbed.
   ``I don't know where you are, children,'' she added. ``But it
would reassure me if you send word through reporters.''

   The Justice Department was unable to pursue a
fraud claim against the maker of the B-2 bomber because the
government had known Northrop Corp.'s cost system was ``essentially
a farce,'' according to a document.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., on Wednesday disclosed portions of a
September 1988 Justice Department memorandum that found Northrop
submitted false cost and scheduling data to the Air Force on the
B-2 program. The disclosure came in a letter to Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney.
   ``While certain of the allegations concerning program
deficiencies are essentially accurate, the Air Force has known of
these facts for some time but has chosen to take no remedial
action,'' the memo said, so there is no fraud case to be made.
   Officials of the Air Force, Defense Department and Northrop
Corp., said they were aware of Dingell's letter but had no
immediate comment.
   The government has invested more than $25 billion to build the
radar-evading aircraft. Scrutiny of aircraft production, however,
has been limited because the program was classified until last year.
   The Justice Department said in the memo that the Defense
Contract Audit Agency had only two auditors assigned to Northrop to
oversee the operation. During that time, it said, the company's
cost schedule control system, which measures potential cost
overruns and schedule delays, produced false information.
   ``Northrop's cost schedule control system is essentially a
farce,'' the memo said.
   Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
on oversight and investigations, asked Cheney to assemble an
independent ``court of inquiry'' that would report to Congress by
Aug. 24.
   ``It is clear that in the Air Force's zeal to protect the
funding for the B-2 program, they have ignored or tolerated major
infractions by Northrop to the detriment of the taxpayers,''
Dingell said in the letter to Cheney.
   Faced with a diminished Soviet threat and an increasing budget
deficit, Cheney in April cut the production number of the
bat-winged aircraft from 132 to 75. But congressional opposition to
the plane remains, with lawmakers highly critical of the cost of
$860 million per plane.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, approving a $289 billion
defense bill last week, agreed to Cheney's request for two planes
in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 at a cost of nearly $5 billion
for the aircraft and other expenses.
   Amendments to kill the program are expected when the full Senate
takes up the bill.
   The House Armed Services Committee begins crafting its version
of the defense bill later this month and attempts to terminate the
B-2 program in the full House remain strong.

   Calling parole and prison officials
``bleeding hearts,'' a judge has thrown the book at a drug
trafficker caught dealing in cocaine after serving only a portion
of a previous sentence.
   ``Some idiot in the prison system thought you were rehabilitated
after three years,'' U.S. District Judge G. Kendall Sharp declared
in ordering Robert Zingarell back to prison.
   Zingarell, 49, had appeared before the judge in 1984 after being
convicted of selling 400 pounds of marijuana and 2.2 pounds of
cocaine. Sharp imposed what he thought was a harsh sentence: 10
years.
   Zingarell was back in court Wednesday, and the judge took the
occasion to blast the U.S. Parole Commission and the U.S. Bureau of
Prisons on the way they choose to release drug dealers.
   He then lambasted Zingarell, who served 3{ years in prison
before being paroled. He gave Zingarell another 10 years in prison,
despite a guilty plea and his cooperation with prosecutors.
   ``If they had put him away like I did the first time, he
wouldn't have been out dealing cocaine again,'' Sharp told a
reporter later.
   ``They are a bunch of bleeding hearts making room (for new
inmates) by cutting other people loose. I understand their problem,
but it undermines my ability to give what is an appropriate
sentence.
   ``They ought to ship them to an isolated island in the Pacific
and if they want to escape, let them try.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Cynthia Hawkins told Sharp of
Zingarell's cooperation in an investigation against some
co-defendants. Federal guidelines called for Zingarell to face up
to eight years in prison. Ms. Hawkins recommended he receive no
more than 6{ years. But Sharp departed from the guidelines and
recommendation in his 10-year sentence.
   Zingarell's attorney, Mark O'Mara, said Sharp improperly
enhanced both the seriousness of his client's crime and the range
of the sentence.
   ``I don't think he did it right and I know Mr. Zingarell will
appeal,'' O'Mara said.

   Fallen baseball hero Pete Rose was sentenced
today to five months in prison and fined $50,000 for cheating on
his taxes.
   ``I have no excuses because it's all my fault,'' the former
manager of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team said. ``I lost my
dignity, I lost my self respect ... and I almost lost a lot of dear
friends.''
   Rose was sentenced for failing to report more than $354,000 in
income from baseball memorabilia sales, autograph appearances and
the gambling for which he was banned from professional baseball.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel also ordered Rose to spend
three months in a halfway house after the prison term and perform
1,000 hours of community service with inner-city youths. He could
have sentenced Rose to six years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   Spiegel repeatedly referred to Rose's standing as a baseball
hero, but said he had to ignore Rose's fame in considering
punishment.
   ``Today we are not dealing with the legend,'' he said.
   The 49-year-old Rose blames his troubles on a gambling disorder,
for which he's getting treatment. He first denied having a gambling
problem when friends told investigators he bet on Cincinnati Reds
games while managing the team.
   He still denies betting on baseball, but accepted a lifetime ban
from the sport last August. He is eligible next month to apply for
reinstatement to baseball, but has indicated he will not do so.
   Rose, limping from a knee injury, showed no visible reaction
when he was sentenced. But earlier, Rose's voice broke as he told
the judge he was sorry.
   ``Your honor, I'd like to say I'm very sorry, very shameful to
be here today in front of you,'' Rose said.
   His voice faltered again when he told the judge how his
5-year-old son had told his wife that ``his daddy is a jailbird.''
   Spiegel allowed Rose to remain free until Aug. 10, so that he
may have surgery on his injured knee. Then he is expected to report
to a federal prison in Ashland, Ky.
   Spiegel praised Rose's accomplishments on the baseball field,
but said he had to impose a jail sentence out of fairness.
   ``Foremost, we must recognize that there are two people here:
Pete Rose, the living legend, the all-time hit leader and the idol
of millions; and Pete Rose, the individual who appears today
convicted of two counts of cheating on his taxes,'' Spiegel said.
``Today we are not dealing with the legend.''
   Rose's tax problems began to surface when baseball investigator
John Dowd started looking into his betting habits in early 1989. A
federal grand jury was convened in Cincinnati to see whether Rose
reported all of his income.
   Rose agreed to plead guilty April 20 to two counts of failing to
report income. Federal prosecutors agreed not to pursue further
charges.
   Rose admitted he hid $354,968 in income from 1984 to 1987. He
has repaid the Internal Revenue Service $366,042 as part of the
plea agreement.
   Two of Rose's reputed gambling associates, former roommate
Thomas Gioiosa and bookmaker Ronald Peters, were sentenced last
year on drug and tax charges.
   Peters received a two-year term for tax evasion and cocaine
distribution. Peters claimed he accepted Rose's bets, including
bets on Reds games. Rose admitted Gioiosa placed his bets with
bookmakers.
   Gioiosa was sentenced to a five-year term for transporting
cocaine and five months on two tax counts.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 79-year-old mother only
recently got a new color television to replace her old
black-and-white set, still bakes her own bread and complains her
son never visits.
   In an unusually revealing story about the family of a Soviet
leader, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported Thursday that
the only privilege given to Maria Pantelyevna Gorbachev are the KGB
agents who provide security down the road from her small house in
the southern Russian village of Privolnoye.
   The KGB is there not so much to guard her from the many
journalists who find their way to the farming village where
Gorbachev was born, but to keep ordinary citizens from pestering
her with petitions for her son, the newspaper said.
   Until recently, the private lives of Communist Party leaders and
their families rarely appeared in the state-run media, but under
Gorbachev's policy of greater openness, or glasnost, many
restrictions have been lifted. Although the Western media have
reported on Gorbachev's roots and his family, such things are new
to Soviet readers.
   Thursday's front-page article, titled ``Home of the President,''
was complete with an old photograph of a young, plump Gorbachev
reclining in a field wearing a jaunty beret.
   Gorbachev's widowed mother, the newspaper said, still does the
chores around the house and bakes her own bread, even though a
collective farm bakery was built several years ago to feed the
village's 3,000 people.
   A new paint job on her house and the color TV that recently
replaced the old ``Rekord'' model black-and-white set ``have not
cost the state or the party one kopeck,'' wrote Komsomolskaya
Pravda correspondent O. Shapovalov.
   Not long ago, a rumor spread that Mrs. Gorbachev was moving to
Moscow and selling her house, the newspaper said.
   Residents of Privolnoye were ready to make inquiries about
buying her house, but she told Nikolai Dorokhov, her neighbor and
secretary of the party organization of the collective farm:
   ``I have already lived in Moscow. I don't see my son here and I
wouldn't see him there. He leaves home at 6 a.m. and returns late
in the evening. ... I will not go anywhere.''
   Gorbachev last visited his birthplace 3{ years ago, the
newspaper reported, and while he was there spent only 40 minutes
inside his house and another 40 minutes talking to villagers.
   Earlier this week, he met with West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl in nearby Stavropol, where he began his Communist Party work
in 1955. But he apparently didn't visit his mother in Privolnoye.
   Alla Georgievna Zavalikhina, ideology secretary of the party
committee in nearby Krasnogvardeisky, usually accompanies
journalists who visit Privolnoye, and complained to the newspaper
about the manners of Soviet reporters.
   ``Foreign correspondents are more tactful. At least no one who
was warned beforehand tried to get into her house,'' Mrs.
Zavalikhina said.
   ``It's more difficult to explain to ours. One Soviet TV crew
wanted to interview her for a popular show by any means,'' she
added.
   ``Isn't it clear that it isn't decent to bother an elderly
woman, even if this woman is not the president's mother?''
   The newspaper reported that although there is a small Gorbachev
display at the party offices in Stavropol, Privolnoye has no
museums or plaques to mark its historic significance _ by
presidential request.
   All this is to the chagrin of Venyamin A. Lutsenko, director of
a small party museum in in Krasnogvardeisky, 12 miles away. He told
the newspaper he'd really like to have the pen that Gorbachev and
former President Reagan used in 1987 to sign the treaty to destroy
medium-range nuclear weapons.
   Thus, the only monument in Privolnoye is the roadblock manned by
the KGB agents who, according to the newspaper, tell citizens
trying to pass along their petitions to use the mailbox.

   A 6-month-old girl was killed by a neighbor's pit
bull terrier as the infant slept in her bedroom, police say.
   Tionna Kenny was bitten on the head, neck and arms by the dog,
whose owner apparently was caring for the child at the time of the

   The dog's owner, Tyrone Hardy, told police he heard the dog
growling and the child cry out. Hardy said he could not free the
child from the dog's grip, according to police officer Ed Barkowski.
   The dog will be destroyed, said Peter Poholik, director of the

<HEAD>Spokesman Flustered Over Question of Zhao's Rehabilitation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media reports from Hong Kong and Washington that
ousted Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang is being rehabilitated
drew flustered claims of ignorance Thursday from a Foreign Ministry
spokesman.
   ``I haven't seen such a report,'' Jin Guihua said at the
ministry's weekly news conference. ``I advise you not to believe
this kind of rumors too easily.''
   After the news conference, worried he might be misunderstood,
the normally unflappable Jin told reporters in flustered English:
``I must say that, the conditions of Zhao Ziyang, I don't know, I
don't know. His present status, I don't know, so don't misquote me.
   ``What I want to advise you, there are so many rumors. The
honest advice I give you is not to believe. There are too many
rumors. Rumors are rampant. Be careful. That's all.''
   Jin refused to deny the reports outright. However, the official
Xinhua News Agency later quoted an unidentified Foreign Ministry
official as saying the reports were ``a groundless rumor'' and that
Zhao was still being investigated. Jin made no such statement at
the news conference.
   The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post on Tuesday quoted
an unidentified U.S. official as saying senior leader Deng Xiaoping
was planning to send Zhao on an inspection mission throughout
China. The paper said the information came from members of a
delegation of Chinese mayors touring U.S. cities.
   The Los Angeles Times quoted an unidentified U.S. official in
Washington as saying that Zhao already was making an inspection
trip.
   Giving Zhao such an assignment would be tantamount to
rehabilitating him and would signal a reassessment at the highest
party levels of the handling of last year's student-led
demonstrations for democracy.
   That in turn would reflect a major realignment of forces at the
top of the party one year after ideological hard-liners prevailed
with their position that pressure for democratic reform must be
quashed at all costs.
   Zhao was ousted last year as party general secretary for
allegedly supporting the demonstrations and opposing the army
attack that crushed them. The party Central Committee accused him
of ``splitting the party,'' a serious offense, and official media
reports accused his aides of plotting a virtual coup on his behalf.
   Officials say his case is still under investigation, indicating
he has powerful supporters. One is believed to be Deng himself, who
brought Zhao to Beijing in 1980 to help carry out his market-style
economic reforms.
   Zhao was an enthusiastic economic reformer but was not an
advocate of sweeping political changes. Shortly before his ouster,
however, he visited the demonstrating students in Tiananmen Square
and expressed sympathy for them.
   There have been subtle signals recently of political jostling
behind the scenes. Analyzing the signals has become a preoccupation
among Beijing intellectuals. Many believe the signals reflect
growing strength in the reformist camp.
   Zhao, meanwhile, is widely believed to be living at in a small
walled compound in central Beijing.
   Also Thursday, the Beijing Economics Institute confirmed
unofficial reports that fugitive student leader Zhai Weimin had
been arrested and jailed. A university official contacted by
telephone said she had no details and did not give her name.
   Zhai, 22, is the fourth Beijing student known to have been
arrested without publicity in the past three months, even as the
government tries to ease foreign criticism by announcing large
prisoner releases.
   The other three were students at Beijing University suspected of
involvement in underground activities.
   In February, Zhai held a secret conference in Beijing of his
underground reform group, the Democratic Front for the Salvation of
China. Participants in the conference told foreign journalists at
the time that more than 60 people took part.

   A proposal to sell the organs of dead welfare
recipients has prompted such outrage that some people fear it will
undermine other plans to solve a serious organ donor crisis.
   Milwaukee County Board Supervisor T. Anthony Zielinski made the
proposal in an effort to reduce the county's burial expenses. But a
flood of criticism persuaded him to drop the plan, and it now has
no chance of passage.
   Still, some observers are worried that the political backlash
from Zielinski's plan will doom other proposals to help relieve
donor organ shortages.
   One such proposal would have allowed welfare recipients to sign
forms permitting the county to donate their organs after death.
That plan is now likely to be scuttled, according to Jeff Aiken, a
spokesman for the Milwaukee County Social Services Department.
   ``There is a desperate need for organs. This was one way to make
welfare recipients aware of the need for organ transplant,'' Aikin
said.
   Zielinski had proposed selling the organs whether or not the
welfare recipients had granted permission.
   ``If they can't help society while they're alive, maybe they can
help it while they're dead,'' he said after introducing the
proposal in May.
   He said the organs could be sold to hospitals or organ donor
networks, although it is not clear whether they would be willing to
purchase the organs. All organs now are donated.
   Critics, including colleagues of Zielinski and advocates for the
poor, said his plan would rob the poor of dignity even in death.
   ``I don't think we ought to start selling poor people's organs
just because they died on welfare,'' Supervisor Elizabeth
Coggs-Jones said.
   Zielinski, 29, dropped the idea after initial criticism. Then he
renewed anger a short time later when he suggested Wisconsin
legalize donor organ sales, which now violate the state
constitution.
   He also proposed that the county cremate rather than bury dead
welfare recipients to save money.
   He has since apologized for both plans and changed his position.
He also said he doesn't support the proposal to ask welfare
recipients if they would like to become organ donors.
   ``I'm opposed to asking welfare recipients that question. I'm
opposed to cremating them. If they don't state a choice they should
be buried. It should be the preference of the individual. Whatever
they want,'' Zielinski said.
   Elizabeth Bolt, organ procurement director for Milwaukee's
Froedtert Memorial Hospital, said despite the serious need for more
donor organs she understood why Zielinski's proposals met
opposition.
   ``There's a very strong feeling that this should be voluntary.
We talk about the gift of life, the gift of organ donations,'' Ms.
Bolt said Wednesday.
   Like Aiken, she said she believed the response to Zielinski's
proposals could doom other efforts to encourage organ donations by
welfare recipients.

   Five Cubans who entered the residence of a
Czechoslovak diplomat in Havana to seek asylum left the building
today wearing masks and were taken away in a Cuban police vehicle,
a news agency reported.
   The brief report from Havana by Mexico's official news agency
Notimex quoted unidentified journalists. It did not say whether the
Cubans had acted voluntarily or explain why they were wearing the
masks.
   The four Cuban men and one woman took refuge in the residence of
the charge d'affaires, Jan Doemoek, last week. They were among
small groups of Cuban asylum-seekers who began entering embassies
in Havana eight days ago.
   Their departure came as Spain and Cuba exchanged barbs over the
flight of asylum-seekers to the Spanish Embassy in Havana. Madrid
recalled its ambassador after Cuban police seized one of the
refugees, sent more guards to the compound, and suspended $2.5
million in grants to Cuba.
   The European commissioner for Latin American relations, Abel
Matutes of Spain, said through a spokesman today in Brussels that
three ``symbolic'' aid projects about to be undertaken by the EC
with Cuba would not go ahead.
   At least 13 Cubans have reportedly holed up in embassies or
residences of Spain, Czechoslovakia and Italy.
   The embassy standoffs have drawn wide publicity because similar
situations in East German embassies last year helped precipitate
the fall of that nation's hard-line Communist government. Albania,
which like Cuba has refused to adopt Western-style reforms, also
recently allowed hundreds of people who occupied embassies in its
capital, Tirana, to leave for new lives in the West.
   State radio and television in Cuba today gave extensive coverage
to the trial of 11 human rights activists who were convicted in
Havana of crimes against the state, the official Cuban news agency
Prensa Latina said.
   The coverage featured the prosecutor accusing U.S. officials in
Havana of ``instigating'' the activists, the dispatch from Havana
said.
   Prosecutor Sara Nieves said officials at the U.S. Interests
Section had provided logistical support and ``orientation'' to the
members of Pro-Human Rights Youth, who were convicted on Wednesday.
   According to Prensa Latina, she said the United States was using
the group to ``foment economic chaos and carry out terrorist acts.''
   The activists were given sentences ranging from 15 years in
prison to three years of house arrest for counterrevolutionary
crimes such as terrorism and rebellion.
   The dispatch said the defendants had planned to steal explosives
to blow up the National Library and the Cuban Institute of Radio
and Television.
   Nieves also accused the defendants of contact with other Western
diplomatic missions and with Venezuelan diplomats, Prensa Latina
said.
   The dispatch, monitored in Mexico City, said Nieves described
Pro-Human Rights Youth as the armed wing of the outlawed Pro-Human
Rights Party.
   Spain said it has recalled Ambassador Antonio Serrano de Haro
for consultations. It accused Cuba of words ``removed from the
customary niceties of international co-existence.''
   The tensions broke into the open earlier in the day when Spain's
foreign minister, Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, suggested to
reporters that leader Fidel Castro knew his regime would crumble if
he opened the door to all Cubans who want to leave. Cuba, a former
Spanish colony, has 11 million residents.
   ``The situation in Havana is very nervous due to Cuba's
isolation from the world and because of the extremely serious
economic problems there,'' Fernandez Ordonez told Spanish National
Radio. ``No one wants a catastrophe there. What is needed is a
peaceful transition to democracy.''
   Cuba retaliated later in the day, issuing its own statement
saying Spain had violated Cuban and international law by harboring
asylum-seekers. It said in a statement that it would never yield to
``pressure or blackmail'' by people seeking to leave the Caribbean
island, Prensa Latina reported.
   The Cuban statement also accused Spain's foreign minister of
suffering from an ``attack of historical amnesia,'' displaying a
``scandalous lack of education about international law'' and being
``morally disqualified'' from commenting on Cuban human rights.
   Cuba was a Spanish colony from the 16th century to 1898.
   Castro's government has portrayed the asylum-seekers as
``antisocial elements.''
   Also Wednesday, Madrid sent a special security squad to Havana,
Cuba's capital, to reinforce security at the Spanish Embassy.
   Cuban police entered the grounds of the Spanish Embassy on
Friday in pursuit of a young Cuban asylum-seeker and arrested him.
Three other Cubans were reportedly inside the embassy, and a fourth
arrived Wednesday, according to the Spanish news agency EFE.
   On Tuesday, Cuban police arrested a man in the U.S. diplomatic
post in Havana. Both Spain and the United States protested the
incidents.
   The Cuban refugee crisis has attracted attention in part because
it is reminiscent of the East German refugees who sought passage to
the West at embassies in Eastern Europe last year. Their exodus
helped precipitate the fall of East Germany's rigid Communist
government.
   Albania, which like Cuba has refused to adopt democratic
reforms, just last week allowed hundreds of people who had entered
embassies in its capital to leave for new lives in the West.

   Three Republican presidents who
followed Richard Nixon into office today praised him as a man who
made the world a safer place.
   Thousands turned out on a sweltering day for the dedication of
Nixon's presidential libary and hear speeches from President Bush
and former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford.
   Nixon was the nation's 37th president and only one to resign
from office.
   ``Nothing we have ever seen matches this moment, to be welcomed
home so warmly on this day,'' Nixon said on behalf of himself and
his wife, Pat.
   Bush paid tribute to Nixon as ``a true architect of peace,'';
Ford's and Reagan's speeches were laced with humor and fond
remembrances.
   ``You, Dick Nixon, have the gratitude of men and women
everywhere who cherish peace with liberty,'' said Ford.
   ``I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that the world is
a better place _ a safer place _ because of Richard Nixon,'' Reagan
said.
   In a glowing tribute, Bush said ``Richard Nixon was the
quintessence of Middle America,'' a leader who presided over the
nation during times ``perhaps as tumultuous as any since
Lincoln's.''
   ``Richard Nixon helped change the course not only of America but
of the entire world,'' said Bush. He said Nixon's path-breaking
trip to China in 1972 ``revolutionized the world,'' and recalled
that it was Nixon who signed the first agreement with the Soviets
to limit strategic nuclear arms.
   Among those at the dedication were former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger and other Nixon administration officials and
Nixon's daughters, Julie Nixon Eisenhower and Tricia Nixon and
their husbands.
   Tourists also turned out for the event. Wearing sandals, shorts
and carrying beach chairs, thousands waited outside the Nixon
library at dawn, paying $15 to park and shelling out another $15
for presidential T-shirts.
   Police said 15,000 people were at the gates when they opened
after dawn. ``It's a very historic event, especially with four
presidents here,'' said Margaret Gavras, 29, of Huntington Beach
who arrived Wednesday night and parked her motor home at a church.
   Jimmy Carter was the only living former president _ and the only
Democrat among them _ not attending the opening. He had a previous
commitment, said Carrie Harmon, spokeswoman for the Carter
Presidential Center in Atlanta. She would not elaborate.
   Nixon and his wife visited the $21 million library Wednesday for
the first time and viewed restoration of the house where he was
born. A handful of tourists applauded him and some Girl Scouts
handed Mrs. Nixon a bouquet.
   ``As a young boy in Yorba Linda, I never thought of being the
president of the United States,'' Nixon says on a tape recording to
be played for visitors to the 900-square-foot home. ``My goal was
to become a railroad engineer.''
   Many of the furnishings in the house were there when he was born
Jan. 9, 1913, including the bed he was born in and the quilt that
covered it.
   He was 9 when his parents moved to Whittier, where Nixon made
his first successful run for Congress in 1946. Library displays
follow his career from there to the Senate in 1950, the vice
presidency in 1952 and the presidency in 1968.
   The Watergate scandal culminated in Nixon's resignation on Aug.
9, 1974. The resignation also is treated in library displays.
   Visitors to the library can hear crucial White House tapes of
conversations Nixon had about Watergate with administration
officials _ recordings that lost Nixon the political support he
needed to survive calls for his impeachment.
   ``If anything, the opening of the library and the birthplace
will draw more attention to Watergate because that is what most of
those who are covering the event for the media are most interested
in,'' Nixon told the Los Angeles Times.
   ``Over time, as their interest fades, and if the public
continues to visit the museum, I would think that all the events
covered will be seen in a more objective perspective,'' Nixon said
in a written response to the newspaper's questions.
   On Wednesday, Nixon met with some former officials of his
administration who gathered for the dedication.
   ``I've never been concerned about his place in history,'' said
Bruce Whelihan, who worked in the Nixon White House press office.
   ``I always knew it would happen. It was just a matter of time,''
said former speechwriter Kenneth Khachigian.
   San Clemente, which Nixon put on the map as his ``Western White
House,'' had been the planned site of the library. There was even a
ceremonial groundbreaking, but the project got caught in red tape.
Nixon eventually withdrew his permission and was delighted when
Yorba Linda offered a home.
   The library will simply be a museum for a year until papers from
before and after Nixon's presidency are brought here and made
available to scholars.
   Nixon's presidential papers were impounded by Congress and are
in a government warehouse in Alexandria, Va. Some 1.5 million of
the White House documents will be recorded on digital disks for use
by scholars at the library.
   By Nixon's choice, his library will get neither federal money
nor Secret Service protection. He contributed $2 million to the
library.
   Admission is $3.95 for adults.

   A plan to provide U.S. support for emerging
Eastern European democracies became tangled in a political dispute
Thursday as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democrats approved
an aid package despite a Republican boycott.
   The Democrat-controlled panel voted 10-0, with all nine
Republican members absent, to send the $535 million bill to the
full Senate. The measure would give President Bush a long menu of
ideas for advancing economic reform in the former Warsaw Pact
nations, including ``technical assistance'' for the Soviet Union.
   The committee's senior Republican, Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, said in a letter to Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., who
chairs the panel, that ``the feeling of comity has collapsed''
during work on the East Europe aid bill.
   Helms complained that the measure was being rushed into action
without time for Republicans to review it and his aides said the
Bush administration had an extensive list of concerns about the
measure's overall cost and its specific provisions.
   Unlike foreign aid legislation passed last year, in which U.S.
help was limited to Poland and Hungary, the measure approved
Thursday makes assistance available to any Eastern European country
that Bush believes needs help on its road to democratic and
economic reform.
   The bill makes available $535 million for the programs in the
year that begins Oct. 1, well in excess of the $300 million Bush
had sought and an increase from the $489 million already approved
by the House.
   Pell said the measure would provide ``an expanded American role
in the effort to transform Eastern Europe'' by helping U.S.
businesses invest in the countries, promoting trade and development
and encouraging educational and cultural exchanges.
   The bill contains $100 million for environmental, housing and
medical assistance. It also includes $70 million for the first U.S.
payment to start up the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, an institution set up to encourage East Europe's
emergence into the economic mainstream.
   But the committee's hour-long meeting included almost no
discussion of the 114-page bill. Members instead defended their
procedures in bringing it up for action, insisting that Republicans
had no cause to boycott the session.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said he had already made numerous
changes to accommodate Bush administration concerns after meeting
July 11 with Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger. ``This
is what the administration wanted,'' Biden said.
   But in a letter dated Tuesday, Eagleburger told Biden that even
with the changes the administration still prefers the House version
of the bill.
   Biden said he was not prepared to sit ``twiddling our thumbs''
while Eastern European economies are in a desperate need of help.
``I would at least hope people would show up and take a position
on'' the bill, rather than boycotting the committee's meeting, he
said.
   ``If one party has to govern, let's govern,'' said Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and the Democrats voted.

   President Bush today paid tribute to
Richard M. Nixon as ``a true architect of peace'' whose troubled
presidency helped change the course of the world.
   In a glowing tribute at the dedication of the Nixon Library,
Bush said ``Richard Nixon was the quintessence of Middle America,''
a leader who presided over the nation during times ``perhaps as
tumultuous as any since Lincoln's.''
   Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford joined Bush and Nixon with their
wives at the rare gathering of four American presidents for
ceremonies opening the $21 million library and museum on the site
of the farmhouse where Nixon was born.
   Speaking to a crowd of thousands on a sweltering hot morning,
Bush made only a passing reference to Watergate, the scandal that
forced Nixon to resign.
   Sixteen years ago, as chairman of the Republican National
Committee, Bush wrote an anguished letter urging Nixon to resign
rather than fight impeachment. Nixon announced his resignation the
next day, Aug. 8, 1974.
   Bush said visitors to the Nixon library will learn ``that more
people voted for Richard Nixon as president than any other man in
history.''
   Noting Nixon's eight books, Bush said, ``he had an
intellectual's complexity.''
   ``Richard Nixon was the quintessence of Middle America and
touched deep chords of response in millions of her citizens,'' said
Bush. He said Nixon invoked a ``silent majority'' to support his
policies during his turbulent years in office.
   ``Richard Nixon helped change the course not only of America but
of the entire world,'' said Bush. He said Nixon's path-breaking
trip to China in 1972 ``revolutionized the world,'' and recalled
that it was Nixon who signed the first agreement with the Soviets
to limit strategic nuclear arms.
   ``Richard Nixon endured much in his quest for `Peace with Honor'
in Vietnam. He knew that true peace means the triumph of freedom,
not merely the absence of war,'' said Bush, the 41st president.
   ``Today, as the movement toward democracy sweeps our globe, you
can take real pride that history will say of you: `Here was a true
architect of peace','' said Bush.
   Bush also paid tribute to former first lady Patricia Nixon,
saying she ``ranks among the most admired women of postwar
America.''
   After Bush introduced Nixon, the former president said, ``This
is the first time I've ever been introduced by the president of the
United States.''
   Nixon said that in all his world travels, ``Nothing we have ever
seen matches this moment, to be welcomed home again so warmly.''
   Jimmy Carter, the only Democrat to occupy the White House since
Nixon's presidency, was the only living president not at the
ceremony. He had business elsewhere.
   ``I'm very pleased to be going to this dedication,'' Bush told
reporters Wednesday as he flew west with Nixon's daughter, Tricia
Cox, her husband and son as guests aboard Air Force One.
   It was the first gathering of four presidents since Nixon,
Carter, Ford and Reagan met at the White House in 1981 after the
assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
   Reagan, at 79, is the oldest of the group. Both Nixon and Ford
are 77; Bush is 66.
   Bush's ties with Nixon go back to the early 1960s, a decade
before Watergate, when Bush was a politically ambitious Harris
County Republican chairman looking to the former vice president for
help.
   Nixon stumped in Texas for Bush in his unsuccessful race for
Senate in 1964, then again at the kickoff of Bush's successful 1966
run for a House seat from Houston.
   In his autobiography, ``Looking Forward,'' Bush wrote that he
was mentioned as a possible running mate for Nixon in 1968. After
passing the Texan over for Spiro Agnew, Nixon told him, ``I really
couldn't pick a one-term congressman.''
   After Bush lost a second Senate race in 1970, Nixon tapped him
as ambassador to the United Nations, and three years later
recruited him as Republican national chairman.
   Bush stepped into the party job as the Watergate scandal was
erupting over the White House, eventually ensnaring Nixon for
ordering a cover-up of Republican operatives' break-in at
Democratic Party headquarters in 1972. Nixon's final months in
office were ``a political nightmare,'' Bush wrote.
   At the end, he said, he was afraid Nixon ``would bring the party
down with him'' if he stayed in office to fight impeachment.
   On Aug. 7, 1974, Bush wrote the embattled president:
   ``It is my considered judgment that you should now resign. ... I
now feel that resignation is best for the country, best for this
president.''
   Bush conferred with Nixon last fall after the former president
returned from a visit to China.

   Divers found the bodies of two people in
a submerged car after a neighborhood dog brought home shoes with
decomposing human feet in them, authorities said.
   The bodies found Wednesday were believed to be those of two
people reported missing May 5, Lt. Ralph Dyer of the Bay County
Sheriff's Department said Thursday.
   The names were withheld pending confirmation by the medical
examiner, he said.
   Honey, a golden retriever-Labrador mix, brought a soggy old shoe
to her owner Monday in this Florida Panhandle community north of
Panama City.
   ``I thought it was my neighbor's, so I went over and looked at
it and there was an ankle bone sticking up,'' said Tammy Quick, the
dog's owner.
   Honey, who swims and forages daily in Fanning Bayou, found
another shoe with a foot in it Wednesday before sheriff's scuba
divers discovered the car and bodies 20 feet below the surface of
creek leading into the bayou, Dyer said.

<TEXT>
   A radio station wants to give President
Bush's preppy wardrobe the boot during his visit and instead spur
the chap on to wearing cowboy clothes.
   An offhand comment by a Denver radio talk show host that Bush's
clothes don't fit the frontier image started the search for the
perfect _ if imaginary _ presidential cowboy wardrobe.
   Steve Kelley of KOA-AM, Denver's all-talk radio station, which
can be heard in Cheyenne, noted on the air Wednesday that Bush
``looks a little too preppy for the West, at least as far as we're
concerned.''
   The result of listeners' suggestions and Kelley's calls to
Denver-area Western clothing stores to find the most outlandish
duds on the market is a wardrobe that runs the gamut of Western
flash and trash.
   The list includes a Western shirt complete with rhinestone
snaps, a silver-inlaid mother-of-pearl bolo tie which ``at 45 bucks
(is) not too cheap,'' chaps and ostrich-skin cowboy boots. The
boots, Kelley found, run $499 a pair.
   Like most Western get-ups, the president's make-believe Western
gear will be capped by a belt buckle of grand proportions.
   ``We wanted to find one that was manhole-sized because, after
all, he is the president. But the best we could do was
dish-sized,'' Kelley said.
   The hardest item to locate was a pair of chaps, suggesting to
Kelley that there might be a dearth of real cowboys.
   To his amazement, the talk show host said, he received a call
from a woman claiming to be from the White House who said the
president wants to bring some spurs back from his trip out West.
   Bush was scheduled to be in Cheyenne and southeast Wyoming for a
few hours on Friday and was planning to do some fishing in addition
to making a speech marking the state's centennial as well as
Frontier Days, a 92-year-old rodeo and Western festival.
   Kelley says he plans to be in Cheyenne for the presidential
visit and will try to come up with a Western gift, even if he can't
put together a dream outfit.

   The New Kids on the Block repaid a favor
to the group that helped make them stars.
   Two years ago, when they were trying to break into the music
business, the New Kids performed for 3,000 people at the Boy Scouts
of America National Law Enforcement Explorer Conference in Boston.
At the time, it was their biggest show, said group member Donnie
Wahlberg.
   Now the New Kids' single ``Step By Step'' is on the top of the
charts and they draw huge audiences, such as the crowd of 50,000
Tuesday night at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington, D.C.
   The group hustled here after that show to headline ``Star
Night'' at this year's Explorer conference, held at the University
of Colorado.
   ``It was such a big show for us at the time,'' Wahlberg said,
referring to the 1988 concert. ``We just wanted to return the
favor.''
   New Kids performed for free at Wednesday's conference, which
brings together young people who plan careers in law enforcement.

   A social services center named for Rose Kennedy
was dedicated Thursday as part of the family's observance of their
matriarch's 100th birthday.
   Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of the late U.S. senator and host of
the event, said the center was inspired by his grandmother's ``long
lasting commitment to the family and the values that are derived
from a caring and nurturing environment.''
   The Brooklyn center will serve elderly women and homeless young
mothers when it opens in 1991. It is in the Bedford-Stuyvesant
Restoration area, a project backed by the late senator.

   Count Nikolai Tolstoy said Thursday he will
abandon his appeal against a libel award because he cannot afford
to post a deposit required by the Court of Appeal.
   Tolstoy had sought to overturn the record award of $2.7 million
to Lord Aldington, whom Tolstoy had accused of war crimes during
World War II.
   Three judges of the Court of Appeal ruled Thursday that
Tolstoy's appeal had little chance of success, and that if he
wished to proceed he must depost $226,000 within 14 days as
security for Aldington's costs.
   ``I cannot possibly raise that kind of money within 14 days so
this is the end of the legal road,'' said Tolstoy, author of the
book ``Victims of Yalta'' and a descendant of the Russian author
Leo Tolstoy.
   Tolstoy wrote a pamphlet that accused Aldington of arranging to
hand over 70,000 Cossacks and anti-Titoist Yugoslavs to their
communist enemies, knowing they faced torture or death. Aldington
was Brigadier General Staff in the Eighth Army V Corps in southern
Austria at the close of World War II.
   Lord Justice Beldam, one of the three justices hearing the case,
said Tolstoy's interpretation of documents ``lacked in many
instances the intellectual objectivity and reasoned impartiality
upon which his reputation is based.
   ``That he failed to convince the jury of the charges against
Lord Aldington was amply demonstrated by its unprecedented and
enormous award,'' Beldam said.
   The appeal judges refused Tolstoy permission to appeal to the
House of Lords. They also ordered him to pay the estimated $39,800
costs of the Court of Appeal hearings.

<HEAD>Heat Wave in Britain Brings Insects, Pollution and Water Shortage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A hot and unusually dry summer has Britons choking
on pollution, swatting insects and snitching on their water-wasting
neighbors.
   Even the water provides no relief: the National Rivers Authority
says algae in many waterways is causing rashes, nausea and diarrhea.
   But it wasn't until a visitor punched an attendant in a public
garden _ a place considered only slightly less sacred than a church
in England _ that the seriousness of the island's latest heat wave
became apparent to all.
   Temperatures have been in the eighties on seven of the past
eight days.
   Monday was the exception, with a balmy 79.
   Although many Americans would be disappointed if the mercury
didn't reach that high during the summer months, British officials
responded with warnings.
   Joggers, the elderly and infirm have been warned by the
Environment Department to avoid strenuous exercise.
   ``Don't swim here,'' says the National Rivers Authority at 177
stretches of water choked with algae.
   Eight pollution-sensitive tobacco plants were planted in the
Parliament Square flower beds in central London by junior
conservationists. On Wednesday Environment Minister David Trippier
got a first-hand look at how bad things are. The plants had already
developed brown spots from pollution.
   Some peoples' tempers weren't in much better shape.
   On Sunday an attendant at Oxford's world-famous Botanic Garden
was punched by a visitor who didn't want to leave at closing time.
   It must have been the heat, surmised the superintendent, Tim
Walker. ``It was a hideous day, 93 in the shade.''
   The garden shut for a week in protest, overreaction perhaps,
considering the attendant suffered only a bruised cheek, but as
Walker pointed out: ``It's not the sort of behavior you expect from
the British garden-loving public.''
   Then there are wasps, thrips, thunder-flies and leaf-hoppers,
which multiply in flowers and shrubbery and lie in wait for plant
lovers bending to smell a blossom or cut the hedge. Rashes,
splotches and bites soon follow.
   ``Thunder-Fly Plague Feared,'' The Daily Telegraph headlined
Tuesday.
   ``The shop is full of people complaining about the heat and
saying they are being bitten to death,'' said Sue Birch, a south
London pharmacist.
   ``The trouble seems to come from midges, little flies. We also
get complaints about fleas. The hot weather makes the fleas fidgety
and they jump off cats and dogs and land on people.
   ``The other big complaint is about suntan burns, especially from
families who take off their car roofs. We aren't used to so much
sun in this country.''
   Although Britain is stereotyped as a rainy, gloomy place,
temperatures exceed 80 every summer, and in eight years of this
century have hit 95.
   London has had less than 8.5 inches of rain this year compared
with nearly 15 inches in the same period last year.
   A ban on watering gardens and washing cars begins Saturday for 1
million people north and east of London, in Hertfordshire and
Essex, and in some northern parts of the capital. Bans are already
in force for more than 1 million people in Yorkshire, Sussex, Kent
and large parts of Devon.
   The restrictions are announced in the media, and neighbors who
spot people watering their gardens or washing their cars with hoses
are expected to turn them in to the local authorities, who can then
impose fines.
   In severe drought, helicopters are used to spot rogue lawn
waterers.
   Water authorities say water supply problems are cause for
concern, but not panic.
   August will be a scorcher with severe drought, says Piers
Corbyn, a long-range weather forecaster.
   ``It is expected to be one of the hottest Augusts this century,
probably breaking many records,'' he predicted.
   Corbyn, a lecturer in astrophysics, said he made more than
$3,600 by betting on the weather last year. He currently has 29
different bets with bookmakers on the weather and said he won $513
last month.

<HEAD>Coalition Urges Congress To Act To Halt Loss Of Black-Owned Farms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With minority-owned farms disappearing three
times as fast as white-owned farms, a coalition of religious and
farm groups called Thursday for congressional action to reverse the
trend.
   The coalition, joined by about 25 black farmers from across the
South, urged passage of legislation sponsored by Sen. Wyche Fowler
Jr., D-Ga., and Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., to help minority farmers
stay in business and provide opportunities for minority youth to
enter farming.
   Fowler said the situation has worsened since 1982, when the
Civil Rights Commission reported that the number of black-owned
farms in the United States had declined by 94 percent since 1920.
   While the commission found that black farms were disappearing
2.5 times as fast as white-owned farms, a new study this year by
the Washington-based Rural Coalition found that between 1982 and
1987, the rate of decline of black farms was 3.6 times that of
white farms.
   Between 1978 and 1987, the study found, the number of
black-owned farms declined 23 percent while the number of
white-owned farms dropped by only 6.6 percent. Of the nearly 10,000
black-owned farms that were lost during the decade, 92 percent were
in the South.
   ``Minority farmers ... are being plowed under,'' Espy said,
``and we think that through the policies of USDA and the Farmers
Home (Administration) ... they're being left for weeds.''
   Espy charged that the federal farm credit system has been
insensitive to the financial needs of minority farmers. He said the
switch in federal farm policy during the 1980s from loans to loan
guarantees was particularly harmful, because many commercial banks
won't make loans to minority farmers, even with government
guarantees.
   Espy and Fowler said they hope to incorporate their Minority
Farmers Rights Act into the 1990 farm bill, which will set the
nation's farm policy for the next five years. The Senate opened
debate on its version of the farm bill Thursday.
   The Espy-Fowler bill would establish policies in the Department
of Agriculture to end discrimination in the awarding of federal
farm benefits, create an affirmative action program within the
department, and establish an appeals process for discrimination
complaints.

<TEXT>
   A judge who four years ago gave a
priest probation for molesting altar boys said he would throw him
in prison if he was ever caught with children again. This week, the
judge kept his word.
   The Rev. Andrew Christian Andersen, convicted of 26 counts of
child molestation in 1986, was sentenced Wednesday to six years in
prison.
   ``I gave you a chance to straighten your life out. You let me
down,'' Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas told Andersen.
   The former parish priest was convicted four years ago of
molesting altar boys at St. Bonaventure Roman Catholic Church in
Huntington Beach.
   Cardenas placed Andersen on five years' probation but threatened
him with prison if he had unsupervised contact with children.
   Andersen was arrested March 12 in Albuquerque, N.M., for
investigation of kidnapping and attempted child molestation. Police
said he lured a 14-year-old boy into his car and fondled him. No
charges have been filed.
   Andersen's lawyer said the 38-year-old priest denies any
criminal wrongdoing in that case but admits he violated terms of
his probation.
   ``He thinks that he ended up breaking his agreement with
Cardenas so he got what was coming,'' said attorney William Monroe.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan may
have offered just the ingredient the administration needs to reach
a budget deal with Congress. But ultimately it could poison the
economy.
   One problem is that jittery investors are reading Greenspan's
pledge to lower interest rates in exchange for a budget agreement
as a sign that the Fed chief is caving in to political pressure and
abandoning the fight against inflation.
   Many economists, recalling the experience of the 1960s, fear
that the outcome of all the economic tinkering will be rising
inflation and weaker growth _ the worst of all possible worlds and
a prescription for the very recession the administration wants to
avoid.
   Financial markets, which normally rally on the promise of lower
interest rates, went into a funk after Greenspan's Wednesday
promise. Investors worried about his motivations in discussing
lower interest rates on a day when the government was reporting a
worrisome jump in consumer inflation.
   The Federal Reserve, as the protector of the nation's money
supply and key defender against inflation, is supposed to be above
the political fray. But the timing of Greenspan's comments raised
questions about whether the Fed chief is now worrying more about
his possible reappointment by President Bush next year than he is
about keeping inflation under control.
   The Bush administration has recently intensified its pressure on
the Greenspan Fed to relent and lower interest rates. The Federal
Reserve had been resisting those entreaties, contending that a dose
of high interest rates was needed to slow the economy and thus
bring inflation under control.
   Then suddenly last week, Greenspan took the unusual step of
announcing Fed intentions in advance, saying that the central bank
planned to ease credit slightly to offset overly cautious lending
practices by the nation's banks. Just a month ago, Greenspan had
said he could not detect any broadbased tightening by lenders.
   On Friday, the Fed did ease, moving to push a key interest rate,
the federal funds rate, down to 8 percent. It had been at 8.25
percent since December.
   Then this week in his twice-a-year appearance before Congress to
explain the Fed's monetary policy, Greenspan held out the promise
of further interest rate declines should Congress and the
administration agree to ``major, substantive, credible cuts in the
budget deficit.''
   Greenspan's words were hailed by the administration, which wants
Fed participation in any budget deal with Congress. Their fear is
that the $50 billion to $60 billion in spending cuts and tax
increases being contemplated to lower the budget deficit would take
a lot of momentum out of an economy that is already sputtering
along at near-recession levels.
   The economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew at
a sub-par 1.9 percent annual rate in the first three months of 1990
and by some measurements of employment as many as 16 states are in
a virtual recession at present.
   The administration sought and got Greenspan's assurance that he
would loosen monetary policy to offset the huge drop in spending
power that would come from a deficit deal. Lower interest rates, by
this reasoning, would give a boost to the economy by encouraging
more business and consumer borrowing.
   But what has economists concerned is that the weak growth is
occurring at a time when inflationary pressures are rising. The
Labor Department reported Wednesday that consumer prices shot up
0.5 percent in June and have been rising at an annual rate of 5.9
percent so far this year, the worst price performance since former
Fed Chairman Paul Volcker was fighting double-digit rates at the
beginning of the 1980s.
   Some economists worry that the nation may be on the verge of
another bout of stagflation _ the term coined in the 1970s to
describe a combination of slow economic growth, rising prices and
rising unemployment.
   In such instances, the Fed's ability to lower interest rates to
boost economic growth is constrained by the need to battle
inflation.
   In addition, the financial markets, looking at the inflation
numbers, may resist and demand even higher interest-rate premiums
for their investments.
   Also, policies even at the powerful Federal Reserve work with
uncertain lag times. And the ability to fine-tune monetary policy,
which is controlled by the Fed, and budgetary policy, controlled by
Congress and the administration, has not often been successful
before.
   Veteran Fed watchers say the last time there was an attempt at a
coordinated hike in tax revenues and cut in interest rates came
more than two decades ago.
   President Lyndon Johnson pressured then-Fed Chairman William
McChesney Martin to lower interest rates to offset the effects of a
10 percent tax surchage Congress enacted in 1968 to pay for the
Vietnam War.
   The tax increase was not enough to offset the stimulative
effects of the interest rate cuts, thus sending inflation
ratcheting upward and laying the groundwork for a recession which
began at the end of 1969, ending the nation's longest economic
recovery at just over nine years.
   The current recovery, which is in its eighth year, may be headed
for the same fate.
   ``There is a parallel between Martin's situation and Greenspan's
situation,'' said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston
&amp; Co., who has written two books on Fed policy. ``If you make a
deal with politicians, there is always the danger that you will end
up with the worst of both possible worlds. You will get higher
inflation and lower growth.''

   A rare rabbit found only in the Florida
Keys and named after Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner was added
to the federal endangered species list, government biologists said
Thursday.
   Only about 200 of the Lower Keys marsh rabbits are believed to
live on a few islands of the archipelago that extends from the
southern tip of Florida.
   The animal is the only rabbit among the 1,000 creatures on the
endangered species list, said U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service
biologist Michael Bentzien.
   But it joins 16 other animals from the islands _ including the
Key deer _ already classified as endangered, which is not
surprising, said Washington-based Fish &amp; Wildlife biologist Jay
Sheppard.
   ``There's only a small amount of habitat left,'' Sheppard said.
``And for almost all animals found on islands and isolated for a
period of a time, the rule of thumb is a lower (fertility) rate.''
   The dark brown, marsh-dwelling rabbits were only identified as a
separate spcecies in 1980, thanks to the work of the private
Conservation Agency and its President James Lazell.
   He in turn was financed by the Playboy Foundation and in
gratitude the rabbit's Latin name is Sylvilagus palustris hefneri,
after Hefner.
   The marsh rabbit's name was entered in the Federal Register on
June 21, and the protection goes into effect Saturday, 30 days
later, said Sheppard.
   The designation means that no development project funded or
authorized by the federal government may threaten the rabbits'
habitat, and no one may shoot, trap or harass the animals, said
Sheppard.
   The rabbit is not the only Florida animal to make the list as of
Saturday.
   The little-known Squirrel Chimney Cave shrimp, which lives only
in an underground sinkhole in Alachua County west of Gainesville,
also has won that protection.
   The unpigmented inch-long shrimp resembles the grass shrimp
often found along Florida rivers, but lacks eyes because of its
underground existence.

<HEAD>U.S. Victory in Cold War Painful for Workers Facing Layoffs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   By the end of the year, thousands of McDonnell
Douglas employees in cities such as Long Beach, Calif., and St.
Louis will be out of work, victims of the U.S. victory in the Cold
War.
   ``Turning swords into plowshares is not painless,'' Rep.
Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., said Thursday _ just four days after
McDonnell Douglas, the nation's largest military contractor,
announced it was laying off 17,000 employees.
   Mavroules and several other House Democrats have crafted
legislation to assist communities, businesses and workers who will
be hard hit by the certain cuts in defense spending.
   The legislation, formally known as ``The Economic Stabilization,
Adjustment and Defense Industry Conversion Act of 1990,'' is the
product of repeated attempts in Congress to produce a
financial-assistance package.
   The collapse of the Warsaw Pact as a military alliance and
demands at home to reduce military spending gave impetus to the
legislation. Mavroules, who chairs the House Armed Services
subcommittee on investigations, held a hearing on the package
Thursday.
   The legislation calls for using $200 million from the defense
budget for retraining workers, helping companies switch from
military to commercial production and providing grants to
communities, among other provisions.
   Existing economic-development programs, such as the Defense
Department's Office of Economic Adjustment, would be expanded to
handle the money with the president's Economic Stabilization and
Adjustment Council providing the oversight.
   Democrats believe the legislation must be approved this year.
   ``Congress tends to react to a crisis rather than planning
ahead,'' said Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, who testified before
the Armed Services panel and then oversaw her own subcommittee's
approval of a section of the economic conversion legislation.
   Oakar chairs the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs
subcommittee on economic stabilization.
   Mavroules said recent estimates from the Bush administration
indicate that the nation has 3.4 million people working in the
defense industry. About 30,000 have been laid off this year and the
number will likely grow as military spending decreases.
   President Bush has proposed spending $307 billion on defense in
the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, but the Senate Armed Services
Committee has approved $289 billion. The House Armed Services
Committee is scheduled to craft a bill beginning next week based on
a budget of $283 billion.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., whose
constituents will be affected by the McDonnell Douglas layoffs,
criticized the administration for rejecting the concept of economic
assistance.
   ``Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney said, and I quote, `We
have enough to do just figuring out how to cut the defense budget;
we are not spending lots of time thinking about conversion.'''
   Gephardt said that assessment was ``irresponsible, unfair and
naive.''
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., who also testified before the
panel, said there was little enthusiasm for the economic-assistance
plan in the Senate, where lawmakers feel uneasy about singling out
defense when other industries are also facing severe problems.
   Dr. Robert M. Rauner, director of the Defense Department's
Office of Economic Adjustment, said the administration opposes the
House legislation because it duplicates existing efforts and would
be costly.
   ``The existing economic adjustment program is comprehensive and
coordinated,'' Rauner said. ``It is tailored to help meet local
needs.''

<TEXT>
   East Germany checked the pulse of its economy
Thursday and released a grim diagnosis: industrial production has
plunged and at least 9 percent of its workers have lost all or part
of their wages.
   Industrial production fell by 15 percent in June and half a
million workers have had their hours and salaries slashed since
July 1, when the nation became a free market and merged its economy
with West Germany's.
   The figures follow by one day the government's estimate that up
to 40,000 East Germans have been thrown out of work weekly since
the economic merger.
   As it lurches through its first weeks of the free market, East
German lawmakers debated Thursday how to pull the country through
its final months as a nation.
   The country is facing a $38.6 billion deficit in the budget for
the second half of the year. The budget will be the country's last
before East Germany unites with West Germany in December.
   While lawmakers debated the budget, about 2,500 uniformed police
officers gathered in front of the Parliament building to demand
higher wages to cope with rising food costs.
   ``Penalize the guilty, not us,'' read a banner carried by the
demonstrators, who hooted and jeered when Interior Minister
Peter-Michael Diestel told the group the country has no money.
   Labor Minister Regine Hildebrandt told a news conference that
about 500,000 East German workers have had their hours and wages
slashed since July 1.
   The workers normally would have been laid off, but are being
kept in their factories under a $1.2 billion program financed by
West Germany.
   Under the program, workers who normally would be targeted for
layoffs are being paid about 60 percent of their salaries to remain
in the factories, where they are to receive training for other jobs.
   On Wednesday, the government announced that unemployment was at
223,876 in mid-June, about 2.7 percent of the 8 million East German
workers. That was up from 30,000 jobless in March.
   Together, the number of workers who have either lost their jobs
or are in the subsidized jobs program is at least 724,000, or about
9 percent of the workforce.
   However, the actual jobless figure is likely much higher than
the most recent figures from mid-June. The government estimated
Wednesday that 30,000 to 40,000 workers have been thrown out of
work each week this month.
   The government statistics office announced Thursday that
industrial production was down 15.1 percent in June from the same
time a year earlier, and down 7.3 percent during the first six
months of this year compared with the same period last year.
   Economists say unemployment could reach 3 million within a year
as uncompetitive East German companies go bankrupt, unable to make
the adjustment from a centrally planned economy to a free market.
   On Tuesday, the government said 2,400 of the country's 8,000
companies _ 30 percent _ were unable to pay their bills.
   Arno Donda, statistics office chief, also said that living costs
for East Germans rose 12.1 percent in June compared with June 1989.
   Like the industrial production figure, that statistic was
recorded before the July 1 economic merger, when East Germany's
borders were opened to Western products, prices for basic
necessities skyrocketed, and East German enterprises felt the full
brunt of Western competition.
   The East German Parliament failed to iron out a feud over
whether to merge with West Germany a day before all-German
elections expected on Dec. 2 or immediately after the vote.
   East German lawmakers will meet in a special session on Sunday
and are expected to decide on a date then.
   Also Thursday, in a gesture of good will, Poland removed the
last stretch of barbed wire on its side of the border with East
Germany, Polish TV news reported.
   The move came two days after the two Germanys pledged to respect
the postwar border with Poland after German unification.

<HEAD>House Leaders Dismiss Complaint on Campaign Financing Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic House leaders on Thursday dismissed
a private group's charges that they are blocking action on campaign
finance reform because they are addicted to the current system.
   Rep. Al Swift, chairman of the the Elections subcommittee and a
task force on campaign finance reform, said the Democrats intend to
send a proposal to the floor as soon as they work out conflicts
among themselves.
   ``We can't do it to the timetable of advocates outside the
institution who say we want it by noon Tuesday,'' he said.
   Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group founded in 1971 by
Ralph Nader, said eight House leaders with direct influence on the
reform process received an average of $337,233 each from political
action committees in 1988 _ 61 percent of all their campaign
contributions. The group called that ``a gross conflict of
interest.''
   The eight lawmakers examined in the report were House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.; Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.;
Majority Whip Bill Gray, D-Pa.; Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Vic
Fazio of California, the chairman and vice chairman of the
Democratic Caucus; chief deputy whip David Bonior, D-Mich.; Beryl
Anthony of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee; and Swift, D-Wash.
   Public Citizen said a larger group of 148 Democratic House
leaders, including deputy whips and chairmen of committees and
subcommittees, received average PAC contributions of $198,161 each
in 1988 _ 52 percent of their warchests.
   By contrast, the group said, Republican challengers averaged
$11,586 each _ only 11 percent of their funds.
   Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, said the Democrats
``seem intent on killing campaign reform legislation this year.
Perhaps one of the reasons is that they are addicted to PAC funds
and to the current system.''
   Jeff Biggs, a Foley spokesman, said the leadership wants very
much to have a bill on the floor this year and discussions are
continuing. ``The suggestion that somehow this has all ground to a
halt is not true,'' he said.
   The House and the Senate have been unable so far to agree on a
bipartisan approach to campaign finance reform. Proposals in both
chambers are in flux.
   The Public Citizen report said PACs ``migrate to legislative
decision-makers and PAC dollars are very easy to raise ... It is
little surprise then that the leadership is endorsing PAC reform
which would do little more than codify the status quo.''
   The group said that plan, proposed by Swift, would restrict PACs
with fewer contributors but permit those with many small
contributors to continue business as usual. In addition, Public
Citizen said, the plan puts no aggregate cap on PAC receipts and
does not provide for public financing.
   A Swift aide, however, said the final bill is expected to
restrict PAC contributions to a certain percentage or dollar amount
of a candidate's warchest.
   Swift said PACs are the one area in which Public Citizen's
concerns have not yet been met. He said the group has praised two
other elements of his proposal _ closing a loophole that permits
virtually unlimited spending by parties and voluntary overall
spending limits with incentives to comply.
   ``Positive reinforcement is not one of the tools they use very
often,'' Swift said of the Nader group. ``These aren't ivory tower
boys. These are people who know how to fight in the street. They
are trying to twist our arm as hard as they can.''

<TEXT>
   Japan will free up a five-year, $5.4 billion loan
package to China that was frozen after last year's bloody crackdown
on pro-democracy demonstrators, the Japanese Embassy said Thursday.
   Former Japanese foreign minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told China's
foreign minister, Qian Qichen, that the first payment of $405
million would be made in September, followed by another of the same
amount in February.
   Japan's deputy foreign minister, Hisashi Owada, had told Qian
earlier this week that Japan planned to gradually resume lending,
but Thursday's announcement was the first indication of the
timetable for China recieving the funds.
   The loan package is for 42 projects involving railways,
telecommunications, ports, power plants, airports, fertilizer
plants, highways and sewage systems.
   Freezing the loan package was part of Japan's sanctions against
China after the army attack on pro-democracy protestors in June of
1989.
   The seven industrialized powers, in an economic summit in
Houston last week, decided to maintain economic sanctions imposed
against China after it killed hundreds, perhaps thousands of
unarmed civilians in crushing a popular democracy movement.
   But the summit leaders gave Japan tacit approval to resume
lending, which Japan says is in the interest of regional stability.

   Red Cross rescuers dodged sniper fire
Thursday to remove 11 bloated bodies from a hilltop village in
south Lebanon where pro-Iranian militiamen and Syrian-backed rivals
have fought for four days.
   Police said two people were killed and five wounded in the
fighting Thursday. That raised the casualty toll to 66 people
killed and 223 wounded since Monday when the battles erupted just
north of Israel's self-designated security zone.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said the
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the more secular
Amal agreed to observe a brief ``humanitarian truce'' Thursday
afternoon to allow the rescuers into Iqlim al-Tuffah, or Apple
Province.
   But when the convoy of five Lebanese Red Cross ambulances and
two Red Cross cars rolled into Jarjou, shells rained on the
embattled hilltop village and the rescuers pulled out empty-handed,
police said.
   An hour later, the fighting ebbed into sporadic sniper fire and
the rescuers, wearing masks because of the heavy stench of death,
entered Jarjou again.
   They wrapped 11 bodies in plastic bags and piled them in the
ambulances. The fighting suddenly escalated and the rescuers sped
out in the ambulances, leaving behind four corpses.
   By mid-afternoon the rugged mountains above Sidon, provincial
capital of south Lebanon, were shaking with artillery and rocket
blasts. It was unclear when the rescuers will be able to bring out
the remaining bodies.
   Amal and Hezbollah gunners battled with howitzers, mortars and
multi-barreled rocket-launchers. Caught in the middle were
Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas manning a 4-mile-long
buffer between Amal and Hezbollah.
   The 600-strong PLO force had deployed Tuesday to end the
inter-Shiite bloodbath. On Wednesday, six guerrillas were wounded
when Hezbollah fired at their positions. One of the victims died in
hospital Thursday, police said.
   There were no casualties among the guerrillas in Thursday's
duels.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting on and off for three years
for mastery of the 1.2 million Shiites who make up Lebanon's
largest sect.
   More than 1,100 people have been killed and nearly 3,400 wounded
in the inconclusive showdown.
   The hostilities in the south appeared to be spreading slowly to
the capital, Beirut, where reprisal kidnappings were reported
during the night.
   Police said masked gunmen from Amal and Hezbollah raided houses
in west and south Beirut and abducted at least 40 people belonging
to the rival groups.
   Militiamen of the two parties also took to the streets before
dawn as tension heightened, but they fled when Syrian troops in
charge of security in the capital's Moslem sector moved in to
prevent gunplay.
   Beirut's independent newspaper An-Nahar said the PLO has lifted
an ultimatum for Hezbollah to withdraw from Jarjou. PLO chief
Yasser Arafat's representative in south Lebanon, Zeid Webe, said
Wednesday that if Hezbollah did not withdraw in 24 hours, it will
be evicted.
   Hezbollah, in a statement, warned of ``grave consequences
resulting from the unjustified Palestinian expansion in south
Lebanon.''
   The PLO disengagement force is drawn mainly from Arafat's
mainstream Fatah faction. It intervened to prevent Hezbollah from
seizing Nabatiyeh, the main Shiite town in the central sector of
south Lebanon, or thrusting west toward the Mediterranean.
   Hezbollah needs the sea outlet to bring in supplies from Iran.

   Explosions ripped through a chemical plant
Thursday, igniting a fire and injuring at least 38 people,
officials said.
   Flames engulfed the BASF plant, a four-story, brick building
that covers most of a city block on the north side. The blast
shattered windows in neighboring homes and businesses.
   Ben Diedenhofer, a production manager, was in a lab overlooking
the plant's resin building when the first explosion occurred about
2:15 p.m.
   ``It blew out all the windows. The whole resin building was
engulfed in flames,'' Diedenhofer said.
   ``I couldn't get in to help anyone. I saw one person hanging on
to the building. I was able to get him off,'' he said.
   Diedenhofer said there was a second explosion about a half hour
later. He said about 200 people work at the plant, which makes
linings for cans.
   ``I looked out a window and I could see a huge ball of fire and
smoke, it must have been 100 - 150 feet in the air,'' said Dan
Delaney, who works near the chemical plant. ``Everybody was running
down the street ... just getting out of there as fast as they
could.''
   ``Police and firemen are all around, fighting the blaze. They
just keep getting small explosions and more fireballs shooting up
in the air,'' he said.
   Rescue workers throughout Hamilton County and from Cincinnati
suburbs in northern Kentucky responded. The injured were taken to
four hospitals.
   At least 19 people were taken to Bethesda Hospital with minor
injuries, said spokeswoman Julie Whiteley.
   The University of Cincinnati Hospital received 16 patients with
burns, broken bones, cuts and bruises, said spokesman David Bracey.
Four were in critical condition.
   At least one victim was at Good Samaritan Hospital, said
spokeswoman Jackie Heinitz.
   Five people were brought to Jewish Hospital, spokeswoman Pat
Seger said, but she said none of the patients were in the plant.
Ms. Seger said two people were injured by shattered glass at a
supermarket.

Exchange</HEAD>

   California congressmen on Thursday praised a
proposed swap of federal land near Los Angeles to entertainer Bob
Hope for potential parkland acreage despite complaints the deal was
ramrodded through the National Park Service.
   ``I, too, dislike seeing a career park service official
overruled by a political appointee,'' Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson,
D-Calif., testified at a House subcommittee hearing into federal
land trades. ``But that shouldn't be used as a reason to oppose the
trade.''
   Even Rep. George A. Miller, D-Calif., long a critic of federal
land trade practices, said the deal has its good points.
   The deal would involve the trade of 59 acres of federal land
near Los Angeles for 5,600 acres in the Santa Monica Mountains
National Recreation Area. Key to the deal is a 2,300-acre tract,
known as Jordan Ranch, owned by Hope.
   Hope wants to build houses and a PGA Tour golf course on the
property, which the National Park Service has previously said it
wants to acquire. In order to make the site easily accessible to
the Ventura Freeway, Hope needs to build a road through federal
land.
   The proposed trade would give Hope 59 acres of park service land
so he could build the road. In exchange, he would give the park
service 864 acres from a parcel he owns and sell at bargain prices
or give the remaining 4,772 acre he owns on four parcels to a state
land conservancy.
   Beilenson, Rep. Howard L. Berman, D-Calif., and other supporters
say the proposed acquisition, the largest single parkland
acquisition in Southern California in two decades, probably would
not be accomplished otherwise because of the soaring real estate
market and the lack of federal acquisition dollars.
   They say the deal would protect wildlife, including eagles and
mountain lions, native oaks, and provide a corridor for wildlife to
roam from the mountains to the Pacific coast.
   The congressmen testified at a hearing of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on environment, chaired by Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla. The hearing is the second in a series by the subcommittee
on the federal practice of acquiring desired federal lands through
exchanges rather than purchases. The practice began more widespread
during the Reagan administration.
   Miller and others contend public interests are inadequately
protected because the deals are done in secret. Critics say also
that the Interior Department risks being fleeced by sophisticated
developers because of a lack of safeguards assuring trades are fair.
   Critics of this particular deal, including Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., say the park service should not be promoting private land
development interests, especially since the park service wanted the
Jordan Ranch land.
   Synar tried to demonstrate that department employees had
originally opposed the deal three years ago, only to be overruled
by a political appointee, William P. Horn, assistant secretary for
fish, wildlife and parks.

<HEAD>Quayle Raises Fresh Veto Threat on Job Discrimination Bill</HEAD>

   Vice President Dan Quayle said Thursday the
president will veto a Senate-passed bill to combat job bias unless
it is purged of provisions the administration contends invite
hiring quotas. House sponsors left the door open to modest changes.
   ``The administration is not going to have a quota bill crammed
down its throat disguised as a civil rights bill,'' Quayle said the
morning after the Senate passed the bill.
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, said he
believed there were enough votes on the House floor to pass the
bill without changes, even if the administration was ``still
screaming about quotas.''
   But he and other Democrats suggested the bill could be altered.
   One Democratic sponsor, Don Edwards of California, said, ``We're
going to listen respectfully'' to any administration proposals.
``We're going to be discussing one or two items that might make
them feel a little better.''
   Republicans suggested that Democratic willingness to dicker over
the provisions could signal concern about the chances of overriding
a Bush veto.
   ``It's obvious that 34 votes are enough to sustain a veto,''
said Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., speaking of the Senate
margin.
   Democratic leaders said the bill _ which tops the civil rights
movement's congressional list _ most likely would clear its final
committee hurdle in the House on Tuesday without changes.
   But House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said it most likely
would not reach the House floor until September because of a logjam
of bills awaiting action.
   The bill would effectively overturn five Supreme Court decisions
last year that civil rights leaders see as setbacks for their
movement.
   Provisions range from banning racial discrimination in the
workplace to allowing victims to seek punitive damages in the most
severe discrimination cases.
   The sharpest clashes surround a provision that would make it
easier to challenge hiring practices at companies where the work
force does not mirror the ethnic makeup of the local labor pool.
   Until last year, it was up to employers who were challenged to
justify their hiring practices on the basis of business necessity.
A high court ruling last year put the burden of proof on those who
file the suits to show the hiring motive was other than business
necessity.
   The bill would again put the burden on employers.
   The administration maintains that the business-necessity
language, along with damages provisions, would attract lawsuits and
spur employers to adopt their own unofficial hiring quotas as a
defensive measure to keep out of court.
   Bush has said repeatedly that he wants legislation to combat
discrimination in the workplace but will not sign a bill that would
lead to hiring quotas.
   Quayle, meeting with reporters in San Antonio, Texas, said major
surgery would be needed before Bush could sign the legislation
passed Wednesday night by the Senate.
   He said there would be enough votes to sustain a veto if the
measure arrives on the president's desk in unaltered form.
   Brooks, the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said he expected the panel to approve the bill without
any changes on Tuesday but left the door open to negotiations.
   ``They haven't worked out any compromise with me or with Mr.
Edwards,'' Brooks said. ``I want it written down. I want to take a
look at their suggestions.''
   Senate sponsor Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Wednesday night
he was encouraged by the 65 votes the measure received _ two short
of the number needed to override. But Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill.,
said he doubted that it would be easy to switch the votes of two
senators.
   Hyde also said he believed that Senate passage of the measure
guaranteed that employer groups ``will start lobbying and do so
with a vengeance.''

   The explosion Thursday at the BASF chemical
plant shattered windows up to four blocks away and sent a cloud of
black smoke drifting over Xavier University, where classes were
called off for the day.
   It caused a momentary panic in the residential neighborhood near
the plant.
   ``I was sitting in my living room talking on the telephone, and
it blew me right out of my chair. I thought somebody threw a
bomb,'' said Dorothy Douglas, who lives about a quarter mile from
the building.
   ``I heard a big boom and thought a car had hit the building.
Then I looked up and glass was falling every which way,'' said
Dilsey Freeman, a barber at the Curtis Styles Unlimited shop.
   ``Two little kids were running past, and they were cut by the
glass and they were bleeding.''
   Flames engulfed the four-story, brick BASF building, which
covered most of a city block. Dozens of workers at the plant were
injured.
   Dan Delaney, who works near the plant, said he saw a huge ball
of fire and smoke out his office window.
   ``Shortly thereafter, everybody was running down the street, out
of the building to get out, sort of in a panic, just getting out of
there as fast as they could,'' Delaney said.
   The explosion knocked out electrical power and broke windows on
the Xavier campus, about four blocks from the explosion site, said
Xavier spokesman Charlie Carey.
   ``It shook the building,'' Carey said. ``It knocked out power
immediately.''
   Smoke from the explosion drifted over campus for about an hour
before it began to dissipate, he said.
   Carey said the campus was cleared of students and staff, and
remaining afternoon and night classes were canceled. Exams
scheduled for Thursday night were rescheduled for Friday night,
Carey said.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Abolishes Privileges for Officials in Russian Republic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Russian federation president Boris N. Yeltsin, who
won popular support by denouncing the privileges enjoyed by the
ruling elite, has abolished those luxuries for the republic's
officials, Tass reported Thursday.
   The decree did not appear to apply to thousands of high-ranking
officials of the national government and Communist Party who live
and work in Moscow, which is both the capital of the Soviet Union
and the Russian federation, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   The decree from the presidium of the Russian parliament that was
signed by Yeltsin abolished all kinds and forms of privileges to
officials in the Russian federation as of Aug. 1, saying they
``violate social justice,'' the official news agency reported.
   Abolished were privileges ``on power, on unearned payments, on
undeserved benefits, (and) on undeserved and unearned comfortable
working and living conditions of organizations, enterprises,
offices and workers of the apparatus of state organs.''
   It said that as of Aug. 1, all legislative acts, resolutions,
instructions and regulations directly or indirectly ensuring
privileges to officials, ``no matter what posts they hold,'' will
be considered invalid.
   Special food and clothing stores, sleek black limousines, fancy
homes and high-quality medical care for the government and party
elite have generated massive public resentment in a country where
there are shortages of housing, food and consumer goods.
   Yeltsin built his election campaign to the national parliament
on the issue last year and was extremely popular because of it.
   There was no explanation why the 2-day-old decree, which was
signed Tuesday, was released only by Tass on Thursday. The Russian
parliament said in the document the mass media had 10 days to
publish it.
   In February, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev took some
action against the privileged elite by deciding the country's
current and former leaders _ excepting himself and Premier Nikolai
I. Ryzhkov _ were no longer entitled to luxuries such as country
houses.
   Many retired members of the Communist Party Politburo _ some in
their 90s _ were ordered to move out. They also lost the right to
their household workers, cars and special government food stores.
   Under public pressure, Gorbachev last year reluctantly agreed to
endorse an attack on the privileges given the Soviet elite.
   Many of the Soviet elite's country houses, known as dachas, are
believed to feature tennis courts, private swimming pools and
fountains. On the outskirts of Moscow, they are surrounded by
fences and guards.

   The Defense Department still believes the
tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey assault transport aircraft isn't worth
buying despite conclusions of a study showing long-term cost
advantages over helicopters, a top official said Thursday.
   David Chu, assistant defense secretary for program analysis and
evaluation, told the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee
that the study by the Institute for Defense Analyses assumes the
department will have more money to purchase assault transports than
it will actually have.
   That extra money would buy more assault transport capability
than the Marine Corps, primary user of the V-22 for attacking
defended beaches, would need, Chu said.
   The department must ``figure out how to accomplish its most
important missions _ perhaps less well than would be possible with
more resources _ while still achieving substantial savings,'' he
said.
   ``The alternative helicopter forces _ perhaps in smaller numbers
at lower investment and operating costs _ can perform the
higher-priority DoD missions at acceptable levels.''
   The institute's study acknowledged the higher initial cost of
the V-22 and said that would be offset by lower operating costs.
Chu, however, said those savings in operating costs ``are dubious
and would accrue gradually over many years, to the extent that they
occur at all.''
   As an example, he said the institute assumed one helicopter, the
CH-47M, could be used only 1.7 hours per day, but Army data on a
related model, the CH-47D, suggest availability of four hours per
day.
   ``Moreover, the IDA study assumes we can change operational
practices to play to the V-22's major strengths but downplays the
advantages of the larger helicopters in the alternative forces,''
Chu said.
   Chu said the Ospreys would cost about $3.7 billion more, during
fiscal years 1991 through 1997, than Secretary of the Navy H.
Lawrence Garrett III recommended be spent on medium airlift.
   Released three weeks ago, the institute's study was ballyhooed
by congressional backers of the aircraft, which received no
production money for the current year after Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney said he wanted to kill it.
   Congress ordered the study, but the Pentagon chose the
institute, a non-profit group with close ties to the Pentagon, to
perform it.
   Cheney has cited the case of the Osprey as illustrating the
difficulty of killing any program even when many in Congress cry
for smaller defense budgets.
   With its twin end-of-wing propellers pointed up, the Osprey can
take off like a helicopter, and then can rotate the propellers to
point forward and fly like a plane faster and farther than
helicopters.
   Its prime contractors are Boeing Helicopters, a suburban
Philadelphia division of Boeing Co.; and Bell Helicopter Textron of
Fort Worth, Texas.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized $238 million
in Osprey research and development money for the new fiscal year
beginning Oct 1. That money would have to be made available in an
appropriations bill, and backers hope to get production funds as
well.

<HEAD>Spring Rise in Farm Milk Prices Pushed Up Retail Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Milk prices at the farm declined last winter
but regained some of their lost ground during the spring. That also
pushed up consumer prices, an Agriculture Department report said
Thursday.
   ``However, continued substantial growth in milk production and
reductions in probably swollen user inventories of non-fat dry milk
likely will limit further advances in milk and dairy product
prices,'' the report said.
   Milk production was up more than 2 percent during the April-June
quarter from year-earlier levels. The number of cows held about
steady but milk output per cow was up.
   ``High farm milk prices since 1989 spurred the expansion,
although financial caution and forage concerns have restrained
growth,'' the report said.
   Milk production in the second half of 1990 probably will rise
about 3 percent from a year earlier, the report said. That would
raise total 1990 milk output by about 2 percent from last year.
   If wholesale prices hold relatively steady for the rest of 1990,
analysts said the average price increase for farm milk prices may
be in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent for the entire year.
   The overall retail prices of dairy products _ including milk,
cheese, butter and other products _ were up about 10 percent from a
year earlier during the second quarter as widening price spreads
between producers and consumers more than matched the increase in
farm milk prices.
   ``Retail prices during the rest of 1990 likely will remain near
recent levels, and the increases from 1989 are expected to average
8 percent to 10 percent for the year,'' the report said.

   Pat Nixon, the shy, reclusive, former
first lady, made a rare public appearance Thursday, walking with
her husband to center stage at the dedication of his library.
   She got the longest applause of all. President Bush called her
``a mirror of America's heart and love.''
   Mrs. Nixon, at 78, has seldom been seen in public since she
moved with her husband to California after he resigned the
presidency in 1974. Since then, the Nixons have moved to a large
estate in New Jersey. There, too, neighbors seldom see her.
   Nearly all of the public mention of the former first lady in
recent years has been her frequent hospitalizations. She suffered a
major stroke in 1977 that left her paralyzed on one side and a
milder one in 1983.
   Still, she shows few effects. She walks with a firm step and
talks without any trace of impairment.
   Her daughter, Julie Nixon Eisenhower, said her mother spends a
good deal of time in her garden. However, the Nixons are moving out
of their house in Saddle River, N.J., to a nearby condominium
apartment because taking care of a large garden has become too much
for her.
   Nixon met his wife, the former Thelma Catherine Ryan, during an
acting tryout when he was a young lawyer in Whittier, Calif., and
she was a school teacher. He said for him it was a case of love at
first sight.
   She was given the nickname Pat by her father and it stuck. They
celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary last month.
   In his speech, President Bush praised her as ``a gracious first
lady who ranks among the most admired women of post-war America.''
   The president said that during her time in the White House, Mrs.
Nixon ``championed the Right To Read program, and helped bring the
Parks To People program to the disadvantaged.'' He said that Mrs.
Nixon was ``our most widely traveled first lady.'' With Nixon she
visited five continents and 22 nations.
   ``When, in 1958, foreign mobs stoned the Nixon's car she was, an
observer said, `stronger than any man.'''
   The president wound up his reference with these words: ``Mrs.
Nixon, the Secret Service (code-named) you `Starlight.' Your
husband has said it best; you fit that name to a T.''
   At that point Nixon smiled and nodded.

<HEAD>Most Farmers Would Back Changes in Law to Protect Environment:
Poll</HEAD>
<NOTE>For Release 6:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of farmers would support changes in
federal law to help protect the nation's environment, a survey by a
national conservation group said Thursday.
   Officials of the American Farmland Trust said the survey
provided ``strong evidence that farmers are more supportive of
environmentally sound farming practices than their Washington
lobbyists admit.''
   The survey results were released as the Senate began debate on
the 1990 farm bill, a complex measure that will guide U.S. farm
programs and policy for the next five years.
   In recent months, the AFT said, much of the debate about farm
bill amendments has centered on alleged farmer resistance to
changes in federal law to help clean up the environment, including
reduced use of chemicals and fertilizers.
   According to the survey, more than 70 percent of about 1,000
farmers interviewed in 22 states were ``interested in participating
in a federal cost-sharing program that would reduce contamination
of water through the adoption of new farm management practices.''
   Further, the AFT said, majorities of these farmers approve of
pesticide and fertilizer use plans that would help farmers
economize on the use of these materials.
   Ralph Grossi, president of AFT, a non-profit Washington-based
membership organization, said he gave House and Senate agriculture
committees high marks for their efforts to protect wetlands and set
the right course on water quality planning and flexible cropland
use.
   But he added, ``I give them very low marks on long-term soil
protection, promotion of environmentally sustainable farming, and
protection of farmland from urban encroachment.''
   The survey and its analysis was conducted for AFT by a team at
Northern Illinois University. It was based on about 1,000
interviews from a data base of 1,435, said spokesman David Dyer.
The survey was said to have a margin error of approximately 5
percent.
   The data base was selected randomly from 42,860 producers of six
major federally supported commodities _ corn, wheat, rice, cotton,
peanuts and milk _ in 100 counties of 22 states.
   Dyer said the survey was designed to reflect national attitudes.
It did not show state breakdowns.
   The states where the survey was conducted are Alabama, Arkansas,
California, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana,
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, New
York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.

   Bright, yellow happy-face pins emblazoned
with the governor's name are part of a public service campaign,
officials say. But some state employees complain the buttons are
for his re-election campaign.
   The lapel buttons, which also feature the slogan ``YES, WE
CAN!,'' are part of a campaign organized by Gov. William Donald
Schaefer's office to encourage Maryland's 70,000 state employees to
offer the public service with a smile.
   Some state employees complained that they were being used in an
election year.
   ``It certainly did appear that it was politically motivated,''
William Bolander, executive director of the state chapter of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said
Thursday.
   Bolander said he was not blaming the Democratic governor, who
may not have had anything to do with putting his name on the pins.
   Bolander said he also supports the campaign to improve service
to the public.
   ``It's just the way you go about it,'' he said. ``You could get
that message across without having the governor's name attached to
everything.''
   ``This has absolutely no political overtones whatsoever,''
Schaefer press secretary Paul Schurick said angrily. ``I am deeply
insulted by anyone who questions the motives of a campaign to
improve public service.''
   Schaefer said he wasn't worried about the complaints because
``only the press'' is upset about the buttons.
   ``It's not a campaign gimmick'' but an attempt to make state
employees better public servants, he said.
   ``Just putting a button on ... there's nothing wrong with
that,'' Schaefer said.
   Schurick said having Schaefer's name on the button is in keeping
with the policy he has followed for 19 years as mayor of Baltimore
and governor.
   ``The governor has made a career out of Don Schaefer. He is
well-known for high-profile campaigns of all kinds with his name
attached,'' Schurick said.
   ``The governor cannot stop being governor just because it's an
election year,'' he said.
   Most of the complaints came from employees of the Department of
General Services, who were told in a July 6 memo: ``All DGS
employees are to wear their `YES WE CAN' buttons during working
hours.''
   Robert B. Silver, who wrote the memo, said it was a request, not
an order.
   ``If they choose not to wear the buttons, there is no
disciplinary action that's going to be taken,'' he said.
   William Seth Shepard, who is seeking the Republican nomination
for governor, said incumbents such as Schaefer should show
``self-restraint'' in putting their names on billboards, buttons
and other paraphernalia purportedly promoting the state.
   Fred Griisser, a real estate agent and gun control foe trying to
upset Schaefer in the Democratic primary, said it was
``inappropriate'' for state workers to be told to wear the buttons.
   ``It obviously looks like they are expected to promote him for
the office,'' he said.

<HEAD>Group Says Voters Willing to Pay for Better Child Health Care</HEAD>

   Most American voters are willing to pay higher
taxes to fund better child health care programs, according to a
study released Thursday by a children's advocacy group.
   The report was released by the National Association of
Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions as part of its
campaign to make children a major issue in the 1990 elections.
   ``The American people are profoundly interested in their kids
and the kids of this country,'' said Robert Sweeney, president of
the group.
   The study, ``Kids' Clout: Americans' Attitudes on Children's
Issues,'' indicated that 59 percent of those polled are willing to
have their taxes raised the estimated $100 annually it would take
to guarantee health care for all uninsured children.
   Two-thirds of the people asked said they would be more likely to
vote for candidates who favor increased spending for children's
health care programs, even if it meant a tax hike.
   Among occasional voters, 85 percent said they would be more
likely to vote if they thought it would have a significant impact
on the health and welfare of American children, according to the
study.
   The study is the result of a June 9-17 telephone survey of 1,000
adult Americans conducted by Washington-based Penn &amp; Schoen. The
poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percent.
   Association officials are using the study's findings to provide
voters with information about the status of children's health. The
group also is urging voters to press candidates to bring children's
health care issues onto their platforms.
   ``For too long, children have been seen and not heard at
election time when we decide this nation's future course,'' said
Jon Vice, chairman and president of Children's Hospital in
Wisconsin.
   The campaign, ``I care for kids _ and I vote,'' aims to increase
funds allocated to health care programs for children, such as
Medicaid, by having the American public push the issue among
candidates.
   The association's campaign includes bumper stickers, buttons,
booklets and handbooks, and a telephone hotline.
   The association of children's hospital, a non-profit group
founded in 1968, promotes the well-being of children through
advocacy, research and education.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Insist on Purge of Salvadoran Military
^By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE
^Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite El Salvador's intention to prod peace
talks past the sticky subject of an armed forces' overhaul, leftist
rebels say they will insist on a purge of officers they allege are
responsible for human rights abuses.
   The two sides meet Friday in Costa Rica for a third round of
U.N.-mediated peace talks that began in Venezuela in May.
   Guerrilla leaders say they are preparing a major offensive,
perhaps on the scale of November's push, if the new talks make no
progress.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, has
fought U.S.-backed governments since 1979. The war has killed an
estimated 72,000 people.
   ``There is a sector of the armed forces that must pay the bill
for so much oppression imposed on the country,'' guerrilla
commander Schafik Handal, the chief rebel negotiator, said in an
interview with The Associated Press at the rebels' Mexico City
office.
   Handal rejected the government's call to a cease-fire while
negotiations proceed.
   ``First, there must be agreements on how to demilitarize
Salvadoran society. If we halt military pressure, recalcitrant
elements would feel free to embark on a bloodbath like that of the
early 1980s,'' he said.
   During those years, troops and military-linked death squads
summarily executed about 30,000 suspected leftists, according to
international rights groups. No officer has been convicted or tried
for such a crime.
   The U.S. Congress, which has financed the government war effort,
intends to reduce and condition military aid for the 1991 financial
year, which begins in October. Draft legislation makes disbursement
of some funds dependent on progress in peace talks and on
successful prosecution of the army men responsible for November's
massacre of six Jesuit priest-educators.
   Some legislators echoed the guerrillas' demand for a purge. Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said this week about 50 upper-echelon
officers should be removed. He predicted that the war would go on
for years in the absence of drastic military reform.
   ``Fifty seems to us a low number,'' said Handal. Major guerrilla
leaders have mentioned the figure 200 when estimating how many
officers should be purged.
   ``We do not reject the idea of purifying our institution. The
armed forces, like any other insitution is subject to evolution, to
improvement,'' said Gen. Humberto Larios, the defense minister, in
a recent interview. But he insisted the military must do the
weeding-out.
   ``We are purifying ourselves,'' he said.
   Handal replied, ``If Larios maintains that the army is being
constantly `purified' and nevertheless it continues to play the
role of repressor, then it's obvious that `purification' is not
enough to clean it up. It should be abolished flat-out, which is
our conclusion.''
   The FMLN proposes that accords on gradual ``demilitarization,''
which would include its own disappearance as a fighting force,
conclude with abolishment of the armed forces.
   The rebels point to Costa Rica, which abolished its army in 1949
and is the only Central American nation to enjoy in recent decades
a stable and functioning democracy.
   A civilian-led police force would ensure law and order in a
demilitarized El Salvador, according to the FMLN proposal.
   Larios and other military chiefs bristle at idea of their
institution disappearing.
   ``The continued existence of the armed forces is not a subject
of discussion,'' President Alfredo Cristiani said after last
month's five-day round of talks in Mexico.
   That session dealt almost exclusively with the military, and
produced no argeement.
   The agenda worked out in Venezuela also includes rights;
judicial, electoral and constitutional reform; and means of
international verification of compliance with eventual accords.
   Cristiani says prospects for agreement on those points are good.
   The guerrillas say accords on other issues would be moot in the
absence of agreement on military overhaul.

<HEAD>Police Charge Arts Patron With Insurance Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WYNDMOOR, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man known as an arts patron and
philanthropist was arrested at his estate in the Philadelphia
suburbs and charged in a $15 million insurance scam.
   Richard Scholl, 36, who recently founded the Philadelphia
Philanthropic Opera Company, was charged Wednesday with grand
larceny by detectives from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office
in New York.
   Also arrested was Roy Hatch, 42, who lived with Scholl. A third
man, Salvatore DiTrapani, 43, was arrested at his home in Hazlet,
N.J.
   New York City District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau issued a
statement saying the three men pocketed liability insurance
premiums for several major New York law and accounting firms
starting in 1986.
   Officers also executed search warrants at local banks where they
believed Scholl rented safe deposit boxes, according to Thomas
Jackson, supervising investigator for the Morgenthau's office.
   Jackson, one of the arresting officers, said Scholl's 20-room
house, purchased in 1986 for $680,000, was filled with antique
furniture and artwork.
   Detectives went through the 11-bedroom mansion, videotaping
every room to make an inventory of Scholl's possessions. Outside,
tents still stood on the grounds from a fund-raiser Scholl
reportedly held Sunday for a local hospital.
   Scholl was an accomplished tenor and most of his society
contacts involved music. He performed in May at the annual
``champagne and strings'' benefit for the Academy of Children's
Music in Fort Washington, Pa.
   The grand larceny complaint alleged the three men used the money
they took from the premiums to buy ``homes, securities,
automobiles, paintings, rare books, antiques and other items.''
   Hatch's attorney, Glen A. Zeitz, described the case in court as
a dispute over commissions. The two defendants, led into the
courtroom in handcuffs, wouldn't speak with reporters.
   According to the district attorney's statement, several
companies sought insurance through Minet International, which is
based in Montreal and the United Kingdom.
   Minet put together a group of insurance underwriters, including
American International Underwriters, where Scholl worked from 1986
to 1988, and Transatlantic Reinsurance Co., where DiTrapani worked.
   Scholl and DiTrapani allegedly instructed Minet to pay premiums
to an intermediary, the International Reinsurance Brokerage
Operation, which was controlled by Hatch.
   Scholl and DiTrapani wrote policies for the coverage but never
filed them with their companies, according to Morgenthau. Instead,
they split up the premiums with Hatch.
   Scholl and Hatch were arraigned Wednesday before Judge Benjamin
Crahalla in Lower Providence Township. Each was ordered held in
Montgomery County Prison in lieu of $5 million bail on a fugitive
from justice charge.

<TEXT>
   Only four states in the nation do not have
grass-roots organizations opposed to smoking, and three of those
states are linked to the nasty habit through the tobacco industry,
the government reported Thursday.
   Hawaii, Kentucky, Mississippi and South Carolina are the only
states without such anti-smoking groups, said the report by the
federal Centers for Disease Control.
   Kentucky and South Carolina are leading tobacco producers, noted
Tom Novotny of the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health. Mississippi
also grows a small amount of tobacco.
   The CDC's annual Behavioral Risk Factor Survey earlier this
month showed Kentucky to be the state with the highest number of
smokers. Thirty-four percent of the adult respondents to the study
in Kentucky said they were smokers.
   ``The tobacco issue is something else in Kentucky,'' said
Phyllis Skonicki, manager of the Health Promotion Branch for the
Kentucky Department of Health Services. ``We're one of the largest
growing states in the nation. ... From the smallest farm to the
largest, you're going to find some tobacco.''
   In the United States, 29 percent of the adults age 18 and older
smoke, according to the CDC's latest statistics.
   The anti-smoking coalitions are made up of community volunteers,
sometimes aided by public health workers. Their growing number
represents ``an increasing level of concern in the government and
among people not strictly in the health field,'' said Novotny, who
prepared the report.
   ``It just shows a strong sort of grassroots, institutionalized
effort to take on the problem of tobacco use,'' he said. ``There's
been a general shift in the social attitude. Smoking no longer is
seen as socially acceptable. It's continually identified as the
major cause of preventable death in this country.''
   A total of 390,000 people in the United States died from
smoking-related illnesses in 1985, the last year for which
statistics are available, Novotny said. ``It will undoubtedly be
more than that when the figures are updated. We know lung cancer
has increased since then.''
   Restrictions on smoking in public places have grown with concern
about the health hazards involved with smoking, he said.
   Colorado established the first grass-roots anti-smoking
coalition in 1963, the CDC said. Most of the other states formed
coalitions after 1984.

<HEAD>Study Sees Shortage Of `Gold Collar' Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most American employers are worried about a
shortage of skilled workers, but few have made job training for new
employees a priority, according to a study delivered to Congress
Thursday.
   A majority of 645 employers who were surveyed said they thought
there was already a labor shortage in America or one on the way,
according to a study called ``Workforce 2000, ``Competing in a
Sellers Market: Is Corporate America Prepared?''
   Employers are specifically concerned about a potential shortfall
of so-called ``knowledge workers'' who are professionals or have
technical skills, said the study, conducted by Towers Perrin, a
management consultant firm.
   Those ``knowledge'' workers are also sometimes called ``gold
collar'' employees because demand for them is expected to be so
great that they will be able to name their own salaries and the
conditions of their employment, the study said. Those workers
include people in such fields as electronics, computers and
communications who have technical skills.
   ``Whether or not knowledge workers will have such bargaining
power, our survey companies are clearly worried about hiring these
important employees, especially over the next five years,'' the
study said.
   However, the study said most companies are still using
traditional solutions for recruitment or helping employees learn
and improve skills, rather than trying novel approaches.
   For instance, 78 percent of the firms use the traditional
process of reimbursing employees for the costs of tuition, while
just 8 percent have their own remedial training program, the study
said.
   The most common reason for rejecting potential job candidates
was inadequate writing or verbal skills, the study said, but few
firms had made training a priority.
   Two-thirds of the firms surveyed spent less than $2,000 a year
on training for entry-level hires and many companies spend nothing
at all, the study said.
   About half of the survey respondents reported hiring more than
150 entry-level workers a year. Of those new hires, about 28
percent end up quitting or being fired within their first year,
usually because of an unacceptable job performance, the study said.
   ``The high cost of turnover notwithstanding, most companies do
not appear to be devoting significant financial resources to
training,'' said the study.
   About 5 percent of the employers spent more than $5,000 annually
in classroom and on-the-job training for new employees in their
first year.
   The study was delivered at a Senate Labor task force hearing on
the workforce and workplace readiness.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., who chairs the task force, said
the study ``reveals that most companies run their businesses like
we were still in the 1950s.''

<HEAD>Italian Man Comes Out of Coma After Nearly Three Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CICAGNA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Uttering ``mama,'' a 25-year-old man came
out of a nearly three-year-long coma and is now moving his limbs
and speaking, Italian media reported Thursday.
   The man, Marcello Manunza, came out of the coma on Monday in a
hospital near Genoa, responding to tickling and encouragement from
his family, the reports said.
   ``For a few days we had realized that my son seemed to respond
to external stimuli,'' his mother Giuseppina told the Italian news
agency ANSA on Thursday.
   ``He followed my movements with his eyes, he seemed to recognize
my voice. He stared for a long time at signs we had hung near his
bed, where we all had written brief phrases of encouragement. You
could see he was trying to force his eyes to read, even to the
point of their reddening.''
   The man had undergone special physiotherapy under the direction
of a Philadelphia professor, Glen Doman, the reports said.
   The man had been placed on a board at a 45-degree angle to help
him move, and had been given frequent massages, the reports said.
   Manunza, who went into a coma after a November 1987 car
accident, can now eat and understand what is said to him, according
to the reports.

<TEXT>
   Felix Bloch, target of a U.S. spy
investigation, wants to quit the Foreign Service, but the State
Department is trying to decide whether to fire him instead, a
spokesman said Thursday.
   Bloch, 55, lost his job in the European Affairs bureau in
February and his $80,000-a-year pay stopped with his suspension. In
the meantime, the Justice Department looked into suspicions Bloch
gave sensitive information to the Soviet Union and had been paid by
Moscow.
   However, law enforcement sources have said the FBI was unable to
prove that Bloch passed along specific classified information,
which is necessary to prove espionage. A grand jury, meanwhile, had
examined his finances in an attempt to trace any Soviet payments.
   If Bloch is fired, he will be branded a violator of U.S.
national security.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher, confirming an account in The
Washington Times, said Bloch submitted his resignation on July 5
and also withdrew a request for a hearing on the State Department's
attempt to fire him.
   ``The department has informed Mr. Bloch that it will continue
with the proceedings initiated last February to remove him from the
Foreign Service for national security reasons,'' Boucher said.
``The department will take no action on Mr. Bloch's tendered
resignation pending the outcome of these proceedings.''
   lthough Bloch was the subject of FBI surveillance for months, he
was never arrested or charged with a crime. As a senior Foreign
Service officer he would be eligible on retirement to receive up to
70 percent of his salary, or about $56,000 a year.
   Bloch had served in East Germany and Austria beginning in the
early 1970s. His most recent assignment dealt with economic policy
in the European Affairs bureau in Washington.
   The State Department had prepared evidence and witnesses for a
hearing scheduled for July 9 at Bloch's request.
   Now that his lawyers have withdrawn the request, the next step
is for Secretary of State James A. Baker III to review the record
against Bloch and decide whether to fire him on security grounds,
Boucher said.
   There will be no action on the retirement request in the
meantime, the spokesman said. It was no clear whether Bloch would
lose his pension if he is fired.

<HEAD>Barry Prosecutors Accuse Leadoff Defense Witness of Using Drugs</HEAD>

   Prosecutors accused one of Marion Barry's
security guards of using cocaine Thursday, interrupting the guard's
testimony as the leadoff defense witness in the mayor's drug and
perjury trial.
   Prosecutors also suggested that the guard, Washington police
officer James Stays, had told another policeman the name of a Barry
drug supplier.
   Stays denied he had made such a statement, then the jury was
sent out of the room before prosecutors made the drug-use
allegation in remarks to U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson.
   Jackson, rejecting defense objections, ruled that Stays could be
questioned about using cocaine but suspended proceedings to allow
him to consult with a lawyer.
   After a lunch recess, Stays twice denied using drugs when
Retchin asked about the subject. On further questioning from Barry
attorney Robert Mance, Stays also denied talking to the other
officer about a drug supplier.
   Outside the courtroom, Barry accused the prosecution of
``satanic dirt-like tactics.''
   The surprise developments came as Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith
Retchin began cross-examining Stays, a member of the elite
24-member security detail that accompanies Barry to all his public
and private functions. All members are police officers.
   The jury heard only this exchange on the subject:
   Retchin: ``Did you tell Detective Goodwine (another security
officer) that Willie Davis supplied Mr. Barry with cocaine?''
   Stays: ``Me? No.''
   After jurors were sent out of the courtroom, Retchin told the
judge, ``The government has evidence that this witness has used
cocaine.''
   The issue came up after Stays testified he knew Willie Davis, a
man whom government witnesses have testified used cocaine with
Barry.
   Davis, a former aide to Birmingham, Ala., Mayor Richard
Arrington, has not been called to testify in the case.
   After a 30-minute recess, Jackson ruled, over the protests of
Barry attorney R. Kenneth Mundy, that Retchin could pursue her line
of questioning.
   ``I deem Miss Retchin's cross-examination of Mr. Stays to be
related to the credibility of the witness,'' Jackson said. ``The
defense has asked prosecution witnesses, at great length, about
their prior drug use.''
   Mundy argued that Stays had no knowledge of Barry drug use and
had not told other security officers the name of anyone supplying
drugs to the mayor.
   Stays at one point had demanded to take a urinalysis test to
determine whether he used drugs when asked about it by other police
detectives working on Barry's case, the mayor's attorney said.
   ``He is anxious to come in here and answer ... and lay any
rumors to rest,'' Mundy said.
   ``Officers from the Internal Affairs Division have informed me
he (Stays) was not willing to take a urinalysis,'' Retchin
retorted. ``There has been testimony under oath before the grand
jury of Mr. Stays' own drug use.''
   When she resumed her questioning of Stays, Retchin asked whether
he had used drugs at a private home in Kettering, Md., or in a
suite at a Washington hotel where Barry and others were present.
Stays answered no to each query. Defense lawyer Mance said outside
court that Barry had told him he had never used drugs with any
defense witnesses.
   Later, officer Warren Goodwine, a former member of Barry's
security force, said under cross-examination that he told police
investigators he ``tried to stay out of Mr. Barry's activities as
much as possible.''
   Under further questioning from Mance, Goodwine said he had not
meant to suggest he suspected that the mayor used drugs.
   ``If I said that ... I felt the mayor was entitled to some
privacy,'' Goodwine testified.
   He was not asked about the question concerning what Stays might
have told him about a Barry drug supplier.
   Earlier Thursday, Stays had contradicted minor points in the
testimony of a key government witness.
   Stays, a 29-year police veteran, said that he never babysat the
children of Rasheeda Moore and never delivered money to her.
   Moore, the government's star witness, had testified that Stays
looked after her children on one occasion while she and the mayor
used drugs. She also told the court that Stays had delivered to her
a package from the mayor that contained money for drugs.
   Before the defense began making its case Thursday, Jackson
denied motions to acquit Barry of four of the 14 charges against
him. On Wednesday, he rejected a similar effort with regard to the
other 10 counts the mayor faces.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy count, and
three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged
drug use.

<HEAD>Experts Recommend Against Approving AIDS Home Test Kit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of experts recommended the Food and
Drug Administration turn down an application to market the nation's
first home blood-collection kit for AIDS antibody testing.
   The FDA's Blood Products Advisory Committee on Wednesday voted
3-1 against approval of the proposal by University Hospital
Laboratories Corp. of Bethesda, Md.
   With the company's test kit, an individual would use a lancet to
draw a small sample of blood, which would be collected on special
filter paper, and send the sample anonymously to a laboratory where
it would be tested. The individual would receive the results by
telephone.
   Panel members echoed the FDA's concerns about the safety of
people drawing their own blood and the validity of tests obtained
through this system, said Dr. Jay S. Epstein, chief of the
retrovirology laboratory in FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research.
   The experts also were concerned about the adequacy of telephone
counseling for individuals who test positive for antibodies to the
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, he said.
   The FDA is also concerned whether anonymous AIDS-related testing
is in the public interest, since public health workers would be
unable to follow up on counseling for individuals who tested
positive.
   Epstein said on Thursday the FDA would complete its review of
University Hospital Laboratories' application by Aug. 8.
   The FDA began accepting applications for AIDS home test kits
last spring after officials said they would reconsider their
opposition to home blood-collection kits for AIDS-related testing.
   University Hospital Laboratories' application was the first
received, Epstein said, but he could not say how many others, if
any, have been received since then.
   At the time, Dr. Paul Parkman, director of the Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research, said officials were persuaded to
rethink their opposition because of medical advances in treatment
that could slow progression of the disease in its early stages.
   Other considerations included technical advances that, for
example, have shown accurate test results could be obtained using a
blood sample prepared and transported on a filter paper.
   University Hospital Laboratories had filed a lawsuit seeking to
force the FDA to accept its application, which had been filed in
December 1987.
   The lawsuit was settled April 10, but FDA officials said the
lawsuit had no effect on its decision to begin accepting
applications.
   Epstein said the advisory committee's recommendation affected
only University Health Laboratories' application.

   Federal regulators Thursday defended their
first surprise inspections of 30 radio and television stations to
check compliance with political advertising and equal opportunity
rules.
   The Federal Communications Commission inspections, carried out
Monday and Tuesday in five cities, kicked off an auditing process
that is expected to be completed before the fall congressional
elections.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said Thursday the inspections were
necessary in light of reductions in permanent FCC monitoring
stations and did not reflect a belief that violations of political
programming rules w
   Sikes, in a meeting with reporters, said the audits will
determine how well stations are complying and ``lead to more
voluntary compliance.''
   The inspections were carried out in Cincinnati; Dallasere widespread.-Fort
Worth; Philadelphia; Portland, Ore., and San Francisco. The FCC
said the stations were chosen because of their diverse locations
and because they serve large areas.
   Milton Gross, chief of the FCC's political branch, acknowledged
that this was the first such FCC audit of broadcasters.
   ``Heretofore, we generally operated on a complaint basis,''
Gross said in an interview.
   The commission in April fined an Indianapolis television
station, WXIN, $10,000 fy belligerent
Iraq, a Kuwaiti source said. This was seen as an indication that
the crisis was resolved.

<TEXT>
   Wealthy Americans and Texans would bear a
greater burden of the savings and loan bailout under separate bills
filed in Congress Thursday.
   Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass., backed by consumer advocate
Ralph Nader, argued that wealthy investors used federal protection
for up to $100,000 in deposits to reap substantial interest income.
Now that scores of S&amp;Ls have gone under, poor and middle class
taxpayers are unfairly being asked to pay, he said.
   Kennedy proposed legislation that would raise $100 billion in
bailout costs over five years by imposing three new taxes: a 7.5
percent surtax on interest, dividends and capital gains for
individuals reporting income more than $100,000 per year; a 5
percent surtax on corporations earning more than $75,000 per year;
and elimination of an inheritance tax provision that forgives taxes
on appreciated capital gains at death.
   ``The bailout represents nothing less than the single largest
transfer of wealth from the working class to the wealthy in the
history of America,'' Kennedy said at a Capitol Hill news
conference. ``The working people of America must not be made to pay
for a party that they were not invited to.''
   The Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition proposed
legislation that would shift the burden of the bailout
geographically rather than based on income. The coalition bill
would remove federal deposit insurance benefits from
state-regulated S&amp;Ls or require state taxpayers to bear a heftier
share of the bailout.
   In some instances, backers say, deregulation at the state level
led to lending and investment abuses at S&amp;Ls. If states caused the
problem, the coalition argues, federal taxpayers shouldn't be
forced to pay all of the bailout.
   As it currently stands, the bill would only affect Texas,
according to Keith Laughlin, who drafted the bill. Of the $57
billion in bailout costs to date, $20.9 billion is attributable to
state-chartered banks in Texas. If all the S&amp;Ls in question seek to
retain federal deposit insurance, the state would pay an extra $2.8
billion toward the bailout.

   New fighting between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks in
Soviet Central Asia has increased the death toll to 212, and
incidents of ``sadistic cruelty'' have taken place, state media
reported Thursday.
   The newspaper Rabochaya Tribuna said about 1,200 people have
been hospitalized from violence since early June.
   On Wednesday, 204 people had been reported killed in the
fighting, which broke out June 4 in western Kirghizia in a land
dispute between the ethnic groups, both largely Sunni Moslems who
speak Turkish dialects.
   Tass said Thursday, ``Reports are still coming in of fights,
arson and pogroms. Passing cars are being stoned. Barricades are
being built.''
   Tensions had eased during 40 days of mourning for those killed
in the June fighting, but violence flared again this week when that
period ended.
   Most of the fighting has raged in Osh. This week's violence shut
down industrial enterprises and snarled public transport, Interfax
news service said. In nearby Uzgen, which is predominantly Uzbek,
residents demand that Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov go to the
region, it said.
   Soviet authorities bolstered security troops in the region by
sending Col. Gen. Yuri Shatalin, commander of Interior Ministry
troops, there, Tass said.
   The unrest has caused an estimated $68 million in damage and
left more than 400 people missing and possibly dead, Rabochaya
Tribuna said. Earlier, Soviet media had reported 800 people were
missing in the area.
   The newspaper said security police have been informed of 65 to
80 burials that have yet to be investigated. It said there have
been cases of ``sadistic cruelty,'' but gave no specifics.
   Of the 212 dead, at least 132 are Uzbeks and 47 are Kirghiz, the
paper said. It did not give the nationalities of the other victims.
   In reporting on causes of the bloodshed, Rabochaya Tribuna said
unemployment has tripled in the region the past five years,
reaching 47,000 by the time violence broke out.
   Many of the jobless are youths who no longer want to live in
rural areas and have flooded cities and towns looking for housing,
it said.
   The newspaper also blamed the unrest on calls among ethnic
groups that the indigenous population should prevail in urban
areas. It said the Osh border region is made up of 60
nationalities. About 60 percent of the population of the region is
Kirghiz and 25 percent is Uzbek, the newspaper added.
   Although Uzbeks make up nearly half the population of Osh, no
Uzbeks are among its municipal and Communist Party leaders, the
newspaper said.

   A new Lithuanian law conscripting young men into
the service of the secessionist republic rather than the national
army further clouds an already gloomy draft outlook for the Soviet
armed forces.
   The Lithuanian law, passed Wednesday, does not create a separate
army. It requires instead a year of mandatory civic service or
military training for men aged 19 to 26, said Simas Ardziunas, a
representative of the parliament's information bureau.
   Results of the annual spring draft for the Soviet armed forces
read like a barometer of regional dissent. About half or fewer
conscripts reported for duty in the secessionist Baltic republics
and the troubled southern republics of Georgia and Armenia had even
lower rates.
   Only 33.6 percent of draft-age Lithuanian men reported as
required this year for the Red Army, compared to 91.6 percent last
year, the Soviet army newspaper Red Star reported last week.
   The rates in Latvia were 90.7 percent last year and 54.2 percent
this year, and Estonia, 79.5 percent last year and 40.2 percent
this year.
   The worst rate was in Armenia, 7.5 percent, influenced by a law
passed by the republic requiring young men to remain there to
continue repair work from the December 1988 earthquake.
   Red Star quoted Lt. Gen. N. Ter-Grigoryants as complaining about
laws passed by republics restricting military service outside their
borders.
   He said 6,500 young men did not report for service last year.
Numbers for this year are not yet known, he said.
   The article did not disclose the total number of draftees. An
armed forces spokesman said all inquiries should be directed by
letter through the Ministry of Foreign Affars.
   The Soviet armed forces contain about 5.1 million people,
according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in
London.
   The Kremlin had no immediate reaction to the new Lithuanian law,
passed by the republic's Supreme Council parliament on a 68-16
vote, with 22 abstentions.
   Ardziunas said the legislation would not go into effect until
the government issues a directive on details of service. No
barracks or camps yet exist for the force, and the law ``says
nothing about any weapons,'' he said.
   Youths in the force would be available for border service and in
case of natural disasters, he said.
   Thousands of Soviet troops remain in Lithuania, although the
republic declared its independence from the Soviet Union on March
11. Lithuania then became embroiled in a dispute with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, and he imposed an economic embargo to force it into line.
   On June 29, the Lithuanian Supreme Council approved a moratorium
on the declaration, to take effect when talks with Soviet officials
begin on independence. Soviet officials immediately began lifting
the embargo.

<HEAD>New Allegations in Lawsuit Against Montana GOP, National
Republican Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB ANEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former executive director of the
Montana Republican Party has accused the organization, its
chairwoman and a national GOP committee of breaking federal
racketeering laws.
   The allegations involved the handling of political money during
the 1988 campaigns.
   Terry Merica made the allegations in a complaint filed in U.S.
District Court on Wednesday. It amends a lawsuit he and his wife,
Neida, filed in December.
   The complaint alleges that the state GOP, Chairwoman Barbara
Campbell and the National Republican Senatorial Committee committed
wire and mail fraud by illegally funneling money into the campaigns
of Sen. Conrad Burns and Gov. Stan Stephens.
   Burns, at the time a county commissioner in Billings, upset
Democratic incumbent Sen. John Melcher in the November election.
Stephens defeated former Democratic Gov. Tom Judge in the race for
governor.
   The complaint says the defendants used a series of letters and
money transfers in the spring and summer of 1988 to defraud the
citizens of Montana and the United States.
   The original lawsuit alleged the Mericas were fired in late 1988
for questioning whether financial dealings between the state
Republican Party and the national committee violated state and
federal election laws.
   Neida Merica was an administrative secretary for the state GOP.
   Wednesday's complaint contends there were additional violations
of the federal Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act.
   Charles Erdmann, attorney for the Montana GOP, said the new
contentions may reflect Merica's concern that the original suit
will be dismissed.
   ``This may be nothing more than an attempt to bolster their
complaint,'' he said.
   He would not comment on specifics, saying he had not seen the
new complaint, but he questioned the timing of its filing. The
state GOP convention began Thursday in Billings, with President
Bush scheduled to appear in the evening on behalf of Lt. Gov. Allen
Kolstad, who is challenging Democratic incumbent Sen. Max Baucus.
   ``The timing of this would make you think this is politically
motivated,'' Campbell said Thursday.
   James Goetz, the Mericas' attorney, said the timing was
coincidence.
   The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helps
organize campaigns of GOP Senate candidates, had no immediate
comment on the new allegations.
   The complaint alleges the defendants committed mail and wire
fraud by not legally reporting as much as $200,000 in campaign
contributions in 1988.
   It cites several instances of questionable handling of campaign
financing. It alleges that:
   _The national committee conducted a voter identification project
in Montana, but gave results only to the Burns and Stephens
campaigns. The cost of the project was never reported as a
contribution to the campaigns and the expense exceeded the federal
limit on what such committees can give to a candidate.
   _The national committee transferred thousands of dollars through
the Montana GOP's accounts to help pay for a direct mailing by a
Texas company for the Burns campaign in violation of federal
election laws.
   _Between Aug. 8, 1988, and Nov. 16, 1988, the national committee
shifted $178,145 into the Montana GOP's account. The money
transfers prompted a Nov. 8 memo from Ward Shanahan, the state
party's lawyer, to GOP headquarters warning that the national
committee was using the Montana Republican Party for ``financial
shenanigans.''
   _In October 1988, the Republican Governors' Association gave
$8,000 to the Montana GOP with a letter from Executive Director
Michele Davis saying the money should be reported as coming from
the Republican National Committee.

   A measles epidemic in Washington state was spread
in large part by unvaccinated immigrants who brought the virus from
Mexico, federal health officials said Thursday.
   At least 26 percent of the 266 measles cases reported in
Washington state so far this year were acquired in Mexico or were
linked to cases acquired there, the Centers for Disease Control
said in its weekly report.
   Last year, 15 percent of all cases reported in the state were
linked to Mexico, it said. Nationwide, 3 percent of the 17,850
measles cases reported last year were acquired outside the United
States, it said.
   Across the country, measles continue to be spread in medical
settings, especially hospital emergency rooms, because cases often
are not diagnosed and isolated promptly and because many medical
workers are not immune, the CDC said.
   In the first 26 weeks of 1990, nearly five times more cases were
diagnosed in Washington than during all of 1989, when 55 measles
cases were reported, state health officials said. The outbreak is
the largest since 1979.
   Nearly half of the cases occurred among unvaccinated people, the
CDC said.
   Of those unvaccinated, more than half were Hispanics, who
account for 4 percent of the state's population of 4.5 million and
are its largest ethnic minority. The state's Hispanic population
increased by about 39 percent from 1980 to 1988, the CDC said.
   Detailed data available for 218 of the 266 cases showed that 97
of them were Hispanics, the CDC said. Of those 97 cases, Mexican
citizens working in Washington accounted for 72 percent and
Hispanic U.S. citizens made up 28 percent.
   The state Department of Health spent $1.1 million for 76,000
doses of measles vaccine this spring, said Barbara Baker,
Washington's immunization director.
   Vaccination clinics were publicized in Spanish and English on
radio and television, in newspapers and by sound trucks in Hispanic
neighborhoods, she said.

   Singing in sauna-like conditions, the
Leningrad Boys' Choir made its American debut Thursday, at the
Capitol Children's Museum.
   The young men, dressed in heavy black suits and bow ties, sang
Soviet folk songs, classics and sacred songs for an audience of
about 150 people. The singers also were introduced to Washington's
muggy summer weather, performing in 90-degree heat in a room
without air conditioning.
   ``In Leningrad it is much cooler,'' 12-year-old Eugene Meehaiev
said through a translator. ``But it really doesn't matter because I
put all my feelings in to my song. That's all I think about.''
   Audience members enthusiastically applauded each selection _
especially after young soloists, nudged on by conductor Vladimir
Stolpovsky, took their bows.
   The choir's trip to the United States is sponsored by the
Greater Philadelphia-Leningrad Partnership, said Eric Schippers,
public liaison at the United States Information Agency.
Philadelphia had sent a boys' choir to Leningrad and the two choirs
will sing together for the first time in Philadelphia.
   ``If there are two things that'll unite the world, it's young
people and music,'' said museum director Anne Lewin.
   The 37 choir members, ranging from ages eight to 17, arrived in
the United States on Tuesday, said museum spokeswoman Mary Abbajay.
   The youths attended a cookout and swimming party at the home of
Esther Coopersmith, a trustee of the Children's Museum. In addition
to seeing other Washington sights, the group toured the White House
Thursday and gave an impromptu performance afterward, Schippers
said.
   ``They were so excited they burst into song on the White House
lawn,'' Mrs. Coopersmith said.
   Choir member Eugene Vishnevsky, who doesn't know much English
besides ``How do you do?'' said of the United States: ``The people
here are very kind and very hospitable.''
   ``I'd like very much to meet more American children,'' the
12-year-old said through a translator.
   Another choir member said the best thing about the United States
is ``the sun-shining people.''
   ``The people are more happy,'' Nicolay Kruglov, 17, said. ``It's
more free here, I think.''
   The choir, the oldest musical establishment in the Soviet Union,
was founded in 1479 by Ivan III, and began touring across the
Soviet Union and Europe in the 1930s. The boys attend Leningrad's
M.I. Glinka Choir School.

<HEAD>US Says Salvadoran Left Should End Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department accused leftist rebels in
El Salvador on Thursday of engaging in a campaign of violence and
said they should change tactics in the interests of reaching a
peace settlement.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the insurgents have
carried out a series of ``brutal assassinations'' directed at
Salvadoran military personnel and their families.
   ``The purpose of this violence seems to be to polarize the
situation further and to elicit a reaction from extremists on the
right,'' Boucher said.
   As examples, Boucher cited the recent murders of a Salvadoran
off-duty officer and of an Army major who was on his way to law
school.
   He said the rebels also are preparing for a military offensive.
He added that ongoing peace talks with the government can only
succeed if both parties negotiate seriously and honestly.
   With talks set to resume Friday in Costa Rica, Boucher said the
insurgents ``should put aside its tractics of assassination and
violence and go to the table committed to a just peace.''

   Richard Nixon, a political outcast no
more, basked Thursday in the praise of three other men who held
America's highest office during a ceremony where the word Watergate
was mentioned only once.
   That mention, almost in passing, came from George Bush.
   The president, and former presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald
Reagan, along with their wives, joined to give the new Nixon
Library and Birthplace a festive send-off. It was an occasion as
red, white and blue as the thousands of balloons that were released
at the end of the 2{-hour ceremony.
   Never before have four presidents of the United States shared
the same speaking platform, although Nixon, Ford and Jimmy Carter
were together at a reception given in the White House by Reagan
before the three flew to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's funeral
in 1981.
   Bush said that visitors for years to come will learn of Nixon's
six crises _ the title of his first book _ ``and the seventh
crisis, Watergate.''
   None of the other speakers mentioned the scandal that drove
Nixon from office in 1974.
   For Nixon, it was a major milestone in his relentless drive for
acceptance. The man who was elected with the most votes in history
had been shunned by fellow Republicans at their national
conventions and only in recent years has been invited to their
functions.
   ``This is a very special day for all of us,'' he told a crowd of
more than 10,000. ``Nothing we have ever seen matches this moment,
to be welcomed so warmly.''
   Bush led the tributes to the 37th president.
   ``To occupy this office is to feel a kinship with these and
other presidents,'' he said. ``Each of whom, in his own way, sought
to do right and thus achieve good. ... Each wondered, I suspect,
how they could be worthy of God, and man.''
   Bush, who as chairman of the Republican Party in 1974 urged
Nixon to resign, urged visitors to the $21 million library to
``look at Richard Nixon the man.''
   Nixon, said Bush, ``was the quintessence of Middle America'' who
touched a cord with millions of citizens.
   ``He loved America's good, quiet, decent people; he spoke for
them; he felt, deeply, on their behalf.''
   Ford, who served out Nixon's term, began his speech with ``Mr.
President, Mr. President, Mr. President. If I overlooked a
president, will he please stand up.''
   He told Nixon, ``This day is a celebration richly deserved by
you and by Pat.''
   Reagan said, ``the world is a better place, a safer place,
because of Richard Nixon.''
   The library, adjacent to the 900-foot-square house where Nixon
was born 77 years ago, tells the story of Nixon's life, from his
boyhood through the political offices he held _ congressman,
senator, vice president and president. The exhibits also include a
treatment of Watergate, the scandal that was Nixon's undoing.
   The audience in 90-degree heat outdoors was said by library
spokesman Fred Gorell to number 40,000. Police, however, estimated
the crowd at 10,000-plus.
   Most of the crowd was on the suburban streets surrounding the
spacious library grounds 25 miles southeast of downtown Los
Angeles. Within the building, there were 2,400 seats for invited
visitors and bleacher space for 1,400.
   Many stalwarts from the Nixon administration showed up. Former
Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and William Rogers were in the
audience, as was Alexander Haig, Nixon's chief of staff in the
final year, and William Simon, Nixon's secretary of the treasury.
   Some protesters showed up and two were ejected. Outside on Yorba
Linda Boulevard, people waved signs saying ``He's still Tricky
Dick,'' and ``Richard Repent.''
   Evangelist Billy Graham, an old Nixon friend and frequent guest
in the Nixon White House, spoke in his opening prayer of ``the
upheavals and uncertainties through which the world passed'' during
the Nixon era.
   Simon, chairman of the foundation that built the library with
$21 million in private funds, also touched on the controversies
that surrounded Nixon throughout his 25-year political career.
   ``Despite all of that, as well as the unrelenting hostility from
the national media, President Nixon managed to lead America out of
the Vietnam War and bring back our POWs.''
   Before the ceremony, in the cool of the library, Nixon was asked
how he felt.
   ``I feel as good as the rest of them look,'' Nixon said pointing
to his fellow presidents.
   Nixon toured the library Wednesday for the first time and was
asked how he liked it.
   ``What I've seen of it, I've been impressed but I'm not the best
judge,'' he conceded. ``I'm going to let these three be the judge
and jury. I'm glad to be in the hands of this jury.''
   Ford already has a library, in Michigan; Reagan will open his in
Simi Valley, 60 miles to the northwest of Nixon's, next February
and plans already are under way for one to house Bush's papers and
artifacts.
   Nixon's library is more of a museum since it houses none of
Nixon's papers. Next year, if plans are followed, the library will
get Nixon's archives from his congressional and vice presidential
days and those that followed his presidency. But the real
presidential papers, 42 million pages of documents, are in a
warehouse in Alexandria, Va.
   The Nixon papers were seized by Congress after he left office to
prevent him from destroying any Watergate documents.
   Millions of pages have been opened for perusal by scholars and
the library will play tapes of 33 conversations that Nixon recorded
secretly. But nearly 4,000 hours more of tapes as well as 15,000
important documents have been withheld from the public through
actions by Nixon's lawyers.
   At Thursday's ceremony, the wives of the four presidents shared
the stage. Pat Nixon, who has been nearly a recluse for 16 years,
got the loudest applause.
   Reagan, characteristically, had a quip about the man who was
being honored.
   ``Much has been written and said about Richard Nixon,'' said
Reagan. ``Some of it has even been true. ... It will come as no
surprise to anyone here that there will always be a good deal of
debate about Richard Nixon.''

<HEAD>FCC Says Foreign Phone Companies Charging Too Much</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 1-3 to RECAST and CORRECT that excessive charges
are for outgoing, sted incoming calls</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Federal telephone regulators are warning
foreign phone companies that if they don't stop padding charges for
international calls, the United States will take unilateral action
to lower prices.
   The Federal Communications Commission says U.S. phone customers
may have paid as much as $1 billion too much for international
calls in 1988 due to outmoded contracts that allow overseas phone
companies to charge inflated prices for handling the other end of
international calls.
   Not only does the practice hurt individual pocketbooks, it adds
greatly to the U.S. trade deficit because far more calls go out of
the United States than come in.
   U.S. phone companies paid out $2 billion more in 1988 than they
took in from foreign phone companies, according to the FCC, which
last Thursday threatened to limit what American phone companies can
pay to overseas carriers.
   The FCC says roughly half of the $2 billion deficit represented
an overpayment by U.S. consumers to foreign telephone companies
that have refused to keep prices in line with cost-reducing
advances in technology, such as direct dialing.
   The FCC proposed to ease restrictions on how American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph and other U.S. long-distance companies such as MCI and
US Sprint negotiate ``accounting rates'' with foreign companies.
These accounting rates determine how the two sides divvy up the
charges consumers pay for international calls.
   Competition gives U.S. companies an incentive to lower prices,
but foreign phone companies, which typically are state owned, don't
face competitive pressures.
   Their accounting rates may be based on the cost of
operator-assisted international calling, and not reflect the lower
costs of today's ubiquitous direct-dialing.
   West Germany, for instance, has not lowered its accounting rate
since 1983. U.S. phone companies still pay half of $1.56 a minute,
or 78 cents a minute, to the Germans for completing calls to West
Germany.
   AT&amp;T and its rivals charge between $6.20 and $11.58 for a
10-minute call from the United States to West Germany, depending on
when and how the call is made. But a German caller gets hit with a
flat $19.07 for the same call.
   If AT&amp;T charges 62 cents a minute, it loses money. It makes up
such losses, however, by collecting 78 cents a minute for
completing calls from West Germany to the United States.
   But the inflated $1.56 accounting rate keeps prices high _ and
customers foot the bill.
   Foreign governments argue that the U.S. payments represent
much-needed dollars that not only subsidize local phone systems but
also help pay for schools or imported goods.
   Thomas Luciano, deputy director for international settlements at
AT&amp;T, said Wednesday that ``65 percent of the U.S. out payment goes
to developing countries. We recognize we need to be sensitive to
the concerns of some of the foreign telephone companies we're
dealing with.''
   But Luciano argued that if foreign nations lower their rates,
they'll more than make up the lost revenue in increased volume of
calling _ both in and out of their countries. Lower rates also will
boost foreign economic development, he said.
   Luciano said AT&amp;T, which has about 89 percent of the U.S.
overseas phone market, succeeded in lowering international
accounting rates with more than 70 nations in 1989. But he said he
welcomed the FCC's ``impetus.''
   ``We have already been expressing the deep concerns of the U.S.
government, including the FCC, as part of our negotiations,''
Luciano said.
   South Korea, he said, has reduced its accounting rate steadily _
from $2.36 a minute to $2.10 a minute, and Japan dropped its rates
in 1985 from $2.35 to $1.75 a minute. Sweden has cut its accounting
rate in half, he added.

<HEAD>On Anniversary of Presidency, Jaruzelski Hints at Resigning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski, once
Poland's Communist leader and now for many Poles the symbol of that
disgraced regime, marked his first anniversary in office Thursday
by saying he was prepared to resign.
   Jaruzelski, in the rare appearance on national television, said
he would not take a position in the public debate on how long he
should stay in office.
   ``I think it would be better if others made the statements,''
said the former Communist Party leader. He assumed his new office
as president on July 19, 1989.
   ``I don't consider myself anointed, just performing a service
for the nation and for the country,'' said 67-year-old Jaruzelski.
``And the moment recognized as proper for a change of the president
will be treated by me with full understanding.''
   Jaruzelski was elected president for a six-year term last year
during a joint meeting of the new, freely elected Senate and the
partially democratically elected Sejm, or lower house.
   Although the office makes him commander-in-chief of the armed
forces and gives him the power to veto legislation, Jaruzelski uses
his prerogatives sparingly.
   The more powerful position of prime minister is held by Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, a former activist in the Solidarity labor movement.
Solidarity controls the government.
   Even though Jaruzelski was resented for imposing martial law
against Solidarity in 1981, many members of parliament believed he
could help assure smooth relations with the Soviet Union and the
rest of Eastern Europe. Poland's neighbors were still hard-line
Communist as this country pioneered the East bloc's transition to
democracy.
   Many Poles view Jaruzelski as an anachronistic vestige of the
old Communist system now that the Soviet Union has accepted East
bloc changes and Communist rule has ended in neighboring
Czechoslovakia and East Germany.
   Advocates of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa want Walesa installed
as president this fall by parliament.
   Jaruzelski's two longtime loyalists in the Cabinet, Interior
Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak and Defense Minister Gen. Florian
Siwicki, resigned at Mazowiecki's request on July 6.

   Police fired tear gas and guns
in running battles in two townships Thursday with black youths
throwing gasoline bombs and stones, police and witnesses said.
   Three people were reported injured, including one youth police
said was shot in the arm when he tried to throw a firebomb. Police
said 18 people were arrested, and officers continued patrolling the
townships of Vosloorus and Katlehong, east of Johannesburg.
   Houses and businesses of black town council members were gutted
by gasoline bombs thrown by the youths, witnesses and police said.
   Newspaper and radio reports said violence began when students
from a high school in Vosloorus tried to march toward township
council offices to demand the release of two recently arrested
teachers. The charges against the teachers were not available.
   Keith Montsisi, spokesman for the Vosloorus Civic Association,
told the South African Press Association that police fired tear gas
to stop the march, although community leaders assured the officers
the protest would be peaceful. Police spokesmen said the march was
illegal, and tear gas was fired when marchers ignored an order to
disperse.
   Police said the violence spread to nearby Katlehong, where a
house was stoned and burned and a beer delivery truck was attacked.
   In an unrelated case, two white right-wingers were charged in
magistrate's court Thursday with illegal possession of hand
grenades, including the type rolled into a hotel bar Saturday
night. One black man was killed and 27 were injured at the
Roodepoort Hotel. Police are investigating whether one of the
arrested men may be connected with the blast, The Star newspaper
reported.

   Chiquita Brands International is
severing talks with a union whose three-week-old strike has
crippled banana exports to the United States, officials of the
Cincinnati-based company said Thursday.
   Honduras' president, Rafael Leonardo Callejas, said the strike
has caused more than $4.5 million in economic losses to his Central
American country.
   Chiquita, formerly United Fruit, accounts for 60 percent of
Honduran banana exports of 50 million boxes a year. San
Francisco-based Castle &amp; Cooke exports the other 40 percent.
   ``The rigid position of the union has kept talks stalled for the
past two weeks,'' said Chiquita's general manager, Karl F. Koch, in
a prepared statement.
   The 10,000 workers struck June 25 to demand the first increase
in six years in their pay, now averaging $15.32 a day. They want a
58 percent increase.
   ``The last offer by Chiquita Brands was to approve a salary
raise of 14.33 percent, which was immediately rejected by the
union,'' said union president Rene Ayestas. He called the company's
previous offers ``humiliating.''
   For his part, Koch said the company's original optimism ``has
turned to frustration at finding that the union still maintains its
original position.''
   President Callejas earlier sent a presidential mediation team to
try to solve the impasse.
   ``I believe we will reach a negotiated end to the strike this
weekend, although the present situation is tense and difficult,''
the president said.
   The walkout initially was joined by 30,000 other workers in the
health, postal and industrial fields. But those workers returned to
their jobs after 10 days.

   ``Let the children come to me, and do not hinder
them,'' Jesus said, ``for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.''
   That special blessedness of the young taught in Christianity and
the concern for them expressed in sacred writings of other
religions are to be shared next week in a special forum.
   A variety of religious leaders _ Christians, Moslems, Jews,
Hindus, Sikhs, Shintoists, Zoroastrians and others _ are to meet
July 25-27 at Princeton Theological Seminary in New Jersey on
behalf of children around the world.
   ``Religious leaders that do not normally come together about
anything are coming together in the cause of children,'' said
William P. Thompson, chairman of the conference steering committee.
   ``All the major religions have in their traditions a concern for
children,'' he said in an interview. ``Their plight is getting
worse in the world today.''
   Thompson, associate secretary general of the World Conference on
Religion and Peace, which is sponsoring the meeting in cooperation
with the United Nations Children's Fund, added: ``When children are
exploited, we're sowing the seeds of our own destruction.''
   In many ways and places, that's now happening, he said, citing
impoverished conditions in which ``kids are being pushed out to
live on the streets'' and the rising proportion of children among
the world's homeless and refugees.
   Thompson, longtime U.S. Presbyterian leader, said that ``we want
to maximize attention of religion leaders to the problem of
children'' and ``bring that thinking to the forefront'' of public
awareness.
   The three-day meeting, involving 100 religious leaders from 40
countries and representing 10 major religions, is expected to adopt
a ``declaration for children'' and an action program for protecting
their development.
   Being held as a precursor to the ``World Summit for Children''
at the United Nations Sept. 29-30, the interreligious meeting seeks
both to stir concern for children in religious ranks and also
actions by governments.
   ``Defending the rights of children is one of the significant
ways of working for future peace,'' Thompson said, noting that
recent striking changes in Eastern Europe have meant ``great
progress'' in that cause.
   ``But we still have to work at building sufficient justice for
peace to last,'' he said, including more equitable economic
conditions and help for the underprivileged.
   ``There are dauntless problems still before us,'' he said.
   Thompson, 71, chief executive of the United Presbyterian Church
for 18 years and a member of the governing boards of the Nationa
Council of Churches and World Council of Churches, fills his
interreligious peace post without pay.
   ``The sacred writings of all of the great religions commit
themselves to peace,'' he said.
   Some people now and in the past have supported wars in the name
of religion, but the teachings of those faiths themselves
invariably oppose war and advocate peace, he said.
   To blame ``religion as the cause of conflict'' _ which often is
done by anti-religionists _ ``overlooks the facts of the religions
themselves, which in their basic beliefs commit themselves to
peace,'' Thompson said.
   ``Secularists think we're at each throat,'' he added, but he
maintained such judgments were drawn from deviations from religious
principles not adherence to them.
   However, he said, there are extremists in every religion who fan
the flames of conflict, who see no truth in any faith but their own
and who try to maximize their political power to control others.
   In doing so, such a ``person may be hypocritical in not stating
accurately what he knows to be a fact about his religion, or he may
be uninformed about what its religious teachings really are,''
Thompson said.
   In view of ``human motives to seek power and be prideful,'' he
said, ``some use religion as a cloak behind which to hide'' their
real motives, using religious symbols to annimate followers in
conflicts and gain power.
   Asked about regional conflicts such as those between Roman
Catholics and Protestants in Ireland, Moslems and Jews in the
Middle East, Buddhists and Hindus in Sri Lanka or Moslems and
Christians in the Sudan, he said:
   ``These most always are between ethnic groups identified by
their religions. The disputes often are based on ethnic-economic
differences rather than religious motivation as the names suggest.''
   In many cases, he said the conflicts have complex roots in the
past, involving rivalry over power, territories or economic status,
with hostilities extended into the present under religious labels.
   Thompson, a Kansas-reared lawyer who was a U.S. Army captain in
World War II and a war-crimes prosecutor, said war ``is connected
to sin,'' to defections from the principles of all major faiths.
   It happens because of errant human nature, not fidelity to
religions, he said.

<HEAD>Judge Denies Injunction Intervening in Wisconsin Indian Gambling
Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR L. SRB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge who was asked to intervene
in a bitter dispute over Chippewa Indian gambling in Wisconsin has
ruled that tribes that do not have gaming compacts with the state
cannot operate casinos.
   U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb on Wednesday denied a request
from two Chippewa bands seeking an injunction prohibiting the state
from closing down reservation casinos that opened in the last year.
   Mrs. Crabb ruled such casino operations are and will remain
illegal until the tribe and state negotiate and enact federally
required gaming agreements.
   But she also declared that the state, which threatened to
prosecute the tribe, doesn't have authority to close down the
operations. She said that authority rests with the U.S. attorney's
office.
   Jerry Maulson, gaming manager for the Lac du Flambeau Chippewa
band that filed the lawsuit, said the tribe won its argument that
the state doesn't have jurisdiction to prosecute gambling issues on
reservations but lost on the ruling that Indian gambling was
illegal without a gaming compact.
   ``It's sort of like a double-edged sword,'' Maulson said.
   U.S. Attorney Patrick J. Fiedler in Madison said he would
consult with Justice Department officials before deciding whether
to close any reservation casinos in Wisconsin.
   He said previous advice from Washington indicated it was more
``sensible to rely on state prosecutors,'' although it was believed
the state and federal governments had ``concurrent jurisdiction.''
   The year-long dispute in Wisconsin began last fall when the
state and its dozen Indian tribes failed to reaching gambling
regulation pacts by October as required by the U.S. Indian Gambling
Regulatory Act passed by Congress in 1988. The government has since
extended the deadline until next May.
   The negotiations broke off late last year and tensions were
worsened when the state's top law official, Attorney General Donald
Hanaway, issued an advisory opinion in February that casino
gambling was illegal in Wisconsin.
   The opinion led several local prosecutors to warn tribes they
would raid and close down the several reservation casinos that had
begun operations in the last year.
   Most of the tribes closed their reservations voluntarily, but
two bands of Chippewas sued, asking Mrs. Crabb to stop the state
from enforcing state gambling laws on the reservations.
   Mrs. Crabb denied the request, saying the tribes could avoid
prosecution by the government by not sponsoring casino operations
until the required gaming compacts are enacted.
   The ruling came a day after Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
announced guidelines that would allow tribes to buy non-reservation
land to open bingo parlors and other gaming establishments.
   Under the guidelines, such purchases would have to be approved
by the governor of the state, Lujan said.
   The guidelines also bar tribes from buying out-of-state land for
gambling sites. The Interior Department will seek input from tribes
before putting the guidelines in effect.

   A year after they tumbled out of the
smoke-choked fuselage of a shattered jumbo jet into a hot corn
field, survivors of United Flight 232 returned Thursday to give
prayers of thanks and sympathy.
   A memorial service, forced into an airport hangar by heavy
rains, coincided with the moment a year ago when the plane tumbled
in flames while attempting an emergency landing.
   Many cried quietly as the Rev. Gregory Clapper, a United
Methodist minister from Le Mars, led the assembled survivors and
families of victims in part of the 23rd Psalm. Some survivors
described feelings of guilt.
   When Air National Guard jets roared off to form a ``missing
man'' formation, some clasped hands over ears and held clenched
fists to their mouths.
   ``It's been an emotional roller coaster for all of us, but even
so, the remembering has been an important part of the healing
process,'' said United Capt. Al C. Haynes, who led the crew of the
DC-10 in guiding the plane to the airport, where it cartwheeled
while attempting an emergency landing.
   Haynes told the crowd of several hundred it was important for
all involved to deal with the painful memories of the crash.
   ``Somehow, we must find a way to take them away from our present
and make them part of the past,'' Haynes said.
   Many survivors said returning to site of the crash helped them
deal with tragedy.
   ``I wanted my boys to know that Sioux City is a place where
normal things happen, that it's a place of mending as well as
catastrophe,'' said Brownell Bailey of Bowmar, Colo.
   Bailey's wife, Francie, was one of 112 people who died when the
plane crashed after an engine broke apart, severing a hydraulic
system that controlled the plane. There were 296 people aboard the
July 19, 1989, crash.
   Survivors and their families, plus Sioux City rescuers, were
allowed to walk around the crash site Thursday.
   ``I have a lot of memories of some pretty gruesome things, and
we both feel guilty that we walked away unharmed while so many
others didn't,'' said Sharon Bayless, who with her husband, Brad,
of Littleton, Colo., escaped with minor injuries.
   ``I knew it would be hard to come back,'' she said.
   But her husband said a visit to the airport was important.
   ``I want to see it without bodies and luggage and airplane parts
strewn all over,'' he said.
   The Baylesses said one of their first priorities was to thank
the rescuers.
   ``I suppose it's the old Midwest cliche, but there's a lot to be
said about the way the people of Sioux City pitched in to help. I'm
not sure that would have happened if this crash occurred somewhere
else,'' Bayless said.
   Many of the survivors sought out Haynes to thank him for the job
the crew did in guiding the crippled airliner to the airport.
   Despite survivors' thanks and praise, Haynes insisted there were
no heroes in the cockpit. But he said some people needed to look up
to the crew as part of their healing.
   ``If we are serving some kind of function by being called
heroes, so be it,'' Haynes said. ``I'd like to think that any other
well-trained crew would have responded as we did.''
   Roman S. Popielak, a crash survivor also from Littleton, said he
returned ``so I could close the books.''
   ``This is not opening wounds for me. It depends on your strength
or makeup. I prefer to deal with my problems myself. Other people
may need to lean on others and may feel more vulnerable,'' Popielak
said.
   Adriene Badis, 41, of Durham, N.C., his wife and two children
survived the crash, but they were separated for three hours.
   ``I told my older son (Eric, 7) that his brother and mother had
died,'' he said. When he found them alive, ``I was numb, elated,
there are no adjectives.''
   Lori Michaelson used the reunion to put pressure on Congress to
require child restraints on airliners. Currently, small children
are permitted to sit on their parents' laps.
   Ms. Michaelson's 11-month-old daughter, Sabrina _ ripped from
her grasp during the crash _ was saved by another passenger. The
passenger, Jerry Schemmel of Denver, heard her cries and pulled her
from the wreckage.
   ``Let's have something positive come out of this crash,'' she
said.
   ``My actions have been overblown,'' said Schemmel, who appeared
with Ms. Michaelson in one of numerous news conferences at Briar
Cliff College.
   ``You'd be surprised, you'd do the same thing. I didn't run
through a wall of fire to get her. God was looking over us. I
didn't do anything spectacular. I just reacted,'' he said.

   The Sunrunner, a student-built solar car that
runs on ``the power of a hair dryer,'' hummed across the finish
line Thursday to win a Florida-to-Detroit race by 32 sun-powered
vehicles.
   Western Washington University's Viking XX was first to finish,
but the University of Michigan's Sunrunner had the best elapsed
time in the 11-day, 1,641-mile competition: 72 hours, 50 minutes
and 47 seconds. Its average speed was 22.5 mph.
   ``This is about as good as engineering can get,'' said Michigan
team member Bill Kaliardos. ``It's an exciting way to display solar
energy and its applications.''
   The Sunrunner triumphed despite its first mechanical delay, a
10-minute stop Thursday to repair a drive chain.
   Western Washington's entry was second in the early, unofficial
standings, and the University of Maryland's Pride of Maryland came
in third.
   The vehicles completed the final, 84-mile leg of the race under
strong sun and with temperatures in the 80s. The flat, lightweight
vehicles finished with faint whines and hums rather than the
booming exhausts and smoking tires of their internal-combustion
cousins.
   The Sunrunner _ just over 3 feet high but 19 feet long and 6.6
feet wide _ and other cars were designed to expose the maximum area
of solar cells to the sun and run on minimum power, in the
Sunrunner's case 1.5 horsepower.
   ``We're trying to run the car on the power of a hair dryer,''
said Susan Fancy, a 27-year-old mechanical engineering student who
was the Sunrunner's project manager.
   The GM Sunrayce USA, which began July 9 at Disney World in Lake
Buena Vista, Fla., was sponsored by General Motors Corp., the U.S.
Department of Energy and the Society of Automotive Engineers.
   GM plans to send the top three finishers to Australia's World
Solar Challenge, a 2,000-mile race across the Australian outback
from Darwin to Adelaide. It starts Nov. 11.
   ``We're going to take our car back and start preparing it to go
to Australia,'' said Bill Lingenfelter, 23, a Western Washington
University industrial technology student and the Viking XX team
captain.
   Lingenfelter said some 35 people worked for about 18 months on
the Viking XX.
   ``One thing that I really like: it's all student-designed and
student-built,'' said Lingenfelter of the car, which was featured
on the cover of Popular Science last August.
   One of only three two-passenger vehicles in the race, the
pontoon-like vehicle had two fishbowl-shaped cockpits facing each
other. ``It's very radical,'' Lingenfelter said.
   GM held a parade of the finishers and another banquet for the
racers, who were treated to a lobster dinner in Mason on the eve of
the final race day.
   The Star II from small Crowder College in Missouri showed that
small could be beautiful, finishing first in Wednesday's 190-mile
leg from Greenville, Ohio, to Mason.
   Crowder finished fifth overall, edging out such engineering
powerhouses as MIT, in sixth place, and Stanford, in seventh. In
fourth place was the Solar Eagle of California State University-Los
Angeles.

   Bickering prevailed Thursday as White House
officials and congressional leaders spent their first budget
bargaining session in more than a week fighting over recent
partisan statements by both sides.
   ``We simply had to kind of yammer at each other,'' said
negotiator Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.
   The squabbling came as negotiators hit a lull in their efforts
to find enough tax increases and spending cuts to lop $50 billion
off next year's federal deficit.
   Last week, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said
he would demand higher income tax rates for the wealthy if
President Bush continues to seek a capital gains tax reduction.
Democrats argue that the rich would be the main beneficiaries of a
reduction.
   Wednesday, House Republicans voted informally to oppose any
deficit-reduction deal that includes tax increases of any kind.
They also accused Mitchell of hindering the search for a budget
deal.
   On Thursday, Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., blistered Mitchell
and the Democrats again, claiming they ``go to bed at night worried
that there might be something they haven't taxed yet.''
   But House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said
that at Thursday's session, Republican leaders promised to try do
what Democrats have demanded: deliver the votes of at least half of
Congress' GOP lawmakers for whatever budget deal emerges.
   ``They reassured us that provided we reach an agreement, they'll
work to do that,'' Panetta said.
   Participants said no substantive ground was covered as full
negotiating teams from both sides met for the first time since July
11. The 2{-hour session illustrated how politically sensitive a
task the budget bargainers have.
   ``There's a lot of concern that you can't work what are very
difficult issues and have grenades thrown in one direction or the
other,'' said Panetta. ``Hopefully, the summit will get back on
track.''
   The negotiators plan to meet again Monday, and meet with Bush
that evening.

   On March 6, 1944, Col. Hub Zemke sent an
enemy German plane spiraling through the sky in flames, the fate of
its pilot unknown. On Thursday, his former foe reappeared.
   ``There's no need to have a personal war,'' said Wolfgang
Kretschmer, 68, the former first lieutenant Zemke shot down. ``The
war's over with.''
   Zemke, 76, now an almond grower in Oroville, Calif., joked with
Kretschmer and his wife, Elli, before the two former pilots signed
prints of a painting depicting their air battle over Germany.
   They were brought together here by The Greenwich Workshop, Inc.,
an art production company that made the prints. On Friday they will
appear at the workshop's gallery in Southport.
   ``See the holes I put in you?'' said Zemke, pointing to
Kretschmer's plane in the painting. The two men laughed.
   Zemke, in a P-47, shot down Kretschmer during the first American
raid on Berlin. Kretschmer, in an FW 190, flew directly into a
group of 40 American fighter planes with no cover, said Zemke.
   ``I jumped on him and after giving him two blasts, I saw that he
was on fire,'' said Zemke. ``He probably never saw me.''
   Kretschmer, who lives in Haan, West Germany, said he suffered
second- and third-degree burns on the upper half of his body that
burned off part of his nose and left his wrists ``crisp.''
   But he recovered and returned to military service, becoming an
architect after the war.
   Zemke's plane crashed during a thunderstorm seven months later
and he was held prisoner in Germany for five months.
   Both men say they have no regrets.
   After a decade of exchanging letters, the two met for the first
time in April at the Airman Memorial Museum near Washington, where
the painting was first displayed.
   Artist William S. Phillips, 45, of Ashland, Ore., said he has
reunited other former foes to sign prints of their battles.
   ``I've never had a situation where people got together and
weren't friendly and refused to talk,'' he said.

   Five Cubans abandoned their bid for political
asylum and surrendered to police on Thursday after spending a week
holed up in a Czechoslovak diplomat's apartment, according to
reports from Havana.
   The four men and one woman emerged wearing hoods and were taken
away in a Cuban police vehicle, the official Mexican news agency
Notimex said.
   They agreed to leave after assurances they would not be
prosecuted, the official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina and the
Czechoslovak state news agency CTK reported.
   ``After the interrogation of Cuban police, (they) ... will be
allowed to go home, and no legal proceeding will be started against
them,'' CTK said.
   At least eight other asylum-seekers remained on diplomatic
grounds Thursday _ four in the Spanish Embassy and four in the
residence of the Italian ambassador, who is not in Cuba.
   Small bands of Cubans seeking asylum began taking refuge at
diplomatic missions eight days ago.
   Prensa Latina said Thursday's surrender was negotiated with a
Cuban Foreign Ministry official and a representative of the
Czechoslovak Embassy.
   Hours before they gave up their refuge, the asylum-seekers vowed
to stand fast, Notimex said.
   ``We have decided to stay here, at least as long as the food
holds out!'' one yelled to reporters outside the building, Notimex
said, quoting unidentified journalists.
   The agency said a special Czechoslovak security squad arrived in
Havana Thursday to reinforce security at Prague's diplomatic
missions in Cuba. Spain also reinforced security at its missions in
Havana.
   The five Cubans who surrendered occupied the apartment of Charge
d'Affaires Jan Doemoek July 12, holding Doemoek hostage for a few
hours before he escaped.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said efforts continued to negotiate
the fate of the four Cubans in the Italian ambassador's residence.
   Relations between Spain and Cuba continued to deteriorate over
the asylum crisis. Spain suspended $2.5 million in grants to Cuba
on Thursday and persuaded the European Community to put on hold
three ``symbolic'' aid projects for Cuba.
   On Wednesday, Madrid recalled its ambassador after Cuban police
arrested a young man on Spanish Embassy grounds last Friday.
   Spanish Foreign Minister Fernandez Ordonez has suggested
President Fidel Castro knew his government would crumble if he
opened the door to all Cubans who want to leave. Cuba, a former
Spanish colony, has 11 million people.
   ``The situation in Havana is very nervous due to Cuba's
isolation from the world and because of the extremely serious
economic problems there,'' he said on Spanish National Radio
Wednesday after recalling the ambassador to Havana.
   ``No one wants a catastrophe there. What is needed is a peaceful
transition to democracy,'' he said.
   Cuba has accused Spain of violating Cuban and international law
by harboring asylum-seekers and swore never to yield to ``pressure
or blackmail'' by people seeking to leave the Caribbean island.
Castro's government portrays the asylum-seekers as ``antisocial
elements'' and says none of them has a legitimate political reason
for wanting to leave Cuba.
   The Cuban media meanwhile played up the case of 11 human rights
activists convicted of counterrevolutionary crimes, Prensa Latina
said.
   The prosecutor accuses U.S. officials in Havana of
``instigating'' the activists, whose are accused of planning to
blow up the National Library and the Cuban Institute of Radio and
Television.
   Prosecutor Sara Nieves said officials at the U.S. Interests
Section in Havana provided logistical support and ``orientation''
to members of Pro-Human Rights Youth, which authorities describe as
the armed wing of the outlawed Pro-Human Rights Party.
   She said the United States used the group to ``foment economic
chaos and carry out terrorist acts.'' Nieves also said the
defendants had been in contact with other Western diplomatic
missions and with Venezuelan diplomats.
   The activists drew sentences ranging from 15 years in prison to
three years of house arrest Wednesday for counterrevolutionary
crimes such as terrorism and rebellion.

   A Navy attack jet with two people
aboard crashed in the Santa Ynez Mountains just north of this
coastal resort, igniting a brush fire that roared across 300 acres,
forest service officials said.
   The jet crashed just before 1 p.m. in the Los Padres National
Forest about 11 miles north of the city, said U.S. Forest Service
spokesman Maeton Freel. Firefighting aircraft began dumping slurry
on the raging flames.
   The two crew members were rescued near the crash site at about
2:30 p.m., one by a Navy helicopter and the other by a Coast Guard
helicopter, said Bob Hubbert, a spokesman for the Point Mugu Naval
Air Station. Both apparently parachuted out of the plane before it
crashed, he said.
   The pilot was taken to Goleta Valley Hospital, said Donna
Fogarty, a hospital spokeswoman. ``He is alert and awake and in
good condition,'' said Ms. Fogarty. She could not provide specifics
information his injuries.
   The other crew member, who also was not identified, apparently
was not seriously injured.
   The Navy A-7 Corsair jet crashed at 12:55 p.m. while on a
training mission, Hubbert said. The cause of the crash was unknown.
   The cause of the crash was unknown.
   Some 250 firefighters were battling the blaze, which was burning
northward. No structures were threatened, Freel said.
   Firefighters were being hampered by hot and humid weather and
rugged terrain, he said.
   The fire broke out near Gibralter Reservoir, just north of Santa
Barbara, which was struck by a devastating brush fire June 27 that
killed one person and caused more than $300 million in damage to
more than 600 homes.

   Prince Norodom Sihanouk on Thursday
criticized a cutback in U.S. support for his guerrilla coalition,
saying that would only make it ``more firm and fierce'' in battling
the Cambodian government.
   China indicated it would continue its crucial aid to the Khmer
Rouge, while some of the coalition's other allies in Southeast Asia
said they doubted the U.S. shift would promote a peaceful
settlement.
   Cambodia's government, along with its Vietnamese backers,
welcomed the U.S. move Wednesday to withdraw recognition of the
resistance coalition and open a dialogue with Vietnam on resolving
the 11-year-old civil war.
   Britain also praised the U.S. decision and said it also opposes
the Cambodian resistance alliance, dominated by the fanatical Khmer
Rouge, having Cambodia's seat at the United Nations.
   The U.S. decision reflected fears of a resurgence of the
Communist Khmer Rouge, which killed or starved to death hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians in slave labor camps and in rural villages
during their 1975-78 rule. Vietnam invaded in late 1978 and
installed the current government.
   Some analysts say the U.S. move could open the way for
diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam,
estranged since the end of the Vietnam War in April 1975.
   The Soviet vice minister of foreign affairs, Igor Rogachev, said
Southeast Asia could not achieve real stability without normal
diplomatic ties between the United States and Vietnam and Cambodia.
   ``For the moment, there isn't normalization, but we hope there
soon will be,'' he said in Paris.
   Sihanouk, a non-Communist who leads the three-party resistance
coalition, said the U.S. move was ``an act of very serious
injustice.''
   The coalition now will be ``more firm and fierce in their
determination to continue to resist,'' he said in a statement from
North Korea's capital of Pyongyang, where he lives part of the year.
   It will only keep alive a government in Cambodia that is ``a
creature and creation'' of Vietnam, he said.
   Phnom Penh's official SPK news agency quoted a foreign ministry
spokesman welcoming the U.S. shift as ``paving the way for
achievement of an early political settlement.''
   The official Vietnam News Agency quoted Vietnam's Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach as applauding the U.S. move.
   Thach said Hanoi wanted ``an early, fair and equitable solution
... (and) is ready to negotiate with concerned countries on the
Cambodia issue.''
   Some guerrilla leaders said the U.S. shift could force them
closer to China and strengthen the Khmer Rouge.
   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, son of Sihanouk and commander of his
army, said Wednesday that if the United States suspends its $7
million in annual aid to the non-Communist guerrillas, China has
promised to double that amount.
   ``To cut off the non-Communist resistance you will strengthen
the Khmer Rouge,'' he said.
   Peace talks have foundered. The guerrillas reject Phnom Penh's
wish to retain power in the period leading to elections.
   The guerrillas want to share power or have the United Nations
assume authority. Sihanouk and the head of the third guerrilla
group, former Prime Minister Son Sann, have refused Phnom Penh's
demand they abandon the Khmer Rouge.
   They say the group would only fight on if excluded from a
settlement.
   In Beijing Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua said
all Cambodian factions must be included in any political settlement.
   ``So long as Vietnam does not withdraw all its troops from
Cambodia genuinely, China will continue to support the Cambodian
people in their resistance against the foreign invaders,'' he told
a news conference.
   Thailand also has not indicated it will decrease its sanctuary,
logistical and other support to the guerrillas.
   The U.S. shift will not affect the Khmer Rouge militarily, and
``might push them to concentrate on a military solution,'' said a
Thai official involved in the aid program, who spoke on condition
he not be named.
   The Khmer Rouge's 30,000-member army is reported to have struck
in virtually every province in Cambodia, attacking five provincial
capitals in recent weeks.

<HEAD>10,000 Rally in Timisoara to Demand that Romania's Leader Quit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TIMISOARA, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 10,000 people Thursday
demanded the resignation of President Ion Iliescu during a
demonstration in this western city that gave birth to Romania's
anti-Communist revolution.
   The protesters, who equated Iliescu with communism, also called
on his government to step down and urged the release of a jailed
activist.
   In a main square of Timisoara, the demonstrators accused Iliescu
and his government of a new form of totalitarian rule. They cheered
``Down with Communism!'' and ``Down with Iliescu!''
   Iliescu, a former Communist official, won free elections in May,
but opponents demanded he step down because of his hard-line past.
He has repeatedly said he favors democracy and a free-market
economy.
   Timisoara is the Transylvania city where street protests touched
off a revolution in December against Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu. He and his wife Elena were executed Dec. 25 under orders
of a revolutionary tribunal.
   In an open letter to the government, the demonstrators Thursday
also urged the release of Marian Munteanu, the leader of a 53-day
round-the-clock opposition rally broken up by police last month.
   Munteanu was later badly beaten by rampaging miners answering an
Iliescu call for help against anti-government rioters. She was
arrested on suspicion of involvement in the riots.
   Earlier Thursday, Iliescu promised university students he would
contact the prosecutor general about Munteanu.
   But he told students seeking Munteanu's release that ``it is the
task of justice to take a decision'' in the case, the state Rompres
news agency said.
   Munteanu's detention ignited a mass protest July 13, when 20,000
demonstrators marched in Bucharest to demand his release. It was
the largest rally since the December revolution.
   The world community harshly criticized Iliescu for the miners'
rampage, and the United States and other Western nations cut off
all non-humanitarian aid to Romania.
   On Wednesday, Premier Petre Roman told French President Francois
Mitterrand that ``it is possible that Marian Munteanu will be set
free.'' Roman was visiting France.
   The open letter from Thursday's demonstrators also asked the
government to ``cast light'' on what happened to Securitate,
Ceausescu's feared secret police, as well as the dictator's hard
currency accounts and the funds of the Communist Party.

<TEXT>
   Bad weather hindered rescuers looking for 42
climbers killed in an avalanche in the Pamir mountains in Central
Asia, Tass said Thursday. It said the toll could mount if the snow
had engulfed other, unregistered groups.
   An earthquake last Friday set off the avalanche that hit the
base camp of a Soviet-Swiss expedition at 16,000 feet, more than
two-thirds up Lenin Peak, 1,800 miles southeast of Moscow.
   About 55 to 60 people were at the camp at the time, including
Bulgarian and East German climbers and Soviet tourists, the Soviet
news agency said.
   Victims included 23 members of the Leningrad climbing team, four
climbers from Israel, six from Czechoslovakia, two from Switzerland
and one from Spain.
   ``The search, which is being conducted despite very cold
weather, the snow storm and gusting winds, is very risky,'' Tass
quoted the newspaper Sovetsky Sport as reporting.
   ``The avalanche sent the climbers, who were in the camp at the
moment of the catastrophe, tumbling down into deep fissures and
covered them with snow.'' It said the earthquake, centered in
Afghanistan, caused a huge slab of ice to split from a glacier,
``which, in turn, started the colossal avalanche, engulfing the
camp with more than 40 mountaineers.''
   Three climbers were found alive, and two of them were
hospitalized.
   Konstantin Leonov, chief of the Tadzhik Mountaineering Rescue
Service, told Tass the camp has existed for more than 10 years and
was considered ``to a considerable extent safe. However, absolute
security in the mountains in non-existent.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Accuse Administration of Withholding Owl Information</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration suppressed a
government report that offered ways to reduce significantly the
timber job losses that would result from protection of the rare
northern spotted owl, two Northwest lawmakers charged Thursday.
   Reps. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., gsaid
the May 1 report was leaked to them by ``a source in the
administration.''
   The White House declined comment. A spokesman for Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said the report was an internal document
that never was intended for release.
   ``They are just playing partisan politics,'' said the spokesman,
Steve Goldstein.
   The report prepared by the Forest Service, an arm of ther
Agriculture Department, and the Bureau of Land Management, part of
the Interior Department, outlines ways to save as many as 21,000
timber jobs by, among other things, adding new restrictions on log
exports and boosting spending on Forest Service programs, DeFazio
said.
   He said it was prepared for release at the same time the two
agencies projected that one controversial plan to save the owl
would cut timber harvests in the region by nearly 50 percent and
cost the region more than 28,000 jobs by the end of the decade.
   Each nesting pair of owls needs large areas of undisturbed
old-growth forest to survive. The Fish and Wildlife Service last
month classified the owl as an endangered species, which means the
government must come up with a protection plan.
   The Bush administration has not drafted complete plans, but has
said it expects 1,000 timber jobs in the Northwest will be lost.
Bush has said he wants to balance the needs of timber communities
against owl protection.
   ``This report has been suppressed by the administration,''
DeFazio said during a hastily called news conference at his office.
   ``I find it absolutely outrageous that the administration on May
1 could give on us one-half of the equation _ that is they dropped
on us the job impacts, the fear of loss of livelihood that came to
so many thousands of people in the Pacific Northwest.
   DeFazio said Forest Service workers have told him of the report
and have been urging him to obtain a copy of it for several weeks,
but he said administrators denied it existed.
   Goldstein declined comment on the allegation that administration
officials denied the document existed: ``I can't speak to that. I
don't know who they talked to,'' he said.

   The Minnesota Supreme Court overturned a
$700,000 damage award to a man who sued the state's two largest
daily newspapers for revealing his identity after he was promised
anonymity.
   In a 4-2 decision to be filed Friday, the state's highest court
said the Saint Paul Pioneer Press and the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis could not be held liable for breaking reporters'
promises of confidentiality to Dan Cohen in 1982.
   The ruling, which one attorney called a ``major victory'' for
news organizations, upheld a state Appeals Court panel's dismissal
of Cohen's claim of fraudulent misrepresentation, but reversed that
court's ruling allowing his breach-of-contract claim.
   ``To impose a contract theory on this arrangement puts an
unwarranted legal rigidity on a special ethical relationship,
precluding necessary consideration of factors underlying that
ethical relationship,'' Associate Justice John Simonett wrote for
the majority.
   The court also said enforcement of the promise of
confidentiality under a doctrine that implies a legal contract
where none exists in fact would violate the newspapers' First
Amendment rights.
   Cohen's attorney, Elliot Rothenberg, said Thursday the case will
be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``This case isn't over by a long shot,'' Rothenberg said.
   ``It's a very important case, one with far-reaching
implications,'' he said. ``The issue is, to what extent do
newspapers and the media have a constitutional right to violate
promises to which everyone else in society would be held liable?''
   Attorneys for The Associated Press, which filed the only
friend-of-the-court brief in the case, said Cohen's trial court
victory had produced a spate of similar lawsuits around the country.
   The latest decision is ``the first definitive opinion by a
supreme court of a state directly addressing'' the issues in
Cohen's case, and one in which the news media ``can take
considerable comfort,'' said attorney Dick Winfield of the Rogers
and Wells law firm in New York, the AP's general counsel.
   Louise Sommers, also of Rogers and Wells, said the ruling was a
``major victory'' for the news media.
   The newspapers and the AP were able to ``convince the Supreme
Court that the First Amendment mattered in a case like this, where
a source who had grounds to sue for conventional libel chose to
mask it as a breach-of-contract suit,'' she said.
   The case stemmed from a 1982 incident in which Cohen gave
reporters copies of court documents showing that Marlene Johnson,
then seeking her first term as lieutenant governor, had been
convicted of shoplifting 12 years earlier.
   Johnson's conviction was vacated in 1971 with no sentence. She
was elected as Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich's running mate in 1982,
re-elected in 1986 and is running with Perpich this year.
   Cohen, who was doing public relations work for 1982 Republican
gubernatorial candidate Wheelock Whitney, provided information
about Johnson on condition he not be identified.
   Reporters for the newspapers gave him that assurance, but
editors decided to name Cohen as their source of the documents.
Editors testified that they named Cohen because they felt the
public had a right to know the information came from the Whitney
campaign.
   Reporters for the AP and WCCO-TV also promised Cohen anonymity
and received the documents. The AP published the story and honored
its promise, while the television station did not run the story.
   Cohen claimed in his lawsuit that he lost his advertising agency
job after the newspapers breached an oral contract to keep his name
out of the story.
   In rejecting Cohen's argument that contract law should apply to
his case, the Supreme Court majority said, ``We are not persuaded
that in the special milieu of media newsgathering a source and a
reporter ordinarily believe they are engaged in making a legally
binding contract.
   ``They are not thinking in terms of offers and acceptances in
any commercial or business sense,'' the majority said. ``The
parties understand that the reporter's promise of anonymity is
given as a moral commitment, but a moral obligation alone will not
support a contract.''
   In addressing whether a promise of confidentiality might
otherwise be enforceable, the court said it had to balance the
constitutional rights of a free press against the common-law
interest of protecting a promise of anonymity.
   ``Of critical significance in this case ... is the fact that the
promise of anonymity arises in the classic First Amendment context
of the quintessential public debate in our democratic society,
namely, a political source involved in a political campaign,'' the
court said.
   ``The potentiality for civil damages for promises made in this
context chills public debate, a debate which Cohen willingly
entered albeit hoping to do so on his own terms. In this context,
and considering the nature of the political story involved, it
seems to us that the law best leaves the parties here to their
trust in each other.''
   In his dissent, Associate Justice Lawrence Yetka said the result
of the majority opinion was to ``carve out yet another special
privilege in favor of the press that is denied other citizens.''
   Associate Justice Glenn Kelley, who joined Yetka's dissent, said
the decision ``serves to inhibit rather than to promote the
objectives of the First Amendment by `drying up' potential sources
of information on public matters.''
   Chief Justice Peter Popovich took no part in the decision.
   Saint Paul Pioneer Press attorney Paul Hannah said the court's
majority recognized the difficulties editors and reporters face in
``making decisions about what voters are going to know about the
candidates and campaigns.''
   Star Tribune Executive Editor Joel R. Kramer said in a statement
for release Friday that the newspaper was ``especially pleased that
the court has ruled that the decision to publish true facts
relating to the activities of `a political source in a political
campaign' is one that is protected by the First Amendment.''
   The court, following its policy, allowed attorneys in the case
to be contacted Thursday, but forbade contacts with parties in the
case until Friday.

<HEAD>Singapore Bars Reporters from Covering Conference</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday that reporters for
The Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review
would be barred from covering the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference.
   The three-day conference, which begins July 29, will discuss the
economic course of the Asia-Pacific region. Representatives of the
United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan,
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Singapore
are attending.
   The government has been at odds with the Journal and the Review,
a weekly magazine, for several years over alleged interference in
the domestic politics of this island city-state. Both are published
in Hong Kong by Dow Jones &amp; Co. of the United States.
   Dow Jones in a statement Thursday from New York said that ``for
reasons that are unclear'' it appears Singapore ``is extending its
long-asserted right to restrict coverage of Singapore for
Singaporean readers (and) restrict coverage of international
economic meetings for all Asians.
   ``Dow Jones fears that the government's actions against the
Review and Asian Journal are therefore entirely coercive or
punitive,'' the statement said.
   In 1987, the government required the Journal to reduce its daily
circulation here to about 500 copies from 5,000. The Review was
ordered to cut its circulation to 400-500 copies a week from 10,000
but the magazine refused to continue selling in Singapore.
   The Dow Jones statement also noted ``that Singapore has given
reporters for the U.S. edition of the Journal and for AP-Dow Jones
permission to attend'' the conference.
   AP-Dow Jones is a joint venture of The Associated Press and Dow
Jones.
   On Wednesday, the government introduced a bill in Parliament
that would require foreign newspapers wishing to circulate in
Singapore to get permission annually.

<TEXT>
   Neighborhood merchants are cheering, but
advocates for the homeless have cried foul over a newly-enforced
policy to hose down the sidewalks around New York City's main bus
station throughout the day.
   The policy is aimed at keeping the homeless and their bodily
wastes off the pavement around the Port Authority Bus Terminal,
which has become a magnet for those without shelter.
   The sidewalks are being hosed down every couple of hours for 16
hours starting at 6 a.m.
   ``I think it's the greatest idea in the world and I started
doing it too,'' said Vincent Dimino, owner of the Seabreeze Fish
Market on Ninth Avenue across from the terminal and president of
the 40th Street Merchants Association.
   ``Between the urination ... and everything else they put out on
the street we have to keep it clean and that's the only way we
can,'' Dimino said Thursday.
   But Mary Brosnahan, director of the Coalition for the Homeless,
said she felt ``utter frustration'' because of the policy.
   ``We've shoved them off the platforms, we've kicked them off the
trains and now we are literally flushing them off our sidewalks,''
Brosnahan said.
   ``I don't know how to get the message across _ the shell game
doesn't work.''
   The summertime policy has been in effect two years but wasn't
enforced until June 1 because of water restrictions, according to a
Port Authority spokeswoman, Lynn Tierney.
   Tierney said the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has
been ``in the forefront of providing social services for the
homeless'' over the past 10 years, including providing a drop-in
center across the street from the bus terminal.
   ``We're in a constant struggle to balance the rights and
expectations of the 200,000 people that commute through this
facility every day with the needs of the homeless population that
have made this facility their home,'' she said.
   The homeless had to be moved from the sidewalks, along with
their wastes, for health and safety reasons, she said, adding that
a concrete stairway had to be replaced because of accumulated
wastes.
   ``We've had situations at times where people had built entire
towns out of cardboard along the 41st Street side of the
building,'' Tierney said.
   One problem with the policy has cropped up: water was seeping
into the newly renovated locker room of Port Authority police, but
caulking will be put in to stop the seepage.

   Sixteen years after urging President
Nixon to resign, President Bush praised the nation's 37th chief
executive Thursday and urged fellow Americans to ``look at Richard
Nixon, the man.''
   Bush, standing with Nixon and former presidents Reagan and Ford,
made only passing reference to the Watergate scandal that wrecked
Nixon's presidency, noting only that it was Nixon's ``seventh
crisis.''
   Nixon, who wrote a book called Six Crises, served in
``tumultuous times,'' he said.
   Bush, speaking at the dedication of the Nixon Presidential
Library and Birthplace, focused on Nixon's foreign policy
achievements and other successes. He said, ``Richard Nixon helped
change the course not only of America but of the entire world.''
   He cited Nixon's trip to China and his peace efforts in the
Middle East, and he said, ``Who can forget how in Moscow, Richard
Nixon signed the first agreement to limit strategic nuclear arms _
giving new hope to the world for a lasting peace?''
   Bush credited Nixon with working for ``returning power to the
people'' with revenue sharing and other programs to shift powers to
state and local governments. He also hailed Nixon's environmental
initiatives and his decision to end the military draft.
   At the outdoor ceremony in 90-degree heat, Bush said that he
would say to visitors to the nation's 10th presidential library,
due to open on Friday, ``Look at Richard Nixon the man.''
   A beaming Nixon said, ``This is the first time I've ever been
introduced by the president of the United States.''
   After the dedication, the four presidents had lunch together,
the first time that has happened. Former President Carter was
invited but declined.
   Bush, as chairman of the Republican National Committee, wrote a
letter to Nixon on Aug. 7, 1974, saying his resignation would be
``best for the country.''
   Nixon resigned two days later.
   Before the library ceremony, Bush attended a private
fund-raising reception in Anaheim, Calif., that was expected to
raise $300,000 for the California Republican Party.
   After the dedication ceremony and lunch at the presidential
museum, Bush flew to Boise, Idaho, to bolster the Senate campaign
of Rep. Larry Craig.
   In Boise Bush called on the Democratic-led Congress to break the
impasse over budget negotiations.
   Noting that ``I did my part'' by reversing his 1988 ``no new
taxes'' pledge, Bush told a GOP fundraiser for Republican Senate
candidate Larry Craig: ``Now it's their turn.''
   ``I have said I'll negotiate without preconditions,'' Bush said
in prepared remarks. ``And I will.''
   He called the congressional budget process ``clumsy and
illogical _ and at worst, cynical and chaotic. In short, a metaphor
for what's wrong with Washington today.''
   Bush's ties with Nixon go back to the early 1960s. Nixon stumped
in Texas for Bush in his unsuccessful race for Senate in 1964 and
also appeared at the kickoff of Bush's successful 1966 run for a
House seat from Houston.
   Nixon passed over Bush in picking Spiro Agnew as his running
mate in 1968, but in 1970 he tapped the Texan as U.N. ambassador
and three years later recruiting him as Republican national
chairman.
   In that office, Bush finally wrote to the then-president: ``It
is my considered judgment that you should now resign. ... I now
feel that resignation is best for the country, best for this
president.''
   Bush, as president, has consulted several times with Nixon.
   At one point Thursday, he joked that Nixon's dog while he was
vice president, Checkers, was ``Millie's role model.'' Millie is
the Bush family's pet spaniel.
   Bush praised Nixon as the author of eight books, ``each composed
on his famous yellow legal pads,'' and as a man who, ``like his
favorite author, Tolstoy, admired the dignity of manual labor.''
   He also praised Nixon's wife Pat as ``a mirror of America's
heart and love.''

<HEAD>Electrician's Manslaughter Conviction Leaves Industry Jittery</HEAD>

   The manslaughter conviction of an
electrician whose faulty work caused a fatal fire has left other
electricians worried that honest mistakes could lead to criminal
prosecution.
   Richard E. Salz, 49, of East Haven, was convicted June 1 and
faces sentencing Friday in Superior Court for second-degree
manslaughter in the fire death of a 12-year-old boy. He faces a
maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.
   Phil Simmons, executive director of the Park Ridge, Ill.-based
International Association of Electrical Contractors, said he knew
of no other case in which an electrician has been charged with
manslaughter for a death resulting from his work.
   The boy, Burton Gorman III, died of smoke inhalation in a Dec.
28, 1988, house fire caused by a baseboard heating unit that Salz
had improperly installed the month before.
   Besides failing to get a permit for the work, Salz ignored the
manufacturer's instructions for installing the heater and committed
more than a dozen electrical code violations, witnesses at his
trial said.
   Salz connected the 120-volt heater to a 240-volt circuit box,
doubling the amount of heat that was supposed to come from the
heater, witnesses said. When the unit overheated, it ignited the
wall paneling.
   Lou Acampora, president of the Connecticut Electrical
Contractors Association, said that while Salz had shown a ``total
disregard for safety,'' the conviction set a bad precedent.
   ``It puts a lot of good electricians in jeopardy for making a
mistake,'' said Acampora, who said the heads of trade groups in
neighboring New York also had expressed concern about the ruling.
   The case also has drawn the attention of electricians in other
parts of the country, said Simmons, a former chief electrical
inspector for the state of Washington.
   ``I hope it has a sobering effect and that people realize they
will be held responsible for their actions,'' he said.
   Authorities involved in the prosecution said the fears of a
precedent are unfounded. They say Salz, who at one time worked as a
part-time electrical inspector, was charged only because he
recklessly took actions he should have known would cause a fire
hazard.
   ``This was not just John Q. Public making an honest mistake,''
said Lawrence Acquarulo, an assistant state building inspector who
testified at Salz's jury trial.
   Salz's license as a contractor was revoked in July 1989, but the
state Electrical Work Examining Board this spring gave him a
journeyman's license allowing him to work under supervision.

<TEXT>
   President Bush told civic leaders involved
in fighting drugs that he thinks the tide is turning in the
national war against illegal narcotics.
   Bush spent 45 minutes before a political fund-raiser for
Republican Senate candidate Larry Craig in a roundtable discussion
on drugs with Mayor Dirk Kempthorne and nine others.
   ``There are some signs that create a sense of optimism,'' said
Bush, citing surveys that indicate cocaine use is down among high
school seniors.
   ``I don't want to sound euphoric about it,'' he said, but
``we're making some headway.''
   Kempthorne told Bush, ``Boise is not immune from the drug
scourge. We have our tragedy as well as our triumphs.''
   But he and other local leaders portrayed a city that has the
police, educators, drug treatment experts and ordinary citizens
pulling together.
   John Southworth, 52, a recovered cocaine addict who is now a
licensed drug abuse counselor, told Bush his personal tale of
recovery.
   ``Myself, I was allowed to manipulate the criminal justice with
seven DUIs (driving under the influence) and received no
alcohol-drug evaluation, no treatment or any education,'' he said.
``I ended up going to harder drugs. I started up with marijuana and
ended up free-basing and selling cocaine.''
   Finally, he got help and went into recovery 7{ years ago,
Southworth said.
   ``Education doesn't work alone. Treatment doesn't work alone,
and law enforcement doesn't work alone,'' he said. ``We must fight
this problem together''.
   Bush appeared intrigued by the man's personal tale and asked if
he found drugs readily available.
   ``They were for me. Birds of a feather flock together,'' said
Southworth. ``There was no problem for a coke addict to find coke.''
   ``Is that supply still as readily available, would you reckon?''
Bush asked.
   ``I've been sober for 7{ years, and I don't hang out with those
people anymore,'' Southworth said, evoking laughter.
   But Police Chief James Carvino said, ``You can get drugs if
you're looking to get drugs.'' Carvino also said the federal war on
drugs has driven ``drug entrepreneurs'' to move their business to
smaller cities.
   Greg Bower, the Ada County prosecutor, praised the work of a
narcotics task force operating under a $200,000 federal grant, and
urged Bush to keep up that support.
   ``Drug traffickers are afraid of the federal government. They're
afraid of federal prosecutors and federal mandatory minimum
sentences,'' Bower said.
   Bush said the war on drugs is not going to be won ``through
mandated federal programs'' but community efforts like the one
Boise is mounting.
   Kempthorne, the mayor, assured him that ``City Hall is ready to
join your White House'' in the fight.
   Bush came to Idaho after attending the dedication of Richard M.
Nixon's presidential library in Yorba Linda, Calif. He was leaving
later Thursday for Billings, Mont.

   Democratic Rep. Lindy Boggs scheduled a
Friday news conference amid reports she will not run for
re-election to the congressional seat she and her late husband have
held for 46 years.
   Mrs. Boggs, 74 has been widely reported as planning to retire to
spend more time with her daughter, Barbara Sigmund, who is
suffering from cancer.
   Her office in Washington refused to confirm or deny the reports
Thursday.
   Mrs. Boggs is the only white member of Congress representing a
black-majority district. She has been on Capitol Hill 17 years; her
husband Hale had held the seat for all but two terms starting in
1940.
   Mrs. Boggs took over the post in March 1973 after winning a
special election to succeed her husband, the powerful House
majority leader, whose plane disappeared during a flight over
Alaska in 1972.
   The primary election for the 2nd Congressional District, which
encompasses most of New Orleans, will be Oct. 6. A runoff, if
needed, would be Nov. 6.
   At least two prominent candidates, both Democrats, hope to
become Louisiana's first black congressman.
   State Sen. Jon Johnson kicked off his campaign in April. Marc
Morial, a lawyer and the elder son of the late Mayor Dutch Morial,
had a gala reception Thursday night to formally announce his
candidacy.
   State Sen. William Jefferson has said he will probably enter the
race if Mrs. Boggs steps out. Some analysts have predicted New
Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy might enter the race as well.
   Hale Boggs won the seat in 1940. He lost a re-election bid in
1942, but reclaimed the job in 1946. Boggs was one of the few
Southern Democrats in Congress to support the civil rights movement
in the 1960s.

   A man who was shot and critically
wounded while responding to a stranger's scream for help has always
tried to lend a hand to people in trouble, his wife said Thursday.
   ``That's how he is. He just cares about people. He doesn't want
anybody to get hurt,'' Sandra Smith said of her husband, Gary.
``He'll always help anybody.''
   Smith, 35, was shot in the face, arm, leg and abdomen Wednesday
after confronting a fleeing burglar whose break-in was cut short by
a resident who surprised him.
   Smith was in extremely critical condition Thursday at Scripps
Memorial Hospital in this San Diego suburb, where he underwent
three operations within 24 hours, hospital spokeswoman Edie High
said.
   Two bullets remained lodged in his head and abdomen and his
prognosis was guarded, meaning doctors didn't know whether his
condition would improve or deteriorate. Smith was expected to
undergo more operations, High said.
   Just three days before the shooting, Smith tried to help another
crime victim, his wife told a hospital news conference.
   ``We were shopping (Sunday) at Mission Valley Center, and we
heard a woman screaming in the underground parking lot,'' she said.
``Gary ran down the stairs to help, and found the woman had just
had her purse taken by a purse snatcher.''
   Mrs. Smith maintained a vigil at the hospital while friends and
relatives cared for the couple's three children. She said she has
seen her husband, but couldn't talk to him.
   If she could, ``I'd tell I love him and we need him,'' she said.
   Smith, who has two daughters and a son aged 9 months to 7 years
old, was laying carpet in a San Diego condominium Wednesday when he
heard a woman's scream from an adjacent unit, police Officer Robert
Chorny said.
   The woman, Christiane Chazin, had arrived home to find her door
unlocked and an intruder in the living room.
   The burglar, brandishing a gun, brushed past Mrs. Chazin and her
3-year-old son Daniel, warning them not to move, Chorny said.
   Smith arrived a moment later, and ran after the man. Police said
they didn't know if Smith knew the man was armed.
   He caught up with the burglar a block and a half later, and
after a brief struggle was shot at close range with a .22-caliber
pistol, Chorny said.
   Police said they were pursuing a couple of leads in the case,
including the attempted use of a credit card stolen from the Chazin
home.
   The San Diego Police Officers Assocation donated 21 units of
blood from its account at the San Diego Blood Bank to help Smith,
said police Sgt. Willie P. Smith, no relation to Gary Smith.
   It was believed to be the first time the association has taken
such action for someone other than a law enforcement officer, said
Sgt. Smith, who is director of the association.
   ``The guy was trying to help. He put himself in jeopardy by
trying to do a job we do all the time,'' the sergeant said. ``In
essence, during that time he made himself one of us.''

<TEXT>
   A confessed killer who was
acquitted because of a typing error in a police report will not be
retried.
   Palm Beach Circuit Judge Marvin Mounts on Wednesday dismissed a
first-degree murder charge against Frank ``Mr. Lucky'' Mars, ending
years of legal wrangling over the case.
   In 1983, Mars confessed to murdering a friend but was acquitted
because the time of death listed in a legal document submitted as
evidence was off by 12 hours.
   The document said Mars shot Willie Berry between ``5 o'clock
P.M. January 29, 1983 and 12:59 A.M. January 30, 1983.''
   The entry should have read ``12:59 P.M.''
   Testimony presented by prosecutors showed that Berry could not
have been killed until after 1:30 a.m., when he left a party with
Mars to buy cigarettes.
   When prosecutors sought to retry the case with corrected
documents, the defense cited double-jeopardy objections and Mounts
agreed.
   The case was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court and the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which in March upheld Mounts'
decision.
   He dismissed the charge Wednesday.
   ``You can't let your personal beliefs make your ruling,'' he
said. ``The ruling must be based on the law.''
   Mars' attorneys hailed the decision as a simple defense of a
basic constitutional right. The double jeopardy clause of the Fifth
Amendment provides that a person cannot be tried twice for the same
offense.
   ``They were seeking to put my client in the electric chair,''
said Assistant Public Defender Cherry Grant. ``I'm sorry, but if
you're going to kill someone, you'd better dot all your i's and
cross all your t's.''
   Mars is scheduled for release in 1991 from Glades Correctional
Institution, where he is imprisoned for violating the terms of
parole on an earlier conviction.

   Stunned campers said they found a baby girl in an
outhouse pit, where the crying newborn apparently had been
abandoned for at least nine hours.
   ``Not in my worst nightmare did I think something like this
could ever happen in this world,' said Cheryl Ramirez, one of the
campers at the Lower Log Campground in east-central Arizona.
   Mary Lou Ramirez, Cheryl Ramirez' sister, said she thought she
heard a whimper when she visited the privy around 5:30 a.m.
Saturday.
   ``And I thought an animal, maybe a cat, had fallen in,'' she
said.`` But I didn't think anything more about it right then and
forgot about it.''
   She returned to the privy around 2:30 p.m. ``I heard the cry
again. And this time, I knew it couldn't be an animal. It had to be
a baby.''
   Mrs. Ramirez summoned her husband, Louie, and his brother,
Ernie, who used a flashlight to find the baby. The infant was lying
on her stomach, with her face turned to one side.
   The brothers raced to Hon Dah on the Fort Apache Indian
Reservation eight miles to the northwest, and telephoned police.
With help from the Ramirez brothers, police and fire personnel
tipped over the outhouse and rescued the baby.
   The child was released Tuesday from Tucson Medical Center in
Tucson, and was placed in temporary custody of the state Department
of Economic Security's child protection services unit.

   Sixty Panamanian companies sued the U.S.
government Thursday to recover more than $30 million in damages
caused by vandalism and looting that occurred after last year's
invasion.
   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan claims the
U.S. violated international law and treaties by failing to provide
security in Panama after the military action.
   The complaint also alleges that the U.S. military used excessive
force that resulted in damage to some of the businesses.
   The four-page lawsuit did not contain specific incidents.
   The alleged acts of the U.S. government were ``all done in a
tortuous, careless and negligent manner with disregard for the
property of innocent Panamanian residents,'' the lawsuit said.
   U.S. military forces invaded Panama on Dec. 20 to overthrow Gen.
Manuel Noriega and bring him to the U.S. to stand trial on drug
charges.
   Looting that followed the invasion, which stripped all
Panamanian security forces of power, cost companies between $1
billion and $2 billion.
   The plaintiffs are Panamanian stores and factories and foreign
companies that lost about $30 million in damage, said Dennis T.
D'Antonio, their New York lawyer.
   A State Department spokeswoman referred a request for comment to
the Pentagon, where a duty officer said Thursday evening that no
one was available.

   A U.S. delegation will go to Angola this
weekend to confer with Angola's Marxist government about stalled
peace talks with the country's U.S.-armed rebels and about efforts
to feed more than a million hungry Angolans, the State Department
said Thursday.
   Jeffrey Davidow, the No. 2 official in the department's African
affairs bureau, Jim Woods of the Defense Department and two other
officials will travel to Luanda on Saturday, the department said.
   Despite the urgency of providing food in both government and
rebel-held territory, international relief efforts have been
stalled by disagreement between the warring sides over supply
routes.
   Several international donors have revoked their pledges because
of backlogs at Angola's ports and pilfering of relief supplies.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross, leading the relief
project, has decided that airlifts are too expensive and is trying
to arrange safe passage through land corridors for trucks.
   The organization estimates 250,000 people are in immediate need
and hundreds of thousands more are in less dire straits.
   Angola's government wants the food delivered via Port Namibe on
its western coast and from there trucked to government and rebel
areas.
   The UNITA rebels, led by U.S. protege Jonas Savimbi, want the
food delivered through Namibia and Botswana, which border territory
it controls in southern Angola. But the Angolan government says it
is worried weapons could be smuggled to the rebels with the food.
   The U.S. team will tell the Angolans that the administration
favors multiple routes for the supplies so that as much food as
possible gets in, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition that
his name not be used.
   It will also urge Angola to return to peace talks with the
rebels, which broke off last month in Portugal and have not
resumed, said the official.
   The United States has no formal diplomatic relations with Angola.
   Angola's ambassador to the United Nations, Manuel Pacavira, met
Thursday with Davidow and other officials. He told reporters later
that he had promised his government would protect all foreign
relief convoys.

   The House ethics committee voted without
dissent Thursday to recommend a reprimand of Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., for his relationship with male prostitute Stephen Gobie,
according to sources familiar with the closed-door deliberations.
   The reprimand would be a more severe sanction against Frank than
Democrats on the 12-member panel had been advocating.
   ``That's what people (in the House) were sort of expecting would
happen,'' said one source.
   The committee was concerned not only with Frank's sexual
relationship to Gobie but with actions he took on Gobie's behalf.
   Committee members refused to discuss the case and Frank refused
to comment. One member, Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, was back in his
home state for a visit by President Bush and it was not known
whether he had voted by proxy.
   The committee hurriedly left its meeting room after more than
two hours of discussion. Members all but ignored reporters waiting
outside.
   ``The committee is adjourned. I have no statement,'' said Rep.
Julian Dixon, D-Calif., the committee chairman.
   The committee, which has been looking into the Frank case for 10
months, scheduled no new meetings.
   Among matters of concern to the committee were the fact that
Frank wrote favorable letters on his congressional letterhead to
court officials who were supervising Gobie's probation on several
felony convictions. He also invoked congressional privilege to
waive parking tickets incurred by Gobie while using Frank's car.
   Frank said he only sought to have the tickets waived when Gobie
was using the car for official business.
   The recommendation would have to be voted on by the House.
Reprimand is a relatively new punishment, having been used against
six members since 1976, and simply consists of a vote to accept the
committee report.
   The committee could have recommended the more severe censure,
used before 1976, in which the member must stand before his
colleagues as a resolution condemning his behavior is read. Or it
could have recommended expulsion, which no one expected.
   First word of the committee's decision was broadcast by CBS and
NBC in their evening news programs.
   The House committee's action comes a day after its Senate
counterpart recommended that the Senate denounce Sen. Dave
Durenberger, R-Minn., for financial misconduct and require him to
pay $124,000 to the Senate or to charities as restitution.
   The case has been one of the most difficult ever considered by
the ethics panel, because what it dealt with was personal behavior
rather than official duties. Conservatives on the 12-member panel
have been holding out for a strong punishment, which would involve
a vote by the full House criticizing Frank's behavior.
   When the case first became public late last summer, Frank
admitted that he paid Gobie $80 for sex in 1985 and then hired him
as a housekeeper and driver with personal funds.
   He said he fired Gobie in August 1987 after learning that Gobie
was running a prostitution ring out of Frank's Capitol Hill
apartment.
   Frank has repeatedly denied Gobie's allegation that he was aware
of the prostitution long before he ended the relationship.
   In past cases, the committee has voted and not released the
decision for a day or two. Dixon touched off speculation that the
panel may have done just that Thursday when he said, without being
asked, that he would not comment on any votes the committee may or
may not have taken. But neither Dixon nor other members would
discuss the deliberations.
   Frank, in an interview in his office, said he had not received
word from any committee member on Thursday's meeting. He declined
to discuss the committee deliberations and said he had no idea when
the panel planned to meet again.
   ``I have gotten no word, official or unofficial,'' Frank said.
   The committee, made up of six Democrats and six Republicans, had
been deadlocked on the severity of punishment Frank should receive.
Democrats reportedly wanted to issue a letter of reproval, one of
the mildest sanctions possible because it would not require a vote
of the full House on Frank's conduct. Republican committee members
had pushed for a tougher sanction.
   Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., has said he would seek a vote
to expel Frank if the ethics committee sought a lesser sanction.
   Frank, a five-term liberal Democrat representing a group of
Boston suburbs, is one of two acknowledged homosexual members of
the House. He is seeking re-election in a race against Republican
John Soto, who has never held public office and who was soundly
defeated two years ago in a bid for state representative in his
home town.

<HEAD>Canadian Official: Government Would Buy Land Claimed by Mohawks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with federal official qualifying

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada's minister of Indian affairs said
Thursday that the government is ready to buy a land tract claimed
as ancestral territory by armed Mohawks, but told the Indians they
must first lay down their weapons.
   Earlier in the day, an Indian spokeswoman demanded the federal
government provide additional guarantees over a parcel of land that
municipal leaders want to build a golf course addition on before
the Mohawks would put down their arms.
   The standoff centers on a 55-acre tract in Oka, a town 18 miles
west of Montreal where the addition is planned. A federal purchase
or expropriation of the disputed land would block the project,
which the Indians oppose.
   The Indians have barricaded themselves at the site for four
months.The confrontation has left one police officer dead and
prompted an anti-Indian backlash. It was not clear if the officer
was shot to death on July 11 by fellow police or Indians.
   At his news conference Thursday in Ottawa, Indian Affairs
Minister Tom Siddon said the federal government ``is prepared to
pursue the acquisition of that land'' to settle the Mohawk claim.
He said expropriation could be used by the province if necessary.
   He added that Ottawa recognizes the inadequacy of the Mohawk
land base at Oka as a problem to be resolved. The Mohawks live in a
centuries-old community there, but it has not been recognized by
the federal government as a bona fide reservation.
   Siddon insisted, however, that the process of land acquisition
``is a very long way down the road.''
   ``We won't talk while there are barricades, and we won't talk in
circumstances where firearms are used to provoke negotiations,''
Siddon told reporters.
   His remarks threw some cold water on an announcement earlier in
the day by a provincial official.
   At the earlier news conference in Montreal, Quebec's native
affairs minister, John Ciaccia, said federal officials have
approved the purchase or expropriation of the tract of forest.
However, he made no mention of the federal demand that the Indians
lay down their weapons before any more talks.
   In remarks after Ciaccia's announcement, Indian negotiator Ellen
Gabriel said that before any land deal, several earlier Mohawk
conditions to end the armed standoff must be met.
   They include allowing the shipment of food, water, clothing,
bedding and medical supplies to the Indians, as well as granting
entry to independent observers from the United Nations or Amnesty
International, a human rights group.
   The Mohawk spokeswoman demanded a 48-hour grace period to allow
any Mohawks behind barricades to leave without police interference.
   ``There are demands to be met, and we're ready to continue as
long as it takes,'' she said.
   Solicitor General Pierre Cadieux, at the news conference with
Siddon, said ``If you're asking me my personal opinion, there
should not be any amnesty.''
   In recent days, Indian leaders and provincial officials have
been stepping up pressure for the federal government in Ottawa to
intervene in the dispute.
   Indian groups across Canada rallied to the aid of the Mohawks on
Thursday.
   Indians from the Grand Rapids reserve near Lake Winnipeg in the
central province of Manitoba set up a blockade, closing a main
highway.
   In Ontario province, Ojibway Indians slowed traffic on the
Trans-Canada Highway near Georgian Bay.
   Since the shootout, Mohawks at the Kahnawake reservation have
been demonstrating their sympathy by blocking a bridge between
Montreal and its southern suburbs.
   Local residents have vented their anger at the bridge blockade
with protests and racist slurs. On Tuesday, the residents broke
through police barriers there but stopped when confronted by 100
officers standing shoulder-to-shoulder. No injuries were reported.

   Explosions ripped through a chemical plant
Thursday, killing one person, injuring as many as 63 others and
shattering windows in houses and businesses up to a quarter-mile
away, authorities said.
   The two explosions ignited a fire that took 2{ hours to contain
enough so that firefighters could enter the four-story brick
building.
   The blast sent fireballs 50 feet into the sky. A column of
thick, black smoke poured from the building into the surrounding
residential neighborhood. Some of the injured were cut by shattered
glass at a supermarket.
   Fire Chief Bill Miller said the plant had accounted for all its
employees. He said up to 63 people were injured. Area hospitals
said they were treating 56 people; four were critically injured.
   About 1,000 people were evacuated from houses in the neighboring
incorporated area of Norwood for the night while authorities
checked for structural damage, said Norwood safety director Darryll
Maxwell. He said six homes had been declared uninhabitable.
   Air tests performed by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
around the plant found no toxic gases in the smoke, Miller said.
   About 200 people work at the BASF Corp. plant, which makes
linings for cans and coatings for paper cups. The building
contained about 50 chemicals, including explosive solvents and
varnishes, workers at the scene said.
   Volatile and explosive solvents may have leaked from a mixing
vat and been ignited by a spark, said Malcolm Adcock, an assistant
health commissioner. But he stressed this was merely a hypothesis.
   Kenneth D. Diedenhofer, a BASF production manager, said the
company was investigating the possibility of a ``pressure buildup''
of chemicals in equipment that was being cleaned.
   Dan Delaney, who works near the plant, said he saw a huge ball
of fire and smoke out his office window.
   ``Shortly thereafter, everybody was running down the street, out
of the building to get out, sort of in a panic, just getting out of
there as fast as they could,'' Delaney said.
   ``Police and firemen are all around, fighting the blaze,'' he
said. ``They just keep getting small explosions and more fireballs
shooting up in the air.''
   Ken Kinderman, 29, a materials handler at the factory, said he
was walking out of a locker room in an adjacent building when the
explosion occurred.
   ``I opened the door and when the explosion hit, it threw me back
through the locker room,'' Kinderman said. He said he had cuts on
his back and arms, but was not seriously injured.
   Kinderman said the building where the explosion occurred was
used for handling solvents and varnishes.
   ``I saw the flames shoot from the other building into mine. The
whole back of my building is gone,'' Kinderman said.
   Windows also were shattered at some houses three blocks away.
   Whalen identified the dead man as Lawrence H. Krechting, 58, an
employee at the plant.
   Most of the injured, including an 8-year-old boy, sustained
minor injuries, hospital officials said.
   Four people were in critical condition at the University of
Cincinnati Hospital, said spokesman David Bracey.
   Diedenhofer said he was in a lab next door when the explosion
occurred about 2:15 p.m.
   ``It blew out all the windows. The whole resin building was
engulfed in flames,'' Diedenhofer said.
   ``I couldn't get in to help anyone. I saw one person hanging on
to the building. I was able to get him off.''
   Windows in homes and storefronts as much as a quarter mile from
the plant were blown out.
   The second blast occurred about 2:50 p.m., and it was that blast
that did most of the apparent damage, Diedenhofer said.
   Diedenhofer said about 200 people work at the plant, which makes
linings for cans.
   Dan Lawrence, a student at Summit Country Day School more than a
mile from the blast site, said he was working at the school when
the blast shook his building.
   Lawrence said he thought an earthquake had struck.

<HEAD>International Bar Association Scraps Nairobi as Convention Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Bar Association announced
Thursday it has canceled plans to hold its annual convention in
Nairobi, Kenya, because it cannot guarantee delegates' safety.
   Executive Director Madeleine May said the association was also
concerned ``about the state of human rights and the rule of law in
Kenya'' following civil disturbances this month.
   The convention will instead be held in New York City Sept.
19-23, she said.
   ``Safety of delegates is paramount and following three days of
serious unrest in Nairobi and other central areas from 7-9 July
1990, which left some 25 dead and many more injured, I and my
fellow officers feel that such safety cannot be guaranteed,'' Ms.
May said in a letter to more than 1,000 delegates.
   ``Everywhere is now peaceful but we cannot be sure this will be
the case in September.
   ``Another matter of great concern to us is the state of human
rights and the rule of law in Kenya. A number of persons are
detained without being charged, including four lawyers, at least
one of whom was arrested when he went to a police station to
interview his client.''
   The letter continued, ``Many hold the view that by proceeding
with our conference the IBA would be lending support to a regime
that has suppressed those attempting peacefully to express their
political views and exercise their internationally recognized human
rights.''
   The association, founded in 1947 and now with more than 13,000
members, describes itself as the largest international forum for
lawyers.
   The human rights organization Africa Watch issued a news release
in New York, its headquarters, saying it ``applauds the decision''
of the association.
   Africa Watch, a division of the private Human Rights Watch that
monitors abuses around the world, said ``the arrest, exile and
harassment of human rights lawyers makes Kenya a singularly
inappropriate venue for a meeting'' of such an organization as the
International Bar Association.

<HEAD>Spanish-Language News Teams Left Out Of Quayle Interview Coverage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spanish-language television stations excluded
from interviews Thursday in which Vice President Dan Quayle
discussed a job bias bill attacked the action as insensitive and
demanded explanations.
   ``I just don't understand the reason. If they don't want to deal
with the Hispanics, then that's pretty stupid,'' said Angelica
Figueroa, news producer at KVDA, an affiliate of the
Spanish-language network Telemundo.
   ``The irony of the thing is he was talking here about a
discrimination bill passed by the Senate,'' said KWEX News Director
Ed Barrera, whose station is an affiliate of the Spanish-language
Univision network, Telemundo's competitor.
   A spokesman for Quayle, who in the interviews discussed his
opposition to a bias bill passed in the Senate Wednesday night,
said no station was intentionally left out.
   Affiliates of ABC, CBS and NBC were invited to interview Quayle
at a San Antonio hotel Thursday morning after he spoke with
newspaper and radio reporters.
   Two cameras were allowed to tape the interview and were asked to
share the videotape with others who were present, said reporters
who attended. A reporter from the Mexican network ECO also was
allowed in after protesting his exclusion, reporters said.
   Barrera said his station had asked before Quayle's visit about
covering the event and was not told of the Thursday interviews. He
later learned there was a press pool only for the three
English-language networks, and called Quayle's press office to
complain.
   ``Some guy said, `That's the way we do it,' and that was it,''
Barrera said. ``I think it's discrimination.''
   A Quayle spokesman who spoke on condition he not be identified
said the interview was not open to all news organizations and that
a limited number of local stations routinely are invited to
interview Quayle when he travels.
   Ms. Figueroa said she wouldn't call the action discrimination,
but said it was ``very insensitive,'' especially in a city of 1
million people where more than 50 percent are Hispanic.
   ``If they're trying to pick up the vice president's image, it
was a very dumb thing to do,'' she said.
   She and Barrera said that even though Quayle doesn't answer
questions in Spanish, they wanted videotape of him and to be in on
the interviews.
   Quayle's spokesman said that when KWEX asked about press
coverage of Quayle, the station was told only the vice president's
arrival and departure would be open to all news media. He said KWEX
covered Quayle's arrival, and was invited to cover the vice
president's motorcade.
   ``The bottom line here is somebody's trying to make something
out of nothing,'' he said. ``We can't include everybody.''
   Texas Republican Pary Chairman Fred Meyer said Barrera called
him to complain. Meyer then called Quayle's office.
   ``We, as a Republican Party, are interested in all the media,''
Meyer said. ``I'm sure that the vice president would not want to
overlook these kinds of things, and none of us as Republicans do.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: Police Officer Used Hot Iron to Torture Drug Suspect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report that a police officer tortured a
drug suspect with a hot iron during questioning has prompted calls
from the NAACP and other community groups Thursday for the police
chief to resign.
   The groups urged the U.S. Justice Department to investigate the
incident, which is already being investigated by the police
department's Internal Affairs Bureau.
   The Dayton Daily News, citing police investigative records,
reported Wednesday that officer John Gamble last January used the
iron to scorch David Greer three or four times while another
officer pinned Greer face-up to a mattress.
   Gamble kept asking the 18-year-old a question until Greer told
him what he wanted to know after Gamble threatened to burn his
genitals, the newspaper said.
   Greer later pleaded guilty to aggravated drug trafficking, and
was sentenced to three to 15 years in prison.
   Both Greer and Gamble are black.
   Gamble denied burning Greer until two other officers
acknowledged June 7 that it had taken place, the Daily News said.
Gamble made a tape-recorded statement to police July 6.
   ``I did it,'' the newspaper quoted Gamble as saying. ``I'm not
proud of it. It happened. There's nothing I can do about it now. I
wish it didn't, but it did, and it's time for me to deal with it.''
   Montgomery County Prosecutor Lee Falke announced he had
appointed a special prosecutor to determine whether criminal
charges were warranted.
   The Daily News story triggered calls Thursday for the
resignation of Police Chief James Newby by local chapters of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Urban League, as
well as the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance.
   ``We are outraged and disappointed, but not surprised at this
latest incident of police brutality and the subsequent attempt to
cover up this brutal act,'' said NAACP chapter President Jessie
Gooding. ``This highlights the pattern of ongoing police brutality
and injustice in the Dayton Police Department.''
   The Rev. William T. Head, an investigator for the NAACP, said
Newby is responsible for his officers' actions.
   ``Finally, the community has knowledge that the police are not
above lying and are not above committing illegal acts,'' said Head.
``It's time for Chief Newby to step aside.''
   Head, who has led efforts to investigate other alleged instances
of police brutality, said the officer's race was irrelevant.
   ``He's a policeman,'' Head said. ``He's wrong.''
   Newby declined to comment on the call for his resignation.
   ``There was no coverup,'' he said, pointing out that the
investigation was initiated by the police department and that the
information reported by the newspaper was uncovered by police
investigators.
   Newby said that when he first learned of the allegations, his
reaction was ``somewhere between (being) sick to my stomach (and)
disgust.'' He said he expects to announce some disciplinary action
Friday.
   County Prosecutor Falke said prosecutors first became aware of
the allegations against Gamble last March, but were skeptical and
decided to wait until the police department completed its
investigation.
   ``My assistant just couldn't believe it,'' Falke said.

<TEXT>
   Former President Daniel Ortega said
Thursday the fight wasn't over and more unrest could result if the
conservative government doesn't stick to accords reached last week
after a violent Sandinista strike.
   Ortega spoke at a rally celebrating the 11th anniversary of the
popular insurrection that ended the 45-year Somoza family
dictatorship.
   ``The struggle had not concluded,'' he told thousands of people
at a plaza.
   ``We were able to defend that conquest of the revolution, but
the struggle has not ended ... with the accord between the
government and the workers; (or) with those who have extremist
positions, who want to disavow the accords.''
   Ortega was refering to the firing of more than 100 Managua
municipal workers after the strike ended July 11.
   Broad concessions won by the the strikers included a promise by
the government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro not to fire
those taking part in the walkout.
   Clashes during the strike between heavily armed Sandinistas and
government supporters killed at least six people and wounded more
than 100.
   Ortega warned government officials to ``proceed with caution
because they are provoking more conflicts.''
   ``Now we have to defend democracy against those who want to
return to Somocism,'' he said, adding that extremists within the
government ``want to see our heads rolls, but if any heads roll it
will be theirs.''
   The Chamorro government, which ended a decade of Sandinista rule
April 25, declared Thursday a national holiday but did not hold
public celebrations.
   Mrs. Chamorro accused the Sandinistas of trying to restore a
dictatorship. She said in a televised speech Wednesday night that
all Nicaraguans had supported the revolution of July 19, 1979,
because ``we all believed that we were breaking the gate of a
tyranny to enter the promised land of democracy and freedom ...
   ``Unfortunately the revolution was confiscated by an exclusive
party with a totalitarian ideology it had kept hidden. Instead of
democracy, dictatorship rose again like a cadaver.''
   Sandinista supporters shooting machine guns and other weapons
into the air cruised Managua streets at dawn Thursday to kick off
the festivities, and shouted the newest Sandinista slogan: ``The
revolution continues; not one step back!''
   In an apparent attempt to draw people away from the Sandinista
rally, Nicaragua's only TV station, government-run Channel 6,
scheduled back-to-back movies all day, including ``Batman,'' ``The
Fly'' and ``Crocodile Dundee.''
   But neither movies nor rain kept away the crowds, estimated by
reporters at about 40,000, half the attendance projected by
Sandinista officials.
   Last year's July 19th Sandinista rally drew about 100,000
people, but many were government workers compelled to attend or
risk losing their job.
   Mrs. Chamorro said ``bad Nicaraguans'' want this July 19 ``not
to signify democracy, but military dictatorship again,'' and asked
the people to support her.
   ``I want to teach those who only know violence the benefits of
respecting (legal) rights and of brotherly love.''
   Managua residents awakened to the sounds of fire from machine
guns, pistols and AK-47s in nearly every neighborhood.
   The noise smacked of the day 11 years ago when Sandinista
leaders and others who fought dictator Anastasio Somoza rode
triumphant into Managua to celebrate the secret flight two days
earlier of the last of the Somozas.
   Chamorro supporters say the president should have taken a
tougher stance with the strikers, and Mrs. Chamorro alluded to that
in her speech.
   ``It is difficult to educate those who have been fanaticized by
violence and terror,'' she said. ``We carry an inheritance of
barbarian aggression that almost destroyed Managua in a few hours.
   ``But we must prove to them the value of peace and the
well-being that freedom brings and the greatness we can achieve
working together as brothers.''
   Mrs. Chamorro was on the original five-member Sandinista junta.
She is the most prominent of those Nicaraguans who backed the
Sandinistas in their early years but became disenchanted.

<HEAD>Visit of Two Presidents to End Waldheim Isolation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidents Richard von Weizsaecker of
West Germany and Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia will meet Kurt
Waldheim July 26, ending four years of near-isolation for Austria's
head of state, officials said Wednesday.
   Waldheim has been barred from entering the United States and
largely shunned by world diplomats for concealing his wartime
service in Yugoslavia and Greece as an intelligence officer with
the invading army of Nazi Germany.
   The Czechoslovak Charter 77 human rights movement, which was
instrumental in strengthening the opposition and toppling Communist
rule in Czechoslovakia last year, called on Havel to cancel his
visit to Austria and avoid meeting Waldheim, the Czechoslovak state
news agency CTK reported.
   In an open letter addressed to Havel, Charter 77 representatives
said that by snubbing Waldheim, ``the international community voted
for truth and ethics, i.e. for those political principles on which
Vaclav Havel based his mandate.''
   The letter asked Havel, a co-founder of the dissident movement
established in 1977, to publish the reasons that led him to make
``such a serious step or to reconsider his visit,'' CTK said.
   President Georgios Vassiliou of Cyprus met Waldheim in early
July, the only Western head of state up to now to officially visit
the Austrian president.
   Weizsaecker and Havel will see Waldheim, the former
secretary-general of the United Nations, at the opening of the
annual Salzburg Festival, Waldheim spokesman Kurt Skalnik said.
   Havel's arrival had been in doubt. The Prague daily Lidove
Noviny said Wednesday that Havel would not make the trip, but CTK
quoted Havel's press spokesman as saying the president would visit
Salzburg on the agreed date.
   In a report issued in February 1987, a world commission of
historians did not find that Waldheim was implicated in World War
II crimes, but said he must have known about wartime atrocities
committed by his unit.
   Waldheim denies any wrongdoing. He says charges directed against
him by the World Jewish Congress and other international critics
were aimed at keeping him from being elected president, and after
that failed, at forcing him to resign.

   The $6.6 billion Seabrook nuclear power
plant went to full power Thursday for the first time in the 22-year
history of the project, a major battleground in the fight over
nuclear power.
   The reactor reached 1,150 megawatts, enough power for 1 million
homes, at 9:52 p.m., according to plant spokesman Ron Sher.
   ``Reaching full power fulfills the dream we have all worked so
hard to achieve,'' said Edward Brown, president of New Hampshire
Yankee, the plant's operator.
   For plant opponents, the milestone was the latest in a rapid
series of disappointments since the decade-late plant received its
commercial operating license in March from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
   ``What they're doing now is another step in the long process of
the abuse of power,'' said Roy Morrison, spokesman for the
anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance. ``It's a complete disregard of the
public safety. The plant is unsafe. It's operating in a place where
there is no evacuation possible.''
   The group will distribute leaflets at nearby Hampton Beach on
Sunday, but no other protests were planned, said another Clamshell
spokesman, Sam Miller.
   More than 3,200 people have been arrested in anti-Seabrook
protests that began even before ground was broken for the project
in 1976.
   Hampton Beach, a focus for Seabrook foes who argue there is no
way to safely evacuate the area, was crowded with beachgoers
Thursday as temperatures climbed into the 90s.
   Tom McDermott, 28, of Lowell, Mass., said he felt plant
operators had ``everything pretty much under control or they
wouldn't be going up to full power. I guess I'm just relying on
them to take care of it, to let us know if something's wrong.''
   Gloria Flanders is a Hampton Beach regular from Amesbury, one of
six Massachusetts towns within Seabrook's 10-mile emergency zone.
She said she comes to the shore on weekdays, but will avoid it on
weekends, when crowds are bigger.
   ``A lot of people are paranoid,'' she said. ``I'm not paranoid.
I'm just uncomfortable.''
   Cliff Moss, co-owner of the New Yorker Bed &amp; Breakfast, is
neither. An inspector at Niagara Mohawk's nuclear plant in Oswego,
N.Y., for six years, Moss said he has confidence in Seabrook's
safety systems.
   So does Jack O'Brien, whose gas station is practically in the
plant's back yard.
   ``Seabrook has been scrutinized under the biggest microscopes
for years,'' he said. Full power ``should've happened eight years
ago.''
   Public Service Co. shelved a nuclear plant proposal in 1969, but
three years later proposed Seabrook as a twin-reactor plant with a
cost of less than $1 billion. Construction delays and cost
increases forced owners to scrap Seabrook 2 in the mid-1980s, and
pushed lead owner Public Service into bankruptcy reorganization in
1988.
   As New Hampshire's governor during the 1980s, White House Chief
of Staff John Sununu played a major role in keeping the project
alive.
   Under the plant's emergency plans, a summertime peak population
of 247,000 would be moved out of the 10-mile emergency zone in an
accident.
   Critics say that's impossible without an unacceptably high risk
of exposure to radiation. Plant supporters and the NRC disagree.
   One of the chief opponents is Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis. Massachusetts has refused to take part in emergency
planning for its six communities in the emergency zone. Two of the
17 New Hampshire communities involved, Kensington and Rye, also are
not participating.

   Three construction workers died under
several feet of dirt Wednesday when a pit caved in, authorities
said.
   The workers were in a hole dug to accommodate a concrete pipe,
said Jones County Civil Defense spokesman Don McKinnon.
   McKinnon, who was one of the first people to reach the cave-in
described a chain-reaction disaster that left the men buried under
15 feet to 20 feet of dirt.
   ``A mound of dirt had fell and pinned the legs of one of the
men,'' McKinnon said. ``The other two ran over to help him and they
about had him free when it all caved in.''

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo called on Friday
for an end to Cold War on the Korean peninsula and proposed
unrestricted travel between communist North Korea and South Korea.
   ``The time has come to end total division,'' Roh said in a major
nationwide radio and television broadcast. ``Korea must not remain
the world's only land still partitioned by Cold War politics.''
   There was no immediate reaction from North Korea. Acceptance by
North Korea would open the peninsula for the first time since 1945
and set the stage for national unification.
   Roh noted in the speech that President Kim Il Sung of North
Korea proposed conditional free travel on Jan. 1, and said, ``I am
convinced there will be no obstacle.''
   Roh said South Korea would open its border at Panmunjom in the
Demilitarized Zone for five days as of Aug. 13 and ``accept
breathren from the North without restrictions.''
   Roh said North Koreans would be allowed to freely visit any
place in the South and meet anyone they want. He challenged North
Korea to offer the same provisions to South Koreans.
   He said that ``in the near future'' foreigners would be
permitted to freely travel across the border, a move which might
allow tourists and could be expected to speed up the easing of
tensions between the Koreas.
   ``A tide of openness and reconciliation has torn away the Iron
Curtain separating the East and the West and is now shaping a new
world in which nations are cooperating with each other regardless
of differences in ideology and political systems,'' he said.
   ``Even if North Korea cannot agree to mutual exchanges at this
time for some unavoidable reason, we will one-sidely open our
society competely,'' Roh declared.
   South Koreans reacted by welcoming the president's announcement.
But many doubted totalitarian North Korea, one of the last
remaining closed societies, would allow its citizens to visit the
South.
   The United National Movement for Democracy, South Korea's
largest dissident group, called the border proposal ``a step
forward.'' It also demanded the immediate release of political
prisoners in South Korea, including a student and pastor jailed for
travel to North Korea.
   Roh's Cabinet will meet Saturday to review proceedures for
allowing travel to take place. South Korean law now makes it a
violation of national security to visit North Korea without
government permission, which has been rarely given.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into communist North and
capitalist South in 1945 at the end of World War II. The two fought
a bitter three-year civil and ideological war in the early 1950s
and have remained hostile.
   ``The fact that compatriots in the South and North are still
unable to visit each other is a shame on us who are a proud people
with a rich cultural heritage that has evolved over many
millenniums. Such a state of affairs should not continue any
longer,'' he said.
   Both North and South Korea have talked about free travel, but
have never negotiated it. The border has remained tightly closed to
virtually all travel, mail and telephone communication for more
than four decades.
   Two weeks ago, North Korea announced it would open a portion of
its border for restricted passage within a small border area
beginning Aug. 15.
   The Korean peninsula was freed from 35 years of Japanese
colonial rule on Aug. 15, 1945, and the day is historically
symbolic to both Koreas.
   The proposal by both Koreas calls for the border to be opened at
Panmunjom, the truce village in the Demilitarized Zone that divides
the peninsula in half. Panmunjom, about 35 miles north of Seoul, is
the site of periodic North-South talks.
   Panmunjom is inaccessible to the average Korean citizen from
either side. The border between the Koreas is the most heavily
fortified in the world with more than 1 million armed soldiers
behind concrete bunkers and barbed wire.
   The southern half of the Panmunjom area is guarded by the
U.S.-led United Nations Command. The command has said that it would
honor the wishes of the Koreans regarding a border opening.
   In 1985, the Koreas exchanged 151 citizens from both sides for a
four-day family exchange but the visits were limited to the
capitals of the two nations.
   The two Koreas are to sign an agreement July 26 setting a date
for their first prime ministers' talks expected to be held in Seoul
in September.
   ``Consider how magnificent and great an age the 21st century
could be for our people if only the country is unified and the 70
million Korans become one again,'' the president said.
   South Korea has about 43 million residents, while North Korea
has a population of about 22 million people.

<HEAD>Dunkirk Veterans Turn Out for Queen, Heat Takes Toll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALDERSHOT, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterans of the Dunkirk evacuation in
World War II marked its 50th anniversary on Wednesday with a parade
before Queen Elizabeth II, but the heat took its toll.
   One woman fainted while sitting in the reviewing stand near the
queen and was taken away by stretcher. The parade was held in the
garrison town of Aldershot, 35 miles southwest of London.
   First-aid was given to about 25 people affected by the 88-degree
temperatures.
   ``Some of them thought they were back in the desert again,''
said Maj. Gen. John Carpenter, chairman of the Dunkirk Veterans
Association.
   Some of those on parade also fought in the desert campaign in
which British and U.S. armies drove German and Italian forces from
North Africa.
   ``To all of you the country owes a great debt of gratitude,''
the queen told the 2,000 parading veterans, some in wheelchairs
pushed by young paratroopers.
   The main anniversary celebrations were held in late May,
climaxing with a ragtag flotilla of 50 vessels making their way
across the English Channel from the French port of Dunkirk to
Ramsgate, England.
   Over 10 days in May and June 1940, British, Dutch, French and
Belgian warships and civilian craft evacuated 338,000 British,
French and Belgian troops from Dunkirk, which was surrounded after
the Germans broke through across northern France.
   Those saved amid the bombs and gunfire helped form the nucleus
of the victorious allied armies which invaded Normandy in June 1944.
   For morale purposes, Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill
ordered the Dunkirk defeat to be announced as a deliverance and it
has since been regarded in Britain as something of a miracle.
   The queen and her husband Prince Philip later met some veterans
after the parade.
   ``What are you all standing around here for? The bar's open,''
said Philip, gesturing toward a drinks tent.

   Moslem fundamentalists stabbed a policeman
to death on Wednesday in southern Assiut province, the Middle East
News Agency said.
   One suspect was arrested and police were searching for others
who fled, the state-run news agency quoted the province's security
chief, Maj. Gen. Mahmoud el-Fakhrany, as saying.
   The policeman was attacked with knives and swords in Deirout,
about 190 miles south of Cairo.
   Last Friday, two Moslem extremists were killed and nine wounded
in a clash with police in Deirout. Five police were also wounded.
   Police sources said the clash followed an attack on a wedding
party by Moslem fundamentalists who were protesting the presence of
a belly dancer and band. The fundamentalists view such activities
as violations of Islamic teachings.
   Moslem fundmentalists demand the immediate application of
Islamic law in Egypt. They have been involved in numerous violent
incidents in the past few years, mostly in Cairo and southern Egypt.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-three gray whales that washed up on the
Trinity Islands in the Gulf of Alaska recently probably died of
natural causes, federal officials said.
   The National Marine Fisheries Service decision against taking
tissue samples for tests drew fire from some environmentalists.
Critics said the endangered mammals should be tested to see if they
ingested oil from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in nearby Prince
William Sound.
   ``We have no reason to think at this point that it's anything
other than natural mortality,'' Steve Zimmerman of the fisheries
service said Tuesday from Juneau.
   He noted the whales had migrated several thousand miles from
their feeding area in the Bering Sea to the Mexican coast last
fall, then returned.
   ``Any that are physiologically weak are going to have problems
toward the end of that long migration,'' he said.
   He said the number of fatalities was high, but the whales could
have died of old age, parasites, genetic defects, marginal feeding
and exhaustion, among other possibilities.
   Environmentalists have expressed concern because gray whales
feed on the ocean's bottom, where weathered oil would sink and
accumulate in sediments.
   ``Grays are the first ones to get nailed if there are tar balls
on the bottom,'' said Cindy Lowry, Alaska director of Greenpeace.
   ``I'm going to encourage them to take not only tissue samples
but stomach samples as well. This is an endangered species _ they
should be taking it seriously. That's too many whales dying in the
same place.''
   Biologists from the fisheries service and the University of
Alaska Fairbanks examined 14 of the whales Sunday and Monday on
Tugidak Island, about 350 miles south of Anchorage.
   Of the 14 whales on Tugidak, one apparently was the victim of a
killer whale, they said. Two apparently had been dead since last
year, and one of the 14 was a calf or yearling.

<TEXT>
   A university professor who questioned the
existence of Nazi gas chambers in a magazine article lost a
disciplinary hearing Wednesday and was suspended from his job for
one year.
   Bernard Notin will draw only half-salary during his suspension
as an economics and law instructor at Jean Moulin University-Lyon
III, the university's disciplinary committee ruled.
   Notin is a leading member of Jean-Marie Le Pen's far-right
National Front party, which favors expelling immigrants from
France. Le Pen once called the Holocaust a ``detail'' of history.
   ``This punishment for my ideas, that they've purposely turned
into caricatures while forgetting about my years of teaching and
research, can only leave a bitter taste in the mouths of free
men,'' Notin said, following the committee's ruling.
   He then asked his fellow citizens to show tolerance toward him.
   The decision comes a week after an anti-racism group won an
award of 20,000 francs, or $3,623, as damages against Notin in a
civil complaint based on the same magazine piece.
   The article Notin wrote for the review Economy and Society in
January created a national uproar that led to a clash between the
university and Mayor Michel Noir, who is bitterly opposed to the
National Front.
   The mayor threatened to cancel the city's plans to donate a
building to the university, named for a leader of the Resistance,
unless Notin was fired.
   The university initially said Notin's opinions were protected by
academic freedom but eventually set in course the process leading
to the disciplinary hearing.
   ``The mayor of Lyon has already given the verdict in advance,''
Notin said as the hearing began Tuesday. ``He has the money, he
buys universities. I don't have anything to stand up to that.''
   Notin's lawyer, Gilbert Collard, said he would appeal the
verdict and ask that a new hearing be held outside Lyon.
   Notin's article said that visiting concentration camps is a
``hardly credible'' way to prove the gas chambers existed, and
described accounts by Holocaust survivors as ``hearsay.''
   It outraged Jewish leaders, students and Holocaust survivors. In
March, 60 people took over Notin's classroom and conducted a lesson
on Hitler's extermination program.
   Fears of an outbreak of anti-Semitism peaked in May after the
desecration of a Jewish cemetery at Carpentras, where a recently
buried corpse was dug up.
   No one has accused Notin of spreading his ideas in the
classroom. But the article was signed by Notin and listed his title
as a professor at the university.
   Though his suspension will last only one year, university
faculty members say privately it is unlikely Notin will be allowed
to return. Under French law, it is a crime punishable by fine to
claim that the Holocaust never existed.

   An advisory committee told the federal government
it should tighten the standard for safe levels of lead in blood.
   New research shows that even low levels of lead in the blood
contribute to childhood learning disabilities and high school
dropout rates, the 14-member committee told the Atlanta-based
Centers for Disease Control on Tuesday.
   Currently the CDC's standard calls for medical intervention and
environmental controls when someone's blood contains 25 or more
micrograms per deciliter.
   The committee recommended continuing the standard for medical
intervention, but said environmental controls should be considered
whenever screening shows a level of 10 micrograms per deciliter in
children, said Dr. Paul Mushak, a professor of environmental
pathology at the University of North Carolina.

   A bomb exploded Wednesday in front of a

extensive damage, officials said.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, but
authorities blame drug traffickers for a long series of bombings
and assassinations in Colombia.
   The bomb was placed in a push cart carrying mangos outside a
municipal building that houses the mayor's office and police
station, Colombian Red Cross official Arturo Arenas told the RCN

   Drug traffickers are engaged in an all-out war against Medellin
policemen. So far this year, they have been blamed for killing more
than 150 law officers in the Medellin area.
   They are also blamed for five car bombs that have exploded in
the city this year, killing at least 60 people.

<HEAD>Fashion Editor Madge Garland Dies at 92</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lady Ashton, better known as Madge Garland, who
was fashion editor of English Vogue in the 1930s and founded the
Royal College of Art's Fashion School, has died, according to news
reports Wednesday. She was 92.
   She had been cared for at a London convent in recent years and
died Sunday, The Times of London reported. It gave no cause of
death and funeral details were not announced.
   She was born Madge McHarg on June 12, 1898, in Melbourne,
Australia, where her father was in business. She grew up in London
and became a journalist in the 1920s, first working for English
Vogue with novelist Aldous Huxley and photographer Cecil Beaton,
and later free-lancing for Women's Wear Daily in the United States.
   Her friends included the couturier Paul Poiret and the sculptor
Brancusi. She chose clothes for Virginia Woolf. Artists Marie
Laurencin and Edward Wolfe painted her and she was one of Beaton's
earliest subjects.
   She returned to English Vogue as fashion editor from 1933,
bringing readers the best of Paris fashion until World War II.
   She became merchandising manager for London's main department
store, Bourne and Hollingsworth, during the war and designed some
fashion. After the war, she visited the United States to study
ready-to-wear marketing methods for the British fashion industry.
   In 1947, Sir Robin Darwin of the Royal College of Art invited
her to found the first British school of fashion. As Professor
Garland, she opened the school the following year and remained at
its head until 1956. Designers David Sassoon and Gina Fratini were
among her students.
   During the 1960s, she produced five books on fashion, beauty and
the history of costumes.
   She was married briefly in the 1920s to Capt. Ewart Garland. In
1953, she married Sir Leigh Ashton, then director of Victoria and
Albert Museum. The marriage lasted less than a year although they
were not divorced until 1962. She retained the name Lady Ashton for
formal purposes.
   She had no children.

   The earthquake that struck the main

government ill-prepared for disaster and dramatized her
administration's organizational shortcomings.
   Three days after the quake, which measured 7.7 on the Richter
scale, the government has no comprehensive picture of the extent of
damage and casualties.
   Relief operations appear centered in areas such as Baguio, where
media focused its attention.
   ``The immediate task is the rescue and feeding of survivors,''
said the newspaper Malaya. ``Three days after the earthquake, the

   Moscow's decision to drop its objection to
NATO membership for a reunited Germany likely will put East-West
arms control negotiations back on track, administration officials
and private arms control experts say.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters Wednesday that
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's concession on German
participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ``removed
the last roadblock'' to clinching two landmark arms control
agreements.
   Cheney referred to 23-nation negotiations to sharply reduce the
number of conventional arms _ tanks, troops and aircraft _ in
Europe, and to U.S.-Soviet talks on slashing strategic, or
long-range, nuclear missiles by one-third.
   The conventional arms negotiations have been bogged down for
months by several key disputes, including NATO resistance to a
Soviet demand that the West German government of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl accept a numerical limit on its armed forces.

   If you were to telephone West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as President Bush did the other day, it
would cost between $6.20 and $11.58 for 10 minutes, depending on
how and when you called.
   But if someone called you from West Germany, it would cost them
$19.07 for the same call, regardless of how or when.
   That may sound as though you're getting a good deal. But you
aren't.
   The Federal Communications Commission says that due to outmoded
international telephone pricing agreements between U.S. companies
and their overseas counterparts, you may be paying twice what it
actually costs to place such calls.

<HEAD>HBO's ``El Diablo'' A Shaggy Western Story</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billy Ray, the dude schoolteacher, is reading to
his class from a penny dreadful about the Old West, ``Kid Durango:
The Dust Devils.'' The Kid, of course, is brave, strong and quick
with a gun.
   One of his students, the fair Nettie, sighs at the part about a
terrible band of outlaws from Mexico. Just then, such a band
gallops into her dusty Texas town for purposes of robbing a bank
and killing people.
   The fair Nettie dashes outside to see all this. El Diablo, the
gang's handsome, ruthless leader, rides up and kidnaps her, even
though she's only oh, maybe 17. Billy Ray, although from Boston,
vows to rescue her.
   This, buckaroos, starts Home Box Office's ``El Diablo,'' a
shaggy Western tale arriving Sunday on the pay-cable service.
   It co-stars Anthony Edwards as the dude schoolteacher who
believes the Old West cliches, and Lou Gossett as an ex-sergeant
from the Army's black cavalry. The latter now is a gunfighter hired
to help save Nettie.
   Representing Old West reality, he sort of instructs the dude in
how ride a horse _ he lets the horse drag Billy Ray when he falls
off _ and how to shoot and hit something, such as another man with
a gun.
   Gunnery protocol, he says, includes looking at an opponent's gun
hand, not his eyes, and shooting opponents in the back whenever
possible.
   With a script by a trio that includes John Carpenter of
``Halloween'' and ``The Fog'' fame, such assault on Western
verities should be pretty funny. Well, at times the script is.
   Its early moments include an old codger who smiles at Billy Ray
and the fair Nettie (Sarah Trigger) as they head to school, then
cheerily says, ``Beautiful mornin' for procreation.''
   There also is a scruffy townie who, after El Diablo rides off
with fair Nettie, recalls seeing him hanged once, but ``he wouldn't
die. He just hanged there by his neck, spittin' at the crowd like
they disgusted him.''
   There is a lot to be said for such lines, likewise the lowlife
posse gunfighter Gossett digs up _ a man with a store leg, an
Indian with whose wife El Diablo has consorted, and a preacher who
holds fake hangings with two colleagues in return for donations.
   All have varied motives for joining the chase. They're later
joined by Truman Feathers (Joe Pantoliano), a dusty, but prissy
British author of the ``Kid Durango'' series.
   Upon meeting Billy Ray, now clad in gun and wooly chaps, the
writer is moved to say: ``I love your outfit.''
   Problem is, the ``El Diablo'' script is in dire need of editing.
When the funny lines and situations arise, and there are quite a
few, the authors stretch things out. This tends to fritter away the
funny.
   They also don't seem to realize that shock for comic effect
should be sparingly used, as when the dude accidentally shoots and
kills his horse while trying to ride out of town. Sure enough, it
happens again later.
   And while the show is beautifully photographed, director Peter
Markle usually moves things along at a snail's pace, a mortal sin
for an Old West show.
   The pace does pick up as the posse approaches and enters Mexico,
where El Diablo is keeping both his stolen gold and the fair Nettie
in a town ringed by mountains. Guns go off and bodies fall all over
the place.
   But even with the preceding moments of doom, it takes a while
for the show to get moving. Markle tends to make the proceedings
going downright leisurely, almost an art-film edition of ``Blazing
Saddles,'' minus the fine bean-dinner scene and its ensuing blasts
of hot air.
   Still, ``El Diablo,'' whose title cad is played by Robert
Beltran, has some good performances by Gossett and Andrews. The
supporting players also do fine work, particularly Pantoliano.
   If you have HBO, the movie is worth a look-see, flaws and all.
But it could and should have been a whole lot funnier.

<HEAD>The Big and The Small of Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest companies seem to make the biggest
news in the stock market, and for obvious reasons: They and their
products are known to the public, and their stocks make up the
popular averages and indices.
   But the biggest companies are not a proxy for the economy as a
whole, as a number of small-business and medium-size business
groups feel compelled to point out from time to time.
   What happens to the biggest names in corporate America can be,
and often is, at variance with what is happening in the rest of the
economy, and evidence of that is contained in the latest dividend
actions.
   Many of the biggest companies have been raising dividends. The
smaller companies have tended to stay put, with relatively few of
them taking positive action, such as resuming dividends, raising
them, and adding extras.
   Observe the contrast:
   In the first half of 1990, cash dividends paid by companies
making up the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 12 percent.
For the 12 months through June, the same companies paid out 56
percent of profits as dividends.
   That latter figure, say researchers at Wright Investors'
Service, compares with just 49 percent for the past decade and 51
percent for the period 1950-1989.
   Figures of that sort suggest a high level of management
confidence among the larger companies, since companies looking for
a downturn aren't likely to commit themselves to larger payouts.
   Now enlarge the measurement to 10,000 companies. Among these
companies, which make up the entire S&amp;P universe, only 868 took
positive dividend action in the first six months of the year, down
25 percent from a year earlier.
   Says Wright: ``This is the lowest number of positive dividend
actions in the first half of any year since 1971, a fact which
illustrates corporate management's lack of confidence regarding the
near-term profit outlook.''
   The contrast with the bigger companies becomes even sharper on
further examination.
   According to Wright, the total of 187 dividend cuts and
omissions in the first half of the year was more than 70 percent
higher than in the first half of 1989, and the highest six-month
total of unfavorable actions since 1983.
   Other studies have shown similar disparities between the
performance and expectations of smaller and larger companies.
   In contrast to a long-term trend, for example, the performance
of small-company stocks has lagged behind that of bigger companies
since 1983, casting much doubt about the veracity of the so-called
small-stock effect.
   Small-company stocks, according to that theory, have a tendency
to outperform larger companies, one factor being that good small
companies have the ability to grow at a faster rate than
ponderously large operations.
   Other factors enter the picture as well: Small-company stocks
are often run by the original entrepreneur, who understands the
company and demands nothing but the best; and, unexamined by
analysts, small-company stocks are more likely to be undervalued,
their prices exploding when they are finally discovered.
   In recent months, some analysts say they are seeing signs of a
recovery by the smaller stocks, but if dividend actions are an
indicator, similar signs are hardly evident among the larger stocks.
   The dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 stock index recently was 3.3
percent, or well below its long-term average yield of 4.2 percent.
Such figures suggest that big-company stocks might be overpriced.

<HEAD>Emirate Debates What to Do About Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALY MAHMOUD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuwaitis are debating how to pursue democracy four
years after the ruling family closed the Western-style parliament
and press.
   Some feel the choice for the emirate, where oil provides one of
the world's highest per capita incomes, is between reviving the old
system and developing an Islamic brand of democracy.
   The government and dissidents have traded accusations of blame
for setbacks to the democratic institutions, but dissident leader
Ahmed al-Saadoun said: ``Our loyalty to our leader, the emir, is
undiminished by our unrelenting struggle for democracy.''
   ``Security authorities have tried to cast an undue tinge of
rebellion on our movement,'' Saadoun, speaker of the dissolved
parliament, said in an interview. ``Riot police ruthlessly
dispersed peaceful rallies, closed our diwaniyas, and arrested
parliament deputies.''
   Diwaniyas are informal gatherings at the homes prominent
citizens to discuss current issues. The government declared the
diwaniyas of former deputies illegal at one point and ordered them
closed.
   Dissidents and witnesses said police used clubs and tear gas to
disperse pro-democracy demonstrators. They said some members of the
former parliament were beaten up and 15 were arrested.
   ``The respected institution of diwaniya has been badly abused,''
Sheik Salem al-Sabah, the interior minister, told reporters. ``The
diwaniya became a platform of diatribe and anti-government
agitation. We had to put an end to that.''
   About 30 of the 50 former deputies, under Saadoun, lead a
pro-democracy movement that has broad support among wealthy
merchants in the Persian Gulf emirate.
   Native Kuwaitis ``are the largest minority in our own country
and, with the population structure being infested with all kinds of
hostile and begrudging elements, we desperately need national unity
today more than ever before,'' said Mohammed al-Qadiri, a close
aide of Saadoun.
   Fewer than 40 percent of the emirate's 1.8 million people are
Kuwaitis. About 30 percent of the residents are Shiite Moslems,
some of whom sympathize with the Islamic revolution in nearby Iran.
   Kuwait once had the Arab world's only free press and freely
elected parliament, both of which were eyed with suspicion by
neighboring Saudi Arabia and other conservative regimes in the gulf
region.
   When the Iran-Iraq war began in 1980, the government decided
democracy was a luxury no Persian Gulf nation could afford.
Pro-Iranian Shiites spread terror in Kuwait with bombings and made
a daring attempt to kill the emir.
   Relations between Kuwait and Iran have improved since a
cease-fire halted the war in 1988, and Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati of Iran visited recently.
   Several times during the war, the press and parliament
embarrassed the government with accusations of corruption and open
debates of subversion and foreign policy.
   Criticism of the government became increasingly harsh after the
unofficial Souk al-Manakh stock market collapsed in 1982. The press
also blamed the government for the crash, which was worthless,
post-dated checks totaling $97 billion.
   Deputies claimed the government had allowed influential people
close to the ruling Sabah family to borrow speculation money from
banks without collateral.
   That prompted the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, to
suspend the National Assembly in 1986 and censor the press.
   ``The emir acted on his constitutional authority when he
dissolved parliament, but the constitutional stipulation that
elections for a new parliament be held within 60 days was
ignored,'' Saadoun said.
   On July 9, Sheik Jaber ordered the detainees freed and
introduced a ``transitional'' legislature dissidents rejected as
unconstitutional. Jaber said the 75-member National Council would
pave the way for a parliament within four years.
   He ordered the council of 50 elected and 25 appointed members to
create ``controls'' to avert the acrimony that precipitated two
suspensions of parliament in a decade.
   Saadoun and other activists expressed fear the government would
amend the constitution to curtail the powers of parliament.
   ``This rape of democracy cannot be tolerated,'' he said. ``All
non-constitutional action, including the current National Council,
must be abolished without delay.''
   The emir has spoken of eventual return to a ``desired
parliament,'' which was widely interpreted as return to a
Western-style body.
   Several activists believe, however, that Jaber might opt for an
Islamic-type Shura consultative council rather than a genuine
legislature, which would please theocratic Saudi Arabia and other
conservative Arab states.

<HEAD>Lebanon Seeks Help to Rescue Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy is in shambles after 15 years
of civil war and President Elias Hrawi has gone on the road,
seeking at least $20 billion in foreign aid to rescue it.
   One safeguard against total economic collapse is Lebanon's gold
reserves of about $3.2 billion, but falling gold prices have cost
the treasury about $500 million in the past 18 months. The national
debt is estimated at $2.3 billion.
   One-third of the bullion is stored at Fort Knox, Ky., and the
rest in underground Central Bank vaults in Moslem west Beirut.
   Foreign currency reserves held by the Central Bank, virtually
the only state institution that still functions, have declined to
$650 million from $1 billion in December. Heavy fighting early this
year drove down the Lebanese pound and the bank sold some reserves
to support the currency.
   Hrawi has been touring Arab capitals in search of financial aid
and a three-member Arab League committee, entrusted with ending the
war, is trying to raise $2 billion for Lebanon.
   Premier Salim Hoss, an economist and former banker, said $2
billion would be barely enough to ``reconstruct the
infrastructure'' of an economy that once was the most flourishing
in the Middle East.
   Lebanese economists estimate reconstruction will cost at least
$21 billion, but many put the figure higher.
   Citizens of Lebanon are believed to have about $30 billion in
assets outside the country. Bankers believe an end to the
Christian-Moslem war, which has cost an estimated 150,000 lives
since 1975, would bring much of it back.
   A settlement remains elusive despite a peace plan, mediated by
the Arab League and endorsed by Lebanon's parliament, and the
election of Hrawi in October to implement it.
   The long war has devastated the Lebanese pound. It was 2.5 to
the dollar 15 years ago, but hit 690 to the dollar in June.
   All the several dozen banks in Beirut speculate on the volatile
Lebanese money market. They buy pounds if they believe things will
improve, even for a short time, and dollars when they expect bad
news.
   Even the Central Bank plays the market. It uses the profits to
finance the budget, because government revenues have virtually
disappeared.
   Revenue from customs levies collapsed when militias took over
ports, operating them illegally, and even built their own ports.
The cost to the treasury is about $200 million a year.
   Prices are soaring in a country that imports at least 85 percent
of its necessities. Precise statistics are rare, but economists and
bankers estimate the annual inflation rate at 400 percent.
   The General Federation of Labor Unions, which represents 250,000
workers, puts unemployment at 47 percent and says most people with
jobs must moonlight to make ends meet.
   Lebanon has no social welfare system, so the unemployed rely on
working relatives, leave the country, resort to crime or join
militias.
   Fierce fighting in the past 18 months between Christians and
Syrians and between rival Christian forces have taken a terrible
economic toll.
   Artillery battles destroyed or damaged hundreds of factories an
shops. A U.N. report in June said fighting between Christians that
began Jan. 30 had caused damage totaling $500 million.
   ``Unprecedented damage to electricity, water and
telecommunications systems has directly affected 1.5 million people
... seriously affecting all social and economic life,'' it said.
   Last month, economist Marwan Iskandar predicted economic and
social catastrophe unless effective action was taken ``in the next
few months.''
   Iskandar, writing in the independent An-Nahar daily, urged the
government to sell its gold reserves and invest the money in
European government bonds to bring in about $350 million a year.
   He said government spending should be limited to that amount and
such state-owned utilities as power plants, water, oil refineries
and communications systems should be sold to private investors.
   Finance Minister Ali Khalil noted that, four years ago, the
parliament forbade the sale of bullion ``because we feared that
replacing gold with foreign currencies would open the door wide to
government spending.''
   Beirut was the Middle East's banking capital before the war,
bustling with Western tycoons and Arab oil sheiks.
   When the Israeli army invaded in 1982, billions of dollars in
Arab assets held in Lebanon fled to Europe. Even now, most of the
several dozen Lebanese banks keep up to 90 percent of their assets
liquid.
   Lebanon's economy has been cushioned by aid from Arab and other
countries, and by large amounts of money given the militias by
foreign backers, including Syria, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Economists estimated there are 80,000 armed irregulars in
Lebanon.
   Another source of invisible income is the trade in opium and
hashish grown in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of east
Lebanon, which earns about $200 million a year for the growers.

<HEAD>South African Communist Joe Slovo: Love Him or Hate Him</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Slovo, lionized by blacks
and vilified by whites, is a lifelong revolutionary who leads one
of the few Communist movements still in ascendancy.
   Slovo the mild-mannered white lawyer was on the African National
Congress team that met with the white National Party government in
talks between South Africa's two most powerful political forces.
   The other Joe Slovo, who angers whites and is an idol to young
blacks, is general secretary of the South African Communist Party
and former head of the ANC guerrilla campaign.
   ``By marking me out as enemy No. 1,'' he said in an interview,
the government ``has endeared me in the hearts of most people in
this country.'' At 64, Slovo looks more like a favorite uncle than
a leader of revolution.
   He is good-humored, engaging and slightly rumpled, with bushy
eyebrows, thick glasses that slide down his nose, a full head of
gray hair and a gravel voice from heavy smoking.
   Slovo fled South Africa in 1963 and returned in April, wearing a
dark blue suit, loud floral tie, cherry red socks and a wide smile.
   ``As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 27 years
ago,'' he said at an airport news conference, ``we are really on
our way.''
   Nelson Mandela said Slovo was the primary African National
Congress speaker on most major issues discussed with the government
in May. Slovo probably will play a similar role in any future
negotiations on ending apartheid.
   However easygoing the exterior, he is a dedicated revolutionary
who became a Communist Party member at age 15. Slovo's parents
immigrated from Lithuania.
   He does not apologize for his years as leader of an ANC bombing
and sabotage campaign that caused hundreds of deaths and injuries,
mostly to blacks.
   His wife and fellow Communist, Ruth First, was killed by a
parcel bomb in neighboring Mozambique in 1982. Slovo says that
South African agents were responsible and that he also has been a
target.
   ``What sustained me was the certainty that I would come back,''
Slovo said of his long exile. ``I never doubted that for one
moment.''
   In 1987, he gave up leadership of the ANC's armed wing to
concentrate on the Communist Party. He remains on the ANC
policy-making body, the National Executive Committee.
   The ANC and South African Communist Party have been allies since
the 1920s, and Slovo is one of several people who holds posts in
both.
   An angry reader wrote in The Citizen, a conservative newspaper:
``He and his ilk have destroyed the peace of South Africa. Red Joe
should never have come back.''
   Former President P.W. Botha cited the government's decision to
allow Slovo's return as one reason he quit the National Party after
more than 50 years.
   At rallies in black townships, chants of ``Viva, Nelson Mandela,
Viva!'' often are followed by cries of ``Viva, Joe Slovo, Viva!''
The red flag of the Communist Party invaribly hangs beside the
green, gold and black of the ANC at such rallies.
   ``South Africa seems to be one of the last places on earth where
the display of the hammer and sickle at public rallies still evokes
cheers,'' Herman Nickel, a former U.S. ambassador to South Africa,
wrote in the Wall Street Journal.
   Many blacks equate apartheid with capitalism and are drawn to
the socialist economics of the Communist Party, but young blacks in
particular have little formal understanding of either system.
   The South African Communist Party was founded in 1921 and banned
in 1950. Secrecy about policies and membership makes its strength
hard to measure, but its key role in the ANC is unquestioned and
the Communists also are considered influential in the trade union
movement.
   President F.W. de Klerk legalized the party in February along
with other anti-apartheid groups. Slovo said he remains convinced
socialism can succeed in South Africa despite the collapse of
Communist governments in Eastern Europe.
   ``Perhaps the reason they changed their names and their
leadership and their policies is because they have a past to be
ashamed of,'' he said of the East European Communists. ``I don't
think we have.''
   Nonetheless, the South African Communists have moderated their
positions after decades of loyalty to the Soviet Union's Communist
Party.
   Slovo calls for a multiparty democracy and says transition from
capitalism to a socialist state would be a long-term process
pursued peacefully.
   Many white South Africans still suspect the worst of the
Communists, however.
   Ken Owen, editor of financial daily Business Day, wrote:
``Behind the smiling mask lies an organization that thrives on
secrecy: totalitarian, driven by fascist instincts, undemocratic,
manipulative.''

<TEXT>
   President Alan Garcia will leave office
Saturday in disgrace, having presided over the most disastrous
economic decline in Peru's 169-year history, but he may be back.
   Many politicians and analysts think he plans to seek the
presidency again in 1995, after sitting out a term because Peruvian
presidents cannot serve consecutive terms.
   ``Alan Garcia is a first-rate politician,'' said independent
congressman Alfredo Barnechea, a former ally. ``He's a man full of
political resources and talents.''
   Barnechea is skeptical of Garcia's chances, however, because of
the liberal, free-market revolution spreading over the world.
   Garcia has ``entered a hard rock disco singing boleros from the
1950s,'' said Barnechea, who quit the president's center-left
Aprista Party and is allied with the more conservative Democratic
Front. ``At some point, the people are going to realize this.''
   When he took office five years ago, Garcia was 36 years old,
6-foot-3 with a baby face, the youngest president on the continent.
   Some called him the John F. Kennedy of Latin America because of
his youth and the hope his populism inspired.
   His waist has thickened since 1985 and his speeches draw more
jeers than applause. One pundit described him as less the Kennedy
of the region than the Elvis Presley.
   Garcia's most publicized actions were limiting payments on the
foreign debt to 10 percent of foreign earnings, then stopping all
payments. He used the money to finance a dramatic, short-lived
economic expansion.
   As the boom slowed, the government was plagued by labor strife,
leftist insurgencies and an elephantine bureaucracy that gobbled up
intis, the Peruvian currency, as fast as they were printed.
Garcia's popularity plummeted.
   During his term, inflation totaled 2 million percent and 10,000
people were killed in a spreading guerrilla war.
   Four-fifths of Peruvian workers do not have steady jobs. The
nation owes $20 billion abroad and is isolated from international
lenders.
   On two occasions, Garcia fended off coup threats by the
military. At one point in 1988, he did not leave the Government
Palace for 34 straight days and offered his resignation to Vice
President Luis Alberto Sanchez, who was 88 years old and blind.
Sanchez refused it.
   An understanding of the Aprista party is necessary to any
assessment of Garcia's potential appeal and chances of a comback,
Barnechea said.
   It is officially called APRA, for American Popular Revolutionary
Alliance, and was founded in 1924 as a non-communist alternative to
the anti-imperialist left and anti-elitist middle class.
   The party won elections in 1962, but the military prevented it
from taking power. In 1985, Garcia became the first Aprista
president.
   APRA became Peru's best-organized party during 61 years of
opposition, with its own flag and anthem. Many of those years were
spent underground, with the party leaders in exile.
   Barnechea described APRA as a ``complex institution'' that had
lost its sense of political identity.
   ``Like all mythologies, it exists at a distance from reality,''
he said. ``The victory or failure of its deeds have no relation to
the rise or fall in the faith of its followers.''
   He said the party's 20 percent of the vote in the first round of
the 1990 presidential election came mostly from party diehards, and
``it's perfectly conceivable Garcia believes this to be a good
start for a presidential campaign'' in 1995.
   Garcia regained his stride and some of his popularity in the
1990 campaign. Although Aprista candidate Luis Alva Castro was
eliminated in the first round, the president remained a factor in
the runoff between centrist Alberto Fujimori and novelist Mario
Vargas Llosa, a champion of free markets.
   He used the government newspaper and television station, as well
as Pagina Libre, a new Lima newspaper in which he is said to hold a
major share, to attack Vargas Llosa's ``economic shock'' proposals.
   Fujimori won the June 10 election in a landslide, and Garcia
quickly claimed the victory.
   ``Mr. Fujimori represents the negation of everything the other
candidate stood for,'' he said. ``The voters said no to liberalism,
no to the right. ... I'm totally identified with the feeling behind
that vote.''
   Since the election, Fujimori has slowly warmed to the idea of an
economic shock and has begun mending fences with foreign lenders.
The new president has said he will dismantle Garcia's price subsidy
programs and controls on currency exchange rates.
   The shift by Fujimori leaves Garcia an opening to lead the
opposition, which analysts say would help his chances in 1995 if
the new government falters.
   ``Alberto Fujimori shouldn't forget his commitment and
responsibility is first with Peru's poor majority,'' said an
unsigned editorial in Pagina Libre that many believe Garcia wrote.
   Political commentator Fernando Rospigliosi wrote of Garcia in
the news magazine Caretas: ``Between being the head of the
opposition or an ally with the government, there's no doubt which
role he would prefer.''

<HEAD>The Strangest Bedfellows? Don &amp; Buster &amp; Steve &amp; John</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For two ugly weeks, boxing's dirty laundry
filled a Manhattan courtroom: promoters discussing their lies,
lawyers flinging charges and countercharges, the heavyweight
champion of the world reduced to mere verbal sparring.
   When it ended this past week with a negotiated peace, Las Vegas
hotel casino owner Steve Wynn stepped into the sunshine of a
downtown sidewalk and proclaimed the whole exercise beneficial to
business.
   ``I hope so. I hope so,'' Wynn replied when asked if the legal
shenanigans would help hype the upcoming James ``Buster''
Douglas-Evander Holyfield fight, which may itself visit the
courtroom before it reaches the ring.
   ``This will be the biggest betting fight since Hagler-Leonard,''
said Wynn, cutting quickly to the one thing that turns boxing's
bitterest enemies into fast friends: money.
   As Don King, an expert on boxing's scheming and scamming, has
said again and again and again, ``Only in America.''
   Buster hates Don. Buster's manager hates Don. Don is afraid of
Steve. Buster thinks Don's a liar. Don thinks Buster's breaking a
contract. Which means, of course, that all four are now partners in
promoting Buster's next fight after Holyfield.
   Wynn's elation was over an agreement that could pit Douglas
against Holyfield on Oct. 25 in the first heavyweight title fight
since Feb. 10 _ eight months of lawyers instead of lefts, juries
instead of jabs.
   Douglas has spent more time on the witness stand _ 40 minutes _
than he has in the ring _ none _ since his upset knockout of
ex-champ Mike Tyson.
   ``It's a horrible shame that Buster Douglas' reign is
characterized by repeated lawsuits,'' said Kathy Duva of Main Event
Monitor Promotions. ``This whole thing has been a sin.''
   Duva's company handles Holyfield, and they intend to hold
Douglas to a Sept. 21 fight date to which both sides agreed before
the Douglas-King legal battle. Main Event joined in the
interminable litigation by asking a judge to order that the fight
take place as originally scheduled.
   This follows the U.S. District Court trial in a suit brought by
King against Douglas. Lowlights of the case included:
   _ King's description of the heavyweight champion as a hot
dog-and-beer fighter: ``When he came on, people went to the
refreshment stand.''
   _ King and fellow promoter Bob Arum's bizarre excuses for their
mendacious behavior. According to Don: ``I wouldn't call it lying.
That's just my style.'' As for Arum, he pleaded hyperbole:
``Hyperbole is not lying. Hyperbole is exaggeration.''
   _ Wynn, who will be King's co-promoter for Douglas' first fight
after Holyfield, was ominously characterized by his spiky-haired
soon-to-be business partner as someone ``everyone's afraid of.''
   _ Arum boasted that his description of WBC President Jose
Sulaiman and WBA President Gilberto Mendoza as ``two little
Noriegas'' was ``one of my better lines.''
   _ Arum also told the jury what constituted peace in the boxing
world: just a single lawsuit pending between himself and King.
   ``Do you know how many times Don King and I have sued each other
over the past 10 years?'' Arum asked. ``We've done dastardly things
to each other we wouldn't do to other people.''
   Arum, who spent most of the last decade going after King's
throat, appeared as a witness on his ex-adversary's behalf.
   Things were so strange in the courtroom that U.S. District Judge
Robert W. Sweet, who presided over the trial, told attorneys for
both sides, ``I wouldn't want to be a juror in this case for
anything.''
   One exasperated lawyer, worn out by attempts to cross-examine
King, told Sweet, ``Mr. King's perception of what is being asked
often differs from reality.''
   ``Sometimes that's a problem,'' the judge acknowledged.
   But all the problems were worked out, as they always are, so
that everybody can make a buck. Forgive and forget _ until next
time.
   ``The issue was emotional. The problem started in Tokyo. But
once we got together and worked things out, it went away,'' Wynn
explained after the settlement.
   Translation: King and Donald Trump received several million
dollars just to walk away. Douglas will make his money again in the
ring, benefiting his manager, Wynn and Wynn's Las Vegas hotel
casino.
   After the settlement, King announced he'd finally give Douglas a
promised $100,000 bonus for defeating Tyson. ``I'm a man of my
word,'' King said in the hallway outside the courtroom, ignoring
the smirks of reporters.
   King also invited all the jurors to his next fight promotion,
the Sept. 22 Atlantic City bout between Tyson and Alex Stewart. The
panelists appeared amazed by the greed, backstabbing and chicanery
they'd heard about in court.
   One of the jurors, talking with Douglas' manager, John Johnson,
after the settlement, summed it up best.
   ``In boxing, it doesn't seem you can listen to what anybody
says,'' Gabrielle Mellett told Johnson, who nodded in agreement.
``What they say isn't really what they mean.''

<HEAD>Job Losses Tougher in Rural America Than in Cities, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unemployment is hitting rural areas harder
these days, partly because so many communities now depend less on
farming and more on other types of jobs, according to a report
released Saturday.
   The Economic Policy Institute report said that in the 1980s a
proportionately larger number of rural workers were laid off
compared to their urban counterparts.
   ``Between 1981 and 1984, approximately 6.3 million workers were
displaced from full-time wage and salary jobs,'' the report said.
``Of these, 1.6 million, or 26 percent, resided in rural areas,
higher than the rural share of total employment, 21 percent.''
   Rural workers also experienced longer periods of unemployment
and were more likely to be forced into new jobs at lower pay than
their old ones.
   The report, ``Job Displacement and the Rural Worker,'' said
rural economies have grown away from a reliance on agriculture and
have become more dependent on manufacturing and service industries.
Thus, it said, rural workers are more vulnerable to shifts that
result in widespread job loss from layoffs and plant closings.
   The study's author, Michael Podgursky of the University of
Massachusetts, said rural workers have a harder time recovering
from economic dislocation. Both earnings and employment prospects
for rural workers diminished in the 1980s.
   ``Permanent job loss from layoffs and plant closings is
occurring more frequently in rural areas, and the effect is much
more severe,'' Podgursky said. ``Rural Americans are at a distinct
disadvantage in the labor market. The economic infrastructure of
rural regions just cannot absorb large numbers of unemployed
workers.''
   For example, the study said about 15 percent of rural displaced
workers remained unemployed after losing their jobs, compared with
10 percent for jobless city workers.
   Also, displaced rural workers were 50 percent more likely to
experience a severe loss of earnings _ a pay cut of more than 25
percent _ than city workers.
   Loss of group health insurance is another major problem for
displaced rural workers, the report said. Only 65 percent were able
to obtain new health care insurance, compared with 74 percent for
urban workers.
   The Economic Policy Institute is a non-profit, non-partisan
economic research organization founded in 1986 and supported by
grants from foundations, unions, corporations and individuals.
   Rural development is an old struggle. It has involved virtually
every chamber of commerce, Main Street business and industry for
generations.
   There have been repeated moves in Congress to assist rural
development, ranging from public works and tax incentives to
expanded credit programs and outright grants.
   Both the House and Senate have approved rural development bills.
Differences between the two have yet to be settled by conference
negotiations.
   The Senate version includes a $300 million revolving fund for
new businesses, satellite education and health communications
systems. The House bill would establish state review panels to set
priorities on how federal money should be used.
   But federal spending cuts and budget considerations are putting
the squeeze on all programs.
   Earlier this month, the White House announced a new President's
Council on Rural America to advise on ``how the federal government
can improve its rural economic development policy.''
   Councils, committees or task forces have been common through the
years. And often their recommendations are limited by the
availability of funds.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter was asked after the White
House announcement about recommendations made by previous rural
development advisers, including a plan announced by President Bush
in January.
   ``Some of their recommendations are either in the process of
being implemented or are under consideration within the
department,'' he said.
   Yeutter added that he thought there has been ``a lot more
rhetoric than performance in rural development through the years.
We've been talking about rural development in the Department of
Agriculture and in this country for the last 20 years but not
accomplishing very much.''
   The report by the Economic Policy Institute reinforces other
studies that have shown rural America to be on the short end of the
nation's economic and social scale.
   For example, the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities reported
that 33 percent of the working poor live in rural areas, although
only 23 percent of the U.S. population lives there.
   ``Most of the rural poor who are not elderly, disabled or sick
are people who work but earn too little to escape poverty,'' the
center said in a report last October.

<HEAD>No Quick, or Easy, Fix for the Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While it makes a handy slogan in a campaign
year, the balanced budget amendment wouldn't have put a dent in the
deficit any time soon, if ever.
   Curbing deficits will require tough, politically painful
decisions on spending and taxes, item by item. By contrast, there's
no political downside to a vote in favor of amending the
Constitution in the name of balanced federal budgets.
   So a House majority voted for the amendment, falling just seven
short of the two-thirds margin it takes to approve a proposed
change in the Constitution. A day later, the House overwhelmingly
approved a bill to require that government revenues and
expenditures be equal beginning in the next budget year.
   That, too, is political symbolism, because it probably won't
pass the Senate and couldn't be enforced even if it became law. But
it gave House members another opportunity to record votes in favor
of balanced budgets after the constitutional amendment was turned
down on Tuesday.
   Measures like those have been argued for years, sometimes
approved, then forgotten or waived _ nearly 400 times in a decade
in the case of a measure that was supposed to curb spending.
   The only restraint that counts is the one that has the heat on
now: the Gramm-Rudman budget control law that will force drastic,
automatic spending cuts in the middle of the fall campaign unless
Congress and the White House come to terms on sharp reductions in
the projected deficit, now forecast at a swollen $168.8 billion.
That law, too, has been eased, and probably will be again as part
of any 1990 settlement.
   The problem is that deficits are made up of hundreds of
decisions, not one judgment that can be reversed with a single
stroke. No constitutional amendment is going to balance the budget,
any more than a constitutional amendment stopped people from
drinking liquor.
   Habits persist, no matter what is written into the Constitution,
and deficits have been habitual, the pattern in 50 of the past 58
years, the rule in 20 of the past 21.
   Every spending program has a constituency of interests and
individuals _ voters _ who benefit, while the cost is spread among
all the taxpayers or added to the national debt. The congressman
who votes for spending targeted at his constituents can, and does,
follow up with speeches denouncing deficits.
   Eight years ago, Ronald Reagan pushed a balanced budget
amendment as an antidote to his own administration's budget, which
forecast a record deficit. Reagan, and now President Bush, have
been seeking approval ever since, although neither has sent
Congress a balanced budget.
   In 1982, the Senate, controlled by Republicans, approved the
amendment 69 to 31. The House turned it down, 46 votes short of the
required two-thirds majority.
   The Senate came within a vote of reviving the balanced budget
amendment in 1986, narrowly rejecting a Democratic version. That
measure is up again, but House rejection forecloses congressional
approval of an amendment this year. Were one to be approved, it
would go to the states for ratification.
   The near miss in the House this time reflects the frustration,
the dilemma, and the political discomfort of deficits that have
swollen the national debt to $3.1 trillion and counting.
   The version the House rejected would have required presidents to
propose balanced budgets each year, with Congress and the
administration then agreeing on anticipated revenues and spending
no more unless three-fifths of the members of each house vote to do
so.
   That certainly would make deficit votes more difficult. But it
comes with variables, loopholes and no enforcement terms. And it
orders an outcome, not a solution. One opponent, Rep. Jack Brooks,
D-Texas, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said it would mean no
more than a bumper sticker.
   While they argued about the impact of an amendment, sponsors and
opponents agreed in their set-piece debate that Congress lacks the
political will and the courage to cope with the deficit.
   An advocate said the only people who would have been hurt by a
balanced budget amendment, including a provision making it more
difficult to impose new taxes, would be thousands of lobbyists who
want taxes raised so they can get more money appropriated for the
interests they represent.
   But lobbyists don't vote, on taxes or on appropriations. Members
of Congress do that.

<HEAD>Portraits of Performance Artists Denied NEA Grants</HEAD>

   The words almost shout off the wall of what used
to be a 19th century mercantile shipping supply house in the now
fashionable section of Manhattan called Tribeca.
   ``It's my body. It's not Pepsi's body. It's not Nancy Reagan's
body. It's not Congress's body ... My body is paid for in full by
me. My body is mine,'' says the defiant, hand-painted script.
   These are the thoughts and ideas of Karen Finley, one of four
``performance artists'' denied fellowship grants in June by the
National Endowment for the Arts. The rejections triggered a
firestorm of protests from arts groups across the country as well
as support for the NEA decision by conservative critics in Congress
and various religious groups.
   The four were turned down for fellowships by NEA chairman John
Frohnmayer and its advisory board, the National Council on the
Arts, despite unanimous recommendations by a peer panel. Fourteen
performance artists did receive grants, ranging from $5,000 to
$11,250.
   Performance art first flourished in the mid-1970s, primarily in
the New York and Los Angeles art worlds. It used theater, dance,
music and the visual arts to make its points. Works were staged
everywhere, from theaters to the streets. Artists could use
everything from elaborate props and costumes to none at all.
Anything went, and usually did.
   The other rejected artists are Holly Hughes of New York, John
Fleck of Los Angeles and Tim Miller of Santa Monica, Calif. But so
far, Finley has received the most publicity.
   Finley's installation at Franklin Furnace, an organization
founded in 1976 to present visual works as well as performance art,
includes two long essays painted on the walls of the gallery. Both
essays deal with violence against women, specifically rape and
abortion. The language is frank, often violent and crude.
   The four artists denied grants are all in their 30s. All have
received federal money in the past. And all are appealing their
rejections. Three of the artists are homosexual and celebrate their
sexuality in their work.
   Some, like Finley, use nudity in performance. Much has been made
in the media of Finley's performance piece ``We Keep Our Victims
Ready,'' in which she dances nude and smears her body with
chocolate to show the degradation of women.
   ``I am being punished because I am a morally concerned artist,''
Finley said during a recent emotional press conference at the
Public Theater.
   Finley, 34, was raised in Evanston, Ill., where her mother was a
civil rights activist and her father sold appliances and worked as
a jazz drummer. She grew up on the rhetoric of the 1960s, being
particularly moved by the speeches of Martin Luther King and John
Kennedy.
   ``I have made a commitment in creating work that addresses
social concerns,'' said Finley, who when she isn't touring lives
with her husband in Nyack, N.Y., north of New York City. ``Much of
my work deals with victims in our society and I use the language of
how society treats these victims: women, people living with AIDS,
minorities, gays and lesbians, the homeless and the victims of
child abuse, incest and violent crimes.''
   Hughes' work is sexual but she uses humor, too, to make
political statements. The 35-year-old performer is from Saginaw,
Mich., where she grew up in a middle-class Republican household.
Hughes came to New York to be a painter, but ended up in
performance art, acting out her own pieces in small downtown and
East Village clubs.
   She calls her work ``story-telling,'' and her best-known
monologue is titled ``World Without End,'' written in honor of her
mother, who died in 1987.
   ``It's about my mother telling me the facts of life,'' Hughes
said in an interview. ``The piece is informational. I realized it
was amazingly in contrast to a lot of stories I had heard from
friends of mine whose mothers gave them absolutely no sexual
information. It was a very positive experience. In the piece I say
it was a gift, the best thing my mother ever did for me. She had a
certain pride in her body that was really wonderful.''
   John Fleck calls himself a pop culture commentator but he's an
actor as well. ``For the last six months I've been doing other
people's work,'' he says. ``To me, I'm doing theater.''
   Fleck moved to California from Cleveland 18 years ago at age 21
to attend the Los Angeles branch of the American Academy of
Dramatic Arts. He studied there for three years.
   ``Ever since then, I've been doing every workshop imaginable,''
he says, ``I also type 110 words per minute. That's how I also
supported myself.''
   There also were small parts in the mainstream of show business _
three lines in an episode of ``Cheers,'' a spot on ``Hooperman,''
various commercials, a short moment on screen with Bernadette
Peters in the Clint Eastwood film ``Pink Cadillac.''
   Fleck started doing his own work about eight years ago in Los
Angeles rock 'n' roll clubs. ``I'd get up and sing and dance and
kind of rip my clothes off,'' he said, laughing. ``You know you
have to do a lot to keep those hedonists' attention, so to speak.''
   He started doing more theatrical pieces about five years ago.
   ``I have a 3{-octave voice, so I'd play all the male and females
roles,'' he said. ``My early pieces had a lot to do with sexual
ambiguity, the split between the male and female sides of myself
and the conflict created by them not being able to accept one
another.''
   Tim Miller's monologues also deal with his sexuality.
   ``My performances draw from stories and points of view from my
own life,'' said the 31-year-old Miller, originally from Whittier,
Calif. ``A lot of it explores my identity as a gay person. There's
a lot of political content in the material.''
   Miller also is an AIDS activist and his work reflects his
frustration and anger with the federal government for what he says
is its slow response to the AIDS crisis. But there is humor in his
work, too.
   ``I talk about sex, but no more than Eddie Murphy and probably
quite a bit less,'' he said. Miller has just returned from an
extended, cross-country tour, playing everywhere from high schools
to art museums. He also worked with Malcolm Boyd, an openly gay
Episcopal priest and author of ``Are You Running With Me Jesus?'',
in what Miller calls ``performance art sermons'' done in a
California church on Easter Sunday.
   All four artists are receiving more offers to work than they
have gotten in the past. Finley's performance in New York at
Lincoln Center's Serious Fun Festival this Wednesday quickly sold
out and a second performance was added.
   Still, the notoriety has had its affect on them.
   ``It's horrible in a way,'' Hughes said. ``Artists want
attention, but it's not the kind of attention you want. It's not
coming from someone saying, `Wow! She's the most fabulous thing
since canned ham.' People are coming to see me because they wonder,
`Is she really as terrible as they say?' or `Is she really
pornographic?' It has become sort of a freak show.''

   So, you say, what will happen when they
lock four men and four women inside this fancy fish bowl for two
years and watch 'em grow alfalfa sprouts and rice?
   How, indeed, are eight ``biospherians'' going to fare testing
the completely sealed compound with five adjacent but contrasting
environments, called biomes, as well as an intensive agricultural
complex, to duplicate the Earth's ecology?
   How are they going to react in shepherding 3,800 species of
plants and animals that will provide food and air while all wastes
are recycled within Biosphere II?
   And in getting along with each other?
   Exceedingly well, according to predictions.
   It's unlikely, all agree, that any of the eight crew members to
be selected later this year from among 14 candidates in this $30
million private experiment, will go bonkers. Withdrawal or
confrontation under stress are unlikely, all say.
   ``They're so highly motivated in the first place, I would not be
surprised to see the whole thing go through without a hitch,
personnel-wise,'' said Robert B. Bechtel, an environmental
psychologist at the University of Arizona.
   ``My guess would be that they would probably have somewhat fewer
problems than you would normally encounter in the classical
isolation experience,'' said Mary Connors, a psychologist and
division staff member at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Ames Research Center near Sunnyvale, Calif., who
until recently was acting chief of its Crew Research and Space
Human Factors Branch. ``They just have more options.''
   The biospherians will be physically separated from the outside
world, or Biosphere I, but they will not be isolated, said John
Rummel, a life sciences physician at NASA. Nor are they likely to
suffer sensory deprivation or claustrophobia in the main compound,
which measures 2\ acres.
   They'll have the latest gadgets, from video teleconferencing and
worldwide phone contact to television, VCRs and computers in their
plush apartment complex and office-laboratory area.
   And they will have unusual options if they want to get away from
each other. The biospherians will be able to stargaze from their
own rain forest or ocean beach.
   Experiments in long-term situations where small groups of people
live in harsh climatic or environmental extremes, such as the in
Antarctica or underwater, usually are viewed in terms of
``isolation, confinement, deprivation and risk,'' Connors said.
   But crew members will be allowed to leave through air locks if
health or extreme family emergencies necessitate, eliminating the
sense of risk, she said.
   Roy Walford, a pathologist, nutrition specialist and the only
physician seeking one of the eight slots, says he thinks the
biggest problem may be overwork.
   A community and rural health family practitioner associated with
the University of Arizona who has developed a close relationship
with the candidates will be among those watching from the outside.
   Walford and Biosphere spokeswoman Kathleen Dyhr, also hoping to
make the crew, said each candidate has worked on the project for at
least three years.
   Ms. Dyhr said the selection process uses no psychological
testing. Rather, such factors as ability to work together,
problem-solving skills, willingness to accept other views and
professionalism are keys, and ``by selecting for some of those
factors you can relieve a lot of interpersonal tensions.''
   Connors and Bechtel said the strong job focus, cross-work
training and the fact that the potential crew members have worked
and spent significant time together all are highly advantageous.
   Creativity, spontaneity, withdrawal, unexpected irritability,
eating patterns and general health will be watched, but the best
sensors likely will be the crew members themselves.
   Most say the crew will develop its own ``equilibrium'' once
closed life gets under way.
   But will that lead to romantic relationships, to interludes
under the waterfall or in the huge basements beneath the complex?
Will the crew be celibate?
   Views range from ``who cares'' to unlikely to probable.
   ``Mine has always been that it's unlikely, because I think
people tend to act as crews when they get in an experience that is
prolonged,'' Connors said.
   ``I would suspect that they would get into a familial
relationship rather than a couples relationship ... more like
siblings act,'' she said.
   Bechtel said: ``How could you avoid it? But on the other hand,
they're in a fish bowl.''
   ``Let's just put it this way,'' Ms. Dyhr said, ``there's nothing
really that a corporation can do about what their employees do
after 5 o'clock. We live in a free country and for the most part
people do whatever they want to do.''
   But what if two people fall in love? Is marriage by
teleconferencing possible?
   ``Given the fact that various members of the clergy have shown
themselves to be innovative and agreeable to doing marriages under
very unusual circumstances, I'm sure that they could find a way to
do it,'' Ms. Dyhr said.
   On the other extreme, the psychologists say literature on
confinement and isolation studies shows few examples of violence.
   The Biosphere's purpose is ``not to test interpersonal
relations,'' but to test ``whether they can reproduce the Earth's
atmosphere by a mixture of plants, animals and bacteria,'' Bechtel
said.
   Bechtel thinks the biggest problem will be whether seals around
the glass panels covering the gigantic geodesic dome stay under
wide ranges of heat and cold.
   He and Connors also said most studies of crews, including
mixed-sex groups in environments far harsher and smaller than the
biospherians are likely to encounter, have shown them to be highly
motivated, energetic and willing to put up with almost anything for
the sake of the project and the team's success.
   Bechtel said the public has a misconception that putting eight
people together will mean ``all kinds of interesting things can
happen.''
   Rather, he said, ``They're really caretakers. They're really out
there to tend the plants and animals. It's a kind of farming
adventure.''

<HEAD>A Pediatrician, Public Health Pro and Politico Sets His Course at
CDC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nissan pickup with the George Bush bumper
sticker has become a regular sight out front. The soft-spoken,
bespectacled Alabama pediatrician-turned-politico is learning his
way around.
   And four months after taking over as director of the Centers for
Disease Control, William L. Roper has set about charting his course
for his 5,000-employee agency.
   Even if pressed, he won't predict the next big breakthroughs in
public health. But he is willing to talk about public health _ his
field before entering the world of the federal government _ and his
three personal priorities for the CDC, the government's lead public
health agency.
   Soon after coming to CDC, Roper outlined those priorities in
three speeches.
   One is strengthening the nation's public-health infrastructure,
although he jokes that ``discussions of infrastructure are among
the world's leading insomnia cures.''
   The second is emphasizing prevention.
   ``One of the real challenges is that it requires, to a great
extent, motivating individual people to take actions that they do
not see an immediate benefit from,'' such as stopping smoking or
eating right, he said in a recent interview.
   Roper's third priority, and perhaps his most important, is
promoting children's health _ not surprising for a pediatrician.
   ``We have not done nearly as much as we could do to improve the
health of children in America,'' Roper said. ``We have focused
resources and attention dominantly on illnesses affecting middle
aged and senior citizens, and I think it's time we did the same for
children.
   ``It's not that children's health is worse today than it was
five years, 10 years, 20 years ago; it's just that it's not nearly
as good as it can be.''
   While setting his priorities, Roper hopes to forge a new
identity for the CDC itself, a seven-center agency.
   CDC's niche is epidemiology, the tracking and prevention of
disease, ``as opposed to some of the more tangible things that our
sister agency NIH (National Institutes of Health) does when they
unveil a breakthrough treatment for some illness,'' Roper explained.
   ``In a variety of ways, I'm trying to give CDC an identity for
itself,'' he added.
   The CDC prides itself on its alliances with state and local
health officials; prevention programs developed in Atlanta are
passed on to state officials and then to local health clinics.
   ``The most important thing for us to do is to develop the
information and the strategies that others can use,'' said Roper, a
former Alabama county health official. ``We at the federal
government level are at least two steps removed from where the
action really is.''
   Roper says he intends to be a strong crusader against smoking,
which kills an estimated 1,000 Americans each day. While his boss,
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, has yet to
directly condemn federal tobacco subsidies, Roper says flatly that
it's incongruous to pay farmers to grow a cancer-causing crop.
   ``But you know how that gets stopped?'' he asked. ``It's not
CDC. It's Congress. ... If Congress wanted to change this, they
could.''
   However, he concedes, ``one of our audiences is the U.S.
Congress. I have a role to play there in persuading them to take
action.''
   Roper describes himself as a ``strongly committed federalist,''
set on seeing that enough federal money goes through the states to
the local health departments.
   But Roper, administrator of the Health Care Financing
Administration before joining the Bush administration as a science
issues specialist, is well aware that times are tough for many
federal programs.
   ``The federal budget is in real difficulty,'' he said. ``I'd be
kidding myself if I said all I've got to do is raise my hand and
we'll have a gusher of money. We have to sell people on the
worthiness of CDC programs.''
   But, he added, ``I wouldn't have taken this job if I didn't see
my way clear to some successes on the budget front.''
   Still, financing of federal health programs has been a major
concern of CDC's critics _ and it will continue to be under Roper,
at least for a while.
   ``We know that Roper's a political guy,'' said Mark Harrington,
a member of the treatment and data committee at the advocacy group
ACT-UP (AIDS Committee To Unleash Power).
   ACT-UP has accused the CDC of limiting AIDS case-counting
measures, refusing to recognize legitimate cases and minimizing the
perceived problem in order to limit the government's expenditures
on the disease.
   ``We're worried that rather than taking a medical look at the
epidemiology, they'll keep on playing that political game,''
Harrington said. ``But it's really too early to accuse him (Roper)
of that.''

<HEAD>Get Blood Test for Diabetes Risk Only If Plan To Be Studied, Group

   Close relatives of insulin-dependent diabetics
should take a blood test that reveals high risk of getting the
disease, but only if they will consider entering a research study,
the American Diabetes Association says.
   The public should avoid the test, an association official says.
   The association's statement covers siblings, parents and
children of insulin-dependent diabetics. About 1 million Americans
have this form of the disease, which usually strikes in childhood
or adolescence.
   People with insulin-dependent diabetes must take daily insulin
injections.
   In recent years, scientists have developed several screening
tests to point out people at high risk of developing
insulin-dependent diabetes.
   The new statement was adopted in June at the association's
annual meeting. It is the association's first acknowledgement that
insulin-dependent diabetes can be predicted, said Richard Kahn,
chief scientific and medical officer.
   The association statement discourages screening that is
unrelated to research studies. It recommends screening of close
relatives of insulin-dependent diabetics, but only if those found
to be at heightened risk are referred to institutions doing
research into prevention or some other aspect of the disease, the
statement says.
   Without such a followup, screening is ``an expensive exercise
that doesn't get one anywhere,'' said Dr. Jay Skyler, chairman of
the task force that developed the policy.
   An initial screening test, which is being offered commercially
for about $300, can indicate a heightened risk of developing
diabetes but not say when the disease will appear, Skyler said.
   A positive result creates ``an enormous amount of anxiety on the
part of family members,'' he said. So ``maybe its better not to
know'' unless the screened person will consider participating in
research, which may prevent the disease from appearing, Skyler said.
   Scientists are ``itching to go'' with large-scale studies of
possible preventive therapies, Kahn said. Such experiments, which
may start within six months, are aimed at suppressing the immune
system's attack on insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, he said.
   The initial screening test looks for proteins called antibodies
in the blood that indicate the body has begun attacking the
insulin-producing cells, called islet cells.
   Such antibodies are present in the blood of 80 percent to 90
percent of people with insulin-dependent diabetes at the time of
diagnosis, and most of them also have the antibodies for several
years before diagnosis, Skyler said.
   While perhaps one in 20 close relatives will show those
antibodies, the rate for the general population is about one in
1,000, he said.
   The association discourages using the test for the general
population because that yield is low, because the test's predictive
value outside of close relatives is not firmly established, and
because the test requires extensive followup procedures to better
assess a person's risk, he said.
   The followup tests include a search for antibodies that attack
insulin, and a test of how well the pancreas secretes insulin in
response to sugar.
   Studies suggest that combined results of these tests can
indicate relatives who are virtually certain to develop
insulin-dependent diabetes within five years, Kahn said.

   Chaos is making its way into the American
kitchen.
   The scientific concept of chaos, known to experts as fractal
geometry, is being researched by food manufacturing specialists
seeking ways to make or improve instant foods.
   Fractals describe the geometry of rugged surfaces, including
everything from coastlines to trees to instant hot cocoa mix.
   The relationship between fractals and instant foods brought a
University of Puerto Rico chemical engineer to the Institute of
Food Technologists' annual conference recently at the Anaheim
Convention Center.
   Gustavo V. Barbosa-Canovas outlined to the convention his latest
study that applies fractal geometry to food processing.
   ``My approach uses powdered foods and studies how the food
changes shape after exposure to vibrations from packing and
shipping,'' Barbosa said in a telephone interview.
   Applying fractal analysis to food processing was first suggested
in 1985 by food scientists Micha Peleg and M.D. Normand at the
University of Massachusetts.
   ``They made the process feasible by determining the geometry of
instant coffee with a scanning electron microscope,'' Barbosa said.
   Particle contour images were then automatically converted into
digital numbers for computer analysis.
   Barbosa used instant coffee particles because he wanted to
research how their ``ruggedness'' was affected by vibrations from
packing and shipping.
   As vibration or ``attrition'' occurs, food products break down
and decrease serving size.
   ``Food manufacturers are interested in maintaining larger
particles in the food because the larger the particle remains, the
better its `instant' properties,'' he said.
   Barbosa's analysis technique may lead to improvements in a
number of foods, such as instant dry milk, orange juice or
applesauce and some powdered cheeses. It may also work on the crumb
structure of bread, but this hasn't been shown yet, Barbosa said.
   ``If a coffee lover has a choice between an instant coffee that
dissolves immediately and another that takes two minutes to stir,
he will surely pick the more instant brand,'' Barbosa said.
   Agglomerated foods are more rugged because they are fabricated
and are shaped into particles called ``fines.'' Fines are placed in
a moist atmosphere where they stick to one another, forming
``bridges,'' Barbosa said.
   By contrast, regular particles, such as starches and sugars,
don't lend themselves to the technique.
   Barbosa said the science behind chaos proliferated in
professional papers in the 1970s. As use of personal computers
increased, scientists found more ways to measure and calculate the
nearly endless formulas to describe complex surfaces.
   Fractals comes from the Latin word fractus, meaning fragment.
Fractal geometry was introduced in 1977 by scientist Benoit
Mandelbrot, Barbosa said.
   The 25,000-member Institute of Food Technologists is a
professional society devoted to the discovery of new and existing
knowledge to improve the world's foods. Its members come from
academic, industrial and government organizations.

   Most people know that protein is essential, but there are many
misconceptions about how much the body needs and what are the best
sources.
   Take this true-or-false quiz to see if you know the facts.
   1. Most Americans eat more than enough protein.
   2. Proteins that come from animals contain all the essential
amino acids the body needs.
   3. As adults age, they require less protein.
   4. High-protein diets are not recommended for the obese.
   5. Red meats are better protein sources than poultry or fish.
   6. Athletes need significantly more protein than non-athletes.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ANSWERS
   1. (True) Most Americans consume double their requirement for
protein. For example, the RDA for a 130-pound woman is easily met
by eating three ounces of lean meat, one slice of bread, one-half
cup of cottage cheese, and 1 cup of milk.
   2. (True) Animal proteins are considered ``complete,'' meaning
that they contain the needed amounts of the nine essential amino
acids your body must get from food. Vegetables are not complete
sources of protein; they lack essential amino acids or do not
contain them in sufficient quantities to meet your body's needs.
Only by combining complementary vegetables on the same day (e.g.,
rice and beans) can you receive a complete protein source.
   3. (False) Current thinking is that the RDA for protein remains
the same on a weight basis throughout adulthood. Some investigators
think that because of changes in the body's efficiency in using
protein, the elderly might require more. However, since calorie
needs decrease as we age, it is wise for the elderly to select
low-fat sources of protein.
   4. (False) High-protein, low-carbohydrate, very low-calorie
diets can be effective for weight loss in obese people (those who
are approximately 25 percent or more above their normal weight
range). After an initial water loss, significant amounts of fat are
also lost. However, these diets can be hazardous and are
recommended only for heart disease or adult-onset diabetes. And
they should always be undertaken with medical supervision.
   5. (False) Red meats tend to be higher in fat, so the percentage
of protein on an ounce-for-ounce basis is lower than in fish or
poultry.
   6. (False) Although an athlete may need slightly more protein
during the initial stages of training or competition, that need is
not very great. Since most Americans already consume more than
enough protein, chances are the increased need has already been met
by a normal diet.

<HEAD>State Uses Beetles To Attack Pesky Weed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Hirsch left Bismarck before dawn and
headed for Canada _ on a beetle run.
   He should be back with a cooler full of 5,000 flea beetles
eating leafy spurge.
   The strange odyssey is part of the stepped-up battle against the
weed considered one of North Dakota's most persistent pests.
   Hirsch works for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which is importing the
beetles in the hope they will ravage the spurge infesting 1.2
million acres across the state.
   North Dakota has North America's worst infestation of the tall
weed with green-yellow flowers that was brought over from Europe in
the 19th century, said Peter Harris, an entomologist with Canada's
department of agriculture at a research station in Regina,
Saskatchewan. He is considered the dean of biological control of
leafy spurge. He's also in charge of the beetles Hirsch is picking
up.
   The adult bugs Hirsch brings back will lay eggs in North Dakota
soil this summer. The eggs will hatch this fall, and the larvae
will ``hibernate'' and next spring eat spurge root systems before
they become adults.
   After several years, tests in Canada show that up to 90 percent
of a spurge stand could be eliminated, Harris said.
   The state will spend about $460,000 on spraying leafy spurge
over the next two years, mostly in a cost-share program with
counties.

<HEAD>Western Scientists Unprepared for Effects of Interfamily Marriages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As incestuous marriages become more
common in the United States, scientists are unprepared to offer
counseling about the likelihood of genetic disorders, a University
of Michigan researcher said.
   ``I'd been brought up to believe that inbreeding was pretty
nasty,'' said Alan Bittles, a geneticist who has spent 10 years
researching interfamily marriages in Pakistan and India. ``We never
consider that in other parts of the world it's perfectly normal to
marry a cousin.''
   Bittles said he has determined that 500 million people worldwide
are married to relatives, typically uncles and nieces or first or
second cousins.
   ``All those have got to be rock-bottom low estimates, because
we're missing information from so many parts of the world,'' he
said.
   And as people move to the United States and other Western
nations, traditions follow.
   Although there are fewer genetic disorders among children born
to married family members than Westerners believe, scientists have
made few studies of those problems and have little information
about them, he said.
   Inherited disorders include some blood diseases, protein
deficiencies, spina bifida, cleft palates and hip and heart
deformities.
   If parents from the same family marry and seek genetic
counseling, doctors can give only occurrence rates derived from
general population studies, Bittles said.
   ``We may be giving wrong advice,'' he said. ``We would be
hard-pressed in this community to tell them what their risks are.''
   Bittles, a Fulbright Fellow in the University of Michigan
Population Studies Center, is a geneticist from Kings College in
London. He is one of only a few researchers studying intermarriage
but expects the field to grow.
   ``Once people recognize that this is a subject that needs
investigation, that it has tremendous importance on a community,
then they'll start studying it,'' he said.

   The first nest ever reported in Washington
of a bird called a marbled murrelet has been found in old-growth
hemlock, cheering ornithologists and stirring new questions about
logging of old-growth forests.
   ``That's really exciting news,'' said Jim Pissot, executive
director of the Audubon Society of Washington.
   He said it will strengthen the society's drive to see the chubby
little shorebird listed as threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
   The bird is fairly common elsewhere, and little is known about
its nesting habits. But the Audubon petition, filed in January
1988, contends mounting biological evidence shows logging of
coastal old-growth forests threatens the bird's nesting habitat.
   Logging of millions of acres of public old-growth forest in
Washington, Oregon and California already is threatened since the
Fish and Wildlife Service declared the northern spotted owl a
threatened species. The owl nests in old-growth forest.
   Federal officials are working out a management plan to protect
the owl and still take into account the affect on timber
communities. Officials say reductions proposed in a federal
scientific report could mean the loss of more than 20,000 jobs over
the next decade.
   The murrelet nest, containing one chick, was found last week by
state Department of Wildlife researcher Tom Hamers roughly 25 miles
inland from Port Susan in Snohomish County, department spokesman
John Pierce said Wednesday.
   Its parents apparently visit the nest only at dawn and dusk to
feed the chick, he said.
   ``I can't tell you how exciting this is. Although we've had egg
fragments turned in and fledglings found in the forest, this is the
first nest found after years and years of searching,'' he said.
   Pierce said the only other marbled murrelet nest found this year
was in Oregon's Siuslaw National Forest.
   Little is known about the nesting behavior of the brown and
white, robin-size murrelet, according to a recent study by the
state Department of Wildlife.
   ``Ornithologists have searched for its nests throughout its
range from central California to the Bering Sea and from Kamchatka
(Soviet Union) to northern Japan. Yet only 13 nests have been
found,'' said the study, written by Lora L. Leschner and Eric B.
Cummins.
   ``The nests that have been found and recent discoveries of
marbled murrelets at inland locations in Oregon and California
indicate that the species may be traveling inland to nest in
old-growth forests,'' Leschner and Cummins wrote.
   ``The harvest of the last of the old-growth forests in coastal
Washington, Oregon and California and the increased harvest of
old-growth in British Columbia and Alaska could pose a serious
threat to marbled murrelet populations,'' they said.
   Rick Johnson, associate Northwest representative of the Sierra
Club, said the nest discovery ``shows how little we really know
about the ancient forest ecosystem, and in this case points to yet
another species that is probably dependent on the forests for
survival. It means we have an even greater need to know.''

<HEAD>Bankrupty Court Examiner Raises Possibility of Suits in Revco Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Revco drugstore chain was an ignominious
groundbreaker in 1988 when it became the first company to file for
bankruptcy court protection after a billion-dollar takeover
financed with junk bonds.
   Now another precedent could be emerging from the tangled mess of
Revco D.S. Inc.: An examiner appointed by the bankruptcy court said
this week the company's creditors may have grounds to sue
shareholders, investment bankers and other parties to recover
losses caused by the 1986 leveraged buyout.
   The report by examiner Barry L. Zaretsky will only be used as an
advisory opinion by the judge overseeing Revco's reorganization.
But the opinion, if it eventually finds its way into the law, could
have a chilling effect on other companies and other takeovers.
   In his report, Zaretsky said that under the laws of Michigan,
where Revco is incorporated, creditors might be able to sue because
of the so-called ``fraudulent conveyance'' of the company.
   The conveyance occurred when shareholders sold the company to
the management-led investor group that engineered the $1.5 billion
LBO.
   A fraudulent conveyance ``is a transaction made without fair
consideration if the debtor is rendered insolvent or is left with
unreasonably small capital,'' said Zaretsky, a professor at
Brooklyn Law School in New York.
   Zaretsky admits litigation is no panacea for those waiting to
paid. But considering the rash of failed takeovers during the past
year, the prospect of a new avenue of redress for a firm's
creditors is nonetheless appealing.
   In considering who might be liable to Revco creditors, Zaretsky
notes that investment bankers and others who helped arrange the
buyout were paid $80 million in fees, an amount he called ``grossly
disproportionate to the benefit, if any, received by'' Revco.
   If investment firms could be held liable for the failed buyouts
they arrange, they might worry more about the ultimate success of
the deals than with the fees they stood to make.
   Zaretsky stressed in his report that his conclusions were
tentative and based on an as-yet uncompleted examination of Revco's
problems.
   But he said he has found ``a basis for proving the financial
elements of a fraudulent conveyance'' and that ``Revco was left
with insufficient capital to conduct its business.''
   He also found evidence the leveraged buyout rendered Revco
insolvent.
   In reaching his conclusions, the examiner cited, among other
factors, the impact on Revco's business of loan agreements reached
in the buyout process.
   Zaretsky also found fault with financial forecasts used by
proponents of the buyout.
   ``Reasonable projections based on the same assumptions as those
used in projections made available to the examiner would have shown
that Revco was left with insufficient capital to satisfy its then
known obligations,'' he said.
   Zaretsky's findings were filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Akron, Ohio, which is handling the Revco case. Revco, headquartered
in Twinsburg, Ohio, filed for protection from its creditors after
it missed an interest payment on $700 million in junk bonds used to
finance the LBO.
   Zaretsky admits he has raised more questions than he has answers
for. Calling remedies for creditors under a fraudulent conveyance
suit ``largely virgin territory,'' he said he would do further
research before making recommendations on just who should pay, and
how.
   However, he said, ``The courts could fashion an equitable remedy
which would allow unsecured general creditors to be paid in full
with interest at the expense of the parties who contributed to the
fraudulent conveyance.''
   Several times in his report, Zaretsky stated that negotiations
between Revco and its creditors would be a better means of
resolving the situation although the talks have been bogged down
for some time. The examiner advised the court to bring in a
mediator to hasten the processs.
   If a reorganization plan for the company is not in the offing by
November, when statutes of limitations in the case are about to
expire, Zaretsky warned he is ``likely to recommend the
commencement of fraudulent conveyance litigation'' as well as suits
on several other grounds.
   It is possible he is raising the specter of a lawsuit as a way
to get the parties off the dime. Zaretsky warned that if new
litigation is spawned, it will be a long process with uncertain
results, and it may take a further toll on Revco's business.

<HEAD>SEC Supports New Restrictions on Investment Advisers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission says it
supports new restrictions on the multibillion-dollar business of
advising people how to invest their money, but says it could do
more with more money.
   SEC Commissioner Mary L. Schapiro told a House panel Wednesday
that the commission now favors legislation requiring tougher SEC
registration requirements rather than farming out responsibility to
an independent self-regulating organization.
   She said the SEC believed direct SEC regulation of investment
advisers is preferable to self-regulation.
   Last year, the SEC submitted legislation that would give
investment adviser oversight to a self-regulatory organization such
as the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees
the over-the-counter market.
   But in testimony before the finance subcommittee of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, Ms. Schapiro said the SEC
relunctantly lent its support to industry self-regulation because
it didn't have the money to adequately police the industry and
didn't think it was going to get more money soon.
   She called for increasing registration fees investment advisers
pay the SEC and earmarking the money for enforcement. The SEC now
does not keep any of the money it collects in fees, but must turn
it over to the Treasury Department for general government spending.
   Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., a member of the subcommittee, has
submitted a bill that would require anyone offering investment
advice for pay to register with the SEC whether they call
themselves an investment adviser or a financial planner.
   They would be required to provide clients with accurate
information. The bill also would give customers the right to sue
for damages when they lose money because of violations of the law.
   Boucher's bill would not increase SEC fees, however.
   The bill also would continue the exemption from registration now
in effect for banks as well as lawyers, accountants and other
professionals who give investment advice only as a sideline.
   Ms. Schapiro said she had no problem with that but others did.
   Mary A. Malgoire, of the National Association of Personal
Financial Advisors, a professional association of planners that
earn only fees _ not commissions _ opposed the exemptions for
lawyers and accountants.
   She said such professionals, if not registered with SEC, would
not be subject to financial planning oversight from state licensing
boards.
   Outside the hearing room, Ms. Schapiro told reporters the SEC
currently spends $5.7 million annualy on registering and reviewing
investment advisers.
   To do everything recommended in a General Accounting Office
report on investment adviser regulation, she said, the agency would
have to spend an additional $17 million.
   In a report issued Monday, the GAO, the accounting arm of
Congress, warned that investors may be lulled into a false sense of
security because investment advisers must register with the SEC,
although the agency does not evaluate adviser competence.
   The GAO study noted that since 1980, the number of investment
advisers has tripled to about 14,000 while assets they manage have
increased from $440 billion 10 years ago to about $4.6 trillion
today.
   The GAO also found the SEC was behind in reviewing registered
advisers. When advisers are reviewed, usually only inadequate
disclosure or record-keeping problems are uncovered and the SEC
does little to ensure that deficiencies are corrected, the report
said.
   SEC oversight ``provides investors little assurance that the
information they receive from advisers is accurate or that advisers
operate in accordance with'' the law, according to the GAO study.
   The GAO recommended that the SEC inspect all newly registered
advisers within a year and periodically thereafter.
   The SEC, however, noted that to implement the report's
recommendations would require tripling the 53-person staff now
devoted to investment adviser review.
   Ms. Schapiro began her testimony by defending the SEC's track
record and noting the GAO report said ``virtually all of its
important recommendations for a more effective adviser regulatory
program could only be implemented in the commissioner were given
significant additional resources.''

<HEAD>Jury Awards $20 Million For Birth Defects Attributed To Dilantin</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The makers of Dilantin epilepsy
medication knew the drug could cause birth defects in pregnant
women but failed to warn doctors, a Superior Court jury ruled.
   The jury on Wednesday ordered Parke Davis Co. to pay $20 million
to Michael and Brian Keenan, who were born mentally retarded in
July 1978 after their mother took the medication while pregnant.
   ``Parke Davis knew or should have know about the propensity of
the drugs to cause these defects, but failed to warn the medical
community, and in fact suppressed the information,'' said Max
Wistow, the family's lawyer.
   The boys, now 12, live with their parents in Seekonk, Mass., he
said. Their father, Richard, is a construction worker and their
mother, Sandra, is a teaching assistant, he said. She no longer
takes the medication.
   He described the children as ``mildly retarded'' but said there
was doubt they would ever be able to live independently. Most of
their damage is mental but the boys also have some facial
deformity, he said.
   ``We were able to show that in the medical literature through
the world'' there was evidence that Dilantin caused birth defects,
Wistow said. ``Parke Davis had access to this information, and
indeed had it, and wasn't passing it on to physicians through
package inserts.''
   Joseph Kelly, the attorney for Parke Davis, could not be reached
for comment late Wednesday. Telephone calls were not answered at
his home or office.
   He argued during the trial that there was a great deal of
controversy over whether the drug caused birth defects and that the
benefits of the medication outweighed any risks, according to
Wistow. The company also maintained the warnings were adequate,
Wistow said.
   The lawsuit also named Pawtucket Memorial Hospital as a
defendant, claiming it had some knowledge of the potential danger
and failed to convey it, but the jury exonerated the hospital.
   The jury deliberated for almost three days before returning to
Judge John P. Bourcier's chamber. It awarded $2 million in
compensatory damages and $4.9 million in putative damages to each
child. It also ordered $6 million in interest on the compensatory
damage awards.
   The Keenans have a 15-year-old daughter who is healthy, Wistow
said.
   ``Obviously, after eight weeks, we are gratified to see the jury
accepted our position,'' said Wistow.

<TEXT>
   A Long Island woman is suing the makers
of the anti-depressant drug Prozac for $150 million, claiming the
drug caused her to mutilate her own body and to attempt suicide.
   Rhonda Hala of Shirley charged in her suit that the
manufacturer, Eli Lilly &amp; Co. of Indianapolis, failed to warn users
that Prozac could cause an obsession with death and violence.
   There are about 1.5 million people in the United States on
Prozac, with 650,000 prescriptions written each month. An Eli Lilly
spokeswoman, Marie Abbot, said the company is not removing Prozac
from the market and said it has not been shown that the drug causes
suicidal thoughts.
   Mrs. Hala began taking Prozac in 1988 after a spinal disc
procedure and withdrawal from painkillers left her depressed.
Within two weeks, she said, her thoughts turned to suicide.
   During her 18 months on Prozac, she slashed her arms, legs and
stomach with razor blades and dug scissors and screws into her
flesh about 150 times, she said.
   ``I thought I had someone else's brain in my body,'' said Mrs.
Hala, 40, a school secretary.
   She tried six times to kill herself, requiring hospitalization
four times. Her husband and two teen-age children were afraid to
leave her alone.
   ``It was as if I was possessed,'' said Mrs. Hala. ``I was always
a happy, up person, but I became obsessed with self-mutilation.''
   As her mental state deteriorated, her psychiatrist doubled her
dose of Prozac. It was not until he read an article in the American
Journal of Psychiatry that he immediately took Mrs. Hala off the
drug and her life returned to normal.
   In the February article, Dr. Martin Teicher of Harvard
University and his colleagues reported that six patients had
developed violent suicidal thoughts within weeks of taking Prozac.
   Officials at Eli Lilly and the federal Food and Drug
Administration, which approved Prozac in 1988, acknowledge
nationwide reports of serious adverse effects from the drug,
including ``suicidal ideation.''
   But they said it may be impossible to determine if the drug
directly caused the suicidal thoughts, or if they were the result
of the patient's mental depressed state.
   ``The idea that Prozac is a killer drug is a little bit silly,''
said psychiatrist Dr. Jerrold Rosenbaum, chief of the
Psycho-Pharmacology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston and associate professor at Harvard University.
   ``The bottom line is that Prozac is no wonder drug. It has no
extravagant claims attached to it, but it has helped a lot of
people suffering from depression appreciate the benefits of life,''
Rosenbaum said.
   Prozac's known side effects include nausea, a rash, agitation
and jittery nerves.
   In the last year, various Prozac support groups have been formed
by former users of the drug to publicize their claims of side
effects.
   ``This is a terrible drug,'' said Sharyn DiGeronimo, a Selden
resident who founded Prozac Survivors Support Group in New York.
   DiGeronimo said she receives calls from Prozac patients who
report of loosing control or judgement while on the drug. Some were
prescribed Prozac to help them stop smoking or loose weight.
   Abbot, the Eli Lilly spokeswoman, declined comment on the
litigation, but acknowledged the company revised its package
literature on Prozac last May.
   The update listed adverse effects reported to the company since
Prozac went on the market, including ``suicidal ideation or
thoughts associated with the drug.''
   ``Suicidal thoughts are unfortunately common among depressive
patients,'' Abbot said. ``It is important to note that there has
been no cause-effect relationship established between Prozac and
the reports of suicidal ideation.''
   Dr. Paul Leber, director of the FDA's neuropharmocological
products department, said the agency has been monitoring the
reports of suicidal or homicidal thoughts.
   ``We have taken a good, hard look and haven't found anything
that leads us to believe that Prozac causes suicidal thoughts,''
said Leber.

<HEAD>Fed Chief Says He's Prepared to Cut Interest Rates</HEAD>

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says
he is ready to support a big deficit-reduction package by lowering
interest rates. But some private economists wonder whether that
means the Fed is giving up its battle to control inflation.
   Greenspan told Congress on Wednesday that ``a major cut in the
budget deficit is unquestionably the right thing to do.'' He said
the central bank stands ready to counteract any adverse impact that
would occur from implementing a $50 billion package of spending
cuts and tax increases at a time when economic growth is very weak.
   The administration, which has been pressuring the Fed for months
to reduce interest rates, immediately welcomed Greenspan's comments
as very supportive of President Bush's efforts to get a budget
agreement with Congress.
   However, some private economists expressed concern that
Greenspan's statements, coming on a day when the government
reported a worrisome 0.5 percent increase in consumer prices in
June, would spook financial markets by signaling that the Fed was
no longer concerned about controlling inflation.
   ``Greenspan apparently has decided that it is more important to
keep the economy out of a recession than it is to fight
inflation,'' said Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting
firm.
   Evans said Greenspan's decision to relent in the Fed's inflation
battle with prices still rising at an uncomfortable clip would turn
out to be a mistake and require even higher interest rates later to
bring inflation under control.
   ``It is bad for the economy. It will make inflation worse and in
the long run that could lead to the very recession he is trying to
avoid,'' Evans said.
   However, other economists said Greenspan was trying to walk a
difficult line between being supportive of deficit-cutting efforts
while still maintaining vigilance against inflation.
   ``Greenspan is walking a tightrope,'' said David Wyss, an
economist with DRI-McGraw Hill Inc. ``Inflation is not going away,
but the Fed clearly wants to support the budget negotiations.''
   For his part, Greenspan tempered his pledge of support for a
budget accord by insisting that the budget package would have to
offer a credible package of deficit cuts.
   He also insisted there was no danger that the nation was about
to topple into a recession and therefore the central bank had no
plans for an immediate follow-up on the small dose of credit easing
taken last Friday.
   At that time, the Fed supplied enough additional cash to the
banking system to push a key interest rate, the federal funds rate,
down from 8.25 percent to 8 percent, the first decline since last
December.
   The drop in this rate, which banks charge each other for
overnight loans, triggered a big rally on Wall Street, pushing the
stock market to record highs as investors expressed hope that
further rate declines would be forthcoming.
   Greenspan in his testimony Wednesday confirmed that the Fed had
eased slightly last week. He said the action was taken to offset
the effects of banks becoming overly cautious in making loans.
   Based on his comments, many analysts predicted that the Fed
would push the federal funds rate down by another 0.25 percentage
point, perhaps by Labor Day if Congress and the administration have
agreed on the outlines of a deficit-cutting package by then.
   For his part, Greenspan told members of the Senate Banking
Committee, ``I can only offer the assurance that the Federal
Reserve will act, as it has in the past, to endeavor to keep the
economic expansion on track.''
   His statements came as part of his midyear report on the state
of the economy.
   In its economic outlook, the Fed said it expected the economy to
grow at a modest rate of between 1.75 percent and 2.5 percent in
1991, lower than the administration's forecast Monday of 2.9
percent growth.
   In assessing current developments, Greenspan said the country
had an ``economy which is not on the edge of either falling apart
into a recession or about to take on highly inflationary
characteristics.''

<HEAD>FTC Won't Endorse Requirement for Health Warnings on Alcohol Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission says health
warnings on alcohol advertisements could help curb drinking
problems, but it's not endorsing a bill to require the labels.
   Janet D. Steiger, FTC chairwoman, told a House panel Wednesday
that requiring advertising warnings, like the labels now required
on alcohol cans and bottles, ``can be an effective component of a
multi-faceted effort'' against alcohol abuse.
   The beer and alcohol industry is waging a strong fight against
legislation sponsored by Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., and Sen.
Albert Gore, D-Tenn., that would require five rotating health
warnings on beer, wine and liquor ads _ including television
commercials.
   Steiger said ``the evidence is inconclusive'' whether
advertising encourages alcohol consumption.
   ``The decision whether to require the proposed rotating health
warnings in alcohol advertisements is a question of public policy
that is most appropriately decided by the United States Congress,''
she said.
   Kennedy told a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on transportation, tourism and hazardous materials
that beer and other alcoholic beverage ads glamorize drinking and
are aimed at young people.
   Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., criticized the beer industry for
aiming its advertising at young people. To make his point he
displayed a magazine ad for Bud Lite beer featuring the brand's dog
mascot sporting sunglasses and a guitar, beneath the headline:
``Play that funky music, Spuds boy.''
   ``Somebody has got to put pressure on the industry to be more
responsible,'' Slattery said.
   Steiger responded that the FTC was ``assessing'' whether beer
producers were violating federal laws, including the prohibition on
unfair and deceptive advertising. But she refused to reveal what
might come of that investigation or any private conversations
between the FTC and the industry.
   Alcohol beverage producers spend more than $2 billion a year on
advertising and promotion in the United States, according to FTC
figures.
   The bill would require five rotating warnings with messages that
drinking during pregnancy may cause birth defects, that drinking
and driving is dangerous, that drinking may become addictive, and
that it's illegal to buy alcohol for people younger than 21.
   Opposing the bill, James C. Sanders, president of the Beer
Institute, told the panel in written testimony that advertising
doesn't cause alcohol abuse and that warnings may be
counterproductive. He said the brewing industry is trying to fight
alcohol abuse with advertising that urges responsible drinking.
   Tony Debevc of Chalet Debonne Vineyards in Ohio, representing
the Association of American Vintners, said the warnings would
impose a burden on small wineries that rely on promotional displays
and brochures. For both large and small producers, he said, the
warning on ads ``will have the effect of reducing consumption and
thus income.''

   President Bush and congressional leaders say
they will continue their long-running effort to reach a budget
deal, despite a high hurdle House Republicans have flung in their
path.
   Bush and leaders of the House and Senate met privately Wednesday
for 90 minutes at the White House. Both sides said they had made no
significant progress in their hunt for $50 billion worth of
spending cuts and tax increases for next year.
   But they said they would meet again Monday and that other
meetings between White House staff and lawmakers would be held over
the next few days.
   ``A lot of work still to be done,'' Bush told reporters
afterward.
   Earlier Wednesday, rebellious House Republicans voted informally
to oppose any new taxes as part of a deficit-reduction package.
Participants in the closed-door meeting said the non-binding
resolution passed by a 2-1 margin.
   This put them in awkward counterpoint to Bush, who last month
abandoned his 1988 campaign pledge to reject increased levies. But
GOP lawmakers insisted their beef was with Democrats, who they
accused of repeatedly opposing efforts to rein federal spending.
   ``Today we sent a message to congressional Democrats that if
they want to raise taxes, they can do it without us,'' said Rep.
Richard Armey, R-Texas, who sponsored the resolution.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said lawmakers and Bush
had agreed that the Republican vote would not halt the budget
summit, which has been under way for more than two months.
   ``Our decision is to go forward and attempt to reach an
agreement,'' Foley told reporters. ``We will not be derailed in our
effort to reach an agreement.''
   The Democrats reiterated their demand that any budget package
written by negotiators must be approved by a majority of both
parties in the House and Senate.
   The GOP resolution singled out Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, for special vilification.
   ``Mitchell has abandoned the summit goals and emerged as a
consistent roadblock to real spending cuts or growth incentives,
and has championed tax increases at every turn,'' the document said.
   Congressional officials, speaking on condition they not be
identified, said Armey inserted the clause after reading his
original draft _ which did not mention Mitchell _ to White House
chief of staff John Sununu.
   Sununu said the resolution should attack Mitchell, the sources
said. Last week, the majority leader said he would reject a cut in
the capital gains tax unless income tax rates on the wealthy are
increased. Bush is a staunch advocate of reducing the levy on
capital gains _ profits from the sale of investments.
   Mitchell had little to say about his mention in the GOP
resolution.
   Saying he was quoting Abraham Lincoln, he said, ``But for the
honor, I would decline.''
   Attending the White House meeting were Bush, Foley, Sununu,
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.; Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.; House Minority Leader Robert Michel,
R-Ill.; White House budget director Richard Darman; and Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   On Monday, the White House estimated that the budget gap in
fiscal 1991 _ which starts Oct. 1 _ will reach $168.8 billion, and
tens of billions more if the counts of the savings and loan rescue
are counted.
   The Gramm-Rudman law sets a shortfall target for next year of
$64 billion. The law will trigger automatic spending cuts of more
than $100 billion unless a budget pact is reached.
   Lawmakers from the two parties have been meeting separately
since last week, trying to put together packages of spending cuts
and tax increases that could be advanced at the talks as offers.

<HEAD>Teamsters Threaten UPS With Nationwide Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET L. CAPPIELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Teamsters union threat to call a
nationwide strike against United Parcel Service of America Inc.
marks the second round of difficult contract negotiations between
the two sides in less than a decade.
   The union said it may strike if a new three-year contract isn't
approved by July 31, the day the old three-year pact expires, a UPS
spokesman said Wednesday.
   ``We have been informed by the union leadership that if it is
rejected, that is their intent,'' said the spokesman, Ken Sternad.
``We think we've made a very good offer.''
   Sternad said 140,000 to 150,000 part-time and full-time UPS
employees are Teamsters members. The company employs 230,000
workers.
   Repeated calls to the Teamsters union office in Washington,
D.C., and the local office were not returned.
   When the deadline passed during national negotiations in 1982
and talks were extended, UPS informed its customers that it would
stop picking up packages, said Paul R. Schlesinger, an analyst with
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York.
   ``It was, in essence, a lockout. ... The Teamsters quickly got
right-thinking and there was a settlement,'' Schlesinger said.
   He said a strike wasn't likely, partly because both sides would
have too much to lose.
   ``The Teamsters have the ability to hurt UPS badly. UPS has the
ability to take the Teamsters out completely,'' he said, adding
that there are more Teamsters at UPS than at any other company.
   Ballots were mailed during the weekend so union members could
vote on the proposed contract, Sternad said.
   He said the proposal calls for higher wages, improved benefits
and better working conditions, adding that the union members are
already ``the highest paid of any Teamsters in the country.''
   UPS is the world's No. 1 package delivery service. It made 2.8
billion deliveries last year for a record $12.4 billion in revenue.
   There has never been a national strike against UPS, which has
had a national Teamsters contract since 1979, but scattered work
stoppages have occurred, Sternad said.
   The last and biggest one was in 1976, when 18,000 workers in 15
northeastern states walked out for 13 weeks.
   The proposed contract would raise the wages for the average UPS
full-time driver to $18 an hour within two years, Sternad said. UPS
drivers now make an average of $16.10 per hour, he said.
   Part-time workers, mostly package handlers and truck loaders,
currently start at $8 or $9 an hour. Under the proposed contract,
their wages would go up $1.50 an hour, he said.
   Company contributions for health benefits and employees'
pensions, currently at $8,300 a year for full-time workers, would
increase to $10,500 by the end of the three years, Sternad said.
For part-time workers, the rate would increase by $1.05 an hour.
   The proposal also offers a one-time bonus, to be paid within the
first month of ratification, of $1,000 to full-timers and $500 to
part-timers, he said.
   If the workers were to strike, customers could turn to the U.S.
Postal Service, Federal Express, Roadway Package System and other
package delivery companies, analysts said. But opinions were mixed
as to whether those services could handle UPS's business.
   ``UPS handles 10 million pieces a day,'' Schlesinger said.
``There's no way 10 million packages a day are going to be handled
by the competitors.''
   However, Kevin Murphy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in
New York, said other package delivery services would be able to
``pick up the slack.''
   ``The world could live without United Parcel. It wouldn't live
as well, but it could live without them,'' Murphy said.
   Tony Robertson, an analyst with Alex Brown &amp; Sons. Inc. of
Baltimore, said in the event of a strike, UPS would lose some
business to its competitors, but not much.
   ``My guess is a certain percentage of air customers and ground
customers would never come back,'' Robertson said. ``I think any
sort of disruption is going to cost UPS some market share.''
   Sternad said no decision has been made about whether UPS would
hire replacement workers if the union was to strike.

<HEAD>Chicago Merc and Board of Trade Propose Revised Circuit Breaker
Limits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago's Mercantile Exchange and Board of Trade
have urged other exchanges to join them in endorsing a panel's
recommendation for expanded use of trading halts to curb market
volatility.
   The Merc and the Board of Trade on Wednesday jointly proposed
revising their ``circuit breakers'' and procedures on stock index
futures.
   Circuit breakers halt trading when certain triggers are reached.
They are usually keyed to movement in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.
   The revised circuit breakers modify existing price limits on
both the Merc and the Board of Trade, which since 1988 have been
set in coordination with the New York Stock Exchange. The NYSE
calculates its circuit breakers based on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.
   In June, an 18-member New York Stock Exchange panel proposed
halting trading for an hour when the Dow moves up or down 100
points from the previous day's close, 90 minutes when it moves 200
points, and two hours when it moves 300 points.
   The longer halts are designed to give market participants more
time to react.
   The Merc and the Board of Trade also endorsed a recommendation
calling on other securities, securities options and futures
exchanges to adopt these coordinated circuit breakers.
   The New York panel was formed after the 190-point plunge by the
Dow on Oct. 13, 1989.
   The proposed revised circuit breakers need final approval of the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and are conditional on
acceptance of the longer halts by the NYSE and other exchanges.
   In the meantime, the Merc and the Board of Trade will maintain
their daily stock index futures price limits.

<HEAD>Top British and Japanese Computer Makers Negotiating Link</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   STC PLC, the parent company of Britain's biggest
computer maker, today said it was negotiating the sale of a
majority stake in its computer arm to Japan's leading computer
manufacturer, Fujitsu Ltd.
   Such a stake in the subsidiary International Computers Ltd., or
ICL, would give Fujitsu a major foothold in Europe ahead of the
creation of the single European market in 1992, while offering ICL
security for the future, analysts said.
   STC, formerly known as Standard Telephones and Cables, confirmed
the negotiations after Fujitsu President Tadashi Sekizawa said
earlier in Tokyo that his company was considering purchasing an
interest in ICL, but that ``nothing has been decided yet.''
   Newspaper reports in Britain and Japan have said Fujitsu would
acquire 50 percent to 60 percent of ICL's equity for about 650
million pounds, or about $1.2 billion.
   ICL is worth about 1.2 billion pounds, or $2.2 billion, analysts
estimate.
   There have been rumors for a year about a possible equity tie
between ICL and Fujitsu, which already have technology links,
London analysts said.
   But analysts said they were surprised that STC might sell a
controlling stake to the Japanese company. Such a deal could
inflame nationalist sentiment, which frequently meets foreign bids
in Britain.
   ``This is a significant event,'' said Andrew Harrington, an
analyst at the London investment firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
   ICL is the most profitable computer company of its kind in
Europe, analysts said. It makes mainframe computers mostly for the
British market.
   Fujitsu's major activity in Europe is selling semiconductor
computer chips, although it makes office computers in Spain, and
semiconductors in Ireland. It has marketing and development arms in
Britain, West Germany, and the Netherlands.
   ICL uses Fujitsu's computer chips and disks. Given those ties,
Fujitsu is the only company that could take control of ICL, said an
analyst who requested anonymity.
   ``They are the brains in ICL's mainframe computers,'' she said.
``Technologically, they are vital to the future of ICL.''
   STC Chairman Alan Walsh said earlier this year that his company
was looking for a partner to help carry the burden of heavy
research and development costs associated with the rapidly changing
computer industry.
   ICL's operating profit increased 13 percent to 146 million
pounds, or $266 million, from 129 million pounds, or $235 million,
last year. Its sales were up 18 percent to 1.61 billion pounds,
$2.9 billion, from 1.36 billion pounds, or $2.5 billion. STC said
after-tax profit figures were not available.
   Despite ICL's healthy 1989 performance, STC issued a profit
warning in June. The parent company said it anticipated a sluggish
market due to launch costs of new ICL products and key customers
deferring capital purchases.

<HEAD>Industrial Production Plummets; 30,000 More Lose Jobs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German industrial production plunged by
15 percent in June and half a million workers have had their hours
and wages slashed in the past two weeks, the government said today.
   More than 700,000 workers now have either lost their jobs or
faced sharp cuts in their salaries because of the country's quick
move to a free market, the government said.
   Lawmakers debated how to keep financing the country until
unification with West Germany, as more than 2,000 uniformed police
officers demonstrated outside the Parliament to demand better wages.
   About 500,000 East German workers have had their hours reduced
since July 1, when the nation merged its economy with West
Germany's in a step to full unification, said East Germany's labor
minister, Regine Hildebrandt.
   Under a program financed by West Germany, workers who normally
would be targeted for layoffs are being paid about 60 percent of
their salaries to remain in the factories, where they are to
receive training for other jobs.
   On Wednesday, the government announced that unemployment was at
223,876, about 2.7 percent of the 8 million East German workers.
That was up from 30,000 jobless in March.
   Together, the number of workers who have either lost their jobs
or are in the subsidized jobs program is nearly 724,000, or about 9
percent of the work force.
   The government statistics office announced today that production
was down 15.1 percent in June from the same time a year earlier,
and down 7.3 percent during the first six months of this year
compared with the same period last year.
   Economists say unemployment could reach 3 million within a year
as uncompetitive East German companies go bankrupt, unable to make
the adjustment from a centrally planned ecomomy to a free market.
   On Tuesday, the government said 2,400 of the country's 8,000
companies _ 30 percent _ are unable to pay their bills.
   The two Germanys joined their economies and monetary systems on
July 1 and are expected to merge into one nation by the end of the
year.
   Arno Donda, statistics office chief, also said that living costs
for East Germans rose 12.1 percent in June compared to June 1989.
   The figure does not cover the economic union that began July 1,
when East Germany's borders were opened to Western products and
many prices for basic necessities skyrocketed.
   About 2,500 East German police demonstrated in front of the
Parliament building to demand job security and better wages to keep
up with higher living costs. They also said they need more money
for their expanded duties, including dealing with rising crime.
   The East Berlin newspaper Berliner Zeitung reported today that
crime has risen since East Germany threw off its Communist
government last fall, embraced democracy and opened its borders to
the West.
   About 130,000 robberies, break-ins and larcenies were reported
from January to June, a 6.2 percent increase from the same period
in the previous year.

   The stock market gave ground today, weighed down
by earnings disappointments at several high-technology companies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.21 to 2,978.47
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 375 up, 585 down and
496 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.47 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The day's most conspicuous losers were concentrated in
over-the-counter technology issues with wide followings in the
financial world.
   Lotus Development tumbled 6{ to 24}. On Wednesday the company
posted strong earnings, as expected, for the second quarter, but
said its third-quarter profits might fall short of comparable
year-ago levels.
   Apple Computer dropped 3&rsqb; to 41\ after the company also warned
that its earnings for the current quarter might show a decline.
   Ashton-Tate, which reported an unexpectedly wide loss for the
second quarter, tumbled 1&rsqb; to 9.
   Given that kind of turbulence, analysts said it wasn't
surprising that the market as a whole experienced a bumpy ride.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.30 to 198.53. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .63 at 361.43.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.07 to
2,981.68.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 469 up, 1.012 down and 546 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 168.76 million shares, against 176.79
million in the previous session.

   Supporters of federal crop insurance for
farmers are looking for ways to save the program, despite
elimination of its funding for fiscal 1991 by the House.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., assailed the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee for cutting the program's money from the
$50.35 billion agriculture spending bill that the House approved,
335-86, Wednesday.
   He said the action by Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., posed ``a
direct threat to the economic well being of farmers of this
nation.''
   But neither English, who chairs the House Agriculture
subcommittee studying ways to improve crop insurance, nor any other
proponents tried to amend the bill on the floor.
   Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, said
he thought farmers would get the wrong signal from the bill.
   ``Crop insurance has become a tool of the new farming era,''
said de la Garza. He said many farmers can't get loans to do their
planting without the insurance.
   Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill., ranking Republican on the
Agriculture Committee, said crop insurance would be saved somehow.
   ``In the farm bill, we can do something to offset what Whitten
has done,'' he said. ``It would be easier than to fight with him on
the floor.''
   He also indicated that the appropriations bill might be adjusted
by the Senate to reinstate crop insurance.
   The Appropriations Committee cut the amount available to the
crop insurance program by $337 million and instructed the
Agriculture Department not to sell any new policies after Sept. 10.
A total $262 million was appropriated for phase-out costs and to
make payments on policies that are being written now and until the
cut-off date.
   The Bush administration also opposes the program and has said
$601 million would be needed in 1991 to operate at the current
level. Spending for 1990 has been $400 million.
   The alternative to crop insurance is straight-out disaster
payments, which Congress has regularly made when multi-state
weather problems cause extensive crop losses.
   Only about 40 percent of the eligible farmers are participating
in the insurance program. Farmers who don't buy it say its premiums
are too high, yields are inadequate and price forecasting for
certain crops by insurance companies is inaccurate.
   Insurance policies can be purchased through private companies or
the federal government. Thirty percent of all costs are paid for by
the government.
   Whitten objected to the program as unsuccessful and costly.
   ``We have a long record of trying to work out an actuarially
sound crop insuranc program,'' he said. ``I don't know if that can
be done or not. ... The big money goes to those engaged in the
insurance business.''
   Whitten's stronginterest in agriculture and his 41-year tenure
as chairman of the agriculture appropriations subcommittee has made
him a powerful force in American farming whose wishes are not
easily challenged.
   Five efforts to cut his bill's spending across the board were
defeated. Debate over one of them, offered by Republicans to rib
the Democrats, degenerated into partisan accusations about the
federal deficit.
   Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., sought an amendment to cut $19.90 frm
the bill after four others that would have skimmed 2 percent to 9.5
percent from all programs covered by the legislation were defeated.
   Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., acknowledged that the Walker
amendment was a joke offered in reaction to House defeat Tuesday of
a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
   Walker said: ``If in 1990, we can cut $19.90, then next year we
can muster the courage to go to $19.91.''
   The comments led Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., to charge that the
Republicans caused the deficit problems.
   ``When poor, old, beleaguered Jimmy Carter left office the
national debt was $932 billion,'' said Obey. ``The national debt
today is $3.38 trillion. It has been tripled because this Congress
gutlessly and spinelessly followed the policies of the Reagan
administration and its successor.''
   The overall agriculture appropriation for fiscal 1991, which
begins Oct. 1, is $5.2 billion more than this year's funding, but
$86.5 million less than requested by the administration.
   ``I just can't understand the efforts to cut,'' said Whitten.
``I get asked about the balanced budget. I advise that I believe in
the balanced budget, but not at the expense of sound programs that
are absolutely essential to the well-being of the American people.''
   The measure provides money for the Agriculture Department
administrative operations, research projects, price supports, rural
development, domestic food assistance and international programs.
The bill also funds the Food and Drug Administration and Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.

<HEAD>Textron Earnings Improve 21 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textron Inc. reported today that its net
income in the second quarter improved 21.5 percent to $72.1 million.
   The company said the earnings, which amount to 80 cents per
share, had improved from the $59.3 million, or 67 cents per share,
it earned from April through June 1989. Last year's second quarter
included an extraordinary loss of $9.5 million.
   Revenue rose during the three months this year to $2 billion
from $1.8 billion.
   B.F. Dolan, chairman and chief executive officer, credited the
company's financial services subsidiaries for the improvement.
Among its aerospace technology companies, its systems segment
increased earnings significantly, but other divisions, particularly
helicopters, had poor results.
   Systems earned $17.9 million, up from $5 million. But
helicopters earnings declined to $27 million from $34.7 million,
largely because Bell Helicopter had a ``less favorable mix of
non-U.S. government sales,'' Dolan said.
   For the first six months, Textron's net income improved 12.8
percent to $138.3 million, or $1.53 per share, on revenue of $3.9
billion. For the first half of 1989, income was $122.6 million, or
$1.40 per share, on $3.7 billion in revenue.
   Textron's commercial products sector included dividends of $6.5
million from Avdel for the first half of the year. But interest
expense on borrowing related to the purchase of the company
amounted to $10.6 million, wiping out the dividend.
   The Federal Trade Commission has obtained a preliminary
injunction barring Textron from acquiring Avdel because of concerns
over competition.

   The United Auto Workers union will press
automakers for better job-protection guarantees than they agreed to
in 1987, UAW President Owen Bieber says.
   Since the current agreements with the Big Three were signed, two
of the companies have halted production at six assembly plants,
putting about 17,000 people out of work.
   Those closings, what the companies call ``indefinite idlings,''
are among the reasons the union has tapped job security as its No.
1 priority in this summer's negotiations with General Motors Corp.,
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
   As talks opened this morning at Ford, company Vice President
Peter Pestillo reached across the bargaining table with two fingers
bandaged to shake hands with Bieber.
   Pestillo pleaded with the 6-foot-5, 250-pound Bieber to squeeze
lightly, explaining his dog was hit by a car and the animal bit
Pestillo when he went to its aid. He didn't say how the dog was
before reporters were ushered from the room to allow talks to begin.
   Talks started Wednesday at GM and get under way Friday at
Chrysler.
   The contracts cover more than 450,000 active workers and nearly
as many retirees.
   All three contracts expire at midnight, Sept. 14. It's the first
time that's happened in 11 years.
   Besides job security, the union will seek recalls for laid off
workers, wage and pension improvements, more accountability from
management and a linking of executives' bonus payments to
profit-sharing awards for hourly workers.
   The companies are expected to press for increased flexibility in
work assignments and a variety of cost-reduction issues, including
health-care, which is likely to take up a good deal of bargaining
time.
   After a brief preliminary meeting between the full company and
union bargaining committees at the GM Building on Wednesday, Bieber
sharply criticized the huge automaker for ``performing the cynical,
semantic maneuver represented by the term `idling' plants.''
   ``We told the corporation that disappointment is far too mild a
word to describe our feelings about how they perceived their job
security commitments they made to us three years ago,'' he said.
   GM's chief negotiator, Vice President Alfred Warren Jr.,
declined to get into a discussion about specific issues likely to
command time at the main bargaining table or in smaller,
issue-oriented subcommittees.
   However, he referred frequently to GM's need to cut costs,
especially in its component operations.
   ``We must find innovative and cost-effective ways to become more
competitive in component manufacturing,'' he said.
   GM has about 40 percent of its 280,000 active, UAW-covered
employees working in component plants, which make, for example,
air-conditioning systems, radios and transmissions. GM makes more
of the components that go into its cars and trucks than do Ford or
Chrysler, and it sells components to other manufacturers.
   Warren declined to say how GM thought it could become more
competitive with other component manufacturers, but said
competition dictated that it must.
   Each of the Big Three have said the age of their work forces, at
an average of about 42 years, coupled with UAW-negotiated
health-care provisions, boost the price of each car.
   Warren said company provided health-care benefits add $622 to
the cost of every car and truck GM sells. Such costs for Japanese
companies making vehicles in the United States, with an average
worker age of younger than 30, are between $50 and $100.
   One of the most emotional issues on the UAW side of the talks is
cost-of-living protection for retirees.
   At a demonstration outside the GM Building on Wednesday, about
2,000 protesters sought a contract provision linking pension
payments to inflation.
   Such a proposal, the company and union have said, could cost
billions of dollars, perhaps more than the rest of a contract
combined.
   It's more likely that the two sides can reach agreements on
lump-sum payments to retirees rather than tying pension boosts to
increases in the inflation rate.

<HEAD>As Expected, AT&amp;T Reports Lower Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. today
reported its second-quarter earnings fell 6.4 percent due to lower
equipment sales and unexpectedly high startup costs for the
company's new credit card.
   AT&amp;T warned of an expected drop in earnings in an unusual
announcement three weeks ago, but it did not say how much it would
be.
   AT&amp;T said it earned $657 million, or 60 cents a share, in the
quarter ended June 30, down from $699 million, or 65 cents a share,
in the same quarter of 1989.
   Revenue also fell, to $9.03 billion from $9.26 billion in the
same quarter of last year.
   The company said the disappointing results were due mostly to
slower sales of corporate telephone systems, data communications
gear and equipment sold to the federal government, as well as
unexpectedly high costs for processing applications for its
Universal card, which combines a MasterCard or Visa with telephone
charging privileges.
   AT&amp;T blamed the lower equipment sales on a sluggish economy,
while it said the Universal card proved far more popular than it
expected.
   It also said its long-distance revenue was down in the quarter
due to less favorable access charge settlements with local phone
companies and customer shifts to lower-cost AT&amp;T services.
   ``We still expect 1990 to be better than 1989, a record earnings
year,'' said Chairman Robert E. Allen. ``These results do not alter
our confidence in our direction or our future prospects.''
   For the first six months of the year, AT&amp;T earned $1.325
billion, or $1.22 per share, up from $1.293 billion, or $1.20 a
share. Revenue totaled $17.9 billion, virtually unchanged from the
same period of 1989.
   AT&amp;T's announcement last month of expected lower earnings sent
its stock price tumbling. AT&amp;T is the nation's most widely held
stock.
   In early trading today, AT&amp;T shares were off 25 cents at $36.87{.

<HEAD>Earnings Dip, Reflecting Costs of Great Northern Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. said today its second
quarter earnings were down 38 percent from a year ago, reflecting
the costs involved in its recent $5 billion takeover of Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp.
   Earnings for the three months ended June 30 were $107 million,
or $1.25 a share, down from $172 million, or $1.90 a share, in
1989's second quarter. The recent three-month period was the first
full quarter in which the two corporations were combined.
   The rival paper products companies agreed to merge in February,
ending nearly four months of resistance by Connecticut-based Great
Northern.
   Georgia-Pacific's sales for the quarter were $3.5 billion, up
from $2.6 billion in the second 1989 quarter, but the increase was
offset by takeover-related interest expenses, the company said.
   Interest expenses for the quarter were $185 million, up from $66
million a year ago.
   In the earnings report released today, Georgia-Pacific Chairman
T. Marshall Hahn Jr. stressed the sales gains.
   ``The company's building products business has experienced a
record second quarter,'' he said, noting that despite a decline in
housing starts the company has benefited from an increased demand
for materials used in the remodeling and repair market.
   Prices for the company's forestry products are up also because
of a diminishing supply of timber in the Northwest, he said.
   The company's pulp and paper divisions have shown gains mainly
because of demand for communication papers, Hahn said.
   For the six months ended June 30, Georgia-Pacific's net income
was $208 million, or $2.43 per share, down 36 percent from $326
million, or $3.55 a share, for the first half of 1989.
   Six-month net sales were $6.2 billion, up from $5.1 billion
during the same period a year earlier.

<HEAD>Government Holding Big Closeout on Businesses From Airline to
Phone Co.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Argentina placed a classified
ad, here's how it might look: Buyers wanted for used planes,
trains, roads, power plants and a phone company. For information,
contact President Carlos Menem.
   Dozens of inefficient businesses, industries and monopolies
created by the government or nationalized decades ago are now up
for grabs in what amounts to a large-scale closeout sale. They're
worth many billions of dollars.
   In late June, the government peddled a majority stake in the
telephone company ENTel, leased more than 6,000 miles of federal
highways and granted foreign companies access to potentially rich
oil fields. Other items on the for-sale agenda range from radio
stations to gambling casinos.
   Under Menem, the reform-minded leader who took office a year
ago, the state-run bureacracy that has dominated Argentina's
economy since the 1940s is redefining its role, and stepping back.
   The main reason is that the once prosperous South American
nation is undergoing recession, high unemployment and triple-digit
inflation all at the same time. Its foreign debt of $66 billion is
third-highest in the developing world. The government is bankrupt.
   ``Argentina is not well. Argentina is broken,'' Menem said when
inaugurated last July. ``At this historic time begins the
reconstruction.''
   As he said little about it in his campaign, few Argentines
suspected Menem had in mind selling companies taken over by his
party's founder, Juan Domingo Peron, beginning in the 1940s.
   But Menem concluded the entities that once were an economic
engine had become an anchor, which he is trying to cut loose.
   Oil production stagnated in the 1980s because the state company
YPF lacked money and technology. Promising areas were never
explored. Potentially an exporter, Argentina barely produces enough
for domestic needs.
   One-third of the state highway system of 14,670 miles is in
marginal shape or worse, government assessments show. Private
studies say half the roads need basic repairs.
   Forty percent of the locomotives are out of service at any given
time, the state train company Ferrocarriles Argentinos admits.
Nearly half the track is so worn that train engineers creep over it
slowly to avoid derailment.
   Argentines wait years to get a new telephone line only to find
it's impossible to call another city because of jammed circuits.
   Within Buenos Aires, calls frequently are misdirected, callers
often cannot hear each other and sometimes they don't get a dial
tone. ``The system is in collapse,'' said ENTel director Maria
Julia Alsogaray.
   By all accounts, state-run companies are poorly managed,
overstaffed and strangled in bureaucracy and petty corruption.
Strikers often shut them down.
   Fares go uncollected on state trains. Employees of the state
water and electricity companies get service at a discount.
Politicians receive free tickets on the state airline.
   The 13 biggest state-run companies, which ring up huge debts
among themselves, lost nearly $4 billion in 1989, enough to pay off
a sizable chunk of foreign debt.
   Buenos Aires, once known as one of the loveliest and most
sophisticated capitals, is getting a reputation for Third World
deprivation. The city of 10 million rationed energy last year when
drought shriveled production at already-overburdened hydroelectric
complexes.
   Among other problems, labor unions are intransigent, courts are
too overworked to adequately enforce contracts, and markets are so
volatile that currency and interest rates seesaw daily.
   So who would want to buy Argentina's companies? Surprisingly,
bidders abound.
   Bell Atlantic Corp. of the United States and Telefonica of Spain
bought a controlling stake of ENTel by offering $214 million cash
and $5 billion in debt securities. They hope new investment and
tighter accounting will pay off. The government will sell the
balance of the company later this year.
   About 50 Argentine and foreign companies agreed to improve
nearly 6,200 miles of federal highways in return for the right to
charge tolls.
   The state carrier Aerolineas Argentinas fetched $260 million
cash and $2 billion in assumed debt _ both higher than the
government expected _ when it was put to bid. Iberia, Spain's state
airline, is expected to take formal ownership later this year.
   For Menem, privatizations are a political gamble. Organized
labor helped elect him and now opposes his sell-everything policy.
Even allies in the Peronist party aren't too happy.
   Businesses executives clamor for the state subsidies Menem
curtailed, and resent the tariff reductions and free-market
currency exchange rate that push them to compete more aggressively
with overseas producers. Provincial governors want federal revenue
sharing increased.
   Menem, however, views economic austerity and free market
orientation as the only way Argentina might regain the prosperity
it had through the 1940s, based on the export of beef and grain. In
his view, the last thing Argentina needs are dinosaur-like
money-losers.
   By selling ENTel, for example, the government will save hundreds
of millions of dollars in interest payments on the company's debt.
It also won't have to absorb ENTel's staggering losses, which
totaled $250 million last year.
   Moreover, terms of the sale call for the investment of several
hundred million dollars within two years that the government could
hardly have afforded. Jobs will be saved and services improved,
Menem contends.
   In the energy sector, $4 billion in private funds will be
invested in oil, natural gas and petrochemical projects in the next
four years, energy undersecretary Julio Araoz has projected.

   The stock market declined broadly today, weighed
down by earnings disappointments at several high-technology
companies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.63 to
2,970.05 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 379 up, 859
down and 490 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 53.19 million shares at
midmorning.
   The day's most conspicuous losers were concentrated in
technology issues with wide followings in the financial world.
   Tandem Computers, the most active NYSE issue, dropped 2{ to 19.
Tandem reported profits for the fiscal quarter ended June 30 of 30
cents a share, against 31 cents in the like period a year earlier.
   Lotus Development was the volume leader in the over-the-counter
market, down 6~ at 24&rsqb;. On Wednesday the company posted strong
earnings, as expected, for the second quarter, but said its
third-quarter profits might fall short of comparable year-ago
levels.
   Apple Computer dropped 3 to 41| after the company also warned
that its earnings for the current quarter might show a decline.
   Ashton-Tate, which reported an unexpectedly wide loss for the
second quarter, tumbled 1&rsqb; to 9.
   Given that kind of turbulence, analysts said it wasn't
surprising that the market as a whole experienced a bumpy ride.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.81 to 198.02. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.02 at 361.04.

   Sharply lower sales during the past
three months cut Hasbro Inc.'s second-quarter profit nearly 52
percent from the comparable period a year earlier, the company
reported today.
   The Pawtucket-based toy maker earned $8.7 million, or 15 cents
per share, from April through June this year, compared to $18.1
million, or 31 cents per share, during the same three months of
1989.
   That was because of dismal revenue of about $277.3 million
during this year's second quarter, down 7.8 percent from the year
earlier's $301.3 million.
   Some expenses also rose this year, contributing to the poor
results. Those expenses included such things as research and
product development, the cost of sales and distribution and
administration.
   Hasbro blamed the poor performance on slow domestic sales.
``While our European units are enjoying continued strong levels of
revenues and earnings, both in U.S. dollars and their local
currencies, our domestic units have not fared as well,'' Alan G.
Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a
statement.
   The company is banking on improvements during the third quarter,
primarily because of the planned introductions of two new products.
Those are dolls based on the pop music group New Kids on the Block
and on performers affiliated with the World Wrestling Federation.
   ``If anticipated improvements in customer order trends in the
second half of the year occur and there is a positive response to
new promotionsl products being shipped in the third quarter, we
believe 1990 full-year results will approximate those of 1989,''
Hassenfeld said.
   For the first six months of this year, earnings plummetted 23.6
percent to $28.2 million, or 48 cents per share, from $36.9
million, or 63 cents per share. That was based on revenue of $578.4
million for the first half of this year, compared to $589.7 million
last year.
   Hasbro's announcement of its poor performance comes on the heels
of a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in which a shareholder
complained that the company hid its declining sales to prop up its
stock price.
   Frederic Braunschweiger, who filed his suit in Providence, said
Hasbro executives knew that orders from retailers were down from
1989 and that the company's market share was dropping quickly, but
did not acknowledge that publicly until Hassenfeld told the Dow
Jones New Service in an interview late last month.
   If Hasbro had disclosed its problems earlier, investors would
not have bought Hasbro stock ``at the artificially inflated prices
that they did,'' Braunschweiger charged in court documents.

<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. today reported its
second-quarter profit plunged and that it had a net loss per common
share after paying preferred stock dividends.
   The nation's third-largest computer company blamed the results
in part on weak domestic sales.
   Unisys said it earned $11.8 million, down from $53.6 million in
the second quarter of 1989.
   After allowing for the mandatory preferred dividends, the
company had a loss per common share of 9 cents, compared with
per-share earnings of 17 cents in the year-ago quarter.
   Revenue totaled $2.47 billion, down from $2.57 billion for the
second quarter of 1989. That quarter benefited significantly from
the initial volume shipment of the company's new 2200 Series
mainframe computers, the company said.
   Unisys stock was up 12{ cents a share at $12.75 this morning in
New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Unisys said its worldwide orders posted a slight gain in the
quarter as defense systems orders rebounded from depressed levels a
year earlier. Gains in international commercial computer orders
were offset by continued weakness in U.S. orders.
   The quarterly comparison was hurt by last year's strong 2200
Series sales, particularly abroad, Unisys said.
   James A. Unruh, Unisys' president and chief executive officer,
said the company was making gradual but steady progress in
improving its business operations and financial structure.
   The company reduced its debt by $265 million in the quarter.
Unruh said Unisys made ``significant progress'' toward its goal of
reducing its debt by $600 million to $800 million during 1990.
   For the first six months of the year, Unisys said it earned $8.6
million on revenue of $4.8 billion, compared with a loss of $25.1
million on virtually identical revenue a year ago. The company
reported a per-share loss of 28 cents in this year's first six
months, compared with a loss per share of 50 cents in the year-ago
period.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced
by gains in the soybean complex.
   Analysts said soybean prices have fallen low enough over the
past two weeks to stimulate new export demand, and trading on the
European soybean meal market has grown more active in recent days.
   But the early gains were limited by beneficial crop weather.
Showers and cooler temperatures were expected to spread across the
Corn Belt tonight and tomorrow.
   A new National Weather Service forecast for mild, rainy weather
next week in the Midwest held no threat of heat stress to the corn
crop, which is moving through its critical pollination phase.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 1} cents higher
with the contract for delivery in July at $3.01{ a bushel; corn
futures were \ cent to 1 cent higher with July at $2.72} a bushel;
oats were \ cent to } cent higher with September at $1.23 a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent to 4{ cents higher with July at $6.02{ a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures fell in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Pork futures were down sharply with near-term
pork bellly contracts down the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a
pound.
   Live cattle futures were .05 cent to .22 cent lower with August
at 76.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .27 cent
lower with August at 87.12 cents a pound; live hogs were .23 cent
to .90 cent lower with July at 63.72 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .90 cent to 2 cents lower with July at 46.50 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures advanced on Wednesday; pork futures were mostly
lower.

<HEAD>Budding Business: Items That Clean the Wax Off Your Produce</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE ZGANJAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The typical cucumber is so caked with wax
you could add a wick and almost call it a candle.
   But it's waxed foods that catch the eye of even the savviest
shopper who will meticulously pick through produce for that
picture-pretty item, leaving the duller _ but perhaps healthier _
alternative behind.
   The wax itself isn't harmful. What concerns people are
pesticides and fungicides found in the wax.
   Some businesses have capitalized on this fear, developing scrub
products they claim will remove waxes and other chemicals from the
surface of fruits and vegetables.
   ``I was cleaning my produce at the kitchen sink using water when
it dawned on me that if I'm going to invest my time washing, I
should at least be doing a thorough job,'' said Steve Abo,
president of a Los Angeles company that markets a produce wash in
spray bottles.
   Many consumers know that apples, like cucumbers, get much of
their luster from wax. What they may not realize is how many fresh
produce items are coated with wax _ oranges, grapefruits, avocados,
bananas, beets, watermelons, pineapples, eggplants, peaches,
peppers, squash, garlic, onion, potatoes, tomatoes and turnips.
   Even if there is no sheen, a fruit or vegetable could still be
covered. Wax is now applied in such a thin film that it's hard to
tell just by looking. About 10,000 apples can be coated with a
single ounce.
   The wax replaces natural coatings removed by scrubs and
detergent washes between picking and packing. It keeps food from
losing moisture and spoiling.
   What's troubling is that fungicides _ some considered possible
causes of cancer _ are encased in the wax, said Beth Kaufman of the
Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest.
   ``Consumers look for the prettiest vegetable or fruit, which is
usually waxed,'' Kaufman said. ``Consumers have to let producers
know they're more concerned about the food than just how it looks.''
   Abo, who grew up on avocado and lemon farms in California and
Arizona, said his product removes chemicals that don't wash off
with water alone. He won't disclose what's in his spray, except to
say the ingredients are non-toxic.
   Another company, Bio Scrub Industries near Albany, N.Y., is
planning to market a ``veggy fruit scrub brush'' which claims to
remove surface wax, soil, chemicals and pesticides.
   The product is a soft-bristle brush that emits a liquid
containing purified water and cleaning agents. It will be sold
through mail-order catalogs and cost $8.45 per three-pack, said
company president Mark Sterman.
   Consumer groups are skeptical. The Center for Science in the
Public Interest, for example, said the ingredients in these washes
look suspiciously like those in ordinary dishwashing detergent.
   ``We're not convinced that specialty scrubs are any better than
plain old detergent, and they can cost up to eight times more,''
said Lisa Lefferts, a staff scientist at the center.
   Lefferts questioned whether these products will even remove wax,
as many claim.
   Abo, a biochemist, said he understands the center's position.
   ``I think their angle is that there's a lot of entrepreneurs
putting detergent in bottles, diluting it and selling it,'' he said.
   The Food and Drug Administration says fungicides approved for
use with waxes are safe within certain limits.
   But among those approved by the FDA is Benomyl, considered a
possible carcinogen in humans. Also included is ortho-phenylphenol,
an immune-system suppressant, and sodium ortho-phenyl phenate,
another possible carcinogen.
   Food-coloring agents may be added, a common practice for Florida
oranges which are often picked green. Some waxes are made with
animal lard.
   Critics question the safety of fungicides, particularly in
combination with wax, which keeps them bound to food.
   ``While there is no reason to believe that waxes pose a health
risk to humans, there is reason to be concerned about the
pesticides that are often mixed with waxes. A number of fungicides
that are added to waxes have been shown to cause increased risk of
some diseases, including cancer,'' says ``The Wax Cover-Up,'' a
report issued this spring by the Center for Science in the Public
Interest.
   For more than 50 years, federal law has required that shipping
cartons and store labels disclose when wax is used. Another federal
law adopted in the 1950s also requires disclosure of post-harvest
pesticides.
   Critics say these laws aren't strictly followed and in some
cases are ignored, because the federal government relies on state
inspectors to enforce them. But some states are enacting their own
tough labeling laws.
   Maine requires food retailers to post signs informing consumers
that its produce may have been treated with chemicals. The New
Hampshire legislature has passed a bill requiring labeling of
produce coated with wax. Similar legislation is pending in
Illinois, Tennessee and New York.
   Efforts for tighter enforcement have upset growers, however. The
United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, for example, said
labeling waxed produce is nearly impossible.
   The group said different shipments of the same item, which may
be coated with different wax ingredients, are often mixed together
on supermarket shelves. The association, which represents producers
nationwide, said keeping the differently treated items separate is
difficult.
   Health experts say consumers should scrub produce to remove
residues and coatings. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association
recommends using a vegetable brush, hot water and detergent.
   Removing the peel will reduce exposure to wax and fungicide
coatings. But it's a tradeoff since the peel contains fiber which
may help reduce the risk of cancer.
   Health experts say organic fruits and vegetables are grown and
treated without the use of synthetic chemicals and wax coatings are
not applied.

<HEAD>American Express Reports Flat Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co. reported Thursday its
results were virtually flat in the second quarter as gains in its
charge card and travelers check business were partially offset by a
profit decline at its Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. brokerage
subsidiary.
   The financial services company said it earned $319.6 million, or
73 cents per share, up 1.1 percent from $316.1 million, or 73 cents
per share, in the second quarter of 1989.
   Revenue fell to $6.06 billion from $6.36 billion a year earlier,
reflecting a drop in Shearson's revenue to $2.62 billion from $3.29
billion.
   American Express said its results reflected the costs of
purchasing $750 million in preferred stock from Shearson at the end
of the first quarter.
   American Express, which currently owns about 60 percent of
Shearson, plans to take full control of its subsidiary and issue
25.4 million new shares to finance the transaction. Stockholders
will vote on the plan next month.
   Shearson reported $51 million in earnings, down from $55 million
a year earlier. American Express said its share of Shearson's
earnings was $26.5 million, down from $33.8 million last year.
   American Express has pumped $1 billion in capital into the
struggling division in recent months and ordered a restructuring
that included about 2,000 layoffs. Shearson is reorganizing its
corporate structure, combining four divisions into two and plans to
rename itself Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   American Express' standout division in the second quarter was
its Travel Related Services division, which includes the firm's
charge card and travelers check business. The division posted a
16.3 percent rise in earnings, to $249.2 million from $214.2
million a year earlier.
   Earnings at American Express Bank, which generally operates
outside the United States, fell 10.5 percent to $31.7 million from
$35.4 million a year earlier. The division suffered a $7 million
drop in earnings from its lesser developed country activities, a
business from which American Express is withdrawing.
   The company's IDS Financial Services division, a financial
planning business, reported a 20.6 percent earnings gain to $51.6
million from $42.8 million.
   American Express' Information Services Co. recorded a 25.3
percent earnings gain to $21.9 million from $17.4 million.
   For the first six months of the year, American Express said it
lost $300.2 million, or 75 cents per share, compared with earnings
of $568 million, or $1.32 per share, in the first half of 1989.
   This year's first-half results include a $915 million loss at
Shearson.
   First-half revenue fell to $11.97 billion from $12.22 billion in
the same period last year.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralston Purina Co. on Thursday reported a 9
percent quarterly profit gain, reflecting lower costs for pet and
human food ingredients combined with higher sales of cereals and
strength in baked goods.
   The company earned $92.4 million, or $1.55 a share, in its third
quarter, up from $83.8 million, or $1.27 a share, in the
corresponding 1989 quarter.
   For the three months ended June 30, the St. Louis-based company
had sales of $1.71 billion, up 5 percent from $1.62 billion for the
same 1989 period.
   Company spokesman Pat Farrell said the increase stemmed largely
from lower ingredient costs for pet and human foods, higher sales
of cereal and bigger profits in baked goods.
   Ralston Purina is a leading maker of pet food and cereal. The
company also makes Eveready and Energizer batteries and owns
Continetal Baking Co., which makes such well-known products as
Wonder bread and Hostess Twinkies.
   Farrell said profits declined at Eveready Battery in the third
quarter primarily because of lower sales and heavy discounting.
   The company also noted in the second quarter report that it was
increasing its stock repurchase program.
   In March, the company announced a plan to buy up to 2 million
shares of its common stock and now says it's authorized to buy an
additional 521,000 shares.
   For the first nine months of the year, the company reported
income of $314.3 million, or $5.08 a share, compared with $377.3
million, or $5.75 a share, for the same period a year earlier.
   The decrease was a result of the absence of profits from the
discontinued Van Camp Seafood operations, which Ralston sold last
year.
   Sales for the first nine months were $5.31 billion, up from
$4.89 billion for the same period last year.

   The stock market showed a broad loss today,
weighed down by earnings disappointments at several high-technology
companies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 18.07 points on
Wednesday, dropped another 23.02 to 2,958.66 by noontime on Wall

   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 363 up, 989
down and 469 unchanged.
   The day's most conspicuous losers were concentrated in
technology issues with wide followings in the financial world.
   Tandem Computers, the most active NYSE issue, dropped 2| to 18~.
Tandem reported profits for the fiscal quarter ended June 30 of 30
cents a share, against 31 cents in the like period a year earlier.
   Lotus Development was the volume leader in the over-the-counter
market, down 6{ at 24}. On Wednesday the company posted strong
earnings, as expected, for the second quarter, but said its
third-quarter profits might fall short of comparable year-ago

   Apple Computer dropped 2~ to 41} after the company also warned
that its earnings for the current quarter might show a decline.
   Ashton-Tate, which reported an unexpectedly wide loss for the
second quarter, tumbled 1&rsqb; to 9.
   Given that kind of turbulence, analysts said it wasn't
surprising that the market as a whole experienced a bumpy ride.

1.40 to 197.43. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.89 at 360.17.

<HEAD>Stotler Announces Investor Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A financially strapped commodity brokerage headed
by Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said today it
has tentatively accepted an investor's offer to buy a substantial
stake in the company.
   The brokerage, Stotler and Co., also confirmed that it had
brought itself into compliance with the federal government's
minimum capital requirements.
   The developments mean Stotler could avert a cash-flow crisis and
will avoid restrictions on its brokerage operations while sparing
Mahlmann further embarrassment.
   Stotler's parent company, Chicago-based Stotler Group Inc., made
the announcements in a one-page statement. Stotler and Co., an
old-line grain-trading firm, is Stotler Group's principal
subsidiary.
   Stotler Group did not identify the prospective investor or the
size of the stake the party would buy in the parent company.
   The statement said the offer was subject to approval by the
investor's board of directors. The offer would terminate if such
approval is not granted by 11 a.m. EDT Monday, Stotler Group said.
   Stotler Group confirmed Wednesday's Board of Trade announcement
that it had brought itself into compliance with the minimum capital
requirements of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   In a three-paragraph statement released late Wednesday, the
Board of Trade said Stotler had given the exchange a plan last week
for meeting a CFTC requirement that futures brokerages maintain in
a separate account liquid assets equal to 4 percent of customer
funds.
   ``The exchange believes the firm has achieved the requisite
capital requirements,'' the exchange said.
   ``They have at all times during this period had more than enough
in segregated liquid assets to cover all customer segregated fund
obligations and the exchange is continuing to monitor the
compliance status of Stotler and all other member firms,'' the
statement concluded.
   Board of Trade spokesman Michael O'Connell said he could not
elaborate on the statement.
   Officials at Stotler and its parent company, Stotler Group Inc.,
did not return telephone calls.
   The exchange ordered Stotler on Monday to boost its capital to
the required level by the close of business Wednesday or face
restrictions on its trading activities.
   The parent company said Stotler would try to meet the capital
requirement by both reducing the size of its business and seeking
outside financial help, without which it said Stotler might have
trouble meeting its debt obligations.
   The exchange can force a brokerage out of the business of
trading for customers if the capital level falls below 4 percent of
customer funds.
   Stotler Group's stock, which trades on the American Stock
Exchange, closed unchanged at $5.62{ Wednesday.
   Stotler's capital problems are seen as a major embarrassment to
Mahlmann, now in his fourth consecutive one-year term as chairman
of the world's largest commodity futures exchange.
   Mahlmann has said he has not been involved in Stotler's
day-to-day operations for several years.
   People in the commodities business said Wednesday that some of
Stotler's customers were liquidating their accounts Wednesday and
others were transferring to other brokerages. But they couldn't
provide specifics.
   ``We don't see any of that on the floor because it's all done in
the back offices, but it is going on,'' said John Frazier, director
of agricultural trading for Gerald Inc., a commodity brokerage.
   Stotler, one of the country's 10 largest commodity brokerages,
is an old-line firm with its roots in the grain business. The
company also trades financial futures, which have outstripped
agricultural commodities in trading volume in recent years.

Revenue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colgate-Palmolive Co., a leading global
consumer-products company, reported record second-quarter earnings
and sales Thursday, attributing the gains to its powerful
distribution system and better known brands.
   The New York-based company said it earned $81.91 million or
$1.17 a share in the three months that ended June 30, an 11.3
percent gain over the $73.60 million or $1.06 a share earned a year
earlier. Sales totaled $1.45 billion vs. $1.29 billion, a 12.4
percent gain.
   ``Colgate's increased worldwide sales and profits in the second
quarter shows the growing strength of our worldwide distribution
network and well-known brand equities,'' said Reuben Mark,
chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   He said growth was strongest among its European, Mexican and
Venezuelan businesses, but operations in Brazil weakened due to
that country's economic austerity program. Growth in the Far East,
particularly in Thailand and the Philippines, also helped offset
weakness in Australia, he said.
   In the United States, a cost-cutting program contributed to
sharply higher profits on lower sales, as did growth of Colgate's
Specialty Marketing unit, comprised mainly of Hills Pet Products, a
leading animal dietary care company.
   For the first six months of 1990, Colgate said it earned $163.15
million or $2.32 a share, up 15.9 percent from the $140.80 million
or $2.04 a share earned in the year-earlier period. Revenues
totaled $2.75 billion vs. $2.49 billion, up 10.4 percent.
   Colgate-Palmolive makes products for oral and body care,
household cleaning and animal nutrition. Brands include Colgate
toothpaste, Ajax cleanser, Palmolive-Gold soap, Rapid Shave shaving
cream and Science Diet pet foods.

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said Thursday that
its second-quarter earnings fell slightly as cost reductions and
$25 million in asset sales offset sharp declines in trading and
investment banking.
   Separately, Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., a division of
Primerica Corp., reported a 24 percent gain in second-quarter
earnings due to good performances in trading, investment banking
and retail brokerage. The parent company's profits rose 29 percent.

<HEAD>Shearson</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Shearson, which is restructuring under parent American Express
Co., said it made $51 million, or 44 cents a share, in the three
months ended June 30. That was down 8.6 percent from $55 million,
or 54 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue fell 21 percent to $2.6 billion, from $3.3 billion in
the corresponding 1989 quarter, reflecting slow business conditions
across Wall Street.
   ``There certainly are indications of progress there,'' said
Lawrence Eckenfelder, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in San Francisco. ``You can't turn something like this around
with the snap of the fingers. It's going to take a while.''
   Shearson is overhauling much of its operations since American
Express stepped in to take full control of the struggling firm
suffering the effects of overexpansion and management problems in
the 1980s.
   Shearson lost $915 million in the first quarter, including a
$630 million charge against earnings to pay for a restructuring
that included 2,000 layoffs, consolidation of branch offices and
departure from some business lines. Further reductions are expected.
   In the second quarter, Shearson said revenue from investment
banking plummeted 42 percent to $154 million from $264 million,
reflecting the slack environment for underwriting, merchant
banking, and mergers and acquisitions.
   Trading commission revenue dropped 17.6 percent to $439 million
from $533 million a year earlier. Also down was investment advisory
revenue, off 10.9 percent to $156 million from $175 million.
   Shearson made up ground in a cost-cutting program instituted by
new chief executive Howard L. Clark Jr., a former American Express
executive who replaced the ousted Peter Cohen. The program is
designed to save $400 million a year.
   The firm said total expenses fell 22 percent in the second
quarter to $2.5 billion from $3.2 billion. Shearson also gained
from a sharp rise in interest and dividend income, to $80 million
from $23 million.
   In addition, Shearson reported a $16 million pretax gain from
the sales of the mutual fund and individual investor services
businesses of the Lehman Management Co. division to a subsidiary of
Salomon Inc., and a $9 million gain from the sale of a 50 percent
interest in PanAgora Asset Management Inc. to Nippon Life Insurance
Co.
   Shearson last month announced it was splitting into two
divisions, dropping the Hutton name _ which it added after the 1988
acquisition of retail brokerage E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. _ and emphasizing
the old Lehman Brothers investment banking name.
   American Express, which has pumped more than $1 billion in new
capital into the firm, is buying the remaining Shearson shares it
does not own.
   For the first six months of 1990, Shearson reported losses of
$692 million, or $10.08 a share, compared with a $70 million
profit, or 31 cents a share, for the first half of 1989.
   Revenue fell to $5.2 billion in the first half of the year from
$6.3 billion a year earlier.

   Smith Barney reported earnings of $16.6 million on revenue of

revenue of $389 million. The brokerage said its retail operations
benefited from the acquitision of 16 offices in May 1989 from the
now-collapsed firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Primerica, a diversified financial services company, reported
net income of $96.9 million, or 84 cents a share, in the period
ended June 30. That was up from earnings of $63.4 million, or 65
cents a share, in the same 1989 period.
   Quarterly revenue rose 10.7 percent to $1.55 billion from $1.4

   Claims by Western commercial banks
expanded by 9.8 percent on Eastern Europe last year and by 18.4
percent on the Soviet Union, according to a new survey released
Thursday.
   The Bank of International Settlements survey said the banks'
claims _ including loans plus accrued interest _ on Eastern Europe
went up by $3.3 billion during the July-December period to $96
billion following a $5.3 billion increase in the first half.
   Claims on the Soviet Union stood at $43.2 billion at the end of
the year, rising by $1.9 billion in the second half after
increasing by $4.8 billion in the first half. Undisbursed credit
commitments also continued to expand.
   At the same time, the Soviet Union drew down its deposits with
the reporting Western banks by $1.3 billion, according to the
survey.
   The other major Eastern European borrowers during the second
half of 1989 were East Germany at $800 million and Czechoslovakia
at $700 million. Claims on East Germany totaled $17 billion and on
Czechoslovakia were $5.4 billion at the end of the year. Claims on
Hungary totaled $11.9 billion, up $100 million, and were $10
billion on Poland, down $200 million.
   Lending to Third World countries _ excluding OPEC members _
dropped by $9.2 billion to $305.6 billion. Of these, claims on
Latin American countries declined by $7.7 billion to $176.1
billion, including a $3.3 billion decline in claims on Brazil and a
$2 billion drop in claims on Argentina.
   ``The declines occurred in spite of the accumulation of interest
arrears by these two countries and, in the case of Argentina, an
increase in claims on private non-bank entities,'' the survey said.
``The reduction in claims on Brazil appears to have resulted partly
from informal buy-backs of official debt at secondary market
discounts.''
   Claims on Mexico fell by $1.5 billion to $59.7 billion and
claims on Chile dropped $1 billion to $9.3 billion, the survey said.
   Colombia borrowed $300 million after signing a new lending
accord with creditor banks, bringing total claims on that country
to $6.3 billion.
   Claims on members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries went up by $1.9 billion to $101.5 billion, including a $2
billion increase for Iraq and rises of $400 million each for
Algeria and Iran.

   The stock market lost more ground today, weighed
down by earnings disappointments at several high-technology
companies.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 18.07 points on
Wednesday, dropped another 16.33 to 2,965.35 by 2 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 5 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 434 up,
1,014 down and 488 unchanged.
   The day's most conspicuous losers were concentrated in
technology issues with wide followings in the financial world.
   Tandem Computers, the most active NYSE issue, dropped 2{ to 19.
Tandem reported profits for the fiscal quarter ended June 30 of 30
cents a share, against 31 cents in the like period a year earlier.
   Lotus Development was the volume leader in the over-the-counter
market, down 6{ at 24}. On Wednesday the company posted strong
earnings, as expected, for the second quarter, but said its
third-quarter profits might fall short of comparable year-ago
levels.
   Apple Computer dropped 2| to 42 after the company also warned
that its earnings for the current quarter might show a decline.
   Ashton-Tate, which reported an unexpectedly wide loss for the
second quarter, fell ~ to 9{.
   Given that kind of turbulence, analysts said it wasn't
surprising that the market as a whole experienced a bumpy ride.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.06 to 197.77. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.72 at 360.34.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 109.22 million shares with two

<HEAD>Fujitsu Negotiating For Control Of Britain's Top Computer Maker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's biggest computer maker, Fujitsu Ltd., is
negotiating to buy a controlling stake in International Computers
Ltd., Britain's leading computer manufacturer, ICL's parent said
Thursday.
   A majority interest in ICL, likely to cost more than $1 billion,
would give Fujitsu a bigger foothold in the European Community
before the trade bloc dismantles its internal trade barriers in
1992. It also could offer ICL security for the future, analysts
said.
   A tie-up has been expected for months but analysts said they
were surprised that the parent company, STC PLC, might sell control
of ICL to Fujitsu.
   ICL is a major supplier of computer hardware to the Ministry of
Defense and other government departments. The idea of selling
control to a foreign company has raised concerns about British jobs
and national security.
   Lawmaker Lewis Moonie, who serves as the opposition Labor
Party's spokesman on technology matters, said, ``We are deeply
concerned about the implications for the British computers
industry, for jobs and research.''
   Larry Broke, national officer of the Manufacturing Science and
Finance workers union, said on BBC Radio: ``We are probably going
to witness the demise of Britain's last mainframe computer
manufacturer.''
   Broke said he would rather see British companies join European
partners to create a strong European computer industry.
   STC, formerly known as Standard Telephones and Cables, confirmed
the negotiations after Fujitsu President Tadashi Sekizawa said
earlier Thursday in Tokyo that his company was considering
purchasing an interest in ICL. No decisions have yet been made, he
said.
   Newspapers in Britain and Japan have reported that Fujitsu is to
acquire 50 to 60 percent of ICL for about 650 million pounds, or
$1.2 billion at current exchange rates.
   ICL has a value of about $2.2 billion, analysts estimate. It
employs 22,000 people and is Europe's most profitable mainframe
computer maker, they said.
   Its operating profit increased 13 percent to about $266 million
on an 18 percent gain in sales to $2.9 billion last year.
   But STC has warned that this year's performance might be
adversely affected by launch costs of new ICL products and key
customers' deferrals of capital purchases.
   STC's shares rose the equivalent of 44 cents to $5.11 a share on
London's Stock Exchange.
   Fujitsu's major activity in Europe is selling semiconductor
computer chips, although it makes office computers in Spain and
semiconductors in Ireland. It has marketing and development arms in
Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere.
   Rumors have circulated for about a year about a possible equity
tie between ICL and Fujitsu, which already have technology links.
Under a 10-year agreement signed in 1981, ICL uses Fujitsu's
computer chips and disks.
   STC Chairman Alan Walsh said earlier this year that his company
was looking for a partner to help carry the burden of heavy
research and development costs in the rapidly changing computer
industry.
   Given the existing ties, Fujitsu was the only company that could
take control of ICL, according to one London analyst, who requested
anonymity.
   ``Technologically, they are vital to the future of ICL,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Stotler Announces Investor Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commodities brokerage headed by Chicago Board
of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann may have found its financial
savior, according to an announcement Thursday by the firm's parent
company.
   Stotler Group Inc. said it had accepted an unidentified
investor's ``conditional offer to purchase a substantial equity
interest'' in Stotler Group.
   A one-page statement identifed neither the prospective investor
nor the size of the stake it has offered to buy.
   Mahlmann is managing partner of Stotler Group's principal
subsidiary _ Stotler and Co., a large, old-line trading company
that recently ran afoul of the federal government's minimum capital
requirements.
   Chicago-based Stotler Group, a publicly traded company,
confirmed in the announcement that Stotler and Co. had brought
itself into compliance with the capital requirements.
   The developments mean Stotler could avert a cash-flow crisis and
will avoid restrictions on its brokerage operations while sparing
Mahlmann further embarrassment.
   The statement said the offer announced Thursday was subject to
approval by the investor's board of directors. The deal will die if
such approval is not granted by 11 a.m. EDT Monday, Stotler Group
said.
   Stotler Group confirmed Wednesday's Board of Trade announcement
that it had brought itself into compliance with a Commodity Futures
Trading Commission rule requiring futures brokerages to maintain in
a separate account liquid assets equal to 4 percent of customer
funds.
   On Wednesday, after a deadline set by the Board of Trade had
passed, the exchange released a statement saying it ``believes the
firm has achieved the requisite capital requirements.''
   The exchange had ordered Stotler to boost its capital or face
restrictions on its trading activities. The exchange can force a
brokerage out of the business of trading for customers if its
capital level falls below 4 percent of customer funds.
   Stotler's plan for bringing its capital level into compliance
included trimming it customer base and finding an investor.
   Stotler Group had said that without new capital from an outside
source, it might have trouble meeting its debt obligations.
   Stotler is one of the country's 10 largest commodity brokerages,
with its roots in the grain business. The company also trades
financial futures, which have outstripped agricultural commodities
in trading volume in recent years.

   Ford Motor Co. indicated Thursday it
probably wouldn't eliminate plant overtime that the United Auto
Workers claims is straining employees.
   Owen Bieber, president of the UAW, said after opening contract
talks with the automaker that Ford was using extensive overtime so
it could employ fewer hourly workers.
   ``Ford's practice of running some of its plants at above-rated
capacity is its relentless effort to squeeze out costs,'' Bieber
said at a news conference after a ceremonial opening handshake with
Ford Vice President Peter Pestillo.
   UAW talks opened Wednesday with General Motors Corp. and begin
Friday at Chrysler Corp. The three contracts expire at midnight,
Sept. 14.
   At one point during the current three-year contract with the
UAW, Ford was running as much as 20 percent over factory capacity
in order to deal with surging car and truck demand. Sales since
then have weakened.
   The union has complained that physical and psychological burdens
on employees can result from such overwork. Extensive overtime also
indicates the company's hourly work force is too small, Bieber said.
   But UAW negotiators will have to negotiate the overtime issue
gingerly _ many Ford workers have become accustomed to regular
overtime in their paychecks.
   Pestillo said Ford would like to eliminate overtime in the
plants but probably won't do it.
   The Big Three are trying to prevent further erosion of their
share of the U.S. vehicle market to Japanese companies. They also
are concerned about federal government mandates for better gas
mileage and safety.
   Ford shut no plants during its current contract, instead cutting
back on overtime to reduce production.
   When UAW signed the current GM contract in 1987, it touted
job-protection provisions allowing the automaker to close a plant
only when sales of its products tumbled.
   But GM stopped production at four plants, saying they were
``indefinitely idled.'' Chrysler used the same contract provision
to shut down two assembly plants. A total of 17,000 hourly jobs
were lost.
   Ford last closed an assembly plant since 1983 when it shut its
San Jose, Calif., car and truck plant. During the boom years of the
mid-1980s, Ford paid overtime to keep the cars and trucks rolling
out of existing plants.
   The average wage for an assembly worker at the Big Three is just
less than $15 an hour before overtime or benefits.
   In addition to curbing overtime and protecting current jobs, the
union will seek higher wage and improved pensions, more management
accountability and protection of health-care benefits.
   The companies will be looking for more flexibility in work rules
and scheduling and ways to hold down soaring health costs.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Rise, Grains Slip In Quiet Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed mostly higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade while grain futures ended
mostly lower, reflecting near-perfect weather for crop development
and wheat harvesting.
   Trading activity was slow.
   Support for soybeans stemmed from reports that the Soviet Union
bought 330,000 metric tons of soybean meal from Argentina using
West German marks, said John Frazier, director of agricultural
trading with Gerald Inc. in Chicago.
   The reported purchase quieted speculation that the Soviets would
be unable to get financing for more grain purchases.
   A weather pattern of mild temperatures and occasional showers is
expected to continue through next week in the nation's midsection.
   Those conditions could bring the winter wheat harvest to its
abundant conclusion and help move the corn crop through its
critical pollination phase without incident.
   ``The weather is just about perfect and the market perceives
that,'' Frazier said.
   At the close, wheat futures were \ cent to 4\ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in July at $2.97 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 4{ cents lower with July at $2.67{ a bushel; oats were
} cent to 1{ cents lower with July at $1.17{ a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher with July at $6.02{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Ex-Citibank VP Gets 8 Years for $25 Million Theft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Citibank vice president whose job was
to safeguard assets was sentenced Thursday to eight years in prison
for embezzling securities worth $25 million from the bank's vault.
   Of the five $5 million certificates stolen, four were recovered
when the defendant, Mario Rios Pinochet, tried to negotiate them
three days after the Jan. 25 theft, prosecutors said.
   The fifth certificate, which matured in February, was never
recovered.
   Pinochet, 48, of Weston, Conn., claims to be a distant relative
of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.
   He was convicted in May by a Manhattan federal court jury of
four felony counts stemming from the embezzlement.
   Pinochet was fired by Citibank after his Feb. 1 arrest. He
maintains his innocence and plans an appeal.
   ``Even if it takes me 50 years, I am going to prove I am
innocent,'' he told U.S. District Judge Robert Ward.
   Ward's sentence of eight years fell in the middle range of the
punishment allowed by federal sentencing guidelines. The judge said
he considered the seriousness of the charges and Pinochet's lack of
remorse.
   ``There is no question that his position allowed him to commit
the crime,'' Ward said.
   Pinochet was a vice president in charge of a risk management
team that investigated discrepancies in the handling of
multimillion-dollar securities held by Citibank.
   Bank employees testified at trial that the bearer securities
disappeared while Pinochet was conducting a count of commercial
paper in the bank's vault under the guise of trying to improve
procedures to safeguard assets.
   Then, in what Ward described as a ``James Bond scenario,'' he
arranged the delivery of four of the certificates to the Stamford,
Conn., office of Paine Webber Inc. in an envelope taped to the
inside of a Chilean newspaper.
   According to trial evidence, Pinochet said he received the
certificates from a courier in Chile on behalf of three principals,
who turned out to be fictitious.
   He instructed a broker at Paine Webber to wire the proceeds to
an account in Bermuda, but the transaction was never completed
because the broker discovered that the securities had been reported
missing by Citibank.
   Ward also imposed three years probation but ordered no fine
because Pinochet, who is married with three children, has no money.
   The judge said Pinochet would have to pay restitution if
Citibank is held responsible for the missing $5 million certificate
during the years of his imprisonment and probation.
   Pinochet, who has been in jail since his arrest, was denied a
request to be freed pending his appeal.

   United Technologies Corp. reported
Thursday its second-quarter net income rose 5 percent on strong
results from its Pratt &amp; Whitney and Otis Elevator subsidiaries.
   UTC reported earnings of $207.5 million, or $1.64 a share, up
from $197.3 million, or $1.50 a share, for the same period in 1989.
   The company reported revenue of $1.87 billion, down slightly
from $1.91 billion a year earlier.
   The results reflected a $30 million pre-tax charge against
earnings from the planned closing of a Carrier manufacturing
facility in Syracuse, N.Y.
   Along with the strong results from Pratt &amp; Whitney and Otis,
improved earnings at the UT Automotive and Sikorsky Helicopter
divisions helped offset lower results at Carrier, said Robert F.
Daniell, UTC chairman and chief executive officer.
   For the first six months of the year, UTC reported net income of
$342 million, or $2.69 a share, up 6.5 percent from last year's
$321 million, or $2.45 a share.
   UTC's first-half revenue rose to $3.5 billion from $3.49 billion
a year earlier.

   A late wave of buying in blue chips helped the
stock market recover from a broad early decline to finish mixed
today.
   Analysts said disappointments in second-quarter earnings
reports, notably among technology companies, weighed down the
market at the outset.
   The day's most conspicuous losers were concentrated in
technology issues with wide followings on Wall Street.
   But buyers took the upper hand in the afternoon, going with
particular enthusiasm after energy issues as oil prices rose.
   Bullish traders evidently were not yet ready to give up on
chances for the Dow Jones industrial average to break through the
3,000 level, which it has been challenging for the past few
sessions.

<TEXT>
   Chiquita Brands Inc., the American
banana company, said Thursday it was cutting off talks with a union
whose strike has crippled Honduran banana exports.
   The 10,000 workers struck June 25 to demand the first pay
increase in six years. Wages now average $15.32 a day and workers
want a 57.8 percent increase.
   Chiquita's general manager, Karl F. Koch, said the company was
cutting off talks with the union. He blamed the union for taking a
``rigid position'' that has kept discussions stalled for two weeks.
   Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas said Thursday the
strike has cost the country more than $4.5 million.
   Union president Rene Ayestas said the union rejected Chiquita's
last offer of a 14.33 percent pay increase. He said the company
``has repeatedly offended us. Its offers are humiliating.''
   Cincinnati-based Chiquita, formerly United Fruit, accounts for
60 percent of Hondura's banana exports of 50 million boxes a year.
Castle &amp; Cooke, based in San Francisco, exports the other 40
percent.
   Callejas earlier sent a presidential mediation team to try to
solve the impasse. He called the situation ``tense and difficult.''
   The walkout initially was joined by 30,000 other workers in the
health, postal and industrial sectors along the Atlantic coast. But
those workers returned to work after 10 days.

   PPG Industries Inc., a maker of glass, paints

nearly 11 percent because of improved operating efficiency.
   PPG reported earnings of $141 million, or $1.31 a share, in the

   ``Improved operating efficiencies in all of our businesses

performance,'' PPG Chairman Vincent A. Sarni said.
   In the first half of 1990, earnings increased nearly 4 percent
to $266.3 million, or $2.47 a share, from $257.1 million, or $2.28
per share. Sales climbed to $3.05 billion from $2.95 billion.
   The second-quarter special charge resulted from an agreement in
which PPG will clean 53 chrome residue sites in New Jersey, pay a
$2.5 million fine, drop its lawsuits against the state and
reimburse the state $900,000 for administrative costs.
   The obligations stem from chrome chemical operations in Jersey
City that PPG discontinued nearly thirty years ago, the company
said.

<HEAD>Textron Earnings Improve 21 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textron Inc. reported Thursday its
second-quarter earnings rose 21.5 percent despite disappointing
results in its helicopter division.
   The conglomerate said it earned $72.1 million, or 80 cents per
share, up from the $59.3 million, or 67 cents per share, it earned
from April through June 1989.
   Revenue rose to $2 billion from $1.8 billion.
   Earnings at Textron's Bell Helicopter subsidiary fell to $27
million from $34.7 million a year earlier, largely because the
division had a ``less favorable mix of non-U.S. government sales,''
said B.F. Dolan, the conglomerate's chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Dolan credited gains in the company's financial services
subsidiaries for Textron's overall improvement.
   For the first six months, Textron's net income rose 12.8 percent
to $138.3 million, or $1.53 per share, from earnings of $122.6
million, or $1.40 per share, a year earlier.
   Textron's first-half revenue rose to $3.9 billion from $3.7
billion.

<HEAD>Say Bond Will Step Down As Chairman of Debt-Strapped Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debt-plagued Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond,
whose vast world holdings range from brewing to real estate, will
resign as chairman of his company to appease creditors under an
agreement announced Thursday.
   Bond's departure from Australia-based Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd,
more than $6 billion in debt, could lead to important refinancing
arrangements, company director Peter Lucas said in disclosing the
pact after a bondholders meeting in London.
   No decision has been made on who will replace Bond, Lucas said.
   He also said the 58 percent voting power of Bond's Dallhold
Investments Pty Ltd. over Bond Corp. Holdings would be restricted
to 25 percent.
   The bondholders decided at their meeting to form a committee to
improve communication between them and the company. Bondholders
meet again Aug. 9.
   Bond's departure is contingent upon bondholder approval of the
sale of Bond Corp. Holdings' brewery assets and permission to
suspend interest payments on two types of bonds, Lucas said.
   Bond Corp. Holdings plans to sell Bond Brewing Holdings for
about $1.4 billion to Bell Resources, an independently managed
affiliate of Bond Corp. Holdings.
   Bond's decision to separate himself from his company was
intended to entice bondholders to approve these steps, Lucas said.
   ``The proposed changes have been under consideration for some
time,'' Bond said in a prepared statement to the meeting.
   He said the changes ``should confirm in people's minds our
dedication to do everything necessary to restore full value to Bond
Corp.''
   Lucas said Bond recognized that stepping aside would be in the
interests of bondholders generally and that ``there should be seen
to be a change in the team.''
   Bond, who runs his empire from Perth, Australia, is considered
one of the world's most flamboyant entrepreneurs. He acquired a
string of media companies, brewing concerns, natural resource
companies and other properties largely through borrowed money.
   A combination of heavy debts, rising interest rates and bad
business decisions alienated Bond's bankers and creditors, put his
Australian brewing interests into receivership and has forced him
to sell assets ranging from a Hong Kong office development to a
coal mine.
   Bond's best-known U.S. business is the G. Heileman Brewing Co.,
a Wisconsin beer-maker burdened by heavy debt since he bought it
for $1.3 billion in borrowed money three years ago.
   Heileman has been trying independently to restructure the debt
in order to stay in business. It was not immediately clear how
Bond's agreement with other creditors might affect Heileman's
situation.
   Bond received a great deal of personal publicity for taking
financial assistance from Sotheby's auction house to purchase
Vincent Van Gogh's ``Irises'' from Sotheby's in 1987 for what was a
then-record $53.9 million.
   He also won notoriety for financing the Australian sailing
team's stunning triumph over the United States in the 1983
America's Cup race.

<TEXT>
   As expected, AT&amp;T on Thursday reported lower
second-quarter earnings, a 6.4 percent drop it attributed to
declining equipment sales and unexpectedly high startup costs for
the company's new credit card.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. warned of an expected drop in
earnings in an unusual announcement three weeks ago, but it did not
say how steep it would be.
   That announcement sent AT&amp;T's stock price tumbling. AT&amp;T is the
nation's most widely held stock.
   But the market had little reaction to the actual profit decline,
which was within the expectations of industry analysts. AT&amp;T shares
rose 37{ cents to close at $37.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   AT&amp;T said it earned $657 million, or 60 cents a share, in the
quarter ended June 30, down from $699 million, or 65 cents a share,
in the same quarter of 1989.
   Revenue fell to $9.03 billion from $9.26 billion a year earlier.
   It was the phone company's first quarterly earnings drop since
December 1988, when AT&amp;T lost $3.34 billion. That loss _ the
company's first ever _ resulted from a $6.72 billion charge it took
against earnings to pay for a modernization program.
   For the first six months of the year, AT&amp;T earned $1.33 billion,
or $1.22 per share, up from $1.29 billion, or $1.20 a share.
Revenue totaled $17.9 billion, virtually unchanged from the same
period of 1989.
   AT&amp;T said the disappointing results last quarter were due mostly
to slower sales of corporate telephone systems, data communications
gear and equipment sold to the federal government. The company also
blamed unexpectedly high costs for processing applications for its
Universal card, which combines a MasterCard or Visa with telephone
charge privileges.
   The New York-based company blamed the 2 percent drop in
equipment sales on a sluggish economy. It said the introduction of
the Universal card in March produced twice the expected number of
applications.
   AT&amp;T also said its long-distance revenue was down 1.8 percent in
the quarter due to less favorable access charge settlements with
local phone companies and customer shifts to lower-cost AT&amp;T
services. However, the volume of long-distance calls rose 7 percent.
   Industry analysts said the fact long-distance volume rose while
revenue declined pointed to the increasingly competitive nature of
the long distance phone business.
   AT&amp;T has been shifting its business customers to contracts that
save them money to keep them from fleeing to competitors, ``but it
has come at a price in terms of what has happened to revenue
growth,'' said Charles Nichols, who follows AT&amp;T for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Nichols said the second-quarter results also demonstrate how
closely AT&amp;T's fortunes are tied to the economy. As economic growth
slumps, businesses spend less on phone systems and computers such
as those sold by AT&amp;T.
   In addition, he said, the pace of growth in long-distance volume
has been slowing as the economy weakens.
   Despite the second-quarter problems, AT&amp;T said it stood by its
forecast that earnings for all of 1990 would exceed its record 1989
earnings of $2.7 billion.
   ``These results do not alter our confidence in our direction or
our future prospects,'' Chairman Robert E. Allen said in a news
release.
   Gregory Sawers, an analyst at the investment firm Sanford C.
Bernstein &amp; Co., said it is difficult to predict earnings for AT&amp;T
and other phone companies.
   ``This is really virgin territory for investors in the sense
there's never been a truly competitive long distance industry in
this country,'' he said.
   That uncertainty was demonstrated earlier this week, when United
Telecommunications Inc., parent of No. 3 long distance company US
Sprint, reported a 55 percent drop in its second-quarter earnings.
The news took industry analysts by surprise and sent the company's
stock price sliding.
   Also this week, No. 2 MCI Communications Corp. said its
second-quarter earnings rose 20 percent from a year earlier.

   Pacific Telesis Group said Thursday its earnings fell 13.2
percent in the second quarter, Southwestern Bell said its profit
was flat, and three other regional phone companies, Ameritech,
Bellsouth and Nynex, said their profits rose in the period.

   Pacific Telesis, based in San Francisco, said it earned $287
million, or 72 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30, down
from $325 million, or 79 cents a share, in 1989's second quarter.
Revenue totaled $2.43 billion, up from $2.41 billion.
   The company blamed the lower results on a rate reduction
associated with telephone regulation restructuring in California
and increased expenses for network and operating improvements.
   For the first six months of the year, PacTel earned $549
million, or $1.37 a share, down from $642 million, or $1.55 a
share, in the 1989 period. Revenue totaled $4.81 billion, up from
$4.75 billion.

   Southwestern Bell Corp. reported earnings of $262.5 million, or
87 cents a share, compared with $261.5 million, or 87 cents a
share, for the same period a year earlier. Revenue totaled $2.17
billion, up from $2.14 billion.
   The St. Louis-based company said state and federal telephone
rate reductions offset growth in new service.
   The company said earnings in 1989's second quarter were swollen
by a one-time $11.8 million gain from a phone routing change. If
that gain were excluded, Southwestern's profit would have risen 4.4
percent in this year's second quarter.
   For the first half of the year, earnings totaled $510.3 million,
or $1.70 a share, up 2.4 percent from $500.3 million, or $1.66 a
share, for the same period in 1989. Sales were $4.29 billion, up

   Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp. said it earned $445.2 million, or

1989's second quarter. Revenue totaled $3.62 billion, up from $3.47
billion.
   BellSouth said the earnings increase was due partly to greater
contributions from its domestic cellular telephone operations.
However, it said earnings growth was dampened by rate reductions in
several Southeastern states.
   For the first six months, BellSouth earned $868.4 million, or
$1.80 a share, compared with $867.7 million, or $1.83 a share, a

from $3.30 billion.
   The New York-based company said the results benefitted from
cost-containment programs and growth in its cellular phone business.
   For the first six months, Nynex earned $592 million, or $2.98 a

Revenue totaled $2.68 billion, up from $2.55 billion
   Ameritech said earnings were boosted by a 42 percent increase in
mobile phone line hookups.
   For the first six months, it earned $655.8 million, or $2.46 a

<TEXT>
   A major waste disposal company Thursday
unveiled a program to allow New York communities to choose whether
they want landfills or recycling centers, rather than letting the
state decide for them.
   ``We're asking that communities become our partners not just in
developing a site but in locating a site,'' Browning-Ferris
Industries Inc. Chairman William Ruckelshaus said.
   BFI, based in Houston, said its community partnership plan was
limited for now to New York state. The company said New York was
selected because it needs landfills and because the process of
opening new landfills has stopped.
   Only three new landfills have opened in New York since 1986
while hundreds have closed and hundreds more are under order to
close, BFI spokesman Gary Brotherton said. No landfill sites are
selected in advance under BFI's plan.
   ``We believe it is up to the community to decide whether or not
they want such a facility,'' Ruckelshaus said. ``If they decide
they'd like to go forward with a site, we'd like to participate.''
   Ruckelshaus, who twice headed the federal Environmental
Protection Agency and was an acting director of the FBI, said if
communities decide they don't want a landfill in their area BFI
won't request permission from the statee's solid waste management plan
to expand
landfill capacity to complement recycling and incineration
facilities.

   Ford Motor Co. said Thursday it is recalling

with automatic transmissions that might slip out of ``park.''
   Ford said 103,457 of the vehicles are in the United States,

notified by mail to bring the cars to dealers, the company said.
   Dealers will inspect the vehicles and, if necessary, replace
free a snap ring in the transmission with an improved part. A
broken snap ring can prevent the ``park'' mechanism from engaging.
   Ford has received about 100 complaints about the problem, none
involving accidents or injuries, spokesman Jim Trainor said.
   Trainor said about 90 percent involved the E-series vehicles,
Econoline vans usually used as urban delivery trucks or shuttle
vehicles. The rest involved F-series pickup trucks. The affected
vehicles are two-wheel drive.

   A spirited afternoon rally in blue chips helped
the stock market salvage a mixed showing Thursday from a session
that began with a broad decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 20 points at
its midsession low, closed with a 12.13 gain at 2,993.81.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
621 up, 858 down and 522 unchanged.
   Analysts said disappointments in second-quarter earnings
reports, notably among technology companies, weighed down the
market at the outset.
   The day's most conspicuous losers were concentrated in
technology issues with wide followings on Wall Street.
   But buyers took the upper hand in the afternoon, going with
particular enthusiasm after energy issues as oil prices rose.
   Bullish traders evidently were not yet ready to give up on
chances for the Dow Jones industrial average to break through the
3,000 level, which it has been challenging for the past few
sessions.
   In the energy sector, Exxon gained 1{ to 50; Mobil 2\ to 65};
Texaco 1} to 61{; Amoco 1| to 54, and Chevron 1{ to 76}.
   The story was much different in technology issues. Tandem
Computers, the most active NYSE issue, dropped 1~ to 19| after the
company reported profits for the fiscal quarter ended June 30 of 30
cents a share, against 31 cents in the like period a year earlier.
   Lotus Development was the volume leader in the over-the-counter
market, down 6&lsqb; at 25&lsqb;. On Wednesday Lotus posted strong earnings,
as expected, for the second quarter, but said its third-quarter
profits might fall short of comparable year-ago levels.
   Apple Computer dropped 2~ to 41} after the company also warned
that its earnings for the current quarter might show a decline.
   Ashton-Tate, which reported an unexpectedly wide loss for the
second quarter, fell ~ to 9{.
   Given that kind of turbulence, analysts said it wasn't
surprising that the market as a whole experienced a bumpy ride.
   Elsewhere, U.S. Shoe tumbled 4\ to 18. The company estimated
lower quarterly earnings, citing a softening of its optical
retailing business.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 161.90 million
shares, against 168.76 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 192.74 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.64 billion, or 0.10
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .55 to 199.38.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.67 to 433.20, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.10 at 365.32.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 2.65 to 458.18. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 361.84, down .22.

<HEAD>Japanese Company Buys West Virginia Ski Resort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese leisure and recreational
company has purchased West Virginia's largest ski resort for about
$20 million, it was announced Thursday.
   The sale of the Snowshoe Ski Resort by Ski Venture Inc. marks
the first U.S. acquisition by Tokyo Tower Development Co. Ltd.,
said Fukusabura Maeda, Tower's owner and chief executive officer.
   The deal also reflects growing Japanese interest in U.S.
recreational industries. For example, a number of Japanese
investors have ownership interests in American golf courses.
Japanese business concerns also have stakes in some New England ski
resorts.
   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton, who has actively sought
Japanese investment in one of the nation's poorest states, welcomed
the ski-resort deal and described Tokyo Tower as a leading
recreational developer.
   Tokyo Tower Development is an arm of the Tokyo Tower Group of
Companies operated by Nippon Television City Corp. Its trademark is
the Tokyo Tower, located in the center of Tokyo that serves as a
tourist attraction and media transmitter.
   ``Tokyo Tower Group studied a number of opportunities ranging
from California to Florida,'' Maeda said. ``We were very strongly
impressed with the physical beauty of the nature in West Virginia.''
   Hiroshi Kojima, senior director of the company's development
division, said Snowshoe was chosen because it has been successfully
operated for the past several years, after several bouts with
bankruptcy.
   Kojima promised both expansion and stability. He said the
current management team and employees will be retained.
   A group of eight thrifts bought the resort in October 1986 under
the umbrella company Ski Venture Inc. for $13.4 million. They
assumed $11.8 million in debt.

   Assets of the nation's 513 money market mutual
funds climbed $3.67 billion in the latest week to $389.91 billion,
the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$3.50 billion increase in the funds' assets the previous week. The
previous week's advance was originally reported as $3.10 billion
but the Washington-based mutual fund trade group revised it.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $392.14 billion in the week
ended March 21, 1990.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 251 general purpose funds rose $313.3 million to $134.70
billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds rose $361.6 million to
$160.40 billion, and assets of 160 institutional funds jumped $2.99
billion to $94.81 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.66 percent from 7.65 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield slipped to 7.66 percent from 7.67
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
44 days, up from 43 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts held at
6.14 percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.03 percent from 5.04 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.89
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.90 the
previous week. Yields were 8.06 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.09 percent; 8.08 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.10 percent;
and 8.16 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged from the previous week.

<HEAD>Double Hulls Create Controversy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Troubled Waters. Also moved on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A double hull creates a ship within a ship. It
is two layers of steel, separated by a gap of air, around the sides
and bottom of an oil tanker as an extra layer of protection.
   Environmental groups, in a letter to a congressional committee
this month, said requiring double-hull tankers was ``the single
most important step Congress can take to prevent oil spills.''
   A compromise is pending in Congress to have two hulls on new
tankers and to retrofit or phase out single-hulled tankers within
20 years. The House originally wanted a 15-year timetable while the
Senate asked for more study.
   ``A double hull is not a be-all or end-all. But we've got to
build redundancy into the system,'' said Clifton Curtis, president
of the Oceanic Society.
   Curtis called the compromise ``a signficant victory.'' But he
added: ``We are sorely displeased with the fact that the retrofit
schedule is not more rapid.''
   Advocates of double hulls say they would limit the impact of oil
spills if a tanker runs aground, because a reef or man-made object
would have to gash both layers to spill oil.
   A Coast Guard study of 30 tanker groundings between 1969 and
1973 said 96 percent of the spills would have been averted if the
vessels had double hulls.
   A double hull would not have prevented the Exxon Valdez spill,
but some studies say less crude oil would have fouled Prince
William Sound in the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``Double hulls are an extra margin of safety to prevent or
minimize marine accidents,'' said U.S. Coast Guard Commandant J.
William Kime.
   But critics say double hulls also may have drawbacks. Water can
rush in between layers of the steel and make a ship settle lower,
thereby leaking more oil. There are also fears explosive vapors
could gather between the gaps.
   Double hulls are also more expensive. It would have cost 10
percent to 15 percent more to build a double hull on the $125
million Exxon Valdez. Its damaged hull was repaired with 3,000 tons
of new steel, but it still doesn't have a double hull.
   Retrofitting the 153 U.S. tankers at $30 million each would cost
$4.6 billion; the same work on 900 foreign-flagged tankers could be
as high as $10 billion, industry officials said.
   But the oil industry believes the debate is misdirected.
   ``If an airplane crashes into a mountain, we don't build planes
that can withstand the impact. We try to find out why and prevent
it from happening again,'' said Sean Connaughton of the American
Petroleum Institute.
   ``If we have ships running into underwater mountains, we end up
with people calling for ships that can withstand that type of
collision,'' Connaughton said.
   Meanwhile, some companies aren't waiting for Congress.
   Houston-based Conoco Inc. ordered two double-hull tankers in
April and said it would order double-hull ships in the future.
   Norway's Statoil, the largest producer of North Sea crude oil,
said in June that it was ordering five new tankers, two with double
hulls and three with double or partial double bottoms.

<HEAD>Horizontal Drilling to Make Debut in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small local energy company plans to introduce
horizontal oil drilling to the Soviet Union when it begins
developing two oil fields in western Sibera.
   Anglo-Suisse, whose 10 employees specialize in international oil
exploration projects, will use horizontal drilling both on existing
wells and on the 400 additional wells the company plans to drill
throughout the 250,000 acres that compose the Tagrinskoye and West
Varyeganskoye fields. The company recently reached a development
agreement with a Soviet cooperative.
   Gilles Labbe, company president, said the 50-50 joint venture
will mark the first known Soviet foray into the popular drilling
technology, already credited with reviving previously dead oil
fields in Texas, Oklahoma and Wyoming, the Houston Chronicle
reported Thursday.
   Horizontally drilled wells begin as conventional, vertical
wells. Once deep underground, they are gradually turned at a
90-degree angle, enabling the drill bit to travel horizontally
across hydrocarbon reserves, rather than simply piercing them from
above.
   The development project is expected to produce as much as 800
million barrels of oil over its 25-year life, officials said.
   ``There are a tremendous number of prospects here,'' said Bob
Bryngelson, president of MER Engineering, a Houston firm working as
a subcontractor on the Anglo-Suisse venture. ``It's just like the
Middle East, but it's cold.''
   Anglo-Suisse will split the cost of the $100 million project
with the Varyegan Oil and Gas Association, a Soviet state oil
company.
   Varyegan is providing the energy infrastructure for the project,
including electricity, pipelines and roadway systems. Anglo-Suisse
will contribute the engineering work and the drilling technology.
Labbe said the company will begin soliciting investors for the
venture later this year.
   The costs and the profits will be split by the two partners.
   Anglo-Suisse began negotiating terms of the venture in March,
after being introduced to the Soviet association through contacts
in Burma. A contract was signed last month and work is scheduled to
begin next January.
   The Anglo-Suisse venture is similar to dozens of other
cooperative arrangements under negotiation between the Soviet
government and U.S. energy companies.
   Many of those projects have been slow to materialize, bogged
down by overburdened bureaucracies in both the United States and
the Soviet Union.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One key measure of the nation's money supply
rose while another fell in the week ended July 9, the Federal
Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,274.8 billion from a revised $3,277.5 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,061.5 billion from a revised $4,058.7 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $810.2 billion from a revised $817.7 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 3.6 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 1.3 percent, which is within the
Fed's new target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,269.1 billion, a 1.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,060.4 billion, up 0.2 percent, while M1
rose 3.2 percent to an average of $807.9 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $200 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $415 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$369 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $504
million in the two weeks ended July 11, down from $639 million in
the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $307.7 billion in the two-week period ended
July 11, down from $309.1 billion two weeks earlier.

<TEXT>
   Scripps Howard Broadcasting Co. said Thursday
it has signed a letter of intent to buy television station WMAR of
Baltimore from Gillett Group Inc. for $154.7 million.
   Scripps, an 80 percent-owned subsidiary of The E.W. Scripps Co.,
said it expects the transaction to be completed before the end of
next year.
   WMAR Channel 2 is an affiliate of NBC and recently signed a
three-year contract to continue as the flagship station for the
Baltimore Orioles baseball team.
   ``We have not made a major acquisition since 1986, preferring to
wait until an attractive opportunity presented itself,'' said
Lawrence A. Leser, president and chief executive officer of The
E.W. Scripps Co. ``This acquisition meets that criteria.''
   Scripps Howard Broadcasting operates nine television stations
and radio stations in three markets. The E.W. Scripps Co. operates
19 daily newspapers and cable television systems with 576,000 basic
subscribers.
   Gillett, which is based in Denver, acquired the station in
September 1986, according to spokesman Rich Boehne of Scripps.
   Calls to Gillett were not immediately returned.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower In Lackluster Trading, Gold Prices Soften</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mostly lower Thursday in
lackluster trading, with little news to affect the market, traders
said.
   Gold prices softened. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery settled at $361.40 a troy ounce,
off 20 cents from late Wednesday. Republic National Bank in New
York quoted a late bid for gold at $360.40 an ounce, down 70 cents.
   Traders described the currency market as listless, with major
dealers sidelined due to a lack of market-affecting news.
   ``There's no real reason to buy or sell dollars,'' said Gabriele
Schmitt, a vice president in the foreign exchange department of
Bank of New York.
   The only market activity came from small traders taking profits,
she said.
   ``It was one of those choppy days that didn't have much reason
behind it,'' she said.
   Traders said the market was seeking clearer signs on the
direction of interest rates and inflation. Congressional testimony
Wednesday by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan failed to ease
confusion over U.S. interest rates, they said.
   Greenspan said the central bank would lower rates to prevent a
recession, but only after lawmakers agreed on a deficit-reduction
package.
   The market was further confused about inflation by a Labor
Department report Wednesday that consumer prices climbed 0.5
percent in June, more than double the rate of the past two months.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 147.60 Japanese yen from
147.25 yen at Wednesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to
148.00 yen. In New York, one dollar bought 148.09 yen, up from
147.65 yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8155 from $1.8205 late
Wednesday. In New York, one pound cost $1.8165, more expensive than
$1.81525 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.6408 German marks, down from
1.6480; 1.4060 Swiss francs, down from 1.41585; 5.5045 French
francs, down from 5.5285; 1,201.75 Italian lire, down from
1,207.00; and 1.1524 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15425.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's levels were: 1.6430 West German marks, down from
1.6440; 1.4090 Swiss francs, up from 1.4085; 5.5100 French francs,
down from 5.5160; 1.8500 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8522; 1,203.00
Italian lire, down from 1,203.75; and, 1.1535 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1530.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $362.75 a troy ounce
from $360.25 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing
bid of $362.20 from $359.85 late Wednesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong,
gold rose $2.14 to close at $362.29 an ounce.
   Silver prices fell domestically after rising overseas. On New
York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.851
a troy ounce, down from $4.884 late Wednesday. In London, silver
bullion rose to a late bid price of $4.88 a troy ounce from $4.84
bid late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said Thursday
it will pay $20 million for a share in a venture formed by
Consumers Power Co. and Bechtel Corp. to purchase Consumers'
Palisades nuclear plant.
   Westinghouse will become a 22 percent partner in Palisades
Generating Co., a Pittsburgh, Pa.-based firm in the commercial
nuclear power industry, Consumers said.
   Consumers, which serves nearly 6 million customers in Michigan,
will hold a 44 percent equity interest in Palisades, while San
Francisco-based Bechtel will have a 33 percent share.
   Title to the 777-megawatt plant is expected to be transferred to
the partnership in early 1991, the companies said.
   Consumers and Bechtel proposed in October 1987 to form Palisades
to help resolve disputes stemming from Consumers' discontinued
Midland nuclear plant project, on which Bechtel was a contractor.

   The government's Export-Import Bank said
Thursday it wa lending China $14.3 million to buy equipment for an
airport and a plastics plant in Shanghai.
   Chinese borrowers will pay interest at an internationally agreed
rate of 8.3 percent a year for seven years.
   The Export-Import Bank lends at subsidized rates when necessary
to promote the sale of U.S. goods in competition with banks of
other governments eager for exports.
   President George Bush and other leaders of industrialized
nations agreed last week that loans to China should be limited to
basic human needs and to reforming the Chinese economy.
   The limitation does not apply to the new loans because they are
commercial, bank spokeswoman Ellen Schweppe said.
   One loan for $10 million and will buy equipment for the Hong
Qiao International airport at Shanghai from Aarotec-Airways
Engineering Associates of Fairfax, Va. The order includes baggage
handling, air conditioning and security systems.
   The other loan, for $4.3 million dollars, will be used to buy
equipment for Gao Qiao Petrochemical International Trading Co. The
seller is Rayonier C and C Ltd of Seattle. The Shanghai firm is
expanding its capacity to produce pellets used in refrigerator
liners and parts of other appliances.

<HEAD>Pork Bellies Limit Down For Second Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Frozen pork belly futures prices plummeted the 2-cents-a-pound
permitted daily limit for the second straight day Thursday on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting burdensome supplies and
slack demand for bacon.
   On other commodity markets, livestock futures ended mostly
lower; energy futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were mixed;
and precious metals retreated.
   Frozen pork bellies settled 2 cents lower across the board with
the contract for delivery in July at 46.50 cents a pound and the
more heavily traded August contract at 44.42 cents a pound.
   Weak consumer demand for bacon, which is made from pork bellies,
has weighed on the market for several weeks. The situation has been
reflected in the narrowing gap between prices of fresh bellies on
the cash market and frozen bellies on the futures market.
   Belly futures normally are priced about 5 cents below cash
bellies in mid-summer, creating an incentive for belly slicers to
take bellies out of cold storage to meet the traditional summer
surge in bacon demand, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling
Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill.
   But so far this month, bacon demand has been so weak and
supplies of fresh bellies so ample that cash prices have dropped
below futures. On Thursday, fresh bellies sold for as low as 43{
cents a pound compared with the low of 44.42 cents for the August
futures contract.
   ``The demand is slow enough that they're barely using the fresh
bellies, so there's no incentive for them to pull the bellies out
of the freezer,'' said Paul Georgy, president of the futures
brokerage Allendale Inc. in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   Georgy said the market may get some direction from the monthly
Agriculture Department cold storage report, which will be released
after Friday's close.
   In livestock trading in Chicago, live cattle futures settled .13
cent lower to .05 cent higher with August at 76.15 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were unchanged to .35 cent lower with August at 87.32
cents a pound; live hogs were .38 cent to .92 cent lower with July
at 63.57 cents a pound.
   Near-term energy futures rose on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in reaction to plans by operators of the Alaska pipeline
to reduce its output of crude oil by about 600,000 barrels per day
_ a 30 percent cut _ unless the company negotiates some other
agreement to address pollution concerns.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents lower to 44
cents higher with August at $18.99 a barrel; heating oil was .15
cent lower to .27 cent higher with August at 56.38 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .05 cent lower to .49 cent higher with August
at 63.07 cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures ended mostly higher in slow trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade while grain futures ended mostly lower,
reflecting near-perfect weather for crop development and wheat
harvesting.
   Support for soybeans stemmed from reports that the Soviet Union
bought 330,000 metric tons of soybean meal from Argentina using
West German marks, said John Frazier, director of agricultural
trading with Gerald Inc. in Chicago.
   The reported purchase quieted speculation that the Soviets would
be unable to get financing for more grain purchases.
   Wheat futures settled \ cent to 3} cents lower with July at
$2.97\ a bushel; corn was unchanged to 3\ cents lower with July at
$2.68} a bushel; oats were } cent to 1{ cents lower with July at
$1.17{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher with
July at $6.02{ a bushel.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures finished 20 cents
to 60 cents lower with August at $362.10 a troy ounce; silver was
3.3 cents to 5 cents lower with July at $4.851 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Reports Big Second-Quarter Earnings Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. reported a 28
percent drop in second-quarter earnings Thursday, saying high
interest rates have hurt its major markets.
   The supplier of construction and industrial materials said
earnings for the quarter ended June 30 totaled $39 million or 92
cents per share, vs. $54 million or $1.28 per share during the
year-earlier period.
   Second-quarter sales totaled $771 million vs. $721 million. The
1990 figures, unlike those of 1989, include results from Fiberglas
Canada.
   ``These results reflect weakness in our major markets, including
new housing construction, pleasure boats and automobiles,'' said
William W. Boeschenstein, chairman and chief executive officer.
``They are all being hurt by continued high interest rates and
cautious consumer buying.''
   Owens-Corning said most areas of its Construction Products
business were down during the quarter, thanks to declining new
housing and commercial construction. But sales of insulation and
roofing products for home improvements and remodeling held steady.
   Sales for the company's Industrial Materials Group were up
slightly during the quarter because of the addition of the results
from Fiberglas Canada. However, Owens-Corning said demand for
industrial materials appeared to be weakening in North America and
in Europe.
   For the first six months, Owens-Corning said earnings totaled
$71 million, or $1.68 per share, compared with $89 million, or
$2.10 per share, during the first six months of 1989. Sales totaled
$1.5 billion vs. $1.4 billion.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Houghton Mifflin Co. posted a 9.5 percent rise in
second quarter earnings, but the publisher said Thursday its third
quarter performance will be crucial to making the year a success.
   Earnings for the quarter that ended June 30 were $11.5 million,
or 81 cents a share, compared with $10.5 million, or 74 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Net sales of $122.5 million were recorded for the second
quarter, a rise of 11 percent over last year's $110.4 million.
   Houghton Mifflin, best known as a publisher of textbooks,
reported a loss for the first half of the year of $554,000, or 4
cents a share. That compared with a loss of $749,000, or 5 cents a
share, for the same period in 1989.
   The results for the first six months of 1990 included a
non-recurring net gain of $4 million, or 17 cents a share, after
taxes, the company said.
   First-half sales rose 8 percent to $166.3 million from $154.0
million a year earlier.
   ``The first-half results were in line with our 1990 business
plans, which call for increased revenues and income for the full
year,'' Nader Darehshori, chairman and chief executive officer,
said in a prepared statement.
   ``However, school and college textbook sales in the third
quarter will be key to full-year results because a large proportion
of those materials are ordered for the beginning of the new school
year,'' Darehshori said.
   Stephen Jaeger, senior vice president and chief financial
officer of the firm, said a first quarter loss was to blame for the
half-year loss.
   ``In the first quarter of the year our seasonal loss was larger
than it had been historically,'' Jaeger said in an interview. The
first quarter in the publishing business is always one of little
gain while fixed costs must still be paid, he said.
   ``That loss was right in line with our expectations for the
period,'' he said.
   Houghton Mifflin gets about 80 percent of its income from
textbooks, the rest comes from general interest books.
   Sales in the company's general publishing section rose 33
percent in the second quarter. Educational publishing sales rose 8
percent and sales of elementary and secondary school texts made a
strong showing as well, due in large part because some states
placed orders earlier than expected.
   Second-quarter expenses included an increase in the costs of
developing new textbooks.

   Grumman Corp. Chairman John O'Brien has
resigned and the defense contractor announced Tuesday it had
elected the company's technology chief to take over.
   O'Brien, 60, resigned as chairman, president, chief executive
officer and board member. According to a press release, O'Brien, a
35-year veteran of the company, cited personal reasons. A company
spokesman would not elaborate.
   O'Brien will be available to help in the transition, the company
said.
   Taking his place will be Renso Caporali, 57, the vice chairman
for technology. Although the board elected him to the three posts,
the board is reviewing candidates for the jobs, including Caporali,
said W.B. Jones, a Grumman spokesman.
   ``My job will be to maintain the course we've set, which
includes restructuring the company into a more efficient and
cost-competitive form,'' Caporali said.
   Grumman reported a 22 percent drop in net income for 1989 and
said it planned to cut 1,000 jobs by the end of 1990. The cuts come
on top of 3,000 work force cuts in 1989 that left the defense
contractor with 28,900 employees.
   Caporali has been with Grumman for 31 years. As vice chairman
for technology, he oversaw research and development, engineering
and advanced systems.

   Hasbro Inc. on Thursday reported a 52 percent drop in
second-quarter earnings because of costs from a dicontinued toy
while Mattel Inc. said its profits rose 22 percent.

<HEAD>Hasbro</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., said it earned $8.7 million,
or 15 cents per share, from April to June. That compared with $18.2
million, or 31 cents per share, during the same 1989 period.
   Revenue fell 7.8 percent to $277.3 million from $301.4 million.
   Hasrbo chief financial officer John T. O'Neill said costs
associated with the dropped racing car toy Record Breakers hurt
earnings. The company also blamed the poor performance on slow
domestic sales.
   For the first six months of 1990, earnings fell 23.6 percent to
$28.2 million, or 48 cents per share, from $36.9 million, or 63
cents per share.
   Half-year revenue was $578.4 million, down from $589.7 million
last year.
   Hasbro is counting on a third-quarter rebound from the
introduction of dolls based on the pop music group New Kids on the
Block and on performers affiliated with the World Wrestling
Federation.

   Hawthorne, Calif.-based Mattel profits rose on strong

   Mattel said it earned $20.3 million, or 40 cents per share, in
the second quarter, up from $16.6 million, or 33 cents a share,
last year. Sales rose 17 percent to $318 million from $272 million.
   In the first half of 1990, earnings gained 37 percent to $28.7
million, or 57 cents per share, on sales of $552 million. That
compared with 1989 first-half earnings of $20.9 million, or 42
cents per share, on $468 million in sales.
   The company benefited from increased sales of such core products
as Barbie, Hot Wheels, Disney Preschool and Infant Toys, He-Man,
large dolls and See'N Say, said John W. Amerman, chairman and chief

<HEAD>Energy Futures Close Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices closed mostly higher
Thursday after a session largely dominated by technical factors.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rose 44 cents to $18.99 a 42-gallon barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The contract fluctuated fom a low of $18.47 to a high of $19.51
during the day as traders sought to profit on the price difference
between the August and September contracts. Oil for September
delivery closed at $19.86 cents a barrel, up 25 cents.
   Prices also got a nudge upward from word that the flow of crude
through the Alaska pipeline was being reduced, but late
profit-taking brought futures down to their closing levels.
   Greg Dreis, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures, said
there also were rumors in the market for a second day about
possible military action between Iraq and Kuwait.
   Iraq has accused Kuwait of stealing oil worth $2.4 billion from
Iraqi territory near their border. Iraq has been campaigning
against fellow members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries who have exceeded production limits set by the cartel,
especially Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
   OPEC has scheduled a meeting on pricing and production next
week. Oil traders, increasingly optimistic that the cartel will be
able to curb its production problems, were reluctant to sell
heavily Thursday.
   Prices for refined products traded on the mercantile exchange
ended the day mixed.
   Unleaded regular gasoline for August delivery rose 0.40 cent to
63.07 cents a gallon. The August contract for home heating oil
picked up 0.27 cent to close at 56.38 cents a gallon, but
subsequent months closed lower.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract closed at $1.445 per
1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.450 on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Occidental Petroleum Corp. reported an 11
percent rise in second-quarter earnings Thursday, benefiting from
the impact of one-time gains that helped offset a big decline in
the company's chemical business.
   Earnings for the three months ended June 30 totaled $89 million
or 30 cents a share, up from 80 million or 29 cents a share a year
earlier. The per-share figures reflected the issuance of 23 million
new shares earlier this year.
   Sales totaled $5.1 billion, unchanged.
   The 1990 second-quarter results included an after-tax gain of
$41 million from selling some domestic oil and gas properties. They
also were helped by a net extraordinary gain of $20 million, due
mainly to tax carry forwards.
   The second quarter of 1989 had included an extraordinary loss of
$4 million resulting from paying some debt off early.
   ``We are pleased that the earnings from our oil and gas, natural
gas transmission, agribusiness and coal operations all show
improvement,'' Occidental Chairman Armand Hammer said in a
statement.
   But he said chemical operations were suffering from industrywide
softness. The unit's earnings declined by $134 million in the
quarter.
   For the six months, earnings totaled $197 million or 67 cents a
share, up from $147 million or 53 cents a share a year earlier.
Sales totaled $10.28 billion vs. $10.19 billion.

<HEAD>Breeden Defends CFTC Chief, Suggests Deposit Insurance Cap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard C. Breeden wound up defending rival regulator Wendy Gramm
Thursday to a Senate panel questioning White House commitment to
legislation that would shift regulatory control of stock index
futures.
   Breeden also suggested a cap on the deposit insurance system and
said a tax on stock transactions could hurt the markets.
   But the Senate Banking Committee hearing on modernizing
financial institutions shifted to pending legislation on stock
index futures as several panel members expressed doubts that the
administration was really behind the bill.
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., said it looked like a ``cynical
political exercise'' by the administration to support the bill.
   ``And then when it doesn't pass _ and I think right now it's
looking very shaky up here _ they can say, `We told you so.' It's
just like the S&amp;L scandal. Now it's the Congress' fault.'''
   Despite officials' claims that the bill must pass, there hasn't
been much lobbying by top administration officials, noted Sen.
Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich.
   ``There is not a full-court press going on,'' said Riegle,
chairman of the committee. ``In terms of an all-out effort to get
this accomplished, I'm not seeing that.''
   The legislation would strip the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission of authority over stock index futures and transfer it to
the SEC.
   Stock index futures, often used in program trading strategies by
large institutional investors such as pension funds, allow
investors to trade on the movement of a basket of stocks without
having to buy the underlying stocks.
   Breeden and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady say the SEC should
have control over stock index futures to curb extreme volatility.
   But Wendy Gramm, the CFTC chairman, as well as futures exchanges
and CFTC supporters on congressional agriculture committees claim
the jurisdiction switch isn't necessary and in fact would hurt the
futures markets.
   When Wirth questioned how Gramm _ a presidential appointee _
could be at odds with administration policy, Breeden found himself
in the unusual position of defending his sometime-adversary.
   ``One should not undercut the ability of the head of an
independent agency to express disagreement,'' Breeden said.
   Asked about a possible tax on securities transactions that White
House budget experts have reportedly been kicking around, Breeden
said: ``I think we have to be extraordinarily careful in creating
taxes on capital formation.''
   ``We have to be very careful that we do not take steps which
drive trade from our shores,'' he said.
   Outside the hearing room, Breeden said he has not been privy to
White House budget talks and does not know if a transaction tax is
still on the table.
   He also declined to speculate on the fate of the stock index
futures bill, although he said he was encouraged by the number of
senators at the hearing who expressed a need for reform.
   In his testimony, Breeden outlined possible reforms of deposit
insurance, which many fear could be subject to losses similar to
those incurred in the multi-billion dollar savings and loan bailout.
   He suggested a possible cap on deposit insurance, which now
guarantees deposits of up to $100,000 in every account.
   Breeden said the cap could limit the amount of deposits insured
in each account or limit the number of accounts an individual can
have insured.
   He also suggested a system in which consumers would determine
how much deposit insurance they want and pay accordingly, much like
life insurance.
   ``I think most taxpayers are showing signs of being irate at
having to pay for the losses the savings and loans incurred. I
think there will be very strong public support for trimming deposit
insurance so that the thrift nightmare cannot be repeated,''
Breeden told reporters.

<HEAD>Earnings Up 10 Percent; Razor Sales Strong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. said Thursday that second-quarter
earnings rose 10 percent on a big increase in razor sales and
strong performance by its European division.
   For the period ended June 30, the personal care giant reported
profits of $379.4 million, or 70 cents per share, up from $344.6
million, or 65 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.
   Sales rose 14 percent to $1.03 billion from $903.9 million for
the first three months in 1989.
   Gillette spokesman David A. Fausch said an across-the-board
earnings increase included a 33 percent rise in razor sales. Sales
by Braun, Gillette's European division, increased 20 percent.
   In addition, Gillette shipped almost 17 million of the new
Sensor razor since its introduction in January, well ahead of an
originally projected 20 million for the year.
   For the first six months of 1990, Gillette reported net income
of $172.8 million, or $1.45 a share, an increase of 7 percent from
$162 million, also $1.45 a share, in the same 1989 period.
   First-half sales rose to $2.08 billion from $1.84 billion.

<HEAD>Unisys Profit Drops Sharply in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. reported Thursday a 78
percent drop in second quarter profit, while revenues dipped 4
percent.
   The nation's third-largest computer company said it earned $11.8
million in the quarter, down from $53.6 million in the second
quarter of 1989. Unisys officials blamed the results partly on weak
domestic sales.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $2.47 billion, down from $2.57
billion for the same period last year.
   After paying $26.9 million in preferred stock dividends, the
company lost $15.1 million in the quarter, or 9 cents per share.
   Analysts said Unisys officials are making slow but steady
progress in turning around the company and predicted improvement.
   ``It was obviously a disappointment, but I think think they'll
show results _ a dollar or so _ by the end of the year,'' said
William H. Gorman, an analyst for Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia. He said benefits from last year's reorganization and
work force cuts wouldn't start to show up until the last half of
the year.
   Standard &amp; Poors Corp. said Thursday it had put Unisys' senior
and subordinated debt and preferred stock on its Creditwatch list
with negative implications. The ratings agency said it is concerned
about Unisys's ability to improve profitability and revenues over
the long term.
   Unisys said its worldwide orders posted a slight gain in the
quarter as defense orders rebounded from depressed levels a year
earlier. Gains in international commercial orders were offset by
continued weakness in U.S. orders.
   ``Our U.S. business remains weak and our international business,
while still growing, is not as robust as a year ago,'' said James
A. Unruh, president and chief executive officer.
   Unisys also reduced its debt by $265 million in the quarter, and
Unruh said the company made significant progress toward a goal of
reducing debt by $600 million to $800 million this year.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction fell for a fifth straight
month in June, hitting its lowest level since the last recession,
the Commerce Department said Wednesday.
   Analysts said the 2.3 percent decrease in housing starts last
month offered disturbing evidence of continued weakness in the
overall economy, especially in the housing industry.
   ``There's still a stranglehold of weak growth, as demonstrated
by the housing report,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the
Boston Co.
   Analysts said the housing industry had been battered by high
interest rates, lower income growth and a deterioration in consumer
confidence.
   However, they said the slump may be showing signs of bottoming
out. They noted that mortgage rates, which shot up from
mid-December to early May, have been falling since that time,
giving hope that potential buyers will be attracted back to the
market.
   Also, in one bit of good news in the new report, the government
said applications for building permits rose in June for the first
time since January. The 3.9 percent increase pushed permit
applications to an annual rate of 1.11 million units.
   ``What has happened here is we've hit a plateau ... We've been
able to hang on to a little bit of a ridge on the cliff where we
were falling down,'' said Martin Regalia, chief economist for the
National Council of Savings Institutions.
   In June, new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.18 million units, the government said.
   Last month's decline followed decreases of 0.9 percent in May,
6.9 percent in April, 12.2 percent in March and 5.1 percent in
February.
   It marked the first time housing construction has fallen for
five months in a row since a string of declines from July through
November in 1981. It pushed the level of building activity to its
lowest point since October 1982.
   Analysts said they do not expect building activity to rebound
significantly until a large backlog of unsold homes is worked down.
   The Bush administration, fearful of the adverse impact that high
interest rates were having on the economy, has been pushing the
Federal Reserve to loosen its grip on credit. The Fed made a small
move in that direction last week.
   For June, construction of single-family homes edged down a
slight 0.1 percent to an annual rate of 892,000 units. Construction
of multi-family units fell 8.7 percent to an annual rate of 285,000
units.
   All geographic areas of the country except the South suffered
declines.
   The weakness was led by a big 10.9 percent drop in the
Northeast, while housing starts fell 10.1 percent in the West and
9.2 percent in the Midwest. The South had an 8.7 percent jump to an
annual rate of 532,000 units.

<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc., citing good demand
and improved gross margins, on Wednesday reported a 25 percent
increase in third fiscal quarter profits.
   Earnings for the three-month period that ended June 29 were
$119.8 million, or 96 cents per share, on sales of $1.365 billion.
For the same period a year ago, earnings were $96.1 million, or 74
cents per share, on revenues of $1.248 billion.
   Sales of Apple's high-end, modular Macintosh computer products
were strong during the third quarter, and recent ``pricing
actions'' on some compact Macintosh computers helped push up
demand, John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive officer,
said in a statement.
   After several years of rapid growth, Apple's sales have slowed
recently, with critics blaming the company's woes on the absence of
a cheap Macintosh. In February, the company cut prices on some of
its products by up to 17 percent.
   During the first nine months of the fiscal year, earnings were
$376.4 million, 28 percent more than the $293 million earned in the
first three months of fiscal 1989. Revenues for the first three
quarters rose 8 percent, from $3.9 billion to $4.2 billion.

<HEAD>Mack Reports $63 Million Loss; Navistar Expresses Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mack Trucks Inc. reported a $63 million
loss in the second quarter Thursday and gained a second suitor _
Navistar International Corp.
   The interest from Navistar came two weeks after Renault
Vehicules Industriels, which owns 44.6 percent of Mack stock,
announced it wanted to acquire the Allentown-based truck maker in a
buyout of $6 a share. The French automaker said it would spend $98
million for the Mack stock.
   Navistar spokesman Bill Greenhill said the Chicago-based truck
maker has requested additional information from Mack to determine
whether to make an offer and at what price.
   Navistar told Renault it would probably take about 10 days to
complete its review and make a decision.
   In a letter to Mack, Navistar said it would not proceed with the
offer without Mack's approval and a decision by the Renault group
to sell, Greenhill said.
   In a statement issued by Renault, the company said it has told
Mack's board it has no interest in selling its stake in the truck
maker. Renault's offer is due to expire at midnight Aug. 8.
   Mack's net loss of $63.3 million for the second quarter, or
$2.13 per common share, compared to a net loss of $19.6 million, or
66 cents per common share, for the same period last year.
   The company reported net sales of $400.9 million in the second
quarter, down 23 percent from the same period in 1989, when net
sales were $518.85 million.
   In a further complication of Mack's financial situation, Mack
Financial Corp. has been trying to extend a $350 million revolving
credit agreement with Chemical Bank that matures Friday.
   Company spokesman James Santanasto said Thursday no extension
had been granted but negotiations were continuing.
   The second-quarter losses were due largely to significant drops
in sales and gross margin levels, the company said.
   Also affecting the results was $21.7 million added to the
warranty program, which the company said needed a boost in its
reserves because of ``continued unfavorable experience.''
   The second quarter results have caused Mack to violate the terms
of a $148 million credit agreement with Citibank N.A. and the New
York branch of Credit Lyonnais.
   The violation, if not waived, would permit the banks to
accelerate payment on the outstanding principal.
   Mack, pointing to Renault's offer, has requested a waiver until
Dec. 31. Santanasto said Thursday the discussions were continuing.

<HEAD>Georgia Pacific Earnings Dip, Reflecting Costs of Great Northern
Takeover</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS reports from Champion, Bowater</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. reported Thursday its
second-quarter earnings declined 38 percent as costs from its
takeover of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. offset strong sales.
   Other paper companies also reported steep drops in earnings.
Bowater Inc., of Darien, Conn., reported 63 percent decline and
Stamford, Conn.-based Champion International Corp.'s profit dropped
44 percent.
   Georgia-Pacific said its net income fell to $107 million, or
$1.25 a share, from $172 million, or $1.90 a share, in the same
period of 1989.
   The recent three-month period was the first full quarter in
which the two corporations were combined. Georgia-Pacific and
Connecticut-based Great Northern agreed in February to a $5 billion
merger, creating the nation's largest paper and forest products
company.
   Georgia-Pacific's sales for the quarter totaled $3.5 billion, up
from $2.6 billion a year earlier, but the increase was offset by
takeover-related interest expenses, the company said.
   Interest expenses rose to $185 million from $66 million a year
ago.
   Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr., in a statement
accompanying the earnings report, stressed the sales gains.
   ``The company's building products business has experienced a
record second quarter,'' Hahn said, noting that despite a decline
in housing starts the company has benefited from an increased
demand for materials used in the remodeling and repair market.
   Prices for the company's forestry products are up also because
of a diminishing supply of timber in the Northwest, he said.
   The company's pulp and paper divisions have shown gains mainly
because of demand for communication papers, Hahn said.
   For the six months ending June 30, Georgia-Pacific's net income
was $208 million or $2.43 per share, down 36 percent from $326
million or $3.55 a share for the first six months of 1989.
   First-half sales totaled $6.2 billion, up from $5.1 billion
during the same period a year earlier.

<HEAD>Champion International Corp.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Champion said its earnings drop was caused by production losses
and higher taxes on a Brazilian subsidiary.
   Champion's after-tax profit for the second quarter was $63
million, or 60 cents per share, compared with $114 million, or
$1.16 per share, for the same period last year.
   The company reported $81.8 million in income from operations for
the second quarter, compared with $207.4 million for the second
quarter of 1989.
   The second-quarter figures include $43 million set aside to pay
for costs incurred in cutbacks at its Canton, N.C., mill.
   In addition, Champion had several one-time gains in the second
quarter, including $11 million from the sale of a portion of its
West Coast Timberlands division, $18 million from the disposal of
fixed assets and divested operations and $39 million from the
favorable resolution of issues related to the merger with St. Regis
Corp.
   Income dropped at the company's Brazilian subsidiary due to an
economic reform package that included higher taxes, the company

   Bowater Inc. blamed a continued slump in newsprint prices for
its earnings drop. Bowater said another factor contributing to the
drop was a $9 million, one-time charge to retire 12&rsqb; percent
interest rate bonds.
   For the second quarter, after-tax profit totaled $14.2 million,
or 36 cents per share, on revenue of $342.3 million. That compared
to earnings of $38 million, or $1.01 per share, on revenue of
$363.6 million for the same period last year.
   A.P. Gammie, chairman and chief executive officer of Bowater,
said he expected newsprint prices to rise in the second half of
1990.

<HEAD>Iraqi Parliament Wants Saddam to be President for Life</HEAD>

   Iraq's Parliament has proposed that
President Saddam Hussein be president for life, the official Iraqi
News Agency said Thursday.
   The 250-member assembly, which has been dominated by the
governing Baath Party for the last two decades, on Wednesday ended
a special three-day session to debate the new constitution.
   INA said the assembly proposed changing a new draft constitution
that said presidential elections should be held for the first time
since Iraq became a republic in 1958, with the head of state
serving an eight-year term.
   Saddam, 54, has said he will run in the election, but so far
there has been no mention of any challengers.
   That was part of a package of political reforms, including a
multiparty system and a free press, Saddam promised following the
August 1988 cease-fire in Iraq's eight-year war with Iran.
   These were widely seen as being little more than a nod toward
democracy with Saddam staying firmly entrenched in power in this
Middle East nation of 17 million people.
   Saddam has been in absolute control since July 1979, when he
took over as president from Gen. Ahmed al Bakr. He served as vice
president under Bakr for 10 years and in effect became the
strongman of the Baathist regime.
   INA said the assembly proposed other changes in the draft
constitution, but only mentioned the proposal to make Saddam
president for life.
   Under the present constitution, the president is elected by the
Revolutionary Command Council composed of senior Baath figures.
   It will replace the current constitution drawn up in 1968, when
the Baath Party seized power in a coup. Iraq's estimated 8 million
eligible voters will decide on the new constitution in a nationwide
referendum later this year.
   If Saddam is elected president for life, presumably by the
Revolutionary Command Council, it will consolidate his rule over
Iraq through his vast security apparatus.
   The inner circle of the leadership is packed with Saddam's
relatives, by blood or marriage, from his extended clan from Takrit
in northern Iraq.
   During the Persian Gulf war, Saddam made his power absolute by
imposing tight personal control of the 1 million-strong military
and the Baath Party, ostensibly socialist and pan-Arab but now
almost devoid of ideology beyond Saddam's policies.
   He has turned his hold on power into a personality cult. Photos
and posters of Saddam are everywhere. It is a capital offense to
insult him publicly.
   Iraqi dissident sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
have claimed in recent weeks that up to 40 senior military figures,
including a cousin of Saddam, were arrested and probably executed
in Saddam's latest purge.
   There has been no independent confirmation of the reports.
   Since the cease-fire, Saddam has revived his ambitions to become
the paramount leader of the Arab world and has built up an arsenal
of long-range missiles and chemical weapons that has drawn
denunciations from the West and Israel.
   The president-for-life move was reported after Saddam earlier
this week accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of violating
their OPEC oil production quotas and threatened to retaliate with
force, if necessary.
   He blamed them for an oil glut that drove down prices that he
claimed has cost Iraq $14 billion in lost revenue in the last year.

   A key figure in the collapse of
Silverado Savings &amp; Loan lives in a $1.9 million home despite
telling a congressional committee he was broke, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
   Developer Bill L. Walters, 44, also is a former business
associate of Neil Bush, President Bush's son and a former director
of Denver-based Silverado. Investigators say Walters' default on
$106 million in real estate loans extended by Silverado contributed
to the thrift's collapse.
   A trust for Walters' wife, Jacqueline, purchased the $1.9
million estate near Newport Bay for the couple in February,
according to Orange County records reviewed by the Los Angeles
Times.
   State records also show Mrs. Walters bought a mobile home on
prime oceanfront property in Laguna Beach for $250,000, the
newspaper reported.
   Federal regulators seized Silverado in December 1988. Its
failure is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1 billion.
   During a House Banking Committee hearing on Silverado's failure,
Walters was asked last month about his financial condition.
   ``I have a negative net worth,'' he testified.
   Documents filed with the Orange County recorder's office
indicate the luxurious Newport Beach home was purchased by the
Walters Trust I, of which Jacqueline Walters is the beneficiary.
   The mobile home in the beachfront El Morro Beach Mobile Home
Park also is listed in Mrs. Walters' name, the Times reported.
   Walters could not be reached immediately for comment Wednesday
by The Associated Press. There was no public listing of Walters'
residential and business telephone numbers.
   He moved to Orange County five months ago to begin anew in the
real estate business, the Times said. But the Orange County Board
of Realtors said Wednesday he was not listed with the organization.
   Congressmen reacted angrily at word of the home.
   ``The government should immediately take action to file claims
against all of Mr. Walters' property so the taxpayers can get their
money back,'' said Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the
Housing Financial Institutions subcommittee.
   ``This is what happens when the Bush administration doesn't
aggressively go after those who cause the savings and loan fraud,''
said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of a House panel
overseeing the industry bailout.
   The Bill L. Walters Co. was one of Denver's largest development
firms, employing about 1,000 people. Its holdings included office,
retail and hotel buildings and athletic clubs.
   Neil Bush and Walters were partners in JNB Exploration, an oil
exploration company. Walters testified at the hearing that he paid
$150,000 in 1983 to own 6 percent of the company while Bush paid
$100 to gain an 87.5 percent stake.
   Bush joined Silverado's board of directors two years later.
   Documents released last week by federal regulators indicate Bush
voted to approve the in loans to Walters.
   Walters, one of Silverado's preferred shareholders and one of
its biggest borrowers, said he would try to pay back the money.
   ``I have elected to spend the last year and a half working
diligently with my lenders, restructuring, staying alive for
another day so that I can pay every dime back if I can,'' he said.
