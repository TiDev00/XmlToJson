   A man convicted of murdering three women in
three states was executed in the electric chair Thursday night for
raping and killing a pregnant Virginia nurse in 1978.
   Buddy Earl Justus was prounounced dead shortly after 11 p.m. at
the State Penitentiary.
   Justus was the 11th person to die in the electric chair since
the state resumed executions in 1982 and the 143rd nationwide since
the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to revive the death penalty
in 1976.
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder refused Thursday night to grant clemency
on grounds Justus had brain damage, said Laura Dillard, Wilder's
spokeswoman.
   Ms. Dillard said Wilder had no reason to grant clemency, but
provided no further details on his decision.
   Justus' lawyer, Georgetown University law professor John
Copacino, said tests done in the last few days show Justus, 37, was
born with brain damage that was worsened by head injuries when he
was 20. A petition urging Wilder to halt the execution also said
Justus was a victim of child abuse.
   Earlier in the day, Justus asked his victims' families to
forgive him and urged an end to the death penalty.
   ``I want it to be over with, not for me, but for the victims'
families,'' Justus said in a morning interview with WFIR radio in
Roanoke. ``I'm ready to go to a better place. I want it to be put
to rest.''
   ``I've asked for forgiveness to a lot of people and I was able
to forgive myself,'' Justus said.
   An hour before the execution, several death-penalty opponents
had gathered outside the penitentiary.
   One of those was the Rev. John Doddie, the penitentiary's Roman
Catholic chaplain, who said he had spent some time with Justus
earlier in the evening and found him to be in a somber mood.
   ``What we are experiencing tonight is ritualized evil,'' Doddie
said.
   Julie McConnell, executive director of the Virginia Association
to Abolish the Death Penalty, said candlelight vigils were being
held in six Virginia cities to protest the execution.
   Justus was sentenced to death in Virginia for the 1978 rape and
slaying of a pregnant Montgomery County nurse. Justus also was
sentenced to death for killing two women in Florida and Georgia.
   Justus was convicted of raping and shooting Ida Mae Moses, 21,
on Oct. 3, 1978, when she was nearly nine months pregnant. He also
received death sentences for murdering Rosemary Jackson, 32, in
Gwinnett County, Ga., and Stephanie Hawkins, 21, in Tampa, Fla.,
that same month.

<TEXT>
   In a 24-hour diplomatic blitz, Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze pressed for peaceful settlement of
conflicts in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
   In between, he negotiated details of a strategic arms treaty,
won long-sought U.S. trade concessions and sealed a date for the
next superpower summit.
   The soft-spoken, silver-haired Soviet Georgian has achieved star
status on the world stage as a troubleshooter par excellence.
   He has helped reverse the image of the Soviet Union as a
hostile, suspicious and nakedly aggressive world power and now
seeks a role as peacemaker and mediator of disputes in the world's
diplomatic hot spots.
   Keeping a schedule as frenetic as those of his counterpart,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, and of President Bush
himself, Shevardnadze announced Tuesday night after two days of
talks with Baker in Houston that the Kremlin would stop arming the
Afghan government that its troops propped up for years.
   On Wednesday morning, before meeting with Bush to seal a
February summit date and work out a program of limited U.S. aid for
his country's battered economy, Shevardnadze sat down for peace
talks with the anti-communist rebel leader whose forces have been
at war with the Soviet-backed government in Angola for 15 years.
   And after his White House talks with Bush, he headed for a
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who was in
Washington to see the president but agreed to a hastily arranged
talk with Shevardnadze as well.
   ``The Soviets clearly are attempting to engage in the industrial
world as partners, rather than enemies,'' said John D. Steinbruner,
director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. ``We've been skeptical and reluctant and sort of
mumbled about it.
   ``Now they have something that we need, which is approval for
what we're doing in the Persian Gulf, and they're providing it, and
that gives them an occasion to further their agenda, which is to
overcome their own isolation and try to get out of the problem of
being the opposing alliance all by themselves,'' Steinbruner said.
   Shevardnadze, whose reputation as a mediator and dealmaker is
not unlike that of Baker, has developed a relationship with his
American counterpart that ranges from serious bargaining in search
of middle ground to joking through interpreters about the
complexities of their task.
   They are fellow Southerners who enjoy the outdoors and the most
difficult challenges posed by their leaders. Baker has come to call
Shevardnadze his friend.
   In a revealing discussion earlier this year on his approach to
foreign policy, Shevardnadze lamented that his country poured money
and resources into southern Africa and elsewhere for decades but
has little to show for it now. Instead of schools and hospitals, he
said, the beneficiaries have guns and bloodshed, backwardness and
poverty.
   It was not, he said, a recod of which one can feel proud. But
it is one that will take years to undo.

<TEXT>
   America's newest national newspaper is edited
by an ex-convict for those who are still behind bars. Its avowed
aim: to help them stay out when they get out.
   The first issue of Inside Journal, a project of Watergate figure
Charles Colson's Prison Fellowship organization, is in the mail for
distribution to inmates from California to Connecticut.
   The eight-page paper - beginning as a quarterly with the aim of
monthly publication by 1992 - got generally good marks during a
sneak preview this week in the chapel of the District of Columbia's
suburban Lorton Reformatory.
   One inmate, Garfield Wells, who said he had been in another
prison before Lorton, asked whether the paper would take on touchy
issues such as prisoner complaints about the quality of medical
care and food.
   ``We are going to address difficult issues like that,'' said
senior editor Craig Pruitt. ``We are going to do it carefully, in
such a way that we can continue to address those difficult issues.
It's not going to be a fluff piece.''
   Some of the dozen or so inmates who took part, out of 12,000 in
the prison, said they thought more of the writing ought to be done
by prisoners.
   ``This is a natural think tank, a laboratory of men who have had
nothing but time to think,'' said inmate James Leak. ``We prisoners
are the best observers of the inside of the laboratory.''
   Pruitt told the Lorton residents that inmates in a number of
states gave advice on the paper's design, and future issues will
contain inmate contributions.
   The second issue will feature a poem by a prisoner in
Pennsylvania, he said.
   Pruitt said he spent more than 15 years in business before being
convicted of income tax fraud and serving two years in Seagoville
Federal Prison in Texas: ``Two years out of my life that I will
never forget.''
   The editor has written freelance articles for religious
publications and worked as a religious broadcaster, but is not a
journalist by background. He has a staff of two assisting him and
says this probably will double in the next six months.
   The Prison Fellowship is an evangelical organization aimed at
bringing Christianity to prison inmates. Like all of its projects,
the paper is supported by charitable contributions. It accepts no
advertising.
   ``I don't think we would interest many advertisers, since
prisoners don't have any money to buy their products,'' said James
W. Jewell, the group's senior vice president for communications.
   Pruitt said articles on Christian themes will make up 25 percent
of the paper's content.
   ``We don't want to be overwhelming the reader with that,'' he
said. ``We are walking the line of our Christian beliefs, but we
are also putting out a paper that is not a religious tract.''
   ``Our primary goal is to provide inmates with resources for life
in prison and so that, once released, they will never set foot in
prison again,'' Colson said in a news release on the launching of
the newspaper.
   The former White House aide served seven months in the Maxwell
Air Force Base prison in Montgomery, Ala., after pleading guilty to
obstruction of justice in connection with a case involving Pentagon
Papers figure Daniel Ellsberg.
   The newspaper's first issue features a front-page article about
the conversion of a Montana inmate who attends a chapel service
where Colson speaks, a piece on pop star Stevie Wonder's visit to a
Maryland prison, and a reprint of a story quoting Gov. James
Blanchard saying Michigan will build no more prisons after 1991.
   It also offers advice on how to write a letter to a loved one
and information from the Social Security Administration on benefits
available to released prisoners.
   Jewell, who has a degree in journalism, said all articles for
the newspaper are reviewed by two advisory boards, one of inmates
and one of correctional officials.
   ``We are editorially independent of any department of
corrections,'' he said. But if the correctional advisory board
unanimously advised against running an article, he said, the
editors might consider pulling it.
   ``We are just fully aware of who our gatekeepers are,'' he said.
``The paper won't be very effective if it can't get in.''
   Jewell said the organization distributed 88,000 of the papers to
prisons in Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana and
Pennsylvania as well as at Lorton.
   It eventually aims to reach 300,000 prisoners, about half of the
prison population, by 1992.
   ``I know from being in prison myself that people will read
anything they can get their hands on,'' Colson said in a telephone
interview from his Reston, Va., office. ``So we figure this will
have a long shelf life in the prisons. It will get passed around.''

<HEAD>Reformers Gain Places In Angolan Party Leadership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling party has voted leading
reformers onto its decision-making political bureau, advancing the
president's plan to change Angola's Marxist-inspired political
system into a pluralist democracy.
   The 21-member bureau is the highest executive institution of
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' party, the Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola.
   The move Wednesday by the ruling MPLA's 90-member central
committee came three days after a national congress of the party
voted to end its 15-year power monopoly and introduce multiparty
democracy by March.
   That move is expected to spur negotiations to end the long civil
war between government forces and U.S.-backed rebels. The conflict
has ravaged the country since independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The central committee voted to increase the number of political
bureau members from 12, and voted in 10 new members.
   Some hard-line members kept their positions, and diplomats in
the Angolan capital said dos Santos could still encounter
resistance to his reform plans.
   Dos Santos was re-elected chief of the political bureau.
   His personal political adviser, Lopo de Nascimento, considered a
leading reformer, was elected to the bureau and was voted chairman
of a commission to revise the party's statutes and program in
preparation for multiparty politics.
   Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro van Dunem was dropped as a full
bureau member and now is one of four alternates. He is Angola's
chief delegate in Washington talks with U.S. and Soviet officials
on the peace process.
   Van Dunem met Wednesday with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III. At the same time, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
had an unprecedented meeting with rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.
   The Kremlin and Washington still supply arms to their allies in
Angola, but recently joined Portugal in diplomatic efforts to seek
an end to the civil war.
   The Angolan government and UNITA - the rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola - are expected to meet January in
Portugal for a sixth round of peace talks.
   Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, Portugal's secretary of state for
foreign affairs and cooperation and its senior mediator at the
negotiations, said Tuesday the two sides could sign a cease-fire at
the January talks.

<HEAD>Writers Plead for Congress to Keep U.S. Out of Gulf War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The letters range from lengthy single-spaced
dissertations to handwritten pleas on flowered stationery, but many
say the same thing: please keep our country out of a Persian Gulf
war.
   ``I'm not a liberal. I'm an old right-wing conservative. But I
just don't see the need for a war over there,''James Abbott said in
explaining why he sent a 10-page opus to every member of the
Colorado congressional delegation plus the Democratic leadership of
the House and Senate.
   ``Only a special session ... can have a chance to call off this
impending holocaust,'' wrote Abbott, 53. ``If Congress fails to
act, THE BODY BAGS ARE COMING HOME. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM!''
   Abbott, a Wheatridge, Colo., geologist in the gold-mining
business, told the lawmakers he served in the Navy and does not
oppose war when used as a last resort to protect U.S. interests.
   But he added that it is ``disgusting ... to watch a phony war
being created right before our eyes'' and ``even more disgusting''
to see Congress' inaction. ``Please try to stop this tragic
occurrence,'' he wrote.
   Abbott's letter was among dozens received in the past few weeks
by the offices of Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a senior member
of the House Armed Services Committee.
   A well-known liberal, Mrs. Schroeder is one of 45 House members
who have filed a suit to try to force President Bush to get
permission from Congress before going to war.
   Other members of the Armed Services Committee with more
conservative views declined to let a reporter see their gulf mail
or ask the senders if their letters could be read or their names
used.
   The White House refused to comment either on the volume of
gulf-related mail or whether it has tended to be supportive or
critical.
   For the most part, Mrs. Schroeder's mail reflects the concerns
of people who disagree with Bush and think Congress is not doing
enough to avert bloodshed.
   ``Please help keep us out of a war,'' begged a Fort Collins,
Colo., retiree who did not want her name disclosed. ``With patience
and time surely sanctions would succeed. Why should people be
killed because someone ran out of patience?''
   ``The American people do not want another Vietnam, nor do they
want us to police the world. This is an Arab matter and should be
left to the Arabs involved to reach a decision,'' wrote William M.
McMechen, 35, a chemical engineer from Denver.
   World War II veteran Trigg A. Shelton of Englewood, Colo.,
wondered why the United States would intervene to protect Kuwait
from Iraqi aggression when it did not do the same for Iran a decade
ago.
   And if oil rather than a principle is at stake, wrote the
retired mail carrier, ``can we justify all those lost lives for
about 4 percent of the oil we use here in the United States? Can we
manage without that oil better than we can manage without those
precious lives?''
   ``These are hard questions, Mrs. Schroeder, but they need to be
asked,'' Shelton concluded. ``And they need answers BEFORE we get
into a shooting war.''
   One correspondent had no such reservations.
   ``The real villain in the gulf is us,'' wrote commodities trader
Gene W. Edwards, 47, of Denver. ``We supported (Iraq's Saddam)
Hussein during his war with Iran ... Now we must deal with the
monster we created and the only terms must be unconditional
surrender. Either we must bomb Iraq flat'' or occupy it.
   Another man, an Air Force veteran and retired nuclear medicine
technician, sent Mrs. Schroeder a copy of a letter in which he
asked Bush to get better treatment for his son and others serving
in Saudi Arabia.
   The writer, Charles R. Woltz of Lakewood, Colo., complained
about Saudi restrictions on the clothing, religious observances and
entertainment of U.S. troops. He said his son Troy, 19, is being
treated as ``a dishonored interloper'' in a country he is trying to
protect.
   ``If my only son must end the Woltz line and give his life for
our country, I believe he and the rest of the troops should be
accorded a little of the warm fuzzies they deserve,'' Woltz wrote.
``Please intercede.''

   Two workers were injured and exposed
to radioactive contamination in an explosion at a uranium
processing plant outside Frankfurt, authorities said.
   The blast occurred early Wednesday and authorities said they had
not immediately determined its cause. The facility, in the city of
Hanau, is owned by the giant German manufacturing concern, Siemens
AG.
   Annette Grossbongardt, spokeswoman for Hesse state Environment
Ministry, said one worker was severely injured and another was
slightly hurt. A third was reported treated for shock.
   Siemens spokesman Rainer Jend said the two injured workers had
been lightly contaminated with radioactive materials but the extent
of the exposure was still unclear.
   He said damage at the facility, which produces nuclear fuel, was
estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

<HEAD>Bush to Go to Moscow, Give Soviets Up to $1 Billion in Food Aid</HEAD>

   President Bush will go to Moscow for his
fourth summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev in February and is helping
the Soviet leader feed his people with up to $1 billion in credit
to purchase food.
   The deliveries could be on their way within two months, even as
bitter winter deepens the hardships the Soviets are experiencing as
Gorbachev tries to lead them from communism to a market economy.
   ``I want perestroika (restructuring) to succeed,'' Bush said
Wednesday as he announced what the White House described as the
largest initial assistance package the United States has ever
offered any country.
   Standing at the president's side, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze acknowledged his nation is going through rough
times. But, he said, ``the Soviet people will cope with the
problems.''
   The package includes technical help in reforming a stagnant
transportation system, medicines and support in access to
international lending institutions.
   The summit, meanwhile, was scheduled for Feb. 11-13 in Moscow
even though the nuclear arms reduction treaty that is its projected
centerpiece is not finished.
   Bush had vowed not to hold the summit unless the accord was
ready. But a White House official said that did not preclude
setting a date to meet with Gorbachev.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has worked on the
treaty with Shevardnadze in Houston and in Washington this week,
said a number of technical issues remain unresolved.
   These include monitoring of solid rocket and missile assembly
facilities to guard against breaches in the accord, which will cut
stockpiles of long-range nuclear bombers, submarines and missiles
by about 30 percent.
   But Bush said, ``I'm pleased with the great progress we've made
on START (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks) and hopeful that we'll be
ready to sign a treaty'' in Moscow.
   In the meantime, the president suspended at least until next
June 16-year-old trade restrictions that Congress had imposed on
the Soviet Union to try to force emigration of Jews and other
minorities.
   Baker said the U.S. assistance program would include credits for
$500 million to $1 billion in food shipments. That is more than
Shevardnadze requested Tuesday in their talks in Houston, said a
U.S. official who briefed reporters under rules shielding his
identity.
   ``The Soviet Union is facing tough times, difficult times. But I
believe that this is good reason to act now in order to help the
Soviet Union stay the course of democratization and to undertake
market reforms,'' Bush said.
   The target for about 40 years of U.S. invective and a massive
military buildup, the Soviets lately have been on friendly terms
with the United States, including supporting Bush's drive to force
Iraq to reverse its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   But Baker told reporters: ``You shouldn't consider any of the
steps taken toay to be a payoff or payback for cooperation on the
(Persian) Gulf.''
   One step Bush did not take was to recommend the lifting of high
tariffs against Soviet imports. But he and Baker hinted that may
come after the Soviet parliament makes good on a longstanding
promise to liberalize its emigration laws. Already, Jews and other
minorities are being permitted to leave the country in record
numbers.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Bush's decision to
provide aid was in the American tradition of responding to human
needs and also could give American farmers a ``major boost.''
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who was
criticized by the White House nine months ago for recommending the
kind of steps Bush now has taken, commented: ``America cannot stand
on the sidelines as the Cold War era ends and the Soviet Union
struggles to find its future.''
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said: ``The very moment that
Gorbachev is considered to be the most disliked man in the Soviet
Union is scarcely a sensible time to give his government
credibility and financial support by the American taxpayers.''
   And Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., said, ``It's a mistake to waive
the Jackson-Vanik restrictions in order to allow more subsidies and
loan guarantees.'' He said such a move ``puts new burdens on
American taxpayers and does little, if anything, to relieve hunger
in the Soviet Union.''

   Here is a brief look at the operation of the

the amendment on Wednesday to permit food sales on credit to the
Soviet Union.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   JACKSON-VANIK: The amendment to the 1974 U.S. Trade Act,
sponsored by the late Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., and former Rep.
Charles Vanik, D-Ohio, prohibits preferential tariffs or access to
U.S. credits to any nation that denies its citizens the right to
emigrate.
   WAIVER: The law allows a waiver of the amendment if the
president believes the emigration restrictions have been eased. Any
waiver must be renewed every June, when Congress could restore the
waiver.
   EMIGRATION: Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has lifted
virtually all restrictions on the emigration of Jews from the
Soviet Union. Some 150,000 have left for Israel over the past year.
But the Supreme Soviet has not yet passed legislation that would
anchor Gorbachev's emigration reforms in Soviet law. Bush said he
hoped such legislation would pass soon.
   CREDITS: Bush's waiver gives two government agencies, the
Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corp., authority to
guarantee bank loans to back American exports to the Soviet Union -
in effect, to co-sign the Soviets' IOUs.
   The Commodity Credit Corp., an agency of the Agriculture
Department, provides loan guarantees for sales of agricultural
products while the Export-Import Bank, an independent agency,
provides guarantees for sales of U.S. manufactured goods.
   The Soviets had agreed to buy about about 1.2 million tons of
wheat and about 600,000 tons of corn in the final three months of
this year, for cash. However, U.S. farm groups feared that the
Soviets, caught in a cash squeeze because of their failing economy,
would not be able to buy those grains without credit.
   MOST FAVORED NATION: A waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment
also is necessary for granting the Soviets ``most-favored-nation''
trade status. That would allow Soviet exports to the United States
to qualify for the lowet tariffs granted to any other nation for
the commodity in question.
   Soviet products carry tariffs that are as much as 10 times
higher than the duties levied on similar products from other
countries.
   The Soviets will not get the most-favored tariffs until both
houses of Congress approve a new trade agreement. The agreement was
signed by Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev last June but
the administration has not yet submitted it to Congress for
approval.

<HEAD>Mobil Suspends Exploration After Rebel Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mobil Oil Corp. has temporarily suspended its
search for oil in Peru's jungle after an attack by leftist rebels
destroyed a jungle surveying camp it had operated.
   The attack this week was the most serious against Peru's oil
industry in 10 years of political violence, as well as the largest
ever against a foreign company in Peru.
   The Lima offices of multinational corporations are often the
target of rebel bombs but damage is usually slight.
   Peru's energy minister, Fernando Sanchez Albavera, said
Wednesday that New York-based Mobil would resume its survey
operations in six to eight months with Peru's army providing
protection for the surveyers.
   ``It is very important the contract be respected,'' Sanchez told
a news conference. ``It is an example for investors throughout the
world.''
   But a Mobil spokesman refused to say when exploration would be
resumed.
   Pro-Cuban rebels on Monday took over Mobil's survey camp in the
Upper Huallaga valley, 270 miles northeast of Lima.
   The rebels, from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Group, blew up
vehicles, equipment and buildings and stole a helicopter. No one
was hurt in the camp, operated by a Mobil subcontractor, the
Halliburton Geophysical Service.
   Sanchez said the rebels caused $2 to $3 million in damages.
   A newspaper with close ties to the Tupac Amaru group last week
harshly criticized the Mobil operation. The paper called the
exploration contract a ``swindle'' and said it allows Mobil to
``carry away all the profits.''
   The Upper Huallaga is the world's main source the raw material
of cocaine. Hundreds of rebels from both the Tupac Amaru group and
the more radical Shining Path movement operate in the area.
   In September 198, Mobil signed a contract with the state oil
company Petroperu to explore four lots in the Huallaga.
   Mobil has already spent $15 million to explore the area, and the
contract obliges Mobil to spend at least $107.5 million.
   The roughly 650 Halliburton employees at the survey camp were
left at least temporarily without jobs, Sanchez said. Reports from
the zone said most workers have fled the camp.
   The Mobil spokesman said that before the attack the company had
stationed guards at the camp only to ``deter petty theft.'' He said
the camp would not reopen until the armed forces agree to protect
the workers.
   Peru produces some 132,000 barrels of oil per day. An oil
exporter in the mid 1980s, Peru had to import oil by the end of the
decade.
   Between 1981 and 1989, Peru's proven reserves fell by more than
half, from 835.2 to 405.9 million barrels. But foreign companies
have shown renewed interest in Peru after the government changed
exploration regulations in 1987.

   Americans who skip today's last U.S.-sponsored
flight from Iraq will still be able get American help in leaving
the Middle East nation or neighboring Kuwait, the State Department
says.
   The last planned U.S.-sponsored charter was leaving Iraq today
with at least 15 people on board. Th plane was heading to
Frankfurt, Germany, for a stopover before the Americans return to
the United States.
   U.S. officials estimate that about 500 Americans - most of them
children with dual citizenship - have opted to remain in Kuwait or
Iraq.
   Anyone who decides to leave at a later time can fly out by
commercial Iraqi airliner, State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said Wednesday.
   Iraqi airways has started twice-daily flights between Kuwait
City and Baghdad, he said. Once in Iraq, officials at the U.S.
Embassy will expedite departures through Jordan.
   ``There are ways of getting out of Kuwait in the future,''
Boucher said.
   The embassy in occupied Kuwait will be closed ``once we are
confident that all Americans who want to leave Kuwait have done
so,'' Boucher added. Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and his staff had
been under siege at the embassy since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   About 188 Americans have been evacuated from Iraq and Kuwait
over the last week. They include 70 people who were in hiding, 86
men kept as so-called ``human shields'' at strategic sites in Iraq
and 32 private citizens holed up at the embassies in Kuwait and
Iraq.
   Meantime, the administration accused Iraq of blocking agreement
on dates for diplomatic talks between the two countries.
   Iraq has asked that Secretary of State James A. Baker III visit
Baghdad on Jan. 12, but the United States said that is too close to
Jan. 15, the deadline set by the United Nations Security Council to
authorize military force if the Iraqis have not left Kuwait.
   President Bush proposed a diplomatic exchange - including a
White House meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz - as a
last-ditch effort to find a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis,
and Iraq accepted the idea.
   However, Boucher said, ``We have offered 15 dates and Iraq has
offered none. ... Iraq continues to block agreement on dates.''
   Iraq has suggested that its foreign minister come to Washington
to see Bush on Dec. 17. Boucher said the United States would not
accept that date unless a date had been fixed for Baker's trip to
Iraq.

   The head of the Federal Railroad
Administration says the fact no one was killed in the collision of
an Amtrak passenger train and a commuter train in Boston proves
that modern railroad equipment is crashworthy and saves lives.
   FRA Administrator Gilbert E. Carmichael said that is true even
though 264 people were injured when the passenger train from
Washington derailed and rammed the commuter train in Boston's Back
Bay station Wednesday.
   ``This is a beautiful demonstration of how an accident in the
railroad industry can shake up a lot of people and injure people
but also save lives; there were no fatalities,'' Carmichael said in
an interview.
   ``This accident was dramatic; it was a messy accident,''
Carmichael said. ``But the trains performed beautifully in
protecting people. The equipment performed as it was designed. And
it is designed to take it.''
   Carmichael noted that only a handful of those injured required
hospitalization. Both locomotives derailed and were damaged beyond
repair, he said.
   Meanwhile, investigators for the National Transportation Safety
Board said they were probing possible similarities between
Wednesday's accident and a 1987 crash in which two commuter trains
collided in the same Boston station.
   Carmichael said inspectors from his agency also were looking
into the cause of the derailment and collision.
   ``At this point it's a mystery,'' Carmichael said, adding that
it may take several days to learn what went wrong.
   The FRA also subjected the train crews to alcohol and drug
tests, mandatory after all serious rail accidents. The results will
not be available for several days.
   In Wednesday's accident, Amtrak's Night Owl passenger train from
Washington smashed into the crowded commuter train during the
morning rush hour.
   Amtrak said the Night Owl apparently ``derailed on a curve and
went into the side of the ... train on an adjacent track.''
   In the 1987 Boston accident, an Amtrak-operated, Massachusetts
Bay Transportation Authority commuter train was standing at the
platform of the Back Bay station unloading passengers during
morning rush hour. It was struck from the rear by another
Amtrak-operated commuter train.
   That accident injured 110 people.
   After an investigation, the NTSB concluded that the probable
cause of the accident was the display of an improper wayside signal
resulting from an improperly designed signal system.
   It also blamed the failure of an engineer to act on a danger
signal and the failure of Amtrak supervisors to follow up on
reported signal failures.
   ``We will be looking at the 1987 accident and this one to see if
there are any similarities,'' said safety board spokesman Brent N.
Bahler.
   The board investigates all major transportation accidents in the
United States, pinpoints a probable cause for each and makes
corrective but non-binding recommendations.
   NTSB officials pointed out that a 1987 board recommendation,
calling for a federal rule requiring installation of a control
system on mainline tracks to provide for the positive separation of
all trains, has never been implemented.
   The recommendation emerged from investigations of several
serious rail accidents in the last few years, including the Jan. 4,
1987 crash of an Amtrak passenger train and Conrail freight
locomotives at Chase, Md., near Baltimore.
   That accident, the worst in Amtrak's history, killed 16 people
and injured 175.

   Downing two warplanes with
surface-to-air missiles during a 3-week-old offensive, guerrillas
have eroded military morale and prompted Washington to rush tens of
millions in aid to the government.
   The leftist rebels' successful use of SAMS has also provided
fodder for government officials determined to gain restoration of
other military aid that was recently slashed by the U.S. Congress.
   U.S. sources working with the Salvadoran air force, speaking
anonymously, said the Salvadoran high command wants Washington to
provide more-sophisticated Cobra attack helicopters to replace
downed or damaged Vietnam-era ``Hueys.'' The Hueys have been the
right-wing government's most significant tactical advantage in the
11-year-old civil war.
   On Nov. 23, guerrillas shot down an A-37 attack jet in the
eastern province of Usulutan. It was the first time in the war the
rebels had brought down a warplane with a missile.
   They did it again Dec. 4, downing an AC-47 in the northern
province of Chalatenango.
   Rebel ground fire brought down a UH-1M helicopter in Usulutan on
Nov. 26 and a UH-1H helicopter near the Honduran border on
Wednesday. The armed forces said one helicopter gunner was killed
in the second incident.
   Rebel commander Jorge Melendez, on the clandestine insurgent
radio, said U.S. protests over the use of missiles are ``cynical
and shameless.''
   He noted it was the United States, in supplying Nicaraguan
Contra rebels with ``Redeyes'' during the 1980s, that introduced
sophisticated surface-to-air missiles to the region.
   Rebel spokesman Miguel Saenz acknowledged that the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, has acquired Soviet-made
SA-7s, SA-14s and Redeyes.
   The Salvadoran and U.S. governments contend the missiles were
supplied during the past 13 months by Nicaraguan Sandinistas.
   Rebel commanders admit privately that some missiles have been
provided by their Sandinista allies. But they also say they have
bought black market Redeyes from demobilized Contras.
   Conversations with air force pilots, infantry officers who
depend on air support and U.S. technicians who work with the air
force indicate pilot morale is at its lowest point of the war.
   ``They're scared. They're walking around Ilopango with their
eyebrows up in the middle of their foreheads,'' said one U.S.
technician, imitating a wide-eyed fearful face.
   An A-37 pilot admitted privately, ``We're worried.'' He
described missile evasion tactics being practiced daily over the
A-37s' base at the international airport on the Pacific coast, a
region normally free of rebel activity.
   An infantry lieutenant said his troops went hungry at times and
were low on ammunition because helicopter pilots feared landing in
zones where rebel anti-aircraft fire was likely.
   On Tuesday, an entire 11-man patrol of the elite Bracamonte
infantry battalion surrendered to rebels in Chalatenango after
finding itself surrounded and bereft of air support, according to
rebel and army sources.
   On Wednesday, about 200 soldiers, some seriously wounded,
retreated into neighboring Honduras after battling with rebels, the
Honduran government said.
   The U.S. Congress in October cut in half the $85 million in
military aid previously allotted for fiscal 1991.
   The reduction was intended to push the armed forces toward a
negotiated peace settlement. The cut was also to express
displeasure with military stonewalling of the investigation into
the November 1989 murder by army troops of six Jesuit
priest-educators, their housekeeper and her daughter.
   On Nov. 20, the rebels began stepping up the pace of combat in
what they said was a campaign to force the government into
concessions at the negotiating table and punish the armed forces
for human rights abuses.
   On Friday, the State Department announced that delivery of $48.1
million in military aid was being speeded up in response to ``the
serious new escalation in FMLN guerrilla offensive actions.''
   The funds included $10.6 million left over from last year and
$37.5 million from the fiscal 1991 account.
   The U.S. legislation cutting military aid in half provides for
restoration of the slashed $42.5 million if the rebels fail to
negotiate peace in good faith, launches an offensive that threatens
to topple the government or receives large amounts of lethal
military eqiupment from abroad.
   ``The introduction of sophisticated armament that clearly comes
from Nicaragua or Cuba ... should be one of the elements the U.S.
Congress will have to examine and because of that we predict that,
God willing, the frozen aid will be restored,'' said Ernesto
Altschul, vice-minister of the presidency, in an interview.

   The release handle on an DC-9 emergency exit
wasn't working during a fire that swept the jet after a runway
collision, federal investigators say. A newspaper said the failure
cost two people their lives.
   The two - a flight attendant and a passenger whose bodies
reportedly were found in the tail section near the exit - were
among eight people killed in the collision on Dec. 3 between the
Northwest jet and a Northwest Boeing 727.
   National Transportation Safety Board official John Lauber said
Wednesday that investigators found that the handle that pops off
the tail cone and deploys an emergency slide did not work, and that
the stem of the handle was broken.
   The NTSB wouldnt speculate on how the handle became broken,
whether anyone actually tried to operate it or whether the
equipment was to blame for any deaths.
   With the investigation of the Dec. 3 accident still going on,
NTSB spokesman Alan Pollock said, ``We can't get into that kind of
analysis at this time.''
   However, The Detroit News, citing an unidentified investigator,
reported Wednesday that the flight attendant and passenger tried to
escape through the hatch but died after the release jammed and
trapped them.
   The investigator told the News the bodies of 22-year flight
attendant Heidi Joost, 43, of Dearborn, and Kingsley Brown, 30, a
passenger from Pittsburgh, were found a few feet from the release
lever.
   Lauber said the handle ``was found partially raised from its
stowed position,'' and the stem of the handle was broken.
   The 727 was racing toward takeoff when it struck the taxiing
DC-9, which had turned in front of it. The 153 people aboard the
727 escaped injury.
   ``The NTSB did not interpret the findings, and neither can
Northwest,'' the airline said in a statement.
   The airline checked the tail-cone release mechanisms on all its
DC-9s Sunday and Monday ```to ensure ourselves of the dependability
of those units, and we assured ourselves of that,'' said spokesman
Bob Gibbons.

   Von Smeltzer didn't like his job and
wanted to join the military, but didn't want to go to the Persian
Gulf. So he joined the Coast Guard.
   He's among about 4,000 people passing through Cape May this year
for eight weeks in the nation's only Coast Guard recruit training
center.
   That's up from 3,500 in 1989, but center commander Scott Burhoe
said it's unclear if more people have chosen the guard over other
services because of the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf.
   That did happen the last time the nation was in a major
conflict, he said.
   ``During the Vietnam War, the Coast Guard took in some pretty
bright people,'' Burhoe said.
   Smeltzer, 20, of Myrtle Beach, S.C., said he had been looking
for a better job.
   ``I was breaking my back as a UPS loader. I could have made good
money there, but I wasn't enjoying it,'' he said. ``The Persian
Gulf situation distracted me from the other armed services.''
   Recruits are told before they ever get to the center, however,
that they might be called on in war, Burhoe said.
   Up to 600 active-duty and reserve guardsmen now are serving on
naval vessels in the Persian Gulf area, a spokesman for the service
said. Most are specialists in boarding vessels and looking for
contraband.
   During peacetime, the Coast Guard takes orders from the
Transportation Department. When Congress declares war, the guard
comes under Navy jurisdiction.
   The 200-year-old guard's peacetime mission is to protect the
nation's waters and the people and boats plying them.
   Recruits average 19 or 20 years old, but some are as young as 17
and others are in their mid-20s, Burhoe said. About 10 percent are
women.
   During boot camp, they'll get short haircuts, undergo a battery
of health exams and physical fitness tests and learn everything
from tying a square knot and marching in formation to
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and firing weapons.
   Officials say four out of five recruits will graduate into the
ranks of seaman apprentice and serve a four-year stint in the
guard, followed by four years in the reserve.
   Marcy Onos, 25, of Peabody, Mass., said she was attracted to the
guard's environmental duties, like helping clean up the Exxon
Valdez oil spill in Alaska and repeated smaller spills in New York
harbor.
   ``I was interested in marine science technology,'' she said.
   Yves Meillarec, 21, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said, ``I was
checking into all of the services. The Coast Guard at the same time
had education and the water.''
   ``I didn't want to get stuck in Montana,'' he said.

   For the second time in a year, USAir cargo
workers have rejected the Teamsters' efforts to represent them.
   In a ballot count announced Wednesday by the Federal Mediation
Board, only 2,475 of the 7,200 airline workers eligible to vote
backed the Teamsters. The union needed 3,600 votes.
   The election was an all-or-nothing event for the Teamsters, who
already represented some 2,000 USAir workers in Pittsburgh,
Philadelphia, Buffalo and Boston. Wednesday's loss means those
workers will no longer be Teamster members.
   The bulk of USAir workers simply didn't bother to vote, thereby
siding with the Arlington, Va.-based carrier, the Mediation Board
said.
   In January, the Teamsters failed at their first effort to
organize USAir workers at 180 airports when, as in Wednesday's
election, most workers didn't vote.
   However, the Mediation Board later ruled that the Teamsters
deserved another try, saying the airline's anti-union campaign
illegally ``tainted'' the first election.
   Even before Wednesday's ballot count, the Teamsters had filed
charges with the board alleging that USAir had illegally interfered
with their second organizing drive, too. The board has given the
Teamsters until Jan. 3 to file additional evidence and USAir until
Jan. 23 to file its response.
   USAir spokeswoman Susan Young said the carrier was confident it
would be found innocent of any wrongdoing in the second election.
She said that in urging workers not to vote for Teamsters
representation in the latest election, the airline tried to show
that workers don't need a union.
   ``We have good employee-management relations ... We simply felt
that employees had nothing to gain from Teamsters representation,''
Young said.
   The Teamsters had no immediate comment, according to an official
who answered the phone at the union's airline division in New York.
   After the first election, the Teamsters had charged that USAir
unfairly interfered with their organizing drive by calling meetings
with small groups of workers to discuss the union's campaign,
putting up anti-Teamsters posters urging workers to burn their
ballots and producing anti-Teamsters videotapes.
   The board agreed with the Teamsters, clearing the way for
Wednesday's election. USAir denied any wrongdoing.
   The Teamsters had represented cargo workers at USAir before its
1989 merger with Piedmont airlines, whose employees were not
members of the union.
   A year ago, the Mediation Board ordered the first election to
determine whether workers at USAir and former Piedmont employees
would be represented by the Teamsters. Three other unions
representing pilots, flight attendants and mechanics at USAir
gained the right to represent the Piedmont workers without
elections.

<HEAD>U.S. Farm Exports to Europe Expected to Hold Steady</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The export value of U.S. farm products to the
12-nation European Community will hold about steady in the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1, according to Agriculture Department
analysts.
   A breakdown of 1990-91 agricultural export estimate showed
shipments to the EC at $6.8 billion, compared with $6.827 billion
in the last fiscal year.
   ``In 1991, lower cotton and meat exports are expected to offset
gains in horticultural and other high-value products'' sold to the
EC, said the report released Wednesday.
   Sales to all of Western Europe, including some non-EC countries,
was indicated at $7.3 billion, compared with $7.319 billion in
1989-90.
   Asia continues to be the dominant regional market for U.S. farm
products, although the total value is expected to drop to $15.4
billion from more than $16 billion in each of the two previous
years.
   Exports to Japan, the largest single-country foreign market, was
forecast at $8.1 billion, about the same as last year. The record
was $8.13 billion in fiscal 1989.
   ``Although in its longest post-war expansionary period, Japan's
economic outlook is clouded by higher crude oil prices, higher
interest rates and declining asset values,'' the report said.
   Higher interest rates could dampen Japan's capital spending,
which has propelled the current economic boom. Although Japanese
consumption has remained strong, the report said the stock market's
slide ``has reduced optimism'' about Japan's economy weathering oil
price increases.
   Canada is expected to buy $4 billion worth of U.S. agricultural
products in fiscal 1991, up from $3.71 billion last year.
   But the report said a change in bookkeeping indicates Canadian
imports probably were understated last year, meaning there will be
``no expected change'' in 1991.
   The forecast showed the value of commodities headed for the
Soviet Union this fiscal year at $2 billion, down from more than
$2.98 billion in 1989-90.
   However, that estimate was made before a new $1 billion credit
arrangement was announced Wednesday to help Moscow buy more grain
and other commodities.
   Looking at China, the report said there will be relatively low
demand for U.S. agricultural products due to the country's sluggish
economy, a rising budget deficit and ``two consecutive years of
extremely successful grain harvests.''
   Overall, China is expected to import only about $600 million
worth of U.S. agricultural products in 1990-91, down from $909
million last year - which was also down sharply.
   ``Reductions in the value of U.S. wheat and most other minor
agricultural product exports are forecast to more than offset
increased earnings from cotton, cattle hides and poultry
products,'' the report said.
   As a result of the embargo imposed for its invasion of Kuwait,
Iraq is not expected to have any U.S. agricultural shipments in
1990-91, the report said. Last fiscal year, before the Aug. 2
invasion, exports were about $496 million.
   Total U.S. agricultural exports in the current fiscal year are
forecast at $38.5 billion, down from $40.1 billion in 1989-90. That
overall forecast was announced by USDA on Nov. 27.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - If the Soviet Union or anyone else wants to
buy edible, dry beans, U.S. producers have had a bumper crop this
year.
   The Agriculture Department's latest estimate of 1990 production
is 32.6 million hundredweight, up 38 percent from last year and 70
percent more than two years ago, when drought cut yields in some
major areas.
   Department officials said this year's output of beans is just
short of the record harvest in 1981.
   ``A good finish in Michigan, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New
York and Wyoming boosted the average yield'' to 1,542 pounds per
acre from 1,437 last year, they said in a report. ``Minnesota and
North Dakota, coming out of a drought, show productions well above
the last two years.''
   Navy bean output jumped 57 percent from last year because of
record yields in Michigan and increased acreage harvested in
Minnesota and North Dakota, the report said. Great Northern bean
production recovered in Nebraska after and short crop last year.
   Pinto bean production was up 43 percent from 1989, and kidney
beans gained 38 percent from last year.
   ``Bumper crops in Michigan and New York more than doubled the
crop of black turtle soup beans,'' the report said. ``The output of
pink and small red beans remained strong, although both were below
a year ago. The small white bean crop continues to get smaller.''
   According to the department's November price report, the
all-bean price paid to growers averaged $18.20 per 100 pounds, down
from $27.70 a year earlier.

   The first person in the nation to be
prosecuted for hauling food in the same truck he had used to carry
garbage was fined $1,000.
   Howard L. Jones of New York City received the minimum possible
fine Wednesday in return for his testimony against the company that
hired him to haul garbage to the Midwest and carry corn meal on the
return trip back East.
   In sentencing Jones, Clarion County Magistrate Greg Long said
the corn meal can be fed to livestock but cannot be used for human
consumption.
   Inspectors said the corn meal was not been contaminated.
   Trucking a second cargo on return trips is known in the industry
as backhauling. In March, Pennsylvania banned backhauling food in
trucks used to haul garbage. President Bush signed a similar
federal law this fall.
   Jones, who was arrested in August, agreed to plead guilty on the
condition the state return the truck, which was owned by a company
not charged in the case.

<HEAD>Tightened Mortgage Standards to Hit Home Buyers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some home buyers will have a harder time
finding loans next spring because a major government-sponsored
mortgage buyer is tightening its standards.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie Mac, said
Wednesday that after March 31 it will stop buying two types of
mortgages: adjustable-rate loans with less than a 10 percent down
payment and low-documentation loans.
   The rule changes come as a growing number of lenders are
tightening credit terms on a variety of loans, creating what some
borrowers say is a credit crunch.
   In addition, after Jan. 2, Freddie Mac will more closely
scrutinize its purchases of loans originated by mortgage brokers
and other third parties working for lenders.
   The change on low-down-payment, adjustable-rate mortgages will
pinch first-time home buyers the most, consumer advocates and
economists say. The restriction on low-documentation mortgages
affects mostly buyers moving up to more expensive homes.
   Many renters, especially in high-cost areas on the East and West
coasts, can raise only a 5 percent down payment to purchase their
first home.
   ``Housing prices have gone up so much that ARMs (adjustable-rate
mortgages) have been about the only tool available to make it
possible for some people to buy a home,'' said Peggy Miller of the
Consumer Federation of America.
   ``It's bad not only for first-time home buyers,'' she said.
``ARMs offer at least some flexibility in difficult situations for
moderate-income people.''
   ``Very clearly it's going to mean that there are some folks that
could have gotten into the market that won't be able to get into
the market, but I don't think it's going to stop housing in its
tracks,'' said economist John A. Tuccillo of the National
Association of Realtors.
   More significant, he said, are the restrictions on third-party
loans. As many as one in four mortgages are originated by brokers
rather than directly by lenders, he said. The restrictions mean
fewer broker-originated loans will be accepted using streamlined
procedures.
   ``Freddie Mac has added additional layers of bureaucracy to the
mortgage process,'' said James Nelson, president of the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America.
   As the ultimate source of about one in every four home
mortgages, Freddie Mac and a sister organization have an enormous
impact on what types of mortgages lenders are willing to make.
   The Federal National Mortgage Association, Fannie Mae, will
continue to finance low-down-payment adjustable mortgages, but two
months ago it imposed restrictions on low-documentation loans.
   Both types of loans are considered riskier than standard
mortgages. For more than a year, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have
been pressured by the Treasury Department to tighten their
procedures generally.
   Although both have only limited government backing, most
investors assume they would be bailed out by the government if they
got into trouble.
   Freddie Mac spokeswoman Janice Conway said the ARM change
affects a limited number of loans and was a prudent move with real
estate prices in some areas and the national economy deteriorating.
   ``We're doing borrowers a service by helping them to keep their
homes rather than just getting them nnto the home,'' she said.
   However, Michelle Maier, an attorney with Consumer's Union, said
Freddie Mac could have adopted a less onerous approach by requiring
lenders to exercise more care in making low-down-payment ARMs
rather than excluding them completely.
   Freddie Mac estimates about 25 percent of the loans it is
purchasing this year will be low-documentation mortgages. It said 9
percent of the adjustable-rate loans in its portfolio are
low-down-payment mortgages.
   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are congressionally chartered but
stockholder-owned companies. They purchase loans from banks and
other lenders, retain some and repackage others into securities for
resale to investors.

<TEXT>
   A record store owner lashed out in
court with a few four-letter words before being fined $1,000 for
selling 2 Live Crew's ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' after the album
was ruled obscene.
   Before passing sentence Wednesday, Broward County Judge Paul
Backman asked Charles Freeman if he had anything to say.
   ``Yes, your honor, I'd like to say the prosecutors, you, this
whole ... court is out of ... order,'' Freeman said.
   The judge said he wouldn't hold the outburst against Freeman,
who apologized moments later.
   Freeman, 32, could have been received up to a year in jail on
the obscenity conviction for selling the recording to an undercover
deputy. He said he should never have been convicted at all.
   Three members of 2 Live Crew were acquitted of obscenity in
October for performing the songs, charges against a record store
owner in Texas were dropped earlier this week and an Alabama man's
conviction for selling the album was overturned in February.
   ``2 Live Crew walked away free. A man in Texas walked away free.
A man in Alabama walked away free,'' Freeman said. ``It's just
frustrating.''
   ``If you're angry at this entire situation from beginning to
end, as you may well be, I would suggest you channel that anger in
a different direction,'' the judge said, suggesting Freeman work to
change the law.
   The judge recommended that the fine be donated to a local
performing arts school.
   Prosecutor Pedro Dijols said he was satisfied with the sentence.
   Defense attorney Bruce Rogow said he will appeal.
   ``I think the judge recognized what a difficult thing it is to
determine obscenity,'' Rogow said. ``I think he also recognized the
irony of this case. The guys who make the music, sing it publicly,
get acquitted. But this guy, who sells a little cassette tape ...''
   In June, a federal judge in Fort Lauderdale pronounced ``As
Nasty As They Wanna Be'' obscene.
   Debbie Bennett, a spokeswoman for 2 Live Crew leader Luther
Campbell, did not immediately return calls for comment.
   Freeman, owner of E-C Records, was convicted in October by an
all-white jury. The defense had argued for a more diverse ethnic
and economic mix. Obscenity cases are decided on what jurors
determine community standards to be.

<HEAD>Chairman Of Thames TV and Former BBC Director-General Dead At 68</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Ian Trethowan, the chairman of Thames
Television and a former director-general of the British
Broadcasting Corp., died at age 68 a few hours after Thames said he
was retiring because of ill health.
   Trethowan, who died Wednesday night at London's Cromwell
Hospital, had fought a long battle with motor neurone disease, the
company said.
   A former political journalist and deputy editor of Independent
Television News, he was confined to a wheelchair because of his
illness, which progressively wastes the muscles.
   Thames, one of the companies in Britain's commercial Independent
Television Network, had announced earlier Wednesday that Trethowan
would be succeeded as chairman next month by movie producer Lord
Brabourne.
   Trethowan, who began work as a newspaper reporter in York in
northern England, had been chairman of Thames since 1987.
   Thames this year cut its staff from 2,000 to 1,500. The cut was
largely due to government insistence that in order to increase
competition, broadcasters should take 25 percent of their programs
from independent producers, apart from areas such as news and
current affairs.
   Thames, like other commercial TV companies, has also been hit by
a sharp fall in advertising revenues caused by the current economic
recession.
   Trethowan held the twin posts of deputy editor and political
editor of Independent Television News from 1958 to 1963 and then
joined the BBC as a commentator.
   He became director-general of the BBC in 1977 and held the post
until 1982. During that time, he resolutely defended the BBC
against criticism by the government of then-Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
   Government criticism centered on some BBC news coverage of
sectarian and political strife in Northern Ireland, BBC reporting
on British intelligence agencies and BBC reporting of the 1982
Falklands War, some of which, Mrs. Thatcher's government charged,
was biased in favor of Argentina.
   In 1988, Mrs. Thatcher's government banned British TV and radio
from broadcasting interviews with the outlawed Irish Republican
Army, its legal political arm Sinn Fein and with various Protestant
paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.
   Trethowan was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1980 in
recognition of his services to television journalism.
   His first marriage ended in divorce. He leaves his second wife
and three daughters.

   Mayor Xavier Suarez says he regrets the way Miami
handled Nelson Mandela's visit, but black activists say they will
keep boycotting the city until he apologizes for refusing to honor
the anti-apartheid leader.
   ``If it's gotten you to the point where you regret it, then why
don't you just go ahead and say, `I'm sorry, I apologize. We
screwed up. We messed up'? Now till you do that, then it is not
acceptable,'' said the Rev. Victor Curry.
   City officials refused to honor Mandela during visit in June
because the South African activist had praised Fidel Castro,
Moammar Gadhafi and Yasser Arafat. Miami's Cuban-Americans were
especially upset over Mandela's embrace of Castro.
   ``Words can barely begin to describe the pain I feel over the
division which has occurred since Nelson Mandela visited this
community,'' Suarez, breaking in long silence on the issue, said in
a statement. ``I search for a formula that adequately expresses my
regret that the matter was not handled better.''
   Suarez did not use the words ``apologize'' or ``I'm sorry.''
Asked later why not, he said: ``The problem with that statement is
that you are admitting that there's things you did that you
shouldn't have done.
   ``And frankly it's very difficult for me to conceive of anything
that we could have done better ... and of course we don't want to
get into the whole symbolic issue of what it means to quote-unquote
apologize under a demand,'' he said.
   The perceived snub of Mandela prompted black leaders on July 17
to start a boycott that has cost the city up to $25 million in
tourism and convention business. Getting an apology from city
officials is one of the boycott's goals.
   Business leaders supported the mayor.
   ``As Mayor Suarez said today, despite Mr. Mandela's statement
preceding his arrival in Miami, we as a community should have
offered a welcome more fully reflecting his extraordinary struggle
against tyranny in South Africa,'' read a statement from the city's
principal business, civic and education institutions.
   The Urban League on Wednesday became the first black group to
ignore the boycott when it convened its mid-winter meeting at a
Miami resort.
   John Jacobs, the group's national president, has said he
supports the local chapter, which voted this summer to oppose the
boycott because its organizers did not try to negotiate a
resolution first.

<HEAD>Aerospace Industry Sees Further Declines Despite Gulf Buildup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spending on aerospace weapons and employment
in the industry are expected to decline further despite the massive
military buildup in the Persian Gulf, a trade association executive
says.
   But ``a respectable level of defense activity'' will remain,
said Don Fuqua, president of the Aerospace Industries Association.
``The outlook is les than rosy, but not as dismal as some have
painted it,'' he told the AIA's annual forecast luncheon Wednesday.
   Aerospace employment has fallen almost 70,000 this year, to 1.25
million by year's end, and will decline by an additional l30,000
more in 1991, Fuqua said. He predicted that aerospace sales to the
Defense Department will dip to the lowest level since 1982, and
that 1991 will mark the fourth straight year of declining defense
business.
   ``It is clear that annual funding will fall considerably below
current levels,'' Fuqua said. ``It is not likely that the Middle
East situation will appreciably change plans for downsizing the
peacetime military establishment.''
   Fuqua, a former member of Congress, said there is a limit to how
much the United States can reduce its military force.
   ``It is now apparent to most people that the easing of East-West
tensions does not allow us to trade our swords for plowshares,'' he
said.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein may have done a major service to
U.S. security ``by reminding our nation that there is a lot of
potential for trouble from sources other than the Soviet Union,''
Fuqua said.
   The association, which represents most of the major companies in
the aerospace industry, said 1990 sales would total a record $131.4
billion, a 12 percent increase over the previous year.
   He also said:
   -New orders for aircraft and aerospace systems fell from $164
billion in 1989 to $136 billion in 1990, the first decline in total
new orders since 1981.
   -Exports set a record of $36.8 billion, and sales abroad lowered
the U.S. trade deficit by $26 billion.
   -Commercial transport aircraft sales were above $22 billion and
the backlog of orders was more than $100 billion as of Sept. 30.
   ``The industry's profit will rebound from a sharp drop in the
previous year to a billion-dollar gain in 1990 and a total profit
of $4.85 billion,'' Fuqua said. That's well below the average for
all U.S. manufacturing corporations.
   A major question beyond 1991, Fuqua said, is the health of the
world's airlines and their ability to finance the aircraft they
need to grow and to replace older aircraft.
   Fuel costs, soaring because of the gulf crisis, have not been
offset by fare increases and traffic growth is slowing.
   ``We must assume that the airlines' difficulties are for the
most part temporary and that they will be able to finance their
aircraft requirements,'' Fuqua said.

<HEAD>Europeans Meet Without Thatcher: Britain Will Be Easier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When European Community leaders meet this week,
the stubborn and blunt Margaret Thatcher will be absent for the
first time in 11 years, replaced by a mild-mannered man determined
to avoid confrontation.
   John Major, Britain's new Conservative prime minister, has
pledged to change the combative style but not the substance of
British policy.
   The two-day Rome summit, which begins on Friday, is set to
launch the community on Mrs. Thatcher's nightmare: a drive led by
France and Germany toward a Western Europe unified both politcally
and economically.
   ``We will not be deterred either from saying what we believe to
be wrong - or pressing what we believe to be right - by the cry
that we are insufficiently European,'' Major, 47, said after
succeeding Mrs. Thatcher two weeks ago.
   But already there are signs that Britain is toning down its
bitter opposition to plans for a single currency and for close
political ties that could turn the 12-nation community into a sort
of United States of Europe.
   In a key policy shift this week, Britain said the community
should have a formal role in security - an idea Mrs. Thatcher found
unacceptable, because it would exclude the United States.
   Mrs. Thatcher also vehemently rejected a single currency on
grounds that it is both impracticable and would diminish national
sovereignty. Major talks more carefully about resisting ``an
imposed single currency,'' which the 11 other community members
adopted at the last summit in late October in Rome.
   Mrs. Thatcher's furious denunciation of the idea precipitated
her downfall. Her deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, accused her of
endangering Britain's national interests and resigned, provoking a
leadership challenge.
   Major, the first British prime minister to grow up after World
War II, sounds more at ease than 65-year-old Mrs. Thatcher with the
idea of Britain closely wedded to a continent dominated by Germany.
   However, new political union proposals put forward last week by
France's President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl
of Germany appear as unacceptable to Major as they were to Mrs.
Thatcher.
   These include plans for the community to control health and
social services; widening the powers of the 518-member European
Parliament, now mainly a frum for discussion; and drastically
curtailing the right of veto by individual nations.
   Major's aides acknowledge his opposition, but appear determined
to avoid isolation. ``We see it as a welcome contribution,'' said
one senior British official of the French-German plan. ``We see no
particular reason why there should be any problem.''
   Pro-Europeans Britons are delighted, seeing this week's summit
as a new opportunity for Britain to get back into a Europe of
compromises and consensus.
   Still, Thatcher supporters in the deeply split Conservative
Party are deeply suspicious.
   ``We have to make up our minds whether we want to be a
self-governing nation or whether we want to be part of a United
States of Europe. ... You can't fudge this one,'' legislator Tony
Favell said in a television interview.
   Favell resigned in September as Major's main parliamentary aide
in protest after Mrs. Thatcher linked the pound sterling to the
other major community currencies.
   Whatever happens, Mrs. Thatcher, the Conservative veteran of
dozens of lone confrontations who the smaller nations often
secretly admired but seldom publicly backed, will be missed.
   ``They are not going to have the battles, and I tell you what
some of them have been thinking: they're going to have to make some
of the points I've been making, and it's not going to be nearly as
much fun,'' she said before stepping down.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
sharply higher Thursday while the dollar fell moderately against
the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 643.56 points to close
at 24,642.97 points. Volume was heavy at an estimated 600 million
shares.
   The dollar closed at 131.30 yen, down 0.58 yen from Wednesday's
close. The currency ranged between 131.10 yen and 131.38 yen after
opening at 131.30 yen.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds stood at 87.96 points, up from
Wednesday's close at 87.90 points. Their yield was unchanged at
7.070 percent.
   Currency dealers said the weakness of the dollar followed a
finish at 131.40 yen in New York overnight.
   ``With no strong market-affecting factors, the dollar is likely
to remain in the range of lower- to mid-131 yen,'' said a dealer
with Daiichi Kangyo Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Securities dealers said the bullish sentiment was strong on the
exchange because of eased tensions in the Gulf crisis.
   ``Active buying by both institutional and private investors is
likely to sustain the bullishness of the market for some time,''
said a dealer with Nikko Securities Co., speaking on condition of
anonymity.

   LONDON (AP) - Queen Elizabeth II entertained more than 800
guests at a glittering ball in Buckingham Palace honoring four
royal birthdays, including her mother's 90th.
   Guests at the Wednesday event the palace called ``the dance of
the decades'' included friends of the royal family from the arts,
politics and high society.
   The ball marked the 90th birthday of the Queen Mother on Aug. 4,
the 60th birthday of the queen's sister Princess Margaret on Aug.
21, the 40th birthday of the queen's daughter Princess Anne on Aug.
15, and the 30th birthday of the queen's second son, Prince Andrew,
on Feb. 19.
   The palace picture gallery with its valuable collection of Old
Master paintings was transformed into a ballroom to accommodate the
guests.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - After a starring role in the fiery film
``Havana,'' Lena Olin says she's warming up to working in America.
   The 35-year-old Swedish beauty is aware of her icy image, but
she said she appeared that way because she was afraid of being
swept up by Hollywood.
   ``Every time I leave for America ... (other Swedish actors) warn
me about being seduced by the money and the fame,'' she said. ``So
I got defensive and whenever I was interviewed, I kept quiet and
tried to keep my distance.''
   After spending a day at Disneyland with her 4-year-old son,
August, Olin said, ``With each trip here and with each new movie, I
feel more comfortable in America, and I'm starting to look forward
to the visits.''
   ``It was a lot easier when I just woke up each morning wanting
to get back to Sweden as soon as I could,'' she said. ``Now, I wake
up in Sweden and miss things here.''
   Olin starred in ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and was
nominated for an Oscar for her role in ``Enemies: A Love Story.''

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Playwright John Guare says the burden of
good theater rests not only with actors, directors and writers.
Audiences need to shoulder their share of the load, too.
   ``The audience should demand that the truth be told,'' Guare
said Wednesday at a convention of the American Council for the
Arts. ``Not the TV truth of diapers and cat food, which has to be
nice and likable or else you turn it off.''
   Theater buffs must demand the kind of truth that makes one say,
``I've been prepared for the great moments in my life - birth, love
and death. I've been there before because I've been prepared by
art,'' he said.
   Guare wrote the screenplay for ``Atlantic City,'' the
Tony-winning play ``The House of Blue Leaves'' and the play ``Six
Degrees of Separation,'' which is running in New York.
   Guare said theaters are failing to attract young audiences.
   He cited a Lincoln Center study 20 years ago that found the
average theatergoer was middle- and upper-class, college-educated
and 45 years old.
   A repeat of the study last year showed that theatergoers are
still college-educated, middle- and upper-class - and 65 years old,
he said.

<TEXT>
   A senior Pentagon official criticized last
week in an internal report for ignoring warnings about poor
mismanagement of the Navy's $50 billion stealth aircraft program
says he is resigning.
   John A. Betti, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, said
Wednesday he would leave effective Dec. 31. He said he was quitting
before Jan. 1 so he would not be covered by new ethics laws that
place tougher post-employment restrictions on government officials.
   Betti's resignation letter, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's
acceptance, did not mention the controversy over the Navy's A-12
Avenger, the radar-eluding plane being developed to replace
carrier-based A-6 fighter-bombers.
   Speaking privately, two Pentagon officials said Betti, a former
Ford Motor Co. official, had been thinking for some time about
returning to the private sector but that the timing of his decision
likely was affected by the A-12 controversy.
   One official said Cheney's plans to slash the responsibilities
of the job, which Betti has held 16 months, also was a factor.
   Betti's office referred calls to a Defense Department
spokeswoman, who said she had no information on whether Betti
already had lined up a new job. There was no immediate word on
candidates to replace him.
   In a report released last week, department Inspector General
Susan Crawford said Betti had been told by a deputy of significant
problems in the program but ``failed to report the conclusions'' to
Cheney and other senior Pentagon officials.
   Instead, ``Mr. Betti relied on general assurances, which he
invited, from the contractor and prior Navy assurances that the
A-12 development contract would be completed within ceiling
costs,'' Crawford's report said. ``We find Mr. Betti's failure
especially troubles in view of a prior warning ... of cost growth
on the A-12 program.''
   Cheney, in the wake of Crawford's report, ordered his top deputy
to recommend ``corrective actions'' including personnel changes if
necessary.
   Last week, the Navy dismissed its top three officials in the
program, including two admirals, for failing to disclose serious
flaws in the aircraft's development.
   The A-12 is the Navy's top aircraft priority as the service
moved to replace aging A-6s by the middle of the decade.
   Cheney told Congress in June that the program was on track. Just
three weeks later, the contractors, General Dynamics and McDonnell
Douglas, told the Navy they could not deliver the first plane on
time, that costs were escalating and that they could not meet some
performance standards.
   The program is now a year behind schedule and 20 percent over
the planned $4.7 billion cost.
   Crawford told Congress last week that the U.S. attorney in St.
Louis, where both McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics are based,
was conducting a criminal investigation of the program.
   In a written statement, Betti said he believed his tenure
included considerable progress in improving the Pentagon's
oft-criticized purchasing system. But he also said ``substantive,
lasting improvements in defense acquisition will not occur
overnight, rather it will be a long, slow and arduous process
requiring patience and constance of purpose.''
   The A-12 controversy was not the first time Betti has faced
criticism.
   In July, he rejected demands by angry lawmakers that he accept a
Justice Department recommendation that Northrop Corp. be barred
from Pentagon business for its criminal conviction on charges it
faked tests involving nuclear cruise missiles.
   At the same time, Betti acknowledged that he had not reviewed
evidence from several federal investigations of Northrop's conduct.
He also admitted he was unaware the military had repeatedly waived
contract requirements in the cruise missile program, even after
allegations of misconduct arose and a federal prosecutor warned
that such waivers could harm the government's case.

<HEAD>President Signs Order for Federal Pay Raises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is giving substantial pay
raises to thousands of federal employees in the New York, Los
Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas in a move drawing
protests from other expensive areas to live.
   ``Boston federal workers are getting a raw deal,'' said Rep.
Edward Markey, D-Mass., who initiated a letter signed by 10 House
members from Massachusetts to Bush.
   ``Civil servants in the Boston area face one of the highest
disparities between private and public sector pay in the nation,''
Markey said.
   The executive order signed by Bush on Wednesday provides for 8
percent extra pay raises for tens of thousands of civil servants in
the greater New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles metropolitan
areas because of the high cost of living there. The order also
raises the pay of his vice president, Cabinet, members of the
House, and top government executives by tens of thousands of
dollars apiece.
   House and Senate members from Massachusetts and Connecticut
protested that living expenses in their states are just as high and
that federal workers there should get the same raise.
   ``President Bush has expressed concern about recruiting and
retaining in the federal government the best and the brightest,''
said Constance Berry Newman, director of the Office of Personnel
Management, said after Bush signed the executive order. ``Now he's
delivered.''
   Bush's order provides a 4.1 percent across-the-board raise for
all federal workers. The 8 percent raise for those in the three
urban areas would come on top of the 4.1 percent hike. The extra
raise would benefit most of the 48,596 civilian federal employees
in the Los Angeles area and the 40,280 workers in the San Francisco
area, according to OPM statistics. The number of workers in the New
York region was not immediately available.
   Bush's own annual salary remains frozen at $200,000. But other
top officials got hefty pay raises.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, House Speaker Thomas Foley and Chief
Justice William Rehnquist all will be making $160,600 per year as
of Jan. 1 after getting an approximately 29 percent pay raise.
   Congress already has provided money for the pay raises. Bush's
order, which had been expected, was necessary to make it official.
   The 435 members of the House and several non-voting delegates
will all be making $125,100 next year, while the 100 senators will
be drawing $101,900.
   In addition to Rehnquist, all other members of the federal
judiciary are in for a raise. Associate justices of the Supreme
Court will receive $153,600; appeals court judges, $132,700;
district judges, court of international trade and claims court
judges, $125,100.
   The House voted itself a 25 percent increase in pay, plus a
cost-of-living adjustment, in exchange for forgoing speech
honoraria. The senators passed up the big pay raise but can still
draw speech fees, up to a maximum of about $27,500.
   House members earned $96,600 this year, while senators were paid
$98,400.
   Raising the lid on the lawmakers' pay also ratchets up the civil
service pay scales. Grade 18 civil servants, the top scale, will be
paid up to $97,317, compared to a current maximum of $78,200.
   The government's top executives will be paid from $101,300 to
$138,900.
   The pay scale for the 8,000-member Senior Executive Service will
start at $87,000 and top out at $108,300.
   The Senate majority and minority leaders, as well as the
president pro tempore of the Senate, will be paid $113,400.
   The House majority and minority leader will be paid $138,900.
   Retired federal workers and military retirees will get a 5.4
percent cost-of-living raise in January, the same size raise that
the nation's 33 million Social Security recipients are getting.

   Jack in the Box pulled its radio and TV ads in
Phoenix and is trying to keep a low profile after one of its cooks
was arrested on suspicion of blowing his nose into a hamburger he
served to a policeman.
   The man, George Juan Kuehme, 20, was fired after the incident
Monday.
   Jack in the Box corporate spokeswoman Jan McLane Rieger said
Wednesday that the fast-food chain withdrew its broadcast
commercials because of bad publicity, including ``jokes being made
on various radio stations.''
   She said the ads would not resume for two weeks in the area,
where there are 78 Jack in the Box franchises.
   Police said Kuehme, an employee for less than a week at a
Phoenix Jack in the Box, blew his nose onto one of the burgers two
police officers had ordered at the drive-up window.
   One officer, Gary Underhill, had taken three bites from his
sandwich when he noticed something wrong, police said.
   Kuehme is alleged to have told a co-worker, ``That's what the
cop gets.''
   He was booked on suspicion of aggravated assault, adding a
harmful substance to food and disorderly conduct.
   Mrs. Rieger said a second, unidentified employee was fired over
the incident. She said the company apologized to Underhill and
contributed $2,000 to a police fund.

<HEAD>No Progress in News Talks Despite Efforts of Top Federal Mediator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service says he may try again to spur negotiations
between the New York Daily News and its striking unions, despite a
day that brought no movement.
   ``I'm going to just wait a day or two and see what develops,''
Bernard E. DeLury said Wednesday.
   DeLury spent all day Wednesday shuttling between negotiators for
the Daily News and the unions, which had agreed to meet with him
but not with each other. Asked afterward whether there had been any
movement on the issues separating both sides, DeLury said: ``It's
been a moving day but, bottom line, no, they're still quite
separated in reaching an agreement.''
   The problem was the nine unions want to bargain as a group, and
the company wants to bargain with them individually, DeLury said.
   ``We've tried to mediate that particular issue all day,'' he
said.
   DeLury said the unions wanted to discuss their common issues,
namely, job security and permanent replacement workers.
   Theodore Kheel, a labor lawyer advising the unions, said the
company has hired 800 permanent replacement workers so far. Some
2,300 workers have been on strike since Oct. 25.
   One hopeful sign from Wednesday's session was that both sides
agreed to be recalled by DeLury. If he exercises that option,
DeLury said the next session would probably take place in New York.
   George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades
Council, said he was discouraged that company representatives
Robert Ballow and Ed Gold would not meet with the unions as a
group.
   ``I think that's outrageous,'' he said. ``It's another charade
on the part of the News and a pure sign they don't want to reach
any agreement.''
   Asked whether the situation had worsened, McDonald said, ``It
just hasn't changed.''
   The Daily News representatives declined to meet with reporters
after Wednesday's session.
   Members of the negotiation teams began arriving at the service's
headquarters shortly after 9 a.m. Union representatives entered by
the front door while management negotiators used a garage entrance.
   On Tuesday, a Senate subcommittee held a hearing on the strike
in New York and the paper's parent, the Tribune Co., held a board
meeting in Chicago.
   After the board meeting, Publisher James Hoge said the Daily
News would continue to publish as long as the tabloid showed
progress in regaining circulation and advertisers.
   There had been speculation that the board of directors would
decide to close the paper and cut the parent company's losses.
   Hoge said the Daily News' circulation had recently increased to
580,000. After the strike began, circulation dropped from 1.09
million.
   Hoge has said the newspaper has lost $115 million from 1979
through last year and that figure could reach $200 million by the
end of this year.
   He said the paper could become profitable if it reaches
``reasonable settlements'' with the striking unions.
   At the New York hearing, Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor said he
supported a proposed bill to block the hiring of permanent
replacement workers.
   O'Connor said he feared that ``if unions are broken or badly
bent'' in the Daily News strike it would be ``a severe blow to
unionism throughout the United States.''
   The hearing, before the Senate Labor subcommittee on labor and
human resources, was chaired by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   Metzenbaum has introduced legislation that would amend the
National Labor Relations Act to prohibit the hiring of permanent
replacements for striking workers. The legislation would not
prohibit the hiring of temporary replacements.

<HEAD>Boston Bank Attracts Treasury Deposits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A published report today says a troubled
Boston bank used Treasury tax deposits to bolster its financial
position.
   The New York Times reported that the Bank of New England appears
to have been able to reduce its borrowings from the Federal Reserve
from $2 billion to $14 million in April, after $1.8 billion in tax
payments flowed into the Treasury's account at the bank, the
newspaper said.
   Those tax payments were largely drawn back to the Treasury over
the next three months.
   Two Treasury spokeswomen said Wednesday night the bank had
received no special treatment that they were aware of.
   Borrowings from the Federal Reserve, available to any bank that
is a member of the Federal Reserve System, carry a stigma if a bank
relies on them. The Fed charges a premium interest rate if those
loans last more than 30 days.
   About 200 banks, including the Bank of New England, are used by
the Treasury to hold excess cash for a few days at a time, said
Lenora Cross, spokeswoman for the Office of Comptroller of the
Currency. This cash earns one-quarter point below a money market
interest rate, she said.
   ``These accounts are volatile,'' she said.
   When excess cash is put into these banks, it is done randomly,
according to the collateral the bank has deposited in advance at
the regional Federal Reserve Bank. A bank that wants more Treasury
deposits can get them automatically by putting up more collateral.
   A Treasury statement Wednesday night said: ``Treasury gave no
special treatment to the Bank of New England. All Treasury funds
... placed with banks are fully collateralized. Collateral is
valued at least as conservatively as the Fed values collateral''
for its loans to banks.
   The statement was read by an official who would not permit use
of her name. She and Ms. Cross said they did not know what
decisions the bank had made in recent months about depositing
collateral with the Federal reserve Bank of Boston, or why those
decisions were made.
   Bank of New England, which lost $1 billion last year as a result
of bad real estate loans, increased its Treasury accounts at the
end of the third quarter from $296 million last year to $975
million this year, the newspaper said.
   A bank vice president quoted by the newspaper, Arthur H. Meehan
Jr., does not have a listed telephone number.

   A young man accused of killing his infant
daughter admitted piling at least three blankets and a stack of
college textbooks on the 14-week-old child to keep her quiet while
he and his girlfriend had sex.
   Muhammed Bashar, 20, pleaded guilty to manslaughter Wednesday in
the 1989 suffocation of Jeanelle McCloskey. The death had
previously been attributed to sudden infant death syndrome.
   Bashar also pleaded guilty to beating in August a second
daughter born to girlfriend Wendy McCloskey. Four-month-old Lila
Slaughter suffered broken ribs, a broken leg and a broken ankle,
police said.
   Police said that that during the investigation of that child's
injuries, they became suspicious about what had happened to
Jeanelle 18 months earlier.
   Bashar could get up to 7{ to 15 years in prison at sentencing in
January.
   ``I had just come from college and me and Wendy was discussing
what I planned to accomplish and what my goals were when we began
to engage in a sexual act,'' he said. ``I placed several college
books and three blankets on her tail bone to keep her from annoying
us and disturbing us during the act.''
   When the couple realized the baby wasn't breathing, Bashar said,
he tried to revive her, then got on his knees to pray. He then
called 911.
   Police said the books weighed at least 11 pounds.
   Authorities said it was not known what role Bashar's 20-year-old
girlfriend played in the child's death.

<TEXT>
   Even the bus drivers have had it with
traffic in Bangkok, home of some of the world's worst gridlock.
   About 100 drivers a month - three a day - have been quitting in
recent months, fed up with frequent traffic jams that keep their
decrepit vehicles stalled on hot, polluted streets, officials said
today.
   Bangkok relies on buses as the only form of mass transport.
   The city has a shortage of about 500 bus drivers, with many
buses lying idle, Yangyong Koorovart, deputy director of the
Bangkok Mass Transit Authority, told reporters.
   The city hasn't been able to fill its quota of 9,200 drivers for
two to three years, but the recent increase in resignations has
made the problem critical, he said.
   The BMTA has a monopoly on mass transport in the city, operating
a fleet of 4,200 buses serving 4.5 million commuters daily.
   Yangyong said many dissatisfied drivers have used their
severance pay to join the tourism industry or buy motorcycles,
which are being used more often as taxis to get through stalled
traffic.
   The Thai government recently announced two major mass transport
plans for the capital, but they won't be in effect for several
years.

   Delta Air Lines is offering its traditional
winter specials earlier than usual because of slow business in the
travel industry.
   ``It looks like it's happened a little bit earlier now, which is
telling me bookings are a little bit softer than expected,''
Raymond E. Neidl, an airline analyst with Dillon Read &amp; Co., said

   Delta will award a free ticket to any frequent flier who
completes four round trips or two round trips with plane changes on
coach fares between Dec. 15 and March 15. The bonuses are
redeemable between May 15 and Dec. 31, 1991.
   The program also offers passengers first-class upgrades rather
than free trips.
   Airlines typically offer specials during the slow winter season,
but the overall ill health of the industry prompted Delta to begin
its promotion before the peak Christmas season ends, Delta

<HEAD>USDA Agrees To Make Loans Available</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers who lost crops this year to bad
weather can begin applying for low-interest loans, the Farmers Home
Administration announced after a week of lobbying by members of
Congress.
   FmHA spokesman Joe O'Neill said Wednesday that the agency would
begin accepting and processing loan applications immediately, but
that it would be at least two weeks before the loans could actually
be made.
   Congress this year, rather than approving a direct disaster aid
package for farmers who lost crops to bad weather, voted instead to
make $600 million available in low-interest emergency loans.
Congress also waived a federal prohibition against emergency
disaster loans to producers if crop insurance was available.
   Members of Congress say they have been waiting for Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter to issue regulations implementing the
waiver so farmers could apply for a loan.
   Asked if the FmHA was responding to congressional pressure,
O'Neill said the ``draft of the regulations had already been
written before we heard of additional (Capitol) Hill interest. Of
course we're trying to get them out as soon as possible since it
was in the farm bill.''
   But Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said last week that he had been
informed by members of Yeutter's staff that farmers would not
receive the benefit of the waiver for a month or more.
   Bentsen complained that farmers were in the process of making
financing arrangements for next year and that they and their
bankers ``are on a cycle of production that is dictated by nature,
not by federal regulations. ... They cannot wait another month, not
even for a Cabinet official.''

<HEAD>FEC Says Wright Failed To Disclose Use of S&amp;L Execs Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two fund-raising committees for former House
Speaker Jim Wright have acknowledged that they accepted an illegal
contribution from a Texas businessman implicated in the savings and
loan scandal, according to the Federal Election Commission.
   FEC spokesman Scott Moxley said Wednesday that Wright's
principal fund-raising committee and his leadership political
action committee have agreed to pay penalties totaling $1,500 to
settle the case.
   Wright, a Fort Worth Democrat who was House majority leader at
the time, was on his way to Haiti Wednesday and could not be
reached for comment, a spokesman said.
   At issue was Wright's use of a chartered airplane that
crisscrossed Texas between June 30 and July 2, 1985, to promote a
``Cowtown Jamboree'' in Fort Worth. The fund-raiser sought to raise
$1 million for Wright's principal campaign committee, the Wright
Appreciation Committee, and his leadership PAC, the Majority
Congress Committee.
   Under the conciliation agreement, the two committees
acknowledged they accepted an illegal contribution from the owner
of the plane, Kenneth C. Hood, and that they failed to disclose the
receipt of the contribution. The committees also acknowledged a
violation stemming from the way they repaid Hood for the use of the
plane 46 months later, Moxley said.
   Wright repaid Hood $8,050 for the use of the plane in April
1989, in the midst of a House ethics committee investigation that
led to his resignation a month later. At the time, Wright said the
failure to pay the bill was an ``oversight.''

<HEAD>Old Christmas Trees Being Used to Save Louisiana Wetlands</HEAD>

   Dried-out Christmas trees that used to go
into the trash are going into Louisiana wetlands by the thousands
to save miles of ecologically sensitive land that is eaten away by
erosion each year.
   Last year, scientists placed 12,000 old Christmas trees along
the Lake Pontchartrain shoreline in St. Charles Parish.
   The project worked so well that it is being expanded across the
state, and 16 of Louisiana's 19 coastal parishes have agreed to
institute tree recycling programs, said Bill Good of the state
Department of Natural Resources.
   Around the country, recycling projects have sprung up involving
trees that normally are kept in the home for a couple of weeks
before being tossed into the nation's rapidly filling landfills.
   In Vermont, Indiana and Illinois, thousands of old Christmas
trees have been ground up in recent years and used as fertilizer
for parks, gardens and lawns.
   On Lake Pontchartrain, environmentalist Milton Cambre said the
old trees put there last year have begun to collect sediment and
spur the growth of vegetation, which in turn will act as a buffer
between the lake's waves and the wetland soil.
   Louisiana loses 35 to 40 square miles of wetlands a year. It has
40 percent of the nation's wetlands and 80 percent of the wetlands'
loss.
   Scientists say the project also reduces sediment in lakes,
improving water clarity and promoting aquatic vegetation, which in
turn attracts wildlife.
   Parishes in the tree recycling project are each receiving
$10,000 from the state Wetlands Conservation and Restoration Fund.
   In Jefferson Parish, plans are to collect 13,000 trees this year
for use at 44 sites. St. Tammany Parish hopes to collect 4,000
trees for use at one site.
   Rod Emmer of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana said the
programs give people a way to do their part to preserve the
environment.
   ``Even if you just put your Christmas tree out by the street
(for pickup), you've done something,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ecologists Attack Government's Environmental Plan, Business
Welcomes It</HEAD>

   Ecologists and the leftist opposition are
ridiculing the Conservative government's ``Green Plan'' for
protecting the environment as muddled ``eco-babble'' that lacks
both teeth and funding.
   Mining and manufacturing industries were generally pleased with
the program, which was announced with fanfare Wednesday by
Environment Minister Robert de Cotret.
   ``From our point of view, it's a fairly good document,'' said
Paul Summers of the Canadian Manufacturing Association.
   ``We were concerned there would be some sort of carbon tax or
environment tax in general,'' said George Miller, president of the
Mining Association of Canada. ``It was good they deferred those
things until they could study them more carefully.''
   The plan pledges $3 billion through 1996 to clean up and protect
Canada's air, water, forests, soil, wildlife and fisheries. But, as
critics quickly pointed out, not a cent of spending has been
approved by the Cabinet.
   ``It wasn't green and it wasn't a plan,'' said Dan McDermott of
Greenpeace, the environmental organization. ``As Kai Millyard (of
Friends of the Earth) said, it would have been a revolutionary
document if it had been released in 1975. It has no clear goal, no
clear vision.
   ``There were whole sections of it where issues were dealt with
in an extremely cursory fashion or else tangled in
incomprehensibility.''
   Canada, with an area of 6,195,192 square miles and fewer than 27
million people, has a great interest in keeping its vast forests,
lakes and Arctic region free of pollution.
   As with most nations, and with a little help from its southern
neighbor, Canada is beset with acid rain, dying lakes, dwindling
forests and mountains of garbage and industrial waste. It must deal
with the struggle between environment and economic development -
the need for more electric power, minerals, paper, wood against the
need to preserve the ecology.
   As one columnist put it, de Cotret's plan is like a bottle of
champagne that has been open for a while. ``The bottle looks
impressive from the outside, and there's something sweet about the
contents. But there's no fizz or pop...''
   The 173-page document lays out eight areas for funding.
   -$850 million for reducing pollution-related health problems.
   -$575 million for stabilizing gas emissions.
   -$500 million to aid native and environmental groups.
   -$350 million for forests and farmland.
   -$275 million for federal operations.
   -$175 million to set aside 12 percent of Canada as protected
space.
   -$175 million for emergency preparedness.
   -$100 million for protection of northern ecosystems.
   Liberal opposition leader Herb Gray said the plan was just ``an
empty shell'' because ``not one nickel of that money has been
approved by Cabinet for specific projects listed in the Green
Plan.''
   The Toronto Star said the government of Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney missed a golden opportunity to increase its sagging
popularity, now at a mere 14 percent in the polls.
   ``The government's Green Plan is not just a disappointing
collection of vague promises and recycled plans, it is a testament
to Ottawa's failure to capitalize on the one issue that unites
Canadians: Their desire to protect the environment,'' the newspaper
said in a commentary.
   More than one critic noted the plan was long on verbs like
``monitor,'' ``study,'' ``assess,'' and ``analyze,'' and short on
verbs like ``implement,'' ``begin,'' and ``establish.''
   ``This government is not going to take on the fossil fuel
industry,'' said McDermott. ``You can't deal with carbon dioxide
and global warming unless you cut down and phase out fossil fuels.
They are looking to cap CO2 emissions, not cutting them back.''
   Polls show Canadians are serious about preserving their
environment and are prepared to pay for it through higher taxes and
prices.
   ``But the industries ... don't want to hear about changing their
ways,'' said McDermott.
   For environmentalists, tomorrow will be no different than
yesterday.
   ``None of the agenda items has changed,'' said McDermott. ``All
the Green Plan has done is highlight how bad the situation is.''

<HEAD>Fish Are Biting; All Persian Gulf Soldiers Need Are Some Fishing

   Fishing poles will soon be on their way
to U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia.
   Fishing poles? In the desert?
   It seems that members of the Air Force's 317th Tactical Airlift
Wing are stationed on an island off Saudi Arabia - literally a
desert island - and they've been making like Robinson Crusoe, using
makeshift equipment to reel in fish in their free time.
   But a Christmas package will soon be on the way - filled with
rods, reels, tackle and lures - courtesy of the Shakespeare
Products Group in Columbia. Marketing director Tim Fraylick put the
package together after receiving a letter from Sgt. Jeffrey T.
Robbins.
   ``There's not much to do here in our free time, but we found out
that there's prime fishing wading offshore,'' Robbins wrote.
Lacking rods, the unit used sharpened aircraft hinge pins as hooks
and rope for line, he said.
   ``We're running low on both and are asking foryyour help,''
Robbins wrote. Getting some fishing poles would ``definitely be a
booster shot in the arm for all of us here.''
   Robbins' unit, from Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina, was
dispatched to the Persian Gulf after the invasion of Kuwait.
   ``This letter came out of the blue. I didn't think anybody would
fish over there,'' said Fraylick. ``People are asking me, `Why are
you sending rods to the desert? You can't fish in the desert.'''
   Fraylick is sending eight rods, reels and some line. Various
manufacturers are donating about 70 lures. He added he isn't sure
what fishing conditions off Saudi Arabia are like. But he's sending
medium-weight salt-water equipment.
   ``I'm relating the conditions to those in the Gulf of Mexico,''
he said.

<HEAD>Town's Christmas Gift to Residents: Free Electricity for Holiday
Lights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALTAMONT, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Decorate your house with more than a
strand of holiday lights in this city and your electric bill will
read: $0.00.
   For the fourth consecutive December, Altamont is paying 90
percent of its residents' electric bills. And the city will throw
in the remaining 10 percent for anyone who enters its annual
holiday lighting contest.
   ``Anybody who hears about it is amazed,'' said Helen Moll, city
clerk for the farming community of 2,400. ``They don't know how we
can manage it.''
   The free electricity became available in 1987. Altamont, a
member of a power distribution cooperative with several other
cities, had wanted to drop out because it had found a cheaper
supplier. To keep the cooperative together, the other cities agreed
to pay Altamont the $7,000 a year the city would have saved.
   The money is used to cover the cost of residents' December
lighting bills.
   ``It was an easy way to give a little back to the community when
the Christmas bills came due and to help decorate the city at the
same time,'' said Donald Wendling, the city's electrical services
commissioner.
   It has also revived a threatened Yuletide ritual.
   ``We're a small German community with a tradition of Christmas,
and it has been a tradition here for years to decorate,'' Wendling
said. ``But when the energy crisis hit in the '70s it kind of died
off.''
   The rebates from the cooperative end after next year, however,
and Wendling said he doesn't know if the discounts will continue
past 1991.
   In the meantime almost everyone in town is lighting up the
house. Last year, Moll said, 600 of the city's 800 residential
customers entered the contest and got the full December discount,
which averaged $55 to $65.
   Anyone who puts up more than a string of holiday lights is
eligible.
   Moll said the decorations have made an impression on
out-of-towners, recalling the words of a visitor from Chicago: ``He
told us we had the prettiest town he ever saw.''

<HEAD>Feds: Gotti Was Near Scene of Mob Hit That Put Him in Power</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors have gone 0-for-3 against reputed
Mafia boss John Gotti since 1986 but say they have a charge this
time that is likely to stick: ordering the 1985 hit that lifted the
Dapper Don to power.
   The case against him includes ``crystal clear'' audio tapes and
a witness who claims Gotti boasted about planning the rubout of his
reputed predecessor as boss of the Gambino family, ``Big Paul''
Castellano, authorities said.
   ``This is our best effort so far,'' said James M. Fox, head of
the FBI's New York office.
   Gotti, 50, was accused in a racketeering indictment Wednesday of
ordering four murders, including Castellano's, and conspiring to
kill a fifth person. He was also accused of gambling, loansharking,
obstruction and tax evasion.
   He pleaded innocent with three alleged associates and was
returned to jail, where he was held since his arrest Tuesday. U.S.
District Judge I. Leo Glasser did not grant bail for Gotti and two
others and set a hearing for Monday.
   Gotti has been indicted three times in recent years on state and
federal charges and beat the rap each time, earning the nickname
``The Teflon Don.''
   His lawyer, Bruce Cutler, denounced the indictment as a vendetta
by publicity-hungry authorities, and denied Gotti is involved in
organized crime.
   ``This is our fourth indictment in five years,'' Cutler said in
arguing for his release on bail. ``Your honor, they can't convict
him. He shouldn't be doing life on the installment plan.''
   The reputed mobster, a swaggering, barrel-chested known for his
custom-made, double-breasted suits, maintains he's a salesman for a
plumbing company and a company that sells zippers and hangers to
the fashion industry.
   ``His real job is boss of the most powerful crime family in this
country,'' said U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney. ``He's a murderer,
he's not a folk hero.''
   The indictment was the first official attempt to prove Gotti was
near the scene when Castellano was shot to death outside a
steakhouse in December 1985.
   ``It is fair to say we have a witness who places him near the
site,'' Maloney said, declining to say how close Gotti allegedly
was.
   Prosecutors and FBI officials speaking on the condition they not
be identified told The New York Times the witness was a passerby,
not an informer.
   Some of the previous failures to convict Gotti have been blamed
on murky audio tapes, but Fox said that won't be a problem this
time, describing them as ``crystal clear.'' ``Gotti won't be
pleased when he hears them,'' Fox said.
   Also arrested were Frank ``Frankie Loc'' Locascio, 58, Salvatore
``Sammy Bull'' Gravano, 45, and Thomas Gambino, 61. Gambino is the
son of the late Carlo Gambino, the patriach of the crime family
that bears his name.
   ``To my knowledge, this is the first time that we have taken
down the entire hierarchy of an organized-crime family - the boss,
the underboss, the consigliere,'' Fox said of Gotti, Locascio and
Gravano, respectively.
   Prosecutors said they would play tapes at Monday's bail hearing
to support their contention that Gotti, Locascio and Gravano are a
threat to witnesses in the case if set free.
   A top witness expected to testify in the case is Phillip ``Crazy
Phil'' Leonetti, a former Mafia underboss of Philadelphia's Scarfo
family, who told investigators Gotti bragged about planning the
Castellano slaying.
   Investigators say Gotti had his former boss killed because of
Castellano's prohibition, punishable by death, on Gambino family
involvement in narcotics.

<TEXT>
   The Security Council has once again
postponed a vote on a resolution endorsing a Middle East peace
conference, this time at the request of the Soviet Union.
   Deputy Soviet ambassador, Valentin Lozinskiy, sought the
five-day delay so Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze can
first confer with PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, diplomats said.
   Shevardnadze, who was in Washington on Wednesday meeting
separately with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and President
Bush, will meet Arafat on Friday in Ankara, Turkey, said the
diplomats, who spoke privately.
   Diplomats said Shevardnadze would seek to pressure Arafat to
distance the PLO from Iraq, which has been championing the
Palestinian homeland issue since invading Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has sought to link the issue to a
settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The United States has thus been struggling to remove from the
proposed resolution any language endorsing a Middle East peace
conference, fearing it would look like a concession to Iraq.
   The United States is in a diplomatic bind.
   Israel, which the United States has traditionally supported,
opposes any call for a conference. But a U.S. veto of such a
conference-endorsing resolution could jeopardize the U.S. relations
with Arab members of the coalition arrayed against Iraq.
   The delay on a vote until Monday will give the United States and
the non-aligned nations on the Security Council more time to try to
work out a compromise.
   The United States circulated a draft resolution on Wednesday in
which the paragraph endorsing the conference was taken out and put
in a separate, non-binding statement.
   But non-aligned nations on the council rejected the U.S. draft.
   The Yemeni ambassador, a co-sponsor of the resolution, said,
``That has been a suggestion, but we have not moved an inch.''
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering seemed to despair when asked if
it was possible to pass any resolution: ``I don't know, I have
hopes that we can. We have been seeking for a long time a mutually
agreeable text, in good faith.''
   The situation became more complicated Wednesday when France
announced it could not support any resolution that did not contain
the call for a peace conference. France did not indicate whether it
would cast a veto, however.
   A vote on the resolution has been put off six times in a week.
On Wednesday, nine of the Security Council's 15 members, including
the United States, voted to postpone; four voted against, and
France and China abstained.
   The Israelis are adamantly opposed to the peace conference
proposal.
   They say they will not accept any imposed settlement, and fear a
peace conference would force them into a ``land-for-peace'' deal
with their Arab neighbors. They say they want bilateral talks with
their Arab adversaries.
   Saddam says he will withdraw from Kuwait only in the context of
a comprehensive Middle East peace conference that would address all
problems in the region.

   Some viewers complain there's too much trash
on television. Channel 59 in suburban Pittsburgh has garbage 24
hours a day.
   It's the parking lot channel, a flickering television image
recorded by a security camera outside the Adelphia Cable TV Co.
   The building's garbage bin appears to serve as host of the live
show around the clock. Regular guests include garbage collectors
and rows of parked cars.
   Channel 59, available only to an estimated 5,700 Adelphia
subscribers in Bethel Park, was created about six weeks ago after a
thief took cable gear from trucks parked in the lot, Adelphia
operations manager Chuck Redpath said Wednesday.
   Employees conceived the idea of televising live from the parking
lot, hoping robbers would stay away if they knew a camera was
watching. Company managers also figured that if the thieves
returned, police might see them on the new channel.
   Adelphia Cable set up lights to improve the quality of the
picture and installed a cheap black-and-white camera, then wired
the camera to the unused channel.
   Bethel Park police, though, said they don't tune in.
   Watching the parking lot channel is ``like watching that thing
that sells jewelry or whatever,'' said Detective Ron Evans,
referring to a shopping network.
   Forty-eight other channels with wider appeal reach about 32,000
Adelphia subscribers in western Pennsylvania. The company's Channel
56, for example, Mind Extension University, offers telecourses for
college credit.
   Then there's public access Channel 7, featuring ``Big Brush
Painting'' with one of Adelphia's quality-control inspectors, Chuck
Strink.
   There's no charge for Channel 59. And so far, it's a small
matter if nobody watches. The unblinking lens of Channel 59 seems
to be doing the job.
   ``As a matter of fact, since we started it we've had no problems
whatsoever,'' Redpath said.

   Scientists today reported some of the strongest
evidence yet that red meat significantly raises the risk of colon
cancer.
   The research found that people who eat beef, pork or lamb every
day are more than twice as likely to get colon cancer as those who
avoid red meat. Even those who have meat occasionally raise their
risk somewhat, the study said.
   The findings, published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine, came as no surprise to health experts who have been
urging reduced red meat consumption for years because of its links
to heart disease and cancer, but the new study solidifies beliefs
about its cancer effects.
   ``Moderate red meat intake is certainly better than large
amounts, but it's quite possible that no red meat intake is even
better,'' said Dr. Walter C. Willett, who directed the study at
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
   Another non-surprise in the study of 88,751 nurses from 1980 to
1986 was the finding that switching to fish and chicken helped
reduce the risk of colon cancer.
   ``That has practical implications, because it will be easier for
people to increase chicken and fish consumption rather than
becoming strict vegetarians,'' Willett said.
   Colon cancer is the second-leading cancer killer after lung
cancer. An estimated 110,000 new cases will be diagnosed in the
United States this year.
   In the study, 150 of the women studied got colon cancer.
Although all the participants were women, the researchers said
their conclusions probably apply to men, too.
   The study ``provides some of the most direct evidence that there
is likely to be a payoff in cancer risk by reducing our consumption
of animal fat,'' Willett said.
   The eating recommendations of major health organizations already
emphasize cutting down on red meat and other sources of saturated
fat.
   Dr. Peter Greenwald of the National Cancer Institute cautioned
against interpreting the report to mean people should stop eating
red meat entirely.
   ``Meat has important nutrient value.'' he said. ``The message
should be to cut down, not to cut out.''
   Dr. David Hurt, a nutritionist with the National Livestock and
Meat Board in Chicago, said the study is outdated. Beef is 27
percent leaner and pork is 31 percent leaner than in 1986, when the
nurses' data were gathered, he said.
   ``I don't see how these numbers can relate to today's
situation,'' he said of the study. ``Meat today is not the same as
it was then.''
   Among the Boston researchers' findings:
   -Women who ate beef, pork or lamb as a main dish every day were
2{ times more likely to get colon cancer than were those who ate it
less than once a month.
   -For those who consumed meat less frequently, the risk was
lower. For instance, women who ate meat between once a month and
once a week had about 40 percent higher risk than the abstainers.
The risk was about 50 percent higher for those who ate meat two to
four times a week and 80 percent higher for those who had it five
or six times.
   -Processed meats and liver also were linked to increased colon
cancer risk.
   -Women who ate skinless chicken every day had only about half as
much risk as those who almost never ate chicken.
   -Low consumption of fiber, which many health experts believe may
contribute to colon cancer, was not linked with the disease in this
study. None of the participants were high fiber consumers, so no
strong conclusions in this area could be drawn, Willet said.
   -Diets high in vegetable fats were not linked with cancer
either. Neither were whole milk, cheese and ice cream, which are
other sources of animal fat.
   Until now, most of the evidence implicating red meat in colon
cancer came from comparisons of people living in different parts of
the world. In Western countries, where meat is plentiul, the
disease is up to 10 times more common than in many nations in the
Far East and developing world.

   The dollar fell against major foreign currencies
today in early European trading. Gold prices were higher.
   Traders said the dollar could fall further today after the
release of U.S. retail sales figures for November.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the figures are expected to show a
further weakening in consumer demand in the United States and fuel
speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease interest rates soon.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.58 yen to a closing 131.30 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 131.42 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   -1.4760 German marks, down from 1.4788
   -1.2615 Swiss francs, down from 1.2650
   -5.0130 French francs, down from 5.0240
   -1.6665 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6675
   -1,112.50 Italian lire, down from 1,113.25
   -1.1600 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1599
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9500, up from
$1.9435 late Wednesday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$373.00 per ounce at midmorning, up from $371.75 bid per ounce late
Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $372.50, up from $371.60 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 86 cents to close at a bid
$373.48.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.04 a troy ounce,
from Wednesday's $4.03.

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Plan To Defuse Slovakia's Separatist Movement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Parliament has approved a new
division of powers between the federal government and the country's
two regional republics, settling a lingering crisis and saving
national unity.
   Deputies on Wednesday voted 237 to 24 in favor of a
constitutional amendment handing broad economic powers to the Czech
and Slovak republics.
   The federal government retains jurisdiction over defense,
foreign policy, economic and fiscal strategy.
   The decision was a compromise reached after Slovak leaders
threatened to proclaim the sovereignty of Slovak law over federal
legislation if their demands for economic control were not met.
   Slovakia, the country's eastern and more rural third, spent
centuries under Hungarian domination.
   Many Slovaks feel they exchanged Hungarian rule for Czech
domination when the two nations, who speak very similar languages,
united in 1918.
   Nationalism and separatism have grown steadily in Slovakia since
Communist rule crumbled last year.
   After a heated two-day debate, deputies decided to exclude the
controversial issue of ownership of oil pipelines from the
constitutional amendment passed Wednesday, leaving the decision to
parliamentary jurisdiction.
   Slovak leaders have demanded that two separate shareholding
companies be appointed to oversee the vital pipeline that connects
Czechoslovakia with its sole supplier of oil, the Soviet Union.
   Czechs are suspicious that this would give Slovaks vital control
of energy resources flowing to the western Czech lands.
   Late Tuesday, the Czech and Slovak regional parliaments reached
an agreement to set up a single transnational company overseeing
the pipeline.
   The federal Parliament retained the right to interfere in energy
distribution in times of emergency, the state news agency CTK
reported.
   The federation also retains the right to decide on nationality
issues.
   Following weeks of demonstrations in November, the Slovak
government passed legislation allowing the 600,000 ethnic
Hungarians in Slovakia the use their language in areas where they
represent more than 20 percent of the population.
   Settling another controversy, the federal Parliament also
honored a demand from the Slovaks that the governorship of the
Central Bank rotate annually between Czechs and Slovaks.
   Parliament's two-day debate opened Monday with an unprecedented
speech by President Vaclav Havel, who asked the legislature to
grant him broader powers to defuse constitutional crises.
   Although Havel did not spell out what his demands were, Vice
Premier Pavel Rychetsky said they might include veto power over the
Parliament's decisions.
   The request by the Czech president met with strong Slovak
opposition Wednesday and may face tough debate in the Parliament
when it is submitted for discussion next week.
   Havel also urged that a constitutional court be set up and
referenda allowed to settle future constitutional disputes.
   Although Havel's request for extra powers is unpopular with the
Slovaks, his forceful intervention apparently spurred Parliament to
solve the crisis that has threatened to tear Czechoslovakia apart
in recent months.
   Havel is currently on a four-day official visit to Spain and
Portugal and returns to Prague on Friday.

<HEAD>Major San Francisco Quakes May Be Predictable From Smaller Ones,
Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three biggest earthquakes of the past 150
years near San Francisco Bay were preceded by unusually frequent
moderate quakes, suggesting a possible means of prediction,
scientists reported today.
   In each case, the moderate shocks occurred over several years on
faults near the one that finally produced the major quake,
scientists said.
   If the pattern proves predictive, scientists may be able to give
a percentage risk of a major Bay Area earthquake occuring within a
span of a few years to a decade, study co-author Lynn Sykes said in
a recent interview.
   That would be more precise than the 30-year interval now
frequently used, he said.
   Sykes is a professor of geological sciences at Columbia
University in New York and a researcher at Columbia's
Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory. He and colleague Steven
Jaume present their observations in today's issue of the British
journal Nature.
   ``The idea is certainly not new by any means,'' but the study's
method is a different way of showing a previously recognized
pattern, commented Bruce Bolt, professor of seismology at the
University of California at Berkeley.
   The Columbia scientists measured prior seismic activity near the
major quakes by recording seismic moment, which is essentially the
strength of low-frequency seismic waves given off by earthquakes.
   The researchers added up the cumulative seismic moment from
quakes measuring at least 5 on the Richter scale, over 35 years
preceding each of three major quakes.
   Analysis showed that this total rose sharply in the 11 years
before the major quake of 1989, in the nine years before a large
quake in 1906, and in the four years preceding a major quake in
1868. The four-year interval is probably too small because too
little data were available, the researchers wrote.

<HEAD>U.S. Pulls Non-essential Staff And Dependents From Violence-Wracked
Somalia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is evacuating all U.S.
dependents and non-essential staff from Somalia due to a rise in
factional fighting, armed robberies and shootings that have claimed
at least 30 lives in the capital.
   Washington ordered the evacuation Wednesday.
   They will reduce staff at the U.S. mission in Mogadishu to
minimal levels, including the ambassador and a few other senior
personnel. The order did not say how many people would be flown
home.
   The evacuation comes on the heels of a U.S. weekend advisory
urging Americans to leave Somalia and warning travelers against
visiting the Horn of Africa nation.
   One of several rebel groups seeking President Mohamed Siad
Barre's overthrow, the Somali National Congress, is reportedly
within 30 miles of the capital.
   ``Violent incidents have continued in Mogadishu since the week
of Dec. 2, including factional fighting, armed robbery and
shootings,'' said Wednesday's order.
   The State Department said at least 30 people had been killed in
the recent upsurge of violence, but it noted that some reports had
put the death toll at more than 50.
   No Americans have been injured, however a Somali working as a
driver for the U.S. Embassy was shot and wounded Dec. 3 when he
drove into a neighborhood where fighting was going on, according to
the State Department.
   In a letter written Tuesday and smuggled out of Mogadishu by a
traveler, a Somali government official told an Associated Press
reporter who visited the country two months ago that conditions
have ``very much deteriorated.''
   ``A day hardly passes without scores of people being killed
either by Red Berets (the presidential guard) or rival gangs who
roam the city,'' wrote the official, who asked not to be
identified.
   ``Barre's days are numbered. We live in a state of terror.''
   The official cited shortages of food and drinking water in
Mogadishu.
   The $35 million U.S. Embassy, completed last year, is the
largest American diplomatic compound in sub-Saharan Africa. It has
three swimming pools and a nine-hole golf course.
   Its staff of 450 was slashed in half by the end of 1989,
reflecting sharp reductions in U.S. aid to the disintegrating
nation and the number of people needed to administer it.
   Staff reductions continued this year and as of this week there
were 66 U.S. government employees in Mogadishu.
   About 200 private American citizens also live in Somalia,
including a large number of dual Somali-U.S. nationals, according
to the statement prepared by the State Department in Washington.
   Since June, more than half a dozen unexplained bombings have
occurred at diplomatic missions and government offices in Mogadishu
and at least three foreigners have been killed in robberies,
holdups and car thefts.
   In July, security forces opened fire on a crowd that jeered
President Barre in a soccer stadium, killing at least 60 people,
say diplomats. The next month, the Red Beret hijacked at least
three dozen 4-wheel drive vehicles at gunpoint from Western
organizations.
   Human rights groups have accused troops of killing thousands of
civilians suspected of supporting the rebels. The fighting also has
caused an estimated 400,000 refugees to flee into neighboring
Ethiopia.
   Barre, believed to be in his 80s, has ruled the desert nation
since seizing power in a bloodless 1969 coup.

<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein issued an
amnesty today for Iraqis who fled the country during its 1980-88
war with Iran, government-run newspapers reported.
   Diplomats in Baghdad said the decree apparently was aimed at
facilitating the return of thousands of Iraqi servicemen who are in
Iran and want to return but fear reprisal for desertion and siding
with the enemy during the war.
   The newspapers said the pardon will include army deserters and
activists wanted for political crimes committed in Iraq before
their flight.
   Iraq considers membership of opposition parties and unauthorized
groups as political crimes.
   A decree by the ruling Revolution Command Council and signed by
Saddam said those who want to benefit from the pardon should return
to Iraq within two months, but students abroad can stay until they
finish their studies.
   Western diplomats say as many as 100,000 Iraqis deserted the
army during the Iran-Iraq war. Many fled to neighboring countries,
including Iran.
   There was no way to determine what the response might be. The
penalty for desertion in Iraq is execution, and thousands of the
Iran-Iraq war deserters were shot after capture, often in front of
their families or military units.
   Earlier blanket amnesties for Kurdish rebels and other political
dissidents have not attracted many of Saddam's opponents back to
Iraq.

   Tons of badly needed imported food are languishing
in Soviet ports, KGB officials reported today as they cracked down
on profiteering that they say is contributing to the national food
shortage.
   Food stuck in warehouses and ships can be easy prey for corrupt
workers, who can sell to the speculators who capitalize on
shortages in government-run stores, Maj. Gen. Alexander N.
Karbainov told a news conference at KGB headquarters.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has ordered the KGB and the
Interior Ministry to combat profiteering after serious shortages
hit Moscow, Leningrad and other large cities.
   The shortages also are blamed on an inefficient distribution
system.
   Karbainov stressed that as far as the KGB can tell, all food
donated by the West has reached those who need it without falling
into the hands of profiteers.
   But the situation appeared quite different for food and other
goods imported through normal channels. According to figures
released by Karbainov and his aides, 1.6 million tons of imported
goods await unloading or shipment from ports, including 11,000 tons
of food.
   The situation is much the same for foreign and domestically
produced food shipped by rail, KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov said
in an interview published today in the Communist Party daily
Pravda.
   ``Thousands of railway containers laden with important goods,
commodities and machinery are standing idle and unloaded. ... this
includes freight coming from abroad,'' he said.
   ``In certain areas, whole trains are being simply abandoned on
side tracks. In the Irkutsk area (of Siberia), the number of such
abandoned trains now stands at 52,'' he said.
   While food is scarce in big Russian cities, it is much more
plentiful in farmers' markets throughout the country. Food supplies
are much the same as last year in the countryside and most of the
14 non-Russian republics, according to officials and media reports.
   Karbainov, in his news conference, sought to temper a speech
that Kryuchkov made Tuesday night. Kryuchkov said unidentified
foreign powers were giving moral and material support to Soviet
radicals, who were in turn exacerbating and taking advantage of
food shortages for their own political ends.
   The nationally televised speech struck a jarring note, in light
of the tons of food being sent to the Soviet Union by countries
concerned that the food shortage could spark tumult that would
jeopardize Gorbachev's reforms.
   Asked whether evidence had been found that any foreign country
had contributed to the food shortage, Karbainov replied, ``as to
the economic aspects, there are no such facts.''
   But he said that ``there are regions in the country where
destructive forces are at work ... and these people make the
maximum use of shortages for political ends.''
   Asked exactly which political forces were exploiting the food
shortages, he said ``this will take time'' to determine.''

   President Bush fired Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos because he did not make enough progress in education, an
area the president named as a high priority for his administration,
White House sources say.
   Chief of Staff John H. Sununu personally informed Cavazos of the
firing a day before the secretary's departure was announced
Wednesday, said one of the sources, an administration official who
insisted on anonymity. An education official with ties to the White
House said Cavazos had been given until the end of the month to
quit.
   Several possible successors have been suggested, with Lynne
Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities,
singled out as the frontrunner. The National Conservative
Foundation already has sent Bush a letter recommending Cheney.
   Deputy Education Secretary Ted Sanders is serving as acting
secretary, and sources said he has been lobbying for the
nomination.
   In his two years as education secretary, Cavazos was best known
for promoting the idea of allowing parents to decide which school -
public or private - their children will attend with public
financing.
   The first Hispanic-American to head a Cabinet department, he
also advocated bilingual education, curbing school dropouts and
improving adult literacy.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said Cavazos' ``commitment to
educational opportunities for minorities and the poor has been
without question.''
   But one of the White House officials, speaking only on condition
of anonymity, said Cavazos was seen as lacking dynamism and not
making enough progress in education, an area Bush designated as a
high priority.
   Cavazos was out of town Wednesday and let it be known he would
not be back, not even for the kind of personal departure appearance
that Bush made with other top officials who have left his
administration, an official said.
   However, the secretary was expected to keep a scheduled
appearance Saturday in West Virginia.
   The resignation, announced at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, is
effective Saturday.
   Cavazos, 63, the fourth person to serve as secretary of
education, gave neither a reason for his resignation nor details
about his future plans, said Education Department spokeswoman Etta
Fielek.
   Many education officials, even his harshest critics, said it was
apparent Cavazos received little support from the White House.
   ``The administration Secretary Cavazos served did not match his
convictions with deeds that would have carried out the commitments
implicit in President Bush's desire to be an education president,''
said Robert H. Atwell, president of the American Council on
Education.
   ``In that sense, the administration was better served by
Secretary Cavazos than he was by those in the White House,'' Atwell
said.
   Richard F. Rosser, president of the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities, said, ``Any crticisms there
may have been of the secretary for not being more positive or
forward-thinking would have to involve an examination of the role
the White House played in either permitting this or not permitting
this.''
   Cavazos, whose father was a cattle foreman at the King Ranch in
Texas, was president of Texas Tech when he took over the Education
Department in the waning days of the Reagan administration. Bush
kept him in the job.
   Cavazos is the third major administration official to resign
since October. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole quit to join the
American Red Cross and William Bennett, head of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, stepped down and later was named
chairman of the Republican National Committee.
   Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
said Cavazos ``proved to be a decent man with the interest of
America's children at heart.''
   But Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers and a longtime critic of Cavazos, said, ``Basically, it
would be hard to tell what would have been different if we hadn't
had a secretary of education at all during this period of time.''
   Besides Sanders and Cheney, others considered to be possible
successors are former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean; Rep. Patricia
Saiki, a former schoolteacher who lost her November bid to unseat
Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii; and Rep. Lynn Martin, who also has
been mentioned as a possible successor to Mrs. Dole.
   Educators already are listing qualities needed for the job.
   Richard Miller, executive director of the American Association
of School Administrators, said, ``We need a person who can go to
Cabinet meetings and not just take marching orders, but speak
convincingly and forcefully at the highest levels of government
about the educational impact of whatever is proposed.''
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell, a Republican, said, ``I
look forward to the appointment of a strong, dedicated individual
... who shares the president's commitment to excellence and
diversity in education, flexibility in managing schools and
education dollars, and accountability at all levels for actual
student performance and results.''

   Five U.S. diplomats from Kuwait today abandoned their besieged
embassy and flew to Baghdad to join a last batch of Americans
leaving Iraq and the occupied emirate aboard a U.S.-chartered Iraqi
jet.
   Officials said the diplomats and 25 other Americans aboard the
Boeing 707 that landed in Baghdad would be among 94 foreigners
leaving in the afternoon on an Iraqi Airways flight to Frankfurt,
Germany, in what was said to be the last charter plane carrying out
foreign nationals.
   U.S. Ambassador Nathaniel Howell, Barbara Bodine, the deputy
chief of mission in Kuwait, and three other American diplomats from
Kuwait were whisked through the departure lounge and made no
comment in Baghdad.
   ``They are in good spirits and good shape and ready to get back
to the States,'' and American embassy official said on condition of
anonymity.
   But while Iraq was allowing the completion of a blanket hostage
release announced one week ago, it remained at odds with Washington
over when Secretary of State James A. Baker III can visit Baghdad
for talks on preventing war.
   On Wednesday, the Bush administration accused President Saddam
Hussein of blocking any agreement. The administration says Iraq's
insistence on a Jan. 12 date for the visit is too close to the Jan.
15 deadline a U.N. resolution has set for Iraq to relinquish Kuwait
or face possible attack.
   There is no disagreement over Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq
Aziz, meeting with President Bush in Washington on Monday, but the
United States says it will not receive him unless a date has been
set for Baker's visit.
   The Bush administration has suggested any time between Dec. 20
and Jan. 3.
   Also today, Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid left Baghdad for
Iran after beginning a new Arab peace mission the day before during
talks with Saddam.
   Among those waiting at the Baghdad airport for today's flight to
Frankfurt were three families who missed a Tuesday flight because
the Kuwaiti wives of Americans had to obtain Iraqi passports,
officials said.
   The embassy had no estimate on the number of Americans or other
passengers who would fly out of the country today on the
Frankfurt-bound charter.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington on
Wednesday that 15 Americans would be aboard the flight.
   Officials in Baghdad said that all others who wished to leave
Kuwait and Iraq would do so by regular flights or by ground
transportation.
   In other last-stage charter flights, 78 Japanese arrived in
Tokyo Wednesday and 313 mostly British passengers landed in London
on a chartered Iraqi Airways jet from Baghdad.
   Iraq had barred thousands of foreigners from travel after its
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. It held hundreds of them - mostly
Americans, Britons and Japanese - at strategic sites to deter a
feared attack by U.S.-led forces sent to the region in response to
the invasion.
   About 188 Americans have been evacuated from Iraq and Kuwait
over the last week. They include 70 people who were in hiding, 86
men kept as ``human shields'' and 32 private citizens who had found
refuge in U.S. compounds.
   U.S. officials estimate that about 500 Americans - most of them
children with dual citizenship - are remaining.
   Howell and his colleagues at the U.S. embassy in Kuwait defied
Iraqi orders to close in August. Gradually, all but the British and
Americans removed their diplomats as Iraq cut off utilities and
posted soldiers outside the compounds.
   Britain has joined the United States in deciding to remove its
remaining diplomats now that the last of both countries' citizens
are leaving Kuwait.
   Britain says its embassy staff will leave in the next week.
   On Nov. 30, a day after the U.N. Security Council passed the
use-of-force resolution, Bush proposed the diplomatic exchange as a
last-ditch effort to avoid war.
   Iraq accepted the idea, but Boucher complained Wednesday that
Baghdad ``continued to block agreement on dates.''
   Said the State Department spokesman: `We have offered 15 dates
and Iraq has offered none.''
   He said Baker is ``willing to go to Baghdad for a meeting on any
one of the 15 days between Dec. 20 and Jan. 3 because we think
these meetings are important and because we are serious about
them.''

<HEAD>Actress Theresa Saldana's Attacker Convicted of Sending Threatening
Letters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Actress Theresa Saldana said the conviction
of a Scottish drifter for threatening her from prison should
encourage other crime victims to fight for their rights.
   A Superior Court jury on Wednesday convicted Arthur Jackson, 55,
on five felony counts of sending death threats in letters written
in prison.
   Jackson was serving time for a knife attack on Miss Saldana
outside her West Hollywood apartment in 1982.
   ``I'm absolutely thrilled that he's been found guilty,'' Miss
Saldana said outside court. The verdicts should encourage crime
victims to ``fight long and hard and don't back down when people
tell you something is impossible.''
   Jackson faces up to 14 years in prison. He will be sentenced
under a previously untested 1986 law barring release of felons who
continue threatening victims. The law's passage stemmed from the
Saldana case. Sentencing was scheduled for Jan. 8.
   The actress, best known for her supporting role in ``Raging
Bull,'' was seated in the front row of the courtroom and let out a
small cry as the first verdict was read. She embraced and kissed
friends seated on either side of her.
   Jackson, wearing his prison uniform, showed no reaction to the
verdicts.
   Miss Saldana has devoted herself to the case since the stabbing
attack.
   ``I've been pretty much stigmatized as a victim, which is
understandable,'' she said. ``People have seen me crying on TV.
I've had to put my life ahead of my career.''
   The actress wept at trial as she told of Jackson's death
threats.
   ``He swore on the ashes of his dead mother and the scars of
Theresa Saldana that he would complete his mission of killing me,''
she said.
   Prosecutors said Jackson sent seven threatening letters in 1988
from the state hospital in Atascadero, about 150 miles northwest of
Los Angeles in San Luis Obispo County.
   Jackson testified that he attacked Miss Saldana to fulfill a
mission to be executed at San Quentin state prison.
   ``The defendant is ... still on this murderous journey that
began in 1981 in Scotland,'' Deputy District Attorney Susan Gruber
said at trial. ``His means for his own execution has been and still
is the assassination of Theresa Saldana.''
   Jackson's 14-year prison sentence for the stabbing attack was
halved because of good behavior.
   When he finishes serving time for his latest conviction, Jackson
will be turned over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service
for deportation on murder charges pending in Great Britain.

   President Bush is winning praise from farmers
and business groups by promising to allow the Soviet Union up to
$1.3 billion in loan guarantees to buy U.S. farm products and
manufactured goods.
   Citing ``tough times, difficult times'' facing the Soviet
people, Bush announced Wednesday he was waiving, through June 1991,
longstanding trade restrictions that blocked the U.S. government
from extending credit guarantees to the Soviet Union.
   Farm and business groups had lobbied hard for the credit
guarantees, arguing that without them the United States risked
being shut out of the huge Soviet market.
   The president's action will make up to $1 billion in credit
guarantees available to support the purchase of wheat, corn and
other farm products and extend up to $300 million in government
guarantees for purchase of U.S. manufactured products.
   The guarantees don't mean the United States is extending direct
aid to the Soviets. Instead, the U.S. government will promise to
repay loans put forward by commercial banks to finance the
purchases if the Soviets default on their obligations.
   Asked today if U.S. taxpayers would be stuck with the bill if
the Soviets could not repay the loans, Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher said, ``I guess eventually that's what would happen.''
   But, he said on NBC's ``Today'' show, ``we think it's worth the
gamble. ...The Soviet Union has a remarkably good record over the
years of paying all their debts.'' And he said ``the American
farmer will get some real benefits from this.''
   Farm groups saw the $1 billion proposal as only a first step,
suggesting that up to $3 billion in farm guarantees should be
considered given the need to unload bumper harvests on world
markets.
   ``This is a win-win situation,'' said South Dakota Gov. George
Mikelson. ``Both the people of the Soviet Union and the farmers of
the United States have reason to celebrate.''
   Howard Lewis, a vice president of the 15,000-member National
Association of Manufacturers, called's Bush's decision ``a first
step to allow U.S. companies to enter the Soviet market on an equal
basis with those of our trading competitors.''
   In his announcement Wednesday, Bush outlined a varied economic
aid package that included technical and medical assistance and
support for the Soviets to affiliate with the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank as ``special associates,'' which would
qualify the Soviets to get economic advice in reforming their
economy but not direct loans.
   But the key action taken by the president Wednesday was the
waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment, a 1974 law that was imposed
to penalize the Soviet Union for restricting the right of Jews and
other minority groups to leave the country.
   A presidential waiver of Jackson-Vanik was necessary for the
Soviets to qualify for the U.S. credit guarantees.
   For the past year, Bush had been insisting that he would not
waive Jackson-Vanik until the Soviet legislature put into law the
country's liberalized emigration policies.
   The law has not passed, but the administration decided to heed
the threat of critical food shortages this winter in the Soviet
Union. The change of heart also reflected a desire to reward
Gorbachev for his support of America's effort to force Iraq to
leave Kuwait.
   A waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment also is necessary to
clear the way for the Soviets to obtain preferential tariffs on
Soviet products, such as vodka and caviar, that are sold in the
United States. Soviet products now face duties that are up to 10
times as high as the tariffs imposed on other countries.
   While the lower tariffs would normalize trade relations between
the two nations for the first time in nearly a half-century, Bush
said he was withholding this economic prize until the emigration
law was passed.
   The administration said the trade agreement Bush signed with
Gorbachev in June granting the Soviets ``most favored nation''
trading status would not be forwarded to Congress for approval
until the emigration legislation is passed.
   The credit guarantees will be offered by the Commodity Credit
Corp., which supports U.S. farm purchases, and the Export Import
Bank, which provides guarantees to back purchases of manufactured
goods.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said that based on
expected demand, the Soviet guarantees of up to $1 billion could be
extended without reducing support for any other country.
   Among the U.S. businesses that have expressed interest in
obtaining credit guarantees are companies such as Upjohn, which
hopes to build pharmaceutical plants in the Soviet Union, and
International Business Machines, which is seeking to sell thousands
of personal computers to the Soviets.

<HEAD>Roman Catholic Theologians Say Vatican Hampering Renewal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 400 U.S. and Canadian Roman Catholic
theologians have accused the Vatican of stifling churh reforms,
inhibiting freedom of expression and wrongly restricting the role
of women.
   The theologians, in a statement released Wednesday, also accused
the Vatican of attempting to diminish the role of its bishops and
churches in favor of more centralized control, attacking the rights
of theologians who criticize the church and hampering the drive for
Christian unity.
   The ``role of the local churches, of their bishops, and of the
bishops' conferences is being diminished,'' the theologians
declared in the 2,400-word statement.
   It was distributed to the Catholic Theological Society of
America's 1,400 U.S. and Canadian members. Of the 544 who returned
it, 431 or 79 percent endorsed it.
   The document, issued on the 25th anniversary of the Second
Vatican Council of 1962-65, accused the church's leadership of
failing to carry out reforms called for by Vatican II.
   Instead, the theologians said, the Vatican has treated
theologians' public disagreement with church positions as defiance
and attempted to restrict their freedom of expression through
loyalty oaths and professions of faith.
   The statement, titled ``Do Not Extinguish the Spirit,'' was
drawn up by a committee headed by the Rev. John Boyle of the
University of Iowa. It took its name from an admonition by St.
Paul, the New Testament missionary-apostle.
   Development of ``legitimate public roles for women in the church
is being neglected,'' the theologians said, adding that this is
pointed up by its contrast with the increasing prominence of women
in most fields.
   ``Rather than being viewed as a sign of the times, feminism is
consistently viewed with suspicion,'' they said, adding that
candidates for bishop ``are screened to insure their unqualified
opposition to the ordination of women.''
   Concerning efforts for Christian unity, hopes that ``were so
high in the years following the council, have been disappointed''
and ``the vigor of Catholic commitment to it seems diminished,''
the theologians said.
   ``An authoritarian style of acting and inappropriate
interventions that do not respect the distinctive traditions of
churches ... rekindle fears among Orthodox, Anglicans and
Protestants that acceptance'' of the papacy ``would mean the
destruction of the distinctive traditions of their churches,'' the
theologians' statement said.

<HEAD>Popular Leningrad Anchorman Shot by Informant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The popular young anchorman of a news program on
Leningrad television was shot in the chest by a gunman claiming he
wanted to turn over secret documents, the independent Interfax news
agency reported today.
   Alexander Nevzorov, host of ``600 Seconds,'' was being treated
at the city's Military Medical Academy, but his wound was not life
threatening, said Interfax. A hospital spokesman told The
Associated Press his condition ``causes concern,'' the usual Soviet
phrase for being in serious condition.
   Nevzorov received a telephone call after Wednesday night's
broadcast from an unidentified man who said he had secret documents
to give him for a story, according to Interfax.
   The report said Nevzorov refused to go to the meeting alone, but
the caller insisted his companions remain at least 50 yards away
from them.
   Interfax said Nevzorov's companions heard a gunshot and rushed
to the anchorman who had been shot in the chest.
   ``600 Seconds,'' Leningrad TV's No. 1-rated program, has
developed a reputation for tackling the Soviet bureaucracy, and
city viewers have dubbed it ``our city scandal-monger.''
   The fast-paced show, which made its debut in December 1987,
features a large dose of crime stories, tempered by the bizarre and
offbeat, such as a feature on the city's dirtiest toilet.
   Nevzorov, who is in his early 30s, is the show's creator and
main anchor.

<TEXT>
   Retail sales fell 0.1 percent in November, the
first decline in six months, the government said today in a report
containing more evidence of a not-so-jolly Christmas shopping
season.
   Even before the Commerce Department's report, major retailers
had said their sales were off from a year earlier. Analysts
attribute the slow sales to fewer jobs and less income and anxiety
over the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $151.6
billion, down from $151.8 billion in October and the first decline
since a similar 0.1 percent drop in May. However, the revised 0.2
percent gain in October was a bit stronger than the 0.1 percent
advance originally reported.
   Automobile sales plummeted 1.3 percent, reversing a steep 1.4
percent increase in October. But some analysts said much of the
October activity came from fleet sales. Excluding the automobile
category, sales inched up 0.2 percent.
   The Thanksgiving weekend traditionally is the beginning of the
holiday shopping season that often sets the tone for the remainder
of the period. Because of slack sales, many retailers have resorted
to markdowns and other incentives to lure shoppers.
   Nevertheless, department store sales fell 0.4 percent in
November following a 0.6 percent decline a month earlier.
Department store sales often are an important barometer of consumer
activity.
   Sales of durable goods, which include cars and other items
expected to last more than three years, dropped 1.4 percent after
gaining 0.6 percent in October.
   Sales of building materials fell 2.6 percent while purchases of
furniture and other home furnishings rose 0.3 percent.
   Despite the drop in department store sales, non-durable goods
sales rose 0.5 percent after remaining unchanged the previous
month.
   Gains were recorded in sales at grocery stores, up 0.5 percent
after a 0.1 percent decline in October; apparel stores, up 0.8
percent following a 0.3 percent decrease; restaurants and bars, up
0.4 percent after a 0.9 percent drop, and drug stores, up 0.2
percent following a 0.5 percent advance.
   Gasoline station sales, which have been driven up by rising oil
prices following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, slowed to a 0.7
percent increase in November. They had risen 2.6 percent in October
and 5.6 percent in September.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of chanting,
cheering supporters today welcomed African National Congress
President Oliver Tambo on his return to South Africa after three
decades in exile.
   Nelson Mandela, the ANC's deputy president and the
anti-apartheid organization's leading figure, and other senior
leaders also greeted Tambo when his plane from Zimbabwe touched
down at Jan Smuts Airport.
   ``Viva Tambo!'' the crowds chanted as they waited for a glimpse
of the 73-year-old ANC president, who has spent the last 16 months
recovering from a stroke that left him debilitated. He walked with
a cane today.
   Foreign diplomats, including U.S. Ambassador William Swing, were
among the 5,000 people at the airport for Tambo's arrival.
   Tambo greeted ANC leaders and other guests on the airport
tarmac, warmly embracing South African Communist Party leader Joe
Slovo. Tambo chatted with ANC leaders, shaking hands and smiling.
   Asked how he was feeling, the beaming Tambo said, ``Fine, fine,
fine.'' He walked slowly with a slight limp.
   An activist draped a black-gold-and-green ANC scarf around
Tambo's neck and some 300 black airport workers encircled the
plane, cheering.
   Tambo later appeared on one level of the parking garage with
Mandela, overlooking the expectant crowd. Mandela described Tambo
as ``one of the greatest heroes of Africa.'' Tambo did not speak.
   ``At the present moment, he wishes just to say he is happy to be
amongst you,'' Mandela said, adding Tambo would address an ANC
consultative congress on Sunday.
   Mandela also urged the crowd to disperse peacefully. Scores of
riot police with dogs hastened the dispersal, but no violence
occurred.
   Earlier, cars carrying Mandela, Walter Sisulu and other ANC
leaders and their wives were mobbed by hundreds of cheering
supporters. Supporters raised clenched fists into the air and
chanted ANC slogans.
   Tambo, a former lawyer and teacher, has been overshadowed,
partly because of poor health, by Mandela. Some news reports
suggest Tambo will never again play a major role in the ANC, but
the group insists he will not step down.
   He is expected to remain in South Africa for about three weeks.
He will open the ANC's consultative congress that begins Friday in
Johannesburg.
   Tambo fled into exile in 1960 when many top opposition leaders
were detained and the ANC and other organizations banned. He
directed the movement's activity overseas, working for diplomatic
sanctions against South Africa and helping set up a guerrilla
organization in neighboring black states.
   He is expected to go to London in January for medical treatment
with no plans for him to return to South Africa in the immediate
future.
   Mandela, who set up South Africa's first black law firm with
Tambo in the early 1950s, was released from jail in February after
27 years for resisting the apartheid government.
   He swiftly took over ANC activities in South Africa and has been
the group's main representative in dealings with the government.
   President F.W. de Klerk, who legalized the ANC and other
opposition groups in February, has promised to end apartheid and
share political power with the black majority. Talks on a new
constitution are expected to begin next year.

<HEAD>Supporters of Dallas Government Overhaul Ask Judge to Order
Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of a government overhaul designed to
help minorities get elected to City Council have asked a federal
judge to order Dallas to hold an election under the new setup.
   Plaintiffs Marvin Crenshaw and Roy Williams filed a motion
Wednesday asking U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer to schedule
the election using a districting scheme.
   The city has 20 days to respond to the motion.
   On Saturday, voters rejected by 369 votes a measure under which
14 council members would would be elected from districts and the
mayor would be elected from the city as a whole. The vote was
45,255 in favor and 45,624 against.
   Under the current system, instituted in 1975, eight members are
elected from districts and three others, including the mayor, are
elected from the city at large.
   Though the plan was defeated, U.S. District Judged Jerry
Buchmeyer could institute the same plan or a similar one and call a
City Council election in May. The judge indicated he could rule as
early as January.
   Supporters said the plan would have helped ease racial
inequities that make it difficult for minorities to get elected.
Opponents said the system would have resegregated Dallas.
   The City Council will meet next week to consider hiring outside
lawyers to handle the case.
   Buchmeyer last March invalidated Dallas' current system. He said
it dilutes the voting strength of minorities, who hold two of the
11 council seats.
   Crenshaw and Williams said Saturday's referendum was the city's
idea and that now they are simply pursuing their suit to improve
minorities' political representation.
   ``This is about equal representation,'' Williams said. ``We're
using constitutional law to defend our position and put into place
a fair and equitable system of government.''
   The majority of non-minority voters who defeated the 14-1 setup
should not be allowed to suppress the rights of minority residents,
Crenshaw said.

   A new potential AIDS vaccine will be tested
in the United States for the first time in humans at San Francisco
and Los Angeles hospitals, researchers said.
   The synthetic vaccine HGP-30 will be tested at San Francisco
General Hospital and at Los Angeles County-University of Southern
California Medical Center. A dozen volunteers will be tested at
each hospital.
   ``We want to get people into the study as rapidly as possible,''
said Dr. James Kahn, assistant clinical professor of medicine at
the University of California at San Francisco. Kahn will direct the
study at San Francisco General, which is affiliated with UCSF.
   The Phase I tests will evaluate the safety of HGP-30. Later
tests would evaluate the vaccine's effectiveness in protecting
against infection with the AIDS virus.
   HGP-30 previously was tested in 18 people in England in a
yet-unpublished study, Kahn said. It was reported to be safe, but
additional studies are needed to see if it works, he said.
   Kahn said volunteers must not be infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. There is no risk of becoming infected with HIV
as a result of the test because the vaccine was synthesized and not
taken either from live or dead virus, he said.

   A strong earthquake shook a wide area of
northeastern Taiwan today, causing landslides and killing two
construction workers who were knocked off buildings where they were
working, police said.
   The Central Weather Bureau said the 11:01 a.m. quake registered
6.5 on the Richter scale and was centered on the coast about six
miles south of Hualien.
   Police in Hualien, the hardest-hit area, said one construction
worker died after falling from the second story of the building and
that a laborer shaken off a scaffold died of head injuries.
   In addition, a woman who fell during the temblor was
hospitalized with broken bones, they said.
   Police also reported several landslides in eastern Taiwan.
   The temblor also was felt in Taipei, 110 to the northwest.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one represents a tenfold increase
in intensity. An earthquake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage
in a populated area, while one of 7 is classified as a major
earthquake, capable of causing widespread, heavy damage.

   Three homes began sinking in this Southern
Illinois community after an old coal mine shaft collapsed,
authorities said.
   No injuries were reported, authorities said. Five homes were
evacuated.
   ``When I got out of the car, I noticed a crack in the concrete
(driveway). Then I got inside and heard the house popping. We could
feel the house moving,'' said Maxine Smith, who began removing
possessions from her home Wednesday evening.
   Cracks appeared in roads on the south side of this community of
about 9,600, said Interim Fire Chief Paul Marlo. In the sinking
homes, windows shattered, walls and floors cracked, and floors and
pipes burst, residents said.
   ``The houses are still shifting. We don't have any idea how long
it might be. Right now, it's just a waiting game,'' town
Superintendent Terry McEvers said late Wednesday.
   The homes began sinking Wednesday afternoon because of the mine
shaft collapse, authorities said. Abandoned mines run underneath
much of Southern Illinois, where coal mining is a major industry.
   ``There's no way of knowing the extent of the damage. The whole
area is undermined,'' Marlo said.
   As a precaution, work crews began draining a 750,000-gallon
municipal water tower near the site late Wednesday, authorities
said. Service was not affected because the town has another tower.
   ``Right now, the structure of the tower is sound, but we want to
make sure we have no problems,'' McEvers said.
   Authorities evacuated the three homes which had moved and two
across the street as a precautionary measure, Marlo said.
   ``We thought they'd better go some place else for the night,''
he said.

   Federal investigators say they will look
into whether a paper mill contributed to the heavy fog blamed for a
fiery highway pileup that killed 13 people and injured more than
50.
   Authorities said Tuesday's chain-reaction wreck apparently
started when a truck on Interstate 75 slowed because of the fog and
was rear-ended by another. That crash caused wrecks on both sides
of the highway involving 83 vehicles.
   More than a dozen vehicles caught fire as fuel tanks ruptured
and a load of organic peroxide carried by a tractor-trailor rig
ignited.
   Six people remained hospitalized in critical condition
Wednesday.
   The stretch of highway is notorious for deadly pockets of fog.
   ``This was a most unusual fog,'' said Robert Barlett, head of a
National Transportation Safety Board team investigating the crash.
``(It was) very intense and very difficult to see through. Our
investigators said this was one of the worst they had ever seen.''
   NTSB Vice Chairman Susan Coughlin said investigators would look
into whether steam from the Bowater Southern Industries mill near
the highway contributed to the fog. But she emphasized it was too
early to speculate on the cause of the accident.
   Bowater spokeswoman Astrid Sheil said mill officials believe
natural weather conditions caused Tuesday's fog. ``The weather
conditions, with the inversion from the hot air during the day time
and the cold ground, trapped the fog in,'' she said.
   A chain-reaction crash in the same area in 1978 involved 61
vehicles and injured 46 people. Three people were killed and 14
injured in a 1979 accident involving 18 vehicles.
   A study conducted after the 1978 accident concluded that the
Bowater plant appeared to be ``the primary source of fog'' in the
area.
   Barlett said th NTSB would review safety recommendations it
made about the highway to the state in 1979, including increased
patrols and a fog-detection and warning system. The state put up
fog-warning signs with flashing lights in 1980, but Barlett said
only the sign for southbound traffic was on Tuesday morning.
   Wayne Davis, a civil engineer who directed the study for the
University of Tennessee, said paper plants, which release large
amounts of steam, routinely cause fog.
   ``If you look around the nation, you will always find the
potential for dense fog around paper plants,'' he said.
   Ms. Sheil said mill officials reject the study's findings.
   Authorities originally reported 15 people killed, but lowered
the figure to 13 on Wednesday. NTSB officials said the mangled
condition of the bodies led to the incorrect figure. By this
morning, four of the 13 victims had been identified.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Office of Thrift Supervision has
taken its first major enforcement action against auditors accused
of failing to report lax savings and loan practices.
   The OTS announced Wednesday that Coopers &amp; Lybrand, one of the
nation's largest accounting firms, has agreed to tighten its
auditing procedures.
   Experts have said that accountants played an important role in
the $500 billion savings and loan scandal, but until now regulators
have focused their attention mainly on S&amp;L operators and directors.
   The charges against Coopers &amp; Lybrand stemmed from its 1986
audit of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver,
whose board of directors included President Bush's son Neil. The
collapse of Silverado in December 1988 is expected to cost
taxpayers $1 billion.
   OTS had accused Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Arthur L. Knight, who
headed the firm's team that handled the Silverado audit, of:
   -Accepting an unjustified understatement of Silverado's
allowance for loan losses on its $1.3 billion loan portfolio.
   -Relying on appraisers' judgments that were not justified by
market conditions or by financial statements applying to the
properties behind the loans.
   -Not following accounting principles.
   The loan loss allowance should have been $35 million higher, OTS
said.
   The auditors ``did not possess the expertise required to
properly complete the Silverado audit,'' the office asserted in a
legal brief released with its announcement.
   ``This is a significant case for OTS, for those who provide
professional services to insured institutions and for the public,''
said Timothy Ryan, director of the office, in a written statement.
``It says loud and clear that we hold accountants, lawyers and
other professionals accountable for their actions, just as we do
S&amp;L directors and officers.''
   In its settlement, the accounting firm agreed to meet a number
of auditing requirements over the next five years. In addition,
Knight agreed not to audit any insured savings institutions.
   ``In today's emotional and super-charged environment Coopers &amp;
Lybrand decided as a prudent business matter not to incur the
expense, aggravation and substantial publicity that would have been
associated with fighting the Office of Thrift Supervision,'' the
firm's general counsel, Harris J. Amhowitz, said in a statement.
   Amhowitz's statement indicated that Coopers &amp; Lybrand believed
its Silverado audit was not faulty.
   ``During the relevant 1986-87 period, the firm conducted several
hundred audits of savings institutions with no indication of any
endemic audit failures,'' the statement said. ``The (General
Accounting Office's) report to Congress regarding audits by various
accounting firms of failed savings associations expressed no
criticism of Coopers &amp; Lybrand's audits.''
   Coopers &amp; Lybrand agreed, among other things, to ensure that
employees on S&amp;L audits are competent, and to comply with
accounting principles for those audits.
   If Coopers &amp; Lybrand had not settled the charges, it could have
been required to participate in a public administrative hearing.
   In a separate action, OTS has charged Neil Bush with conflict of
interest in not fully disclosing his business ties with two big
Silverado borrowers. The thrift agency is seeking an administrative
order against Bush, an oil and gas developer, that could lead to
barring him from the banking and savings industries.
   Bush, 35, has denied any wrongdoing. Administrative Law Judge
Daniel J. Davidson is expected to recommend by Jan. 2 what
sanctions, if any, should be taken against Bush.
   The president's son and other former Silverado directors, as
well as the thrift's law firm, have been charged with negligence in
a $200 million lawsuit filed in September by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.

<HEAD>North Korea Criticizes Seoul for Failing to Sign Non-Aggression
Pact</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   North Korea sharply criticized South
Korea for failing to sign a non-aggression pact at high-level talks
today and claimed the Seoul government had improperly arrested
dissidents.
   ``South Korea is making fun of the high-level talks,'' said An
Byong Su, spokesman for the North Korean delegation, after today's
final session of the two-day meeting between the two countries'
prime ministers.
   He also charged South Korea with making ``a hostile and
provocative act against the North'' by arresting three dissidents
for unauthorized contacts with North Koreans in Berlin at the end
of November.
   Today's talks, the third round since September, are the
highest-level meetings between the two Koreas since the peninsula
was divided in 1945 and the border tightly sealed. The North Korean
delegation returns home Friday.
   The meeting between North Korean Premier Yon Hyong Muk and his
South Korean counterpart, Kang Young-hoon, was held in a tense
atmosphere, created in part by the televised departure of South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo for a four-day state visit to the
Soviet Union.
   The Soviet Union is an ally of the Communist North, which has
denounced the trip, the first since Moscow established relations
with Seoul two months ago.
   The two premiers failed to sign any agreements during the
two-day meeting, but officials said they tenatively planned to meet
again on Feb. 25 through Feb. 28 in North Korea's capital,
Pyongyang.
   Signing a pledge of non-aggression has been the focus of the
talks.
   North Korea and South Korea fought a three-year war in the early
1950s, and the border between them is the most heavily fortified
permanent demarcation in the world.
   Although both sides have proposed non-aggression pacts, South
Korea has insisted any agreement be part of a broader accord
including exchanges and cooperation to build mutual trust.
   ``South Korea was indecisive and wayward,''said An, the North
Korean spokesman. ``The non-aggression statement is not a useless
piece of paper.''
   North Korea has repeatedly demanded the release of all South
Korean dissidents jailed for contacting North Koreans in defiance
of South Korean law. South Korea has accused the North of meddling
in domestic politics.
   ``We feel sorry the meeting ended without any good results,''
said Limb Dong-won, a delegate and South Korea's spokesman. He said
there were ``sharp discussions on the issues.''
   If another round of talks is held in February, it will be near
the time of the annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises, which
the North has demanded be halted. North Korea has suggested it
might boycott future talks if the exercises take place. South Korea
has indicated it will scale back the exercise if the talks show
progress.
   In a departure statement today, Roh said his visit to the Soviet
Union signaled the confontation between the two Koreas was coming
to an end.
   ``The very fact that I am the first president of the Republic of
Korea to visit the Soviet Union signifies that the Cold War is
fading away on the Korean peninsula,'' Roh said.
   Roh will hold two rounds of talks with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and visit Leningrad before returning home on Monday.

   A 100-pound propane tank caught fire five flights
below ground at a downtown construction site today, forcing
evacuation of workers before the blaze was extinguished,
authorities said.
   The fire began at about 7:30 a.m. After firefighters managed to
extinguish the blaze, they removed the tank from the site near
International Place, said Deputy Fire Chief Paul Christian.
   If the tank had blown up, it ``would have looked like the
Challenger thing that blew up,'' Christian said.
   Construction workers use the propane tanks to pre-heat
construction columns before they are welded. Other propane tanks
were also in the area.
   Christian said he does not know how the tank ignited.
   The fire forced the evacuation of construction workers, and
police closed off streets in the area.

<TEXT>
   Police today arrested and jailed a
former deputy prime minister, one day after deposed President
Hussain Muhammad Ershad was put under house arrest, a news agency
reported.
   United News of Bangladesh said Shah Moazzem Hossain, a close
Ershad aide, was arrested under the same law that was used to
detain Ershad and his family for 120 days. The law, which the
caretaker government had promised to rescind, permits arrests
without charges.
   Shah Moazzem is the second minister in Ershad's government to be
arrested since the president resigned on Dec. 6 and appointed
Supreme Court Chief Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed as caretaker
president. The United News of Bangladesh did not say where he was
arrested. Police earlier put Ershad's powerful home minister,
Mahmudul Hassan, under house arrest.
   Most ministers and officials in the previous government went
into hiding after Ershad, a former army general, gave up power in
response to seven weeks of popular protests.
   Ershad, his wife, Raushan, and their 8-year-old son, Shahd, are
now confined in a house in Dhaka's Gulshan diplomatic enclave while
the caretaker government prepares corruption charges against
Ershad.
   United News of Bangladesh said police have orders to arrest at
least 16 ministers and officials of Ershad's government.
   Ershad seized power ina 1982 bloodless coup. Major opposition
parties often accused him of authoritarian rule.
   Ershad could face charges of subverting the constitution for
allegedly rigging the vote in two parliamentary elections and a
presidential election. He may also be accused of unlawful business
deals.
   The caretaker government has been under intense pressure from
political parties and university students to try Ershad on charges
of corruption and abusing power during his eight-year rule.

   The Soviet Union appears to have softened its
demand that Israel accept an international peace conference with
the Arabs.
   But the Kremlin is still balking at resuming full diplomatic
relations with the Jewish state, which it severed 23 years ago in a
show of solidarity with Israel's Arab neighbors.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir discussed their relationship at a
previously unscheduled meeting Wednesday. Most of the session was
devoted to discussion of the Persian Gulf crisis and the settlement
of the Arab-Israeli dispute, Shevardnadze said.
   Shamir met Secretary of State James Baker today and described
Israel's assessment of the Iraqi threat to Israel and to the
region. He urged that the United States keep in mind these concerns
when making decisions about resolving the gulf crisis.
   ``Baker told him the administration understands well our
concerns and has them clearly in mind,'' said an Israeli diplomat.
   The Soviets, who asked for the meeting with Shamir, have been
eager to carve a bigger role in Mideast diplomacy, which has
traditionally been conducted under U.S. auspices.
   ``I think it was a very necessary and useful talk,''
Shevardnadze told reporters at a brief news conference with Shamir.
   Shamir said he told Shevardnadze of Israel's desire for
resumption of diplomatic ties ``as soon as possible.''
   Shevardnadze indicated that he was no longer insisting Israel
must agree to participate in a Mideast peace conference before
diplomatic ties could be renewed.
   ``No, we're not setting any preconditions,'' he said in response
to a question at a brief news conference with Shamir at his side.
   ``We are moving toward'' full ties, Shevardnadze said. ``The
process is developing in normal fashion'' with the renewal of
consular ties recently and the flourishing of economic and cultural
programs.
   The two leaders appeared to have set aside their differences
over an international peace conference. ``Let us not talk about a
conference now,'' Shevardnadze said laughingly, eliciting a chuckle
from Shamir.
   Shamir and Shevardnadze appeared to agree that priority must now
be given to removing Iraq from Kuwait - the same approach the
Israeli leader agreed on with President Bush at their meeting
Tuesday. Bush and Shamir said stalled Arab-Israeli peace talks
would have to wait until the gulf crisis was resolved.
   The Soviets have joined the United States is seeking to scuttle
a proposed United Nations Security Council resolution by some Arab
states and their allies that would call for an international
Mideast conference to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Moscow decided to support the United States because it doesn't
want to placate Iraqi attempts to link its pullout from Kuwait to
Israeli withdrawal from the lands it captured in the 1967 Mideast
war.
   The Soviet minister said he and Shamir discussed the need for
peace talks between Israel and the Arabs. ``Whether bilateral or
multilateral, we'll consult about that,'' he said.
   Shamir agreed, thanking Shevardnadze for his ``sincere desire''
to solve the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   Earlier, Shamir had ruled out an international peace conference.
   ``Israel will not participate in such a conference and Israel
will not accept imposed solutions,'' he told an American Enterprise
Institute conference before meeting with Shevardnadze.
   Instead, Israel wants direct talks with its Arab neighbors as
outlined in a four-point peace plan Shamir proposed last year.
   But U.S.-backed efforts to implement the plan broke down earlier
this year in disagreement over one of its major elements -
elections among the 1.7 million Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   Shamir made clear Israel hadn't changed its mind about excluding
the Palestine Liberation Organization from the elections, and said
he hoped the PLO's support for Iraq had convinced the world it
wasn't a suitable peace partner.
   Shevardnadze thanked Shamir for his endorsement of Bush's
decision to temporarily waive the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment
limiting trade with the Soviets unless they allow free emigration.
   Bush announced his decision to Shevardnadze at the White House
earlier Wednesday.
   Israel and its supporters in Congress had spearheaded opposition
for 15 years to trade concessions because of the Soviets' human
rights abuses.
   But over the past year, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
has allowed 150,000 Jews to leave for Israel.
   Shamir said he renewed Israeli demands that the Kremlin allow
direct airline flights to Israel. Shevardnadze said he hoped such
flights could be arranged soon, Shamir said.

   A woman fighting in court to have her
child treated with traditional Chinese medicine rather than surgery
has won a round, but the state retains custody of the little girl.
   Juliet Cheng, a Chinese immigrant, has been fighting the state
Department of Children and Youth Services for five months over
treatment for her 7-year-old daughter, Shirley, who has rheumatoid
arthritis.
   The state wanted doctors to operate on Shirley's joints, which
are swollen and partly immobile.
   Cheng wanted Shirley treated with acupuncture, herbal medicines
and massage.
   On Tuesday, two of three doctors approved by a federal judge to
examine the girl recommended against surgery. Cheng's attorney,
George Athanson, said he thinks their recommendation would
invalidate a Juvenile Court order authorizing surgery.
   For now, Shirley remains at Newington Children's Hospital, and
the Department of Children and Youth Services will retain custody
until the issue is resolved in Juvenile Court, after the state
submits final recommendations on treatment and custody, DCYS
spokesman Thomas Moriarty said Wednesday.
   Moriarty would not say if the state has decided to give up its
attempts to force surgery, but said officials will use the
recommendations of the court-sanction panel of doctors as the basis
for its report to the court.
   State Attorney General Clarine Nardi Riddle also said Wednesday
that her office has not made a decision on whether to seek to
retain custody or seek a new order for surgery.
   Shirley has been at Newington since July, when the state took
temporary custody after Cheng refused to allow surgery.
   Cheng won a reprieve in October, when U.S. District Judge T.
Emmet Clarie approved an agreement allowing her to use the
treatment of her choice for two months.
   Because she was unable to find a Chinese practitioner who also
was a medical doctor, as required by the court, Cheng chose Dr.
William Shevin, a homeopathic physician from Woodstock.
   Shevin has used physical therapy and small doses of natural
medicines, including poison ivy and phosphorous, which he says has
reduced severe swelling in Shirley's joints.
   Cheng said she just wants her daughter home.
   ``I haven't missed a day in five months visiting her at the
hospital and I want her to come home,'' Cheng said.

   The sister of Terry Anderson, the longest-held
American hostage in Beirut, says she's going to Lebanon next month
and won't come back without her brother.
   Peggy Say accused the Bush administration Wednesday of doing too
little to free Anderson and five other American hostages in Beirut.
   ``I know in my dealings with the administration, I have begged
and pleaded and threatened and cajoled and cannot make them act,''
she told The Associated Press.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped nearly six years ago.
   Say said a State Department ban on travel to Lebanon does not
apply to families of hostages, but officials still do not want her
to go.
   ``I'm being, of course, greatly discouraged by the State
Department, and I've told them they can stop me from going very
easily - give me my brother,'' she said in an earlier interview
with WPSD television in Paducah. ``This is a private initiative ...
born of frustration and desperation and fear that Terry will not
survive much longer.''
   ``I simply have no choice,'' she said. ``The administration has
given me no choice.''
   The Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a former Beirut hostage once
held with Anderson, may go to Lebanon with her, she said.
   Say said former hostages have told her their Lebanese captors
wanted to release them but would not do so without Iran's approval.
   Iran has refused her an entry visa, ``but I can approach the
Iranians indirectly in Beirut, and I can't fail Terry any longer,''
she said. ``When I go, I want to be prepared and the people with me
to stay for a while because I don't intend to come back without
Terry.''

<TEXT>
   The republic of Georgia has imposed a curfew and
other state of emergency restrictions on a small separatist enclave
where violence broke out after Georgia abolished the enclave's
autonomy, it was reported today.
   The clampdown in South Ossetia on Wednesday night followed three
fatal shootings in the capital of Tskhinvali earlier in the day,
the independent Interfax news service reported.
   The Georgian Supreme Soviet on Tuesday ended 68 years of
autonomy in South Ossetia, which last week elected a legislature
and declared sovereignty. Ethnic Georgians living in the region
boycotted the vote, according to Interfax.
   South Ossetia, located in northern Georgia, had been one of 20
autonomous republics in the Soviet Union with limited jurisdiction
over their affairs, having delegated many functions to their host
republic.
   But now that all 15 republics have declared various degrees of
independence from the federal government in Moscow, citizens of
autonomous republics are also clamoring for greater autonomy.
   South Ossetia, about the size of Rhode Island, has about 100,000
people. About 65 percent are Ossetian and 30 percent Georgian.
   Interfax said unidentified gunmen driving a car along
Tskhinvali's Lenin Street on Wednesday fired a submachine gun at
two cars, killing a police officer, the bodyguard of the Georgian
Supreme Soviet's chairman, and a civilian. Two other people were
wounded, the report said.
   Interfax said the state of emergency affects Tskhinvali and the
neighboring Dzhavsky district, and will be enforced by national and
Georgian Interior Ministry troops and Georgian KGB officers.
   Interfax said the Georgian Supreme Soviet passed a new
state-of-emergency law on Tuesday giving the commander of the
troops wide powers to control the media, ban rallies and other
public demonstrations and control entry to and exit from the
region.
   It said he could forbid certain residents from leaving their
homes or the area, banish non-residents, confiscate firearms and
other weapons from citizens and military training equipment from
plants and organizations, and ban the use of radio and TV
transmitters.

   A lawyer who once worked on the Iran-Contra
investigation and then wrote an insider book about the case has
been ordered to turn over documents to his former boss, special
prosecutor Lawrence Walsh.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan said Wednesday that lawyer
Jeffrey Toobin must produce by next Thursday all documents that he
took with him when he left Walsh's Office of Independent Counsel in
1989.
   Walsh sought the documents after Toobin and his publisher,
Penguin Books USA, accused him in a lawsuit of trying to block
publication of the book, ``Opening Arguments: A Young Lawyer's
First Case - United States v. Oliver North.''
   The book is scheduled for publication by Viking next year,
according to Penguin, Viking's parent corporation.
   Walsh claims the book improperly discloses staff discussions and
internal memos and violates grand jury secrecy. Keenan ruled that
Walsh has the right to see the documents Toobin collected at while
working for the special prosecutor to determine whether there is
evidence for his charges.
   The lawsuit denies that the book contains illegal disclosures,
and asks Keenan to bar Walsh from doing anything to prevent
distribution of the book.
   Another hearing is scheduled for Jan. 3.
   Toobin, 30, currently is an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn.

   An apprentice engineer was at the controls - and
reportedly speeding - when his Amtrak train jumped the tracks in a
station and slammed into a rush-hour commuter train, injuring 264
people, authorities said.
   Published reports today, disputed by Amtrak, said the train was
traveling at least twice the 30 mph limit in Back Bay Station when
it crashed Wednesday morning.
   In Washington, Amtrak spokesman Patrick Jeffery said the train's
speed had yet to be determined.
   ``There were some witnesses who felt the train was going very
fast. We don't base our information on that,'' he said in a
telephone interview. A diagram of the crash did not suggest high
speeds were involved, he said.
   Jeffery confirmed a published report that the apprentice
engineer had begun operating the Washington-Boston line on a
regular basis only on Monday. But he said the apprentice had been
operating trains under supervision since 1987 and had been tested
on his familiarity on that line.
   Amtrak denied inexperience caused the crash because the
apprentice was supervised by an experienced engineer.
   ``He wasn't doing it alone. We don't consider that was a factor
at this point. (But) we really don't know,'' Jeffery said.
   Amtrak's Night Owl from Washington traveled nearly a
quarter-mile after derailing, then struck the rear of the
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority train, said Thomas
Glynn, MBTA general manager.
   The impact was so violent that Amtrak cars hit the tunnel's
ceiling and buckled the road above.
   Glynn said 264 people were injured, 10 critically. The commuter
train had its usual load of about 900 passengers, and the Amtrak
train had about 190, he said.
   ``All the lights went out, people started screaming, the place
was filled with smoke, a few people were trapped under seats,''
said commuter Chris Good.
   Most of the injured suffered cuts, bruises, broken bones and
smoke inhalation from a fire caused when 1,500 gallons of spilled
diesel ignited.
   Back Bay Station will be closed until at least Monday while the
wreckage is cleared, and thousands of commuters are taking buses
into downtown Boston.
   ``Commuting is fine this morning. Everything is working fine,''
transit authority spokesman Bob Devin said today. He said MBTA
personnel were stationed around the system to direct commuters
whose routes were changed.
   The apprentice, Richard Abramson, 41, of Trumbull, Conn., had
three years' training on how to operate a locomotive and was
authorized to run a train under a senior engineer's supervision,
said Dave Beatty, Amtrak general supervisor. Abramson was
hospitalized in stable condition with a broken collar bone, an
injured back and facial injuries.
   ``He was qualified to do the job,'' Amtrak spokesman Howard
Robertson said. ``He was qualified in the rules, in the opeation
of the engine, in the route and the rails. He had proper training
and we don't think it (inexperience) had anything to do with the
crash.''
   Abramson was operating the train under the supervision of
25-year veteran engineer Willis Copeland, Beatty said. Copeland,
53, of Bethany, Conn., was critically injured.
   Copeland was the engineer on one of the trains in a head-on
collision in New York City in 1984 in which one person was killed
and 115 were injured, said Amtrak spokeswoman Marci Larson. But
Copeland was ``completely exonerated,'' Larson said.
   The Boston Globe, citing sources it didn't identify, said
Abramson had started operating trains on regular Amtrak routes only
two days before the crash. The Globe said Abramson had worked for
Amtrak since 1973, first as a clerk, then a yard engineer.
   The Globe and the Boston Herald quoted unidentified sources as
saying the Night Owl was traveling at least twice Back Bay
Station's speed limit when it crashed. The train had been scheduled
to stop at the station before heading to its last stop at South
Station in downtown Boston.
   ``We'll be looking at pre-existing damage on the tracks. Same
thing on the wheels of the train,'' said Ted Lopatkiewicz, a member
of a National Transportation Safety Board team dispatched to the
scene. ``We'll look at human performance, what the crew did, their
background.''
   A similar crash occurred at the station between an Amtrak train
and a commuter train in 1987. The NTSB determined that crash, which
caused far less damage, was caused by an improperly designed signal
system, with human error a secondary factor.
   ``We'll be very interested in seeing if there are any
connections,'' said NTSB spokesman Brent Bahler.
   The Federal Railroad Administration also sent inspectors and
subjected the train crews to alcohol and drug tests, mandatory
after serious rail accidents.
   The two Amtrak locomotives and a baggage car were destroyed in
the collision. Fire Lt. Mike Walsh, one of the first on the scene,
said the massive locomotives were twisted ``like a coat hanger.''
   Firefighters emerging from the tunnel said most passengers did
not panic. ``There was an eerie calm,'' Walsh said.
   Some firemen handed oxygen masks to victims. Most of the
passengers were able to walk out of the station, but a number were
carried out on stretchers. At least nine had to be extracted from
the wreckage, Walsh said.
   Passengers emerging from the train described being thrown to the
floor, bruising their faces and necks. They said the lights in the
trains went out, leaving them groping through a dense smoke that
passenger Joe Povoas said ``you could grind with your teeth, you
could spit it out.''

<TEXT>
   Japan's parliament today approved $1 billion to
help support the U.S-led multinational force deployed against Iraq
- the final portion of $2 billion already pledged to the force by
Tokyo.
   The vote in the lower house of the Diet, or parliament, came two
days after a Pentagon spokesman accused Japan of being slow to send
the funds. The opposition-controlled upper house is expected to
vote against the bill, but Japan's constitution allows lower house
decisions to prevail on budget matters.
   In all, Japan has pledged $4 billion in aid resulting from the
Persian Gulf crisis - $2 billion for the multinational forces and
$2 billion for nations suffering from the international trade
embargo against Iraq.
   Japanese officials denied on Wednesday that Japan was dragging
its feet in disbursing the funds.
   On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said
Japan and Germany, two of the world's leading economic powers, had
delivered barely one-fifth of the money and materials they promised
for allied military operations in the gulf.
   Japanese officials said of the $2 billion pledged for the
military forces, about $900 million had been allocated as a Gulf
Peace Fund and more than half of that had been contracted or spent.
Another $100 million had been spent or contracted for transport and
medical aid, they added on condition of anonymity.
   The remaining $1 billion was approved today.
   The officials blamed delays on disbursement of $600 million in
emergency commodity loans to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey on red tape
in the recipient countries.
   The disbursement of another $400 million for front-line states
has been pledged, they said.
   Japan, which imports nearly all of its oil, has not sent troops
to the gulf. It cited its postwar constitution, drafted under U.S.
occupation, that banned the use of military force to settle
international disputes.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party also proposed sending
troops for non-combat roles with the gulf forces but abandoned the
plan after encountering strong opposition. The government now is
considering a new bill to allow sending non-military personnel for
service with peacekeeping missions.
   U.S. sources said Monday that Operation Desert Shield, the U.S.
military response to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, may cost $30
billion in 1991. The Pentagon's original cost estimate was $15
billion, but that was before President Bush ordered huge
reinforcements to the gulf on Nov. 8.

   The Defense Department has approved a $3.5
billion Army plan to build an improved version of the Apache attack
helicopter, the Army said today.
   Under a full-scale development contract expected to be signed
this month by McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co., of Mesa, Ariz., 227
existing Apache helicopters wll be modified to fire a new version
of the Hellfire anti-radar missile.
   The airframes of the Apaches also will be modified to give it
increased electrical power, increased cooling and other features
that will enable it to operate better in adverse weather, said Maj.
Nancy Burt, an Army public affairs officer.
   Hundreds of Apaches are deployed in Saudi Arabia with troops in
Operation Desert Shield.
   The Army got the official go-ahead for the ``Longbow Apache''
project last Friday from John A. Betti, the Pentagon procurement
chief who announced Wednesday that he is resigning effective Dec.
31. The Defense Acquisition Board, which reviews most major weapons
programs, approved the Apache plan last Wednesday.
   Work on the Longbow Apache will be performed at McDonnell
Douglas' plant in Mesa.
   The first Longbow Apache is to be delivered to the Army in April
1996.
   Martin Marietta Electronics and Missiles Groups in Orlando,
Fla., and Baltimore-based Westinghouse Missile Systems Division are
jointly developing the Apache's new radar.

   Critically serious budget problems will
dominate the agendas of legislatures across the country in 1991,
say state lawmakers who will struggle amid slumping economic
conditions.
   Two-thirds of states expect major difficulty in balancing their
budgets, legislative leaders reported in a survey conducted this
month by the National Conference of State Legislatures.
   States facing the most acute financial troubles include
California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas, the
lawmakers reported.
   The budget crunch at the state level is ``as serious as it was
in 1982'' when the country was coming out of a recession, Maine
House Speaker John Martin, president of the group, said at a news
conference today.
   ``Potentially it could get worse,'' Martin said.
   The worsening conditions ``seem to be progressing at a faster
rate'' than in the early '80s, he said.
   State economies are slowing, revenues and reserves are falling
and unemployment is rising, the state legislators said. Major state
expenditures continue to grow, especially for Medicaid, corrections
and education, the leaders reported.
   Adding to the states' woes are federally mandated changes in
programs such as Medicaid, with the states paying the bill for the
revisions.
   Original revenue estimates for 1991 are being lowered in about
half the states in the country, the legislative leaders said in the
survey.
   It will be about a year and a half before state finances
stabilize, said Martin, a Democrat serving as president this year
of the National Conference of State Legislatures.
   Other top-priority issues in state legislatures next year will
be tax reform, education and the environment, according to the
survey.
   Taxes will be seen in some cases as partial antidotes to state
financial woes.
   New Hampshire will consider broadening the base of its business
profits tax and Louisiana will decide whether to continue the
suspension of certain sales tax exemptions, the legislative leaders
reported. Tennessee will consider alternatives, including a
personal income tax, to finance an education reform package.
   Property tax reform also will be a major issue in some states.
Wisconsin may reduce dependence on local property taxes for
education, relying instead on using lottery proceeds, according to
the study.
   In the survey, legislative leaders reported that:
   -California faces a revenue shortfall that may reach $1 billion
in fiscal 1991, with a shortfall of up to $5.9 billion the
following year.
   -New York and Florida face mounting budget shortfalls, despite
substantial tax increases last year.
   -Texas faces a shortfall, too, even though higher energy prices
are a boost to the state economy.
   -Pennsylvania faces a $1.5 billion shortfall and the governor
there opposes tax increases and recommends cuts in spending to
solve the problem.

   Air force planes and helicopter
gunships strafed and bombed Tamil rebel camps in northeastern Sri
Lanka today, killing at least 40 guerrillas, military officials
said.
   They said five or six vehicles were also destroyed in the air
raid on the camps located near Kokkilai village, 155 miles
northeast of Colombo, near the port town of Trincomalee.
   ``At least 40 rebels are believed to have been killed in the
operation which lasted over four hours,'' said the officials who
cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   The report could not be independently confirmed, and there was
no immediate response from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
which has been fighting for an independent nation in the northern
and eastern regions since 1983.
   Officials said the air attack was launched following reports
from military intelligence.
   This is the second major air offensive against Tiger rebels
since they overran an important military camp last month in the
northern region of Mankulam, killing at least 100 soldiers.
   The loss of Mankulam was one of the worst setbacks suffered by
the government since the rebels broke a 13-month ceasefire last
June.
   Fifteen guerrillas were killed in November when government
planes destroyed a convoy of Tamil Tiger trucks in Jaffna
peninsula, the island's northern-most area and a rebel stronghold.
   Deputy Defence Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said today that troops
killed two rebels hiding in the Karaitivu refugee camp in the
eastern Batticaloa district. He said two others swallowed cyanide
pills when they were captured.
   ``These terrorists on the run now hide inside refugee camps of
innocent Tamils and attack forces,'' said Wijeratne. ``But we have
been tipped off and are taking appropriate action.''
   The government routinely describes Tamil militants as
terrorists.
   Wijeratne said 18 suspected rebels were arrested from the
Karaitivu camp.
   More than 14,000 people have been killed in the 7-year-old
separatist campaign.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million
people, complain they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese in jobs, education and language. Sinhalese, who make up
75 percent of the population, control the government and military.

   Governments and relief groups in 22
countries have sent or promised food aid to the Soviet Union. The
Soviet government says 2,500 metric tons of food aid and medical
supplies have already arrived.
   In addition, President Bush said on Wednesday that he was making
the Soviets eligible for up to $1 billion in credits to buy U.S.
agricultural products ranging from grain to cheese.
   Here is a breakdown of the international aid offered so far:
   ---
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   -The European Community expects this weekend to adopt a two-year
package including $1 billion in emergency food grants and credit
guarantees, plus $1.4 billion in technical and administrative aid.
   -The German government has approved shipment of the Berlin
stockpile - 214,500 tons of meat, milk and medicine stored for 40
years to thwart another Soviet blockade - plus 35,000 tons of army
reserve supplies.
   -The Red Cross, CARE, Roman Catholic and Lutheran aid agencies
have sent truck convoys and air shipments with tons of food worth
several hundred thousand dollars.
   -The Japanese government says it will provide technological
assistance in transportation and distribution. The municipal
government of Kawasaki, south of Tokyo, sent the first Japanese aid
Tuesday - $92,300 worth of hypodermic needles, syringes and other
medical supplies.
   -The Swedish government today approved export credits for
500,000 tons of wheat and expects to grant credits for an
additional million tons soon. A truck carrying the first Swedish
aid left for Leningrad on Tuesday carrying meat, powdered milk and
medicines gathered by a private aid group.
   -The Norwegian government has appropriated $1.7 million for food
aid to be distributed mainly in the Arctic border region.
Individual Norwegians and church groups have sent food and clothes.
   -The British government in November established a ``know-how
fund'' of nearly $10 million to give technical assistance in
agriculture and food distribution over two years. British
schoolchildren are collecting canned food.
   -Swiss Army volunteers plan to drive a convoy of 320 tons of
food from army stocks to Moscow and Leningrad after Jan. 1. The
Swiss government promised a 40-ton emergency airlift and said 1,000
tons of Swiss cheese were available.
   -The Italian group Together for Peace has shipped nearly 100
tons of cheese, milk, vegetables and medical supplies.
   -In Israel, the Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental group which
resettles Soviet emigres, sent 25 tons of fruit, vegetables and
powdered milk.
   -Austria has promised 100,000 food parcels and medical supplies.
   -Australia signed an agreement in Moscow on Nov. 25 to give the
Soviet Union up to $400 million worth of credits to buy Australian
wool, wheat and other commodities.
   -U.S. private aid groups, including AmeriCares and CARE, have
sent at least 100,000 pounds of medical supplies and food packages.
   -Spain, France and Canada have offered financial aid to buy
food.
   -India plans to loan the Soviets 1 million tons of wheat and to
give 20,000 tons of rice as well as medicines, medical supplies and
processed food.

   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi said today
after a meeting with President Bush that peace prospects for his
country have improved as a result of a joint efforts by the United
States and the Soviet Union.
   ``I think both the United States and the Soviet Union are
joining hands in trying to find a solution to the Angolan
problem,'' Savimbi said after a 20-minute meeting with Bush, during
which he thanked the president for U.S. support for his forces.
   He said his goal is a truce in early 1991 and free and fair
elections by the end of the year. He said the rival factions in
Angola are close to a settlement.
   The anti-communist rebel leader met with Bush after an
unprecedented meeting on Wednesday with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze. After the White House meeting, a five-party
discussion was held to work on what Savimbi described as the
``parameters'' of a peace settlement.
   U.S., Soviet and Portuguese officials were involved along with
representatives of Angola's two warring factions. Portugal has been
playing a mediating role in peace negotiations involving its former
African colony.
   A State Department official, insisting on anonymity, said the
Shevardnadze meeting with Savimbi was of ``immense importance,''
given the 15 years of unswerving support Moscow has given to
Angola's MPLA government.
   ``It demonstrated that the Soviet Union wants to become fully
engaged in the peace process in Angola,'' the official said, adding
that it also ``sends a strong signal'' to the Angolan government.
   It was just a year ago that Washington and Moscow cooperated in
bringing about an end to the civil war in Nicaragua by supporting a
process that included free and fair elections.
   After his 45-minute meeting with Shevardnadze at the Soviet
embassy, Savimbi indicated the Soviets seem interested in applying
the same formula to Angola.
   ``The foreign minister has assured us of their desire to help
the Angolans achieve peace, stability and democracy,'' Savimbi
said. ``The most important thing is that all the big powers
understand they can cooperate to find peace and stability of our
country.''
   Shevardnadze said that if the MPLA government and the UNITA
rebels are able to reach a cease-fire agreement, ``then it would be
easier for us to address the possibility of a cutoff of arms.''
   The Soviets have been a generous arms supplier to the government
since the leftist MPLA took power in 1975 after Portugal ended
centuries of colonial rule in Angola.
   Among the prerequisites for a settlement, according to UNITA,
are assurances that its representatives will be able to participate
freely and fairly i a political process that will culminate in
internationally supervised elections.
   As Savimbi met with Shevardnadze, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III conferred with Angolan Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro
Van Dunem.
   The State Department said Baker urged Van Dunem to persuade his
government to make the necessary final compromises to reach a
peaceful solution.
   Van Dunem said afterward only that progress is being made toward
an agreement that can lead to a cease-fire.

   William Bennett today told President Bush that
he would not accept the chairmanship of the Republican National
Committee, citing financial reasons.
   Bennett, who recently resigned as the nation's drug policy
director, told President Bush in a letter that taking the job would
conflict with planned outside interests, including a book contract.
   Therefore, Bennett told Bush, he was turning down the offer
``with the deepest reluctance.'' The White House released a copy of
the letter.
   Bennett was chosen for the top party post in November when
President Bush decided to replace ailing Lee Atwater, who is
undergoing treatment for a brain tumor.
   Bennett told reporters that lawyers, including White House
counsel Boyden Gray, had indicated that ethics considerations
involved in financial activities he wanted to conduct presented
enough of a ``gray area'' for him to turn down the job.
   The conflicts, he said, would preclude him from carrying out a
Simon and Schuster book contract, as well as consulting and
speaking engagements he wanted to do.
   ``I didn't take a vow of poverty,'' Bennett said.
   He said he had spoken to several lawyers in addition to Gray,
including his personal lawyer Robert Barnett, and his brother
Robert Bennett.
   `` have now determined, with the deepest reluctance, that I
cannot serve as both chairman of the Republican National Committee
and fulfill these personal and other professional
responsibilities,'' Bennett said in his letter.
   ``Among these is a longstanding contractural commitment to Simon
and Schuster to write two books. They have recently advised,
underestandably, that they cannot extend my commitment to them for
yet another two years,'' he added.
   Traditionally, the head of the party has been allowed to have
outside income, as has the head of the Democratic National
Committee.
   However, the fact that Bennett would go right from government
service into the party position puts him under an ethics law that
limits his outside activities for one year.
   Bennett himelf mentioned this, telling Bush ``I am now advised
by legal counsel that federal ethics law could be interpreted to
limit substantially my involvement in private sector activities''
while serving as RNC chairman during that first year.
   ``I would not want this to create an apperance of impropriety,''
Bennett told Bush.
   He vowed to help the president in his re-election campaign and
told Bush: ``nothing in federal ethics law prevents me from
continuing to speak out on behalf of you and the policies of your
administration.''
   Bennett's decision came amid widespread dissatisfaction among
party regulars with Bush's choice. Bennett is a staunch
conservative who had no political campaign experience and was seen
by some as a poor choice to run the party machinery during the 1992
election cycle.
   Bennett had made his first formal appearance as the designated
party chairman on Monday, before the Republican Governors
Association conference in Pinehurst, N.C. There was no hint then
that he was having second thoughts.
   ``Don't forget - I'm not elected yet,'' he told them. The
Republican National Committee meets Jan. 25 for what was to have
been automatic approval of Bush's choice.

<HEAD>Top Terrorism Investigator Commits Suicide, Autopsy Ordered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's top terrorism investigator, who was
heavily criticized for freeing an Iranian implicated in bombings
that terrorized Paris in 1986, died today after shooting himself in
the mouth.
   Judge Gilles Boulouque, 40, was eulogized by former Prime
Minister Jacques Chirac as a man of great integrity who brought ``a
very important contribution to the fight against terrorism.''
   Boulouque died shortly after midnight of the self-inflicted
gunshot wound, police said. The state prosecutor immediately
ordered an autopsy.
   Police sources said they found a letter addressed to Boulouque's
wife concerning his intended suicide. The sources said without
elaborating that the letter indicated his motives were personal.
Investigators said earlier they had no doubt Boulouque's death at
his Montmartre home was a suicide.
   Boulouque made his reputation investigating the series of deadly
Paris bombings in 1986. He gained notoriety as the man who let an
Iranian Embassy employee at the center of the investigation fly
home in November 1987.
   Boulouque's decision to free Iranian Embassy translator Wahid
Gordji at the height of the investigation put him at the center of
a political-legal controversy and led to public derision.
   For months, Boulouque had tried to interview Gordji, considered
Iran's No. 2 man in France. But Gordji, locked up inside his
mission, refused to come out. The decision to allow him to return
to Iran was a major step in re-establishing French-Iranian
diplomatic ties.
   A Tunisian, Fouad Ali Saleh, was eventually convicted of heading
the terrorist ring responsible for the Paris bombings. During
Boulouque's investigation, Saleh accused the investigator of
violating secrecy laws regarding the probe. The accusation never
resulted in a trial.
   Boulouque had worked under tight security since 1986, riding in
an armored car, surrounded by bodyguards and carrying his own
pistol, officials said. He received numerous death threats,
according to his collegues.
   Boulouque's lawyer, Francois Sarda, denied reports the suicide
was prompted by family problems. The French press claimed he had an
argument with his wife while attending an art opening hours before
his death.
   In a statement, Sarda said Boulouque was the victim of unjust
accusations. Boulouque ``lived with a silent revolt inside him that
undoubtedly wore on his nerves,'' the lawyer said.
   Boulouque also was the investigating judge in the case of
convicted Lebanese terrorist Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, who is
serving a life term for killing an American military attache in
Paris.
   Boulouque recently took on the investigation of a French arm of
the Basque terrorist group ETA.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Motion To Dismiss Charges Against Navajo Chairman's
Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tribal judge denied a motion today
to dismiss charges against the son of suspended Navajo Chairman
Peter MacDonald to force him to testify against his father.
   Special prosecutors asked Judge Robert Yazzie of tribal District
Court on Wednesday to dismiss the single conspiracy count against
Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr. and to compel him to testify.
   Yazzie denied the motion without explanation this morning and
resumed the trial, which had been temporarily halted while he
studied the prosecution request.
   The two are on trial on bribery, fraud and conspiracy charges
stemming from the tribe's 1987 purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch
for $33.4 million, just hours after it had been sold to a third
party for $26.25 million.
   The elder MacDonald is charged with single counts of bribery,
fraud and conspiracy and 10 ethics violations. The single
conspiracy count is the only charge facing his son.
   Though he turned down the prosecution today in the motion
regarding the younger MacDonald, Yazzie had granted a prosecution
motion Wednesday to dismiss election-fraud charges against
suspended Vice Chairman Johnny Thompson, a defendant in an upcoming
trial. The dismissal of charges is in exchange for Thompson's
testimony against MacDonald both in the current Big Boquillas trial
and the election-fraud trial set for next month.
   MacDonald and Thompson were suspended by the tribal council in
February 1989 after a U.S. Senate committee heard testimony in
Washington from Rocky MacDonald and others that the elder MacDonald
accepted cash payments and other favors from people doing business
with the tribe.
   The MacDonalds were convicted on Oct. 17 in tribal court of
bribery, conspiracy and ethics violations in October. That trial
involved allegations that the elder MacDonald took bribes and
kickbacks from businessmen operating on the reservation.
   The elder MacDonald is also to stand trial Jan. 16 on election
fraud charges. Until the charges against Thompson were dropped
Wednesday, he had faced more than 60 counts in that case stemming
from the tribe's 1986 election.

   Vandals painted Nazi slogans and swastikas on the
wall of a Jewish cemetery in eastern Berlin, police said Thursday.
   No suspects have been detained in the case, which is still under
investigation. However, the desecration of Jewish cemeteries in the
past has often been traced to neo-Nazi groups.
   The Jewish community in eastern Berlin said the incident
Wednesday night was one of several recent anti-Semitic acts at the
cemetery in the Weissensee district of the city.
   Police said the Nazi slogans and symbols, including the
swastika, had been removed by Thursday afternoon.
   During the summer, three people were arrested in
Baden-Wuerttemberg state for overturning tombstones and painting
Nazi symbols at several Jewish cemeteries.
   The Weissensee area in Berlin is the site of one of the largest
Jewish cemeteries in central Europe. It was recently visited by
German President Richard von Weizsaecker.
   Among the prominent Jews buried there are journalist Theodor
Wolff and publisher Samuel Fischer.

<HEAD>Hungary to Return Church Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decided to return
church property that was confiscated by Communists starting in
1948, the state news agency MTI reported Thursday.
   The draft bill to return schools, hospitals and cultural
establishments will be presented to Parliament for final approval
in the near future.
   Large estates formerly owned by the churches are expressly not
included in the plan, MTI said.
   Implementation of the decision will be spread over a 10-year
period.
   Churches have made applications for the return of about 800
facilities throughout the country, said Laszlo Szalay of the
Ministry of Education and Culture. He was quoted by the daily Mai
Nap.
   Eventually, tens of thousands of institutions might be affected,
he said.
   Most Hungarians are Roman Catholic, but there are Lutherans and
Calvinists as well.
   Pope John Paul II is scheduled to visit Hungary next summer.
   Hungary, like other countries in what used to be the East bloc,
threw out its Communist leaders and elected a center-right
government in the spring.
   Its decision to open its border with Austria last year
encouraged a wave of East Germans to flee their country through
Hungary, and some people believe that was the catalyst for the
Eastern European revolutions.

   A 45-year-old parolee was convicted this
morning of 10 counts of murder for the serial slayings of
Rochester-area women during the past two ears.
   The Monroe County Court jury deliberated for about 4{ hours
Wednesday and for about an hour this mturning with
the guilty verdicts against Arthur Shawcross.
   Shawcross, 45, faces up to lifeorning before re imprisonment on each
count when
he is sentenced Feb. 1. Jurors rejected defense contentions that he
was legally insane when he killed 10 women between March 1988 and
January 1990.
   At the time of the serial slayings, Shawcross was on parole
after serving 15 years in prison for the 1972 stranglings of two
children in Watertown.
   He was arrested Jan. 4, a day after state police spotted him
near the frozen body of one of the victims.
   After the jury's decision was announced, prosecutor Charles
Siragusa was hugged by victims' relatives and the mother of Karen
Ann Hill, a girl Shawcross killed in 1972.
   ``I'm just glad the verdict was murder,'' said Pattie Trippi,
sister of victim Darlene Trippi. ``That's jimed the

   Drizpaul and Parker had access to classified information, but
investigators disputed the claim of espionage as a motive.

   Fulltime top executives at trade and
professional associations that lobby in Washington earned an
average of $202,767 last year, with the Motion Picture
Association's Jack Valenti topping the list at $672,590, a magazine
said Thursday.
   Valenti, who became president of the association after a stint
as a White House aide in the Johnson administration, was the
highest paid executive in a survey of major trade and professional
associations and interest groups by the magazine National Journal.
   Like many other executives in the survey, Valenti is chief
Washington lobbyist for the people he represents.
   Highest paid among interest groups was Horace Deets, executive
director of the American Association of Retired Persons, who earned
$220,000.
   The magazine said its survey was based primarily on Internal
Revenue Service records. It said the figures given excluded
benefits and expense allowances.
   They showed that the average top salary was $146,659 at labor
unions, $133,336 at research organizations and $102,254 at interest
groups.
   Ranking second to Valenti in pay was James H. Sammons, executive
vice president of the American Medical Association, who earned
$623,167. He has since been replaced by James S. Todd, who makes
$411,000.
   Jason S. Berman, a former congressional aide who is president of
the Recording Industry Association of America, was third at
$551,731.
   Next in order were Edward I. O'Brien, Securities Industry
Association, $511,159; Robert E. Vagley, American Insurance
Association, $474,122; former Sen. Richard S. Schweiker, R-Pa.,
American Council of Life Insurance, $473,937; Charles J. DiBona,
American Petroleum Institute, $468,408; Donald G. Ogilvie, American
Bankers Association, $450,932; former Agriculture Department
official John M. Damgard, Futures Industry Association, $407,500,
and David Silver, Investment Company Institute, $404,652.
   Among executives of research organizations, Edwin J. Feulner
Jr., president of the Heritage Foundation, was in first place at
$258,721. After him was Christopher C. DeMuth, president of the
American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, at
$220,000.
   The highest paid labor executive was William J. McCarthy,
president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, at
$283,145. President Henry Duffy of the Air Line Pilots Association
was close behind at $256,424.
   Ranking behind Deets among heads of interest groups, those that
do not represent a specific industry, were Jay D. Hair, who earned
$188,847 as president of the National Wildlife Federation, and Faye
Wattleton, who was paid $184,000 as president of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America Inc.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said today
his nation wants peace but that it will gladly wage war rather than
permit foreign domination of Arab oil or land, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported.
   ``We want peace, endeavor to achieve it, and work to reach a
point where no one of us brandishes his sword against the other.
But if the enemies want to push affairs to a military duel, then by
God's help we would win and would walk over their corpses and tread
on their heads,'' INA quoted Saddam as saying.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Saddam told his Cabinet
that Iraq's enemies do not want it to remain an economic, military
or political power because they believe it is a danger they should
not permit in the region.
   ``The battle against us did not start in August ... the
conspiracy began long before that date because of our pan-Arab
stand, our position on Palestine and our demand that it be returned
to its people,'' INA quoted him as saying.
   Referring to the U.S.-led multinational forces in Saudi Arabia,
Saddam said: ``If God wanted us to have the honor of waging this
battle, then let it be so that all this rot in the Arab homeland
would be removed.''
   In an effort to divide the anti-Iraq coaliton - which includes
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria - Saddam has repeatedly tried to link
the gulf crisis with the Palestinians' fight for a homeland in
territories occupied by Israel.
   The Bush administration has suggested that if the multinational
forces move to liberate Kuwait they may also destroy Iraq's
stockpiles of chemical weapons and facilities that may one day give
it the ability to build nuclear weapons.

<TEXT>
   It's the winter rice harvest, and the
talk in the paddy fields and marketplaces is about the crop - and,
like everywhere else in Bangladesh, politics.
   Farmers rake rice grains with their feet across a cement slab to
dry in the warm sun. The monsoon rainfall was less than usual this
summer, but at least there was no drought, flood, cyclone, tidal
wave or serious tornado.
   The mood is buoyant for another reason, too. When President
Hussain Muhammad Ershad resigned on Dec. 6, villagers marched
through the marketplace in celebration. It brought to a close
Ershad's rigidly authoritarian eight-year rule.
   ``We are happy he's gone. Maybe now democracy will come,'' said
Kazi Azimullah, a student who had come home to work on his father's
farm.
   But down the road in a place called Ershad Village, the factory
workers and rickshaw pullers felt no joy at the downfall of their
patron.
   Ershadnagar, as it is called in Bengali, is a complex of brick
houses with tin roofs, outdoor plumbing and no electricity. The
average daily wage is $1.35, but the people here say they have much
to be grateful for. As poor as it is, it's a vast improvement from
their native hamlets.
   ``Ershad has been good for us. If another government comes along
and builds three-story buildings, we would support it,'' said
shopkeeper Mohammad Malik. ``But we're worried the building may
stop.'' Ershadnagar, with 1,000 permanent homes and 20,000 people,
is only one-third built.
   Ershad, a former general who seized power in 1982, bowed to a
persistent seven-week campaign of often violent street
demonstrations. The people's uprising, led by university students,
demanded that he quit and hand over power to a caretaker government
which would prepare for free elections.
   Opposition parties accused him of fraud in each of the three
elections held during his rule. They also alleged that he or his
wife salted away millions of dollars from kickbacks on government
contracts.
   On Wednesday, Ershad was arrested and confined to a house in
Dhaka's diplomatic enclave. The house, vacated several months ago,
had been the residence of British high commissioners, or
ambassadors, for six years. Ershad is expected to be tried by
special tribunals on charges of corruption and abuse of power.
   Now Bangladesh is groping for a new political order. Since
independence from Pakistan in 1971, it has been governed by
strongmen or military-installed leaders.
   It has had nine presidents but has never had a transition of
power through the ballot box. Its two strongest presidents, Sheik
Mujibar Rahman and Gen. Ziaur Rahman, were assassinated.
   Bangladesh boasts a tradition of elections but not of democracy.
The 1986 parliamentary election in Kuniya, a village of 4,000
people 20 miles from Dhaka, was typical.
   ``Only 30 percent could vote. When the others went to the
polling station they saw that their votes had already been cast for
them,'' said Azimullah, the farmer's son.
   The country has a profusion of political parties, which are
roughly grouped into three major alliances. The two dominant
parties are divided by personal jealousies and historic rivalries
more than by policies.
   They are led by Sheik Hasina, who inherited leadership of the
Awami League from her father, and Khaleda Zia, who took over her
dead husband's Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The two women led the
protest movement against Ershad. They are skilled in opposition
politics and mustering street crowds, but neither has experience in
government.
   ``They must establish a clean and honest administration, and it
must be done from the top,'' said Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed, a Supreme
Court attorney in Dhaka.
   But that won't be easy. ``There is something that compels our
political leaders toward authoritarianism, and the potential for
graft and corruption is difficult to resist,'' he said.
   The challenge for the next government is monumental. Desperately
poor, the people are regularly buffeted by natural disasters in a
country which can barely feed itself during good years like this
one.
   ``Bangladesh is everybody's basket case,'' said a diplomat
involved in aid projects here. It has 110 million people crammed
into a country the size of Wisconsin, with an average per capita
income of $170 a year.
   Four out of five people live below the poverty line, meaning
they don't have enough to eat. The literacy rate is officially 23
percent, but foreign diplomats believe the rate is much lower.
Hasina, the opposition leader, says barely 15 percent of the people
can write their own names.
   Half of the national budget, or $1.6 billion a year, comes from
grants and loans by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank,
Japan and smaller donors. The U.S. contribution is about $150
million annually.
   Even before the gulf crisis jacked up oil prices and deprived
Bangladesh of one of its main sources of hard currency, workers'
remittances, the country's foreign currency reserves had fallen to
a bare $450 million, just enough to cover six weeks imports.
   Despite the gloomy prospects, there is a new hope in the
country, even among the professionals and businessmen who benefited
from the loose controls and easy profits.
   ``For the first time we are thinking about our collective
virtues and not about our collective sins,'' said A.Z.M.
Enayetullah Khan, a publisher and former ambassador.

   Horatio Nelson, the legendary
British admiral who smashed Napoleon Bonaparte's naval might nearly
two centuries ago, would be right at home in the Saudi desert,
directing the tanks that are the treaded ships of modern warfare.
   ``It's a lot like ships at sea,'' said Capt. Sean MacFarland of
the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment headquartered at Fort Bliss,
Texas. ``There's no place you can hide. You have to rely on speed
and firepower.''
   There are no mountains, hills, rivers, valleys or other features
to break up the desert terrain, where a burgeoning U.S.-led
multinational force is squaring off against Iraq.
   The big tanks become like battleships dispersed in formation.
Some use the naval tactics of blocking, maneuvering and flank
assaults.
   Even some of the equipment is maritime.
   One of the ways the army finds its way around the desert is
Loran, or Long-Range Navigation, normally used to fix the position
of a ship or aircraft with electronic pulses sent out by two radio

<HEAD>Critics Say Natives Deserve More From Alaska University System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROSANNE PAGANO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Alaska regent Eric Forrer
decided the system was failing Eskimo, Indian and Aleut students,
and he wanted more from his fellow board members than just more
money.
   He wanted a promise that academia - a pejorative word when
Forrer uses it - would make more than an occasional field trip to
rural villages. He wanted a definition of classroom achievement
that didn't always mean graduating with a four-year degree.
   At an August meeting Forrer, a self-employed carpenter from
Juneau, told the board about a collection of art done 20 years ago
by his parent's grade-school students from the village of Eek, on
the Kuskokwim River in western Alaska.
   ``This art ... leads me to one of the first axioms of native
education,'' he told the board, ``and that is that the standards
and expectations for native students should reflect their abilities
- and these are precisely and exactly the abilities of everybody
nationwide.''
   The regents unanimously approved Forrer's request for $274,500
for a Fairbanks-based program aimed at easing promising high
schoolers from rural Alaska into university life.
   The regents also rededicated the university to making native
education one of its highest priorities. The board asked for a
consolidated budget for native programs and staff time dedicated to
the issue.
   The university has worked for decades setting up tutoring,
counseling and vocational programs so that rural students - most of
them member of Alaska's three major native groups - may make the
most of their talents.
   Some of those programs, like the Rural Alaska Honors Institute
that Forrer won extra funding for, are reporting some success.
According to university figures, three-fourths of students who
attended the institute continued their education after high school.
   Three rural campuses linked to the University of Alaska
Fairbanks specialize in offering rural students certificate
programs with a two-year degree.
   And at the University of Alaska Anchorage campus, natives are
expected to soon make up a slight majority of students enrolled in
the four-year school of nursing.
   But in the meantime, campus activists like 36-year-old Mary F.
Reeve say attracting more native students isn't the answer when
university figures show the native dropout rate is high.
   ``Recruitment is inappropriate until we can better serve the
students we currently (have),'' said Reeve.
   Reeve, a Yupik Eskimo from the southwest Alaska village of
Dillingham, is a University of Alaska Anchorage student appointed
to the board of regents in October.
   She says the needs of native students are losing out as the
university lives within a tighter state budget.
   ``Native student enrollment at (the Anchorage campus) increased
17 percent during the fall semester - yet services to these
students have been diminished,'' Reeve said.
   Among losses are layoffs of native work-study students and no
addition to the one-person native guidance counselor staff, she
said.
   At the Kuskokwim campus in Bethel, director LaMont E. Albertson
says he's having good results with a three-week initiation program
that helps students - 90 percent of them Yupik Eskimo - make
friends fast and get to know their teachers as people.
   ``They learn we all have the same concerns in life, that we're
not a Caucasian god with all the answers,'' Anderson said.
   Still, Albertson says, students who complete a two-year degree
at the campus are barred from going anywhere other than
UA-Fairbanks if they want more schooling.
   ``Our students have many more relatives in Anchorage than in
Fairbanks. If we already know that having those contacts close by
helps rural students, then we should get off our academic high
horse and let them transfer directly to UAA or UAF - no questions
asked.''
   System-wide, natives continue to account for just a fraction of
all students attaining degrees.
   In 1989, of 29,963 degrees awarded at Anchorage, Fairbanks and
the University of Alaska Southeast combined, 2,414 went to natives.
   That is considerable improvement, though, considering that 12
years ago there were 175 graduates with four-year-degrees from
Fairbanks - just six of them Alaska natives.

<HEAD>Riot in Mexican Town Leaves at Least 3 Dead, 50 Injured</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Riot police and members of an opposition
political party clashed in a town southeast of Mexico City, leaving
at least three people dead and 50 injured, authorities said today.
   The clash on Wednesday followed four weeks of opposition
protests that accused the long-governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party of fraud in elections Nov. 11 in Mexico state.
   Each side blamed the other for starting the disturbance, in
which two of the three killed were police.
   ``I think this was planned by the state government to give us a
violent image,'' Herberto Castillo, director of the left-leaning
opposition Revolutionary Democratic Party, said in a telephone
interview.
   State Gov. Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza said: ``It is condemnable
that the Revolutionary Democratic Party tried to resolve its
political differences in a useless manner.''
   At least 40 of the 50 injured people were police, said Cesar
Silva, a spokesman for the state that rings Mexico City, the
capital. Silva said four farm workers were being held on weapons
charges.
   The showdown took place when about 3,000 people gathered in
front of the City Hall 75 miles southeast of Mexico City to protest
alleged fraud.
   Official results gave City Hall to the governing party by a
2-to-1 margin, but the opposition rejected the results, saying
Tejupilco always has favored the Revolutionary Democrats.
   Opposition rightists and leftists have often accused the
governing party of resorting to fraud to maintain its 61-year-old
old on power.
   Opposition members had demonstrated outside City Hall since Nov.
14 to protest the results. They gathered on Wednesday to listen to
Castillo.
   ``Just when I began to speak the police attacked the women,''
Castillo said, accusing the police of using guns and tear gas.
   A state communique said the police only acted when the
demonstrators tried to take over the city hall by force. ``Members
of the PRD fired powerful weapons at the front of the public
building,'' the statement said.
   Castillo denied the opposition party tried to take over the
building. Photos published today in the capital showed many of the
peasants with guns.
   There were conflicting reports as to whether the police had
guns.

   After three months without adequate food or water in the
besieged U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and
his staff left Baghdad for home today on a chartered flight that
reportedly carried 25 other Americans.
   Officials said the last five U.S. diplomats from Kuwait were
among 94 passengers on an Iraqi Airways flight to Frankfurt,
Germany. It was said to be the last charter plane carrying
foreigners from Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   Howell, Barbara Bodine, the deputy chief of mission in Kuwait,
and three other American diplomats earlier landed in Baghdad aboard
a U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways plane from Kuwait. They were whisked
through the departure lounge at Baghdad's Saddam International
Airport and were not available for comment.
   ``They are in good spirits and good shape and ready to get back
to the States,'' a U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad said in on
condition of anonymity.
   He said the compound in Kuwait was left unstaffed but open and
that Iraqi authorities had pledged it would not be disturbed.
   The departure of the American diplomats from Kuwait ended a
four-month diplomatic standoff between the United States and Iraq.
Howell and his colleagues at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait had defied
Iraqi orders to close in August. Gradually, all foreigners but the
British and Americans removed their diplomats as Iraq cut off
supplies and posted soldiers outside the compounds.
   The trapped U.S. diplomats subsisted for three months on canned
tuna and boiled water from the embassy's swimming pool, but were
allowed emergency supplies in recent weeks. Britain announced
Wednesday that its last embassy employees would leave within the
week.
   In other developments today:
   -Saddam Hussein today repeated his often state view that his
nation wants peace but that it will gladly wage war rather than
permit foreign domination of Arab oil or land, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported.
   ``We want peace, endeavor to achieve it, and work to reach a
point where no one of us brandishes his sword against the other.
But if the enemies want to push affairs to a military duel, then by
God's help we would win and would walk over their corpses and tread
on their heads,'' INA quoted Saddam as saying.
   -In another INA report Iraq accused the United States of lying
about the timing of talks in Baghdad and Washington. It said Iraq
had rejected dates proposed by the United States for Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz's trip to Washington and a visit by Secretary
of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad.
   The U.S. State Department says Iraq's insistence on a Jan. 12
date for Baker's visit is too close to the Jan. 15 deadline a U.N.
resolution has set for Iraq to relinquish Kuwait or face possible
attack. Washington said Aziz was scheduled to meet President Bush
on Monday but that the meeting will not take place unless a date
has been set for Baker's visit.
   -Japan's parliament approved $1 billion to help support
multinational forces deployed against Iraq - the final portion of
$2 billion already pledged by Tokyo. In all, Japan has pledged $4
billion for efforts to solve the gulf crisis - $2 billion for the
multinational forces and $2 billion in aid for nations suffering
from the international embargo against Iraq. Today's vote came two
days after the Pentagon accused Japan of being slow to send the
funds.
   -OPEC ministers in Vienna endorsed maintaining high crude
production to ease any oil shortages caused by the gulf crisis, and
pledged to sharply reduce their output once it is resolved. One oil
minister said the statement wrapping up the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting should ``send a signal (that
people) need to relax in a time of worry.''
   -In diplomatic moves, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze arrived in Turkey for two days of discussions that
will center on the gulf crisis. Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid
arrived in Iran on the third leg of a new Arab peace initiative.
Bendjedid met with Saddam on Wednesday and Jordan's King Hussein
the day before, but Arab diplomats said he apparently canceled a
stop in Saudi Arabia, indicating his initiative was in trouble.
   U.S. Embassy officials at the Baghdad airport said that among
the 94 people leaving on the U.S.-charter were 30 Americans,
including three members of the Baghdad embassy staff; 25 Britons,
including three Baghdad embassy personnel; 16 Canadians; nine
Japanese; and an unspecified number of Italians, Norwegians, Irish
and other nationalities.
   Officials in Baghdad said all other foreigners who missed the
charter could leave later by regular flights or by ground
transportation.
   U.S. officials said the departure of the Americans today left
just one American who had been held hostage at a strategic site. He
was identified as Gary O'Conner of Humble, Texas. Officials said he
would go to Basra, Iraq, to finalize his business and leave Iraq at
a later date.
   The charter flight left as part of Iraq's blanket hostage
release announced one week ago. Iraq had barred thousands of
foreigners from travel after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. It held
hundreds of them - mostly Americans, Britons and Japanese - at
strategic sites to deter a feared attack by U.S.-led forces sent to
the region in response to the invasion.
   Before today's flight, about 188 Americans have been evacuated
from Iraq and Kuwait over the last week. U.S. officials estimate
that about 500 Americans - most of them children with dual
citizenship - are remaining.

<NOTE>Eds: Subs 1st and 12th grafs to specific controversial holiday

   Episcopalians are caught up in agonizing debate
over plans to hold their 1991 national convention in Arizona now
that the state's voters have rejected a paid holiday honoring
Martin Luther King Jr.
   Even if the site remains the same, as now seems likely, leaders
say it will be a different sort of convention, shorn of celebrative
frills and highlighting racial justice.
   The debate has become so emotionally strained that the Episcopal
Church's presiding bishop, the Most Rev. Edmond Lee Browning, has
called a special executive council meeting for Jan. 5 to consider
ways to trim down the affair.
   After weeks of debate, contentious conference calls and
consultations with church members, especially blacks, Browning said
he was convinced the church must adhere to its scheduled meeting
place in Phoenix July 10-20.
   ``I believe that this rougher road is the one that the church is
meant to walk,'' he said. He has authority to determine the site,
with advice and consent of the executive council of the 2.5
million-member denomination.
   The convention won't be ``business as usual,'' Browning said,
suggesting that it could be shortened and modified and also that it
could offer a powerful witness in Arizona to racial equality.
   At his invitation, South Africa's Anglican archbishop, the Rev.
Desmond Tutu, widely honored for his struggles against racism,
agreed to lead a rally to open the convention.
   Browning's comments haven't quieted the arguing, although the
denomination has avoided a racial split. Whites and blacks are on
both sides of the debate.
   Twelve of the 99 domestic Episcopal dioceses - and scores of
local congregations - have formally urged that the triennial
governing convention either be canceled or held somewhere else.
   Warnings have come that some elected representatives might
refuse to take part if the meeting stays in Phoenix. The
Washington, D.C., diocesan council, for example, recommended its
representatives not participate if it's in Arizona.
   In urging another site, the Diocese of Atlanta, the birthplace
of King, offered to play host to the convention, which usually
draws more than 10,000 church people.
   The furor broke out after Arizona voters in a Nov. 6 referendum
narrowly defeated a proposed state paid holiday honoring the slain
civil rights leader.
   Although months of advance planning already had been made for
the Episcopalians' once-in-three-years convention, calls quickly
arose for a switch in plans.
   Holding the convention in Phoenix ``and the economic benefits
associated with it'' would be ``an inappropriate witness'' to the
church's stand for racial equality, the New York diocesan council
declared.
   Ohio became a virtual intrastate battleground. The Ohio diocesan
convention, based in Cleveland, called for a new site, but the
southern Ohio diocese, based in Cincinnati, urged sticking with
Phoenix.
   Southern Ohio Bishop Herbert Thompson, a black, said that it was
important to go to Phoenix to show support for racial equality and
that it would be costly and irresponsible to abandon numerous
contracts made for the convention.
   He said pulling out would imply abandoning Arizona blacks and
``we need to stand with them at this time'' to ``overcome this
injustice and prejudice.''
   But Ohio's Suffragan Bishop Arthur Williams Jr., also black,
said he didn't see how the convention could help much since ``we
will spend most of the 20 days in an air-conditioned hall ... or
eating and sleeping.''
   Ohio Bishop James R. Moodey, a white, said some money might have
to be paid to cancel advance guarantees, ``but moral leadership,
not money, should guide our decision.''
   Other diocesan bodies calling for moving the meeting included
the Rio Grande Diocese, based in Albuquerque, N.M., which includes
southwestern Texas, and the New England province, which has seven
dioceses.
   Many secular and some auxiliary Episcopal organizations scrapped
plans for Arizona meetings after the defeat of the King holiday.
The commissioner of the National Football League said he will
recommend the 1993 Super Bowl be moved from Phoenix.
   ``We do not have that choice,'' Browning said. ``We are in this
for the long haul. We cannot turn our backs on the injustices done
to minorities ...''
   He said many Arizonans have worked hard to overcome prejudice
and need support. He urged that ``we stand with them and together
make a vigorous witness to the dignity of all God's people.''
   Browning said the church's executive council would discuss ways
to scale down the convention rather than move it during the special
meeting next month in Elizabeth, N.J. But that question conceivably
could be opened by the 40-member council.
   Several church leaders who have met with Browning have suggested
the convention should make an ``economic witness'' such as
particularly patronizing minority-owned businesses.

   A federal judge today refused to order
President Bush to seek permission from Congress before any attack
on Iraqi forces in the Persian Gulf but reaffirmed the power of
lawmakers to declare war.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene denied a request by 54
Democratic members of Congress for an injunction to force the
president to seek a declaration of war before launching an attack
on Iraqi troops in Kuwait.
   But the judge said that in principle, the president must seek
such authorization from Congress. But he said the issue was not
ripe for decision because Bush ``has not shown a commitment to a
definitive course of action.''
   The judge noted that Congress had not debated the issue of
whether to use military force to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
   Greene noted that only about 10 percent of Congress had asked
for an injunction against the president. ``It would hardly do to
have the court, in effect, force a choice upon the Congress ... to
the effect that, unless the rest of the Congress votes in favor of
declaration of war, the president, and the several hundred thousand
troops he has dispatched to the Saudi Arabian desert, must be
immobilized,'' Greene said.
   ``Unless Congress as a whole, or by a majority, is heard from,
the controversy here cannot be deemed ripe,'' Greene said. ``It is
only (ripe) if the majority of the Congress seeks relief from an
infringement on its constitutional war-declaration power that it
may be entitled to receive it.''
   Greene's decision came as another federal judge, Royce C.
Lamberth, dismissed a lawsuit by an Army National Guard reservist
seeking his return from the Persian Gulf until Bush gets
congressional authorization.
   Unlike Greene, Lamberth held that courts cannot decide the issue
of whether Bush must seek congressional permission to wage war
because it is essentially a political question outside the province
of the judiciary.
   Lamberth dismissed the lawsuit by Sgt. Michael R. Ange, a
student and former policeman from North Carolina who was sent to
Saudi Arabia last month when his National Guard unit was activated.
   Greene, however, held that courts could rule on whether a war
was so imminent that the president was required under the
Constitution to seek a declaration of war from Congress before
launching an attack.
   ``The court has no hesitation in concluding that an offensive
entry into Iraq by several hundred thousand United States
servicemen ... could be described as a `war' within the meaning of
Article I, Section 8, Clause ll of the Constitution.''
   ``The court is not prepared to read out of the Constitution the
clause granting to the Congress, and to it alone, the authority `to
declare war,'' he said.
   Michael Ratner, an attorney for the Center for Constitutional
Rights, which brought both cases, said he was pleased by Greene's
finding that Congress has the sole power to declare war.
   ``I would have rather won the case in terms of a legal win, but
to have a federal judge way that to have an offensive war against
Iraq is not in the president's power is an important decision, a
ringing affirmation of the Constitution.''
   ``I think it's great that he basically affirmed Congress's power
to be the body that gets us into a war,'' Ratner said. ``It's
basically telling the president he can't do what he is going to do
without getting Congress to agree beforehand.''
   But the lawyer said he expected the center would appeal both
Greene's and Lamberth's decisions to the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Down in Another Sign of Weak Holiday Buying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales declined 0.1 percent last month,
the government said Thursday in a report analysts said pointed to a
bleak holiday shopping season.
   ``I'm looking for a gloomy Christmas,'' said economist David
Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York securities dealer.
``The consumer has become extremely selective, buying practical
gifts such as clothing, and waiting for a bargain even on those.''
   The report ``implies that consumers are being very cautious,''
agreed Sung Won Sohn, an economist with the Norwest Corp. in
Minneapolis. ``People are not buying postponable goods.''
   Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $151.6 billion, down from
$151.8 billion in October and the first decline since a 0.1 percent
drop in May, the Commerce Department reported.
   Economist Rosalind Wells of the National Retail Federation in
New York said she has not seen much reason to expect the Christmas
shopping pace to pick up soon.
   Analysts said retail activity would have been even more sluggish
except for widespread promotions and other incentives to lure
shoppers. While markdowns might prop up sales in one month, they
tend to depress them in following months.
   ``They're borrowing sales from the future,'' Sohn explained.
   Sales of durable goods - usually expensive products expected to
last more than three years - fell 1.4 percent after rising 0.6
percent in October.
   Automobile sales plummeted 1.3 percent, reversing a 1.4 percent
October increase that some analysts said had come largely from
fleet sales.
   Excluding automobiles, sales inched up 0.2 percent last month.
   While purchases of furniture and other home furnishings rose 0.3
percent, sales of building materials fell 2.6 percent.
   Although purchases of non-durable goods increased 0.5 percent,
general merchandise and department store sales dropped 0.5 percent.
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group in
Washington, said general merchandise sales are a good barometer of
consumer sentiment ``and it's telling us that it's weak.''
   ``It's interesting that department store sales for the last
three months over year-ago levels are up less than 2.0 percent,''
she said. ``If it's adjusted for inflation, it's down for the year
and that's ominous.''
   The sluggishness was seen earlier when the Labor Department
reported the seasonally adjusted loss of 70,000 retail jobs in
November because general merchandise stores were falling short on
their normal seasonal hirings.
   Gains were recorded in sales at grocery stores, up 0.5 percent;
apparel stores, 0.8 percent; restaurants and bars, 0.4 percent, and
drug stores, 0.2 percent.
   Gasoline station sales, which have been driven up by rising oil
prices following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, slowed to a 0.7
percent increase in November. They had risen 2.6 percent in October
and 5.6 percent in September.

   Medic Alert launched a massive program
Thursday to warn 23,000 heart valve recipients in the United States
and Canada about a rare but often fatal defect of an implanted
heart valve.
   Anyone who received a Bjkork-Shiley 60-degree convexo-concave
heart valve is encouraged to call the toll-free hotline for
information about their valve implant, as well as an identification
card and a bracelet or neck chain identifying them as valve
recipients.
   ``This is not a recall,'' said Dr. Roger Sachs, Shiley's medical
director.
   He said physicians consulted by the company maintain that the
risk of reimplantation is much higher than the risk of valve
failure.
   Medic Alert, best known its bracelets worn to identify people
with medical conditions in case of an emergency, has joined the
valve manufacturer, Pfizer Inc., in an unprecedented program to
locate patients who have the valve.
   Letters will be sent through doctors to patients, or directly if
their doctors can't be located, to alert them to signs of possible
valve failure and to tell them where to get treatment if necessary.
   Sachs said any sudden change in a patient's condition, such as
shortness of breath or weakness, should be investigated.
   Valve fractures have occurred in about seven of every 10,000
patients per year according to the Food and Drug Administration.
   The valve was implanted in about 82,000 people worldwide between
1979 and November 1986, when it was pulled from the market. About
295 fractures of the valve were reported to the FDA, with 178
deaths resulting.
   The company estimates that 23,000 recipients are still alive in
the United States and Canada.
   The toll-free number to call for information is 1-800-245-1492.

   Most state governments will have to cut
budgets or raise taxes next year to balance their books, according
to a report released Thursday.
   A slumping economy has reduced state revenue as spending for
Medicaid, prisons and education has continued to grow, said the
survey of leading state lawmakers from across the country.
   The northeastern states are in the worst financial shape, but
legislative leaders anticipate budget austerity measures in
two-thirds of all states, said the survey conducted by the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
   The economic crunch ``is as serious as it was in 1982'' and the
slide seems ``to be progressing at a faster rate'' than in the
early '80s, Maine House Speaker John Martin told reporters.
   Many of the states must walk the budget tightrope in the next
six months because their fiscal year ends in June, said Martin, a
Democrat who is the new president of the conference, which is
meeting this week in Washington.
   He predicted that it will be about 18 months before state
finances stabilize.
   Revenues in 25 states are more than 1 percent below the budgeted
level for fiscal 1991, the survey found.
   Contributing to the states' woes are federally mandated changes
in programs such as Medicaid, with the states paying the bill for
the revisions.
   ``Congress has chosen to transfer the national budget problem to
state governments,'' the survey stated.
   Federal tax increases on gasoline, tobacco and liquor will cost
the states $3.5 billion in revenue over the next five years, the
survey projected, with the federal increases cutting into
consumption.
   Each of the six New England states is a candidate for tax
increases, the legislative leaders reported.
   Connecticut's accumulated deficit at the end of fiscal 1992 will
equal 30 percent of the general fund, according to some estimates.
New York enacted a $1.25 billion tax increase last year and a
record $1.8 billion tax boost earlier this year, but still faces a
massive revenue shortfall.
   The New York Legislature is preparing to approve a
budget-cutting plan to close a projected $1 billion deficit.
   Due to financial problems, the leading candidates for tax
increases include Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina,
California and Florida, the legislative leaders said.
   In the survey, the leaders said that:
   -California faces a revenue shortfall that may reach $1 billion
in fiscal 1991, with a shortfall of up to $5.9 billion the
following year.
   -Despite substantial tax increases last year, Florida is
struggling with a mounting budget shortfall.
   -Pennsylvania faces a $1.5 billion shortfall. Gov. Robert P.
Casey opposes tax increases and recommends cuts in spending to
solve the problem.
   Other top-priority issues in state legislatures next year will
be tax reform, education, the environment and reapportionment,
according to the survey.
   Abortion, a top concern of state legislators in the past, is not
a priority item this year, according to the survey.

   Weary shoppers ending another day of scouring
stores for food said Thursday they welcomed economic aid from the
United States and did not feel ashamed, because it wasn't a
handout.
   ``What humiliation?'' said Nikolai Kropotov as he bundled up
against the chill of the Moscow night. ``No one is humiliated.''
   The Bush administration has promised the Soviet Union up to $1
billion in loan guarantees to buy American wheat, corn and other
farm products to stave off food shortages this winter.
   ``You are selling it quite fairly and we are buying it quite
fairly,'' said Kropotov, 72. ``There is no embarrassment.''
   As he adjusted a cloth sack to secure three loaves bought at
Bread Store No. 150 in western Moscow, Kropotov said he was
confident the food the Soviet government would buy from the United
States would reach the people, despite the current problems in the
nation's supply system.
   Expressing similar confidence was Viktor Rozhkov, 55, who was
waiting in the store while his wife bought bread.
   ``At present, I think the food will make it to the stores, what
with the Interior Ministry, the KGB and the police all controlling
its distribution,'' Rozhkov said.
   He had some mixed feelings about the aid. ``On the one hand we
need help, but on the other, you have to pay for any credit,''
Rozhkov said.
   ``If it was help simply free of charge, it would be
humiliating,'' he said, ``but as it's credit, it's not
humiliating.''
   Asked what kind of goods he would like to see purchased with the
loan guarantees, Rozhkov replied: ``Basic food, canned goods,
sausage, meat products. Nowadays, we have practically nothing.''
   Others questioned on the street said they would like to see more
meat, butter and milk in the stores.
   ``I want to see all those things (that were) freely available in
the shops a year ago,'' said Muscovite Raisa L. Lebedinskaya.
   ``It is very good that our relationships are so close,'' she
said of the current ties with the United States. ``If we receive
the aid and make friends at such a difficult moment, that would be
wonderful.''
   A 68-year-old woman who wanted to be identified only as Katya
said the U.S. aid was only proper, because the Soviet Union had
helped other nations for years.
  ``We have been helping other countries a lot, and that's why
everything has disappeared,'' she said. ``Why should we be
embarrassed now? I don't think it's embarrassing.''
   Apparently referring to the 2,500 metric tons of aid the Soviet
Union has received from abroad in recent weeks, Katya said, ``It's
not only the United States. There's also East Germany, West
Germany, Italy, Switzerland - all are helping.''
   Vasily I. Tarasov, who was hurrying home with a plastic bag in
each hand, viewed the U.S. economic assistance as needed help from
a friend.
   ``We are to blame,'' said Tarasov, 75. ``We allowed it. The
whole nation is to blame, and now the whole nation has to escape
from this.''

<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee is trying to get
an inside view of Charles H. Keating Jr.'s dealings with five
senators by questioning a former top aide of the savings and loan
operator.
   James Grogan, who served as Keating's lobbyist, was believed to
have extensive knowledge about Keating's ties to five senators
under investigation by the panel. And he had extensive contacts
himself with the lawmakers and their staffs.
   Grogan appeared under a grant of immunity before the ethics
panel in second day of closed-door meetings today.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., vice chairman of the panel, emerged
at an afternoon break and said the closed-door questioning could
continue into Friday.
   ``We're still in executive session and there's no reason for me
to think we might not be finishing the executive session
tomorrow,'' Rudman said. ``I can't comment at all on anything he
said.''
   The committee ordered Grogan to testify in hopes he would
provide information from a side that has not yet been heard in 16
days of public hearings - that of Keating, whose Lincoln Savings
and Loan Association collapsed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of
more than $2 billion.
   Rudman said no final decision had been made on public
questioning of Grogan. Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett
said Grogan would undergo public questioning ``at some point,
probably.''
   Grogan was vice president of Lincoln and corporate counsel of
its parent company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix. He was
Keating's main liaison with Capitol Hill and had extensive dealings
with the five senators: Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; John McCain,
R-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; and
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   Keating and his aides have refused to testify, invoking their
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
   Grogan was granted immunity from prosecution based on his
testimony. The committee said it would not provide immunity to
secure the testimony of Keating, who is under federal investigation
and has been indicted on state fraud charges in California.
   Grogan's name has surfaced often during the public hearings. He
arranged for political donations to lawmakers and was point man in
soliciting congressional help for Keating's furious battle with
thrift regulators in an unsuccessful effort to save Irvine,
Calif.-based Lincoln.
   The committee did not decide to compel his testimony until late
in its investigation, however.
   Keating and associates donated $1.3 million to the five senators
and their campaigns and favorite causes. The lawmakers also
intervened with thrift regulators on Lincoln's behalf. The panel is
considering whether the donations and the intervention were
connected.
   Grogan undertook several activities that could spark the
committee's interest. He:
   -Arranged for Keating's contributions to three
voter-registration projects supported by Cranston. Keating donated
$850,000.
   -Set in motion a complaint by Cranston's banking aide to
regulators about their tough enforcement stance against Lincoln. A
career regulator said the complaint delayed the eventual takeover
of Lincoln, although the Cranston staffer, Carolyn D. Jordan,
denied pressuring regulators.
   -Played a role in arranging two crcial meetings with
regulators. One, on April 2, 1987, involved all of the senators
except Riegle; the second, a week later, included all the senators.
   Regulators testified the senators were hostile and had made up
their minds beforehand that Lincoln received unfair treatment.
   -Was told in a memo from Keating to try to get a senior career
regulator fired for his hard-nosed stance against Lincoln.

   Nat Howell, U.S. ambassador to Kuwait, is
coming home a hero, a symbol of America's resistance to a tyrant's
coercion.
   ``He drank the same dirty water, he slept outside with the flies
and the heat,'' said Jack Rinehart, an engineer from Stover, Mo.,
and one of those trapped in the embassy. ``He's a hero, like John
Wayne.''
   W. Nathaniel Howell left Baghdad on Thursday on what was said to
be the last charter plane carrying foreigners from Iraq and
occupied Kuwait.
   Howell was trapped in Kuwait when Iraq invaded the country Aug.
2. For three months, he defied Saddam Hussein's orders to close the
diplomatic compound, which had been surrounded by Iraqi troops.
   The Bush administration this week ordered Howell to evacuate the
embassy, saying he had completed his job by helping U.S. citizens
leave Kuwait.
   The U.S. Embassy in Iraq remains open, but Ambassador April
Glaspie had left the country on vacation three days before the
surprise invasion. The charge d'affaires is running the embassy in
her absence, and the administration says it will remain open and
staffed.
   Howell was packing his bags, closing out a three-year stint in
Kuwait, when Iraqi troops stormed over the border. His wife had
already left for home.
   After Howell refused to leave the embassy, the compound was
deprived of electricity and running water. The eight diplomats and
19 American civilians survived on canned tuna and rice. They
planted gardens and drank the water from the swimming pool.
   The 50-year-old Howell, clad in an orange shirt and Virginia
Tech shorts, helped shovel when the Americans dug a latrine trench
and a well. When they struck water good enough for washing, they
showed their defiance to the Iraqi guards by washing their cars.
   Meanwhile, Howell had to keep underground links open to the
hundreds of Americans in Kuwait who were in hiding, afraid of being
captured and used by the Iraqis as human shields.
   ``His valorous performance was part of the basis for our
continuing hopes of a peaceful solution,'' said Ted Wilkinson,
president of the American Foreign Service Association.
   Wilkinson said ``it was the kind of discipline you'd expect''
from an experienced field officer who was also posted to Egypt
during the 1967 Six-Day War and to Beirut during Lebanon's
mid-1970s civil war.
   Howell left Kuwait only after being assured that all Americans
who wanted to leave the country had been allowed to go.
   Howell and his staff ``performed courageously,'' said White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``They deserve to be taken
out.''
   The ambassador, accompanied by Barbara Bodine, deputy chief of
mission, and three other diplomats, were the last Americans to
evacuate Kuwait City compound. They were to arrive in the United
States on Friday.
   Rinehart, the American engineer, described Howell as ``a
tremendous leader. I told him I trusted my life to him.''
   Howell is reportedly thinking about retiring after 25 years in
the foreign service, but if he decides to stay on, it's likely that
his future will be bright.
   ``He performed with distinction and he should be recognized,''
Wilkinson said.
   Glaspie, the first American woman ambassador to an Arab country,
has been in the United States since the invasion. And in marked
contrast to Howell's triumphant return home, Glaspie has faced
criticism.
   She met Saddam a week before the invasion and, according to
transcripts released by Iraq, praised the Iraqi president for his
``extraordinary efforts'' to rebuild his country. Glaspie reassured
Saddam that the United States took no official position on Iraq's
border dispute with Kuwait.
   The transcripts, never challenged by the State Department,
showed that Glaspie didn't respond directly to Saddam's threats of
terrorism if the United States thwarted his aims. She stressed that
the Bush administration opposed economic sanctions against Iraq.
   Glaspie has since kept a low profile behind State Department
walls, while her second-in-command, charge d'affaires Joseph C.
Wilson IV, has earned accolades for his tireless efforts on behalf
of the American hostages.
   Marshall Wiley, president of the U.S.-Iraq Business Forum and
former ambassador to Oman, said Glaspie ``probably will be unfairly
blamed for not predicting the invasion.''
   But Wiley praised both Glaspie and Howell as highly competent
diplomats, and said Glaspie shouldn't be faulted for reflecting
policy set in Washington.
   ``It was U.S. policy that was mistaken,'' he said.

   Two Salvation Army warehouses holding a
year's worth of donated goods have been destroyed by fire, dealing
the charitable agency a serious blow as Christmas approaches.
   The fire early Wednesday caused more than $150,000 in damage,
fire officials said.
   But Salvation Army Major Charles Gillies said the damage could
greater. The warehouses' stocks of clothing, furniture and
appliances supplied the Salvation Army Thrift Store, the agency's
major source of income.
   From December through February, donations to the thrift store
usually drop and the store relies heavily on its inventory to stay
open, he said.
   Gillies said the store generates $100,000 a year that the
Salvation Army needs to run its programs, including a drug
treatment program, nutrition counseling, assistance for women with
young children, and medical and dental clinics.
   ``It could have been worse, it could have been the store,'' he
said. ``But without the supply we've built up we're going to be
hurting.''
   The warehouses were located behind the thrift store near
downtown. Flames also destroyed a truck.
   The cause of the fire was unknown, said Deputy Fire Marshal Eric
Mohrmann.

   The Democratic Party offered some

which is again looking for a new chairman after William Bennett
changed his mind and turned down the job, citing financial reasons.
   A mock help-wanted ad, offered by the Democratic National

   ``Struggling political party seeks true conservative with
independent wealth or trust fund. Political experience preferred
but not necessary. Must be able to read lips, hips and distinguish
broccoli from asparagus tips. Two year commitment required.
Successful candidate must be able to divert attention away from

apply.''
   Rollins, head of the GOP's congressional campaign arm, and
Buchanan, a conservative columnist, have been critical of Bush's
performance.

<HEAD>Soviet Farm Credit Could Mean Golden Harvest for US Producers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $1 billion in farm credit extended to the
Soviet Union could buy most of the Kansas wheat crop this year. Or
all the corn grown in Ohio. Or all the soybeans produced in
Missouri and Mississippi.
   And you can bet that producers of oats, barley, rice, dairy
products and dozens of other farm goods will be clamoring for
Moscow's attention, too.
   ``Wheat could be the majority of it, I would think,'' said Barry
Jenkins of the National Association of Wheat Growers. ``We may have
something going for us because they need some flour real quick.''
   ``But there's going to be people lined up along with us,'' he
noted.
   Citing the ``tough times, difficult times'' facing the Soviet
people, President Bush announced Wednesday he was waiving, through
June 1991, longstanding trade restrictions and handed the Soviet
Union credit lines of $1 billion for farm products and $300 million
for manufactured goods.
   Ironically, Bush's announcement proved bearish on the market,
because the grain trade had expected the president to give the
Soviets an even higher credit limit.
   Grain futures opened sharply lower Thursday on the Chicago Board
of Trade, and one analyst said the credit package was
disappointing, that traders had expected a figure in the range of
$1.5 billion to $3 billion, the level urged earlier by Sen. Bob
Dole, R-Kan.
   The Agriculture Department will work with Soviet officials to
work out details of the credit package, including schedules for
financing and repayment. The USDA underwrites the loans, which are
made by private lenders under the department's export credit
programs.
   Theoretically, if a four-way split could be arranged, with each
interest group getting a $250 million piece of the pie, it could
mean Soviet purchases of:
   -About 105 million bushels of wheat, based on a recent U.S. farm
price average of $2.39 per bushel.
   -About 114 million bushels of corn at an average farm price of
$2.19 per bushel.
   -About 45 million bushels of soybeans at the recent average U.S.
farm price of $5.51 per bushel.
   -And miscellaneous purchases, with the remaining $250 million,
of rice, oats, barley, dairy products, meat and various processed
food items.
   Actual selling prices to the Soviets would be higher than the
farm prices, however, since transportation charges to move grain
from inland points to port loading facilities must be computed,
too.
   The Soviet Union has been buying large quantities of U.S. grain
since the early 1970s. In recent years, the purchases have been
under long-term agreements that commit both countries to minimum
annual levels.
   In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the Soviets bought 20.3
million metric tons of U.S. grain, including almost 16.5 million
tons of corn and 3.8 million tons of wheat.
   That was the equivalent of 650 million bushels of corn and 140
million bushels of wheat - roughly $1.4 billion worth corn at
today's farm prices and $335 million worth of wheat.
   In all, last year's farm export value to the Soviet Union was
reported by USDA at more than $2.98 billion for all commodities,
down from $3.29 billion in 1988-89.
   Exports are vital to American grain farmers, particularly wheat
producers whose crops far exceed domestic food needs.
   A large harvest this year - more than 2.74 billion bushels - is
adding to the U.S. surplus and holding down market prices.
   Out of the 1990 harvest, only 745 million bushels - about 27
percent of the total wheat output - will be needed as food. Even
with an increase in using wheat to feed livestock, inventories will
increase by the time another harvest is ready in 1991.

<HEAD>Postal Service Preparing Address Correction System for Mass
Mailers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service is organizing a nationwide
computer file to help mass mailers keep accurate addresses, but it
won't contain names and poses no threat to privacy, officials say.
   The USA File, for ``universal system of addressing,'' is being
compiled in district postal offices and will be assembled on a
national basis next year, said Dick Strasser, senior assistant
postmaster general for marketing and customer service.
   The Postal Service is banned under a privacy protection law from
compiling lists of Americans' names and addresses. Strasser
stressed that the USA file will not contain any names, and is
merely a system of assuring that street addresses are correct.
   The impetus for the system is increasing automation in the
postal service, which plans to give mailers discounts for letters
sorted in the order that a letter carrier walks his or her route.
   Mailers will be able to take their mailing lists to a
contractor, which will match it with the USA file and provide them
a list of errors, explained Stresser.
   For example, a if a mailer listed someone at 155 Johnson Street,
the USA file could tell them that there is a North and South
Johnson street in that ZIP code, so they need to check for
themselves which is correct for their mailing.

   After three months under siege in the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait,
Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and his staff arrived in Germany today
aboard an Iraqi airliner carrying 94 people away from the deepening
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways plane landed at Frankfurt
airport, where the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Vernon Walters, led
the welcoming party.
   Officials in Baghdad said the 94 passengers included 30
Americans, 25 Britons, 16 Canadians, nine Japanese, and an
unspecified number of Italians, Norwegians, Irish and other
nationalities.
   The plane, which landed at 7:40 p.m. (1:40 p.m. EST), carried
the last five U.S. diplomats from Kuwait and was said to be the
last charter plane carrying foreigners from Iraq and occupied
Kuwait.
   ``We're very happy to be here. We're delighted that Americans
who wanted to leave did,'' said the 50-year-old Howell, whose gray
hair had grown long during his ordeal and who looked thinner.
   In brief comments to reporters, Howell at first said he had
``closed'' embassy but then caught himself, saying: ``I did not
close the embassy, but I vacated it with the flag flying.''
   Howell declined to speak at length, explaining, ``We haven't had
electriciy and water, hot water, at night for 110 days. So, we're
going to take advantage of that.'' The passengers were booked into
a luxury hotel near the Frankfurt airport, and were expected to fly
on home on Friday.
   Those waiting to greet the plane included members of a Kuwaiti
family who had been on vacation in Germany when Iraq invaded Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
   ``I want to salute the American ambassador,'' said Bazza
al-Ghanim, who was wearing a ``Free Kuwait'' button on a black
sweatshirt.
   Her businessman husband, Ghassan al-Khalid, a member of the
board of the National Bank of Kuwait, said Kuwaitis ``absolutely
refuse'' to give up any territory if there are negotiations with
Iraq.
   ``We feel our friends will not abandon us,'' he said.
   Howell, Barbara Bodine, the deputy chief of mission in Kuwait,
and three other American diplomats earlier today landed in Baghdad
aboard a U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways plane from Kuwait.
   U.S. officials had said the compound in Kuwait was left
unstaffed but open and that Iraqi authorities had pledged it would
not be disturbed.
   The departure of the American diplomats from Kuwait ended a
four-month diplomatic standoff between the United States and Iraq.
Howell and his colleagues at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait had defied
Iraqi orders to close in August. Gradually, all foreigners but the
British and Americans removed their diplomats as Iraq cut off
supplies and posted soldiers outside the compounds.
   The trapped U.S. diplomats survived for three months on canned
tuna and boiled water from the embassy's swimming pool, but were
allowed emergency supplies in recent weeks. Britain announced
Wednesday that its last embassy employees would leave within the
week.
   In other developments today:
   -A federal judge in Washington today refused to order President
Bush to seek permission from Congress before any attack on Iraqi
forces but reaffirmed the power of lawmakers to declare war. U.S.
District Judge Harold Greene denied a request by 54 Democratic
members of Congress for an injunction to force the president to
seek a declaration of war before launching an attack in the gulf.
   -Saddam Hussein today repeated his often state view that his
nation wants peace but that it will gladly wage war rather than
permit foreign domination of Arab oil or land, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported.
   ``We want peace, endeavor to achieve it, and work to reach a
point where no one of us brandishes his sword against the other.
But if the enemies want to push affairs to a military duel, then by
God's help we would win and would walk over their corpses and tread
on their heads,'' INA quoted Saddam s saying.
   -In another INA report Iraq accused the United States of lying
about the timing of talks in Baghdad and Washington. It said Iraq
had rejected dates proposed by the United States for Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz's trip to Washington and a visit by Secretary
of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad.
   The U.S. State Department says Iraq's insistence on a Jan. 12
date for Baker's visit is too close to the Jan. 15 deadline a U.N.
resolution has set for Iraq to relinquish Kuwait or face possible
attack. Washington said Aziz was scheduled to meet President Bush
on Monday but that the meeting will not take place unless a date
has been set for Baker's visit.
   -In diplomatic moves, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze arrived in Turkey for two days of discussions that
will center on the gulf crisis. Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid
arrived in Iran on the third leg of a new Arab peace initiative.
Bendjedid met with Saddam on Wednesday and Jordan's King Hussein
the day before, but Arab diplomats said he apparently canceled a
stop in Saudi Arabia, indicating his initiative was in trouble.
   Officials in Baghdad said all other foreigners who missed the
charter flight today could leave later by regular flights or by
ground transportation.
   U.S. officials said the departure of the Americans today left
just one American who had been held hostage at a strategic site. He
was identified as Gary O'Conner of Humble, Texas. Officials said he
would go to Basra, Iraq, to finalize his business and leave Iraq at
a later date.
   The charter flight left as part of Iraq's blanket hostage
release announced one week ago. Iraq had barred thousands of
foreigners from travel after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. It held
hundreds of them - mostly Americans, Britons and Japanese - at
strategic sites to deter a feared attack by U.S.-led forces sent to
the region in response to the invasion.
   Before today's flight, about 188 Americans have been evacuated
from Iraq and Kuwait over the last week. U.S. officials estimate
that about 500 Americans - most of them children with dual
citizenship - are remaining.

   The man whose projection of an
earthquake set off disaster drills and a media storm still refuses
to talk about it.
   Iben Browning's 50-50 projection of a quake along the Midwest's
New Madrid Fault on or near Dec. 2 was dismissed by scientists. But
in some communities residents left town for the weekend, school
districts canceled classes and police officials barred troopers
from taking vacations that week.
   He based the projection on unusually high tidal action.
   The fault, running from Marked Tree, Ark., to southern Illinois,
is capable of setting off major quakes - in the early 1800s it rang
church bells in Washington, D.C.
   But nothing happened on Dec. 2.
   Browning, 72, a science consultant for businesses, refused to be
interviewed Wednesday, hanging up twice on The Associated Press.
   ``No one is going to get ahold of me,'' Browning said from his
Sandia Park home. ``I'm not going to give any interviews at all.''
   Browning's wife, Florence, also said he wouldn't comment.
   ``It has not done any good in the past,'' she said.
   Browning's daughter, Evelyn Garriss, had been speaking for him,
but there was no answer at her home.
   However, Mrs. Garriss said Tuesday in Missouri that tidal forces
did not trigger a major quake in the New Madrid Fault zone because
the ``gun'' wasn't loaded.
   Mrs. Garriss, who spoke at the Missouri Governor's Conference on
Agriculture in Osage Beach, Mo., said small earthquakes in the
region during the fall apparently reduced the potential for a
larger quake.
   ``Apparently everything that could be triggered didn't wait, so
there was nothing there,'' she said.
   None of the tremors caused any significant damage.
   Browning's projection was dismissed in October by a group of
scientists who evaluated it for the U.S. Geological Survey. They
said it had no credibility and lacked scientific basis.
   One Missouri scientist who was criticized because he refused to
disassociate himself from Browning's projection has given up his
job.
   Dr. David Stewart said Tuesday he was stepping down as head of
the Center for Earthquake Studies at Southeast Missouri State
University to ensure that the criticism doesn't affect the center
itself.

<HEAD>Pentagon Seeks to Cool Debate Over Allies' Aid to Gulf Operation</HEAD>

   The Pentagon on Thursday said it had
unintentionally understated the value of allied nations'
contributions to the U.S. military operation in the Persian Gulf.
   Pete Williams, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said figures
released Tuesday on allied contributions included only the cash and
military materials that have been received by U.S. forces in the
gulf, not those still en route.
   German officials took strong exception to Williams' remarks on
Tuesday, in which he indicated that Bonn and Tokyo had fallen short
of delivering the cash and materials they promised.
   Williams on Tuesday had said Germany delivered $337 million in
cash and materials as of Oct. 31, compared with its promise to
provide $1.5 billion for Operation Desert Shield by Dec. 31. He
also said Japan had given $426 million against a pledge of $2
billion.
   On Thursday, Williams said the current figure for Japan was
actually $476 million, and that the United States knew that both
Japan and Germany had arranged substantial additional support that
would be received by U.S. forces in the weeks ahead.
   He said Germany, for example, was going to send 30 additional
chemical detection vehicles for U.S. use in Saudi Arabia. Those
vehicles are valued at $65 million, he said. Also, the German air
force is handling some air missions in Europe that normally are the
responsibility of the U.S. Air Force, Williams said.
   ``We're very pleased with what our allies are doing,'' Williams
said, adding that he believed the allies would deliver all the
assistance they promised by year's end.
   The Pentagon spokesman said the ``misunderstanding'' stemmed
from the Pentagon's method of accounting for materials donated to
Desert Shield.
   ``Somewhere in Washington, where all things get twisted in
strange ways, somebody has to make a decision about how we tally
this,'' he said. ``At what point in the system do you count it? And
we simply decided that the easiest way and the way that makes the
most sense is, when we receive it.
   ``That necessarily understates the total effort that's going on
out there.''

<HEAD>EPA Report To Link Cancer and Electromagnetic Fields</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An Environmental Protection Agency report linking
electromagnetic fields to leukemia and brain cancer in children
will be released next week after being held up by the White House
science adviser, the EPA said Thursday.
   Some EPA scientists said the White House was wrong to delay the
report. But the White House science adviser's office told the
agency it was concerned the report would alarm the public, EPA
officials said.
   Similar reservations were expressed by Assistant Secretary of
Health James Mason, the EPA officials said.
   ``They were concerned not about the accuracy of the report,''
said Robert McGaughy, who supervised the report's preparation.
``They were concerned about how people would react to the news.
There is a concern that people will take too seriously the
suggestions that there may be some connection with cancer.''
   Neither White House science adviser D. Allan Bromley nor Mason
were available for interviews Thursday, their offices said.
   The report looked at all kinds of electromagnetic fields, from
those produced by high-power electrical transmission lines to those
produced by household appliances.
   Virtually everyone is exposed to such fields every day.
   Epidemiological, or statistical, studies have linked residential
exposures to childhood cancer and occupational exposures to cancer
in adults, said David Savitz of the University of North Carolina in
Chapel Hill, the author of one of the most important of those
studies.
   Laboratory studies have suggested that living cells can respond
to electromagnetic fields, and researchers have hypotheses as to
why the fields might theoretically cause cancer, he said.
   ``There are credible scientific suggestions of adverse health
effects from these exposures, but the overall body of evidence is
not conclusive,'' said Savitz.
   The EPA report is a review of all existing studies on
electromagnetic fields and cancer. A draft prepared last summer
concluded that the studies ``show a consistent pattern of response
which suggests, but does not prove, a causal link'' between
household power distribution systems and certain cancers in
children.
   The children's cancers were leukemia, brain cancer and lymphoma,
the report said.
   The draft has been revised once, but ``our current conclusions
are very similar,'' McGaughy said.
   David Bayliss, one of the authors, said he was frustrated by the
delay in releasing the report. He said it had been scheduled to go
out Nov. 27.
   ``What is the use of having an Environmental Protection Agency
if you're going to withhold information from the public?'' Bayliss
said. ``I thought the EPA was for letting people know about health
problems, or possible health problems.''
   McGaughy said the report was delayed because of questions raised
by Bromley, and that Mason later expressed some of the same
objections.
   McGaughy said the questions were raised by Bromley at a meeting
McGaughy and other EPA officials attended in Bromley's office on
Nov. 26, the day before the scheduled release.
   The meeting with Mason took place Dec. 6, McGaughy said.
   Erich Bretthauer, the EPA's assistant administrator for research
and development, said it was natural for Bromley and Mason to be
involved, because an interagency federal committee that they
oversee is also studying electromagnetic fields and health hazards.
   ``It is an important area. Many people have concerns about it,
including Dr. Bromley's office and Dr. Mason's office,'' Bretthauer
said. The report will be released next week, he said.
   Bretthauer said Bromley and Mason disagreed with the EPA over
the nuances of the epidemiological studies considered in the
report. ``I don't think they see the data the way we do,''
Bretthauer said. When asked to clarify the disagreements, he said,
``I'm going to refer you to them.''
   In an earlier version, prepared last spring, the agency
tentatively proposed classifying electromagnetic fields as a
``class B1'' carcinogen, meaning that they are a probable source of
human cancer.
   ``But when it went through the peer review inside the agency,
that recommendation was taken out - some say with malice, and some
say without,'' said David Janes, the EPA administrator who
commissioned the study. He is now retired from the EPA.
   Janes said he thought the EPA report would have a great impact,
because of the nature of th risk. ``I think it will create a lot
of apprehension among folks, especially since this is one of those
`you can't see it, feel it or taste it.' And an individual's
exposure is not under an individual's control.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is asking the West,
the KGB and the army to help solve his country's food shortages
while he tackles the much tougher task of trying to keep the Soviet
Union intact.
   All his efforts appear aimed at buying time through what
promises to be a hard winter, and he has no guarantee of success.
   Gorbachev got a boost this week from President Bush, who
promised to back loans for the Kremlin to buy up to $1 billion in
American farm products and $300 million in manufactured goods
through June.
   Other nations, fearing food riots that mcould jeopardize
Gorbachev's reforms, also are rushing to help the Soviets.
   At home, Gorbachev is trying both the carrot and the stick in
his efforts to reassert central control over the nation's
disintegrating political and economic structure.
   He says he will use force to prevent profiteering.
   But neither threats nor force are likely to persuade the
governments of the 15 republics to agree to his proposal that their
economies remain under central control.
   Both topics will be debated Monday when the national Congress of
Peoples' Deputies convenes in the Kremlin for what promises to be a
tumultuous session.
   Conservative lawmakers are urging Gorbachev to declare a state
of emergency, and he has partially obliged them by replacing the
moderate interior minister with generals from the KGB and the army.
   Additionally, he has ordered the KGB, the army and the Interior
Ministry to stop workers in the state distribution system from
stealing food and selling it on the black marke..
   Deliveries of most food products are running from 15 to 44
percent below 1989 levels, according to figures released this week
by the Council of Ministers, which blamed much of the drop on
pilfering and profiteering.
   Tough law enforcement is needed when ``the old administrative
system is being withdrawn and the new market is not in place to
regulate supply and demand'' and prices,'' KGB Maj. Gen. Alexander
N. Karbainov told a news conference Thursday at the agency's
Lubyanka headquarters.
   He said the measures could last ``six months, maybe a year,''
depending on the results.
   The food shortage appears most acute in big Russian cities like
Moscow and Leningrad, and much milder in the countryside and most
of the 14 other republics. Times also seem lean in Armenia and
Moldavia, two republics beset by ethnic unrest.
   To feed the cities, Gorbachev has announced that during the
first three months of 1991, his government will spend 2.1 billion
rubles ($3.57 billion) to import food.
   Bottlenecks in ports and on railroads threaten to prevent that
food from reaching the cities, however, say KGB and army officials
mobilizing to solve the problem. Still, they say it is unlikely
that people will starve.
   ``In this country, there is no such situation as we had in 1921,
when there was famine,'' said Karbainov, referring to the Russian
Civil War, in which millions died from lack of food.
   Feeding the Soviet people this winter could be child's play
compared to holding the Soviet Union together.
   All the republics, including the Russian Federation, have
declared some form of economic and political autonomy.
   In response, Gorbachev is proposing a Union Treaty that would
form a new legal charter for the federation. His version would
retain central control over defense and national security, as well
as energy, transportation and other key industries.
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin and 10 other republic leaders
have agreed to join the treaty negotiations. But they demand
control of natural resources on their own soil, such as oil,
natural gas and gold deposits in Russia; oil and coal of
Kazakhstan; or rich wheat fields in the Ukraine.
   The three Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia,
plus Moldavia, which was part of Romania until World War II, have
refused to join the talks.
   Gorbachev's chances of winning the republics' approval of his
draft proposal appear slim.
   And while it may be possible to send the KGB and the army to
ports, rail yards and warehouses to frighten food industry workers,
it is quite another thing to use force simultaneously against 15
republics in various stages of rebellion.
   ``In the long range, we must stick to democratic methods,'' said
Karbainov, the KGB general. ``Say we cracked down, returned to the
methods of the past. Then in 10 years, we'd right back where we
started.''

<HEAD>Police Groups Urge Justices to Reject Machine Gun-Ownership Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police groups supporting gun control urged the
Supreme Court on Thursday to reject a case that seeks to overturn a
government ban on civilian ownership of new machine guns.
   ``It is absolutely vital that the sale and possession of new
machine guns stay illegal,'' said District of Columbia Police Chief
Isaac Fulwood, speaking for the International Association of Chiefs
of Police. ``Machine guns have no place in civilized society.''
   The National Rifle Association, which supports the case brought
by gunsmith J.D. Farmer Jr. of Smyrna, Ga., was the chief target of
the half-dozen law enforcement officials at a news conference.
   ``I defy the NRA leadership to name one good reason to overturn
the machine gun ban,'' said Don Cahill of the National Fraternal
Order of Police. ``Machine guns are designed to kill large groups
of people and do so quickly. Drug dealers and others bent on
violence are the only ones who need machine guns.''
   The Supreme Court has not yet decided whether to take up the
case of Farmer vs. Stephen E. Higgins, director of the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   A three-judge panel of the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit Court of
Appeals decided unanimously in favor of Higgins on July 11.
   The groups represented by Fulwood and Cahill are among seven
major police organizations, plus the Center to Prevent Handgun
Violence, that submitted a brief to the Supreme Court on Thursday
urging it not to hear Farmer's case.
   ``A great deal is at stake,'' said Dennis A. Henigan, director
of the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence Legal Action Project.
``If the Supreme Court were to endorse anything close to the NRA's
doctrine, it would threaten every sensible gun law in this
country.''
   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms says a 1986 Gun
Control Act amendment prohibits private ownership of machine guns
made after May 18, 1986. Still legal is civilian possession of the
125,000 privately owned machine guns made before then and the
transfer of those older weapons as long as new owners obtain ATF's
approval. Such approval requires fingerprinting, background checks,
endorsement by the local police chief or sheriff and a $200 fee per
gun.
   But NRA attorney Richard E. Gardiner contends the government is
misinterpreting the 1986 legislation.
   ``What it says is that any machine gun made after that date can
be ... possessed under the authority of the United States,''
Gardiner said.
   While the government said that limits ownership of new machine
guns to law enforcement agencies and the military, Gardiner said it
means ownership is open to anyone meeting ATF standards such as
those established for individuals buying the older weapons.
   ``There's a section in the Gun Control Act that specifically
exempts all government agencies from the act,'' he said. ``It would
be meaningless for Congress to create two exemptions for the same
people.''
   The Farmer case would not affect machine gun ownership standards
established by the 1934 National Firearms Act, such as
registration, required approvals and the fee, Gardiner said.
   He rejected the idea that drug dealers and other lawbreakers
would rush to buy new machine guns if the Supreme Court ruled in
Farmer's favor.
   ``They're not the kind of people who like to submit forms to the
federal government,'' Gardiner said.
   But David B. Mitchell, the police chief of Prince George's
County, said:
   ``The simple fact is that drug dealers and others bent on
killing are armed with some of the most sophisticated guns
available and they don't hesitate to use them.''
   ``Every concerned American must truly believe that gun violence
will escalate even more if these military weapons are available
again to the general public,'' said Mitchell, representing the
Police Executive Research Forum.
   Other groups joining the brief were the National Association of
Police Organizations, the National Organization of Black Law
Enforcement Executives, the Major City Chiefs and the Police
Foundation.

<TEXT>
   ABC Sports will be allowed to compensate Cuba
for goods and services involved in broadcasting the 1991 Pan
American Games as part of an agreement announced Thursday by the
Treasury Department.
   The agreement settles a December 1989 lawsuit filed by Capital
Cities-ABC when Treasury rejected ABC's proposal for live coverage
of the games.
   The department contended the proposal, which included an
indirect $6.5 million royalty payment for exclusive U.S. broadcast
rights, was an illegal transaction under the comprehensive U.S.
economic embargo against Cuba.
   Its position was upheld in June by the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York. But ABC appealed the ruling to
the U.S. Circuit Court and settlement discussions began.
   ``The settlement agreement provides the terms and conditions
under which ABC may make limited payments to Cuba for goods
received and services provided by Cuba or Cuban nationals in
connection with the games' broadcast,'' the Treasury announcement
said.

   A judge today threw out a murder charge
against Dr. Jack Kevorkian in the death of an Alzheimer's disease
patient who used his so-called ``suicide machine'' to take her
life.
   Kevorkian turned and shook hands with a defense attorney after
Clarkston District Judge Gerald McNally dismissed a first-degree
murder charge in the death of Janet Adkins.
   McNally said prosecutors failed to prove Kevorkian planned and
carried out Adkins' death June 4, adding she, not Kevorkian, caused
the death. McNally, noting Michigan has no specific law against
assisting suicide, said it is up to the Legislature to clarify
state law.
   Oakland County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Michael Modelski said
he would appeal.
   McNally's ruling came after a two-day preliminary hearing to
determine whether Kevorkian, of suburban Royal Oak, should stand
trial. An outspoken advocate of the concept of doctor-assisted
suicide for the terminally ill, Kevorkian has acknowledged hooking
up Adkins to his machine, which put a lethal combination of drugs
into her bloodstream after she pushed a button.
   The only alternatives available to the judge today were allowing
the first-degree murder charge to go to trial or throwing it out.
He could not substitute a lesser charge.
   On Wednesday, attorneys introduced a suicide note purportedly
signed by Adkins, saying she freely chose to have Kevorkian help
her commit suicide before she deteriorated further from
Alzheimer's.
   Adkins, 54, of Portland, Ore., died shortly after noon June 4.
Later that day, Kevorkian let police search his van and seize his
device before offering a statement about his role in Adkins's
death.
   But the criminal charge, punishable by up to life imprisonment,
wasn't filed until Dec. 3. Oakland County Prosecutor Richard
Thompson filed the charge shortly after the release of an autopsy
report concluding that Adkins committed suicide.
   After the first day of the hearing Wednesday, defense attorney
Geoffrey Fieger said the evidence against Kevorkian amounted to
``zippo. There's less than nothing.''
   Detective Sgt. David Haire of the Michigan State Police had
testified that he and his partner were called to the campground
where the death took place and met Kevorkian, who told them he had
been contacted by Adkins and her husband, Ronald.
   ``They apparently had learned of Dr. Kevorkian's suicide machine
through the press,'' Haire said.
   The device - an oblong metal box containing an electric motor
and supporting a metal rack from which three vials were suspended -
was entered as evidence Wednesday.
   Another witness, Michael Podeszwik, an investigator with the
county medical examiner's office, said Kevorkian had blood on his
hands and pants when they met at the campground. Kevorkian said he
had been having ``some difficulty inserting the needle'' in Adkins'
arm, Podeszwik said.
   The investigator said Kevorkian handed him two pieces of paper.
In the first, Adkins wrote that she wanted to end her life before
her Alzheimer's disease progressed any further; in the second, she
asked that her eyes be donated for transplanting.
   ``This is a decision taken in a normal state of mind and is
freely considered,'' Podeszwik read from the first note. ``I have
Alzheimer's disease and I don't want it to progress any further. I
don't want to put myself or my family through any more of this
terrible disease.''
   Under questioning by Assistant Prosecutor Michael Modelski,
Podeszwik acknowledged he didn't know whether Adkins wrote the
notes.
   The first witness, Dr. Jacob Chason, said that of the more than
10,000 brains he has autopsied in his career, only one showed more
deterioration from Alzheimer's disease than Adkins' brain.
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, irreversible disease
characterized by degeneration of the brain cells.

<HEAD>ANC President Receives Joyous Welcome After 30 Years In Exile</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Oliver Tambo, president of the
African National Congress, came home Thursday after 30 years in
exile and was welcomed joyously by his supporters to a country far
different from the one he left.
   The arrival of the ailing Tambo brought the core of the ANC
leadership together and free in South Africa for the first time
since before the black opposition group was outlawed in April 1960.
   His long-time ANC colleagues, Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu,
both were freed from prison in the past 14 months as part of
reforms that have eliminated major apartheid laws and led to talks
with the white-led government.
   ``The day for which we have all waited has come,'' Mandela told
cheering supporters at an airport welcoming ceremony. ``Comrade
Oliver Tambo, president of the ANC, is here.''
   It was a bittersweet return, as the 73-year-old Tambo clearly
was debilitated by a stroke suffered more than a year ago. He did
not address the crowd of more than 5,000 that waited for hours at
the airport.
   Tambo appeared far weaker and older than Mandela, 72, who spent
27 years in prison.
   He returned during a week in which scores of blacks died in the
chronic factional fighting involving ANC supporters and rivals that
has wracked black townships around Johannesburg for months.
   Tambo's chartered plane arrived from Lusaka, Zambia, nearly two
hours later than expected at Johannesburg's airport.
   Outside, pandemonium broke out when thousands of supporters
spotted the ANC delegation, led by Mandela's red Mercedes, arriving
at the terminal.
   People who had been dancing, singing and chanting ``Viva Tambo''
rushed toward the cars, while a few police officers stood with arms
spread trying to hold them back.
   The exuberant jostling became a panicked run when police brought
out dogs to clear a path for Mandela, his wife Winnie and other ANC
leaders. A local radio station said 18 people suffered dog bites.
Police reported no serious injuries.
   Tambo, using a cane and walking with a limp, chatted with the
ANC leaders on the tarmac, embracing many of them and smiling
broadly. Asked how he was feeling, he said only ``Fine, fine,
fine.''
   It was his first time in South Africa since March 1960, when as
ANC deputy president he was given the task of leading the group's
external mission from exile.
   The white-led government banned the ANC and other anti-apartheid
groups the following month, and they remained outlawed until last
February. Tambo was elected ANC president in 1969.
   Tambo is not as well known as Mandela, who came to symbolize
South Africa's anti-apartheid movement during his imprisonment. But
he is widely regarded as the man who brought the ANC through its
darkest days as a struggling exiled liberation movement.
   ``More than any other person I know in exile, where we are today
can be attributed to his work, his humanity, his brilliance as a
strategist, and his capacity to hold people together,'' said Joe
Slovo, head of the ANC-allied South African Communist Party.
   Tambo suffered a serious stroke in August 1989 and his health
prevented him from returning immediately after the ANC was
legalized. He is expected to return to London in about three weeks
for more treatment after attending a three-day ANC conference that
opens Friday.
   After his arrival, Tambo appeared on an upper level of the
airport parking garage, overlooking the expectant crowd. They
roared as Tambo, his wife Adelaide, and Nelson and Winnie Mandela
raised their fists in salute.
   Tambo had to be helped from the car and to the rail overlooking
the crowd. There were some shouts of anger when Mandela said the
ANC president would not speak.
   ``At the present moment, he wishes just to say he is happy to be
amongst us,'' Mandela said. ``We know we are expressing your wishes
when we say we welcome him with open arms as one of the greatest
heros of Africa.''
   Mandela said Tambo would speak Sunday at an ANC rally and he
appealed for the crowd to disperse peacefully. Minutes later,
police fanned out with dogs and quickly cleared the area.
   Slovo and former anti-apartheid parliamentarian Helen Suzman
expressed disappointment that Tambo was returning at a time of
violence in black townships. Since August, more than 1,000 people
have died in the townships around Johannesburg, mostly in fighting
between supporters of the ANC and the rival Zulu-based Inkatha
Freedom Party.
   ``I think like all of us, he (Tambo) will feel extremely let
down by what is going on, and he'll also feel angered by the role
sinister elements are playing in stoking up these primitive
emotions,'' said Slovo, voicing the common ANC allegation that
security forces arebehind the factional unrest.
   The government and police have denied the accusations.

   Those weren't jeers but cheers
for Roseanne Barr, who revved up her infamous singing voice at a
morale-boosting show for those left behind by Operation Desert
Shield.
   The star of the TV comedy ``Roseanne'' gave a free performance
Wednesday night to about 800 Marines, spouses and children at the
Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center.
   Many thought she wouldn't try singing after her off-key
rendition of the national anthem at a San Diego Padres baseball
game in July went over like a beanball pitch.
   But Barr did anyway.
   ``I must be the greatest singer in the world because my voice
can stop a ... nation,'' she said.
   She then burst into an ear-splitting medley of ``I am Woman,''
``Mandy,'' ``Amazing Grace'' and ``Stand by Your Man.'' For the men
in the audience, she sang, ``To Sir With Love.''
   Her comedy routine, with her husband, Tom Arnold, playing the
straight man, focused on the brash and bawdy - she spat and grabbed
at her crotch between her repertoire of jokes about fat people and
sexual orientation. But that seemed to please her audience just
fine.
   ``She makes you feel she's on your level. She's gone through
what you've gone through,'' said Monique Ramirez, 23, whose husband
is a Marine.

   Penny Marshall says she was so nervous about
directing Robert De Niro in her soon-to-be-released film
``Awakenings'' that she was reduced to mumbling.
   Marshall, 47, who starred in television's ``Laverne &amp; Shirley''
and whose directing credits include ``Big,'' told Parade magazine
in an interview to be published Sunday that nerves took over the
first day of shooting.
   ``I mumbled - that's how my hysteria manifests itself,'' she
said. ``But, thank God, Bobby's a mumbler, too. That first day I
realized he's not difficult to work with, he's just awesome in his
talent.
   ``But then I thought, `Oh, my God, I can't tell him what to do,'
and I started mumbling. Finally he looked at me and said, `Penny,
don't do this to me. Just say what you want and don't get too
nervous.'''
   De Niro and Robin Williams were her choices for the patient and
doctor in ``Awakenings,'' a film about survivors of a great
sleeping sickness epidemic of the 1920s who wake up 40 years later.
   Of her directing style, Marshall said: ``I just wear them down.
I know what I want even if I can't always express it.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Actress Tippi Hedren says there are lessons
to be learned about human behavior from the wild animals at her
Shambala Preserve.
   Miss Hedren, who opened the preserve in 1972 to provide a place
for tigers and elephants who were unwanted or had retired from the
movies, is opening the secluded Antelope Valley park to visitors
Saturday as a fund raiser.
   The money will be used to care for the animals.
   ``I learn a lot about people from them,'' Miss Hedren said of
her cats. ``If people could be as honest as animals, what a
different world it would be.
   ``Lots of people think we're all crazy to be working so closely
with the animals,'' said Miss Hedren.
   ``But we have a very wonderful time getting to know them ...
without using whips and those kinds of circus methods.''
   And while she considers the animals her friends, she concedes
they can be dangerous.
   ``We don't take any of them for granted,'' she said. ``They're
very powerful animals.''
   The actress, who starred in Alfred Hitchcock's ``The Birds'' and
``Marnie'' and appears on daytime television's ``The Bold and the
Beautiful,'' said a tigress named Natasha once shredded her script
because she wanted attention.

   SEATTLE (AP) - A food bank and a youth symphony will be the
getting $32,500 each thanks to a court settlement stemming from a
series of concerts that Michael Jackson canceled.
   Attorneys Thomas Wampold and Aaron Haleva also will get a hefty
$35,000 for their work representing ticket-buyers who sued over the
canceled concerts in October and November 1988. Jackson said he was
ill when he canceled the shows.
   Jackson, the company handling ticket sales for the concerts and
the city of Tacoma agreed Wednesday to contribute $32,500 each to
Northwest Harvest and the Seattle Youth Symphony.
   The plaintiffs picked the Seattle Youth Symphony for the
contribution and the defendants agreed on Northwest Harvest.
   Ticketmaster Inc., which had been accused in the lawsuit of
improperly withholding $2.25 to $3.25 in service fees it charged
for each ticket sold, acknowledged no wrongdoing as part of the
settlement.
   The Los Angeles-based company said it was making the
contributions to Northwest Harvest and the Seattle Youth Symphony
as a charitable gesture to the community.
   Wampold said it was decided to contribute to charity instead of
refunding ticket-buyers because of the cost of distributing small
amounts of cash to a large number of people.

   LONDON (AP) - Paul McCartney is getting a bit of agate in the
Guinness Book of Records for holding the biggest concert in
history.
   McCartney, 48, set the record during a 10-month world tour with
the environmental group Friends of the Earth that began in
September 1989 and included a visit to the United States.
   The entry in the 1991 edition of the book will read: ``Solo
performer: The largest paying audience ever attracted by a solo
performer was an estimated 180,000-184,000 in the Maracana Stadium,
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to hear Paul McCartney ... on 21 Apr.
1990.''
   To celebrate the entry, McCartney, his wife, Linda, their
five-piece band and 600 friends held a party Wednesday night at a
London restaurant with McCartney getting a certificate from the
publishers to mark the record.
   ``It's great to have all the people from the tour back assembled
here,'' McCartney said.

<HEAD>Town Gets Mail For Celebrity Residents of LA Neighborhood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRENTWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The town of Brentwood has little in
common with the posh Los Angeles neighborhood with the same name,
and they're more than 350 miles apart. But its post office is the
lost and found for celebrity mail.
   ``We've gotten letters for Sylvester Stallone, Janet Jackson,
Michael Jackson, Betty White, George Carlin, Marcus Allen, James
Garner, Harrison Ford, and Madonna,'' said Laura de Concepcion,
superintendent of postal services in Brentwood.
   That's the Brentwood in eastern Contra Costa County, east of San
Francisco.
   ``We even got one for President Reagan because he has a ranch
down there somewhere,'' she added.
   The post office with a staff of 17 gets nearly 200 pieces of
misdirected mail each day. Many of those letters and packages are
intended for celebrities who live in Brentwood. The neighborhood in
Los Angeles.
   ``It's not funny,'' said postmaster Manuel Vilchez. ``It creates
a lot more work for the Postal Service. It's time-consuming and
probably irritating to the people who send the letters.''
   Most of the letters end up in the town of 10,000 rather than the
L.A. neighborhood because of addled addresses. They either give the
city as Brentwood but use the Los Angeles zip code, 90049, or
indicate a Los Angeles street with the Brentwood (north) zip code,
94513.
   De Concepcion agrees that getting so much mail with the wrong
address gives her and her colleagues extra work. But it has its
good points.
   ``It kind of breaks the monotony of the day,'' she said. ``Every
time we get a letter for a celebrity, we always make a scene about
it. It's very exciting for us.''
   ``I've never had a telephone call from a celebrity looking for
their mail, but I'm waiting,'' she said.

<HEAD>FCC May Restore Some Cable TV Rate Regulation for Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday proposed new rules that could return to some cities the
right to regulate basic cable television rates.
   Under existing rules, only about 3 percent of the nation's
9,500-plus cable TV systems are under price restraints, and there
have been rising complaints that cable systems raise prices
willy-nilly and get away with poor service.
   The proposed new rules, adopted on a 5-0 vote, would make it
tougher for cable systems to avoid price regulation, while at the
same time avoiding what FCC officials view as heavy-handed
controls.
   The proposal says local communities may regulate a cable
system's ``basic tier'' of services, which includes network
broadcast stations, unless one of the three following conditions
exist:
   -There are six or more unduplicated over-the-air channels
available and the cable system is subscribed to by less than 50
percent of the TV homes in a community.
   -There are other multichannel service providers in the
community, such as microwave cable or direct broadcast satellites,
that are available to 50 percent of the homes with cable and are
actually being subscribed to by 10 percent of those homes.
   -The cable system offers a minimum level of service and programs
at a reasonable price that is comparable to communities in which
there is effective competition. This so-called good actor clause is
favored by a number of FCC commissioners.
   FCC officials would not speculate on how many cable systems
could avoid rate re-regulation under the new proposals.
   Following a period of public comment, the commission will adopt
final rules sometime next year.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said the proposals would ``give some
measure of consumer protection ... and some assurance of fairness''
to the cable TV industry.
   Sikes has championed competition among cable systems and
satellite broadcasters as a means of guaranteeing continued growth
in the cable industry and holding prices down for subscribers.
   National Cable Television Association President James Mooney,
however, said the FCC proposals could hurt the cable industry.
   ``However moderate the intentions of the FCC, this proposal
raises the prospect of the government inhibiting the future
development of cable programming by crimping its economic life
blood,'' Mooney said.
   Gene Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation
of America, said the rules don't get at the root problem: pricing
for the most popular cable programs, such as ESPN, the Turner
networks and Discovery Channel, which cable systems typically don't
offer on the basic tier.
   ``This will offer only the slightest protection for consumers
and still leave them totally at the mercy of cable operators for
the most popular programs,'' Kimmelman said.
   Congress this year nearly passed a cable rate re-regulation
bill. The legislation passed the House, but a White House veto
threat held up a Senate measure that included provisions
restricting the ability of cable programmers to hold exclusive
rights to programs.
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said Thursday that Congress was
likely to approve new legislation next year.
   ``Any new law must cover the services for which most people buy
cable, not just the services they can receive for free,'' Lieberman
said.
   Prior to enactment of the 1984 Cable Act, most local cable
franchising authorities were allowed to regulate the prices cable
TV systems charged for their basic tiers. But effective in 1987,
the cable act removed local regulation except for cable systems
with effective competition.
   The act still allows regulated cable systems to raise rates for
basic service 5 percent annually without approval of local
franchising authorities.
   In the wake of deregulation, cable TV prices soared. The
congressional General Accounting Office found that rates for basic
service climbed 29 percent on average between December 1986 and
October 1988 - four times the rate of inflation. At the same time,
the average number of basic channels offered increased from 24 to
30 on the lowest-priced basic tier.
   The GAO found this year that prices climbed another 10 percent
in 1989, or twice the inflation rate.
   The cable industry said it was only playing catchup after years
of local regulation that held prices artificially low.
   Cable systems today aren't totally free from regulation: they
pay hundreds of millions of dollars in franchising fees annually
and are required to provide community access channels and make
certain other public service commitments.

<TEXT>
   Calling it the nation's worst case of
graffiti damage, the city attorney has charged a young man with 20
misdemeanor counts of vandalism and trespassing.
   Daniel Ramos, 18, is accused of painting the word ``Chaka'' on
10,000 sites in Southern California, causing about $500,000 in
damage. The word is scrawled on utility poles and traffic signs, or
lovingly painted in rainbow-colored murals on buildings and
retaining walls.
   Wednesday's charges are in addition to 28 misdemeanor counts
handed to Ramos two days after his Nov. 28 arrest.
   ``The extent of the property damage makes this the worst case of
graffiti vandalism we have seen in Los Angeles or heard of anywhere
else in the nation,'' City Attorney James Hahn said.
   Ramos, in custody on $10,000 bail since his arrest, is scheduled
for trial Dec. 20. Each charge carries a maximum six-month jail
term and a $1,000 fine.
   If Ramos is convicted, Hahn said he would seek jail time and ask
that Ramos be ordered to spend ``a substantial period of time
cleaning up graffiti.''

<HEAD>Broadway Remembers the Musical Theater Career of Leonard Bernstein</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Broadway celebrated the musical theater of
Leonard Bernstein with songs and remembrances by family, friends
and performers who appeared in such shows as ``West Side Story,''
``On the Town'' and ``Candide.''
   ``I cannot remember any more joyous collaboration than we had on
`West Side Story,''' said Jerome Robbins, who directed and
choreographed Bernstein's best known theater work. ``I think
Lenny's music was the lifeblood of that show. You couldn't have had
those dances without the music.''
   Betty Comden, who with her partner Adolph Green collaborated
with Bernstein on ``Wonderful Town'' and ``On The Town,'' recalled
the first time she met the composer in the early 1940s. Bernstein
talked and played the piano all night long.
   ``I went home, woke my mother up and said, `Mom, I just met a
genius,''' Comden told the audience Thursday. ``And you know, I was
right.''
   ``In `On the Town,' I sang this many times. This time it's
between Lenny and me, OK?,'' asked Nancy Walker before she barreled
through ``I Can Cook, Too,'' a number she first performed on
Broadway in 1944.
   Bernstein, who died on Oct. 14 at age 72, also was lauded at the
Majestic Theater by his son, Alexander. He called his father a
triple-threat man of the musical theater - an enthusiastic amateur
actor, singer and dancer who made up in flamboyance what he lacked
in skill.
   Director Arthur Laurents, who served as master of ceremonies for
the program, talked about the paradoxes of Bernstein's career in
which he wanted more recognition from the world of classical music
than of musical theater.
   ``While he was truly a democratic man, musically he was an
elitist,'' said Laurents. ``To him, the holy word, the desired
word, was opera. Musical theater was lower-case, second-best.''
   Actor Michael Wager, the composer's best friend, spoke movingly
of Bernstein's last days when the composer was in a great deal of
pain, but worried about being a burden to his friends and family.
   Among the other performers were Carol Lawrence, the original
Maria in ``West Side Story,'' who sang ``I Feel Pretty'' and
``Tonight,'' Barbara Cook who sang a section of Bernstein's
``Mass,'' Phyllis Newman and Lauren Bacall who did the duet
``Ohio'' from ``Wonderful Town'' and Marilyn Horne who sang what
Laurents said was Bernstein's best-known song, ``Somewhere'' from
``West Side Story.''
   Throughout the proceedings, a photograph of Bernstein peered
down from high above the stage. It showed a beaming Bernstein
skipping out of the National Theater in Washington after the
premiere of ``West Side Story'' 33 years ago. After the memorial,
the audience stood, cheered and applauded the photo.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Major Concessions Needed to Achieve Farm Trade Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should retreat from its
demand for deep farm subsidy cuts provided the European Community
makes at least some concessions in the quest for an international
agreement on agricultural trade, a team of analysts said Thursday.
   John A. Schnittker, a Washington-based consultant, said the
breakup in Brussels last week of the four-year-old Uruguay Round of
negotiations put the talks ``about where we expected,'' with little
prospect of a deal unless the two sides back off in their bitter
dispute over farm subsidies.
   Some believe the talks will resume after some weeks of cooling
off, possibly next month in Geneva.
   As it stood when the talks were suspended, the United States and
the Cairns Group of nations - which includes Australia, Argentina,
Uruguay and others - wanted cuts of 75 percent in internal price
supports and market barriers, and 90 percent reductions in export
subsidies over a 10-year period.
   The European Community refused, saying such cuts would force
more than 20 percent of its 10 million farmers from the land.
   Schnittker and economist William H. Meyers of Iowa State
University commented on a report they and Dermot Hays, another Iowa
State economist, had written for a professional journal, in which
they argued the United States would be served by lowering its
sights on the subsidy issue.
   The article in Choices, published by the American Agricultural
Economics Association, contended that ``political flexibility in
the EC is very limited'' and that it might be best to settle for
whatever new offer - provided there is real movement - the bloc is
likely to make.
   ``It is more important, in our view, to bind the maximum
concessions the EC is willing to make by the end of February -
assuming they will go somewhat beyond their standing offer - than
it is to ensure deep subsidy and tariff reductions,'' Schnittker
said.
   If not, he added, failure of the talks ``would leave the U.S.
cutting farm subsidies unilaterally, while we cannot be sure that
Europe and Japan will be forced by internal pressures to follow
suit.''
   Further, he said, ``Substantial trade gains would accrue to the
U.S. and Cairns Group countries from a deal only slightly beyond
present EC offers.''
   Members of the EC include Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Britain, Spain
and Portugal.

   A final evacuation flight landed in Germany Thursday carrying
the U.S. ambassador to Kuwait and his staff, who survived a 110-day
Iraqi siege of their embassy by living on tuna fish and swimming
pool water.
   The five U.S. diplomats from Kuwait were among 32 Americans on
the Iraqi Airways flight from Baghdad to Germany, the State
Department said.
   Ambassador Nathaniel Howell, looking thinner from the ordeal and
his gray hair longer, told reporters on arrival in Frankfurt that
his staff left the embassy ``with the flag flying.''
   ``We're very happy to be here. We're delighted that Americans
who wanted to leave did,'' he said.
   Asked if the embassy staff had endured, as reported, a diet of
tuna sandwiches, Howell deadpanned: ``No, the bread ran out.''
   The 50-year-old diplomat declined to speak at length, explaining
that ``we haven't had electriciy and water, hot water, at night for
110 days. So, we're going to take advantage of that.''
   The passengers were booked into a luxury hotel near the airport.
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said they would fly
to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington on Friday afternoon.
   The Americans included 23 private U.S. citizens, the five-member
Kuwaiti mission staff and four U.S. officials who joined the flight
in Baghdad, Ms. Tutwiler said in Washington. They were among 96
foreigners aboard, she said.
   While Iraq was allowing the completion of a blanket hostage
release announced one week ago, it accused Washington of lying
about a schedule for U.S.-Iraq talks. It denied U.S. reports that
Washington had offered 15 possible dates for Secretary of State
James A. Baker III's trip to Baghdad, all of which had been
rejected.
   Saddam Hussein said Thursday that Iraq wants peace but would
fight rather than permit foreign domination of Arab lands and oil.
   ``We would win and would walk over their corpses and tread on
their heads,'' the official Iraqi News Agency quoted him as saying.
The Iraqi president has made similar statements in the past.
   Howell, his deputy chief of mission, Barbara Bodine, and three
other American diplomats in Kuwait left their embassy early
Thursday and flew to Baghdad and then Frankfurt aboard a
U.S.-chartered Iraqi Airways plane.
   A U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad said the compound in Kuwait
was left unstaffed but open, and that Iraqi authorities had pledged
it would not be disturbed.
   The departure of the American diplomats ended a four-month
diplomatic standoff between the United States and Iraq. Washington
had defied Iraqi orders to close the mission in August.
   Gradually, all foreigners but the British and Americans removed
their diplomats as Iraq cut off supplies and posted soldiers
outside the compounds. The trapped U.S. diplomats subsisted for
three months on canned tuna and boiled water from the embassy's
swimming pool, but were allowed emergency supplies in recent weeks.
   Howell's determination before the Iraqi troops made him a hero
to the people he protected.
   ``He's a hero, like John Wayne,'' said Jack Rinehart of Stover,
Mo., who was one of those trapped in the embassy before his
release. ``He drak the same dirty water, he slept outside with the
flies and the heat.''
   The flight was the final U.S. charter evacuating hostages, and
was said to be the last chartered by any country. Officials in
Baghdad said all foreigners who missed the charter could leave
later by regular flights or by ground transportation.
   Last week, Iraq announced it would free thousands of foreigners
it had detained after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Hundreds of
them - mostly Americans, Britons and Japanese - were held at
strategic sites to deter a feared attack by U.S.-led forces.
   U.S. officials said just one former American ``human shield''
remained behind. He was identified as Gary O'Conner of Humble,
Texas. Officials said he would go to Basra, Iraq, to finalize his
business and leave Iraq at a later date.
   Before Thursday's flight, about 188 Americans had been evacuated
from Iraq and Kuwait over the last week. Seventy of those had been
in hiding, 86 men were held as ``human shields'' and 32 private
citizens had taken refuge in U.S. diplomatic compounds. U.S.
officials estimate about 500 Americans - most of them children with
dual citizenship - remained behind.
   Also Thursday, Iraq's news agency said Iraq had rejected dates
proposed by the United States for Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz's
trip to Washington and Baker's trip to Baghdad.
   The agency, quoting a Foreign Ministry statement, accused
Washington of ``spreading untrue reports about the fixing of the
dates.''
   The State Department says Iraq's proposed Jan. 12 date for
Baker's visit is too close to the Jan. 15 deadline the United
Nations has set for Iraq to relinquish Kuwait or face possible
attack.
   Washington said Aziz was scheduled to meet President Bush on
Monday but that the meeting will not take place unless a date has
been set for Baker's visit.
   In another development, a federal judge in Washington on
Thursday refused to order Bush to seek permission from Congress
before any attack on Iraqi forces but reaffirmed the power of
lawmakers to declare war. U.S. District Judge Harold Greene denied
a request by 54 Democratic members of Congress for an injunction to
force the president to seek a declaration of war before launching
an attack in the gulf.

<DATELINE>INDIANOLA, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest catfish processor,
accused of a ``plantation'' management philosophy, agreed on a
tentative contract with workers to end a sometimes violent strike.
   Delta Pride Catfish Inc. and the United Food and Commercial
Workers Local 1529 reached the agreement Wednesday following two
days of intensive negotiations, federal mediator E. Dale Cline said
Thursday.
   If approved, the contract would end a 13-week strike by a mostly
black work force that had placed the issue of working conditions on
an equal footing with pay. Besides wages, the common complaint
among workers was repetitive motion injury.
   Workers also complained that they were timed with a stopwatch
when skinning, gutting, slicing and packaging fish. They also
complained of limited restroom breaks. Laborers were allowed six
five-minute bathroom breaks per week. Violators risked dismissal.
   Details of the agreement will not be disclosed until after union
ratification, Cline said.
   A ratification vote is scheduled for Friday.
   Union spokesman Neel Lattimore declined to speculate on the
outcome of Friday's vote, but said a bargaining committee
overwhelmingly approved the pact.
   Union members said the contract protects the jobs of the
striking workers.
   Scattered violence marked the dispute early in the strike, but
the walkout had been peaceful in recent weeks.
   The workers' plight in one of the country's most economically
depressed regions attracted support from the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People and other civil rights
organizations and led to a national boycott of Delta Pride
products.
   The national attention from the strike prompted state
Agriculture Commissioner Jim Buck Ross and others to warn that the
state's catfish industry in jeopardy.
   ``We are pleased to put all of this behind us,'' said Larry
Joiner, Delta Pride president and chief executive officer. ``We did
some hard bargaining and believe we came up with a fair and
equitable settlement.''
   Joiner said he hoped ratification would end the national
boycott. Several grocery chains had refused to buy the catfish,
which are raised on farm ponds across the Mississippi Delta.
   About 900 of the union's 1,200 members walked out of Delta
Pride's Indianola and Inverness plants Sept. 13 after rejecting a
proposed contract. Most of the strikers are black women. Workers
remained on the job at two other plants.
   Aaron Henry, president of the Mississippi NAACP, said the
worker's anger stemmed from ``a combination of race and economics
coupled with the philosophy of the plantation.''
   Before the strike, the average wage at Delta Pride was $4.05 an
hour, which for a full-time job amounts to $8,424 a year.
Probationary employees start at minimum wage.
   Delta Pride had offered average raises of 4.8 percent during the
first year of the three-year contract and raises ranging from 35 to
90 cents per hour the next two years. But it was rejected.
   In October, the company reported that it hired more than 500
replacement workers.

<HEAD>Study Shows Women, Blacks Charged More for Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women and blacks who bargain for a new ca are
given higher final prices than white men, according to a study
surveying hundreds of car dealerships.
   Black woman were offered the highest prices, averaging $875 per
care more than white men, the study found.
   Ian Ayres, a Northwestern University law professor who headed
the research, said Thursday the study results may be attributable
to car dealers trying to concentrate profits by targeting a
relatively few customers - ``suckers'' - who will pay higher
markups.
   That may not be bigotry, but it's definitely discrimination,
Ayres said.
   ``Treating black people differently in order to increase your
revenues runs afoul of our traditional civil rights norms,'' Ayres
said.
   An official with the National Automobile Dealers Association
denied that any responsible salesman would target a person by race
or sex, especially since most people go to several different
dealers and play one off another while shopping. And while he
hadn't seen the study, NADA vice president Frank McCarthy said the
premise was not valid.
   The study began three years ago and involved 90 Chicago-area
dealerships. A follow-up survey of between 275 to 300 dealerships
was conducted during the past year.
   In the first study, three white male researchers divided among
themselves dealerships selling the same brand of domestic car, then
tried to get the best deal on a new car.
   Each dealership also was visited at about the same time by one
of three other researchers - a white woman, a black woman and a
black man - who bargained over the same car. The researchers were
prepared with carefully rehearsed negotiating tactics to get the
best deal.
   The make and model of the car was not disclosed, but researchers
estimated the dealers' cost at about $11,000.
   The study found that white men received final offers that
averaged about $11,362 on a new car with a sticker price of
$13,465.
   The white woman was given an average final price of $11,504, the
black man an average final price of $11,783 and the black woman an
average price of $12,237. No cars were actually purchased.
   Ayres said that researchers were given the worst deals by
salespeople of the same race and gender.
   The more comprehensive follow-up study involved 36 testers and
visits to between 275-300 area dealerships, domestic and foreign.
Each time a white male bargained and either a black man or woman or
white woman bargained on the same car.
   That study yielded similar results, except that black men were
given slightly higher final prices than black women, Ayres said.
   Ayres is still analyzing both studies, the first of which is the
subject of an article to appear in the February issue of the
Harvard Law Review.
   But he said the surveys indicate dealers may assume that blacks
and women are less knowledgeable about cars and the bargaining
process than white males, and therefore more willing to accept a
higher price. Ayres said a survey of consumers last spring by the
Consumer Federation of America indicated blacks were less likely
than whites to know they could bargain over the price of a new car.
   It's not discrimination if car dealers get a higher price from
someone who can't bargain effectively, said David Wellman, a
research sociologist at the Institute for the Study of Social
Change at the University of California, Berkeley.
   But it is discrimination if the woman and the blacks can't get
the car below a given price and a white man can, Wellman said.
   ``If the data show that the price that's quoted to black women
is consistently $800 over what white men were quoted, the color of
their skin and their gender must be the reason,'' said Wellman, who
wrote the book ``Portraits of White Racism,'' 10 years ago.

Institute said they were ``cautiously optimistic.''
   They said, however, that the girl has been on the therapy only
since September and won't be completely evaluated until after she
has had three more treatments, which she comes in for monthly.
   Blaese said he expects to begin gene therapy in January on a
second patient with the same disease - a rare genetic condition
called ADA deficiency, which deprives the patient of an immune
system. He declined to identify the patient, and also has declined
to identify the first patient, citing the parents' wish for
privacy.
   Blaese and Dr. W. French Anderson of the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Institute briefed a Food and Drug Administration advisory
panel on the status of the ADA experiment and another gene therapy
experiment that will involve patients with malignant melanoma, a
lethal form of skin cancer.
   The 4-year-old girl was born with a defective gene that does not
produce an enzyme called adenosine deaminase, or ADA. Without this
enzyme, her immune system does not function and leaves her with no
protection against infections.
   Along with gene therapy, she has continued receiving an enzyme
replacement therapy with weekly injections of a drug called
PEG-ADA, which decreases the severity of infections but does not
fully restore an immune system.
   The gene-therapy treatments involve inserting normal,
ADA-producing genes into cells that are then infused into the
patient's blood, where scientists hope they will produce more cells
with the normal ADA-producing gene.
   One hopeful sign is that her T-cell count - the number of these
immune system cells in her blood - are in the normal range for the
first time in her life, Blaese said.
   Also, other tests show that the corrected cells are surviving
and that the new gene is working, producing ADA.
   Scientists hope that ``as we progress down the road with this
gene transfer, give her more and more cells over a period of time,
it will get better and better and better,'' Blaese said.
   On the melanoma gene-therapy experiments, Anderson said he
expected the first patient to begin treatment in about three weeks.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday urged the passage
of state laws to protect public-service volunteers from personal
liability in lawsuits arising from their efforts.
   Explaining the rationale for the measures, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh cited a case in which a Little League baseball coach was
sued after he shifted a youth from shortstop to the outfield, and
the youngster was subsequently injured.
   The parents said their son was a ``born shortstop'' and should
not have been moved, Thornburgh said, adding that the coach was
held legally liable for the injury.
   Bush, addressing a gathering of volunteer leaders, said:
   ``I'm determined to help remove barriers to public service. No
obstacle - no obstacle is more chilling than the fear of personal
liability and the high cost of insurance to protect against
liability.''
   Bush urged enactment of model state legislation protecting
volunteers while providing ``a reasonable basis for the recovery of
damages which may arise from volunteer activity.''
   He also urged creation of a private, national volunteer risk
management center where organizations could turn for advice and
assistance.

<HEAD>Commission Weighs Korean War Memorial Depicting Soldiers Under
Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The latest design proposal for the $14.9
million Korean War veterans' memorial illustrates ``the reality of
actual war'' by depicting soldiers under fire, the architects told
a federal commission Thursday.
   In a stormy, two-hour meeting, the Commission on Fine Arts heard
representatives of the Cooper-Lecky architectural firm argue for
the battle scene rather than the less explicit prize-winning design
submitted earlier by four Pennsylvania State University architects.
   W. Kent Cooper noted the firm's design would show ``some hostile
action'' involving a column of 38 soldiers, including Air Force
observers looking to call in an air strike.
   The design would confront visitors ``with the reality of actual
war,'' said sculptor Frank Gaylord, who is working with
Cooper-Lecky on the project.
   Critics have said the design glorifies war. The commission -
along with several other groups - must decide whether to accept the
plan, or choose instead the rival design submitted by the Penn
State group last year. It could also request a combination of the
two.
   The university architects attended Thursday's meeting with their
attorney, Robert Sokolove. They won a $20,000 contest last year to
design the memorial across the Reflecting Pool from the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial. The entry was declared the winner by a jury of
Korean War veterans.
   The Penn State design called for ``a dream-like'' collection of
soldiers moving, some unevenly, across a remote landscape toward an
American flag.
   Problems began after the design was unveiled at a White House
ceremony on June 14, 1989.
   The original architects said the plan was for the government to
retain a second firm to ``implement'' the original, prize-winning
idea. What happened, Sokolove said recently, is that Cooper-Lecky
submitted its own design amounting to a ``GI Joe battle scene.''
   ``This was not a concept competition. This was a design
competition,'' Sokolove told the commission. ``We have a jury
system in this country. A jury has spoken in this case once.''
Sokolove said the group would consider a lawsuit if its design was
turned down.
   But retired Army Gen. Richard Stilwell said in a statement that
the original architects ``relinquished all rights to their
submission in consideration of substantial prize money.''
   Stillwell heads a board created by Congress to oversee the
project. He said the new design retains the essential element of
the old one - a column advancing toward an American flag.
   The advisory board said the changes - including structural ones
so the memorial can accommodate large crowds - were based on
suggestions by the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capitol
Planning Commission. Both commissions must still approve the final
plan.
   ``You hate to see this kind of dispute between two talented
teams of designers,'' Fine Arts Commissioner Robert Peck said.
   Some 5.7 million Americans served in Korea during the 1950-53
conflict, and more than 54,000 were killed.

<HEAD>FCC Implements Rules on Operator Services Companies</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-FCC-Cable TV</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday began implementing a law designed to crack down on a new
breed of companies that provide long-distance telephone service to
the traveling public.
   The commission, in a 5-0 vote, approved rules to comply with the
Telephone Operator Consumer Services Improvement Act of 1990, which
President Bush signed Oct. 17.
   The law deals with so-called alternative operator service
companies that handle ``dial-O'' calls, such as collect,
person-to-person and charge card calls, made by travelers. These
companies, which sprouted in the wake of the 1984 breakup of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., lease phone lines from
long-distance carriers such as AT&amp;T, MCI and US Sprint.
   The new companies have been the subject of thousands of
complaints to the FCC for excessively high charges.
   As of Jan. 15, these companies will have to:
   -Clearly identify themselves to customers twice, once when the
operator answers and again before the call is connected.
   -Provide information on rates and the FCC complaint process.
   -Not bill for unanswered calls.
   -Not engage in ``call splashing,'' the practice of a company,
unable to complete a call, switching it to an operator in a distant
city. In such a case, the caller gets a bill from a place he or she
never visited.
   -Provide a schedule ofprices to the FCC.
   Hotels, schools and others using alternate operator service
companies also must post specific information on or near their
phones and not block access to other long-distance companies by
means of 950 or 800 numbers.
   The new rules were to have become effective in mid-November, but
the companies affected persuaded Congress, after it passed the law,
that they needed more time to comply.
   Also on Thursday, the commission initiated investigations
designed to monitor the operator services industry and to consider
whether pay phone owners should be compensated for customers who
use toll-free access numbers to reach their long-distance carriers.
   The commission also will address the issue of 10XXX access
numbers. (AT&amp;T customers, for example, when traveling may reach
AT&amp;T by first dialing 10288.) By mid-1992, all new, non-residential
phone equipment must be able to reach the 10XXX access numbers.
   The American Public Communications Council of the North American
Telecommunications Association has suggested to the FCC that pay
phone owners receive 25 cents for each access call.
   AT&amp;T has lobbied the FCC for 10XXX access, saying it would cost
it as much as $50 million to develop and $250 million a year to
operate an 800 access number. AT&amp;T also argues that 10XXX access
offers better sound quality and service than 800 or 950 numbers.
   But hotels and similar users complain it would cost thousands of
dollars to upgrade existing switchboards to handle 10XXX calls.

   As World War II neared its end, the last 47
Jews in Chelmno concentration camp wrote a collective will.
   They had nothing to bequeath but love for their families, and
the hope of being posthumously avenged. Ten days later when the
Soviet Army arrived, all but two of the prisoners had been shot.
   The colective will lay in a Soviet archive for 45 years, until
an Israeli historian discovered it this week among a delivery of
thousands of documents from Moscow.
   ``Armed soldiers stand around us. What can I do? Please tell my
brothers Yitzhak Lazer and Mordechai Motek and my sister Hava in
Moscow of my fate. I have another sister, Regina, in America.
Please tell them my last wish before I die ... to avenge my death
and the death of all the many Jews who were murdered like
animals,'' wrote 16-year-old Berek Himelfarb.
   Berek was among the last to die of the more than 300,000 Jews
murdered by the Nazis at Chelmno in west-central Poland.
   Shmuel Krakowski, chief archivist of the Yad Vashem Holocaust
Memorial, said the will ``is their victory over the Germans.
   ``They were bound with shackles and it was the only thing they
could do ... to see that the world knows about (the Nazis')
crimes,'' he said.
   The will, signed by 10 of the prisoners, was written on January
9, 1944, eight days before they were murdered. The 7th Division of
the 1st Byelorussian Front liberated the camp three days later on
January 20.
   ``One of the Polish peasants found it, we don't know how, and he
gave it to the first Russian soldiers he met when they entered the
camp,'' Krakowski said.
   In a telephone interview Thursday, Krakowski said he found the
will among thousands of pages of material brought to Israel by Ilya
Altman of the Central State Archives in Moscow as part of an
agreement with Yad Vashm.
   The will had been translated from Polish into Russian.
   It opens by saying it is being written in the name of the last
47 prisoners at the camp.
   ``Attention, the fortunate person who discovers these papers,
please, read them diligently and tell it to everyone, and our
relatives who have remained alive,'' it says.
   It describes the machinery of extermination at the camp, and
then presents individual testaments from prisoners, who apparently
came from nearby Lodz.
   ``Our hearts are hardened with the U.S. and British governments.
They could have, if they wanted, stopped most of the German
massacres, and prevented the murder of hundreds of thousands of
Jews in this terrible death. I must end because my eyes are burning
with tears and I must lie down on the floor. I beg you, fortunate
people, you must avenge us and our families,'' wrote Yitzhak
Zydelman.
   Berek Himelfarb wrote: ``When I see how they murder thousands of
innocent Jews, my heart is torn. I am only 16 and they have put
shackles on my feet like a criminal.''
   Two of the 47 escaped, including Tavek Srebrink who testified at
the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem.
Eichmann was hanged in 1962.
   The will also lists the names of the German officers and
soldiers in the camp. Twelve Chelmno SS men were sentenced in a
trial in Bonn in 1963 to one to 20 years' imprisonment.

<TEXT>
   An opposition rally to protest alleged vote
fraud turned into a bloody clash with riot police that killed three
people and injured up to 50 in the small town of Tejupilco in
Mexico state, officials said Thursday.
   Mexico City newspapers ran pictures of police clubbing fleeing
women, armed peasants charging City Hall, burning cars and sprawled
bodies. State government spokesman Cesar Silva said fighting raged
for hours Wednesday.
   The melee in the town of about 7,000 people, 80 miles southwest
of the capital, brought to a boil Mexico's long conflict over clean
elections.
   State officials accused Herberto Castillo, a founder of the
opposition, center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), and
other local PRD leaders of masterminding the City Hall takeover and
threatened prosecution. Castillo denied he instigated violence.
   State officials said two police officers and one civilian were
killed and 40 to 50 people injured. Four people were arrested on
arms charges.
   The PRD says Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, cheated in Nov. 11 state and local elections
throughout Mexico. PRD activists believe their party was robbed in
the Tejupilco mayoral race and have held a sit-in at a plaza
outside City Hall since the election.
   Wednesday's riot started about 3 p.m. after a confrontation
between riot police guarding City Hall and a group of women
attending a PRD rally.
   What provoked the confrontation was unclear, but PRD and state
officials agree that caos broke out when police lobbed tear gas
grenades into the packed town square and shots rang out.
   ``From where I was on the speakers' platform, I could see riot
police clubbing the women. Within seconds they began firing tear
gas grenades. People started running but police blocked every exit
from the plaza,'' said Castillo.
   Townspeople charged City Hall, battled police with bricks,
boards and guns and destroyed six police cars, Silva said.
   He and Castillo spoke in telephone interviews Thursday.
   Silva said about 80 riot police were on guard outside City Hall
and about 200 were inside. He said they carried no firearms.
   But Castillo said he saw officers grab guns from patrol cars as
the battle flared and police reinforcements poured into town.
   Silva said state officials had sent police to Tejupilco because
of rumors the PRD would try to take over City Hall the day of the
rally.
   Castillo said state officials ``planned and provoked'' the
violence ``to create an image of violence'' for his party.
   He did not deny some people came to the rally armed, or may have
had automatic weapons.
   ``This is a hot area with a lot of guns and a lot of drug
trafficking,'' he said. ``It's not impossible that people had these
kinds of arms.''
   Castillo insisted, however, that the protesters were provoked by
a police attack on innocent, unarmed women.
   Silva said the PRD started the fight.
   ``What began as a peaceful meeting degenerated into violence
when one speaker told the women to take over City Hall,'' he said.
   He conceded that police may have reacted strongly to what was
probably ``verbal aggression'' at the outset.
   PRD supporters in neighboring Michoacan and Guerrero states have
taken over several city halls, complaining of vote fraud since
1988, when a PRD founder, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, lost the
presidential race to Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   The PRI has been in power in Mexico since 1929.
   Official results in the Tejupilco race gave the PRI candidate
6,700 votes and the PRD candidate 3,599. ``This adds up to over
10,000 votes, more than the population of Tejupilco,'' Castillo
said.

<HEAD>More Warplanes Deploying to Gulf; Navy Calls on Medical Reservists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force said Thursday it is sending more
warplanes to Saudi Arabia from Germany and Britain. The Navy
announced the activation of hundreds of reservists for medical duty
in the Persian Gulf.
   Also, the Pentagon said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen.
Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will travel
to Saudi Arabia next week to visit American troops and to meet with
Saudi government officials.
   Cheney and Powell will leave Washington Tuesday and return Dec.
23.
   The Air Force announcement is the latest in a string of
deployments designed to give the United States a stronger offensive
air capability in the event President Bush orders U.S. forces into
combat against Iraq.
   The Air Force said it is dispatching an undisclosed number of
F-16 fighter jets and their crews to the Middle East from the 50th
Tactical Fighter Wing Hahn Air Base in Germany starting Jan. 8. A
wing normally includes about 70 aircraft.
   Also preparing for deployment to the gulf area are elements of
the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing from Royal Air Force Station
Alconbury in Britain. The wing will send an undisclosed number of
A-10 ``Warthog'' anti-armor aircraft starting Jan. 23.
   Squadrons of F-16s and A-10s deployed to the gulf in August with
the first wave of U.S. forces, along with dozens of other Air
Force, Army and Marine Corps aircraft.
   The Air Force deployments are part of a broad buildup of U.S.
reinforcements in the gulf area. Officials have declined to provide
details on numbers of planes and aviators being sent, but it is
believed that at least 300 additional Air Force planes are headed
to the gulf, along with at least 10,000 personnel.
   In a related development, the Army said it put 1,400 Army
Reserve members from 10 states on active duty for Desert Shield.
Most are specialists in personnel processing.
   In its announcement, the Navy said it was ordering to active
duty 2,388 reservists from 94 Navy Reserve units in 24 states,
mostly to provide medical support.
   Thousands more medical specialists are needed for Desert Shield
because of Bush's decision in early November to send up to 200,000
soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen to the gulf as
reinforcements. By January the U.S. force arrayed against Iraq is
expected to number as many as 430,000 personnel.
   Pete Williams, a Pentagon spokesman, said the deployment of
additional medical personnel and supplies is on schedule and will
continue according to a logistics plan that tries to match field
medical services with projected combat casualties.
   Defense officials have declined to make public the Pentagon's
estimates of casualties in the event of war against Iraq. Williams
said information about the number of hospital beds and other
medical supplies also is highly classified.
   ``That gives a glimpse into where and what you expect to
happen,'' if the crisis turns to war, ``and that could give an
indication of future operational expectations,'' Williams said in
explaining why medical plans are secret.
   The spokesman said the most he could reveal is the types of
hospital units being deployed to the gulf. He named Air Force
air-transportable hospitals, with 50 beds each; Army MASH units
with 60 beds each; evacuation hospitals with 400 beds apiece;
combat support hospitals with 200 beds each; field hospitals with
400 beds each, and Navy hospital ships with 1,000 beds apiece.
   Williams also said that some private hospitals in the United
States have been alerted that the Pentagon may need some of their
beds in the event of a gulf war. He gave no details but said
Defense Department and Veterans Administration hospitals would be
used before civilian hospitals.

   Farmers aren't dancing in their fields in
reaction to President Bush easing trade restrictions on the Soviet
Union and granting $1 billion in federal credit to buy U.S.
agricultural products.
   Words of praise for the move announced Wednesday were tempered
with criticism Thursday.
   ``My first reaction is: `Too little. Too late,' '' said Milton
Giedinghagen, a Stafford wheat farmer who heads the Kansas
Association of Wheat Growers. ``I hope it does people over there
some good.''
   As the nation's No. 1 wheat-producing and flour-milling state,
Kansas has a significant stake in the agricultural export trade.
From two-thirds to three-fourths of the hard red winter wheat
raised in the state is exported.
   Giedinghagen noted that prices for cash wheat dipped nearly 4
cents Thursday because the grain markets had expected the
government's credit package to be bigger.
   ``In the immediate term, it will cast a cloud over prices. If
we're not able to grant credit in any larger quantity than
announced yesterday, the Soviet Union won't have the ability to
take its full component of exports projections in the long-term
grain agreement,'' said Jim McKinstray, manager of a large grain
elevator in Champaign County, Ill.
   The Soviet Union repeatedly has said it needs $3 billion in
credit to meet its agricultural import needs.
   ``This would have been a more welcome occurrence, the credits,
had the administration moved forward aggressively and extended
these credits last summer when producers were asking for them,''
said Chris Rink, director of the Oklahoma Wheat Commission.
   ``We've already lost competition in the European Community and
Canada, especially. Those nations extended several billions of
dollars of credits to the Soviet Union within the last few months
and have already made substantial sales of wheat,'' Rink said.
   Although it should have happened months ago, the action at least
puts the United States back in the marketplace, said Dean Kleckner,
a Rudd, Iowa, farmer who heads the American Farm Bureau Federation,
the nations largest farm group. The group represents nearly 4
million farm families.
   ``It's not going to be the great shot in the arm that some
American farmers expected,'' Kleckner said.
   Don Hutchens of the Nebraska Corn Board also criticized the $1
billion limit.
   ``That is not enough in our understanding of what the Soviets
need and it's not enough to get us up to the level of what we were
previously selling to the Soviet Union,'' Hutchens said.
   Last year at this time, 6 million metric tons of corn had been
sold to the Soviet Union, he said. So far this year, sales total
420,000 tons, he said.
   Analysts said the soybean and corn markets also showed
disappointment at the size of the package. Soybeans dropped 10
cents to 12 cents and corn about 3 to 4 cents.
   ``(But) soybean and corn prices should respond favorably to the
news,'' said Jim Nichols, Minnesota agriculture commissioner.
   Wheat producers fear the Soviets might concentrate on soybean
meal and corn because of their need for high-protein livestock feed
and their earlier wheat purchases from other exporting countries.
   On the bright side, some said the announcement bodes well for
the future.
   ``This sends a strong message to the people of the United States
that the Bush administration is going to push for trade with the
Soviets and help them become valid trading partners,'' said Rick
Perry, Texas agriculture commissioner-elect.
   Don Ethridge, a Texas Tech University agricultural economist,
said the anticipated grain sales will help work off surpluses and
depending on what is bought, eventually increase market prices.
   But he issued a warning.
   ``In the long term, we can't continue to sell them grain on
credit,'' he said. ``They will eventually wind up with a heavier
debt load than they can stand.''

   President Bush, welcoming former Persian Gulf
hostages to the White House on Thursday, sharply rejected any
suggestion that Iraq's Saddam Hussein should get a reward for
letting them go.
   ``Hell, no. Not one thing,'' Bush said. ``You don't reward a
kidnapper. You don't reward somebody who has done something he
shouldn't have done in the first place.''
   Asked if he expected to be able to defuse the tensions in the
Persian Gulf, Bush snapped, ``One way or another we will.''
   The president met with seven newly released hostages as 32 of
their countrymen left the Persian Gulf on what could be the last
charter out. He said stories told by returning hostages have
demonstrated the brutality of Saddam's actions.
   ``What this man put the world through - I just can't express it.
And I think you all expressed it coming home with a clarity that
has brought this home to the American people,'' Bush said.
   He said after the hour-long meeting, `It was a very moving
experience. A lot of people who showed a lot of support for what
we're doing.''
   The hostages included one man who hid within the U.S. Embassy
compound in Kuwait, four who had been used as ``human shields'' at
sensitive Iraqi installations and two who had been in hiding in
Kuwait.
   Also on Thursday in Washington:
   - Defense Secretary Dick Cheney stressed that Saddam's release
of the hostages brought with it no indication the Iraqi president
would pull his troops out of occupied Kuwait.
   Cheney said Saddam ``continues to deploy more forces to Kuwait
and southern Iraq. Every indication is he intends to continue his
illegal occupation of Kuwait.'' Cheney made his comments to
reporters after speaking at the National War College.
   - U.S. District Judge Harold Greene denied a request by 54
Democratic members of Congress for an injunction to force the
president to seek a declaration of war before launching an attack
on Iraqi troops in Kuwait.
   The judge said the Constitution requires a president to gain
such authorization before launching an actual attack, but he said
the case was premature since a majority of Congress had not
expressed a view on a possible attack and because Bush ``has not
shown a commitment to a definitive course of action.''
   - The Air Force said it is sending more U.S. warplanes to Saudi
Arabia from Germany and Britain, and the Navy announced the
activation of hundreds of reservists for medical duty in the gulf
area.
   Also, the Pentagon said Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will travel to Saudi Arabia
next Tuesday to visit American troops and to meet with Saudi
government officials.
   Two former hostages spoke with reporters after the meeting with
Bush and said the group supported his handling of the gulf
situation.
   ``To a man, we were in agreement with the care and the diligence
which is being taken by the president,'' said Ralph Montgomery, 56.
   Montgomery, an architect from Indian Rocks Beach, Fla., said he
hid with his son-in-law, who was a teacher at the American school
in Kuwait. He praised their Palestinian neighbors for protecting
them.
   Antonio Mireles, who had stayed at the embassy compound, said
the hostages told Bush the Kuwaitis are a peace-loving people and
``what has happened here cannot be left unattended.''
   ``It was atrocious what occurred here,'' said Mireles, 48, who
had been working a civil engineer for the Kuwaiti government.
   The last planned U.S.-sponsored flight from Iraq arrived in
Frankfurt, Germany, carrying 94 passengers. Those on board included
the last five U.S. diplomats from the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait.
   Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and other American diplomats had
defied Iraq's order to shut down the embassy in August. Cut off
from most supplies and with their compound surrounded by Iraqi
soldiers, the embassy staff subsisted mainly on canned tuna and
boiled water from their swimming pool.
   The besieged diplomats departed only after they were satisfied
that all Americans had been given a chance to leave the country,
U.S. officials said.
   Thursday's flight was expected to be the final chartered plane
carrying foreigners from Iraq and Kuwait. An estimated 500
Americans - many of them children with dual citizenship - were
remaining in Kuwait or Iraq.
   If any of the remaining Americans later decide they want to
leave, they can fly out by a commercial Iraqi airliner, according
to the State Department.
   On Capitol Hill Thursday, former U.S. military officials joined
private defense specialists in telling the House Armed Services
Committee that an American air attack would lessen casualties at
the start of a war against Iraq.
   The officials and experts held out little hope for economic
sanctions succeeding against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Unlike his Senate counterpart, Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., who heads
the House panel, shares the Bush administration's doubts about the
effectiveness of sanctions.
   The witnesses, selected by Aspin, favored the use of military
force to oust Iraq from Kuwait, contending that sanctions will not
succeed. Aspin indicated his hopes that exploring the possibility
of attacking will help Congress make a decision about war.
   ``To be united on our goals in the gulf but divided on means
would spell disaster,'' Aspin said.
   Retired Army Col. Trevor Dupuy said, ``If we wait for sanctions
to succeed, Saddam knows we're waiting and he will outlast us.''
   Eliot Cohen of Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced
International Studies said failing to go to war would persuade
Saddam that it would be ``even easier the next time if he has
nuclear weapons.''

<HEAD>Boston City Council May Repeal Such Outdated Laws as Horse
Speeding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE PETERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soon Bostonians may be able to ride horses at top
speed without risking a $20 fine, sell certain vegetables without
peeling them first and take more than a half-pint of sea worms from
Boston Harbor with impunity.
   Equine speed limits and similarly outdated ordinances have
remained on the books in Boston despite the passage of time. Now a
City Council committee has selected some they want to lay to rest.
   ``Many of them are essential laws from the 17th century,''
Councilor Brian J. McLaughlin said Thursday. He's behind the legal
house-cleaning effort. ``Unfortunately, they're not essential laws
from this century.''
   For instance, according to Section 27 of Chapter 16 of the city
code, riders of horses that trot faster than 7 mph through city
streets are subject to a $20 speeding ticket. Others outlaw grazing
and cattle driving through the streets of Boston, punishable by a
$10 fine.
   McLaughlin said the antiquated laws are found in the City of
Boston Code, Ordinance, Chapter XVI - ``Prohibitions, Penalties and
Permits.'' It's a grab bag of ordinances, some of which duplicate
state law.
   McLaughlin heads the council Committee on Government Operations,
which targeted some 50 ordinances, about half of them laughable
anachronisms. The panel has recommended repealing, changing or
recoding them. It's now up to the City Council to vote on the
recommendations. No date for a vote has been set.
   McGlaughlin said it's possible some people may raise objections,
but he doesn't anticipate many protests.
   McLaughlin joked, though, that he's had second thoughts about
one venerable prohibition slated for repeal.
   ``One has to do with fish excess, which is basically entrails,''
he said. ``There's a prohibition here from throwing them into the
Boston Harbor.
   ``Actually, that one may make sense because of all the pollution
problems we've had. Maybe we'll have to keep that one.''

   Heavy snow fell in the southern Rockies and in the high country
to the west, with light rain and snow on the western Plains, and
rain was scattered from Mississippi to Maine.
   An upper-level weather disturbance produced heavy snow in the
northern ski areas of New Mexico from Wednesday night into early
Thursday. Totals ranged up to 10 inches at Angel Fire, with 8
inches at Red River and 7 inches at Chama and Eagle Nest.
   Snow also blanketed parts of southeastern Colorado during the
night with half a foot of new show at Cuchara.
   The same weather disturbance brought snow to the mountains of
Arizona. Totals in the White Mountains ranged up to 6 inches at the
Sunrise ski area. Flagstaff received 2 inches of snow.
   The snow over Arizona by mid morning. Snow showers continued to
produce some light snow in Colorado and New Mexico and a few rain
showers extended over the southern high Plains.
   A winter storm watch was posted through Friday for the mountains
of southwestern Colorado, where up to a foot of new snow was
possible.
   Light showers also extended from western Kansas and southeastern
Colorado to southeastern Kansas and northeastern Oklahoma at
midday. Light snow was reported in southwestern Kansas, freezing
drizzle was reported in southeastern Colorado, and sleet was
reported in northern Oklahoma.
   Showers developing along a cold front in the eastern part of the
nation were scattered from northern Mississippi through West
Virginia to northern Maine. Freezing rain was reported during the
night in north-central and northeastern Vermont.
   In the Northwest, snow showers developed along a cold front and
were scattered from eastern Washington state and western Idaho into
northeastern Nevada at midday. Up to two inches of snow had
blanketed parts of southeastern Oregon.
   Snow fell heavily at Elko, Nev., late in the morning.
   Brisk northwesterly wind ushered cold air into the south central
part of the nation. While temperatures warmed into the 70s and
lower 80s in south-central Texas, readings in northwestern Texas
were only in the 30s and lower 40s.
   Strong northwesterly wind also ushered cold air into the Great
Lakes and the Northeast. Afternoon temperatures were in the 60s
along the middle Atlantic Coast, but readings were only in the
teens and single digits in the upper Mississippi Valley.
   Cloud cover helped keep afternoon readings in the teens and 20s
in the northern Plains.
   Thursday morning lows were only in the teens and single digits
in the north central part of the nation.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 6 below zero at
Warroad, Minn.

<HEAD>HUD Plans Attack on Lead-Based Paint in Private Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp announced Friday a
national plan to eradicate lead poisoning in millions of U.S. homes
in which children are exposed to peeling lead-based paint or high
levels of lead in house dust.
   The plan includes a new financial assistance program and is
tailored to help lower-income families with children, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development said in a statement.
   The department said the proposed cost and other details of the
financial aid plan will be disclosed as part of the federal budget
for the 1992 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, 1991.
   ``We must ensure that low-income families with children have
access to public information and financial assistance to help them
protect their children from the hazards posed by lead-based
paint,'' Kemp said.
   The department said that in developing the plan it conducted a
national study which found that young children are present in about
3.8 million U.S. homes which have peeling lead-based paint or lead
in dust.
   About half of the households involved are considered lower
income, the department said.
   It said the plan involves either the removal of lead-based paint
or covering it over so it is no longer a threat to health.
   The plan to eliminate the hazard in private housing complements
HUD's ongoing efforts to do so in public housing, the department
statement said.
   Lead poisoning can lead to mental retardation and other mental
disorders. It also can damage the liver and lead to paralysis of
the extremities, sometimes followed by convulsion and collapse. Its
effects are permanent and cannot be reversed.
   HUD said other elements of the plan include proposals to:
   -Expand public education efforts to help explain the dangers of
lead and how children can be protected from it.
   -Support state and local programs to increase the number of
young children checked for lead in blood.
   -Conduct new research to reduce the cost and measure the health
benefits of removing exposure to lead.
   -Increase the capability on the part of state and local
governments and the private sector to test for and eliminate the
dangers of lead-based paint.
   The department noted that at present only two states, Maryland
and Massachusetts, have comprehensive lead-based paint abatement
programs.

<HEAD>U.S. Will Send Sterile Flies to Libya to Combat Fatal Pest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shipment of 3.5 million sterilized screwworm
flies will be sent to Libya this weekend in the kickoff of a
program to eliminate the pest from the North African country, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The sterile worms mate with natural flies but produce no
offspring, thus short-circuiting the insect's reproductive cycle.
The method has proved to be an effective biological control of the
pests in Mexico and the southern United States.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the flies come from a plant
in Tuxtla, Gutierrez, Mexico.
   The flies will be sold to the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization at cost, he said. The FAO is sponsoring and paying for
the screwworm program in Libya. The effort is expected to take two
years and eventually require aerial drops of 100 million sterile
flies a week.
   Glosser said the sale of the flies to FAO ``culminates more than
year of negotiations'' with the U.N. agency and Mexico.
   ``We recognize the sensitivity of ventures with Libya, but we
also recognize the importance of preventing the spread of
screwworms from Libya,'' Glosser said. ``Our goal is to help
protect livestock, wildlife and human health in southern Europe and
Africa from this devastating pest.''
   In its natural state, the female screwworm fly lays eggs in the
open wounds of warm-blooded animals. The developing larvae feed on
the flesh of the host, deepening the wound and attracting other
egg-laying females.
   Screwworm cases are usually fatal if left untreated and have
been known to occur in humans, Glosser said.
   The British Museum detected screwworms in Libya two years ago.
The FAO subsequently requested sterile flies from the department.
The Libyan program is expected to cost FAO about $101 million over
the two years.

   The Red Cross and the American Association of
Blood Banks each has agreed to send 375 pints of blood weekly to
the Persian Gulf, for use in treating American soldiers if needed.
   The shipments, to begin next week, are partly intended as a
rehearsal in the event that greater amounts of blood are required
later, the Red Cross said.
   The Pentagon said the shipments would provide extra blood for up
to 200,000 military personnel being sent to the gulf.
   In the event of hostilities in the region, the Red Cross and the
National Association of Blood Banks, as backups for military blood
programs, each could be asked to supply as many as 800 pints of
blood daily, officials said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has yet to decide what, if
anything, to do about a surprise Education Department ruling that
reinterprets civil rights law to bar colleges from directing
scholarships to racial minorities, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Thursday.
   A department official declared Wednesday it is illegal for
federally supported institutions to offer ``race-specific''
scholarships, a policy shift that drew immediate fire from
educators and civil rights leaders.
   Fitzwater confirmed the White House was not consulted on the
issue. ``Obviously we like to know in advance of decisions that
have wide repercussions, but we didn't,'' he said. ``That's the way
it happens.''
   Asked if President Bush, a longtime supporter of the United
Negro College Fund, would direct the Justice Department to appeal
the ruling, Fitzwater said, ``we don't have an opinion at this
time. We haven't had a chance to look at it.''
   He said Bush supports various affirmative action programs but
opposes racial quotas. ``This is a kind of an in-between case that
is not clear exactly ... what it means.''
   Michael L. Williams, the Education Department's assistant
secretary for Civil Rights, said Wednesday he had warned officials
of the Fiesta Bowl about their offer of $100,000 each in minority
scholarships to the universities of Louisville and Alabama if their
football teams play in the game.
   He said in a Dec. 4 letter to bowl officials that ``Title Six
(of the 1964 Civil Rights Act) prohibits discrimination on the
ground of race, color, or national origin in any program or
activity receiving federal financial assistance.''
   Fiesta Bowl officials made the offer after Arizona voters
rejected a holiday honoring the late civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr., prompting threatened boycotts of Arizona sports
events by the National Football League and universities.
   Richard Rosser, president of the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities, said the ruling puts
universities in a ``catch-22'' situation where federally funded
programs and private grants for minorities are permitted but
institutions are not allowed to operate their own programs.
   He said his organization has asked for an immediate meeting with
Education Department officials, ``and if we can't get it resolved
at that level we hope to go to the White House.''
   The office of Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Cal., chairman of the
House Education and Labor Committee, said hearings on the issue
will be held next Wednesday.
   ``I have a problem with the department threatening something
that has been in existence for decades,'' said Rep. William D.
Ford, D-Mich., a member of the education committee. ``We will be
taking a closer look at just what the administration has in mind
and what the implications are.''
   David R. Owitz, spokesman for the American Council on Education,
said there is no accurate estimate of how many programs might be
affected if the ban is imposed, but that it could have
``significant impact'' on efforts by graduate schools to recruit
more minority students.
   ``If you want to produce minority scientists and mathematicians
you are going to have to find a way to give them adequate
funding,'' he said.
   ``To say we are appalled is to understate our position,'' said
NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks. ``We are, in fact,
incensed at the insensitivity, callousness, and quite frankly, the
illogic of such a ruling.''
   Williams said his department has been handling complaints about
race-exclusive scholarships on a case-by-case basis, but now is
working to ``set a policy that will work across the board.''
   He said race could be considered a positive factor in offering
scholarships among similarly qualified individuals ``if the
institution is one where there has been limited participation of a
particular race.''

   Communist Albania on Thursday ordered
soldiers to quell an attack on officials and buildings by
``hooligans'' armed with knives, stones and iron bars, that
country's official media reported.
   The attacks in the northern city of Shkodra came one day after a
peaceful rally by tens of thousands of people in the capital,
Tirana, celebrating the founding of the country's first
non-Communist party, the Democratic Party of Albania.
   Journalists said Tirana, about 80 miles south of Shkodra,
remained calm Thursday.
   Official reports said attackers with knives and iron bars
assaulted the local police chief and two other policemen in the
city of Shkodra.
   Official Albanian Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corp. in London, said gangs were ``throwing stones at the district
party and government buildings, and committing acts of vandalism
inside the local radio station.''
   ``In order to reimpose order and calm in the city and to defend
government and social institutions, the forces of public order and
the army came into action,'' it said.
   A later ATA report said the rioters were ``without any political
aims.'' However, the attacks suggest that tension in the small,
isolated Balkan country was unlikely to die down, despite official
concessions during a week of protests.
   Albania, with the last Stalinist government in Europe, has for
decades kept a tight lid on protest but allowed limited reforms in
past months. In July, thousands of people jammed foreign embassies
in Tirana until they were permitted to emigrate.
   A journalist of the official ATA news agency, contacted by
telephone in Tirana, said Thursday's reports were read on both the
official radio and television. The journalist spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Such quick reporting is new for Albania. Information, especially
about protests against the government and party authorities, has
been tightly controlled for decades.
   It was not clear whether the army was forced to use weapons or
how many attackers there were. There was no immediate indication
whether the situation was under control late Thursday.
   The official report said that despite President Ramiz Alia's
appeal for calm Wednesday, there were ``certain dark forces which
seek to destabilize the situation in the country.''
   In Tirana, meanwhile, organizers of the country's first
non-Communist party were working on a program calling for human
rights and privatization of the suffering economy.
   Gramoz Pashko, a Tirana university economist involved with the
new party, said students, intellectuals and others hoped to present
a formal program and statutes within ``a couple of days.''
   Pashko, in a telephone interview from Tirana, said the new party
sought to implement human rights as outlined in the Helsinki Final
Act and subsequent documents and to open up the economy to private
and foreign investment.
   He said the group hoped to present its platform as soon as
possible to enable authorities to register the new party.
   The ruling Communist Party surprisingly reversed itself Tuesday
and agreed to permit alternative political organizations. However,
it has not firmly stated it will relinquish its constitutional
monopoly on power.
   Pashko noted that Parliament also will have to pass a law on
registering political parties.
   A journalist for the state news agency ATA said it was expected
the new party would be registered quickly because its program ``is
very good for the people.''
   Alia warned Albanians late Wednesday that if they followed
demagogues ``the country threatens to be destabilized and cast into
anarchy.''
   Before Tuesday, the Communists had said they would allow more
than one person to run for each parliamentary seat, but would not
permit political pluralism. The Communists also had rejected the
kind of far-reaching changes that led to the fall of Communist
governments in the rest of Eastern Europe.
   The concession Tuesday followed three days of student
anti-government protests in Tirana.
   Wage increases were promised earlier this year, but Albanians
say they have not materialized. Even the promises afforded only
temporary respite from the leaders' basic dilemma: how to make the
changes needed to get the economy going while retaining control and
avoiding open rebellion.

<TEXT>
   Two researchers who analyzed the chemistry of
deposits at a proposed nuclear waste dump in Nevada said they
believe the site hasn't been affected by rising ground water for
more than 300,000 years.
   Thure E. Cerling, a University of Utah geologist, said the
findings suggest that Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada would make
a site where the nation's highly radioactive nuclear wastes could
be deposited without fear of polluting underground waters.
   ``These findings provide no evidence of rising ground water at
the site,'' Cerling said. ``I can't say positively that this would
never happen, but this study certainly provides no evidence for
such a scenario.''
   As a result, he said, Yucca Mountain ``looks a lot better than a
lot of other places'' as a safe, stable place to store radioactive
nuclear wastes. But he cautioned that ``there is still a lot of
work to be done'' before the geology in the area is fully
understood.
   Yucca Mountain has been chosen by the federal government as the
primary candidate site for a nuclear waste dump.
   Among the reasons it was selected is that preliminary studies
showed it appeared to be unlikely that ground water would flood a
waste repository installed 450 feet underground in the area.
   A series of test trenches have been dug across faults near Yucca
Mountain. In one of them, trench 14, experts found a network of
carbonate veins, a mineral deposit often associated with water.
   Some experts have said the minerals were deposited during the
last Ice Age, which ended about 12,000 years ago, when ground water
rose to an level that would fill the proposed underground nuclear
dump.
   But Cerling and Jay Quade, also of Utah, say the deposits are
much, much older.
   In the current issue of the journal Science, the researchers
said the carbonates in trench 14 were deposited thousands of years
before the last Ice Age and that ground water has not risen to the
level of the proposed nuclear repository for more than 300,000
years.
   The carbonates, Cerling said, ``were formed in the soil or by
soil-forming processes. The important point is that they would have
formed in the unsaturated zone, which means there is not permanent
water there.''
   Cerling said that means that the deposit of nuclear wastes at
the Yucca Mountain site is less likely to pollute underground
water.
   The deposits in trench 14, he said, bear the chemical signature
of carbonate produced by the local vegetation. He said modern soils
nearby have a similar carbon signature, and that other evidence
shows that vegetation in the area at the time of the trench 14
deposits was similar to the modern day plants.
   When carbonate is created by ground water, as some scientists
suggest for trench 14, the mineral shows the chemical signature of
limestone, Cerling said. He said his analysis of the Yucca Mountain
carbonate shows no signature of limestone.
   ``What this implies is that these particular carbonates have no
evidence of being associated with rising ground water,'' Cerling
said.
   Robert Loux of the Nevada Nuclear Waste Project Office said that
the Utah researchers' conclusion is highly controversial.
   ``The data ... has been countered by a number of other
scientists who suggest that those deposits can only be made by
uplifting of hydrothermal waters from the subsurface,'' Loux said.
   ``There is as much data that suggests it was formed by
subsurface processes as there is that suggests it formed by
precipitation processes,'' he said.
   Cerling conceded that there is a disagreement among scientists
on the issues and said that more work is needed before there is a
consensus.

   Workers struggled to shore up three homes
that were sinking deeper into the earth Thursday after an abandoned
coal mine collapsed.
   Two homes sank 3 feet within hours after homeowners first
noticed the popping and cracking that heralded the mine subsidence
Wednesday.
   There were no injuries but police evacuated six homes overnight.
Residents on Thursday were allowed to move back into all but two of
the homes.
   Kelly Caringer and Chad Smith were practicing music in Smith's
basement when they noticed the noises, said Caringer's father, Ken
Caringer.
   ``My son said it was like labor pains. They got closer and
closer together and more extreme,'' said Caringer, who lives a
block away in the southern Illinois town of about 9,600.
   ``It was a little like you were in the middle of an earthquake,
but nothing but the house was moving,'' said Caringer, who helped
the Smiths move their furniture from the home.
   The Smith home tilted noticeably to one side and had separated
about 6 inches from its garage.
   A second home, belonging to J.C. and Carolyn Garavalia, listed
backwards markedly.
   Workers drained about 175,000 gallons of water from a water
tower beside the Smith home, fearing the tower might collapse, said
Bob Gibson of the Illinois Abandoned Mined Lands Reclamation
Council.
   Water from a main that broke during the collapse flooded the
back yards of the two homes and poured into part of an 8-foot deep
gash in the ground that ringed the perimeter of the 300-foot by
300-foot sag, Gibson said.
   It took workers about 24 hours to stop the leak.
   Steel beams were installed under the three homes on the edge of
the sag to prevent cracking as the homes sink further, Gibson said.
   ``It's a mess,'' said resident Maxine Smith as she and her
husband, Kenneth, inspected the hairline cracks that snaked along
the walls and floors of the house.
   ``It's terrible. It makes me sick to think about it,'' Mr. Smith
said.
   The $100,000 homes, which are all insured against mine
subsidence, are safe to live in and will be repaired after the
earth stops moving, Gibson said.
   He estimated that the ground would sink another 4 to 5 inches
over the next year. The mine, which runs about 120 feet
underground, was abandoned in 1925 by the Franklin County Coal Co.
   One resident, who would not give his name or comment, remained
in the third home. It sustained only minor cracking, but Gibson
predicted that it would sink further and would have been severely
damaged without the steel supports.
   There is no way to predict when a mine will collapse. Usually it
is caused when the clay floor or a ceiling support buckles, he
said.
   Experts don't know what causes the buckling.
   ``We are fighting the unknown here,'' Gibson said.

   ``We prayed a lot,'' said Wayne Cox.
   The 40-year-old Cox and his Kuwaiti-born wife, Layla, said
prayer and worry were their major occupations during their four
months in hiding in Kuwait after the Iraqi invasion on Aug. 2.
   The Coxes and their three young children had moved to Kuwait on
June 15, she to use her master's degree in public health to work
for the government, he to take a job with Kuwait television as an
electronics technician.
   The Iraqi invasion turned their lives inside out. Cox never left
the house, a hiding place was prepared within, elaborate lies were
developed about who Mrs. Cox was married to. And the children, the
rare times they were let out to play in the yard, were not allowed
to speak English.
   On Thursday, the Coxes left the chaos behind and flew to
Frankfurt on the last scheduled evacuation flight of foreigners,
led by U.S. Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and other embassy staff.
   In brief comments to reporters, Howell at first said he had
``closed'' the embassy but then caught himself, saying he ``did not
close the embassy, but I vacated it. The flag flies.''
   Howell looked a bit thinner from the ordeal, and his gray hair
had grown long. After retrieving his luggage, Howell said he had
lost ``a little'' weight on the siege diet, which featured canned
tuna and boiled water from the embassy swimming pool.
   Asked if the embassy staff had endured, as reported, on a diet
of tuna sandwiches, Howell deadpanned: ``No, the bread ran out.''
   Howell declined to speak at length, saying, ``We haven't had
electricity and water, hot water, at night for 110 days. So, we're
going to take advantage of that.''
   Iraqi officials only began allowing in fresh supplies during the
final two weeks of the standoff, which began shortly after Iraq
invaded Kuwait.
   ``It's terrible, you had to be there. Everything is trash,''
Mrs. Cox said of the occupied emirate. She looked nervous and gaunt
as she collected belongings in Frankfurt airport and cared for
daughter Miriam, 6, son Jassim, 7, and cradled 11-month-old Rachel
in her arms.
   ``I felt the freedom when I came here, and I thought of my
sisters there, because I had said goodbye to them,'' she said.
   ``When I landed here and the hostages shouted in the airplane
with happiness - it's not happiness for me,'' she said. ``My poor
sisters and their kids are still hostages there. I don't think I'll
be able to enjoy this freedom.''
   She said Iraqis stole a new Volvo from one of her three sisters
in Kuwait, and Iraqi authorities reacted to her complaint with
threats.
   ``When my sister started to report that stolen car, the officer
said to the soldiers, `Arrest her,''' Mrs. Cox said.
   She was one of several Kuwait-born women who had to accept Iraqi
passports before they could join the evacuation flight.
   Cox said that Kuwaitis ``have to change their passports, they
had to change their licenses to buy gas. Maybe they'll have to
change their citizenship so they can buy food.''
   Asked what his wife would do with her Iraqi passport, he
replied, ``Burn it, throw it away.''
   Mrs. Cox was adamant in rejecting the view that economic
sanctions should be given more time to work to force Iraq out of
Kuwait.
   After they join her husband's parents in Orlando, Fla., they
plan to work for Kuwaiti freedom, she said.
   Cox said, ``God bless George Bush and the rest of the people
that are behind him, and give them the stamina to stick it out.''

   A 58-year-old Israeli man wounded in a border
attack by an Egyptian gunman last month died on Thursday, hospital
officials said.
   Leon Ben Abo, who suffered a fractured pelvis from a bullet
wound, died ``very suddenly'' of unknown causes at Yoseftal
Hospital in the port of Eilat, said Dr. Ido Olsha, the hospital
director.
   Olsha said an autopsy probably would be conducted.
   Four other Israelis were killed in the Nov. 25 ambush north of
Eilat in one of the worst incidents along their frontier since
Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty in 1979.
   An Egyptian border policeman was apprehended in Egypt shortly
after the attack and has been held since as a key suspect.
   In Tel Aviv, army Col. Yaacov Sadeh was convicted of causing
``death by negligence'' of a 15-year-old Palestinian boy while
firing plastic bullets at stone-throwers at Bureij refugee camp in
the Gaza Strip in July 1989, the army and Israeli reports said.
   Mahmoud Saraj was fatally wounded in the neck in the shooting by
Sadeh, then a deputy commander in the area.
   The army tribunal said Sadeh violated open-fire regulations, the
army said. He is to be sentenced in January.
   Israel radio said the tribunal rejected Sadeh's claim he was in
a life-threatening situation when he fired after a bus was stoned
near Bureij.
   He also illegally aimed at Saraj's arm, instead of toward the
lower part of the body, the judges reportedly ruled.
   A 16-year-old Israeli Arab stabbed and slightly wounded a
soldier and a civilian with a small blade in Petach Tikvah on
Thursday, apparently after arguing with the trooper, police said.
   The boy was ordered held for questioning and investigators are
checking whether he acted on nationalist or pro-Palestinian
motives, Zeev Even-Chen, a spokesman for Sharon district police,
said.
   Israeli reports quoted the youth as saying he struck out in
anger after the soldier verbally abused him.
   In the occupied territories, soldiers shot and wounded at least
four Palestinians during numerous stone-throwing incidents, the
army and reports said.
   Three of the Arabs were ambushed while throwing rocks at Israeli
vehicles, by specially assigned military sharpshooters, the army
said.
   An Israeli woman was reportedly hospitalized with a chest wound
from a stone thrown at a bus Thursday in Gaza.

<TEXT>
   A moderate earthquake shook eastern
Sicily early Thursday, killing 19 people and injuring about 200,
panicking thousands and destroying part of a small town, officials
said.
   Worst hit was Carlentini, a town of 10,000 people between
Catania and Syracuse, where members of five families were killed
when their homes crumbled on top of them as they slept.
   The quake struck at about 1:30 a.m. (5:30 p.m. Wednesday EST)
and registered 4.7 on the Richter scale, the Ministry of Civil
Protection reported. It was followed by dozens of aftershocks
during the day.
   ``There was a huge roar all of a sudden. Everything shook,''
said Sebastiano Valvo, an employee at the Syracuse prefect's
office.
   The bodies of 13 people were pulled from the rubble in
Carlentini. They included two elderly couples; a woman, her two
daughters and two grandchildren; a 32-year-old bar owner; and a
couple and their 18-month-old daughter.
   The bar owner's wife died of her injuries in the hospital in
Lentini.
   In addition, four elderly people from the Catania area and one
person from Niscemi, west of Syracuse, died of heart attacks after
the quake, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   A rescue worker in Carlentini told ANSA that he found the bodies
of Sebastiano Musumeci, his wife Francesca and their 18-month-old
daughter Veronica together.
   ``They're all hugging in a big bed,'' the unidentified worker
was quoted as saying. ``Maybe they were in such a deep sleep that
they didn't even understand what happened. Let's hope it was like
that.''
   The couple's 5-year-old son Rosario escaped.
   About 200 people were injured, the Italian news agency AGI said.
The quake caused at least $400 million in damage, according to the
prefect's office in Syracuse.
   Up to 2,500 people were left homeless by the quake, said the
Civil Protection Ministry.
   Rescue crews dug through wreckage under a driving rain to try to
find survivors.
   In Carlentini, officials said they would set up a huge tent on
the village sports field to shelter some of the 1,300 people left
homeless. Two neighborhoods were badly damaged and at least five
people were seriously injured.
   In other cities and towns along the coast, chunks of concrete
were shaken off buildings and hurled into the streets.
   Numerous churches were declared unsafe and closed. Prisoners
from a jail in the town of Noto were transferred to other
facilities after they spent much of the frigid, rainy hours after
the quake sleeping in the prison courtyard.
   The mayor of Syracuse, Gaetano Bandiera, asked the region's
prefect to proclaim a state of emergency.
   The quake's epicenter was in the Gulf of Noto about 30 miles
southeast of Syracuse, said the National Institute of Geophysics.
   Local and regional authorities rushed to find shelter for those
unable to return to their shaky dwellings.
   In the city of Augusta, the mayor requisitioned a holiday
village to provide dwellings for 1,500 people. In Catania, a
visiting circus made available its heated tent for victims of the
earthquake.
   The mayor of Priolo, working with local businesses, dished out
hot meals for those in need.
   Police reported a few cases of looting in areas hit by the
earthquake. Two men were arrested in Carlentini on robbery charges.
   Sicily, an island just west of the Italian mainland's toe, has
been struck several times by major earthquakes.
   In 1968, nearly 400 people died in a quake. In 1908, a quake
leveled the city of Messina, killing 83,000 people.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   An earthquake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage, while a
quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage.

   The White House said Thursday that Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos is entitled to characterize his departure
from the Cabinet any way he wishes. Sources said he resigned only
after being told that President Bush wanted him to leave.
   ``You can interpret this thing any way you want,'' presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   He acknowledged that White House Chief of Staff John Sununu had
talked with Cavazos about his plans for running the department.
``But he submitted his resignation. And, frankly, he deserves to
have his president and the president's spokesman commend him for
the work that he's done in the last two year.''
   Fitzwater said he would not comment on the circumstances of
Cavazos' resignation, which occurred Wednesday.
   ``Dignity, I think, suggests that he has the right to
characterize that departure in any way he wants to, and I'll leave
it to him,'' Fitzwater said.

   An 11-year-old environmentalist whose campaign
against pollution included a letter to President Bush that was
plastered on billboards was rewarded for her efforts Thursday with
a presidential citation.
   Melissa Poe, from Nashville, Tenn., received a presidential
environmental youth award from the Environmental Protection Agency
during the EPA's regional awards ceremony and 20th anniversary
celebration in Atlanta.
   Melissa first gained attention in September 1989, when she
talked outdoor advertising companies in Nashville and Washington,
D.C., into displaying a letter she had written to Bush on
billboards.
   She wrote to Bush after watching a bleak vision of the future in
20 years on the TV show ``Highway to Heaven.''
   ``I wrote him because I'm afraid to die young. I saw on
television all the bad things that can happen if we don't take care
of our environment,'' the fifth-grader said upon receiving the
award Thursday.
   Bush did not reply to Melissa's letter, but a followup letter to
Barbara Bush did bring a response from the first lady, said EPA
spokesman Hagan Thompson.

<HEAD>EC To Approve Aid Package for Soviets, Renew Demand for Iraqi
Withdrawal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community will vote on a $2.4 billion
aid package for the Soviet Union at a summit this weekend and will
renew demands for Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait,
Italian delegates said Thursday.
   On the eve of the two-day meeting in Rome, President Bush sent a
letter to Italy, now EC president, urging the Europeans to stand
firm against Iraq.
   ``For us, the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait must happen without
conditions,'' said Premier Giulio Andreotti's spokesman, Pio
Mastrobuoni.
   He said European leaders were unmoved by Iraq's release of
Western hostages and would issue a declaration in line with their
previous statements demanding Iraq abide by U.N. resolutions.
   The meeting starting Saturday is also expected to launch the
12-nation trading bloc on a radical path of political and economic
union.
   British Prime Minister John Major will make his international
debut. EC officials hope Major will be more open to European
integration than his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher.
   Her isolation at an EC summit in Rome in October was a main
factor leading to her forced resignation after 11 years in power.
   ``We will miss Mrs. Thatcher because she was the only woman
sitting with us,'' Mastrobuoni told a news conference. ``But I can
only say that in the preparation phase there has been active
cooperation from the British side.''
   A proposed $2.4 billion food and economic aid package to the
Soviet Union will top the agenda.
   The proposal by the Community's executive body, the European
Commission, envisages $1 billion in food aid for 1991 - one-third
in grants and two-thirds in guaranteed credits. The rest would
consist of technical help for 1991 and 1992.
   Bush said Wednesday the United States would provide $1.3 billion
in loan guarantees for the Soviets to buy U.S. farm products and
manufactured goods.
   Despite Italian confidence that the EC will approve the Soviet
aid, the issue remains controversial. Some member states argue
Moscow will never be able to repay the loans and that help should
focus on the chaotic Soviet distribution system, not on handouts.
   The European leaders will also consider aid to the new
democracies of Eastern Europe. The European Commission says
Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, as well as
Yugoslavia, will need $5.5 billion in extra financing next year.
   On Saturday, the summit will inaugurate two intergovernmental
conferences to fashion treaties for monetary, economic and
political union.
   Calls for a common defense have increased since the Persian Gulf
crisis. Only Britain and France, for example, have sent ground
forces to the gulf.
   But not all EC governments are ready to talk about a joint
defense policy. Britain fears undermining the role in Europe of the
U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization, while one community
nation, Ireland, is neutral.

   A federal judge Thursday rejected a request by
Democratic lawmakers to bar President Bush from attacking Iraqi
forces without Congress' permission, saying the motion was
premature.
   But U.S. District Jude Harold H. Greene held that Congress must
authorize an actual attack and said that under different
circumstances he would bar a president from unilaterally sending
U.S. troops to war.
   In denying a motion by 54 Democrats for a preliminary
injunction, Greene said the issue was not ``ripe'' because a
majority of Congress hasn't expressed its view on a possible attack
and Bush ``has not shown a commitment to a definitive course of
action.''
   Separately, another federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by an Army
National Guard reservist who challenged Bush's power to send him to
the Middle East without congressional approval.
   The legal doctrine that courts cannot make a decision unless an
issue is ``ripe,'' or ready for adjudication, was key to Greene's
holding on the lawmakers' request for an injunction barring a U.S.
attack without Bush asking Congress for approval.
   ``Unless Congress as a whole, or by a majority, is heard from,
the controversy here cannot be deemed ripe,'' Greene said.
   Until then, he said, Bush ``is entitled to be protected from an
injunctive order respecting a declaration of war.''
   But such an injunction could be granted if a majority of
lawmakers said Bush should seek congressional authority and the
president was ``clearly committed to early military operations
amounting to war in the constitutional sense,'' said Greene, an
appointee of President Carter.
   ``The court has no hesitation in concluding that an offensive
entry into Iraq by several hundred thousand United States
servicemen ... could be described as `war''' under the war-powers
clause of the Constitution.
   ``To put it another way: The court is not prepared to read out
of the Constitution the clause granting to the Congress, and to it
alone, the authority to `declare war,''' Greene said in a 29-page
opinion.
   Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, the California Democrat who organized
the lawsuit, called Greene's decision `` a victory for the American
people.''
   ``The court has put the president on notice that he must obtain
prior consent from the Congress before he initiates an action
against Iraq,'' Dellums said in a statement.
   But Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Gerson, who argued the
case for the Bush administration, also claimed victory, saying
Greene's decision imposes ``no limit on the president's
prerogatives.''
   Several lawyers familiar with the case said the ``ripeness''
test could be met if a majority of lawmakers joined the lawsuit or
Congress passed a resolution stating that Bush must seek its
authority to launch an attack.
   Reps. Charles E. Bennett, D-Fla., and Richard J. Durbin,
D.-Ill., plan to introduce a concurrent resolution when Congress
returns in January stating that Congress must authorize an
offensive war in the Persian Gulf.
   Greene's analysis differed from that used by his colleague, U.S.
District Judge Royce C. Lamberth, to dismiss the lawsuit by Sgt.
Michael R. Ange, a student and former North Carolina policeman who
was sent to the Middle East last month when his reserve unit was
called up.
   Lamberth, an appointee of President Reagan, held that courts are
``neither equipped nor empowered to intrude into the realm of
foreign affairs where the Constitution grants operational powers to
the two political branches'' of government.
   Greene ruled in the lawmakers' case, however that ``while the
Constitution grants to the political branches, and in particular to
the executive, responsibility for conducting the nation's foreign
affairs, it does not follow that judicial power is excluded from
the resolution of cases merely because they may touch upon such
affairs.''
   Greene also rejected as ``far too sweeping'' the Justice
Dpartment's argument that courts are incompetent to decide if the
nation is at war.
   ``If the executive had the sole power to determine that any
particular offensive military operation, no matter how vast, does
not constitute war-making but only an offensive military attack,
the congressional power to declare war will be at the mercy of a
semantic decision by the executive,'' Greene said.
   Michael Ratner, an attorney for the Center for Constitutional
Rights, which brought both the lawsuits decided Thursday, said he
was pleased that Greene found that courts can enforce the
war-powers clause.
   ``He basically affirmed Congress's power to be the body that
gets us into a war,'' Ratner said. ``It's basically telling the
president he can't do what he is going to do without getting
Congress to agree beforehand.''
   Another lawyer, Jules Lobel, said members of Congress would
study the opinion before deciding whether to appeal the case.

<HEAD>Tribal Judge Refuses To Make Son Testify Against Father</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of suspended Navajo Chairman
Peter McDonald will not be forced to testify against his father
during their tribal trial on charges related to the purchase of a
ranch.
   Special prosecutors asked tribal Judge Robert Yazzie to dismiss
a single count of conspiracy against Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr.
and to compel him to testify.
   The judge did not explain his reasons for rejecting the request.
   Father and son are on trial on charges related to the tribe's
purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch for $33.4 million, only hours
after a third party had bought it for $26.25 million.
   The elder MacDonald is charged with one count each of bribery,
fraud and conspiracy and 10 ethics violations related to the
tribe's purchase of the northern Arizona ranch in 1987.
   His son faces only the one count of conspiracy.
   A federal grand jury in Phoenix has been investigating matters
related to the MacDonald administration. Neither MacDonald has been
charged in federal court.
   U.S. Attorney Wallace Kleindienst said in an interview Thursday
he couldn't comment on grand jury proceedings, which are secret.
   The tribal council suspended MacDonald as chairman in February
1989 after a U.S. Senate committee hearing. At the hearing, Rocky
MacDonald and others testified that McDonald accepted cash payments
and other favors from people doing business with the tribe.
   The MacDonalds were convicted Oct. 17 in tribal court of
bribery, conspiracy and ethics violations. That trial involved
allegations that the tribal chairman took bribes and kickbacks from
businessmen operating on the reservation.
   The elder MacDonald is also scheduled for trial Jan. 16 in
tribal court on election fraud charges.

<HEAD>Hindu-Moslem Violence Shakes India</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Hindu mob stabbed to death a Moslem
man and woman riding a motorcycle in this southern Indian town
Thursday, witnesses said.
   They said the mob forcibly stopped the couple, aged 30 to 35,
and then knifed them. The two were easily recognizable as Moslems
because the wife wore the traditional veil over her face while
outside her home.
   At least seven other people, including five women, died in
continuing Hindu-Moslem clashes and incidents of arson and looting
in Hyderabad since Wednesday night. Seven days of violence killed
at least 137 people here.
   Nationwide, at least 235 people have been killed in stabbings in
five cities or more cities after Hindu fundamentalists revived a
campaign to build a temple that would replace a mosque in the
remote northern town of Ayodhya.
   Women, old men and at least 28 children were among the victims
in Hyderabad, a city of 2 million people. Most were knifed or axed
to death.
   In Kanpur, 620 miles north of Hyderabad, Press Trust of India
said two men died of injuries Thursday, raising the death toll
there to eight, and two people were wounded in separate incidents
of shooting and stabbing.
   It said two people were shot to death in Meerut, 230 miles
northwest of Kanpur.
   In Ahmedabad, 530 miles northwest of Hyderabad, 60 people were
wounded in stabbings and 20 people received gunshot wounds when
police fired to control angry mobs, United News of India said.
   A mob in Hyderabad stabbed a 70-year-old Moslem woman to death
and then ransacked her house. A younger woman in the house was
badly wounded. In another incident, a 55-year-old Moslem woman was
stabbed and burned alive.
   A curfew imposed Dec. 7 on Hyderabad was lifted for two hours
Thursday afternoon. Police fired at curfew violators. Police said a
police patrol killed a man seen lurking around a neighborhood.
   Moslems beat two Hindus to death during the time the curfew was
eased. Hospital Superintendent K.V. Naidu said 25 people were
brought to the government-run hospital with knife wounds Thursday.
   The seven days of arson, looting and killing in Hyderabad is the
worst single outbreak of sectarian violence in India since the
temple uproar began in October. Hindu-Moslem riots killed at least
380 people nationwide in October and November.
   Hindu fundamentalists claim a 16th-century mosque in Ayodhya was
built on the ruins of a Hindu temple. Moslems deny it.
Archaeologists and historians are divided over the issue. Ayodhya
lies 310 miles east of New Delhi.
   Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people. Hindus
comprise 82 percent.

<BYLINE>Progress Reported in Angola Talks
^By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of the two warring factions in
Angola met Thursday with three outside mediators and a joint
statement issued afterward reported ``significant progress'' toward
reaching a cease-fire in the country's civil war.
   Joining the Angolans at the talks were officials from the United
States, the Soviet Union and Portugal, the former colonial power in
Angola and site of the five rounds of peace talks held thus far
this year.
   ``We believe that significant progress has been made, and that
the prospects for a successful sixth round of negotiations in
Lisbon early next year have been enhanced,'' the joint statement
said.
   The statement said the delegates were favorably impressed by the
friendliness of the atmosphere created by the two Angolan parties
as well as by the seriousness of their approach to the
negotiations.
   The U.S., Soviet and Portuguese participants held a news
conference late Thursday, but declined to cite the areas in which
progress was made. They also said the discussion was an exchange of
views rather than a negotiating session.
   Herman Cohen, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, said that the ``main point of agreement'' is that Angola's
leftist government is now willing to implement constitutional
changes that will convert the country from a one-party Marxist
state to a multiparty democracy. This was agreed to at a party
congress this past weekend.
   The Portuguese representative, Antonio Monteiro, said an
``enormous gap of confidence'' has existed between the two factions
but that this problem is being overcome.
   The United States and the Soviet Union have been arming opposite
sides in the conflict but have agreed to stop weapons shipments
once a cease-fire agreement is reached. The war has dragged on for
15 years and killed hundreds of thousands of Angolans.
   The leader of the Angolan rebel movement, Jonas Savimbi, said
Thursday after a meeting with President Bush that peace prospects
have improved as a result of joint efforts by the superpowers.
   ``I think both the United States and the Soviet Union are
joining hands in trying to find a solution to the Angolan
problem,'' Savimbi said after a 20-minute meeting with Bush, during
which he thanked the president for U.S. support for his forces.
   He said his goal is a truce in early 1991 and free and fair
elections by the end of the year. He said the rival factions in
Angola are close to a settlement.
   But Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos has said that free
elections are not advisable over the next three years because of
preparations required for the transition, including voter
registration and clearing oads of mines.
   After the White House meeting, Bush's spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater, said Bush had ``reaffirmed to Dr. Savimbi the United
States support for his movement, and to express his hope that the
current negotiations will lead to a cease-fire and a peaceful
settlement in Angola.''
   Asked if the United States would keep supplying arms to the
UNITA rebels, Fitzwater said only, ``We're very hopeful that a
peaceful settlement of this will be reached soon and there will be
no need for armed conflict.''

<HEAD>FDA Panel Recommends Drug That Aids Bone Marrow Therapy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel
recommended approval Thursday of a new drug that enhances bone
marrow transplant treatments for cancer and other diseases, the
drug's manufacturer said.
   The drug, called granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating
factor, or GM-CSF, works by promoting the growth of white blood
cells, which are key to the body's immune system.
   The FDA said it will review the advisory panel's recommendation.
   GM-CSF, a genetically engineered version of a human protein, is
produced by Immunex Corp. of Seattle.
   About 10,000 people a year undergo bone marrow transplants as
part of their treatment for lymphoma cancers, said Michael Kranda,
president of Immunex. These transplants also are being used to
treat breast cancer and other diseases.
   These treatments involve removing some of a patient's bone
marrow, which makes the body's disease-fighting white blood cells.
After marrow is removed, the patient is treated with high doses of
chemotherapy or radiation, or both.
   When the treatments are finished, the marrow that initially was
removed is put back in the patient. GM-CSF is given at that time to
accelerate the marrow's production of white blood cells.
   Immunex is also testing the drug as an adjunct to chemotherapy
to allow patients to tolerate higher doses of cancer-killing drugs,
he said.

<HEAD>Gay Group Sues State Officials Over Road Cleanup Refusal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gay rights group has filed a lawsuit over
the refusal of state transportation officials to fully recognize
the group as participating in an ``Adopt-a-Highway'' road cleanup
program.
   The North Carolina Department of Transportation agreed in June
to allow the Southern Appalachian Lesbian and Gay Alliance of
Asheville to join the program, in which groups regularly clean up
litter on roadsides marked with green-and-white signs bearing the
organizations' names.
   But department officials said they would not place a sign
identifying SALGA as the sponsor of a two-mile stretch of
Interstate 40 in Buncombe County.
   The department last year turned down an application from a Ku
Klux Klan faction. It also turned down applications from a
Fayetteville lingerie shop called The Bra Patch and a Chapel Hill
rock band called The Sex Police.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Raleigh
against two highway department officials, said the department's
action ``denied (SALGA's) access to a public forum because of the
purpose and nature of the organization and the content of its
members' beliefs.''
   The department's decision was made ``because (SALGA's)
association and beliefs are offensive to the defendants (and) ...
constitutes a policy of censorship and discrimination,'' said the
lawsuit, which was filed by lawyers paid by the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   Or, the lawsuit said, the decision was made ``because of
perceived hostility on the part of some segments of the public to
the lawful objectives of SALGA and the beliefs of its members,
thereby giving the force of law to private prejudices and
irrational stereotypes.''
   The department has said it would not place a sign bearing
SALGA's name because of safety concerns.
   The lawsuit cites state and federal constitutional guarantees of
freedom of speech and equal protection under the law in asking the
court to direct DOT to allow SALGA to fully participate in the
program. It also asks the court to award the group and its
chairman, Teri Gibbs, an unspecified amount of monetary damages.
   The lawsuit lists Secretary of Transportation Tommy Harrelson
and Betsy Powell, director of DOT's beautification programs, as
defendants.
   ``Now, it's a matter for the courts to decide,'' said William
Powell, DOT special assistant for operations.
   Department spokesman Joanne Latham said in September that DOT
``felt that the identification of a group that is perceivd by some
in not-favorable terms might cause a hazard to groups collecting
along the road, or to others.''
   Ms. Gibbs said the risks to SALGA members would be slight.
   ``By the time people read the sign and figured out who we were,
it would take a real concentrated effort for them to do anything to
us,'' she said.
   ``If the state believes that somebody would commit a crime on
these people because they are performing a service to the
community, it needs to protect them, not prevent them from
performing the sentence,'' said William Simpson Jr., a lawyer for
the state chapter of the ACLU.
   The ACLU believes that by denying SALGA's request ``the state
really is empowering prejudices and stereotypes,'' Simpson said.

<HEAD>Owner Vows To Keep Searching For Pet Lion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRANSON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An animal trainer is worried about his pet
lion, who ran away earlier this month and some say has been shot in
the face.
   ``If she doesn't want to be seen, she won't be seen. They can be
very elusive,'' said Kurt Falkenbach, owner of the missing cat.
   Teasha is a 2-year-old lion Falkenbach has raised since she was
4 days old. She weighs 250 pounds and still has her claws and
fangs.
   Stone County authorities reported that someone shot the animal
in the face with shotgun birdshot, probably on Monday morning as it
was laying alongside a road.
   ``I think it was a very ignorant person with no brains in his
head,'' Falkenbach said. ``For someone to go out and shoot a large
animal like that with birdshot; that's like trying to hunt a
grizzly bear with a switch.''
   Anyone who sees the lion should stay away from it and call
authorities, he said.
   ``I plan on looking until I find her. I have every intention of
giving her a proper burial - if it comes to that,'' Falkenbach
said.
   Teasha has been missing since Dec. 6. The cat apparently escaped
through a small hole at the corner of her 250-square-foot pen,
which is surrounded by an 8-foot chain-link fence.
   Falkenbach, an animal trainer who enjoys exotic pets, has been
conducting his own search, on land and with an airplane piloted by
volunteers at College of the Ozarks airport.
   ``We've always supplied everything for her,'' he said. ``She's
always had food, drinking water, someplace to sleep. She wouldn't
know what to do with a cow or cattle if she came upon one.''

<HEAD>Mass Grave of Stalin's Victims Reported in Turkmenia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The KGB has found a mass grave in the Central
Asian republic of Turkmenia containing the remains of victims
killed in the bloody repressions of dictator Josef Stalin, it was
reported Thursday.
   The grave is near the village of Dilevar in north-central
Turkmenia, close to the border with the republic of Uzbekistan,
according to the government newspaper Izvestia.
   It did not say how many people were believed buried in the
grave.
   Elderly residents tipped off authorities to the find, Izvestia
quoted Turkmenian KGB chief P. Arkhipov as saying.
   An investigation by forensics experts has been ordered, the
newspaper said.
   An estimated 20 million people died in the purges during
Stalin's rule from the late 1920s to the early 1950s. Under
glasnost, the policy of openness initiated by President Mikhail
Gorbachev, the Soviet press began reporting the discovery of mass
graves containing Stalin's victims about two years ago.
   The first grave discovery was reported by the press in fall 1988
with the discovery of a killing field in the Kuropaty forest of
Byelorussia and a similar discovery in Bykovnya in the Ukraine.
   Dozens of mass graves have been reported since a Communist Party
decree in 1989 ordered local governments to do all they could to
redress the Stalin-era wrongs, including cooperating with groups
that coordinate searches for gravesites.

   ``Preview: First Look at the New'' became part
of the past Thursday as the ambitious but low-rated new syndicated
series was canceled. The move will put its 130-member staff out of
work at year's end.
   The half-hour weeknight series premiered in August and offered
celebrity interviews, entertainment news, and previews of new
fashions, films, music and TV shows. It had been two years in
development.
   Al Masini, the show's executive producer, on Thursday notified
the 80 stations carrying ``Preview'' that its last telecast will be
on Dec. 28 and the last one-hour weekend version of the show on
Dec. 30, a spokesman said.
   Masini told his staff of the cancellation Wednesday.
   Like virtually all new syndicated series this season,
``Preview,'' based here and in Los Angeles, had trouble getting
audiences.
   It had seven commentators on various topics, among them singer
Marilyn McCoo and gossip reporter Rona Elliot.
   In his letter to the stations, Masini said part of the show's
problem was that it couldn't get ``significant clearances'' in the
evening hours before prime time in such major markets as New York,
Los Angeles and Phildelphia.
   Nor did it make headway in the important November ratings
``sweeps,'' one of four key periods each year for stations, he
added. The stations use the results to set the rates they charge
advertisers.
   ``The arrival of the November (ratings) books in the last two
days did not trigger the success stories we had hoped to see, which
would have triggered the momentum to improve our depth of
clearance,'' he said.
   Masini, a co-creator of the veteran ``Entertainment Tonight''
series, is president of New York-based Television Program
Enterprises, which makes and syndicates two other successful
series,``Star Search'' and ``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.''
   His ``Preview,'' which occasionally used ``Rich and Famous''
host Robin Leach as a commentator, ranked 82nd out of 160
syndicated shows in ratings for far this season, according to
Nielsen audience estimates.
   It averaged a miniscule 2 rating, meaning it was seen in just
over 1.8 million homes each week, Nielsen estimates showed.

<HEAD>Medellin Cocaine Cartel Frees Hostage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Medellin cocaine cartel on Thursday
released a television news producer it had been holding more than
three months in what appeared to be another step toward a peace
deal with the government.
   A taxi drove up to the offices of Medellin's El Colombiano
newspaper and dropped off Azucena Lievano, who had been held
hostage by the drug traffickers for 104 days.
   She was one of nine journalists kidnapped by the cartel the past
several months, and the third to be released in less than three
weeks, including a German journalist on Monday.
   The latest release appeared to be another step toward reaching a
deal with authorities.
   In late November, cartel bosses said as many as 300 drug
traffickers would be willing to surrender in exchange for
government legal guarantees. These include not being being treated
as criminals and an end to extraditions to the United States, where
they would face trial on drug-trafficking charges.
   The government has warmed up to the offer. Officials have said
that surrendering traffickers would not be extradited and would
receive reduced prison sentences if they confess at least one
crime.
   Three mid-level drug traffickers have already accepted the
government's offer and turned themselves in.
   However, the cartel's top bosses - Pablo Escobar and Jorge Luis
Ochoa - remain at large.
   Juan Gomez, publisher of El Colombiano and former Medellin
mayor, said the cartel was releasing the journalists as a step
toward peace.
   ``The kidnappings have to be resolved before attending the other
issues,'' Gomez said in an interview over the Caracol radio
network.
   The cartel said it abducted the journalists in retaliation for
human rights abuses by police. It is also apparently wants to
pressure the government to grant pardons.
   Interior Minister Julio Sanchez said the government on Friday
will announce modifications of legislation allowing drug
traffickers to surrender.
   Lievano is news producer of television's Cripton news.
   Journalists still abducted include Francisco Santos, editor of
Colombia's biggest-selling newspaper, El Tiempo, and Diana Turbay,
a magazine publisher and daughter of former President Julio Cesar
Turbay.
   The Medellin cartel has been blamed for killing 550 Colombians
since the government and drug traffickers declared war on each
other in August 1989.

<HEAD>Army Doctor with Orders to Saudi Arabia Goes on Hunger Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flight surgeon with orders for Saudi
Arabia is on a hunger strike and hopes he will be discharged from
the Army after becoming too debilitated to work.
   Capt. David Wiggins, 28, a West Point graduate, said he opposes
war and has been trying to get out of the Army since February. He
is scheduled to ship out to Saudi Arabia on Monday.
   ``I came away from West Point realizing that moral decisions are
up to you,'' Wiggins said. ``War is not a necessary evil, because
non-violent political change is possible.''
   He said his hunger strike is designed to make him of no use to
the Army, and he believes he soon will be unable to perform his
duties.
   On a diet of water and vitamins, the 5-foot-10-inch Wiggins said
his weight has dropped from 167 pounds to 152. He began the fast
Nov. 30 after a federal judge refused to overturn the Army's ruling
that he could not be discharged as a consciencious objector.
   ``I am applying for conscientious objector status because I have
come to the conclusion that it is immoral and futile to defend
freedom through the use of military force,'' Wiggins wrote in his
application in February.
   ``Freedom is a natural human drive, spontaneously expressed,
which does not need defense and rebels against force of any kind.
Only through non-violent means can we safely defend our freedom.''
   Wiggins has offered to pay the government for his education at
New York Medical College.
   Initially, an Army investigator and other officials concluded
Wiggins merited the consciencious objector status. His commanding
officers blocked the move, and his request was rejected by the
Conscientious Objector Review Board. In late November, a U.S.
district judge denied Wiggins' first legal attempt to overturn the
board.
   Wiggins said that as an 18-year-old, he thought ``war was good
if America was fighting it.''
   He described his hometown of Waverly, N.Y., as an isolated,
conservative town steeped in a white, Anglo-Saxon world of God and
country.
   Wiggins applied to the U.S. Military Academy and only one other
college.
   ``I was very proud to go to West Point,'' he said. But he said
life there opened his eyes to a military world different from his
dreams of glory.
   At medical school, Wiggins said met minorities and people from
other religions that led him to rethink his world views.
   ``They were good people,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   If you were casting a movie about the Keating
Five, would you pick Vincent Price to portray Sen. Alan Cranston?
How about Robert Duvall as Sen. Dennis DeConcini?
   And who would play Charles H. Keating Jr., the former savings
and loan executive who raised $1.3 million for five senators and
persuaded them to help in his fight with thrift regulators?
   Would you believe Jimmy Stewart?
   The staff of Roll Call, a privately owned newspaper that
circulates on Capitol Hill, ran a fake full-page ad Thursday to
announce a new movie: ``The Keating Five.''
   It's a spoof on the Senate Ethics Committee hearings now under
way on the ties of Cranston, D-Calif., DeConcini, D-Ariz. and three
Senate colleagues to Keating - who owned the failed Lincoln Savings
and Loan.
   ``First there was `The Magnificent Seven' ... then `The Dirty
Dozen,''' the ad says. ``Now ... the U.S. Senate, in conjunction
with the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, presents a
Constituent Services Inc. production of `The Keating Five.'''
   While many followers of the case were chuckling over the ad, the
committee remained at work behind closed doors to hear James
Grogan, a top aide to Keating.
   After two days of testifying in private, Grogan was told to
appear Friday in a public session. He's testifying under a grant of
limited immunity.
   Roll Call writer Craig Winneker, who coordinated the project,
said the newspaper staff cast the actors first, ``and then pulled
out their pictures. We were amazed how much they matched.''
   In addition to Cranston and DeConcini, other stars of the
``movie'' are Ed Harris as Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio; Tom Cruise as
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.; and William Shatner as Sen. Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   Apparently only four members of the six-senator Ethics Committee
will be portrayed.
   Ned Beatty is cast as Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala.; Jason
Robards as Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Rod Steiger as Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.; and Ron Howard as Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss.
   No actors were chosen for Sens. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., or David
Pryor, D-Ark.
   Cher is cast as McCain aide Gwendolyn Van Paasschen and Melanie
Griffith is Cranston fund-raiser Joy Jacobson, both witnesses in
the hearings.
   John Candy is Ethics Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett
and Don Ho has the part of Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, who was a
character witness for DeConcini.
   Martin Balsam is Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board and Dennis Hopper is cast as Gray's successor,
M. Danny Wall.
   Mother Teresa, mentioned several times in the hearings as a
recipient of Keating's largesse, would make a special appearance as
herself.
   There is one precaution for viewing the film.
   ``No one will be admitted during the final 15 minutes while the
Ethics Committee deliberates,'' the ad says.

   Freed hostage Jack Rinehart got a hero's
welcome Thursday and said his town's rejoicing was both a personal
triumph and ``a way to show the world we love freedom.''
   Rinehart was among the first batch of Americans who were allowed
to leave Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. The ceremony was attended by many
of this town's 1,000 residents, who decorated downtown light poles
with U.S. flags and yellow ribbons. Shops displayed signs
proclaiming, ``Welcome Home, Jack.''
   ``I hope it stands for freedom around the world,'' he said. ``We
need that. We need to get on with our lives. We don't need these
small-time political thugs like Saddam Hussein to continue coming
into the picture and ruining our lives.''
   Rinehart, 37, was on his third overseas business trip when Iraq
invaded Kuwait in August. He spent 4{ months in the U.S. Embassy at
Kuwait City, serving as a plumber and electrician.
   Rinehart called Nat Howell, the Kuwaiti ambassador, a hero and a
``tremendous leader.''
   ``He drank the same dirty water, he slept outside with the flies
and the heat,'' said Rinehart. ``He's a hero, like John Wayne.''
   Howell left Baghdad on Thursday on what was said to be the last
charter plane carrying foreigners from Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   While in the embassy, Rinehart lost 25 pounds on a diet of rice
and tuna.
   Rinehart said he feasted on fried chicken when he returned to
Missouri. He is taking the rest of the year off from his job as an
air-conditioning designer at Fasco Industries Inc.'s plant at
Eldon, 30 miles away. But Rinehart said he looked forward to
returning to work.
   He grinned as a cheerleading squad, which included his
16-year-old daughter, Candy, chanted, ``Stand up, and get on down,
'cause Jack is back in town.''
   Rinehart became solemn as cheerleader Valerie McDaniel, his
daughter's best friend, read a poem:
   ``Though I waited and worried, I tried to be strong. Not a day
would go by, not a minute would pass. But now time will fly - he's
home at last.
   ``I thank God that he's back, and he's here by my side. When I
think of my Jack, my heart swells with pride. His courage and his
faith brought him through each day. The Lord kept him safe, and now
home he will stay.''

<HEAD>AIDS-Infected Cells May Poison Brain, Causing Mental Confusion,
Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New laboratory studies suggest that some types
of cells infected with the AIDS virus may release a poison that
disrupts thinking processes and causes the mental decline seen in
70 percent of AIDS patients.
   ``We've found that one class of cells when infected (with the
AIDS virus) will release a toxin that can disrupt the nervous
system,'' said Dr. Dana Giulian, a researcher at the Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston.
   A research paper on the discovery is to be published Friday in
the journal Science.
   In an interview, Giulian said test tube experiments showed that
monocytes, an immune system cell in the blood, will secrete poison
molecules when infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or
HIV, which causes AIDS.
   When these molecules were exposed to neurons, it would cause the
nerve cells to either die or stop functioning, said Giulian.
   This suggests, said the researcher, that similar cells in the
brain, called macrophages, could react the same way when infected
by HIV. This finding, said Giulian, must be confirmed by further
research.
   Just why AIDS patients develop mental decline has long been a
puzzle to physicians and scientists.
   Studies disclosed early in the AIDS epidemic that macrophage
cells found in the brain can be infected by the HIV virus. But
neurons, which are the vital cells to mental function, were never
infected with the virus. And, yet, somehow, the neurons were
damaged.
   ``If you look in the brains there is infection, but it's not in
the neurons. It has no direct action on the neurons,'' said
Giulian. ``So the question is, how does the brain become
disrupted?''
   The toxin secreted by the infected cells could be the answer.
   Giulian said the next job is to identify the secreted molecule
that is toxic to the brain. This, he said, may be a difficult job.
   ``Macrophages are like little biochemical factories,'' he said.
``They produce hundreds of different molecules which have toxicity
on various cells.''
   In a healthy immune system, the macrophage is a vital worker
against disease. It circulates in the blood and will engulf and
destroy invading bacteria or viruses. It also secretes toxins that
can kill certain cells and it will collect debris, such as dead
cells.
   Giulian's co-authors of the Science report were Ken Vaca and
Christine A. Noonan, also of Baylor.
   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

   A leader of the rebels said
Thursday their victory over 200 elite government troops who fled to
Honduras shows low army morale, but officials said the soldiers
merely made a strategic retreat.
   The defeat of the army troops Wednesday also set off a round of
finger-pointing among members of the army's ground and air forces,
who each blamed the other for the defeat.
   More than two companies of the Bracamonte Battalion, whose
officers are American-trained, retreated into neighboring Honduras
after 40 hours of heavy combat with guerrilla troops.
   Honduran Foreign Minister Mario Carias reported Wednesday that
more than 200 Bracamonte troops, including about 30 wounded, took
refuge in Honduras.
   Both rebel and government officers said the defeat was due in
part to lack of air support.
   Government pilots have become extremely cautious in supporting
ground troops since Nov. 23, when the guerrillas shot down a
warplane with a surface-to-air missile for the first time in the
11-year-old war.
   ``This tremendous licking (of the Bracamonte troops) is a
political disgrace for the government of Alfredo Cristiani and a
military shame for Col. Rene Emilio Ponce,'' El Salvador's defense
minister, the clandestine rebel radio station said on Thursday.
   ``Elite troops trained in the United States had to take refuge
in Honduras in light of their inability to fight our forces,'' the
rebel radio said.
   Combat had raged since Tuesday in the northern rrovince of
Chalatenango, which borders Honduras. The fighting is a part of a
leftist rebel offensive against the right-wing government that
began Nov. 20.
   Guerrilla commander German Serrano said the rebel victory
``illustrates the tremendously low morale of the army and the air
force.''
   Interviewed on rebel radio in Chalatenango, Serrano said: ``The
air force could not rescue them, so they were abandoned. It's no
longer a matter of combat morale. It transcends morale and takes on
an aspect of political crisis surrounding the army.''
   Serrano claimed the insurgents inflicted 150 casualties,
including dead and wounded. He said they took 14 prisoners,
including three seriously wounded who were handed over to the Red
Cross.
   At a news conference in Tegucigalpa, El Salvador's ambassador to
Honduras, Salvador Trigueros, described the Bracamonte soldiers'
move into Honduras as a ``tactical retreat.''
   ``Because it was impossible to evacuate personnel wounded in
combat, members of El Salvador's armed forces opted to take them to
Honduran territory for medical attention,'' the Salvadoran
government said in a communique Thursday.
   It said armed forces helicopters failed in an attempt to
evacuate troops after rebel fire injured a pilot and co-pilot of
one aircraft and punched holes in another.
   Repatriation of the stranded soldiers began Thursday with a
flight from Tegucigalpa to the air force headquarters at Ilopango,
just east of the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador. The government
said all its troops had returned to home territory by Thursday
afternoon.
   An Air Force helicopter pilot conceded government airmen had
been seriously shaken by the insurgents' downing of two warplanes
and a helicopter since Nov. 23. But he also blamed the ground
troops for becoming too dependent on air support.
   ``What you feel when taking off on a mission now is completely
different from what you felt three weeks ago,'' said the pilot, who
has thousands of hours of combat flying experience and spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Now it's Russian roulette. It's like we're about to have a
fistfight, and you pull out a pistol,'' he said.
   The pilot added that the infantry had ``become spoiled with
regard to air support. When they don't get it, for whatever reason,
they lose much of their effectiveness.''
   An infantry lieutenant just returned to the capital after 40
days of operations in Chalatenango contested the airman's
allegations.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his
troops went hungry at times and were low on ammunition because
helicopter pilots feared landing in zones where rebel anti-aircraft
fire is likely.
   The rebels' latest offensive is designed to oblige the armed
forces to make concessions during U.N.-mediated peace talks
tentatively set for late December, according to their leaders.
   After the rebel victory Wednesday, the United States criticized
anew the insurgent force, saying it has shown unwillingness to
negotiate. ``It has refused to discuss anything except the complete
abolition of the Salvadoran army,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler in Washington.
   The offensive has killed 342 people since Nov. 20, according to
the army. Another 900 people are estimated to have been wounded,
the army said. The rebels claim to have killed or wounded more than
700 soldiers.

   A federal judge sentenced a retired CIA agent
Thursday to 16 months in prison and fined him $40,000 for failing
to report profits from arms sales made during the Iran-Contra
affair.
   U.S. District Judge Norman P. Ramsey ordered Thomas G. Clines to
pay $200 in court costs and the cost of prosecution, which has not
been determined.
   Clines' prison sentence is the stiffest of any of the
Iran-Contra defendants, including former National Security Adviser
John M. Poindexter and retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North.
   ``I think it was very severe,'' Clines said, adding he plans to
appeal.
   Lawrence Walsh, Iran-Contra independent counsel whose office
spent three years tracing the money trail, issued a one-sentence
statement in Washington thanking Ramsey.
   ``We very much appreciate Judge Ramsey's fair and efficient
handling of the entire prosecution,'' Walsh said.
   Clines, 62, of Middleburg, Va., was free pending appeal, which
must be filed within 10 days. He was convicted Sept. 18 of two
charges of failing to report profits of at least $203,431 in 1985
an $57,009 in 1986.
   He was also convicted of failing to inform the Internal Revenue
Service about overseas financial accounts and of not filing tax
forms required for them.
   Clines had faced up to 16 years in prison and a $1 million fine
for under-reporting the money he made selling weapons to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   During a 10-day trial, prosecutors characterized Clines as a
sophisticated businessman who established dummy foreign
corporations to hide his financial dealings from the IRS.
   Defense attorneys argued that Clines misunderstood how to report
his earnings and was unfamiliar with IRS regulations that required
him to report foreign financial accounts. Clines' attorney Paula M.
Junghans contended that Clines was a victim of selective government
prosecution, accusing Walsh of going after her client for political
reasons.
   She said she was ``disappointed'' by the sentence, but did not
elaborate.
   Clines' sentencing was postponed from Nov. 30 because of
jockeying between the prosecution and defense over a probation
officer's report that the chief prosecutor Stuart E. Abrams argued
did not accurately reflect Clines' worth.
   Junghans said attorney fees and other expenses had depleted
Clines' finances.
   Ramsey said the income statement was irrelevant to the fine he
imposed. The judge said he based the fine on the amount of income
Clines failed to report to the IRS.
   Walsh's office spent $22.1 million through Aug. 31. Abrams said
the cost of the Clines prosecution was not immediately available.
   Clines tested, bought and arranged shipments of rifles, machine
guns grenades and explosives to the Contra rebels at a time when
they were outlawed by Congress.
   Witnesses testified that Clines was in the arms business with
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and his business
partner, Albert Hakim. The three shared some profits with Canadian
arms dealer Emanuel Weigensberg.
   The operation was directed by Poindexter and North.
   Clines was prosecuted in Baltimore because his tax preparer is
from Bethesda, Md.
   So far, eight people and one corporation have either been found
guilty or pleaded guilty to crimes arising out of the Iran-Contra
affair.
   On each of two counts of under-reporting his income, Clines
received separate eight-month sentences to run consecutively.
   On two counts of failing to report foreign accounts to the IRS,
Clines received two consecutive six-month sentences, to be served
at the same time as the 16-month term.
   For each of the four counts, he was fined $10,000.
   North received a three-year suspended prison sentence, two years
probation, $150,000 in fines and 1,200 hours of community service.
   Poindexter, who was convicted of five felonies, was sentenced to
six month prison sentences on each count to be served currently and
$250 in court costs. He has appealed his conviction.

<HEAD>Thompson to Join One of Nation's Top Law Firms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. James R. Thompson, nearing the end of an
unprecedented fourth term as Illinois governor, said Thursday he
plans to rejoin the same law firm he left when he took office 14
years ago.
   Thompson, who was courted by some of the city's best-known law
firms, will become a partner in the Chicago-based Winston &amp; Strawn
after he leaves office Jan. 14.
   He was associated with the firm for a year before he took office
in 1976.
   The governor said he turned down corporate offers and chose
Winston &amp; Strawn because he believes the law firm has the potential
to expand into an international practice.
   ``I have always told people during my time as governor that I
was a lawyer at heart,'' he said at a news conference. ``So, I am
ready, able, anxious and excited to be a lawyer again.''
   Thompson, a Republican, again promised to remain active in
politics. He said he hasn't ruled out another run for office.
   Gary Fairchild, the law firm's managing partner, said he was
``overjoyed'' by the governor's decision. He said Thompson will
play a big role in attracting more clients to the growing firm.
   ``With the governor's presence in our ranks, we expect we'll
continue expanding,'' Fairchild said.
   Winston &amp; Strawn, founded in 1853, has merged with two prominent
law firms in the past three years to make it one of the nation's 20
largest with more than 475 attorneys, said Randall Samborn, the
Chicago bureau chief for the National Law Journal.
   Thompson would not say how much the law firm would pay him for
his services.
   ``That is a private matter,'' he said. ``And you don't know how
long I've waited to say those words.''

<TEXT>
   Koala Springs beverages went back on the
shelves Thursday following a voluntary one-month recall after
traces of benzene were found in the product, company officials
said.
   Routine testing by the Florida Department of Health last month
found minute traces of benzene in the beverage. The levels were
much lower than those considered normal in many common food
products such as fruits and coffee, the company said.
   Koala Springs markets sparkling water with fruit juice products
in eight flavors such as Orange &amp; Mango and Raspberry, Guava &amp;
Apple.
   ``The extensive testing conducted by the company confirmed that
the product i safe and could be reintroduced into the
marketplace,'' said Greg Tunks, operations director for Koala
Springs International. ``Providing a quality product is at the core
of our business.''
   The company said it voluntarily withdrew its beverages from the
market while tests were being conducted to confirm its safety and
to ensure there was no external source of contamination. The tests
were conducted because the products were classified as a bottled
water.
   Koala Springs products originated in Australia and were
introduced in the United States in 1986.
   The company is not planning any special packaging for its
reintroduced products, but ``we will be putting together a
promotional package that will highlight that we're back and give an
explanation,'' Tunks said.

<HEAD>Conference Tells Political Activists How to Throw the Rascals Out</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Veterans of successful efforts to limit
the number of years lawmakers stay in office offered advice
Thursday on how to throw the rascals out. Lesson No. 1: Don't call
'em rascals.
   ``Most of them aren't rascals,'' said Colorado state Sen. Terry
Considine, who backed his state's term-limiting law. ``They come to
it (lawmaking) with a good heart.''
   Considine spoke at a daylong conference attended by more than
100 people from at least 20 states who say they are part of a
growing national movement to get rid of the ``career lawmaker.''
   ``People are organizing in all 50 states,'' said Paul Beckner,
executive director of Citizens for Congressional Reform in
Washington, D.C., another conference panelist. ``It's clear we have
a broad-based movement.''
   Considine's panel comprised political activists who led
victorious campaigns to limit the terms and re-election bids of
legislators in California, Colorado and Oklahoma.
   Negative campaigns are tempting but unwise, they said. Recent
history offers the best illustration. Despite widespread anger at
politicians for such blunders as the savings and loan crisis,
voters across the country in 1990 reelected 97 percent of
incumbents running for state and congressional offices.
   Instead, the activists said, campaigns to limit service in the
state houses and Congress should emphasize a return to a citizen
legislature: the people's government intended by the nation's
founders.
   ``What we need is citizen legislators who call it like they see
it then return home to their real jobs,'' sais Considine.
   The movement, if it is one, has a sense of humor. In Oregon the
effort to limit lawmakers' tenure goes by the slogan: Let
Incumbents Mosey Into The Sunset, or LIMITS.
   Ed Crane, president of the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C.,
which does policy analysis, said the public no longer wants career
legislators but people who view service as their civic duty.
   ``What we want are people in a citizen legislature who view
themselves as on a leave of absence from their real jobs,'' Crane
said. ``This movement is an opportunity for Americans to regain
control of their government.''
   Crane warned that the grass roots movement, though widely
supported, could be hurt if politicians support it. That includes
President Bush, who will call for limits on congressional terms
during his State of the Union address next month. That was
disclosed earlier this week by Chief of Staff John Sununu, though
he didn't give specifics.
   ``It would be much better if the movement were citizen-led,'' he
said. ``Bush and (Vice President Dan) Quayle did real damage when
they came to this state to support Proposition 140.''
   Colorado voters this year approved limits of eight years in
office for members of both chambers of their state legislature.
They also approved a limit of 12 years in office for their U.S.
senators and representatives. The first such initiative to deal
with jobs in Congress, conference organizers said.
   The California referendum, which passed in November with 52
percent of the vote, set limits of three two-year terms for
Assembly members and two four-year terms for state senators. The
law also limited state executives, including the governor, to two
four-year terms.
   In Oklahoma this year voters approved a limit of 12 years in
office for their state lawmakers.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Thousands of Haitians prayed for
peace and some cheered their favorite presidential candidate
Thursday at a funeral Mass for seven people killed in an attack at
a campaign rally.
   More than 2,000 supporters of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide
turned the funeral into a demonstration when they shouted
``Aristide for president!''
   They were assembled inside and outside the Sacred Heart Church,
where the funeral was held. Inside, religious leaders at the Mass
prayed that ``blood will no longer flow'' during the national
election campaign.
   The vote is set for Sunday.
   The seven people died Dec. 5, when unknown attackers threw a
grenade and opened fire at the rally for the Roman Catholic priest.
   Aristide, 37, ousted from the Salesian Order in 1988 for
allegedly fomenting revolution, is believed the front-runner in a
field of 11 candidates for president. An interim, civilian
government is struggling to usher this impoverished Caribbean
nation through its first democratic elections.
   With tears streaming down his face, Aristide spoke from the
altar Thursday, telling the congregation packed inside, ``We have
to take heart and organize for life.'' He then led the
congregation, many holding lighted candles, in singing the national
anthem.
   Outside, hundreds of Aristide supporters wearing headbands with
his name emblazoned in red letters cried ``No more!'' as the
coffins of six of the victims were lowered from hearses. The
seventh victim was buried in the interior of the country.
   A huge black banner reading ``We demand justice for the victims
of Dec. 5!'' followed a procession in the church,and a band played
a funeral march.
   Diplomats, including U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams, as well as
political leaders and other presidential candidates, attended the
two-hour service.
   ``Let us pray to God that our in country tears and blood will no
longer flow,'' the Rev. William Smarth said at the service.
   There were no violent incidents, but police had to prevent angry
mobs from attacking two men arrested outside the church. One man
was arrested for allegedly carrying a gun and a transmitter radio,
and another suspect was taken in for reportedly handing out phony
ballots.
   ``We consider ourselves long-suffering people. We have never had
a leader. Aristide is the first and only leader in Haiti,'' said
Divolea Nozel, standing outside the church. ``He doesn't have blood
in his hands, like all the other leaders we've had since 1804.''
   This Caribbean nation of 6 million people gained independence
from France in 1804 and has been led mostly by tyrants since.
   Many fear the private Tonton Macoutes militia, a group of thugs
who enforced the Duvalier dictatorship, and some elements of the
country's widely feared army will disrupt the balloting. Aristide
has blamed the Dec. 5 killings on Tonton Macoutes.
   The Duvalier family dictatorship, which began in 1957 with
Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, ended when his son, Jean-Claude
``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, fled to exile in France in 1986 during an
uprising.
   In November 1987 elections, thugs supported by the army
massacred 34 voters at the polls, forcing cancellation of the
balloting. A subsequent election in January 1988 was rigged by the
army.
   Later Thursday, about 7,500 people went to the cemetery where
six of the victims were buried.
   ``They can't kill us all!'' said one youth at the cemetery.

   Former drug policy director William Bennett on
Thursday spurned President Bush's offer to be chairman of the
Republican National Committee after White House lawyers told him
he'd have to give up a book contract and other outside income.
   ``I didn't take a vow of poverty,'' Bennett told reporters after
giving Chief of Staff John Sununu his letter declining the offer
just two weeks after he'd accepted it.
   Bennett indicated he was initially told by the White House that
his plans to write two books and accept payments for speeches would
not present a problem.
   However, Bennett said, ``the advice changed.'' He said he was
told by White House counsel Boyden Gray that accepting the outside
income while serving as RNC chairman would violate the Ethics in
Government Act.
   One source familiar with the back-and-forth said Gray had
cautioned Bennett early on about the risks of appearance of
impropriety, but backed off under pressure from Sununu, who wanted
Bennett to be able to take the job. The source spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Thursday's surprise development was an embarrassment to both
Bush and Bennett and sent the White House scurrying in search for a
new candidate to take over day-to-day operation of the party from
the ailing Lee Atwater.
   However, some party regulars - who had never been comfortable
with the notion of the combative, arch conservative Bennett as
party chairman - expressed relief.
   ``I thought Bennett was a mistake in the first place,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``He'd only been a
Republican for about four years, never run for office and, to me,
it's got to be somebody who understands and likes politics.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was
disappointed, and that a replacement had not been chosen. The RNC
was expected to rubber stamp Bush's choice.
   Administration and Republican sources said that Secretary of
Transportation Samuel Skinner; HUD Secretary Jack Kemp; Secretary
of Commerce Robert Mosbacher; defeated Sen. Rudy Boschwitz,
R-Minn.; Mississippi GOP leader Haley Barbour, and longtime party
operative Rich Bond were among those being considered. Also, one
party source said Bush had spoken to former Rep. Thomas Loeffler of
Texas about the job but had not offered it to him. Loeffler is a
close friend of the president.
   Republican sources said Bond was lobbying for the job, but
Barbour said he wasn't interested.
   ``I just don't have an interest in it,'' Barbour said in a
telephone interview. ``I am not soliciting the job and would not
want it if asked. But I don't think I'm under consideration.''
   Bennett, 47, outspoken and controversial, resigned Nov. 8 as
Bush's drug enforcement control director. He was secretary of
education during the Reagan administration and now is a fellow at
the Hudson Institute, a conservative political research
organization.
   In a letter to Bush written on Hudson Institute stationery,
Bennett told Bush:
   ``I share your commitment to the highest ethical standards in
public service and I would not want to do anything to jeopardize
our shared commitment to those standards.''
   He cited a ``longstanding contractual commitment to Simon and
Schuster to write two books,'' including one on his experiences in
government.
   Bennett received a $187,500 advance from Simon &amp; Schuster for
the two books, according to financial disclosure forms.
   ``He spent it. He's either got to write the book or pay it
back,'' Fitzwater said. ``He's not a millionaire.''
   Even so, Bennett reported receiving $240,000 in speaking fees
alone in the four months between his resignation as education
secretary in September 1988 and when he was given the job as drug
policy director.
   He would have made $125,100 a year as RNC chairman.
   Fitzwater said Bush, Bennett and Gray met Wednesday at the White
House to see if there was any way around the dilemma and decided
there wasn't.
   Other party chairmen - including Atwater and Democratic Chairman
Ron Brown - have been able to supplement their income with private
earnings.
   But Bennett, because of his recent administration job, is
covered by a provision of the Ethics in Government Act that deals
with former government officials.
   That measure bars former officials from lobbying - or even
having extended contact with - the executive branch for one year
after their departure.
   ``It would have been tough for him to have accepted money for
speeches, for example, from corporations or consulting groups, and
then go to business with a Cabinet agency or somehow else that he
would have to consult with for RNC business,'' Fitzwater said.
   Administration and GOP sources said that Bennett was furious at
the changing signals from the White House, and from Gray in
particular.
   ``Two weeks ago I got a green light, two days ago I got a yellow
to red,'' Bennett said.
   However, Bennett told reporters that he had gotten similar
advice from two other lawyers, including his brother.
   Gray told The Associated Press he warned Bennett all along that
there ``were restrictions on whom he could speak to.''
   ``At the time, it was hypothetical whom he would speak to,''
Gray said.
   But he said Bennett subsequently lined up speaking engagements
with various industry and trade groups that had direct interests in
lobbying the administration on policy matters.
   Gray also said the Justice Department had been working on an
opinion, sure to have been controversial, saying that the one-year
ban on contact with an official's former agency was not meant to
apply to party chairmen.
   DNC Chairman Brown said Bennett's tenure ``lasted about as long
as most of President Bush's campaign promises.'' Democrats also
offered some tongue-in-cheek help to the RNC, attaching a mock
``help wanted ad'' to Brown's statement.
   Some Republicans were critical of Gray.
   ``The chairman of the Republican National Committee is not a
government position. It's an elective position by that body,'' said
GOP consultant Eddie Mahe. ``If anybody has any right to impose any
limits, it's the RNC, not Boyden Gray.''

   Former automaker John Z. DeLorean was
fined $451,000 by state environmental officials who allege water
pollution violations at his estate.
   DeLorean, 65, said he was innocent of the civil charges.
   His attorney, Herbert Bennett, said DeLorean is contesting the
violations and has asked for a hearing before an administrative law
judge.
   On 30 occasions between May 1987 and March 1990, the sewage
treatment plant on DeLorean's 440-acre estate discharged too much
oil and grease, chlorine, suspended solids and organic material
into Middle Brook, John Hagerty, a spokesman for the state
Department of Environmental Protection, said Thursday.
   The discharge poses no hazard to human or aquatic life, but
destroys the brook, he said.
   DeLorean received notice of the violations in October.
   Hagerty called $451,000 an average f's water qualityine for the type
of
treatment plant, which treats 840 gallons of sewage a day.
   DeLorean was acquitted in August 1984 of drug smuggling charges.
He was acquitted in September 1985 of federal fraud and
racketeering charges related to money he was accused of stealing
from his now-defunct car company.

   A judge Thursday dismissed a
first-degree murder charge against the inventor of a suicide
device, saying he broke no law in helping an Alzheimer's disease
patient kill herself.
   The judge announced his decision after hearing a tape of the
Oregon woman discuss her fight against the disease. ``I've had
enough,'' she said on the tape.
   Janet Adkins suffered from Alzheimer's disease but might still
be alive had she not turned on Dr. Jack Kevorkian's device June 4,
District Judge Gerald McNally said at the end of Kevorkian's
two-day preliminary examination.
   But because Michigan law doesn't outlaw suicide or assisting in
it, prosecutors had no case against Kevorkian, McNally said in
dismissing the charge against Kevorkian, a 62-year-old retired
pathologist from Royal Oak.
   There was scattered applause in the courtroom as Kevorkian
turned without expression to shake the hand of his lawyer, Geoffrey
Fieger.
   ``I feel like I'm walking on a cloud,'' Kevorkian said on his
way out of the courthouse.
   Michael Modelski, chief assistant Oakland County prosecutor,
said his office was considering whether to appeal McNally's ruling
to Circuit Court. That court could reinstate the first-degree
murder charge or a lesser charge, such as second-degree murder or
manslaughter, he said.
   ``It was just nice to get a ruling,'' Modelski said. ``I think
everyone realizes this isn't the final step.''
   Adkins' husband, Ronald, said he was relieved the judge
dismissed the case.
   ``I and the family are very pleased and very grateful for the
judge making the decision that he did,'' Adkins said from his
Portland home. ``It's very definitely a relief in the sense that
the family would have to go through this all again. It's really
been very hard for us over the last six months.''
   Despite the dismissal, Kevorkian isn't free to use his device
again.
   Three days after Adkins died, prosecutors obtained a temporary
court order preventing further use of the device. The contraption
remains in police custody pending a civil trial, probably in
January, on whether that order should be made permanent, Fieger
said.
   Prosecutor Richard Thompson filed the murder charge nearly six
months after Adkins died in the back of Kevorkian's van in a
county-owned campground. Kevorkian notified authorities after
Adkins was dead. He was questioned by state police but wasn't
arrested until Dec. 3.
   Autopsy results released in late November showed Adkins, 54, of
Portland, committed suicide with an overdose of medication. Fieger
said in closing arguments that Kevorkian attached an intravenous
tube to Adkins' right arm, but the tube carried only a harmless
saline solution.
   The drugs that caused Adkins to lose consciousness and then
stopped her heart didn't enter her body until after she threw the
switch on Kevorkian's device, Fieger said.
   Closing arguments were heard after the prosecution played a
40-minute videotape police seized after searching Kevorkian's
apartment.
   On the tape made June 2 in a motel room, Kevorkian, Janet and
Ronald Adkins discuss her struggle with Alzheimer's, which causes
irreversible brain degeneration, and her decision to ask
Kevorkian's help in ending her life.
   Adkins gave short and generally clear answers to questions posed
by Kevorkian and her husband.
   ``My life before was wonderful,'' Adkins says. ``I could play
the piano and read. I can't do any of those things (now) ... it's
too taxing.''
   ``Why do you want your life to end?'' Kevorkian asks.
   ``I've had enough,'' Adkins answers, her voice breaking.
   On the tape, Adkins nd her husband, who was not present at
Kevorkian's court examination this week, tell Kevorkian they
learned of his device from reading a Newsweek magazine article and
decided to seek him out. Asked by Kevorkian whether he solicited
their business, Adkins says: ``No, no, no, no.''
   ``I want to get out,'' Adkins said.
   Kevorkian has said he received no fee from the Adkins.
   In announcing his decision, the judge called on the Legislature
to address the issues raised by Kevorkian. A bill introduced by
state Sen. Fred Dillingham would make assisting in a suicide a
felony punishable by four years in prison and a $2,000 fine.

   An ambulance operator billed two
brothers after the duo saved three children from a fire - but the
company said Thursday the demand for $61 was all a big mistake.
   ``It was simply an administrative error. They were not supposed
to be charged in the first place,'' said Pamela Rosen, a
spokeswoman for SCV Paramedical Service. ``As soon as it was called
to our attention we said of course they are not supposed to be
billed.''
   But Jerry Robles, 38, said he thinks the company is trying to
``pull the wool over'' his eyes. He said he believes the operator
simply decided not to bill him and his brother, Gary, after the
matter received attention from the media.
   The brothers spotted smoke coming from the second story window
of a San Jose condominium on Nov. 4. Gary Robles, a Morgan Hill
resident, struggled through the thick smoke to help lead the
children, ages 14 months, 2 and 4 years, to safety.
   The original bill from the ambulance was $109, with $61 for
emergency response, $42 for oxygen and $6 for the nozzle of the
oxygen mask.
   The bill was reduced after the company realized that San Jose
firefighters administered oxygen to one brother from their own
truck.
   ``It's totally unfair,'' said Battalion Chief Dan Bourbon before
the bill was withdrawn. ``If it wasn't for them, we'd have three
dead kids. They (SCV) should forget the bill.''
   Bourbon said he remembered the brothers refusing an ambulance
ride to a hospital. Jerry Robles said he and his brother turned it
down because of the cost.
   Jerry Robles said he tried to explain to the company why they
shouldn't be billed.
   ``I phoned them, but they bounced me from supervisor to
supervisor,'' he said. ``They said the firemen borrowed the oxygen
equipment from them and we had to pay for it.''
   ``I didn't know you could get in trouble for helping people,''
Jerry Robles said. ``We were shocked to get the bill. So were our
friends. We're kind of leery now about helping people if you can
get charged for doing good.''

   Chico Mendes is on sale everywhere in this
remote Amazon river town.
   Oil paintings of Mendes, the slain Amazon ecologist whose
accused killers are on trial here, are on sale for $600.
   Short on cash? No problem. Artist Jorge Rivasplata, who came all
the way from Lima, Peru, says he'll sell the painting without the
wood frame for $500.
   ``Of course I'm really here in support of Chico Mendes,'' he
said. ``But why not make some money while I'm at it?``
   So goes the philosophy of many merchants in this town of 10,000,
swollen now with scores of journalists covering one of Brazil's
most important trials of the decade.
   The trial's objective is to decide who is responsible for the
murder of Mendes in his backyard on the night of Dec. 22, 1988.
   But anything seems fair game for the likeness of the rain forest
defender. Mendes' face appears on buttons, flags, ashtrays, can
openers, T-shirts, caps, and wooden cups. There are even Chico
Mendes Christmas cards going for $3 apiece.
   ``How much?'' asked Ilzamar Mendes, widow of the ecologist and
head of the Chico Mendes Foundation. ``I wouldn't even buy one at
that price.''
   Not many of the rubber tappers that live in this river town can.
The exploitation proves irritating to some. Especially for those
like Luiz Vieira de Souza, a 63-year-old tapper who said he
traveled eight hours in a dugout canoe eating solely manioc root to
get to Xapuri.
   ``This is crazy,'' bristled the leathery-skinned tapper, as he
refused a bottle of mineral water selling for $1. ``I may have to
leave early if my money runs out.''
   Some profiteers are imaginative. One barrel-shaped elderly woman
from Brazil's Atlantic state of Bahia set up a stand in front of
the town courthouse to sell shrimp stew.
   ``Shrimp in the Amazon?'' asked a visitor. The woman smiled.
   ``Yes sir, and just $2 per ladle,'' she said.

   Alan Caruba, a public relations consultant who says he founded

   Nearly 200 friends and public officials
gathered Thursday for the funeral of industrialist Armand Hammer,
the billionaire oilman and philanthropist who was eulogized as a
``dreamer, visionary and doer.''
   The philanthropic, globe-trotting chairman of Occidental
Petroleum Corp. died Monday at age 92.
   Hammer, who built Occidental into the nation's 16th-largest
industrial company, was eulogized as a tireless crusader for world
peace and a confidant of world leaders from Vladimir Lenin to
George Bush.
   ``The United States has suffered a great loss, for he was the
only man in the world that could claim the prominence of being a
world citizen,'' said Louis Nizer, a New York attorney and member
of Occidental's board.
   ``No other person who has lived has ever been able to make such
a claim with so much justification.''
   Others eulogizing Hammer were Mayor Tom Bradley, longtime Hammer
attorney Arthur Groman and Ray R. Irani, Occident's president and
chief operating officer.
   Bradley called Hammer a ``dreamer, visionary and doer.''
   Michael Hammer, son of Hammer's only son, Julian, and an
Occidental vice president, wept as he remembered his grandfather's
love for his great-grandsons, Armand and Victor.
   ``Grandfather, I promise to live my life with the same attention
to fairness and generosity that you did,'' he said.
   The hourlong ceremony at tiny Westwood Memorial Park was
officiated by Rabbi Harvey Fields of Wilshire Boulevard Temple.
   ``Dr. Armand Hammer was one of those few people whose interests
and passions were enough to fill many an album in many a life:
physician, builder of corporations, philantropist, educator, art
collector, defender of human rights, rescue of Soviet Jews,
international peacemaker, warrior against cancer,'' Fields said.
   Inside the cemetery's small chapel, a string quartet played some
of Hammer's favorite music, including ``Lara's Theme'' from the
movie ``Dr. Zhivago,'' recalling Hammer's lifelong association with
the Soviet Union.
   Hammer, the son of the founder of the American Communist Party,
became a millionaire by age 23 and by most estimates died a
billionaire. He made numerous trips to the Soviet Union, forging
close personal, economic and political ties with the country's
leaders. Hammer donated huge sums to charity and cancer research
facilities.
   Also attending the funderal were syndicated columnist Abigail
Van Buren, entertainer Danny Thomas, the Rev. Robert Schuller and
bone marrow transplant specialist Dr. Robert Gale.
   Hammer was interred in the family mausoleum alongside his third
wife, Frances, who died last year.

   The Housatonic Boy Scout Council broke new
ground Thursday when it appointed the first woman scout executive
in the country.
   Mary L. Portis of West Haven will fill the vacancy left by Jack
Ross, who was transferred to the Cape Cod Council.
   ``I have thought for a long time that women can do anything,''
Portis said. ``I am happy that in the 90's a woman can become a
scout executive.''
   Portis, who would be responsible for coordinating scouting in
six cities and towns, was selected from eight finalists.
   ``She was clearly the most qualified candidate,'' council
President John Rak said. ``To us, the fact that she happens to be a
woman is totally irrelevant.''
   There are six Boy Scout councils in the state and about 400 in
the country. The councils, comprised of executives, oversee the
operation of scouting within defined territories.
   In the past, women wrre barred from leadership roles in the
scout organization. But in February 1988 the national council voted
to abolish gender restrictions.
   Portis will begin her new duties Jan. 16.

   A strong earthquake Friday rocked much of
Taiwan, touching off blackouts and landslides in an eastern city
where two people died in a tremor the day before. No new casualties
were immediately reported.
   The Central Weather Bureau said Friday's quake struck at 3:49
a.m. with a preliminary reading of 6.7 on the Richter scale. It hit
Taiwan just 12 hours after a quake of 6.5 jolted the same area.
   The epicenter of Friday's quake was offshore, about 18 miles
southeast of Hualien city in eastern Taiwan.
   Many people were awakened and ran into the streets from their
homes, which shook violently, said Lee Lai-fe, a policeman in
Hualien, 108 miles southeast of Taipei. Three homes burned down
when a power line short-circuited but no one was injured, Lee said.
   Some roads were blocked by landslides, Lee said. Power blackouts
affected a wide area in the city, he added.
   Thursday's tremor killed two workers in Hualien, one falling
from a second floor and another from a building scaffold. Officials
reported cracks in some school buildings.
   More than 200 aftershocks were recorded Thursday and Friday, the
Central Weather Bureau said.
   Friday's quake was the largest to strike Taiwan since a November
1986 tremor of 6.8 on the Richter scale killed 13 people.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one represents a tenfold increase
in intensity.
   An earthquake of 6 can cause severe damage in a populated area.
One of 7 is classified as a major earthquake, capable of causing
widespread, heavy damage.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Beverly Hills To Put Up Christmas Tree Next To
Menorah</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Beverly Hills must install a Christmas tree
next to a 28-foot Hanukkah menorah or move the menorah next to an
existing tree, a federal judge ruled Thursday in a lawsuit between
two Jewish groups.
   U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter said a U.S. Supreme Court
decision concerning religious symbols on public property clearly
allows such displays but only if both the menorah and the Christmas
tree are represented and are close together.
   ``What I am going to order is that the menorah be moved so that
it is next to the tree that has been designated to symbolize a
secular Christmas tree and that no religious ceremonies be held
(there),'' Hatter said.
   Marshall Grossman, an attorney for Chabad, a movement of Hasidic
Jews, said the group paid $25,000 to install the menorah - an array
of nine candles - on a permanent foundation and could not easily
move it.
   Hatter said a large Christmas tree could be brought to the site
and could be lighted next to the menorah.
   ``Your honor, I can probably do that myself,'' said Grossman.
``It may be the first time I've purchased a Christmas tree but I
think I can get rabbinical approval.''
   The American Jewish Congress and four Jewish residents of
Beverly Hills, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, filed
a civil rights lawsuit seeking the menorah's removal. They claimed
that having the menorah on public property was a violation of First
Amendment guarantees of separation of church and state. They also
drew support Thursday from the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations.
   Grossman protested when the judge ruled that no religious
ceremonies could be held in front of the menorah, which stands
across the street from City Hall.
   Hatter denied a request from Beverly Hills attorney Mitchell
Abbott to stay his temporary restraining order from taking effect
until further arguments could be made.
   ACLU lawyers Carol Sobel and Douglas Mirell pressed for quick
action, saying any delay would allow the menorah to stand alone
through the eight-night celebratin of Hanukkah, which began Tuesday
night.
   Although the city has two official Christmas trees and lighted
street decorations, the attorneys said they are not close enough to
the menorah to provide equal representation.
   Hatter suggested that the presence of two symbols might help to
spread holiday cheer.
   ``Our society is in need of any sustenance of a positive
nature,'' the judge said.
   ``The court is abiding by the letter of what the Supreme Court
said,'' ACLU attorney Mirell said outside court. He called the
ruling ``a clear victory'' for the plaintiffs.
   Grossman disagreed.
   ``The net result of this misguided effort ... is that this year
instead of there being two Christmas trees and one menorah in
Beverly Hills, there will now be an additional Christmas tree,'' he
said.

   Six people were killed and nine
injured in a collision between a small bus and a tractor-trailer
rig early Friday in far northern Australia, police said.
   The Stuart highway, the main road across Australia's desolate
Outback midsection, was blocked by wreckage from the bus and a
tractor-trailer rig carrying several trailers.
   Darwin police said earlier that eight people were confirmed dead
but revised the toll after consulting with local authorities.
Katherine police said four of the nine injured were trapped in the
wreckage for about two hours. They were taken to Katherine Hospital
in serious condition.
   Several of the casualties were children, officials said.

   A Nobel Peace Prize-winning group of physicians
announced plans Thursday to send a delegation to the Persian Gulf
to address the medical consequences of a war and possibly meet with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   ``They are not our enemy. We are not their enemy. The enemy is
war,'' said Dr. Bernard Lown, co-president of the International
Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.
   Lown said the delegation is making the peace trip after appeals
from Egypt, Jordan and a ``very insistent'' invitation from Iraq.
   The organization, which was founded 10 years ago and represents
more than 200,000 doctors worldwide, was awarded the Nobel peace
Prize in 1985 for its contributions to lessen the tensions of the
Cold War.
   Lown said the Iraqi request came from Abbas Takriti, the
president of the Iraqi medical association.
   The physicians were expected to fly to the region Friday and
meet with officials in Cairo, Amman and Baghdad during the eight
day trip. Besides Saddam, the group also hoped for meetings with
King Hussein of Jordan and President Mubarek of Egypt.
   Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait Aug. 2. Since then, troops from
the United States and other countries have been poised in Saudi
Arabia.
   The U.N. Security Council has set a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to
relinquish Kuwait or face possible attack.
   The leaders in the Persian Gulf region are concerned because if
war should break out, the greatest number of casualties probably
would be civilians, Lown said.
   The group to visit the Persian Gulf includes: Lown; Dr. John
Pastore, the secretary of the IPPNW; Dr. Ulrich Gottstein of
Germany, the IPPNW's vice-president for Europe; Dr. Sergei
Kolesnikov of the Soviet Union, a president of the USSR Academy of
Medical Sciences; and William Monning, the IPPNW's executive
director.
   Lown said the primary message the physicians hope to send is
peace.
   ``We believe that if our mission helps to educate the word about
the tragic human costs that will result from a war, peace will
become a greater imperative,'' he said.

   A jury Thursday convicted a paroled child
killer of murdering 10 women during the past two years, rejecting
arguments that he was insane.
   The Monroe County Court jury deliberated 6{ hours over two days
before deciding Arthur J. Shawcross was guilty of 10 counts of
second-degree murder.
   There is no first-degree murder charge in New York state. Jurors
could have convicted Showcross of manslaughter
   Shawcross, 45, was arrested Jan. 4, a day after state police
spotted him near the frozen body of one of the victims. He
confessed to the crimes during police questioning. At the time, he
was on parole for a 1972 slaying.
   The women were slain between March 1988 and January 1990.
   Nine of Shawcross' victims were prostitutes and all frequented
the streets of downtown Rochester. Most were strangled and their
bodies left hidden along the Genesee River or in other secluded
locations.
   Shawcross showed no reaction as the verdict was read. He faces a
trial in neighboring Wayne County next year for the slaying of
29-year-old Elizabeth Gibson.
   After the verdict, relatives of the victims swarmed around
Assistant District Attorney Charles Siragusa. Many had tears in
their eyes as they hugged and shook hands with the prosecutor.
   Siragusa ``did a 100 percent job,'' said Pattie Trippi, whose
sister Darlene was slain. ``I'm just glad the verdict was murder.
That's justice. I hope he's never, ever let out.''
   Jackie Dennis, aunt of victim Maria Welch, said she attended the
trial because she hoped it would help ease the pain of her niece's
death.
   She said she was relieved by the verdict, ``but nothing's going
to bring Maria back.''
   Shawcross faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life on each
of the 10 counts. He will be sentenced Feb. 1 by Judge Donald J.
Wisner.
   Defense lawyer Thomas Cocuzzi said he would appeal the
conviction. The defense had asked for a mistrial on the grounds
that statements by its own witness, psychiatrist Dr. Dorothy Lewis,
had biased jurors. Wisner denied the motion.
   ``I'm disappointed but I'm not going to criticize this jury,''
Cocuzzi said. ``Whether or not he had a fair trial is up to an
appellate court.''
   In 1972 Shawcross confessed to strangling 8-year-old Karen Ann
Hill and served 15 years in prison before being released on parole
in 1987. He had also confessed to the 1972 killing of 10-year-old
Jack Blake in Watertown but was not prosecuted because of
insufficient evidence.
   Karen's mother, Helene Hill, was in the court Thursday. As the
prosecutor left the courtroom, she embraced him. ``This is the
greatest Christmas present we all could receive,'' she said,
fighting back tears.
   During the trial, Lewis testified that Shawcross suffered from
brain damage and post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by
childhood abuse and traumatic experiences in Vietnam. Shawcross did
not testify, but jurors watched videotapes of him being interviewed
under hypnosis by Lewis.
   Prosecution psychiatrist Dr. Park Dietz argued that Shawcross
was faking mental illness to avoid being sent to prison.
   Jury foreman Robert Edwards said the jurors were not convinced
either by the insanity claim.
   ``We didn't buy it,'' he said. ``The evidence they had for it
was very poor, and there was too much evidence against it that was
very good.''

   A small earthquake shook farmland near
this desert community Thursday, but caused no damage, authorities
said.
   An earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale was recorded at
10:59 a.m. by the seismology station at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   The epicenter was located five miles southwest of Niland, near
the eastern edge of the Salton Sea, said Caltech spokesman Robert
Finn.
   Imperial County Sheriff's Deputy Greg Dinsmore said the area
consists primarily of farmland and there are few residences or
buildings. He said his office received no calls from residents
about the temblor.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area.

<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission on
Thursday tightened radiation-exposure limits for nuclear plant
workers and residents near atomic power facilities. The revision
was the first in more than 30 years.
   The agency said the new regulations, by reflecting recent
scientific studies, will provide an extra margin of safety. Yet,
the commission said, the current standards do not put workers at
risk.
   Anti-nuclear groups immediately criticized the new regulation,
which does not take effect for two years. Critics argued that the
tightened limits still put people at too high a risk of cancer and
are based on outdated health information.
   ``The commission is straining its credibility by adopting an
obsolete standard,'' said the Nuclear Information and Resource
Service, an anti-nuclear umbrella group. It said the new standards
reflect recommendations made by leading scientists 13 years ago.
   The NRC's revised standards, approved unanimously by the
commission, will replace radiation-exposure limits in effect since
1957 for atomic plant workers and people living near nuclear
facilities.
   The new rules require that, by January 1993, the nuclear
industry assure that:
   -The maximum exposure to the general population from atomic
facilities be no more than 100 millirems a year, a fifth of what is
now allowed.
   -Atomic workers be exposed to no more than 5 rems of radiation a
year. Now, some workers can be exposed to four times that amount
under certain conditions, an NRC official said.
   -Plant operators be required to adopt policies keeping radiation
doses ``as low as reasonably achievable'' instead of merely being
urged to do so, as is now the law.
   According to government studies, the average American can expect
to be exposed to about 360 millirems of radiation from various
sources a year. Radiation from an X-ray is about 6 to 7 millirems.
   Atomic plant workers on average are exposed to an additional 400
millirems or so annually, although that amount can be considerably
higher, NRC officials said.
   The new rules also establish tighter exposure standards for
pregnant workers at atomic facilities, limiting exposure to 500
millirems over the course of the pregnancy.
   A rem, which is the standard measure of radiation, equals 1,000
millirems.
   The new rules ``reflect changes in the basic philosophy of
radiation protection'' and provide ``a substantial increase in
safety,'' said Donald Cool, chief of the NRC's radiation protection
and health effects branch.
   The requirements will affect commercial nuclear plants, various
laboratories and facilities involved in uranium production.
   Cool said most of the nuclear industry has procedures in place
aimed at meeting the tighter standards, although some
uranium-processing facilities may have to alter their operating
procedures.
   The cost of compliance for the nuclear industry was estimated at
$170 million.
   The new requirements are based on recommendations to limit
radiation exposure made by the International Commission on
Radiological Protection in 1977.
   Critics questioned whether the new requirements will make
working conditions safer for plant workers and nearby residents.
   A part of the rules, some methods for calculating exposure
levels were changed to allow the release of increased
concentrations of many radioisotopes as long as exposure doses
remain within the required limits.
   Cool said these changes reflect new scientific information on
radiation and do not pose increased health risks. But Michael
Mariotte, executive director of the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service, argued that the higher concentrations that will
be released actually amount to the NRC ``increasing allowable
radiation levels'' instead of providing additional safeguards.
   Mariotte also questioned the NRC's use of 1977 recommendations
when the same international organization is due to recommend
tougher standards with months.
   Last June, the international group said it is planning to
recommend that workers' radiation exposure be limited to no more
than 2 rems per year, instead of the 5 rems included in the new NRC
rules.
   The NRC said it didn't believe the imposition of a 2
rem-per-year ceiling for atomic workers was needed. In 1987, said
the agency, 97 percent of all workers at nuclear plants and other
atomic facilities were exposed to less than 2 rems of radiation
annually.

<HEAD>Hispanics Seek Delay in Chicago Aldermanic Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hispanic groups filed a lawsuit Thursday seeking
to delay election of aldermen until after the city redistricts the
wards they represent.
   The federal lawsuit alleges that the city's plan to redistrict
after the Feb. 26 aldermanic elections dilutes the strength of
Hispanic voters.
   ``The current schedule in effect creates a system where the
aldermen don't represent the districts they're elected to,'' said
Rubin Castillo, director of the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund, one of the lawsuit's plaintiffs.
   Other plaintiffs are the League of Women Voters, the Puerto
Rican Parade Committee, the Spanish Action Committee of Chicago and
10 individuals. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court on
behalf of Latino and other registered voters.
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, a defendant in the lawsuit, opposes
postponing the aldermanic elections because he believes it will be
too costly to elect alderman and city officials at separate times,
his press secretary said.
   ``The mayor's position is that the whole matter is something to
be decided by the courts,'' said press secretary Avis LaVelle.
``But he believes it makes more sense to have the elections go on
as planned.''
   Daley is seeking re-election in February. Candidates for
aldermen are seeking four-year terms.
   Castillo said 1990 U.S. Census figures are expected to show
400,000 more Hispanics living in the city now than in 1980.
   ``Those voters won't have a say in electing their aldermen until
1995 under the current schedule,'' Castillo said.
   The lawsuit seeks to force the city to redistrict as soon as
census data become available in March or April. The elections could
be held after the information is released, Castillo said.

<TEXT>
   A company that once beamed pornographic
movies via satellite to television viewers pleaded guilty to a
second federal charge, prosecutors said.
   Home Dish Only Satellite Networks Inc. will pay a $150,000 fine
and has stipulated that movies it distributed via satellite, such
as ``Hard Core Girlfriends'' and ``Ramb-Ohh Sex Platoon,'' were
pornographic by community standards, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Richard Lambert said Wednesday.
   The movies were beamed to 30,000 subscribers to its American
Exxxtasy Channel.
   Company attorneys appeared Wednesday before U.S. District Judge
Aldon Anderson. They entered the plea to a count of distribution of
obscene matter via satellite transmission.
   As part of the plea bargain, company operators Paul L. Klein and
Jeffrey Younger have promised to refrain from promoting or
distributing sexually explicit films or publications and will
cooperate with investigators looking into the pornography industry,
Lambert said.
   The company pleaded guilty to a similar charge Nov. 29 in
Buffalo, N.Y.
   Until investigators pulled the plug on the operation last March,
Home Dish was the only nationwide satellite network beaming
hard-core pornography to home television viewers, the Justice
Department said.
   The movies were transmitted from the company's Buffalo office to
a satellite uplink station operated by U.S. Satellite Inc. in
Murray, Utah, which in turn relayed them to a satellite.
   In Salt Lake, the company pleaded guilty for the Feb. 26
transmission of the movie ``Hard Core Girlfriends,'' Lambert said.
The charge in New York stemmed from the transmission a day earlier
of a movie entitled ``Hot Shorts.''
   U.S. Attorney Dee Benson in Utah said U.S. Satellite was not
prosecuted because it cooperated with the investigation.
   Benson said Klein and Younger were not prosecuted individually
because of their willingness to stay out of the business and
cooperate with a Department of Justice's investigation into the
pornography industry.

   A jury Thursday acquitted a truck driver of
negligent homicide in a fiery interstate accident that left eight
people dead.
   The six-member Braxton County Magistrate Court jury deliberated
just over two hours before clearing Manuel Cruzado Jr., 26, of
Buffalo, N.Y., of the misdemeanor counts.
   ``I just want to go home,'' Cruzado said as he left the
courtroom.
   ``I can't say I was surprised. The state has a pretty heavy
burden of proof in these cases,'' prosecutor Bill Martin said.
   Cruzado's loaded car-carrier smashed into a car that was stalled
in traffic at a construction site on Interstate 79 on July 26. A
second car was crushed when a vehicle fell off Cruzado's
car-carrier and landed on top of it.
   A family of five from New York was killed in one car. Three
Fairmont residents died in the other car.
   Earlier Thursday, Cruzado testified that his brakes failed and
said he couldn't avoid smashing into the two cars. His attorney
argued there was insufficient warning of the construction ahead.
   Prosecutors contended Cruzado ignored warning signs and was
going faster than the speed limit.
   Cruzado still faces more than $30 million in civil lawsuits
filed against him by relatives of the victims.

   A former bus driver whose passengers
revolted over his allegedly erratic behavior pleaded innocent
Thursday to drunken driving and breaking the jaw of a rider who
tried to take the wheel.
   Kenneth Webb, 34, pulled his jacket over his head and kept it
there when he appeared before Municipal Court Judge Gerald Belleci.
   Webb pleaded innocent to charges of battery, misdemeanor drunken
driving and having an open container of alcohol in the bus. He was
held on $5,000 bail.
   Passengers told police that for 20 uncertain minutes the night
of Nov. 29, Webb drove them through Concord, running a stop sign
and narrowly missing a pedestrian. Several of the 12 passengers
tried to take control of the bus.
   When passenger Sam Kaiser Jr., 28, tried to wrestle Webb out of
the driver's seat, Webb allegedly punched Kaiser and broke his jaw.
   Webb was arrested after the California Highway Patrol, transit
police and Laidlaw Transit Co. employees converged on the stopped
bus.
   The route Webb was driving was an express shuttle between
Concord and Brentwood, communities about 10 miles apart and both
about 30 miles northeast of Oakland.

   A 38-year-old South Carolina man
pleaded innocent Thursday to charges of murdering two hikers on a
remote stretch of the Appalachian Trail.
   Paul David Crews, 38, is accused of the Sept. 13 shooting and
stabbing deaths of Geoffrey Logan Hood and Molly LaRue, both 26, as
they slept in a wooden shelter near Duncannon, about 15 miles
northwest of Harrisburg.
   Crews, from Loris, S.C., was picked up in Harpers Ferry, W.Va.,
shortly after Pennsylvania police circulated a composite drawing of
a suspect.
   Hikers had tipped police about Crews because he had an
overstuffed backpack that he was not carrying like an experienced
hiker, said Brian King, a spokesman for the Appalachian Trail
Conference in Harpers Ferry.
   James LaRue, father of one of the victims, said police told him
Crews was carrying Hood's hiking gear and wearing his boots when he
was arrested.
   Perry County District Attorney R. Scott Cramer said he would
seek the death penalty against Crews.
   Defense lawyer Shaubut Walz III said he would ask that the trial
be held outside of Perry County because of extensive publicity.
   Crews, held without bail, is also wanted in connection with a
1986 knife-slaying of a 56-year-old woman in Florida, police said.
Walz said no charges have been filed against Crews in the Florida
case.

<TEXT>
   Prisoner rights don't extend to playing the
Illinois Lottery, a federal appeals court has ruled.
   Jessie Hach, 38, serving a life sentence at Menard Correctional
Center for murder and armed robbery, contended prison officials had
unfairly denied him permission to play the lottery by mail.
   Hatch filed a civil-rights lawsuit in 1988 when he was an inmate
at Stateville prison near Joliet.
   A three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled Tuesday that playing the lottery is a privilege, not a right.
The decision upheld an earlier ruling by a district judge.
   Corrections officials cited security concerns and prison rules
against gambling. Salvador Godinez, then an assistant warden at
Stateville prison, told the district judge that lottery
subscriptions would be another vehicle for inmate barter and might
lead to thefts and extortion.
   Hatch contended that sending money to play the lottery was no
different than sending money earned at prison jobs to invest in
stocks, bonds or savings accounts.
   The court disagreed.
   ``Once prison officials allow inmates to have some personal
property or to engage in some financial transactions, they should
not be powerless to draw the line,'' the court's opinion said.

<HEAD>Report: Peres Says Trailers Built in West Bank for Immigrants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said Thursday
he was checking reports that hundreds of trailer homes were being
moved to the occupied territories, possibly to house Soviet
immigrants, Israeli media reported.
   The national Itim news agency said Housing Minister Ariel Sharon
insisted Israel was abiding by promises to the United States not to
send immigrants to the West Bank or Gaza Strip.
   The United States has conditioned $400 million in housing loan
guarantees for immigration on the funds not being spent on building
homes in the occupied territories.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir asked for additional financial
help to accommodate the immigration wave in his talks with U.S.
leaders in Washington this week.
   Israel television and Itim quoted Peres as telling left-leaning
Labor's 120-member Leadership Bureau he heard the government was
erecting hundreds of trailer homes in the West Bank.
   Itim said Peres added he was checking these reports, without
elaborating on their source.
   ``Once the trailers are built there they will say, we have no
choice, the immigrants have no place to live, and then they will be
forced to move there,'' Peres reportedly added.
   More than 155,000 Soviet immigrants have arrived this year and
the influx has created a national housing shortage.
   Sharon, of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc, accused Peres of
speaking ``out of internal political and personal considerations
and trying to place obstacles'' to the immigration effort.
   ``The government has clearly stated we are settling immigrants
in united Jerusalem and Galilee and the Negev (desert). We are not
sending immigrants to Judea, Samaria and Gaza,'' Sharon said, using
biblical names for the West Bank.
   It is ``not because we have changed our strategic thinking about
these areas, but so as not to harm the immigration,'' Sharon said,
in a statement published by Itim.
   Israel has settled about 100,000 Jews in the West Bank and Gaza
since capturing them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war. These territories are home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   The Likud holds these areas are integral parts of historic
Israel. Labor believes some of the lands should be relinquished as
part of a peace settlement with Arab neighbors.

   The Kremlin on Thursday postponed a new round of
talks on Lithuanian independence, said officials of the Baltic
republic.
   No new date for the third round of talks was set. The talks with
Lithuanian officials had been scheduled to start Friday.
   The Lithuanian side said Vitaly Doguzhiyev, a deputy to Soviet
Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, sent a telegram to the Lithuanian
delegation informing it of the delay. Ryzhkov heads the Soviet
side.
   No reason for the postponement was given.
   Lithuania declared independence March 11, but it has suspended
the action in exchange for negotiations with the Kremlin and the
lifting of a crippling economic embargo.
   Lithuanian officials in the past have accused the Kremlin of
deliberately delaying the talks.

   There may not be a more magical moment in
musical theater than the end of the first act of ``Peter Pan.''
   When the boy who refuses to grow up flies off to Neverland with
three very proper English children, theatergoers usually soar right
along with them. A good test of any production is how well this
enchanting scene is done.
   Well, fans of Sandy Duncan and even Mary Martin can rest easy.
This latest revival, which opened Thursday at Broadway's
Lunt-Fontanne Theater after a year-long national tour, does just
fine.
   That comes as something of a surprise because the show's star,
Cathy Rigby, is a performer better known for her gymnastic ability
- she was an Olympic gold medal winner in 1972 - than for her
acting, singing and dancing. But Rigby is something of a
revelation.
   She certainly flies faster, higher and with more grace than any
of her predecessors. What's more unexpected is that Rigby is
completely at home on a Broadway stage. She's a good singer with a
strong, clear voice, able to negotiate the obvious show-stoppers -
``I Gotta Crow'' and ``I'm Flying'' - as well as more heart-tugging
songs such as ``Distant Melody.''
   Rigby is a spunky actress. Her Peter Pan is a rough and tumble,
cocky kid. That brash physicality not only helps her do battle with
all those pirates and Indians but also helps in forming a
distinctive character, the tough little boy afraid to show any
emotion or accept responsibility.
   Rigby has a dastardly and very funny opponent is Stephen Hanan,
whose Capt. Hook is extravagant without being campy. Cindy Robinson
exudes a lady-like bossiness as Wendy, while Britt West and Chad
Hutchison are believable as her two brothers.
   Director Fran Soder gives the show a sharper, darker tinge than
previous productions had. The audience is aware of the double edge
of J.M. Barrie's story. It's fun not to grow up, but there's no
way, unless you're Peter Pan, that you can avoid it.
   The wonderful score, a joint effort by Moose Charlap and Carolyn
Leigh and Jule Styne and Betty Comden and Adolph Green, remains a
joy. It's a rare collection of songs that both children and adults
can enjoy.
   If the new choreography by Marilyn Magness doesn't make you
forget Jerome Robbins' original contributions, at least it's lively
and occasionally funny.
   The production, especially the exotic greenery of Neverland,
looks spiffy, not like a thinned-out touring company that has been
on the road too long. All of this wouldn't matter if the producers
hadn't found a high-flying Pan. But they have, one whose swoops,
dips and soarings are actually heart-stopping.
   One more thing. Wait for the final curtain call. Rigby does more
than zoom around the stage. She takes her mid-air magic right out
over the audience.

   An Army soldier fell to his death in a
cave Thursday while helping wildlife researchers look for an
endangered salamander species, officials said.
   ``Four individuals were out doing some environmental-type
endeavors. One of the individuals fell into a cave, supposedly
anywhere from 80 to 100 feet,'' said Sgt. Maj. Raymond Morris of
Fort Sam Houston.
   The four were preparing to descend into the cave, which had a
steep vertical drop, when the soldier fell into it, officials said.
He first fell about 15 feet, then for some reason released his
safety rope and fell the rest of the way into the cave, officials
said.
   Morris identified the soldier as Murray Elson III, 40. His body
was recovered from the cave about 2{ hours after the accident.
   The other three people on the expedition were an employee of the
Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife, a University of Texas
graduate student and a civilian worker employed at Camp Bullis,
Morris said.
   Bexar County fire and rescue units were called to the scene to
help.
   Soldiers at Fort Sam Houston routinely do training at Camp
Bullis, north of San Antonio. The wooded area where the cave is
located is about 12 miles inside Camp Bullis.
   Officials at the military camp referred all questions to
officials at Fort Sam Houston.
   Morris said Elson was a non-commissioned officer who had been on
similar expeditions in the past, although he had not assisted the
salamander researchers before.

<HEAD>Cookies For Soldiers Given To Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two women who baked cookies for troops
stationed in the Persian Gulf are fuming because the sweets ended
up in California homeless shelters.
   Gina Root and Deborah Lien of Corvallis spent about $75 to send
150 pounds of cookies about three weeks ago to Stephen Butler in La
Mesa, Calif. The women thought the cookies would soon be on a
flight to the Gulf.
   This week, Root received a letter from a volunteer in a homeless
shelter in La Mesa thanking her for the donation.
   ``I'm furious,'' Root said Thursday. ``These cookies are for our
service people, not for the homeless in California. It just
stinks.''
   Butler said he distributed the cookies and many others he
received to homeless shelters because he was deluged with treats
for the troops and never intended to become the national organizer
of Operation Cookie.
   He said he volunteered to organize the local Los Angeles cookie
effort, but after talking to a reporter and the story being picked
up by newspapers across the country he was covered up in cookies.
   For weeks, his living room has been full of cookies.
   Root said if Butler had more cookies than he could handle, he
should have refused to accept shipment.
   Butler said he ``scrounged'' to find a way to get the cookies
overseas. He said military planes take the cookies only on a
space-available basis, and most flights have been full.
   ``It was either give them to homeless shelters or throw them in
the trash,'' Butler said.
   He said he thought the honorable thing to do was to give the
cookies to shelters.
   ``I've been deluged by angry old ladies giving me tons of
suggestions of what I should have done with the cookies,'' he said.
``From now on, I'll just let them spoil or throw them away. I'm fed
up with it.''

   Wendell Shroyer was driving along a scenic
stretch of Interstate 75 when the road suddenly was obscured by
thick fog. His thoughts of visiting relatives in Florida were
interrupted by screams.
   ``I'll never forget it. I heard someone screaming from
underneath a truck,'' said Shroyer, of Battle Creek, Mich.
   Before the fog had lifted Tuesday morning, there were more than
80 wrecked cars, 13 people killed and more than 50 injured.
   The drive between Knoxville and Chattanooga rolls along in view
of hills that descend from the southern Appalachians. Dairy and
cattle farms line both sides of the highway.
   On some warm mornings fog rises off the Hiwassee River and
blankets the highway near this town 40 miles northeast of
Chattanooga, producing a sense of solitude.
   Tuesday's fog produced fear and chaos.
   ``I came into the fog and couldn't see 10 feet in front of me,''
said Virgil Metts, a Tennessee Valley Authority employee from
Knoxville who was traveling to Chattanooga.
   Motorists said the fog rose like a wall as they approached the
Calhoun exit on the heavily traveled highway.
   Federal investigators said they would look into whether a nearby
paper mill's steam emissions contributed to the heavy fog, although
the stretch of highway is notorious for thick pockets of fog.
   Investigators are seeking information from motorists who drive
the highway regularly and are familiar with its conditions, said
Robert Barlett, head of the National Transportation Safety Board
team reviewing the crash.
   The team has talked with 14 people involved in the crash and
scheduled interviews with 25 others, Barlett said at a briefing
Thursday.
   Barlett said that the quick response of rescue and cleanup teams
made it hard to reconstruct the accident because most evidence had
been removed by time investigators arrived. But he emphasized that
this was not a criticism: ``Your first priority in any accident is
to rescue your survivors immediately. That takes precedence over
everything.''
   Five of the 13 victims were still unidentified Thursday, said
Dr. Iris Snider, assistant McMinn County coroner.
   A chain-reaction crash in the same area in 1978 involved 61
vehicles and injured 46 people. Three people were killed and 14
injured in a 1979 accident involving 18 vehicles.
   On Tuesday brakes screeched and tires squealed as drivers saw
tail lights flicker ahead of them.
   And then the damp, gray air was filled with the violent sound of
cars, pickups and tractor-trailer rigs smashing into each other and
bursting into flames, the travelers said.
   ``For three minutes after I stopped, cars kept hitting each
other,'' said Metts. ``They kept driving into the fog at 60 mph.
   ``It was deadly silent - a real eerie silence. You couldn't see
anything because of the fog, and all you heard was exploding gas
tanks.''
   Clyde Wilder of Knoxville and Mark Compton of Greeneville,
Tenn., were headed south in a tractor-trailer when a voice on their
citizens band radio warned of ``a real bad wreck'' ahead.
   `Somebody hit the fog and somebody hit their brakes and it just
started piling up,'' Compton said.
   Those who were able leaped from their cars and jumped into the
median, and tried to help those who weren't. Wails from the injured
filled the smoky air. Some of those who were rescued had to be
restrained from returning to their smashed vehicles.
   George and Margaret Dawson were southbound, moving from Michigan
to Florida to retire. Their mini-van was loaded with valuables they
didn't trust to the movers. Seconds later, those valuables were
scattered across the highway.
   ``We came on it so fast - but we still managed to stop before
hitting the car in front of us,'' said Mrs. Dawson. ``My husband
got out, and I was trying to get out and my husband yelled, `Get
back in and brace yourself!'
   ``The whole back of the van is gone. But after seeing some of
the other people, we consider ourselves lucky. What a way to start
retirement.''

   Federal safety officials indicated Thursday that
failed brakes may have caused a derailment that sent an Amtrak
train slamming into a commuter train, injuring 264 people.
   An apprentice engineer operating the Amtrak train told
investigators he tried three times to apply the brakes as the Night
Owl from Washington approached Boston's Back Bay station, said
Susan Coughlin, vice chairwoman of the National Transportation
Safety Board.
   ``It is his opinion that the brakes failed to set up properly to
slow the train,'' Coughlin said at a news conference Thursday
night.
   The engineer trainee, Richard Abramson, also told authorities
that the senior engineer Willis Copeland tried to stop the train
using emergency brakes, Coughlin said.
   Coughlin said time recorders showed the train was traveling an
average of 91.8 mph over the last mile of its trip between the
Ruggles and Back Bay stations. The two stations are about one mile
apart.
   Before the Ruggles station, the train could safely travel 100
mph, but at the point where the train derailed approaching Back
Bay, it should have been traveling 30 mph, Coughlin said.
   However, Coughlin said it was still unclear exactly how fast the
train was traveling when it derailed.
   ``The last time he (Abramson) looked at the speedometer, he was
going between 60 and 70 mph,'' Coughlin said, adding that it was
still unclear what point that was.
   It was the first time Copeland had taken over operation of a
regular train run, authorities said.
   The investigators worked under a temporary brace put up Thursday
to bolster the tunnel ceiling, which ruptured when the Amtrak
engine jackknifed on impact.
   Federal investigators have conducted drug and alcohol tests on
crews of both trains, as is routine after crashes. They also
planned to see if the tracks conformed to the proper gauge size and
check maintenance records.
   They will also document what happened to the seats, walls, food
equipment and other equipment on the trains to look at how they
withstood the impact.
   Wednesday's morning rush-hour crash in the Back Bay Station
injured 264 people. Fifteen people spent the night in hospitals.
Four were still in intensive care Thursday.
   Thomas Glynn, general manager of the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority, said he expected eight people to remain
hospitalized Thursday night, with one remaining in intensive care.
   The National Transportation Safety Board review will examine
recorders to determine the precise speed, brake patterns and
throttle position of the Amtrak train when it derailed and struck
the Stoughton Line train as it sat on an adjacent track, said NTSB
Vice Chairman Susan Coughlin.
   Federal Railroad Administrator Gil Carmichael said factors
generally involved in derailments include faulty track, an
obstruction, speed, faulty signals and human error.
   ``An engineer has to have knowledge of the laws of physics. It's
not a matter of being able to drive the train, it's a matter of
being able to brake the train,'' he said.
   ``It's pretty hard to derail a train,'' Carmichael said.
   Responding to published reports the train was traveling at least
twice the 30 mph limit in station when it derailed on a curve,
Coughlin said he was not prepared to saying how fast the train was
going.
   The Amtrak train, however, was running about six minutes ahead
of time, Glynn said.
   ``All indications I would have had is that it was running a few
minutes early,'' Glynn said.
   Coughlin said she was not disturbed to learn that an apprentice,
Abramson, 41, was running the train.
   ``What we'll be doing is look at the training that was provided
the apprentice engineer and deciding whether that complies with the
federal administration guidelines on trains,'' Coughlin said.
   Sue Martin, public relations director for Amtrak in Washington,
said Abramson started on-the-job training this week. She said his
previous experience included three years as a hostler, moving
trains about the yard in New Haven. She said he also had experience
on a train simulator at the Illinois Institute of Technology. But
this week was the first time Abramson took controls on a regular
train route.
   He was operating the train under the supervision of 25-year
veteran engineer Willis Copeland. Because of that, Amtrak has said
it does not believe inexperience caused the crash.
   Abramson was listed in fair condition in St. Elizabeth's
hospital Thursday. Copeland, 53, was in stable condition at Boston
City Hospital.
   The trains drove through concrete and metal support beams that
held up the tunnel roof, cracking the roadway above.
   Three tracks were damaged and considerable wreckage from the two
trains remained in the tunnel Thursday.
   The accident caused $3.1 million in damage to MBTA equipment,
Glynn said, adding that Amtrak damage was ``extensive.''
   A local subway running through the station was operating
Thursday. Crews worked to restore full service to lines from south
of the city by Monday, Glynn said.

   WASHINGTON - President Bush will go to Moscow for his fourth
summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Februay and is helping the
Soviet leader feed his people with up to $1 billion in credit to
purchase food.
   The deliveries could be on their way within two months, even as
bitter winter deepens the hardships the Soviets are experiencing as
Gorbachev tries to lead them from communism to a market economy.
   ``I want perestroika (restructuring) to succeed,'' Bush said
Wednesday as he announced what the White House described as the
largest initial assistance package the United States has ever
offered any country.
   Standing at the president's side, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze acknowledged his nation is going through rough
times. But, he said, ``the Soviet people will cope with the
problems.''
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON - The Soviet Union appears to have softened its
demand that Israel accept an international peace conference with
the Arabs.
   But the Kremlin is still balking at resuming full diplomatic
relations with the Jewish state, which it severed 23 years ago in a
show of solidarity with Israel's Arab neighbors.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir discussed their relationship at a
previously unscheduled meeting Wednesday. Most of the session was
devoted to discussion of the Persian Gulf crisis and the settlement
of the Arab-Israeli dispute, Shevardnadze said.
   The Soviets, who asked for the meeting with Shamir, have been
eager to carve a bigger role in Mideast diplomacy, which has
traditionally been conducted under U.S. auspices.

   BOSTON - Scientists today reported some of the strongest
evidence yet that red meat significantly raises the risk of colon
cancer.
   The research found that people who eat beef, pork or lamb every
day are more than twice as likely to get colon cancer as those who
avoid red meat. Even those who have meat occasionally raise their
risk somewhat, the study said.
   The findings came as no surprise to health experts who have been
urging reduced red meat consumption for years because of its links
to heart disease and cancer, but the new study solidifies beliefs
about its cancer effects.
   ``Moderate red meat intake is certainly better than large
amounts, but it's quite possible that no red meat intake is even
better,'' said Dr. Walter C. Willett, who directed the study at
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
   ---&equals;
   BOSTON - An apprentice engineer was at the controls - and
reportedly speeding - when his Amtrak train jumped the tracks in a
station and slammed into a rush-hour commuter train, injuring 264
people, authorities said.
   Published reports today said the Amtrak train was traveling at
least twice the 30 mph limit in Back Bay Station when it crashed
Wednesday morning. One report also said the apprentice had started
operating trains on regular runs only on Monday.
   Amtrak denied inexperience caused the crash. Investigators
wouldn't speculate on the cause.
   Amtrak's Night Owl from Washington traveled nearly a quarter
mile after derailing, then struck the rear of the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority train, said Thomas Glynn, MBTA general
manager.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON - President Bush fired Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos because he did not make enough progress in education - an
area the president named as a high priority for his administration,
a source says.
   Chief of staff John H. Sununu personally informed Cavazos of the
firing a day before the secretary's departure was announced
Wednesday, said another source, a White House official who insisted
on anonymity. An education official with ties to the White House
said Cavazos had been given until the end of the month to quit.
   Several possible successors have been suggested, with Lynne
Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities,
singled out as the frontrunner. The National Conservative
Foundation already has sent Bush a letter recommending Cheney.
   Deputy Education Secretary Ted Sanders is serving as acting
secretary, and sources said he has been lobbying for the
nomination.

   VIENNA, Austria - Trying to force a democratic opening,
thousands of Albanians have formed the country's first
non-Communist political party and say they'll challenge the ruling
party in February elections.
   University students, whose protests led to formation of the
Democratic Party of Albania on Wednesday, said they would go to the
Justice Ministry today in an effort to register the first legal
opposition to the Communists.
   But it was uncertain whether legal status would immediately be
granted for the party, proclaimed during a rally Wednesday in the
capital, Tirana.
   Zamira Koleze, a correspondent for official Albanian Radio, said
by telephone that people shouted ``We want democracy,'' and ``Viva
democratic Albania'' during the hour-long rally in University
Square.
   ---&equals;
   LORTON, Va. - America's newest national newspaper is edited by
an ex-convict for those who are still behind bars. Its avowed aim:
to help them stay out when they get out.
   The first issue of Inside Journal, a project of Watergate figure
Charles Colson's Prison Fellowship organization, is in the mail for
distribution to inmates from California to Connecticut.
   The eight-page paper - beginning as a quarterly with the aim of
monthly publication by 1992 - got generally good marks during a
sneak preview this week in the chapel of the District of Columbia's
suburban Lorton Reformatory.
   One inmate, Garfield Wells, who said he had been in another
prison before Lorton, asked whether the paper would take on touchy
issues such as prisoner complaints about the quality of medical
care and food.

<HEAD>Joe Franklin: Showbiz Legend? TV Icon? Kewpie Doll?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big National Debt Clock slowly ticks off the
trillions outside the shabby old building off Times Square where
Joe Franklin, dean of TV talk show hosts, presides over the
moldering chaos that is his office.
   ``I've had a lot of proteges,'' Franklin tells an interviewer in
the hall outside his office. ``People who I've given exposure to.
Most of them don't come back because I symbolize to them the time
when they were broke.''
   The interview is in the hall because there isn't room for two
people to sit down in his memorabilia-crammed cubicle. Leaning,
12-foot stacks of 16mm movie cans, show bills, junk and thousands
of record albums overwhelm the visitor.
   See the incredible office Sunday on ``A Day in the Life of Joe
Franklin,'' a droll, Ha! The Comedy Channel special on a unique
showbiz legend, a charming eccentric and perhaps even a tragic
figure of the medium that created him.
   ``I think I did the first talk show in history,'' he said. ``I
really think I did.'' These days his show on New Jersey
superstation WWOR reaches an estimated 12 million households in the
small hours of the night.
   He is a small man, and his round plump, baby face and elaborate
comb-over hairstyle are unmistakable. He's been spoofed by
comedians, blasted for smarmy, unilluminating interviews. Other
shows and hosts are far more successful.
   And yet he has outlasted them all.
   In New York City alone, he said, 400 talk show hosts have come
and gone since he began.
   ``I never had a manager, I never had an agent, I was never part
of the machine,'' he said. ``If I was part of the machine, I'd be
worth $80 million today. ... I'm the last of the mom and pop candy
stores.''
   The United States was a creditor nation when Franklin began his
talk show in November 1951. The Guinness Book notes that on June 1,
1986, he presented his 21,700th show. He's probably put more than
1,000 in the can since then and reckons he's had 178,000 guests.
   That doesn't include his radio shows, which began in 1948 as the
nightly ``Vaudeville Isn't Dead.'' His weekly all-night radio show
``Joe Franklin's Memory Lane'' still airs on WOR.
   ``People think I'm older,'' said Franklin, 61. ``When I was 25,
people thought I was 50 because I was doing nostalgia. I meet
people 90 years old tell me that they were fans of mine when they
were a kid.''
   He surveys his packed room. ``This is a hundredth of what I
own,'' he said, estimating his collection at 50,000 discs, 10,000
classic and silent films, and enough unclassifiable memorabilia to
verge on character disorder.
   Earlier in the day, he had appeared on the ``Live with Regis and
Kathy Lee'' show with a shopping bag full of his treasured
mementos:
   A tumbler he calls W.C. Fields' shot glass. A shoe of Greta
Garbo's. A small pillow that Eddie Cantor used. A lock of Elvis
Presley's fine black hair, taped to a photograph of the King
getting a haircut.
   Some of Elvis' hair has fallen into Garbo's shoe. A weird
juxtaposition. He very carefully retrieves it and tucks it away.
   The two phones ring constantly. He takes calls in a chair beside
a ceiling-high stack of bound volumes of the New York Times from
the'20s and '30s. A constant stream of visitors vies for his
attention. He speaks to everyone.
   There's no secretary. His retinue is a group of older men, spry
pensioners or fellows between jobs, who answer the phone and run
for coffee. They greet visitors, introduce those awaiting an
audience and dote on their benefactor.
   In his heart, Franklin said, the year is 1934. Rudy Vallee sings
``Brother, Can You Spare a Dime,'' and Bob Hope is on Broadway
introducing ``I Can't Get Started With You'' and ``Smoke Gets in
Your Eyes.''
   ``I was 5 years old, you know. I would have loved to have been
older in 1934.'' In the 1934 he has invented, Joe Franklin knows
where he is.
   ``I'm going to vaudeville showe at the Palace theater to see
Eddie Cantor and Ruth Edding and Jack Benny and Ed Wynn and Al
Jolson and Georgie Jessel,'' he said. ``Every night.
   ``For me, the world ended about 1934.''

   Elsewhere in television ...
   NO HYPE: THE GODFATHER ON HBO: ``The Godfather Family: A Look
Inside'' is reprised Sunday on HBO. It's a must-see for fans of the
Godfather movies and of director Francis Ford Coppola.
   It has some tantalizing and beautiful scenes from ``The
Godfather Part III,'' but even without them, the excellent
interviews with Coppola, Al Pacino, Talia Shire and James Caan
would make the hour documentary worthwhile.
   As a bonus, you also get to see Martin Sheen's screen test for
the role of Michael Corleone (?) and Robert De Niro's test for the
role of Sonny. Of such things are silver screen trivia made.
   HBO is presenting ``The Godfather'' on Dec. 18 and 21, and ``The
Godfather Part II'' on Dec. 19 and 22. ``The Godfather Part III''
is scheduled for theatrical release Dec. 25.

<HEAD>New Author Ends 74-Year-Old Cliffhanger</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's most revered author died in 1916, leaving
his final novel incomplete and his readers wondering whether the
main character, Tsuda, would win Kiyoko's heart.
   A writer who spent part of her childhood in the United States
finally resolved the cliffhanger this year with a continuation of
Natsume Soseki's classic novel ``Meian.''
   For 74 years, no Japanese author had dared resolve the puzzle
left by Soseki, a towering intellect. His face adorns the 1,000-yen
bill and his brain is preserved at Tokyo University.
   Minae Mizumura's audacity and her success in mastering the
idiosyncratic Japanese of the nation's greatest literary figure
have made her a sensation in Japan's staid literary establishment.
   ``Soseki is so deified that no one can possibly live up to his
reputation,'' Mizumura, a petite woman in her mid-30s, said with a
self-effacing laugh. ``It's natural that people would react against
the book, so no one wrote it.''
   Her 373-page first novel ``Meian Continued'' has sold 26,500
copies since its release in August, good for serious literature but
small-time compared with hits that sell more than a million.
   ``I figured many people, like me, would like to know how the
story ends, and since Soseki is so famous, I figured that at least
libraries and Soseki scholars would buy the book,'' said Mizumura,
a former lecturer in Japanese literature at Princeton University.
   Soseki's novel is about newlyweds who find, after playing the
doting husband and wife for about six months, that they aren't
happy together.
   Tsuda, a white-collar worker from a rich family, has to
acknowledge he doesn't really love his wife, whom he met shortly
after being jilted by Kiyoko, the woman he does love.
   He tries to confront Kiyoko, who is married and appears only in
the last few pages of ``Meian,'' to learn why she rejected him. The
book ends just as his courage fails.
   ``Meian'' was written in Soseki's gloomy later years and is not
among his best-loved novels. Many Japanese read the book in school,
however, in addition to his more humorous earlier works.
   Even the highly educated consider Soseki's Japanese antiquated
and difficult. It relies heavily on unique uses of the Chinese
characters and sets of syllables that form Japan's written
language.
   ``Young people in Japan don't read books written in prewar
Japanese,'' Mizumura said. ``It's even rather difficult for college
students.''
   She described her foray into serious literature as a
contribution to reviving long-discarded forms of more traditional
Japanese.
   ``Soseki was one of the last Japanese novelists to use Chinese
characters to their full advantage to bring a text to life,'' she
said in an interview. ``His use of the language is fascinating, and
it's so much richer than that used today.''
   Most critics applauded her for mastering Soseki's difficult
style.
   Ken Yasuhara wrote in the monthly literary magazine Gendaishi
Techo that Mizumura's continuation ``is more moving than Soseki's
original,''
   She left Japan at age 12 when her father's company transferred
him to the United States. Her higher education was in English and
French, but she eventually drifted toward her real love, Japanese
literature.
   She was a doctoral student at Yale University and spent three
years teaching at Princeton. In January, she will begin teaching at
the University of Michigan.
   Mizumura said her status as an outsider gave her the courage to
approach the task other Japanese writers avoided.
   ``I had no literary reputation to risk, no set literary style,''
she said. ``I had no nothing to lose in giving it a try.''
   In ``Meian Continued,'' Tsuda is rebuffed after finally daring
to ask Kiyoko why she spurned him. ``While I don't dislike you,''
she says, ``you're the sort of person I can't stand.''
   Tsuda's wife, Onobu, realizes her efforts to win his love aren't
working, and considers suicide.
   Having resolved one enigma, Mizumura leaves her readers with
another: will Onobu choose life or death?

<HEAD>Wright Has Faith in America But Not in Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singling out the Federal Reserve in particular,
investment adviser John Winthrop Wright declared this week that
misconceived policies over the past two decades have foolishly and
needlessly weakened the U.S. economy.
   The accusation is not a new one for Wright, who believes
America's economy would function with profit for all and with
little inflation if growth were promoted rather than almost
constantly repressed.
   ``That's what it used to do,'' said Wright, who heads Wright
Investors' Service, an international research and advisory firm
that handles billions of dollars of investments for banks,
individuals and others.
   That view, of course, has put him into conflict with every
Federal Reserve chairman in the past two decades, all of whom have
viewed the economy as a potential monster to be restrained lest it
run wild and generate inflation.
   As he has every year during that 20-year span, Wright addressed
the New York Society of Security Analysts. He is the only
investment thinker who has been invited back so regularly.
   He lit into America's economic leadership, giving the assembled
analysts a message they won't soon forget.
   ``For two decades now, instead of gearing fiscal and monetary
policies to encourage production and investment, we've pushed
consumption and borrowing,'' he said. He said it's led to the
obvious: We tried to have more than we made.
   A great bear of a man with enormous faith in abilities of
ordinary people, now in his late 70s and as respected by some
economists as he is by investment analysts, Wright was just warming
to the thrust of his critique.
   ``Instead of preserving and increasing our capital strength,''
he said, ``we have dissipated it and destroyed the national savings
and loan system.
   ``Instead of decreasing costs by encouraging wider competition,
we have ignored our antitrust legislation and fostered monopolistic
practices.
   ``And instead of enlarging the public ownership of American
industry, we have concentrated it in the hands of powerful
supranational organizations and foreign investors.''
   While pursuing what he suggested was an almost mindless course,
``U.S. policy makers have eschewed legitimate economic growth while
tilting at inflationary windmills.''
   The result, Wright said, is that the widely acclaimed expansion
of the 1980s was, in some ways a time of terrible waste and
developing weakness. ``The 1980s saw the slowest rate of U.S.
economic growth since the 1930s,'' he said.
   Many people might find that hard to believe, since certain
economic data can be gathered to rebut it. But, as with so much in
economics, a lot depends on the statistics you choose. Wright
measured by the American worker.
   The real growth rate in gross national product per worker was
0.8 percent a year during the 1980s, he said, which was less than
half the average of 1.7 percent a year for the four decades since
1950.
   ``Perhaps the most discouraging statistic that I have come
across in years,'' he told the analysts, ``is the fact that real
earnings of workers in the non-farm economy have declined for most
of the past 20 years.''
   He did not spare the investment community. ``There were those
among us who led ivestors on a wild takeover chase during the
'80s,'' he said, while ignoring solid, high-quality opportunities
in productive enterprises.
   All those excesses of the 1980s, he contends, were made possible
by or encouraged by improper economic policies.
   Is there a future? A good one, he said, if Americans can learn
that they have a wonderful, productive, job-producing,
life-enhancing piece of machinery that they must run properly for
all participants.
   ``American workers can still be the most productive in the
world, if only they are provided with the proper tools and adequate
training,'' he said. And U.S. companies can compete anywhere with
anyone if they have access to capital at rates low enough to
encourage productive investments.
   He insisted that investment markets must be delivered from the
hands of concentrated powers and returned to broad public
ownership, ``which prevailed before the takeovers and share-buyback
programs.''
   And he reiterated his faith that ``the American people can and
will kick their addiction to foreign capital, but only if the
nation's policymakers provide adequate incentives for savings and
investment.''

   While the rest of America is plunking down in
front of TV sets to watch parades and football games on New Year's
Day, Alice Tauber expects to be, well ... counting bottles.
   ``I'm freaking out,'' she says. She smiles as she says this, but
there's a hint of panic as her eyes dart over thousands of bottles
in the liquor store she and her husband Ed have owned for 16 years.
   You see, all those bottles have to be counted so the Tauberscan
figure how much of the new federal excise tax they'll have to pay.
   They won't be alone. Everyone who sells alcohol and cigarettes -
some 600,000 retail outlets plus producers, importers and
wholesalers - must count every bottle and every pack as of Jan. 1,
the day the tax goes into effect.
   This is a one-time inventory. Normally, producers and importers
pay all excise taxes and in fact, they paid the taxes on everything
now on the shelves. But those were the old, lower rates. So
retailers must make up the difference between the old tax and the
new tax on items still unsold.
   Once they complete the count and pay the appropriate tax,
retailers like the Taubers won't have to worry about it again.
Importers and producers will resume paying all the taxes at the new
rate, generally passing along the cost in higher wholesale prices.
   The Taubers' extensive Continental Liquors store in downtown
Washington always closes New Year's Day. This year, the Taubers,
their 10 employees, their 22-year-old daughter and 21-year-old son
will all be working, probably for 11 straight hours.
   ``They're dead if they don't show up,'' Mrs. Tauber said.
   Completing the inventory forms and determining the tax owed is
not a job for the math-phobic.
   Although almost all liquor is bottled in metric measures.
Congress taxes by the gallon, the way producers measure their
output. In addition, the tax on distilled spirits - such as vodka
and bourbon - is based on so-called proof gallons, meaning gallons
that are 100 proof, or 50 percent alcohol.
   So it's not enough for the Taubers simply to count all the
bottles of vodka. There will be different taxes for a 750
milliliter bottle of 80-proof vodka, a 750 milliliter bottle of
100-proof vodka and a liter bottle of either strength.
   An information packet provided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, which collects the tax, contains three lengthy pages
of sample computations plus a page of mind-bending conversion
charts that require multiplication by such numbers as 0.22915.
   All this work should yield $300 million for government coffers
by the end of June, when the tax is due, said ATF spokesman Jack
Killorin. But it will be a ``challenge,'' Killorin said, for both
the retailers and the ATF, which must check the accuracy of the
inventories and taxes paid.
   John B. Burcham Jr., executive director of the 10,000-member
National Liquor Stores Association, said the inventory comes at a
bad time.
   ``Retailers are ending up the very busiest months ... when it's
make or break for the whole year,'' Burcham said. The tax ``imposes
a tremendous workload on retailers for which they get no return,''
he said.
   There are some exceptions: Stores with small stocks, less than
500 gallons, must take inventory but won't have to make up the tax
gap.
   And the inventory will be easier for fully computerized stores.
The Taubers' store is not.
   Ed Tauber couldn't even estimate how many types of distilled
spirits, wine and beer the store carried, much less how many
bottles were on hand.
   ``Thousands, just thousands,'' he said.
   A count of the vodkas revealed just how massive the job is, and
the store has far more wine than distilled liquor.
   There are 51 different vodkas, including 750 milliliter and 1
liter bottles of the same vodkas. There are eight different choices
of Stolichnaya alone, from the usual 80-proof and 100-proof bottles
in two sizes each to the 90-proof Okhotnichya, flavored with
mountain grass and heather honey.
   Once the bottles are counted, Ed has to figure the appropriate
new price for every single type of liquor, wine and beer in the
store.
   The tax increases already are set: $1 per proof gallon of
distilled spirits; 90 cents per gallon of wine, excluding sparkling
wine; $9 per barrel of beer, with 31 gallons per barrel; $2 per
1,000 cigarettes; and $1 per gallon of imported perfume.
   But Tauber says he can't simply impose a 25-cent price hike on
each bottle. Some producers or wholesalers may decide to eat the
tax hike to keep their product selling.
   When the companies don't tell him their new pricing plans,
Tauber will have to guess.
   Then there are the price tags.
   ``Every shelf tag will have to change,'' he said. ``We'll have
to slap another tag on each bottle.''
   Businesses have until Jan. 10 to count bottles as long as they
keep records enabling them to pinpoint what they had in stock New
Year's Day.
   The Taubers hope to simplify matters by doing as much as
possible that day.
   And come Jan. 2, Mrs. Tauber said with a laugh, ``Either I'll be
in the hospital or I'll be drunk.''

<TEXT>
   Bournet Huddleston says the
Persian Gulf confrontation is about freedom, although Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia aren't democracies.
   Walter Boomer, Jackie Jones and others hope to right a wrong.
Scott Swindle and Julie Taylor figure it's about oil.
   Jerome McReynolds just wonders why.
   A clear mission is essential to the success of any military
operation, but opinions about why they may be asked to fight vary
widely among the thousands of GIs in Saudi Arabia.
   President Bush has been at pains to explain the mission, both to
keep American troops informed and to hold together the polygot
international coalition that has opposed Iraq since it invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Operation Desert Shield began at King Fahd's request, to defend
Saudi Arabia.
   Bush drew his ``line in the sand'' to protect the kingdom and
the American interest in stable oil supplies, to liberate Kuwait
and restore its emir, check Saddam Hussein and free U.S. hostages
held by Iraq.
   Since then, there has been talk of destroying Saddam's military
machine and his capacity for developing nuclear weapons, forcing
him from power and creating a new order in the Middle East.
   In November, the United Nations gave Saddam until Jan. 15 to
leave Kuwait or face military action. By that time, the United
States will have about 430,000 soldiers in the Persian Gulf.
   Congressional opposition to the use of force has increased, and
Bush said last month of the confusion over Desert Shield's purpose:
``If I haven't done as clear a job as I might have on explaining
this, then I've got to do better, because I know in my heart of
hearts that what we're doing is right.''
   If force proves necessary, Bush has pledged, it will be an
all-out strike rather than the muddled, incremental response of
America's intervention in Vietnam two decades ago.
   ``This will not be another Vietnam,'' he declared. ``This will
not be a protracted, drawn-out war.''
   Perhaps for most of the troops dug into the Saudi sand, the word
from the commander in chief is enough.
   ``I came over here because someone in authority told me to,''
said Lance Cpl. Will French, 24, of Johnstown, Pa., who serves with
the 1st Marine Tank Battalion. ``I've got my questions, but I'm not
at liberty to say what they are.''
   Bournet ``Hollywood'' Huddleston, a Marine lance corporal from
Los Angeles, said: ``We're all here to kick some ass. Let's free
these people so we can go home and be free again.''
   Generally, the GIs feel their reason for being in Saudi Arabia
is to defend this Islamic kingdom, which has the world's largest
oil reserves, about 255 billion barrels.
   More than a few believe the whole gulf confrontation is about
the price of gasoline and ensuring supplies of cheap oil for
Americans.
   ``Thousands of people are going to die if we go to war or if we
get gassed,'' said Airman Julie Taylor, 20, of Lake Tahoe, Calif.
``I don't think a quart of Valvoline is a good reason for it.''
   Pfc. Scott Swindle, 20, of Albany, Ore., said: ``I don't think
it's worth all our lives for oil and gas, but it's my job, so I'll
do it.'' Swindle is with the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment.
   Others feel the mission is to check Saddam's aggression and deny
him nuclear and chemical weapons that threaten peace.
   ``We're here for more than just the price of a gallon of gas,''
said Master Sgt. J.R. Kendall of the 82nd Airborne Division. ``What
we're doing is going to chart the future of the world for the next
100 years. It's better to deal with this guy now than five years
from now. One way or another, he's got to be dealt with.''
   Jackie Jones, a 25-year-old Army lieutenant from Springfield,
Va., said the purpose is ``to show the rest of the world the United
States is not going to stand for bullies trying to wipe other
countries off the face of the earth. If we let him get away with
this, who knows what's going to be next?''
   She serves with a Patriot missile battery of the 18th Airborne
Corps.
   For some, it's a simple matter of right and wrong, a feeling
that runs from the top brass down throuh the ranks.
   ``There are things worth fighting for,'' said Lt. Gen. Walter
Boomer, 52, who commands the U.S. Marines in Saudi Arabia. ``A
world in which brutality and lawlessness are allowed to go
unchecked isn't the kind of world we're going to want to live in.''
   ``Someone's got to pay the price for freedom over here,'' said
Lance Cpl. Anthony Uhler, 20, of Pontiac, Mich., who serves with a
Marine Light Armored Infantry company.
   The reasons for fighting seem clearest among combat units
closest to the Kuwaiti border. Doubts are found more readily among
those pulled from base offices to live in tents or the reservists
and National Guard members plucked from civilian life.
   ``I actually don't know why we're here,'' said Staff Sgt. Jerome
McReynolds, 39, of Montgomery, Ala., a National Guardsman with the
1241st Postal Unit.
   ``The mission? I'd really like to know. What is it?''

   The mail's still slow, the
pre-packaged food is monotonous and there are few places to unwind.
The flies and scorpions have not retreated before the biggest
American force sent overseas in 20 years.
   But Staff Sgt. Joe Estes, a 25-year Army veteran, said morale
after four months in the desrt is ``100 percent better'' than in
the dark years of Vietnam.
   There's plenty of griping and a universal desire to go home,
especially as Christmas approaches, but there are few serious
symptoms of a demoralized fighting force.
   The ``booze, broads and drugs'' synonymous with Vietnam are
forbidden in this conservative Moslem kingdom.
   Since American soldiers arrived to confront Saddam Hussein and
his occupation of Kuwait, only a handful have been caught drinking.
There have been no reports of drug use or illegal fraternization
with Saudi women.
   Fragging, the GI tactic in Vietnam of getting rid of unpopular
officers with a grenade or bullet, is not even mentioned.
   The draftees of Vietnam and their hatred for the military
establishment are long gone. In 1990, the U.S. military is a
totally volunteer force.
   Many soldiers in Operation Desert Shield admit they never
expected to fight a war, but they are prepared to do their job,
whether it is flying an F-15 fighter, firing a howitzer or washing
uniforms.
   ``You've got a more educated, a more physically fit type of Army
you're working with now,'' said Estes, a wiry 42-year-old
infantryman from Nashville, Tenn., who was in Vietnam near the
height of U.S. involvement in 1967-68.
   ``Morale's at an all-time high. Confidence is real high,'' he
said, watching top-of-the-line M1A1 tanks rumble off the cargo ship
Cape Inspiration.
   Brig. Gen. Steven L. Arnold, assistant chief of staff in the
Army Forces Central Command, served two tours in Vietnam. He said
the rmy had recovered from that traumatizing conflict and
subsequent antagonism to the military.
   ``This is as good a peacetime army as I think has ever
existed,'' he said. ``I know people are saying (the troops) are
complaining. ... Soldiers are always complaining about things, but
that's not an indication of morale.''
   As Marine Cpl. Ed Walsh of Las Vegas, Nev., put it: ``If a
Marine ain't griping, he ain't happy.'' Walsh, 21, is with the 1st
Marine Expeditionary Force.
   Arnold said the key to morale is whether ``soldiers willingly do
the right thing without being told and ... do it well. That's
discipline, and a disciplined force is really a high-morale force.
   ``When you have forces that are challenged, and you're giving
them the type of training that meets their expectations, I think
you see a lot of high morale. You see it here.''
   One yardstick for morale is mental health.
   ``We've had very little business,'' said Capt. Frank Mullins,
54, of Mobile, Ala., a psychologist with the Mental Health Unit at
the U.S. Navy's Fleet No. 5 Hospital. ``Morale has been excellent
from what we've seen. People can complain a lot, bitch and carry
on, but morale can be very high.''
   Desert Shield is the biggest U.S. military operation since
Vietnam, where U.S. strength reached 545,000 at its peak. More than
240,000 American personnel now are in the gulf and 200,000 more
will be in place by mid-January.
   Complaints in a force of that size are inevitable. Two of the
biggest problems are monotony and few escapes.
   ``This is a prison; you can't go anywhere,'' moaned Lance Cpl.
Steven Jenkins, 24, of Neptune, N.J., a maintenance man with a
Marine air wing.
   Army Sgt. Kenneth Hetzer, 32, had other complaints after nearly
three months in a forward position with the 75th Field Artillery
Brigade: Soldiers had holes in their boots, weren't allowed to use
the telephone and had to pay $3 for a block of ice.
   Walsh said that, despite the griping, ``we're really locked on.
If war comes, it'd be like uncoiling a snake. ... There's nothing
that can stop us.''
   Attitudes differ in front and rear units, and between full-time
soldiers and the reserve and National Guard units mobilized at
short notice.
   ``Morale was very high and it got higher as we got closer to the
Kuwaiti border,'' said Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino, a California
Republican who visited the troops last month with a 20-member
congressional delegation.
   ``The more primitive the conditions, the higher the morale,'' he
said. ``The people in the more primitive conditions are the combat
infantry, the combat Marine forces that were trained in the desert,
so they know what they're doing.''
   Army Sgt. 1st Class Thomas Melton, 39, of Florence, Ala., said:
``The guys up there know they've got a mission. Down here, it's
just sit and wait for your equipment to come in and get to your
location. It's very boring to sit around waiting. That's the big
problem.''
   Melton has traveled extensively in Saudi Arabia as part of the
207th Military Intelligence Brigade.
   In the words of Marine Cpl. Carlin Walters, 21, of Vidor, Texas:
``The boredom gets pretty strenuous. It'd be better just to go
ahead and get it over with.''
   The Marines, all in forward positions near the Kuwaiti border,
and Army combat units like the 82nd Airborne Division have
reputations for high morale in bad conditions.
   At the other extreme are rear units with serious problems, like
the 1241st Postal Unit from the Alabama Army National Guard.
   ``We've got a lot of soldiers ready to go home,'' said Sgt.
Michael Smith, 32, of Montgomery. ``The morale around here's at the
very bottom. If things were different and we were civiians, we'd
probably strike.''
   For most soldiers, the toughest thing is not knowing when they
will go home.
   ``Either an operation or a go-home date is going to boost
morale,'' said 1st Lt. Bruce Lake, 29, of Newport News, Va., a
platoon leader with the 24th Infantry Division.
   With the usual GI diversions banned, the military has tried to
keep morale up with sports, movies and music.
   Mail is the biggest booster.
   ``Mail equals morale,'' Lake said.
   Veterans like Sgt. Estes, who never heard a word of support from
the American public while fighting in Vietnam, are overwhelmed by
the flood of letters his countrymen send to ``any serviceman'' in
Saudi Arabia.
   Many GIs have found new pen pals, including churches, clubs and
schools.
   ``This place here is just what you make it,'' said Staff Sgt.
Jeanne Kendall, 35, of Piedmont, Ohio, an Air Force mechanic.
   ``We've made it one big party. Bring a guitar and have a
singalong.''

<TEXT>
   Alberto Fujimori was a political outsider, a
man unknown to most Peruvian voters until he surged in popularity
and won the presidency.
   Many feared the son of poor Japanese immigrants was unprepared
to govern a nation bordering on anarchy. It was said often that the
military would throw him out within months.
   Since taking office July 28, however, the 52-year-old
agricultural engineer has moved quickly to impose his authority.
   Without an organized party or legislative majority, he has
forged a close alliance with the army and begun to govern by
decree, challenging Peru's traditional power brokers.
   President Fujimori has described corrupt judges as ``jackals,''
condemned congressmen as useless and attacked ``medieval'' Roman
Catholic bishops who opposed his birth control program. He also has
heaped scorn on ``idle bureaucrats who spend their days reading
papers or doing crossword puzzles.''
   In a recent speech, Fujimori said his election resulted from the
same desperation that spawned the fanatical Shining Path
guerrillas. His supporters, he said, voted with ``enormous and
burning anger.''
   ``My government is the product of rejection, of being fed up
with Peru because of the frivolity, corruption and non-functioning
of the traditional political class and the bureaucracy,'' Fujimori
declared.
   In his first official act hours after taking office, he fired
the air force and navy commanders. The air force chief had been
accused of corruption and the navy was suspected of plotting a
coup.
   He put the army in charge of two ministries, including the
Interior Ministry, which controls the police.
   Early in August, he imposed drastic austerity measures to stop
hyperinflation. He sent soldiers into the streets to stop violent
protests before they spread out of control.
   In a meeting with foreign correspondents, Fujimori said of his
critics: ``What do they expect of Peru, that the disorder, the
chaos, the social indiscipline continue? Or do they want a
government that really governs, that defends order?''
   Newspapers have called him ``emperor'' for his authoritarian
style. Fujimori says the criticism will not change him.
   ``Peru is in a chaotic, truly critical situation,'' he told the
foreign reporters. ``We must make deep structural changes, and
that's what we're doing.''
   His attacks have struck a chord with a society tired of the
failure of its political institutions. Polls indicate six of 10
Peruvians support him despite the austerity measures, the severest
in Peru's history.
   One of his first targets was a court system infamous for
corruption. Fujimori calls the Palace of Justice ``the Palace of
Injustice.''
   He has begun releasing hundreds of prisoners who spent years
awaiting trial in fetid jails. Judges say he is violating the
constitutional separation of powers.
   The president also has begun challenging the power of Peru's
communist-led labor federations.
   In November, he declared strikes by public employees illegal and
signed a decree allowing the government to fire those who did not
return to work. The threat broke a strike that had closed hospitals
run by the Social Security Institute.
   Public employees have paralyzed vital services for years with
strikes that won generous raises. Fearing the power of the unions,
previous presidents and lawmakers ignored demands for legislation
limiting the right to strike.
   ``If Fujimori wins this struggle, the benefits for Peru will be
innumerable and will flood in,'' wrote Manuel d'Ornellas, editor of
the newspaper Expreso.
   Fujimori's austerity program appears to be winning the battle
against inflation, which was 3,000 percent a year when he took
office. The measures eliminated subsidies and price controls, which
were causing a huge budget deficit.
   Food prices shot up fivefold initially and the price of gasoline
increased by 30 times, but monthly inflation has fallen since
August from 400 percent to less than 10.
   During his presidential campaign against novelist Mario Vargas
Llosa, Fujimori pledged not to impose an ``economic shock''
program. Analysts say fear that Peruvians might riot against harsh
austerity measures may have led him to ally himself with the army.
   ``In Peru, great force is needed to govern,'' political analyst
Fernando Rospigliosi said in an interview. ``If you are going to
administer an economic shock, you have to put tanks into the
streets.''
   Javier Valle Riestra, a senator for the populist Aprista party
of former President Alan Garcia, said: ``Alberto Fujimori's sense
of realism has drawn him to the true center of power in Peru, the
army.''
   Fujimori's political skills have surprised opponents, who regard
him as secretive and unpredictable. Even his closest advisers often
seem surprised by his announcements.
   Much of his power so far has rested on an ability to foment
division among his opponents, Rospigliosi noted. Fujimori honed his
negotiating and manipulative skills during years as rector of the
National Agrarian University, a highly politicized environment like
other Peruvian universities.
   Analysts say, however, that Fujimori's power base is shaky.
   ``He's playing a very dangerous game,'' Rospigliosi said. ``He's
leaning on the military for support. Fujimori does not control the
military. They're doing what he wants for the moment, but tomorrow
he could become their prisoner.''

<TEXT>
   Rep. William D. Ford was a 20-year-old
freshman at Nebraska Teachers College when his father died while
working at a Michigan automobile plant.
   It was a heart attack, the company insisted.
   But the suspicious son crept into the plant, interviewed
employees and finally learned the truth: Upholstery had caught fire
and his father was overcome by toxic smoke as he battled the
flames.
   That tragedy 43 years ago helped mold the Michigan Democrat into
the passionate advocate of organized labor and workplace safety who
next month becomes chairman of the House Education and Labor
Committee, succeeding the retiring Rep. Gus Hawkins, D-Calif.
   Ford will relinquish the chairmanship of the Post Office and
Civil Service Committee, which he has held since 1981.
   He has been a member of Education and Labor throughout his 26
years in Congress, helping craft legislation such as the
Occupational Safety and Health Act.
   He says many small, non-union workplaces remain dangerous
despite improvements at large companies.
   ``The cynical answer is that you can't have strict enforcement
(of safety regulations) and jobs, jobs, jobs,'' he said. ``But I
think you can.''
   Ford refused in a recent interview to discuss his legislative
agenda in detail, saying he wanted to talk with committee members
first. But he's likely to reintroduce a bill that stalled this year
to protect whistleblowers who expose workplace dangers.
   He hopes for more money for education and job training, but
acknowledges his committee will have to focus on making better use
of existing funds.
   ``There are ways to improve the quality of life without spending
a lot of money,'' he said. ``We've got to figure out how.''
   Ford may seek changes in the federal student aid program,
plagued by reports of fraud, as his committee undertakes
reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. He says there should
be fewer loans and more grants for poor and middle-class college
students.
   Blunt and aggressive, with a staunchly liberal philosophy rooted
in the New Deal, Ford is popular with labor unions and education
activists who hope he can provide impetus for initiatives that fell
by the wayside in the conservative 1980s.
   ``He's one of our strongest allies in the House, no doubt about
it,'' said Keith Geiger, president of the National Education
Association.
   ``On family and medical leave, civil rights, plant closings .. .
Bill Ford has always been there for the average working man and
woman,'' said Bob McGlotten, legislative director for the AFL-CIO.
   Ford is determined to restore the prominence the Education and
Labor Committee lost in the 1980s, when its left-leaning Democratic
majority seemed out of step with the conservative times.
   ``They've been by and large a backwater in the Congress as the
focus shifted to the budget process,'' said Norman Ornstein,
resident scholar with the American Enterprise Institute.
``Especially in the Reagan years, they simply haven't been as major
a factor.''
   Ford believes Americans are weary of overseas entanglements and
billion-dollar weapons systems. They may not yearn for a 1990s
version of Lyndon B. Johnson's ``Great Society,'' he says, but
there is a growing commitment to improving schools and fighting
poverty.
   ``I'd like to believe we can convince people that this
me-and-me-only crap is over and we've got to make investments in
the future generations,'' he said.
   Responding to a lobbyist's plea earlier this year to support the
B-2 stealth bomber, Ford offered a tongue-in-cheek proposition: He
would vote for the $800 million aircraft if President Bush would
request a tax increase to pay for it.
   ``I am not going to put one more of these toys on a credit card
that my grandkids are going to have to pay off,'' Ford snapped.
   Ford, 63, the son of immigrants, was raised in blue-collar
Detroit neighborhoods. He served in the Navy and was a city
attorney and justice of the peace. In the latter job he crossed
paths with a young prosecutor named John Dingell, now chairman of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee and a frequent hunting and
fishing partner of Ford's.
   After serving two years in the Michigan Senate, Ford was elected
to Congress in 1964. He's since faced no serious challenge in his
suburban Detroit district, winning his 14th term last month with 63
percent of the vote.
   A fater of three who was married for the third time this year,
Ford is known for legislative craftiness and fierce partisanship
that sometimes prompts complaints from Republicans on his
committees.
   His tenacity was evident in his 14-year struggle for legislation
to require advance notice of plant closings, rewarded in 1988 when
Congress overrode President Reagan's veto of a closure bill.
   Ford isn't related to the founder of the automobile company of
the same name. But his loyalty to the industry that employs
thousands of his constituents was evident this month.
   He decreed that the 50 Capitol Hill parking spaces reserved for
Education and Labor staffers were off-limits to foreign cars.

   In the distant, snowy Hindu Kush of
Afghanistan, the mountain stillness is broken by the rockets, bombs
and bullets of a leftover war against a faded ideology.
   ``We will fight until communism is gone from our country,'' said
Gulzaman Tahidyar, a 21-year-old guerrilla. ``We will bring Islam
to Afghanistan.''
   ``We will live in the desert, we will live in the mountains, but
we will never accept communism,'' said Tahidyar, the anti-communist
slogans of the early 1980s tumbling out.
   The young warrior prepared to return to the mountains, as he has
for eight years, but time has passed him by. The enemy he fought so
hard for so long isn't really there anymore.
   Soviet troop convoys that rumbled through his homeland for
nearly a decade have been gone for two years. In Kabul, the
government has abandoned the Marxist ideology it once tried to
impose on a rural, Moslem people and seeks to cloak itself in
Islam.
   Like most mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, Tahidyar talks
more and more of fighting ``with the last drop of our blood,'' less
and less of victory or what it might mean. The war, now in its 12th
year, is no longer a clear ideological struggle.
   When the last of the 115,000 Soviet army troops left Afghanistan
on Feb. 15, 1989, the Moslem guerrillas and their Western backers
confidently measured the Kabul government's survival in weeks and
months.
   Few thought the mujahedeen would even have to fight. President
Najibullah's government, they were convinced, would collapse from
within and the guerrillas would march triumphantly into Kabul.
   They were wrong.
   Twenty-two months later, the optimism is gone. Disappointment
and despair fill the dried-mud refugee camps around Peshawar, the
wild west border city that has been the staging area for men once
romanticized as valiant freedom fighters who challenged the mighty
Soviet army.
   In Afghanistan, little has changed since the Soviet withdrawal.
Soldiers loyal to Najibullah hold the cities and the mujahedeen
control much of the countryside.
   With the Soviets gone, the world has grown indifferent to a
country that seems, except for an array of modern weapons, still to
live in the 14th century.
   The United States and Soviet Union are trying to work out a
face-saving exit from the bloodiest conflict of the 1980s. It is
expected to include a cease-fire, transition government and
internationally supervised elections.
   On Dec. 11, they announced an agreement to stop supplying
weapons to the Afghan belligerents, but did not set a cutoff date.
   Both have recalcitrant clients, and no deal they make will
guarantee peace. History has shown the fiercely independent Afghans
do not accept political parties, a strong central government or the
tutelage of outsiders.
   ``No one, not even the superpowers, can impose their will on the
people of Afghanistan; this we can prove,'' said Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, considered the most ruthless, ambitious and anti-West of
the seven guerrilla leaders.
   Hekmatyar is said to have a two-year stockpile of arms paid for
by Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Libya, and cam try to spoil any
settlement he doesn't like.
   The most pressing problem for all parties is to find someone who
can replace Najibullah and pull the warring factions together.
   Najibullah, former chief of the secret police, has proved a more
clever, formidable politician than most people thought, including
his Soviet sponsors. The Americans acknowledge the mujahedeen have
no one to match him.
   Washington has dropped its demand that Najibullah resign before
elections, but insists he transfer authority over the military,
secret police and official media to an interim coalition of all
parties.
   He has offered to give up control of security forces and some
other powers if the major guerrilla groups enter negotiations. They
have rejected the proposal.
   Moscow still believes Najibullah is the only person who can
control the more hard-line elements of his Hezb-e-Watan, or Party
of the Homeland, which was the People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan until early this year.
   Najibullah has traded in loyalties, risen with his rivals'
failures and used money and power to buy time for himself and his
government. He has brought peace of sorts to parts of the country
by making live-and-let-live deals with local mujahedeen commanders.
   Unlike the guerrillas, Najibullah at least pays lip service to
the people's yearning for peace, appealing for an end to the war
and for the return of nearly 6 million refugees from neighboring
Pakistan and Iran.
   He has admitted the mistakes of the April 1978 revolution that
brought communists to power and tried to convince the world his
government had changed, but many Afghans still blame him for much
of the bloodshed. The war has claimed more than 1{ million lives.
   ``We will fight Najibullah and communism while we live; if we
die, our children will fight,'' said Wali Mohammed, 70. ``If our
children die, our ladies will fight. There are many children who
have never seen their country, but they will grow up to fight
Najibullah, God willing.''
   Most Afghans may not accept Najibullah, but many also reject
Hekmatyar and the other six resistance leaders, who have made huge
fortunes off the war. Personal ambition and murderous infighting
doomed a government in exile the leaders touted as the alternative
to Najibullah.
   With time and American money running out, mujahedeen field
commanders have ignored their leaders, set aside personal and
ethnic differences and are coordinating attacks in what could be
their last chance to win. Most observers say it's a good idea that
may have come two years late.
   The biggest and most immediate threat to Najibullah may not be
the mujahedeen.
   His economically strapped country still is heavily dependent on
the Soviet Union, especially for fuel to keep resupply convoys
moving and the air force flying.
   Sources say the Soviets, who have severe shortages and economic
troubles at home, have told Najibullah they cannot continue an aid
program estimated to cost $300 million a month.

   Here is a chronology of major events
in Afghanistan's 12-year-old civil war, which has cost more than
1.5 million lives and forced nearly 6 million people into exile:
   April 27, 1978 - Communists led by Nur Mohammad Taraki seized
power in a coup in which hundreds of people were killed. Within
weeks, the Soviet Union sent hundreds of military advisers to
Afghanistan.
   September 1979 - After months of factional disputes, Taraki's
main rival, Hafizullah Amin, killed him and took over as president.
Amin was despised by Moslems of the old order and a became a hated
symbol to the growing anti-communist resistance.
   Dec. 24, 1979 - The Soviets began a massive airlift of men and
armor to save the tottering Kabul regime. Three days later, 40,000
Soviet army troops were in control of Afghanistan, Amin was dead
and Moscow installed Babrak Karmal as president.
   May 1986 - Karmal resigned, ostensibily for health reasons, and
was replaced by Najibullah, chief of the secret police. Fighting
intensified toward year's end as guerrillas based in Pakistan
received U.S. Stinger and British Blowpipe anti-aircraft missiles.
   Jan. 15, 1987 - Najibullah announced a program of national
reconcilation, the first of several diplomatic proposals aimed at
drawing the insurgents into a power-sharing deal.
   April 15, 1988 - Afghanistan and Pakistan signed the Geneva
Accords, with the United States and Soviet Union as guarantors,
clearing the way for the Soviet army's departure. The guerrillas
refused to recognize the agreement.
   January 1989 - The United States and its Western allies closed
their embassies, citing security concerns.
   Feb. 15, 1989 - The last of 115,000 Soviet soldiers withdrew,
leavng Afghan troops to fight alone for the first time in more
than nine years.
   March 6, 1989 - Guerrillas switched from their usual hit-and-run
tactics to a conventional assault on the eastern city of Jalalabad.
It did not succeed.
   June 1989 - The United States and Pakistan called for a
political settlement, but insisted Najibullah step down first. He
and the Soviets rejected the demand.
   March 6, 1990 - Defense Minister Shah Nawaz Tanai led soldiers
in an uprising against Najibullah, joined by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a
fundamentalist guerrilla leader. Government forces crushed the
rebellion and Tanai fled to Pakistan.
   June 1990 - Najibullah called the first congress of his
communist political party in a quarter-century. The party
acknowledged mistakes, adopted sweeping reforms and changed its
name.
   October 1990 - As Washington and Moscow searched for a political
settlement, the U.S. Congress approved $250 million in aid for the
guerrillas. in Afghanistan, guerrilla field commanders set aside
their difference and began a coordinated winter offensive.

<HEAD>Soviet Supermarkets With Nothing to Sell</HEAD>

   MOSCOW (P) - In the meat department of the dingy Tagansky
supermarket, an opaque window slid open. Small packages of
pinkish-gray sausage tumbled through it into a refrigerated case
below.
   Scores of shoppers, in a line under flickering fluorescent
lights, snapped up the packages as they thudded into the case.
   The humiliating scene was duplicated at the other end of the
meat department. Plastic bags of frozen beef kidneys were hurled
from behind a sliding window to the 82 sullen shoppers waiting in
line.
   ``Like dogs!'' a woman muttered about the store's methods, which
are typical of state-run food stores in Moscow and elsewhere. Food
is more plentiful at farmers' markets in the cities, but prices are
much higher.
   Soviet officials say there is plenty of food but the centralized
distribution system is collapsing. They blame the collapse on
corruption and on farmers who hold back produce, waiting for a
market economy.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has solicited Western aid to see
his country through the winter.
   Shoppers found little but disappointment in the Tagansky
``gastronom,'' one of Moscow's biggest food stores, at midday on a
recent Saturday.
   Signs hanging from the ceiling read ``Macaroni Products,''
``Oatmeal,'' ``Flour,'' ``Cheese,'' ``Sausage,'' ``Chicken,''
``Canned Goods,'' ``Fish,'' ``Fruit'' and ``Milk.''
   Below them are two refrigerated cases, 58 feet long and empty.
   The bread department had a huge selection by Moscow supermarket
standards - five kinds of the Soviet staple. The Tagansky had no
macaroni, however, and more than 30 people were in line for
oatmeal.
   Milk, sometimes hard to find in Moscow, was in good supply
initially, but the hundreds of light blue one-liter cartons were
gone in an hour.
   Six old women surrounded a rack containing a dozen heads of
cabbage the size of bowling balls, some with large rotten spots.
The women turned the cabbages over and over, trying to decide
whether to buy.
   More than 250 people were jammed against each other behind a
barrier, waiting to buy wine.
   They pushed, jostled and muttered at one another. The supply ran
out while more than 200 were stil waiting. Some drifted away
reluctantly, but others stayed, hoping more wine would appear.
   An elderly woman wearing a green scarf confronted a sales clerk.
She accused the store of holding back supplies - and, by
implication, selling to black marketeers out the back door.
   ``We aren't hiding anything!'' the clerk retorted. ``We are sold
out! Do you take us for fools? Do you want us to be imprisoned?''
   ``I read in the newspaper that people are imprisoned for such
misbehavior!'' the woman said.
   The clerk turned to her co-workers and said, gesturing at the
complainer: ``She's got one foot in the grave and she's out walking
in search of wine!''
   ``You shouldn't work here!'' the old woman said. She turned to
leave, then hurled a final insult at the clerks:
   ``Speculators!''
   That was enough for her target. ``You have no right to call me
names!'' the clerk yelled. ``I'll call the police!''
   On her way to the door, the old women whimpered: ``I don't need
the police!''

<HEAD>What's a Paradigm? The Cause of a Lot of Republican Angst</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is an inside-the-beltway debate, conducted
in words most people don't use, with a predictable outcome but no
lack of noise. In Republican arguments about ``the new paradigm,''
the G is the only thing that's silent.
   Beneath those conservative buzzwords, Republicans in and out of
the administration have been arguing about proposals for President
Bush's Jan. 29 State of the Union message.
   ``There's a lot of phrases going around, phrases like
`empowerment' and `new paradigm,''' said John H. Sununu, the White
House chief of staff. ``The fact is that they all come down to that
fundamental approach of not having ... an overly centralized
process.''
   In other words, cutting through the bureaucracy to give
individuals and institutions more power to make their own
decisions, instead of relying on management by government. That's a
basic Republican theme, and a guaranteed feature of the 1991 Bush
program.
   The president says that centralized bureaucracy isn't working
for the people who need government help.
   Sununu said Bush would propose measures to allow individual
citizens, institutions, state and local governments ``to contribute
to the process again by unshackling them as much as possible...''
   A paradigm is an example or a pattern. Conservatives who favor
the new one want to remodel government using incentives and self
help. The goal is to give people the power to improve their own lot
by, for example, becoming tenant owners in what are now rented
public housing projects.
   Government-financed education vouchers would empower the poor to
send their children to private schools if they chose.
   There would be tax and other government incentives for
businesses that opened operations in depressed city areas,
designated as urban enterprise zones. Republicans, notably Jack
Kemp, the secretary of housing and urban development, have been
pushing that idea for years.
   Kemp has been chairman of an economic empowerment task force
putting together proposals for Bush.
   James P. Pinkerton, a White House policy aide, assembled ``the
new paradigm'' concept around proposals like those. The package may
be newer than most of its components.
   Nevertheless, it has been provoking arguments for a month, since
budget director Richard G. Darman sarcastically questioned whether
the ideas were new or workable.
   His boss seemed to think they were. ``What we're talking about
here in this conservative philosophy is unlimited opportunity - a
vision to protect the family, empower the poor and reward
creativity,'' Bush said in a speech to conservative leaders last
April 26. ``This new paradigm can fulfill it.''
   But Darman stirred up the argument with a Nov. 16 speech calling
the label a bit pretentious and questioning whether the ideas
behind it would work on the most difficult cases government
confronts.
   ``At the same time, in the real world, others might simply
dismiss it by picking up the refrain, `Hey, brother, can you
paradigm?'' he punned. That play on the words of the song
``Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?'' didn't go down well with
conservatives, who already were angry with Darman over the tax
increases the administration accepted in the budget deal he helped
negotiate.
   Darman also said that ``many of the ideas now returning as the
new paradigm - vouchers, decentralization, empowerment - were
themselves fashionable in the power-to-the-people '60s,'' as part
of the Democrats' war on poverty. Republicans advanced similar
proposals, reshaped into programs designed to shift power away from
Washington, to lower levels of government, closer to the people.
   Darman said such ideas never have been seriously tested or
evaluated, and should be. He put the emphasis on management, and
said programs should be judged, and financed, on the basis of
performance, not fads.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House GOP whip and a paradigm
man, called Darman's approach ``technocratic nihilism'' and likened
him to Michael Dukakis.
   He said Darman should either withdraw the speech or resign.
   Darman did neither, but they've since discussed their
disagreement to the point of at least temporary silence.
   Kemp argued the case for empowerment and federal tax cuts at a
conference of Republican governors, who were more concerned with
practical matters like state budget woes than with a debate about
philosophy and a cryptic slogan. The former pro football
quarterback ventures a paradigm pun of his own:
   ``I thought it had something to do with the nickel defense.''

<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Of all the dark days last winter, it is
Christmas that Judy Smith remembers best.
   Newly diagnosed with a mysterious and terrifying illness, and
wracked with pain, she lay on the couch in her living room in Santa
Fe.
   ``I cried for two hours,'' recalls Smith, 38. ``I've never been
so depressed and so ill and so frightened.''
   Nearly a year later, as she recounts her experience with
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, she wrings her hands or rubs her
aching arms.
   She tells of pain no specialist has been able to treat,
incessant fatigue, chest cramping and depression that led to
suicidal thoughts.
   But Smith calls herself lucky.
   Twenty-eight of at least 1,541 reported victims of the blood
disorder are dead. Others are unable to move their poisoned bodies
or leave their beds.
   Nearly all the known victims took L-tryptophan, an amino acid
sold as a dietary supplement until its recall. A popular treatment
for sleep disorders, stress and premenstrual syndrome, it was
widely available in pharmacies and health food stores.
   Health officials speculate that a contaminant in certain batches
of L-tryptophan produced by a Japanese manufacturer caused the EMS
epidemic. They also believe far more people in the United States
than have been reported - perhaps as many as 6,000 - are victims.
   More than a year after Smith became one of the nation's first
three diagnosed EMS cases, much about the disease remains a
mystery.
   Health officials don't yet understand why some people who took
L-tryptophan from bad batches got sick and others didn't. Nor do
they know why some got sicker than others, or why some have
recovered while others have worsened.
   ``We've got something brand-new that no one understands,'' says
Douglas Archer, deputy director of the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition at the federal Food and Drug Administration.
   The contaminant apparently was formed as the L-tryptophan was
being made by Showa Denko K.K., one of Japan's largest chemical
companies. It has been traced to lots manufactured from October
1988 to June 1989, and researchers are trying to determine whether
changes the company made in a purification process played a role.
   The disease is marked by an elevated count of one type of white
blood cell, the eosinophil. Symptoms include severe muscle pain,
joint pain and contracture, rashes, hair loss, skin changes, and
coughing.
   According to the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta,
a study of the earliest EMS victims indicate that one-third of them
have improved dramatically to almost completely. Another one-third
have experienced no change, and the remaining one-third show
increasing symptoms, said Rossanne Philen, an epidemiologist with
CDC.
   ``What it means is, if this is an accurate representation of the
population that is currently ill, we should expect for quite a few
people to be sick for quite a long time,'' Philen says.
   It has been 14 months since registered nurse Beth Bybee of
Williamsburg, Va., has been able to work. It's only within the past
two months she has been able to reach behind her back to fasten a
bra.
   Her left arm is contracted, her left thumb is numb, she tires
easily and her skin is lumpy, thick and tight.
   A 40-year-old former skier who did aerobic workouts several
times a week, Bybee fears she may never be able to resume those
activities.
   ``I think that's what for me has been the most ironic. The
majority of us were very health-conscious,'' she says. ``The three
patients I met while in (treatment) were my age, very
fitness-conscious, doing good things for their bodies - and
thinking L-tryptophan was an OK thing.''
   Bybee took L-tryptophan to help her sleep after it was
recommended by a friend.
   She ultimately found relief from the worst of her EMS symptoms
after a procedure in Houston in which doctors removed her blood,
separated the plasma from the blood cells, and returned the cells
to her body.
   Treatment, however, has been a hit-or-miss proposition.
   ``There's nothing that can consistently be said to be the
treatment for the disease at this point,'' says Phillip Hertzman, a
Los Alamos family practitioner who treated one of the first
victims.
   Some victims have improved after taking anti-inflammatory
corticosteroids.
   Judy Kody Paulsen, 39, of Albuquerque, credits her quick
treatment with prednisone, a cortisone derivative, for the extent
of her recovery.
   In the fall of 1989, Paulsen recalls that her skin and scalp
were so painful she couldn't wear sunglasses or towel-dry her hair.
Today Paulsen feels healthy, although she worries about unexplained
medical problems.
   ``Every time I wake up in the morning I say, `Is anything numb.
Is anything tingling. Is anything sore.' The first thought that
occurs to me is, `Oh, no. It's recurring.' That's very
disconcerting,'' she says.
   Smith, who recently moved to Dallas, says prednisone reduced her
eosinophil count but didn't help with the pain, for which she has
found no effective treatment.
   Richard Wurtman, a professor of neuroscience at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, describes L-tryptophan as
``an accident waiting to happen.''
   In 1971, Wurtman's research showed low doses of tryptophan could
increase the production of serotonin in the brain, making it useful
as a sleep aid and for other purposes.
   ``Calling it a nutritional supplement was a fraud from the
start,'' says Wurtman, director of MIT's Clinical Research Center.
``There's no nutritional basis for giving tryptophan by itself.''
   Marketing it as a nutritional supplement, however, precluded it
from FDA regulation under a 1976 law that exempts the makers of
vitamin and mineral supplements.
   The FDA had determined in the early 1970s that supplements made
of isolated amino acids could be dangerous, especially in large
doses, and should not be sold without a safety review. But the
agency never successfully enforced its regulation.
   Now the FDA plans to take another look at free amino acids used
as dietary supplements. The agency last month asked a contractor to
study amino acids and similar products on the market.
   Once the results of that study are in and the mystery of EMS is
solved, the agency will be in a position to decide if any changes
should be made in the regulatory setup, says the FDA's Archer.
   Wurtman believes L-tryptophan and other amino acids should be
sold as over-the-counter drugs, complete with dosage
recommendations and warning labels.
   Like Wurtman, Dyan Humphries of Denver believes the EMS epidemic
was preventable.
   After EMS left Humphries' 55-year-old mother in severe pain and
unable to move, Humphries spent eight months researching the
disease. She formed the Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome Foundation to
act as a clearinghouse and to provide support to victims.
   Treatment for Humphries' mother in a rehabilitation hospital is
being paid by Showa Denko. A spokesman for the company said it is
helping some EMS patients who require medical attention or health
care but can't pay for it. He was unable to say how many victims
are receiving assistance.
   Showa Denko has also provided more than $750,000 in grants to
research institutions to conduct independent research on the
epidemic, the spokesman said.
   More than 300 lawsuits have been filed in state and federal
courts by EMS victims - Smith, Bybee and Paulsen among them.

<HEAD>Experimental Treatment for Ovarian Cancer Could Lengthen Lives</HEAD>

   Duke University researchers are trying
chemotherapy and heat to treat six ovarian cancer patients who
haven't responded to other treatments.
   ``We've known for several decades that heat kills cancer
cells,'' said Daniel Clarke-Pearson, chief of gynecological
oncology at Duke's Comprehensive Cancer Center. ``The problem has
been learning how to keep the heat from damaging nearby organs or
healthy cells.''
   Patients in the program already have had surgery to remove most
of the cancer and chemotherapy to try to keep it from returning,
Clarke-Pearson said. ``This is a second-line treatment, used when
the standard chemotherapy isn't working.''
   Radiation and hyperthermia have been used to treat some types of
cancer, including advanced cervical cancer. But this is the first
procedure combining chemotherapy and heat. The National Institutes
of Health have renewed a five-year, $10 million grant to the
program.
   ``Ovarian cancer is such a difficult disease,'' said Dr. Jim
Barter, an assistant professor at Georgetown University. ``We have
to support any new and innovative approach to ovarian cancer.''
   Ovarian cancer will kill at least 12,400 American women this
year. It is the deadliest gynecological cancer, with a five-year
survival rate of 38 percent, according to the American Cancer
Society. Early detection and treatment can produce an 85 percent
survival rate, but finding the cancer early is hard.
   ``Even for women who get regular checkups, pap smears, an annual
mammogram - ovarian cancer is nearly impossible to detect until it
is already in the advanced stages,'' Clarke-Pearson said.
   The disease has been highlighted on ABC's ``thirtysomething,'' a
series in which the character Nancy has been diagnosed with it.
   Symptoms include a swollen abdomen and minor stomach upsets,
which many women think are stress-related or indigestion,
Clarke-Pearsonsaid.
   In the new treatment, the anti-cancer drug cisplatin is infused
directly into the abdominal cavity. The woman is then placed in a
special hyperthermia apparatus where the drug, the abdominal cavity
and small portions of adjacent body tissue are heated to 104.9
degrees. The average human body temperature is 98.6 degrees.
   The hyperthermia treatment consists of microwaves traveling
through plastic bags filled with saline that are placed in the
abdominal cavity.
   The patients are awake although slightly groggy due to
anti-nausea drugs.
   ``We know that cisplatin is the most effective drug we have at
this time for ovarian cancer,'' said Dr. James Oleson, who heads
the treatment program. ``We also know from studies that the effects
of the drug are increased several-fold by heating it.''

<HEAD>March of Dimes Opposes Criminalization Of Drug Abuse in Pregnancy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation says
it opposes criminalizing drug or alcohol abuse during pregnancy on
the basis of risk to the fetus.
   ``Addiction is an illness and there is no evidence currently
available to demonstrate that the threat of criminalization will
deter addictive behavior,'' the foundation said in a statement.
   Besides, fear of prosecution may keep women who most need
prenatal care away from health care professionals, the organization
said.
   More than 40 such prosecutions are pending, Lori B. Andrews of
the American Bar Foundation in Chicago said at a recent March of
Dimes luncheon.
   Authorities in Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio and South Carolina are among those
who have brought cases, she said.
   Newborns who test positive for illegal substances are legally
considered neglected minors in Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Nevada
and Oklahoma, she said. Such newborns must be reported to child
welfare agencies in Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey,
Oklahoma and Utah, she said.
   The March of Dimes said drug abuse programs are largely
unavailable to pregnant women, and many programs cannot provide
pregnancy-related services.
   The foundation recommended using community and governmental
resources to attack the causes and promoters of substance abuse by
women of childbearing age. Drug treatment programs that meet the
needs of pregnant women must also be made available on demand, the
foundation said.
   Such needs include medical care, child care, nutritional
services and help with education and job skills, said Dr. Reed
Tuckson, the foundation's senior vice president for programs.
   The foundation said cocaine use by a pregnant woman puts the
fetus at risk for miscarriage, low birthweight, neurological
damage, organ malformation, stroke before birth and chronic health
problems.
   Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can produce fetal alcohol
syndrome, which causes mental retardation, the foundation said. It
can also raise the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and death in
early infancy.

<BYLINE>Skis and Coronaries: Can a Rocky Mountain High Lay You Low?
^By IRA DREYFUSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you've practiced, exercised and stayed
clear of the standard risk factors, experts say you probably have
no reason to worry about having a heart attack because of skiing in
the mountains.
   Be aware, they say, that racing from the lowlands to the
mountains, combined with repeatedly dashing down a ski run in the
cold, can make your heart beat a lot faster than you might expect.
   Heart rates in two-thirds of 149 men studied in Vail, Colo.,
were above 80 percent of their predicted maximum, said a study in
Archives of Internal Medicine.
   `If you went to a cardiologist and said, `How fast do you think
someone's heart rate gets while skiing?' they wouldn't guess it
would get up to 80 or 90 percent,'' said Dr. Robert F. Grover, the
study's lead author.
   The experts wired the men with transmitters, and measured the
skiers' heart activity as they headed down Vail's least-challenging
run.
   The researchers wanted to see if skiing would trigger
irregularities - and, at heart rates this fast, they expected some,
especially in men over 40, who comprised two thirds of the group
they studied.
   They found, however, that the skiers stood up surprisingly well
to the excitement, 19-degree temperatures and 11,500-foot altitude.
There were no more signs of heart irregularities in the skiers than
in men of average fitness doing moderate exercise at sea level.
   The researchers had predicted more in the skiers.
   One possible explanation is that people who spend what it costs
to ski in Vail must be fairly dedicated and therefore probably
healthy, said Grover, an emeritus professor at the University of
Colorado School of Medicine.
   ``Most of these guys were in fairly good shape,'' he said.
   Middle-aged men who are considering a ski trip to a mountain
resort and who are not in good shape should get a checkup, he said.
This especially applies to people with common indications of
possible heart trouble, such as high blood pressure, high
cholesterol, a smoking habit, or a family history of heart disease,
he said.
   Heart attacks seem to be relatively uncommon in skiing at Vail,
said John Atkins, director of conditioning for the U.S. Olympic
Alpine ski team, and a sports medicine consultant at the Steadman
Hawkins Clinic of the Vail Valley Medical Center. However, he said,
statistics may not be entirely reliable.
   ``A lot of people will not have a major problem while skiing,
but will have one at the hotel or condo,'' he said. ``It won't get
listed as a ski injury.''
   If you feel lightheaded or dizzy, and develop a rapid or
irregular pulse, sit, breathe slowly and try to relax, Atkins said.
If things don't improve after 30 seconds, ``have someone call the
ski patrol and let the professionals handle it.''
   He noted, however, that those symptoms could be caused by
fatigue - or altitude sickness.
   In addition to a checkup, pre-trip conditioning can help to
avert trouble, Atkins said. At least six weeks ahead, a skier
should start a program of aerobics and flexibility, he said.
   On the slopes, he should avoid fatigue by not trying to pack the
most ski time he possibly can into his vacation, he said. Fatigue
also can lead to more common injuries, such as knee problems, that
result when muscles are no longer up to the strain of skiing.

<HEAD>Kids in the Kitchen: Underfoot May Breed Understanding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next time the kids cram into the kitchen while
you're cooking, think twice before you shoo them away.
   Children are cooking more, both because of the microwave oven
and because they often are asked to start dinner before parents get
home from work, experts say. Getting to know the kitchen can help
the kids, too.
   ``Instead of coming home and grabbing a bag of chips, they would
make a baked potato in the microwave. Especially for snacks,
they're willing to eat better,'' said Lois Tulsty, assistant
manager of publications for Betty Crocker.
   Children who take part in meal planning and preparation are more
likely to eat well, according to the Children's Television Network,
creator of ``Sesame Street.''
   Parents still are responsible for what their offspring eat, but
children are ``more willing to try things that they make
themselves,'' said Vicki Lansky, author of ``Kids Cooking.''
   And teaching children to help in the kitchen is probably as good
for the children's self-esteem as for their eating habits, she
said.
   Children's cookbooks are one way to get them involved. The 1990
``Betty Crocker's New Boys and Girls Cookbook'' (Prentice Hall
Press, $9.95) is the fifth revision of its recipe book for children
ages 8 to 12.
   The first, published in 1957, cost $1. And that's not the only
difference:
   - Yogurt appears nowhere in the early book; in the new one, it's
in five recipes, including a vegetable dip - something that doesn't
appear at all in the first book.
   The new book also has many more fruit and vegetable dishes and
snacks with cereals and raisins. Cakes and cookies were more
prominent in the first book.
   - Even when recipes are retained, there are differences. Both
books have sloppy joes, for example. In 1957, they're made with
ketchup, tomato soup and ground beef. The 1990 recipe calls for
celery, onion, pepper, spaghetti sauce and ground beef.
   - Brand names are omitted in the 1990 edition; they are
everywhere in the earlier book. Fewer cakes are made from mixes
this time around. There's no longer a chapter on campfire food.
   - In the 1990 book, for the first time, recipes come with
microwave directions. Surveys and research have shown children's
use of the microwave oven is growing.
   ``It's viewed as safer than using the oven or the burners,''
Tulsty said.
   But there have been concerns expressed about children getting
burned from food that gets too hot in a microwave, that splatters
in the oven, or that is not left to stand long enough after taken
out of the oven. The danger is greater for children who do not
follow directions well.
   Both books are clear and easy to read. While the new edition
focuses more on healthy foods, both try to make food fun - cakes
are decorated like igloos or drums or pumpkins, faces are drawn on
cookies or hamburgers, pancakes are ``branded'' with initials, and
a a large star is made from watermelon triangles.
   ``All the recipes have been tested at home by children,'' Tulsty
said. ``They give us feedback - whether they would make it, whether
they like it, whether they can make it, if they have problems.''
   Some food is familiar - chocolate chip cookies and spaghetti,
for example. But the recipes also include more exotic ingredients -
brie cheese, curry powder, dried herbs, grits and quiche.
   In addition to making children comfortable in the kitchen,
parents should teach their children how to read food labels and
talk with them about advertisements for food, Lansky said.

<HEAD>Tulane Researchers Say AIDS Vaccine Kept Monkeys From Getting
Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The vaccine researchers announced last year
for a simian version of AIDS has kept one group of monkeys from
getting the disease, but has not helped after infection, the team
leader reported.
   Scientists at Tulane University's Delta Regional Primate
Research Center infected 30 monkeys with the virus. Half then
received vaccinations and boosters, while the est were given
placebos.
   After 11 months, the vaccination did nothing to halt the
disease's progression. There was no difference between the two
groups, and half died, including monkeys in both groups, Michael
Murphey-Corb said at a recent New Orleans conference on the use of
monkeys in AIDS research.
   ``I don't think it's a setback,'' she said. ``I'm still very
optimistic about immuno-prophylaxis,'' the technique, like that
employed against polio, in which humans are protected against a
disease before being exposed to it.
   She said it should have no effect on vaccine research.
   ``I am disappointed personally, Murphey-Corb said. ``It would
have been such a wonderful thing to tell the human population
because we have this large population that can't be helped with
immuno-prophylaxis.''
   The vaccine protected eight of nine monkeys from infection. When
Murphey-Corb announced this last year, Dr. Wayne Koff, chief of
AIDS research at the National Institutes of Health, called it ``the
most significant advance in the vaccine field since we started the
AIDS vaccine program.''

<HEAD>Researchers to Capture Endangered Wolves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILOXI, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six of the seven endangered red wolves born
on Horn Island in May will be captured by researchers and moved.
   A male will be brought in to mate with one female that will
remain on the island.
   ``We'll bring in another male as soon as we get the others off
the island,'' said National Park Service biologist Ted Simons.
   The Horn Island wolves are a successful part of an effort to
rescue the wolves from the brink of extinction. In 1975, only 17
wolves existed in captivity; the population has grown to 130.
   The Horn Island wolves are some of the first in 15 years to be
born in the wild and live in the wild.
   ``They've done very well,'' Simons said. ``They're ranging over
the whole island, eating mostly rabbit.''
   There's a 50 percent chance that another family of red wolves
will be born in the spring, Simons said.
   The wolves have had a beneficial effect on the island, reducing
the number of nutria and rabbits, which eat the island's
vegetation.
   The young wolves, weighing 50 to 60 pounds, will be taken to a
wildlife preserve in South Carolina, where scientists hope to
establish a permanent wolf population, Simons said.
   Horn Island will be used as a breeding ground for wolves for
three more years, but it is not large enough to be home for a
permanent population of wolves, Simons said.

   Ten years from now, it's a good bet people won't be asking,
``Where were you on Aug. 2, 1990?''
   But if an entire year can pivot on a single date, then 1990
turned on that summer Thursday, when Iraqi troops rolled into
Kuwait and trampled a lot of assumptions about how the new world of
the 1990s was going to unfold.
   Remember the peace dividend? That was the big bonus that was
going to accrue to society when the Cold War had thawed.
   Remember $1-a-gallon gas?
   A lot of things changed after Saddam Hussein unleashed his tanks
on a little ``oil-igarchy'' to which most of the world had been
paying plenty of money but scant attention. But, then, it was
already a year for rethinking old assumptions. A lot of them didn't
seem to apply any more.
   They didn't apply to the Soviet Union, which abandoned Karl
Marx's dream and staggered, not altogether happily, into the free
market.
   They didn't apply to Europe, where the twain of East and West
met along the rusted remnants of the Iron Curtain.
   They didn't apply to South Africa, where some of apartheid's
tallest fences were torn down, including the one that kept Nelson
Mandela captive for 27 years.
   They didn't apply to Latin America, where two former military
dictatorships - Chile and Brazil - completed the transition to
democracy.
   And they didn't apply to the United States, where people
wondered: What is art and what is obscenity? What is the meaning of
the words, ``Read my lips: No new taxes?'' And what is America's
proper place in the world?
   America's place at the dawn of the '90s was in Panama, where
U.S. soldiers were blasting Manuel Noriega out of hiding and into a
Florida prison with strategic rock 'n' roll.
   That kicked off a year of wars and rumors of wars. Americans
fittingly sought lessons in the nation's bloodiest saga, the Civil
War, which was revived on movie screens (``Glory'') and television
screens (``The Civil War'').
   On the home front, the economy rode to the end of a boom and
then busted, although government economists twisted their tongues
every which way to avoid using the dreaded R-word - recession. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average crested at a fraction below 3,000 in
July, and slid slowly downhill from there.
   But nobody needed the Dow to read the end of the high-rolling
'80s. The Greed Decade imploded in 1990, when Donald Trump had to
be hauled out of a $65 million hole; when junk bond king Michael
Milken was dethroned in a federal fraud case and his company,
Drexel Burnham Lambert, went belly up; when taxpayers got their
bill for the savings and loan debacle - a cool $500 billion,
including interest.
   ``People have a hard time comprehending greed at so large a
scale,'' Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa said of the S&amp;L scandal.
   People also had a hard time comprehending the difference between
``taxes'' and ``revenue increases.'' President Bush won the 1990
Doublespeak Award from the National Council of Teachers of English
for being against the former and in favor of the latter. No matter.
Taxpayers understood that ``revenue increases'' would cost them
just as much as taxes, and they didn't like it.
   At midterm elections, voters grumbled and groused and then
returned most of the same old faces to office. But most people
didn't even bother to vote; in China, the American elections were
held up as an example of the failures of democracy.
   Other cracks also showed in the American mosaic. Despite small
signs of progress in the national drug war, drug abuse and the
violence attending it continued to erode the quality of life in
many cities. New Yorkers despaired over children killed in the
crossfire of drug battles. Washington Mayor Marion Barry was
convicted of cocaine possession and sentenced to prison.
   Battle lines formed along the boundaries between art and
pornography, music and obscenity.
   The photographs of the late Robert Mapplethorpe, by turns
sensuous and shocking, were at the center of a fight that pitted
religious fundamentalists and political conservatives against civil
libertarians and artists.
   The battle came to a head in a courtroom in Cincinnati, where
jurors acquitted a museum director of obscenity charges for
displaying photographs that depicted, among other things, one man
urinating into the mouth of another.
   ``The pictures were not pretty. No doubt about it,'' juror James
Jones told The Cincinnati Enquirer. ``But, as it was brought up in
the trial, to be art it doesn't have to be pretty.''
   Jurors reached the same conclusion in the trial of the rap group
2 Live Crew, whose members were charged with obscenity for playing
songs from their album, ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be,'' at a
nightclub in Hollywood, Fla. They, too, were acquitted.
   In Los Angeles, the longest criminal case in American history
skidded to a halt after seven years when jurors deadlocked on eight
child molestation counts against former McMartin Pre-School teacher
Raymond Buckey. The judge declared a mistrial.

   OPEC will continue pumping oil at high
levels to offset crude losses caused by the Persian Gulf crisis,
officials said.
   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said Wednesday
the 13 nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
would sign a statement endorsing continued increased production.
   The nations also are expected to promise to reduce their output
to levels set in late July, once the gulf crisis has ended. In
August, after Iraq invaded Kuwait, the cartel temporarily suspended
its quota system to permit higher pumping by nations with spare
capacity.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - AT&amp;T and MCI agreed to settle lawsuits that
charged false advertising and customer theft, and proposed new
federal standards to prevent consumers from being switched from one
long-distance company to another against their will.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and MCI Communications Corp.,
which had sued one another over their multimillion-dollar ad
campaigns, agreed Wendesday to settle the suits out of court.
   They also settled an AT&amp;T suit against MCI and its telemarketing
agent that alleged false and deceptive sales practices. Terms of
the agreement were not disclosed.

   NEW YORK (AP) - CBS Inc. said it plans to spend a healthy share
of the bounty it has amassed through asset sales over the past few
years by offering to buy back up to about 44 percent of its stock
for $2 billion.
   The buyback is aimed at reducing the market supply of CBS stock
in the hope of raising its price, which has sagged under the weight
of weak earnings due to lower ad revenue and losses from sports
programming.
   CBS also said Wednesday it lost $55 million this year on
major-league baseball coverage and will charge $115 million against
fourth-quarter earnings to cover anticipated losses in the
remaining three years of its contract.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Both first-time home buyers and move-up buyers
may find it somewhat more difficult to obtain a mortgage under rule
changes announced by a major government-sponsored purchaser of
loans.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie Mac, said
Wednesday it would phase out its purchases of low-documentation
mortgages and of adjustable-rate mortgages with less than a 10
percent downpayment.
   Purchases of those types of loans, both considered somewhat
riskier than standard mortgages, will be eliminated entirely after
March 31. Freddie Mac buys mortgages from banks and thrifts and
then resells them to investors to provide liquidity in the mortgage
market.
   ---
   MIAMI (AP) - Prosecutors charged that former officers of a
Florida savings and loan funded illegal campaign contributions and
diverted $38 million in deposits to cover losses on speculative
investments.
   Three ex-officers of the failed Fort Lauderdale-based
Commonwealth Savings and Loan and an investment broker were named
in two indictments Wednesday. Prosecutors said the acts were a
significant reason for Commonwealth's failure in July 1989 after
the thrift absorbed a $33 million loss.
   ---
   BOSTON (AP) - Trying to rediscover a recipe for success, Digital
Equipment Corp. has shuffled some of its top executives while the
computer maker tries to cut costs by about $1 billion.
   Also looming on the horizon are possible layoffs, which would be
the first in Digital's 33-year history.
   For months, Digital has been seeking ways to cut costs to cope
with a slump in computer sales. Mark Steinkrauss, director of
investor relations for the Maynard-based company, said Digital is
trying to reduce its expenses by about $1 billion, though the
figure is only a rough target.
   ---
   BOSTON (AP) - Struggling with a string of losses, Data General
Corp. announced that two of the computer company's founders will
take early retirement, including 52-year-old Chairman Edson D. de
Castro.
   De Castro will retire Dec. 31, and Vice Chairman Herbert J.
Richman, 56, will leave the company at the end of its fiscal year
in September. The company Wednesday gave no reasons for the
retirements of the executives, who were among the founders of Data
General in 1968.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Now that the Persian Gulf crisis has made crude
oil a hot commodity, the New York Mercantile Exchange may be in for
some competition.
   The neighboring Commodity Exchange, which shares the same
trading floor with the Merc, has discussed a deal with London's
International Petroleum Exchange that could lead to crude oil
trading on the Comex, officials said Wednesday.

   VESTAL, N.Y. (AP) - A U.S. telecommunications company said it
had signed an agreement to build and operate a cellular phone
network for the Soviet republic of Byelorussia.
   CommStruct International Inc. is committing an initial
investment of $7 million to introduce service to about 4,000
residential and mobile customers in the city of Minsk by mid-1991,
the company said Wednesday. More than 200,000 customers in Minsk
will be able to receive the service when the system is completed.

<HEAD>Southland Wields New Restructuring Tool As It Goes Before Judge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVAN RAMSTAD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southland Corp., parent of the 7-Eleven retail
chain, is hoping to make a quick trip through bankruptcy court, and
has lined up some convenient allies.
   Southland, with annual sales of almost $8 billion, filed a
``prepackaged'' Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan on Oct. 24. The
Dallas-based company is the largest of a handful of troubled
companies that have sought to streamline their time under court
supervision with a reorganization approved by most creditors ahead
of time.
   Typically, a company files for Chapter 11 protection and then
presents a judge with a reorganization plan that must be approved
by creditors, a time-consuming process.
   Attorneys for Southland and creditors who have approved the plan
will argue its merits before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson
on Friday. Some related issues regarding the sale of a Dallas
skyscraper Southland built are to be argued before Abramson next
week.
   Southland officials believe prepackaging will allow the company
to get through the bankruptcy within six months.
   ``If we are able to get our plan confirmed by the court, then we
would be out in a relatively short period of time and that would
benefit our business,'' said Cecilia Stubbs Norwood, a Southland
spokeswoman.
   In prepackaging, the reorganization must be approved by at least
half of the bondholders holding at least two-thirds of the debt. If
a judge approves, the terms of the plan are then imposed on the
dissenting minority.
   That makes prepackaging a powerful weapon for creditors against
the holdouts who will never approve a company's reorganization
plan, hoping instead to wait for separate, often better, terms.
   ``The prepackaged plan is a nice, balanced way of giving
creditors say so in the future and permitting the company to
reorganize in a rapid, efficient way,'' said Dallas attorney Mark
MacDonald, who helped Republic Health Corp. reorganize in such a
way.
   Prepackaging is seeing greater use since Merv Griffin's Resorts
International Inc. used a form of it last year. Donald Trump is
using a prepackaged plan in the restructuring announced this month
of his Taj Mahal casino. Lettering-machine maker Kroy Inc. of
Scottsdale, Ariz., has also filed a prepackaged bankruptcy
proposal.
   Republic, a Dallas-based owner of 14 hospitals, filed a
prepackaged Chapter 11 plan last December to restructure debt it
took on in a 1986 leveraged buyout. Republic emerged from
bankruptcy in April and earned a profit during the last quarter of
its fiscal 1990, which ended August 31.
   Southland sought protection from creditors have failing to get
enough bondholders to go along with a restructuring required to
help deal with the debt accumulated in a $4.9 billion leveraged
buyout in 1987. The company said it would not be able to meet
obligations next year if the debt wasn't restructured.
   Southland first proposed a restructuring last March, when it
announced the sale of most of the company to Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd.
and Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd., its Japanese affiliates. The
buyers would provide $430 in new cash for stock in the reorganized
company.
   The bankruptcy plan is similar to this restructuring, which
failed to gain acceptance by 95 percent of Southland bondholders,
although a majority signed on, making the prepackaging option
feasible.
   Companies with operational problems or strife between many
creditors could not use prepackaging to reorganize, said New York
bankruptcy attorney Steven R. Gross, who also represented Republic
Health.
   There are also dangers in prepackaging, such as a mistake being
made outside the court's view and then not detected until a judge's
only alternative is to order a new filing.
   But a prepackaged bankruptcy may give a restructuring company a
boost before a judge, Gross said.
   ``A bankruptcy judge looking at a prepackaged plan or taking the
risk of two or three years of bankruptcy for a company ... the
judge is going to err on the side of getting that company out,''
Gross said.
   ``If everyone is sitting there saing `Let's go,' that's very
hard to resist,'' he said.

<HEAD>Troubled Thrift With Largest Junk Bond Holding Sues Milken for
Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association has filed a
$6 billion civil lawsuit accusing Michael Milken and other former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. officials of fraudulently peddling junk
bonds in the 1980s.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday by the failing savings and loan,
claims that Milken and others manipulated and coerced Columbia and
other thrifts into buying billions of dollars worth of the risky
high-yield bonds.
   ``Absent such deceit and manipulations it would have been clear
that the market for junk bonds was highly illiquid and that junk
bonds were unsuitable investments for savings and loan
institutions,'' the suit says.
   Columbia once was a major Drexel customer. It holds a junk bond
portfolio with a face value of over $4 billion, the largest of any
thrift. Milken had a close business relationship with former
Columbia chairman Thomas Spiegel, who resigned last year.
   Milken, the former head of Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based
junk bond department, was sentenced last month to 10 years in
prison for six felonies related to illegal trading practices. None
of the charges involved junk bonds.
   The lawsuit by Columbia, filed in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, names Milken, nine other Drexel officials and more than
100 investment partnerships sponsored by the collapsed Wall Street
firm.
   It alleges that the thrift lost more than $2 billion on
investments in junk bonds and seeks three times that amount under
federal racketeering and antitrust laws.
   Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, said in the lawsuit that
Milken and other Drexel officials manipulated, coerced and deceived
the thrift by promising that the market for the bonds would remain
active and the thrift would make money.
   In a statement, a spokesman for Milken said the lawsuit was
without merit. The statement said Columbia was an independent
institution that made its own investment decisions, often in
disagreement with Milken.
   ``It is outrageous now to blame Michael Milken for losses as a
result of strategies and decisions that were implemented long after
he was no longer active at Drexel Burnham Lambert, and which he did
not endorse or agree with,'' the statement said.
   Milken resigned from Drexel last year but the statement said he
had gradually reduced his day-to-day activity after he was linked
to the government's Wall Street investigation in late 1986.
   It said the lawsuit amounts to ``shifting the blame to the most
convenient scapegoat on the financial scene - Michael Milken - who
has been blamed for every problem facing the U.S. economy except
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.''
   The lawsuit joins scores of other civil complaints against
Milken for alleged wrongdoing related to his guilty plea as well as
other trading activity during his tenure at Drexel, which is now in
federal bankruptcy court proceedings.
   The 176-page lawsuit by Columbia also claims that Milken and
other Drexel employees appropriated stock in buyouts for themselves
via the investment partnerships that should have gone to junk bond
buyers in the deals.
   The suit accuses Milken and others of manipulating the junk bond
market, giving bribes and stock investment opportunities to some
thrift executives, misappropriating valuable stock interests in
junk bond deals, skimming profits from junk bond trading, and
controlling through illegal means a web of thrifts and other
investors in junk bonds.
   Columbia was one of many savings and loans, big investors and
other institutions that invested heavily in deals financed or
supported by Drexel in the 1980s.
   Columbia says in the suit that its junk bonds have a total face
value of $4.3 billion, but that it has written down their value to
$2.5 billion to account for the decline in their market price. It
also says it has suffered actual losses of $200 million through the
sale of some bonds.
   The suit says Columbia was ``ill-equipped'' to make use of
relaxed federal laws in the early 1980s that allowed thrifts to
invest in corporate securities such as junk bonds. It alleges that
Milken and the others exploited this weakness.
   The savings and loan is expected to be take over soon by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as part of the nation's costly
thrift bailout.
   The FDIC and Resolution Trust Corp., which administers the
failed thrifts, already have filed a claim for $4.5 billion against
Drexel in federal bankruptcy court alleging that fraudulent junk
bond dealings caused Columbia heavy losses.
   Also named in the Milken lawsuit are former Drexel chief
executive Frederick Joseph; Milken's brother, Lowell, also a former
Drexel executive; Peter Ackerman, Drexel's former chief of capital
markets; and other officials.
   As part of his settlement of criminal and civil charges by the
government, Milken has agreed to place $400 million in a fund to
compensate investors harmed by his actions. But he would remain
liable for awards exceeding the amount in the fund.

<HEAD>Auto Slowdown To Continue, Executives Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The yearlong slowdown in the U.S. auto industry
will continue into the first half of next year, but the business
may begin picking up in mid-1991 if war doesn't break out in the
Mideast, auto executives say.
   In separate briefings Wednesday, General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co. officials forecast industrywide car and truck sales of
about 13.5 million vehicles next year, down from about 14.2 million
this year.
   If the 13.5 million figure proves true, 1991 will be worst year
for U.S. vehicle sales since 1983, when the industry was coming out
of the dismal days of the early 1980s.
   The predicted sales downturn, coupled with forecasts of poor
fourth-quarter financial results by carmakers and severe cuts in
production, have prompted Wall Street analysts to say GM, Ford and
Chrysler Corp. are in a recession.
   Most of the lost profits and problems faced y the Big Three are
in North America, where they do the bulk of their business. But on
Wednesday, GM Chairman Robert Stempel and Ford President Philip
Benton predicted things will begin turning up in a few months.
   ``North America will begin to break into the black,'' Stempel
said, adding that it depends on what happens in the Middle East.
   Earlier in the day, Benton made similar comments.
   ``We see continued weakness in the first half of next year
followed by moderate recovery, if the Mideast situation can be
resolved,'' Benton and Ford Chairman Harold Poling said in a joint
statement.
   Since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which sent oil prices
skyrocketing and put a chill on an already cool U.S. auto industry,
the Big Three have been wrestling with uncertainty in the
marketplace.
   GM President Lloyd Reuss said automakers would be hurt in 1991
not only by a soft U.S. economy, but by lower production due to a
previously announced reduction in assembly line speeds next month
and various plants being shut down for model changeovers in 1991.
   GM, the world's largest automaker, has set an aggressive
new-product introduction schedule for next year, with a variety of
new cars and trucks due in dealer showrooms, including a revamped
Pontiac Grand Prix, Cadillac Seville and full-size Chevrolet Blazer
sport-utility vehicle.
   The downturn the industry finds itself in today started about 14
months ago, when the car and truck sales began hitting the skids.
   Benton said the industry was beginning to show signs that it was
coming out of the downturn just before the Mideast crisis erupted.
   Despite the forecast of an overall downturn in sales, Benton
said he expected Ford's share of the domestic market to grow in
1991 from 1990's expected share of about 23 percent.
   He also said Ford expected Japanese automakers to boost their
share of the U.S. market next year from their current share of
about 24 percent. Benton declined to say who would lose share to
Ford.
   Stempel declined to estimate GM's market share for next year,
other than to say that gaining even a tenth of a percentage point
in the market would be a tough fight.
   On other matters:
   -Reuss said the startup of GM's new Saturn Corp. cars has been
slower than expected because of quality problems at the
subsidiary's Spring Hill, Tenn., plant. The slow start has left
some Saturn dealers with as few as one or two cars on opening day,
and that has raised a question among some dealers about
compensation from GM.
   ``We have made no particular (compensation) decision yet,''
Reuss said.
   -Benton and Stempel acknowledged that there was pressure on the
rich dividends both companies pay their shareholders. Neither said
the dividends - at 75 cents a share for each company - were in
particular trouble, but neither guaranteed that the company would
maintain that level of return on investment.
   -Executives from both companies forecast the beginning of an
economic recovery in mid-1991, provided there is no war in the
Middle East.

   The Canton, N.C., fire chief - Phillip Smathers - shipped out
with the reserves and took along the city building inspector:
Phillip Smathers.
   Big Stone Gap, Va., lost its local police sergeant, two members
of its volunteer rescue squad and four voices from the Lonesome
Pine Community Chorus.
   The chorus, more lonesome than ever, has canceled its annual
Christmas concert.
   Across America, the deployment of troops for Operation Desert
Shield in Saudi Arabia has changed daily life in unexpected ways,
pushing spouses into new roles and removing key players who often
wear more than one important hat in the towns where they live.
   It also has knocked the economic wind from communities heavily
dependent on reservists or on nearby military bases that are
emptying out as Iraq's occupation of Kuwait drags into its fifth
month.
   The central Texas town of Killeen, reeling from the call-up of
20,000 of the 38,500 soldiers from nearby Fort Hood, has become an
economic disaster area.
   ``I feel the mayors of these cities across the country who are
responsible for these people affected should have been briefed on
what to expect,'' Mayor Major Blair said. ``After all, we're the
ones who pay taxes to support this operation. We provide the
infrastructure for these military people. Now that infrastructure
is being shattered.''
   Fourteen businesses have closed, including six car dealers, a
steakhouse and two gas stations, one of which had been in town 25
years, Blair said. Business is down as much as 60 percent for other
merchants, rental occupancy is half its usual level and 1,000 area
homes are vacant.
   The city and local college are documenting the problems and plan
to use them in a plea for assistance to the U.S. Department of
Commerce, Blair said.
   ``They can provide all these funds for acts of God disasters,''
he said, ``and nothing has been addressed with respect to economic
disasters at the hands of the government.''
   Businesses ranging from auto dealers to pizza parlors say sales
are off by 30 percent to 80 percent in St. Robert, Mo., a town of
1,700 near Fort Leonard Wood in south-central Missouri.
   Thomas Moore, assistant manager of a local supermarket, said the
base's 25,300 soldiers, civilians and dependents formed the area's
economic backbone. ``The whole town revolves around the base,'' he
said.
   The same might be said of Hinesville, Ga., where homes sales are
down as much as 30 percent and many rentals stand empty since
14,000 soldiers left nearby Fort Stewart.
   ``I think every business in town is affected,'' realtor Allen
Brown said. ``There are a lot of people concerned.''
   Among them is Howard ``Curley'' Gainous, owner of Curley's
Barber Shop, whose $10,000-a-month business has been devastated by
the loss of thousands of close-cropped military customers.
   ``It's been terrible. The first month it dropped to less than
half. Then it dropped even more,'' he said.
   It's the same story 3,000 miles away, at Charlene's House of
Beauty in Twentynine Palms, Calif., near the Marine Corps Training
Center. Charlene Luongo watched her profits evaporate as thousands
of Marines pulled out of the nation's largest such base, followed
by many of their wives and girlfriends.
   ``The way I understand it, they went home to Mama,'' she said.
``I've lost about 50 percent of my business.''
   Tony Jones has watched business fall off by more than 20 percent
at the laundry and car wash he owns in Hopkinsville, Ky., near Fort
Campbell, which has deployed 17,000 soldiers so far. The sooner
they return, the better.
   ``Yesterday would have been too late,'' Jones said. ``When you
sit here and chart your business ... I think you realize they mean
a lot to us.''
   In some communities, individual departures have meant more than
local residents might have imagined.
   The trial of a man accused of murder and attempted murder in
Grand Forks, N.D., was postponed because his defense attorney was
called to active duty.
   Seven doctors at hospitals in the Pascagoula, Miss., area were
called up last month, leaving three hospitals in the region without
any plastic surgeons.
   The parks and recreation director in Watauga County, N.C.,
shipped out this month. Reidsville, a North Carolina town of about
13,000, lost its only police narcotics officer, Mac Ellison, who
also was a member of the countywide narcotics task force.
   Wewoka, Okla., gave up one officer and one dispatcher to
military service, a blow for a department of 10.
   ``It creates some hardships for us,'' said City Manager Greg
McElroy. ``It's created a shortage we're trying to fill.''
   Walhalla, N.D., said goodbye to 20 of its 1,429 residents,
including mailman Dale Anderson.
   ``There's nothing like having him here,'' Mayor Pat Hardy said.
``We're still getting our mail, but we'd rather have him.''
   In Cando, N.D., Nancy Rader feels the same way about husband
Gary, called up in September. Since then, she's been running their
small durum and grain farm and preparing this month for the birth
of their fourth child.
   At Fort Stewart, Ga., Army wives and girlfriends have been
coaching kids' sports and other women during childbirth, standing
in for absent spouses. Some 700 women are expected to give birth by
March at the base hospital, and many of them will have other women
supporting them.
   Out on the football field, women are calling the plays.
   ``We've got some boys who at first thought, `These women don't
know anything about football,' '' said Charlotte Clabough, whose
husband, James, is in Saudi Arabia. ``I feel we've won their
confidence.''

   Operation Desert Shield won't protect the
nation's weapons makers from lean times or save thousands of
workers from layoff, military experts said.
   Give or take a tank here and a missile system there, defense
contractors say they are sticking by their gloomy forecasts. And
lawmakers still talk about legislation to help communities hardest
hit by defense budget cuts.
   Even with a war, the outlook does not necessarily improve for
arms contractors.
   ``To the extent that this conflict creates the outlook for peace
in the Middle East, it worsens the prospects for major defense
contractors,'' said Thomas Lloyd-Butler, an analyst who watches
defense contractors for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
   The most immediate financial beneficiaries of the deployment of
U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf are small manufacturers of
uniforms, personal items, protective gear and food. The Pentagon is
spending billions on shiploads of sun screen, cold drink mix,
desert-camouflaged clothing, prepared meals and bottled water.
   But there's been no comparable surge in orders for weapons
manufacturers. The predictions of lean times that preceded the Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi forces remain unshaken.
   ``We're looking over the next five years at a declining defense
budget, there's no doubt about that,'' said Pete Schmidt, an
analyst with the Defense Budget Project, a Washington-based think
tank. ``What Desert Shield has done is affect the slope of the
decline. It's not going to be as steep. It's not shrinking as
fast.''
   There have been some exceptions. The Land Systems Division of
General Dynamics - which encompasses plants in Michigan, Ohio and
Connecticut - gained a windfall in the sale of some 700 tanks to
Saudi Arabia.
   Raytheon Co. of Lexington, Mass., has already sold the Saudis
$1.1 billion in antiaircraft missile systems and will likely sell
more.
   Though there haven't been any additional orders for the new C-17
transport plane, airlift was in short supply during the deployment
to Saudi Arabia and the Pentagon may increase its buy. The planes
are made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. with engines from Pratt &amp;
Whitney.
   Pratt and the other major jet engine maker, General Electric
Corp., may also benefit from new orders and maintenance contracts
for plane and helicopter engines. The desert heat and sand lead to
frequent engine overhauls and replacements.
   ``There's no doubt this isn't detrimental,'' Schmidt said.
``They're smiling. They're smiling all the way to the bank.''
   Rey Aponte of the Army Materiel Command said that while there's
been no rush of new orders for weapons, that's being considered in
higher echelons of the Pentagon.
   But unless a war breaks out, bringing on the wholesale
destruction of weapons and the need for new equipment - and maybe
not even then - ``all you've done is slightly postpone how
precipitous the decline will be in the defense budget,'' said Ron
Hertenstein, research vice president at Forecast International, a
Connecticut-based consulting firm.
   A war could actually hurt military contractors who are primarily
involved in future-oriented research and development projects.
   ``In a shooting battle you produce more of what you've got on
line ready to go,'' said Schmidt, the analyst with the Defense
Budget Project. ``Your modernization gets put on hold.''
   The Defense Budget Project recently looked into the question of
which contractors might be hurt by a Persian Gulf War. Contractors
involved in the B-2 bomber project and the Advanced Tactical
Fighter, particularly Northrop Corp., might lose heavily if a war
cut into funding for the costly aircraft.
   The costs and requirements of war might, under Schmidt's
analysis, require a reversal of the defense spending strategy
outlined earlier this year by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee. Nunn said the Pentagon should
modernize weapons within a lean budget.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the ranking Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee and a former secretary of the Navy, said
the sudden cost increases of Desert Shield may be offset by
contributions from foreign countries and by the decline of the cost
of manning the NATO front in Europe.
   The most likely beneficiaries of Desert Shield among weapons
makers, Warner said, will be those who make ammunition and
missiles, like Martin Marietta Corp. and Raytheon.
   One after another, spokesmen for the major defense contractors
said they're not profiting from Desert Shield.
   Bob O'Brien, McDonnell Douglas: ``I don't think any hardware
manufacturer has a surge in orders ... You can't just spit these
things out.''
   Alvin Spivak, General Dynamics: ``There hasn't been any
immediate significant increase in sales of our products as a result
of the Mideast situation.''
   George Jamison, GE: ``There's been no significant impact.''
   One official for a military contractor who asked to remain
anonymous said the company's board is predicting further reductions
in defense spending when the president proposes a budget in
January.
   ``If anything, it's looking worse,'' the official said. ``The
Pentagon, as far as we know, is in for more severe cuts.''

<HEAD>CBS Offers To Buy Back 44 Percent of its Stock for $2 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The multibillion-dollar question at CBS Inc.
over the past three years has been what would the media giant do
with the fortune it amassed by selling most everything but its
broadcasting assets.
   CBS came up with a partial answer Wednesday - it said it is
offering to buy back as much as 44 percent of its stock for $2
billion.
   CBS said it expected to begin a tender offer in the next few
days of $190 a share for up to 10.5 million of its common shares,
or 44 percent of its 23.7 million shares outstanding. The offer is
expected to expire Jan. 22.
   The announcement gave the company's sagging stock price a lift.
CBS shares rose $5.62{ to close at $175.50 in New York Stock
Exchange trading.
   The stock has been weighed down in recent weeks by CBS's own
dour earnings projections, heavy spending on sports and program
rights, unusual costs for news coverage of the Persian Gulf crisis
and a soft advertising environment.
   Analysts said the offer may appease shareholders who wanted the
company to do something other than buy Treasury securities with the
$3 billion raised by selling its recorded music division to Sony
Corp., its magazines to a management group and other assets to
various buyers.
   ``Everybody has been saying `What will you do with the money?'
'' said John Reidy, media analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. ``This is your answer.''
   The buyback, which will reduce the market supply of CBS stock in
a bid to boost its price, also will allow the company to repurchase
at least some of the shares held by its late founder, William S.
Paley, who died Oct. 26. Estate executors told CBS recently they
might have to sell all or part of Paley's holdings in CBS to pay
estate taxes.
   Analysts also said the buyback may set a floor price for anyone
interested in buying the company, whose once pacesetting CBS
Television Network has struggled for three years to escape third
place in the prime-time ratings.
   But CBS executives said that Laurence A. Tisch, its president
and chief executive whose family is the biggest CBS shareholder
with a 24.9 percent stake, has no intention of putting the company
up for sale.
   In a separate development, the CBS board Wednesday elected Tisch
chairman, succeeding Paley in that post. Tisch will continue as
president and chief executive.
   The $190-a-share buyback price is a 12 percent premium over the
company's closing price of $169.87{ a share Tuesday.
   Jeffrey Logsdon, media analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities in
Los Angeles, said falling interest rates that threatened to cut
CBS' return on its sizeable cash holdings also may have been a
reason for the repurchase plan.
   Even as it announced the plan, the company had more unfavorable
financial news for its shareholders.
   It said it lost $55 million after taxes on its first year of a
four-year contract to telecast major league baseball games and that
it plans to charge $115 million against its after-tax earnings in
the fourth quarter to cover anticipated losses in the remaining
three years of the $1.06 billion contract.
   The company said earlier it expected a fourth-quarter loss, its
first ever excluding a restated loss in the fourth quarter of 1986,
and lower earnings in 1991.
   CBS also said its board would probably reduce its reqular
quarterly dividend early next year from the current $1.10 a share.
   Under terms of the share repurchase offer, CBS said the Paley
estate would tender all of its 1.3 million shares as would the
Tisch-controlled Loews Corp., which owns about 5.8 million CBS
shares.
   Spokesman George Schweitzer said the company felt the share
repurchase program was a better use of its cash than buying another
TV station or making a large acquisition in another business.
   He said the catalyst for the offer was the expressed need of the
Paley executors to raise money for estate taxes.
   The offer is expected to attract far more shares tendered than
the company will buy, and CBS will buy a pro-rated share of what
each shareholder tenders.
   CBS said the relative percentages of CBS stock that the Paley
estate, Loews and others own won't change as a result of the
tender.
   ``This offer will provide CBS shareholders with the opportunity
to receive a premium over recent market prices of CBS shares for a
significant portion of their shares while retaining a substantial
equity investment in the company,'' Tisch said in a statement.
   If the offer is fully subscribed and the company buys 44 percent
of what is tendered, the Paley estate would stand to get more than
$100 million while Loews would get about $480 million.
   Tisch said that after the buyback CBS still will have $800
million in cash and securities to finance current operations.

   Donald Trump's Taj Mahal Casino
Resort has until Friday to produce documents detailing an agreement
that gives bondholders half ownership of the property in exchange
for reduced interest rates.
   Representatives of the casino and its bondholders told state
gaming regulators Wednesday they have finalized their restructuring
agreement, but paperwork remains.
   ``When you start to put together a document of this size, issues
will be raised,'' said Martin Greenberg, the attorney representing
the investors holding the bulk of the $675 million in bonds issued
to build the billion-dollar casino.
   Commission Chairman Steve Perskie, who had set a Wednesday
deadline for the bulk of the documents, said he accepted the
statements by both sides that they have reached an agreement.
   However, he set a Friday deadline to receive the documents. He
repeated his warning given at the end of the first hearing Dec. 3
that delay could jeopardize the casino license of the Taj Mahal.
   The commission is examining the financial stability of the
8-month-old casino, which failed to make a $47.3 million bond
payment due Nov. 15. State law gives the commission the
responsibility to ensure each casino licensee remains financially
stable, and the power to take away a license.
   The restructuring reduces the bonds' interest rate from 14
percent to 12 percent, spreads their repayment date over 10 years
to 2000 instead of eight years to 1998, and gives bondholders half
ownership in the Taj Mahal.
   Trump, who has not attended either of the hearings, can regain a
total of 80 percent of the ownership if he can repay the bonds at
rates higher than the restructured 12 percent.
   The casino plans to enter into a ``prepackaged'' bankruptcy
agreed to by bondholders and leave Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
by spring.
   Wednesday's hearing started two hours late due to the 11th-hour
finalization of the transaction's specific terms.
   ``We've worked feverishly over the past week in an attempt to
finalize the documents,'' Trump attorney Nicholas Ribis said.
   Ed Tracy, the head of Trump's three Atlantic City casinos and
one non-casino hotel, said after the 15-minute hearing that the
final sticking points were the definitions of the deal's terms.
   If the Taj Mahal returns with the explanatory documents Friday,
the casino must then produce the overall agreement by next
Wednesday. Casino officials have said they intend to file the
overall agreement by Monday with the federal Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   The Taj Mahal, Atlantic City's largest casino, opened April 2 to
great expectations that it would become the engine that would drive
the recovery of the stagnant industry here. The casino has set
gross gaming revenue records for the city, but has failed to take
in the $1.3 million a day that analysts said it would need to break
even.
   The Taj Mahal also has stolen business from the city's 11 other
casinos, including its sister properties - the Trump Castle Casino
Resort By The Bay and Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino.
   Trump Castle faces an $18.4 million bond payment Saturday. Tracy
said he would not comment on the prospects for making that payment.
   Trump Castle failed to immediately make a $43 million bond
payment in June, setting off an emergency bank loan in which
Trump's three casinos serve as collateral. That triggered the
commission's desire to examine the Trump casinos' financial
stability.
   The commission will likely look at the other two properties at a
later date.

   Optimism about Middle East peace helped drive
prices sharply higher on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today for the
seventh straight session, while the dollar declined against the
Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 643.56 points, or 2.68
percent, closing at 24,642.97 points.
   The index now has climbed 2,780.36 points, or 12.7 percent, in
the last seven trading days.
   Volume on the first section totaled an estimated 600 million
shares, down from 625 million on Wednesday.
   Traders said investors were optimistic that talks between the
United States and Iraq would yield a peaceful settlement of the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Lower crude oil prices and lower interest rates encouraged
investors, but the biggest factor was hope for a peaceful solution
in the Middle East, said Yoshio Miyauchi, an equities trader at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia.
   Past declines already had fully reflected war fears, so the new
hopes turned sentiment around, he said.
   ``Thanks to brighter market sentiment in the past couple of
days, institutions came back to the market,'' he said.
   Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst for Nomura Securities, added:
``Factors were good, with New York prices up, the yen high and
bonds up.''
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 131.30 yen,
down 0.58 yen from Wednesday's close of 131.88 yen. It also opened
at 131.30 yen and stayed in a narrow range between 131.10 yen and
131.38 yen.
   Spot trading totaled $6.08 billion, down from Wednesday's $7.51
billion.
   Trading was slowing with the approach of Christmas in Europe and
the United States, said Tadashi Sazaki, assistant general manager
in the foreign exchange and international treasury division of the
Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   Sentiment on the dollar is mixed and, in slower year-end
trading, it probably would range between 130 and 135 yen, said
Masato Hayashi, chief customer dealer for the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``It's hard to say (whether) the dollar has bottomed out,'' he
said.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds stood at 87.82 points, down from
Wednesday's 87.90 point close. Their yield rose to 7.100 percent
from Wednesday's closing 7.070 percent.

<HEAD>NCR Board to Meet in Wake of AT&amp;T Takeover Bid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The board of NCR Corp. planned to meet for
the first time since the directors triggered AT&amp;T's hostile
takeover attempt a week ago by rejecting a $6.1 billion buyout
offer.
   NCR spokesman Mark Feighery on Wednesday confirmed that the
13-member board was scheduled to meet today, but he declined to
disclose the location or agenda.
   On Dec. 2, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. announced it had
offered to buy NCR for $6.1 billion in a $90-per-share stock swap.
NCR directors unanimously rejected the offer, saying they would not
even begin negotiating the sale of NCR unless AT&amp;T offered at least
$125 a share.
   AT&amp;T countered by announcing a $90-per-share cash tender offer
to NCR shareholders, a proposal scheduled to expire Jan. 4.
   The New York Stock Exchange halted trading in NCR shares about a
half hour before the exchange closed Wednesday after a news service
reported that a third party had contacted NCR about a possible
merger.
   However, NCR spokeswoman Connie Olasz said there was no new
information about a possible merger partner. The company has said
for some time it has had contacts with interested parties.
   NCR shares were down 37{ cents at $89.50 when trading was
stopped. Trading did not resume by the time the exchange closed at
4 p.m. EST.
   NCR's share price has been slipping in recent days as it
appeared the takeover battle could be protracted.
   The Wall Street Journal reported NCR is likely to add Goldman
Sachs &amp; Co., a Wall Street securities firm, to its lineup of
lawyers and investment bankers fighting the takeover bid.
   Feighery said he could not confirm that the company is thinking
of retaining Goldman Sachs.
   Analysts have speculated that NCR Chairman Charles Exley Jr. may
seek another merger partner or a minority investor to block the
phone company's bid.
   AT&amp;T says it wants to buy the nation's fifth-largest computer
maker to bolster its own unprofitable computer business.
   Ian Ross, president of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories - AT&amp;T's research
and development arm - said a merger would give NCR the benefit of
the lab's expertise.
   ``I think they're bound to see opportunities they never thought
of,'' Ross said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rules Frequent Fliers Can Sue Airline in State
Courts</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: AAdvantage in 10th graf is cq.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A class-action lawsuit filed by frequent fliers
accusing American Airlines of cheating them out of bonus flights
could potentially affect about 9 million people, the plaintiffs'
attorney says.
   An Illinois Appellate Court ruled Wednesday that the plaintiffs
can proceed with their lawsuit in state court.
   The airline, based in Fort Worth, Texas, had sought to move the
lawsuit into the federal courts. Airline officials contend federal
law and the U.S. Constitution had pre-empted all action dealing
with fares, service or routes.
   But the appeals court ruling rejected this argument.
   ``State courts award damages every day in air-crash cases
notwithstanding the fact the federal law pre-empts state regulation
of safety in air travel,'' Judge William S. White wrote in the
ruling.
   Attorney Michael Freed said the half-dozen plaintiffs he
represents didn't want the case in federal court because ``a case
like this is much more likely to be moved more quickly in state
courts.''
   The lawsuit does not specify the amount of money being sought,
but Freed said the award could come to ``many, many millions of
dollars.'' He said the suit could potentially affect all 9 million
participants in the American frequent flier plan nationwide.
   The plaintiffs contend American Airlines, on May 18, 1988,
unilaterally instituted a retroactive reduction in benefits for
people who had accumulated frequent flier credits.
   Freed said the plaintiffs sued after the airline reduced the
number of seats available to people trying to use their awards,
making it difficult or impossible for people to fly when and where
they wanted.
   The suit argues that the change in the rules for the American
Airlines AAdvantage frequent flier program constitutes a breach of
contract and a violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and
Deceptive Business Practices Act.
   There was no immediate word from the carrier on its next move in
the dispute. ``We are studying our options,'' American spokesman
Tom Stack said.
   Barring an appeal to the Supreme Court, the case will return to
Cook County Circuit Court for hearings on the action's merits.

<HEAD>Oil Import Bill Reduces Japan's Trade Surplus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soaring oil import costs helped Japan's trade
surplus tumble 35.6 percent in November from a year earlier to
$2.27 billion, the Finance Ministry announced Thursday.
   Without the higher crude oil prices caused by the Persian Gulf
crisis, the trade surplus would have risen during the month because
of an unexpectedly high growth in exports, a Finance Ministry
official said.
   ``I'm surprised that export volume stayed so high'' despite a
strong Japanese yen, said Patricia Kuwayama a vice president and
economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
   The trade surplus totaled $3.24 billion in October and $3.53
billion in November 1989.
   Japan's crude oil import costs ballooned 123.7 percent in
November from a year earlier to $4.57 billion.
   Overall imports, measured on a customs-clearance basis, rose
26.2 percent to $23.42 billion, while exports rose 16.3 percent to
$25.69 billion.
   Japan's trade surplus with the United States edged up 0.2
percent to $3.57 billion, ending 13 months of decline.
   The ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
a dip in crude oil costs late in the month was likely to help hold
down import figures in coming months because of the lag time after
orders are placed.
   But the slowing of the U.S. economy will prevent the trade
surplus from widening significantly because of a likely decline in
demand for Japanese products, said Chiharu Sumita of UBS Phillips
and Drew International.
   Sumita said automobile exports to the United States were strong
in November because of the introduction of new Japanese models, but
were likely to slow as that temporary effect passed and the impact
of the worsening U.S. economy deepened.
   Japan calculates its trade balance on a customs-clearance basis,
in which freight and insurance charges are included in imports but
not in exports.

<TEXT>
   American farmers love the idea of selling more food to the
Soviet Union under a $1 billion temporary aid program President
Bush created to help the Soviets fight winter shortages. They'd
love it even more if it never stops.
   Elected officials from farm states and agricultural board
representatives welcomed the move announced Wednesday, although
some said it might be too little and too late to salvage a tough
year for U.S. farmers.
   ``The president's move did not come a moment too soon,'' said
Sen. David Boren, D-Okla. ``The Canadians and the French have
already indicated they would use their heavily subsidized grains to
capture the critical Soviet market.''
   ``Let's hope that this is just the beginning,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., said Bush's decision ``will do
more to bolster the spirits of Pacific Northwest farmers than any
single decision of the administration to date.''
   Don Hutchens, executive director of the Nebraska Corn Board,
said the board has been frustrated over delays in providing credit
to the Soviet Union. He added that the $1 billion figure is too
low.
   ``That is not enough in our understanding of what the Soviets
need and it's not enough to get us up to the level of what we were
previously selling to the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Last year at this time, the United State had sold 6 million
metric tons of corn to the Soviets, compared with 420,000 metric
tons so far this year, Hutchens said.
   Steve Graham, administrator of the Kansas Wheat Commission, said
sagging wheat prices were unlikely to rise despite the news.
   ``If anything, it possibly will stop its decline, which is
positive,'' he said.
   U.S. Rep. Dan Glickman, a Democrat from Kansas, said the Soviet
Union needs far more than $1 billion in credit guarantees.
   ``If the administration wants to have a free-market farm
economy, then it must make sure that farmers have a market to take
advantage of,'' Glickman said. ``Extending credits beyond $1
billion will help create that market.''
   ``This is good news for U.S. farmers and a godsend for the
Soviet people,'' said Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa. ``Farmers are tired
of being first on the list at times of budget cuts but last on the
list during the consideration of foreign policy that reduces their
access to foreign markets.''

   The stock market was mixed today while traders
sorted through the latest data on the state of the consumer
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.96 to 2,626.24 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers held a narrow advantage over gainers in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 466 up, 482 down and
527 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.59 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported that retail sales declined 0.1
percent in November, registering a smaller drop than analysts had
been expecting.
   That sent bond prices lower and interest rates higher in the
credit markets. Prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell almost $5
for each $1,000 in face value, raising their yields to the
neighborhood of 8.11 percent.

   OPEC ministers today endorsed maintaining
high crude production to ease any oil shortages caused by the
Persian Gulf crisis, and pledged to sharply reduce their output
once it is resolved.
   Nigerian Oil Minister Jibril Aminu said the accord, which
quickly wrapped up the cartel's winter meeting that began
Wednesday, ``should firm (prices) up and send a signal (that
people) need to relax in a time of worry.''
   The ministers' action reaffirms an earlier decision to suspend
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' production quota
system and allow its 13 members to produce to their utmost.
   Iraq and Libya had opposed the move by the cartel in August to
produce excess crude. Iraq's delegate, Ramzi Salman Abdul Hussain,
said he objectedto part of today's accord since his country did
not go along with the August decision to cancel quotas.
   The suspension in August was designed to help offset shortages
caused by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of fellow OPEC member Kuwait.
   The countries wanted to make up for the shortfall of about 4
million barrels a day resulting from the U.N-ordered embargo on
trade that has cut the export of Kuwaiti and Iraqi crude.
   OPEC President Sadek Boussena said the oil chiefs pledged ``to
go back immediately'' after the crisis to a supply ceiling of 22.5
million barrels a day, which was set in July for all 13 countries.
   ``I have no doubt about this commitment,'' he told a news
conference at the end of the strategy session.
   With super-producer Saudi Arabia in the lead, the cartel has
boosted production to around 23 million barrels of oil a day,
including only small amounts from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Saudi Arabia alone was close to pumping 8.5 million barrels a
day, according to sources.
   Under the new arrangement, Saudi Arabia and other overproducers
would be required - after the gulf crisis is over - to restrain
production to the level set in late July.
   Saudi Arabia's output limit was put at 5.4 million barrels under
that agreement.
   The ministers agreed to meet again in early March to take a new
look at the situation.
   Speculation about prospects - good or bad - for war in the
Persian Gulf region has sent oil prices rising or falling since the
invasion.
   Prices for light sweet crude peaked in October at $41 a barrel.
They have since tumbled to under $30 a barrel on hints of peace and
concern about an oil glut.
   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC was
$26.25 a barrel Monday, well above its target price of $21.
   At the start of the winter conference, OPEC President Sadek
Boussena criticized oil-consuming nations for failing to do much to
ease the oil crunch.
   Instead of taking crude out of their inventories, he said, the
rich nations appeared to have added oil to their storage tanks in
case of a worsening of gulf troubles.
   The meeting drew together all 13 nations for the first time
since the invasion. Iraq and Libya did not show up for the last
meeting, at which the quota system was suspended.
   No friction was reported between Iraq and Kuwait.
   Rasheed Salem al-Ameeri, the oil minister for Kuwait's
government-in-exile, also attended the talks.
   OPEC's members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Size of Export Credits Sends Disappointed Market Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain and soybean futures opened sharply lower
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The market was driven down by disappointment over the amount of
export credits granted yesterday to the Soviet Union by the Bush
Administration.
   The $500 million to $1 billion in credits is far below the $1.5
billion and more expected by the market, said analyst Victor
Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. He noted that comments by
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., suggesting that the United States grant $3
billion in credits helped drive the market higher Wednesday.
   But Lespinasse said disappointment over the amount of credit
given the Soviets would not last long, adding that it is expected
to increase over time. He noted that President Bush plans a visit
to Moscow in February to meet with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev
   Trading in the soy oil pits received a boost on reports the
United States has granted export credits to Pakistan. That country
is expected to use the credits to buy soy oil.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.52{ a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 3 cents lower with December at $2.42{ a bushel; oats were
1} cents lower with March at $1.17} a bushel; soybeans were 5}
cents to 9} cents lower with January at $5.88{ a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The smaller than expected credit package for the Soviets also
affected livestock and pork futures. Cattle prices were further
hurt by a study indicating the daily consumption of red meat adds
to chances of colon cancer.
   Live cattle were .17 cent to .45 cent lower with December at
80.62 a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .30 cent lower with
January at 88.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .40 cent
lower with December at 49.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 1.30 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 64.92 cents a

   Livestock and pork futures settled mixed in Wednesday's trading.

   Centel Corp. announced today it has agreed to
sell its electric utility operations to Missouri-based UtiliCorp
United for $345 million.
   The sale, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be
completed in 1991, company officials said.
   ``This agreement provides an excellent return for our share
owners and continues our restructuring plan to focus on the local
exchange telephone and cellular communications businesses,'' said
John P. Frazee Jr., Centel's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Centel currently provides electric service to about 136,000
customers in Colorado and Kansas. Centel Electric had revenue of
$165 million in 1989, while reporting operating income of $29
million.
   Utilicorp's chairman and president, Richard C. Green Jr., said
he was very pleased with the purchase.
   ``This is another step in our expansion strategy,'' Green said.
   The purchase is the largest by UtiliCorp since it began a
mergers and acquisition program in 1984. UtiliCorp also said it
forecasts record financial results both for the fourth quarter and
the year.
   ``Our strategy is working, despite the abnormally mild weather
experienced in our service territory this year,'' said Green.
   Under the agreement, Centel will receive $325 million in cash
and UtiliCorp will assume about $21.3 million in current
liabilities related to the electric properties. The deal also class
for direct purchase of electric transmission, distribution and some
generation assets.
   Utilicorp, based in Kansas City, Mo., provides gas and electric
service to customers in eight states and British Columbia, Canada.
The company said it would retain all Centel employees.
   Chicago-based Centel, which had 1989 revenue of $1.19 billion,
provides local telephone service in nine states, and operates
cellular communications franchises in 15 states.

<HEAD>SEC Accused 10 Brokers of Penny Stock Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators on Thursday charged 10
brokers with bilking investors of about $1.4 million through
fraudulent penny stock sales, in a case that names only the
securities salesmen and not their firms.
   A civil lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court said the
brokers conducted illegal trading at several firms using techniques
that included pressuring investors to buy stock, refusing to let
them sell and promising prices to rise.
   The complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission
alleges the brokers made more than $270,000 in commissions from 60
defrauded customers, and seeks recovery of all ill-gotten gains.
   The salesmen worked for several penny stock brokerage firms that
have been targeted in the past by federal securities enforcement
officials. The lawsuit alleges illegal trading practices from 1986
to the present.
   All the brokers worked at the Garden City, N.Y., office of J.T.
Moran &amp; Co., which went out of business in February and is under
investigation by federal authorities. Some previously had worked at
the Huntington, N.Y., branches of First Jersey Securities Inc.,
closed by regulators in 1987, and Sherwood Capital Inc., the SEC
said.
   ``What happens is if a firm goes out of business these people
just pack up and go somewhere else,'' said Martin A. Kuperberg,
associate regional director of the SEC's New York office. ``They're
the soldiers in this thing and they're not going to escape
commission scrutiny.''
   Lawyers for the brokers did not immediately return telephone
calls seeking comment.
   Among the charges, the SEC said the brokers told investors they
had inside information about companies, guaranteed quick and
substantial earnings from the stocks, indicated they were not
making any commissions from trades and pressured customers to buy
securities.
   According to the complaint, one broker told a customer he would
double the client's money within three months. Another salesman,
told by a customer that he wanted to talk to his wife about an
investment, allegedly asked, ``Who wears the pants in your
family?''
   Penny stocks are cheap stocks in companies whose shares are
traded over the counter and not on any exchange. Their shares often
sell for as little as $1, making them susceptible to artifical
pricing and manipulation.
   State and federal regulators in the last two years have targeted
rampant penny stock fraud in numerous indictments and regulatory
actions, and business in the industry has declined. Two of the
nation's biggest penny stock firms, Stuart-James Co. and Blinder,
Robinson &amp; Co., closed earlier this year amid mounting legal
problems.
   The brokers named in the SEC complaint are Robert F. Hasho,
Benjamin M. Hasho, William X. Mecca, Robert B. Yule, Kevin B.
Sullivan, David C. Dever, Richard A. Chennisi, Aurelio Vuono,
Philip Falcone and Michael F. Umbro. No addresses or ages were
given.

<HEAD>Japan's Exclusive Construction Market Lets in Some U.S. Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HIRSH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. construction companies have eked out $100
million in business under a 1988 agreement to pry open bidding in
one of Japan's most exclusive markets, a senior U.S. official said
Thursday.
   But that's only a fraction of the $2.5 billion their Japanese
counterparts have made in the U.S. market, and U.S. and Japanese
negotiators are still far apart on how to close the gap, said J.
Michael Farren, under secretary of commerce for international
trade.
   ``It is less than we had hoped for, but it's better than zero,
which is what it was two years ago,'' said Farren, in Tokyo for two
days of talks to review the 1988 Major Projects Agreement.
   The two sides can't even agree on whether to continue that
agreement, which sought to cut through a tangle of Japanese
restrictions on U.S. bidding by targeting 14 Japanese construction
projects, including a $7 billion airport being built in Osaka.
   U.S. negotiators now want to expand the agreement to include
access rights to all public works.
   The Japanese, however, consider the current pact adequate as a
bridge to get some American businesses into the construction
market, Construction Ministry officials said.
   If it is allowed to expire, however, Farren sees dangers for
already tense U.S.-Japan trade relations.
   The Japanese construction industry long has been notorious for
alleged bid-rigging under the ``dango'' system. Top firms consult
secretly on bids, preventing outsiders, including foreign firms,
from getting contracts.
   Under U.S. pressure during bilateral trade talks earlier this
year, major construction companies announced they were dissolving
an executive fraternizing group at which such activities supposedly
occurred. But accusations against such companies continue to
surface.
   Farren said that since the 1988 agreement to open the market, at
least 12 U.S. firms have received licenses to bid on Japanese
construction projects. In addition, U.S. companies are involved in
more than 20 joint ventures.
   At the same time, however, U.S. companies have spent an
estimated $10 million getting licenses, he said. And if successful
bidding continues to be an uphill climb for them, ``they're going
to conclude it doesn't pay to invest in the Japanese market.''
   Farren cited a recent controversial decision by the Osaka
airport project to accept a bid for a people-mover by a Japanese
company with no prior experience. The airport coordinators rejected
a bid by AEG-Westinghouse, which has installed the equipment in
airports throughout the world.
   Just before talks on the agreement began on Wednesday, the
airport announced that bidding for its baggage system had been won
by a consortium that included a U.S. company. But Farren said he
took small comfort in the announcement.
   ``I don't find it to be much of a coincidence,'' Farren said.
``Clearly there was an effort to quell the waters with an award to
an American company.''
   Provisions in the U.S. 1988 Omnibus Trade Act call for a
decision by May 1991 on whether to begin retaliatory action against
Japan if Farren's review fails to deem Japan's construction market
sufficiently open to U.S. companies.

<HEAD>OPEC Keeps Oil Taps Wide Open But Pledges Cutbacks After Gulf
Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers pledged Thursday to keep
their oil taps wide open during the Persian Gulf crisis, but turn
them down once it ends.
   The agreement by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries caused little stir in the oil markets, which
have been skittish for months over tensions in the oil-rich gulf.
   ``What is happening in Iraq still means something for prices,
but not this meeting,'' said Peter Bogin, associate director for
oil markets at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris.
   Peter Gignoux, head of international energy at Lehman Brothers
International in London, also shrugged off the meeting as ``no big
deal.''
   Indeed, light sweet crude, the benchmark American grade of crude
oil, was up $1.25 at $26.60 a barrel late Thursday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Oil prices soared to as high as $41 a barrel after the Iraqi
invasion on fears of an outbreak of war in the gulf and a shutdown
of oil facilities.
   OPEC ministers agreed in August to suspend their quota system
and increase pumping to make up for 4 million barrels of lost Iraqi
and Kuwaiti crude. The oil was removed from the market because of
an international embargo against Iraq.
   Prices have slipped recently because of hints of a peaceful
resolution to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and worries about an
impending oil glut.
   Despite high production levels, the OPEC ministers decided this
week to continue allowing countries with spare capacity to produce
as much as possible to offset losses caused by the crisis.
   But they also pledged to reduce output as soon as the crisis is
settled, returning to a production level of 22.5 million barrels a
day set last July.
   ``I have no doubt about this commitment,'' OPEC President Sadek
Boussena told a news conference at the end of the group's winter
conference.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, is close to
supplying 8.5 million barrels a day, compared to its previous
ceiling of 5.4 million barrels a day.
   Venezuela, the United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Iran and Libya are
also pumping extra oil.
   In all, OPEC's current production is tagged at around 23 million
barrels a day and unlikely to go much higher.
   ``We are producing more or less at the maximum level,'' said
Boussena, the Algerian mines minister.
   By promising to lower production when the crisis subsides, the
ministers are hoping to avoid a sharp plunge in prices.
   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita predicted that if
the cartel holds to a level of 22.5 million barrels a day in the
spring and summer, ``we won't see a crash in prices.''
   The ministers did not give any sign that they would knock down
their target price, once the crisis ends. That target was set in
July at $21 a barrel.
   However, Rasheed Salem al-Ameeri, oil minister for Kuwait's
government-in-exile, indicated that after the crisis his country
might seek concessions from OPEC to pump more crude to restore its
oil industry.
   He said Iraqi invaders had badly damaged and looted the
industry. But he contended it could return to normal production
within several weeks of a peaceful outcome.
   ``I would hope ... that other members of OPEC would consider our
special case and would allow us a fair quota,'' he told a news
conference.
   The meeting marked the first time that all 13 nations had
gathered since the Iraqi invasion. Ministers insisted the atmoshere
was friendly and no angry words were exchanged.
   Iraq, in a letter to Boussena, did express reservations about
the presence of a Kuwaiti delegation. Al-Ameeri wrote a strongly
worded letter in return, defending his seat at the table.
   Meanwhile, Iraq's delegate, Ramzi Salman Abdul Hussain, said he
objected to wording in the new accord that continued the August
suspension of the output quota system.
   He said Iraq could not go along with it because his country did
not attend the August meeting at which the quotas were suspended.
But others noted Iraq was not affected, anyway, because its oil is
embargoed.
   The ministers announced they will meet again on March 11 for a
fresh look at the situation. They will open their summer conference
on June 4.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were lower
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as the market reacted
negatively to the size of the export credits granted to the Soviet
Union.
   Traders were disappointed with the $500 million to $1 billion in
export credits given the Soviets. The market had been expecting at
least $1.5 billion in credits would be given the Soviets, said
William Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   Biedermann said the market had been led to believe that credits
totalling $1.5 billion to $3 billion would be given to the Soviets.
   In granting the credits, President Bush lifted a 15-year ban on
such credits. The ban was imposed because of the Soviet prohibition
of free emigration.
   Wheat futures were able to come off their lows for the day on
talk the Soviets would make wheat purchases a priority. There were
also reports China may soon enter the market.
   Soyoil prices received a boost on news the U.S. State Department
has approved the awarding of $275 million in export credits to
Pakistan. The granting of credits had been held up while an
investigation was made into Pakistan's nuclear weapons capability.
It was determined such capability does not exist.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 3\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.54{ a bushel; corn was 2\
cents to 4 cents lower with December at $2.23 a bushel; oats were 1

<HEAD>Workers' Comp Costs to Reach $60 Billion This Year, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spiraling workers' compensation costs will take
a toll on U.S. employers to the tune of about $60 billion this
year, double what it took to pay for job-related injuries just five
years ago, according to a study released Thursday.
   Higher medical costs are the driving force behind the rise,
according to a recent survey of 576 medium- to large-sized
companies conducted by Tillinghast, a consulting unit of Towers
Perrin. Medical costs account for roughly 40 percent of overall
workers' compensation expenses.
   Also spurring costs are the increasing involvement of attorneys,
the exodus of private insurance companies from the market and a
widening definition of what constitutes a workplace injury, said
Jerry Miccolis, a Tillinghast vice president who presented the
report at a press conference.
   Mental stress and repetitive motion disorders emerged as new and
widespread claims during the 1980s, and employers surveyed said
they expect psychological disorders as well as injuries associated
with the use of video display terminals to increase substantially
in the coming decade, Miccolis said.
   Miccolis cited a case recently won by a woman who complained
about her inability to ``cope with a multi-ethnic environment'' as
one example of what has come to constitute psychological
``stress.''
   Nearly 70 percent of the companies polled said workers'
compensation costs are beginning to take a toll on their financial
results, and 35 percent said they expect costs to be ``out of
control'' in the next five years.
   Because workers' compensation rules vary from state to state, 40
percent of companies surveyed said they consider the cost of a
state's system before deciding where to locate their operations.
That factor is considered by 56 percent of manufacturers.
   When it comes to fixing the system, employers have the greatest
incentive to make changes, Miccolis said, adding that after all,
``it's their money.''
   Most programs employers use to help contain costs are effective,
the survey said. For example, 84 percent of those surveyed have
safety programs, 64 percent screen potential employees and nearly
half audit medical bills.
   ``Only when employers impose rigorous controls will benefit
costs moderate ... and the system refocus on its basic purpose:
fostering a safe work environment and getting injured workers
high-quality care and back to productive employment,'' Miccolis
said.
   Workers' compensation, first enacted in Wisconsin in 1911, was
designed as an employer-paid, no-fault insurance program to protect
workers on the job. In return for such protection, employees gave
up the right to sue their employers, but litigation has increased
substantially over the years, as have the scope of compensation
claims.

<HEAD>Recession, Emission Orders, Restructuring Prompt Charge For Engine
Maker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN KUSMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cummins Engine Co.'s announcement Thursday
that it will suffer losses through the first quarter of 1991
underscore the toll the recession and new emission orders are
taking on the trucking industry, an analyst said.
   The Columbus, Ind.-based engine maker said it expects a
fourth-quarter loss ``substantially'' greater than the $33.7
million deficit it racked up in the third quarter. It also expects
a loss in the first quarter next year.
   Further, Cummins said it would take a pre-tax charge against the
fourth-quarter loss to pay for restructuring.
   The announcement was expected, given the current economic
climate overall and new emission orders from the Environmental
Protection Agency taking effect Jan. 1 that are expected to add
$1,500-$2,000 to the cost of each truck engine, said Frank
Prezelski, an industry analyst with Rothschild, Inc.
   ``If it's not a recession, it's close enough. I think we're
going to see a bottom (for the truck industry) in the first
quarter,'' Prezelski said.
   The EPA order caused early buying for new trucks because of the
added costs. It's also delaying new orders because of questions
over how well the new engines will perform with added controls.
Potential customers want to see how new engines from various
companies hold up for others before they commit to buy, Prezelski
said.
   ``First-quarter demand shifted to fourth quarter. ... Most of it
is related to these emission orders,'' Prezelski said. ``You've got
a really nasty first quarter for the truck people. There's very few
who are going to make money.''
   Cummins has reduced its payroll by more than 500 employees
worldwide in recent months in dealing with the slumping truck
market. It also is eliminating certain operations and consolidating
manufacturing plants. The cost of the resulting charge against
results has not been determined, it said.
   The company has about 25,000 employees worldwide.
   ``We are experiencing softening of several of our markets in the
United states, most notably the truck market, which is our major
market,'' said company spokeswoman Ann C. Smith. ``We are also
seeing a softening of the (diesel) generator market for
recreational vehicles and marine.''
   The company said worsening business conditions in Brazil also
were hurting company results. Cummins Brasil S.A. in Sao Paulo
produces engines for industrial and marine use as well as diesel
generators.
   The third-quarter loss amounted to $2.55 per share and came on
sales of $829.8 million in the period. At that time Cummins
announced it had already trimmed more than 300 salaried and hourly
employees worldwide and would reduce its production force in
Columbus by an additional 210 workers.
   For the first nine months of the year, Cummins reported a loss
of $18.7 million, or $2.64 per share, on sales of $2.6 billion.
   Prezelski is forecasting a fourth-quarter loss of about $45
million in addition to restructuring charges of $15 million to $30
million.
   Cummins in July sold a combined 27 percent stake in the company
to Ford Motor Co., Tenneco Inc. and Japanese engine-maker Kubota
Ltd. for a total of $250 million. That investment now is providing
a needed cash cushion, Prezelski said.
   ``It would have been a lot tougher fo Cummins Engine had that
not occurred,'' he said.

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. said
Thursday it was dropping its hostile bid to take over Kansas Gas
and Electric Co.
   The company, which earlier this month extended its $27-a-share
bid until Jan. 11, announced the offer for all outstanding common
and preferred shares was being terminated.
   It said it also would withdraw merger applications it had filed
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Kansas
Corporation Commission and the Missouri Public Service Commission.
   KG&amp;E, based in Wichita, had rebuffed the KCPL effort from its
start in July and in October negotiated a friendly takeover
agreement with Topeka-based KPL Gas Service Co., which offered $32
per share.
   At that time, KCPL said it would continue to pursue the
acquisition, saying it might even be willing to raise its bid if it
could get information from KG&amp;E that would support a higher price.
Wall Street analysts had put KG&amp;E's value at between $31 and $33 a
share.
   But on Thursday, Drue Jennings, president and chief executive
officer of KCPL, said his company had decided to drop out of the
running.
   ``We began our offer for Kansas Gas and Electric intent on
achieving a negotiated transaction that would provide unequaled and
tangible benefits to all the communities and constituencies served
by both companies, including customers, employees and
shareholders,'' Jennings said. ``We still believe in the unique
benefits of such a combination today.''
   The company still felt its offer was ``full and fair,'' but its
board decided it was ``not in the interest of our customers,
employees and shareholders to compete'' with KPL Gas Service ``at
the value levels they perceive.''
   ``In light of this, we believe it is prudent at this time to
withdraw our offer,'' Jennings said.

<TEXT>
   Waterford Wedgwood Group PLC, the ailing
Anglo-Irish crystal and china maker, said Thursday it plans to
split its operations into two businesses.
   It also said its chief executive had resigned as a result.
   ``We believe that it is important for the future development of
the group to give operating autonomy to each of our businesses,''
chairman Howard Kilroy said in a statement.
   The glass and ceramics operations will each have their own board
of directors, management, capital investment program, resources and
balance sheet, Kilroy said. The two will maintain some marketing
links, he said.
   Irish-based Waterford had acquired Britain's Wedgwood for 250
million pounds, or $488 million, in 1986.
   The restructuring will enable the managements to develop their
own well-known brands. The businesses will be more cost-effective
because significant group overheads will be eliminated, Kilroy
said.
   Chief Executive Officer Paddy Byrne issued a statement saying he
supported the reorganization, but saw no appropriate role for
himself in the new structure. Byrne, 49, has held the post since
April 1989 after working for the company for about two years.
   His resignation was effective immediately, the company said.
   Robert Davies, the group's chief financial officer, was named
acting chief executive of the international ceramics business and
will oversee the restructuring. Paddy Galvin, Waterford's chief
executive, will become business chief of the worldwide crystal
business, the company said.
   Waterford Wedgwood, which depends heavily on the American
market, has been hurt recently by the drop in the dollar this year.
The company also has been troubled by labor disputes with its
workers.

<TEXT>
   Vista Chemical Co. announced Thursday it will
merge with the German company RWE-DEA in a $590 million cash deal.
   RWE-DEA will buy all of Vista's outstanding common shares for
$55 per share, according to a definitive merger agreement signed by
both companies.
   The tender offer will begin by next Wednesday, and will be
followed by a cash merger in which any shares not tendered will be
converted to cash at the same price.
   ``This merger agreement, which was consummated on an entirely
friendly basis, not only provides the best value for Vista
shareholders, but also represents a sound and exciting future for
our employees,'' said John D. Burns, Vista's chairman, president
and chief executive officer.
   Houston-based Vista makes commodity and specialty chemicals used
in a variety of products, including household laundry detergents,
shampoos, cosmetics, automobile trim and fittings, vinyl packaging
materials, home siding and wire and cable coatings.
   Vista's net income for the 1990 year ending Sept. 30 totaled
$63.3 million on sales of $719 million. The company, formed in
1984, has about 1,850 employees and owns or leases nine principal
manufacturing and production facilities.
   RWE-DEA is an independent operating subsidiary of RWE AG, a
publicly held holding company involved in electricity, mining, oil
and chemicals, machinery, construction and waste management. RWE AG
owns more than 99 percent ot RWE-DEA's stock.
   RWE-DEA, formerly known as Deutsche Texaco AG, is involved in
oil refining, marketing, exploration and production of oil and
natural gas. The company, based in Hamburg, Germany, has about
6,200 employees and also manufactures a wide range of petrochemical
basics and chemical products.
   It had net income of $120 million in 1989.
   ``The combination of Vista and RWE-DEA provides a unique
opportunity to expand significantly into the global chemicals
market,'' said Armin Schram, RWE-DEA's chairman.
   Schram said the company did not expect the deal to result in any
significant changes in Vista's structure. He said no layoffs were
anticipated, and Vista plans to keep its corporate headquarters in
Houston.
   The merger is expected to be completed by July 1, 1991. At least
two-thirds of the common stock must be tendered.
   Vista cannot solicit takeover proposals, but the company may
terminate the merger agreement if it receives a better offer from a
third party.

<HEAD>Group Files Suit Against French, British Companies Over Software
Piracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An alliance of some of the world's top computer
software manufacturers has filed lawsuits against subsidiaries of
France's Rhone-Poulenc SA and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC,
seeking to limit software copyright violations.
   Representatives of the Business Software Alliance and the
Association Francaise des Editeurs de Logiciels said they found
pirated copies of computer programs at the headquarters of
Rhone-Poulenc Films SA.
   Members of the two associations inspected the Rhone-Poulenc Film
headquarters earlier this month, and are demanding the equivalent
of about $1 million in damages from the firm.
   Rhone-Poulenc officials were not available to comment on the
charges.
   The Business Software Alliance and the British Federation
Against Software Theft also said Wednesday they visited the offices
of General Electric unit Marconi Instruments Ltd. last month,
leading them to file a similar suit against the London-based
electronics maker. General Electric of Britain is not related to
the U.S. company of the same name.
   The Marconi investigation came after U.S. software makers
Ashton-Tate Corp., Lotus Development Corp., Microsoft Corp. and
Wordperfect received a court order last month approving the search.
   Hugues Leblanc, president of the French software association,
said it was the first time software companies were allowed to
inspect without warning the offices of a company suspected of
copyright infringements.
   The action by the software groups came a day before European
ministers in charge of preparing for the 1992 unification of the
European market adopted common legislation to protect software
against piracy.
   The ministers, meeting Thursday in Brussels, agreed that
software manufacturers' programs may be disassembled by users in
order to create links so that they may be used with incompatible
programs.
   The practice was one of the main issues of contention among the
ministers. Under the agreement, such ``reverse engineering'' will
be allowed without authorization from the copyright holder when it
is ``indispensable for obtaining information necessary for
interfacing a program that has been created independently of other
programs.''
   Robert Holleyman, general manager of the British software group,
said at a Paris news conference Wednesday that the industry groups
have several other investigations in progress in France, Britain,
and elsewhere in Europe.
   The software groups are committed to coordinated action in
Europe to fight computer piracy, Holleyman said.
   Losses due to software piracy in the 12 European Economic
Community countries totaled about $26.5 billion in 1989, according
to the Business Software Alliance.

   Hallmark Cards Inc. did some reshuffling
among its top-level management to reflect Chairman Donald J. Hall's
diminished role in recent years, the company's president said.
   The Kansas City greeting card company dissolved the three-member
office of the chairman and replaced it with a four-person corporate
executive committee.
   It also hired former BATUS Inc. President Henry F. Frigon to be
chief financial officer and fill the newly created post of
executive vice president-corporate development and strategy.
   Hallmark also renamed its main greeting card and related
businesses from the Social Expression Group to the Personal
Communication Group. That group will form a committee to look at
ways to expand the business internationally and through other
means.
   The reshuffling reflects the lessened role that Hall has been
playing, said Irvine O. Hockaday Jr., president and chief executive
officer.
   Hall, 62, remains the chairman and is still an important
presence at the company his father founded, Hockaday said. Hall
said in a statement to employees that he supports the changes
``enthusiastically.''
   Hall, Hockaday and Vice Chairman David H. Hughes have served
until now as the office of the chairman, the top executive
committee at the $2.5 billion company, which is the nation's
largest greeting card firm. Hughes retires at the end of the year.
   Hockaday and Frigon will share the new corporate executive
committee with Robert A. Kipp, group vice president of corporate
communications and services, and Robert L. Stark, executive vice
president of Hallmark Cards Inc. and president of the Personal
Communication Group.
   Frigon will occupy a new layer of management and will overseethe finance,
tax, and corporate development and planning divisions.

reported signs of improvement heading into the crucial last 10 days
before Christmas.
   Business is picking up for some retailers who started off the
season slowly, a spot check around the country revealed.
   The London Harness Co., which sells briefcases and other
specialty gifts in Boston, has seen its business increase each
weekend of the holiday season, said Christine Hyland, the store
manager.
   ``We're following last year's patterns, which is the best we can
hope for at this point,'' she said.
   Manufacturers who supply merchandise to stores are also seeing
some signs of a pickup.
   ``The last few days have been better than the last few weeks,''
said Al Teller, chairman of MCA Inc.'s music entertainment group,
which manufactures records, compact discs and cassettes.
   This past weekend was strong enough that ``there seems to be
some reasonable degree of optimism,'' Teller said Wednesday.
   But business is still off at some retailers.
   Joseph DeLuca, president of I.J. Fox furs in Boston, said his
sales are down about 10 percent compared with last year.
   ``We are not making the figures we would like to, but it's not
going to be a disaster,'' he said.
   The weather continued to be an obstacle in many areas. While
temperatures remained unseasonably in some parts, making it hard
for shoppers to feel in a holiday mood, it snowed heavily in other
areas.
   In the Midwest, Younkers Inc. saw its sales drop after some of
its 34 stores were closed because of heavy snow. Des Moines got 10
inches of snow and as much as 15 inches fell in other parts of
Iowa.
   Sales at many retailers have tumbled so far this season because
consumers, concerned about the faltering economy and the Middle
East crisis, have been buying fewer and cheaper gifts. That
sluggishness helped drag down overall retail sales during the month
of the November, the government reported Thursday.
   The slow season has had a dampening effect on store employment
in some areas.
   Orders from retailers for temporary help are clearly down this
year, Jeff Green, a manager in the Minnesota Department of Jobs and
Training said earlier this week.
   And Pete Moor, an office manager for Job Service, an employment
agency in West St. Paul, Minn., said he has seen ``very little
activity'' in the way of retail requests for temporary help this
season.
   ``Our placements have been down over the past month,'' Moor
said. ``We haven't noticed any pickup and it's getting late (in the
season.)''
   In the Dallas area, ``Just looking at number of job openings we
had, our overall orders in the retail business is somewhat below
what we had last year,'' said Ron Rogers, a placement supervisor
with the Texas Employment Commission.
   Some retailers said their staffing has been unaffected by
economic problems this season.
   Nordstrom Inc. hired about the same number of part-time workers
for its 62 clothing stores as it did last year, spokesman Tim Doke
said. At Dayton Hudson Corp., spokeswoman Ann Barkelew said
staffing at the company's department, discount and apparel stores
also was running in line with 1989 levels.
   Many retailers have staffed conservatively, but also made
provisions for increasing the number of sales help should business
improve substantially.
   At Pier 1 Imports, a store might normally have 10 staffers and
20 for the holidays. But this year, that same store likely will
have 15 employees for Christmas, Chairman Clark A. Johnson said.
   ``We're calling in other people as required'' at the company's
554 outlets, Johnson said.
   Pier 1, like many other retailers, depends heavily on part-time
help, so if more staffing is needed, employees are asked to work
longer hours, Johnson said.
   Johnson reported business at his stores is running ahead of last
year's levels and ahead of projections. He said his home furnishing
chain has benefited from consumers who are ``trading down,''
searching for less expensive gifts than last year.

<HEAD>GM Subsidiary Opel Hailed for Big Investment in Eastern Germany</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. subsidary Opel signed an
agreement Thursday to invest $675 million in an auto plant in
former East Germany.
   The company was hailed by the German government for helping to
develop the economically backward region.
   ``We need important symbols of investment,'' German Economics
Minister Helmut Haussmann said at a signing ceremony.
   Louis R. Hughes, the American chairman of Adam Opel AG, called
on other international investors to take action to help the people
of eastern Europe who have ousted socialist regimes in favor of the
free-market system.
   ``It will not do just to say that the market economy is the
better system. We must prove it through our business,'' Hughes said
after signing the pact with the Treuhandanstalt, the trust agency
in charge of most of the former state-owned assets of former East
Germany.
   Opel, a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors Corp., will
build a plant in Eisenach to make 150,000 Corsa and Kadett models
annually. It will create 2,600 new jobs, Opel said, with the first
cars to come off the assembly line in late 1992.
   The investment is a boon to the united Germany, which fears as
many as one-quarter of the 8 million workers in former East Germany
may become unemployed as inefficient companies from the state-run
system collapse or contract. The government hopes for massive
investment in the region from German and foreign companies.
   Opel was one of the earliest companies with foreign ties to show
interest in eastern Germany. Even before East and West Germany were
unified in October, Opel had arranged to have its Vectra models
assembled in Eisenach at the plant making the Wartburg, the second
most popular east German car after the tiny Trabant.
   Automobiles have been made in Eisenach since 1899 when a
two-cylinder Wartburg was produced. But even with the Opel
investment, the future of the local auto industry is unclear. The
trust agency hasn't decided what to do with the Wartburg plant,
which has 7,000 workers.
   Wartburg director Wolfram Liedtke urged the trust agency to make
a quick decision. ``If the Treuhand doesn't decide, in theory I
can't build any more cars after Jan. 1,'' he said.
   Without continued Wartburg production, Liedtke said, more
skilled workers will leave for western Germany. He said 600 had
already left this year.

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose $2.88 Billion in Latest Week</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week
ended Wednesday.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 534 money market mutual
funds rose $2.88 billion in the latest week to an all-time high of
$428 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday came despite an
easing of interest rates that generally tend to make money-market
fund investments less attractive relative to stocks and bonds.
   The fund-asset total broke the record set the previous week,
when the figure advanced a revised $1.26 billion to $425.13
billion. The Washington-based mutual fund trade group originally
reported the total for the week ended Dec. 12 at $424.89 billion.
   ``There was virtually no change in the level of money-market
fund assets held in individual accounts, but the rapid build-up of
assets held in institutional accounts continued unabated,'' said
Dr. Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist at the
institute.
   ``Even though yields offered by institutional money-market funds
again eased a bit, the yield differential in their favor over
direct money-market instruments widened considerably,'' he said.
   The institue said that in the latest week, assets of 267
general purpose funds rose $309.6 million to $150.65 billion,
assets of 104 broker-dealer funds dropped $387.3 million to $166.14
billion, and assets of 163 institutional funds rose $2.95 billion
to $111.21 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.22 percent from 7.27 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.28 percent from 7.31 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
53 days, up from 52 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
5.96 percent as of Wednesday from 5.98 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.05 percent from 5.07 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.41
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.50 the
previous week. Yields were 7.51 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
7.60 percent; 7.62 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.70 percent;
and 7.86 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 7.95 percent.

<HEAD>Oil Up $1.07 As War Fears Make Partial Comeback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices rallied Thursday, moving up about $1
per barrel on the futures market as traders renewed their focus on
the possibility of war in the Persian Gulf.
   Light sweet crude oil rose $1.07 to $26.42 per barrel at the New
York Mercantile Exchange on contracts for delivery in January.
   ``The market's getting a little bit nervous again,'' said
Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   Traders got the jitters amid news stories on persistent troubles
the United States and Iraq have faced in trying to set up
diplomatic meetings to discuss the desert standoff.
   In financial markets, the news stories were inflated into rumors
that the talks would not be held at all, pushing crude prices
higher from the open, Hittle said.
   In the afternoon, the rally gained momentum after Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein announced he wants peace in the Gulf but
would gladly wage war to prevent foreign domination of Arab oil or
land.
   ``It was more of the bellicose rhetoric,'' Hittle said.
   Crude's rally came on the heels of nearly two weeks of losses
rooted in perceptions that a peaceful solution could end the Gulf
crisis. Prices settled Wednesday at their lowest levels since Aug.
3, the day after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Oil also got a boost Thursday from OPEC's announcement that it
would keep pumping all the crude it can during the crisis, but
return to its previous quotas once the standoff ends.
   As oil prices moved up, most other energy futures traded higher.
   The main exception was home heating oil for January delivery,
which fell .06 cent to 74.57 cents a gallon. Heating oil was higher
for nearly all later delivery months.
   Some traders were apparently selling the heating oil contracts
and buying unleaded gasoline futures, which were relatively cheap,
closing at 65.57 cents a gallon, up 1.08 cents, for January
delivery, according to Randall Rothenberg, a broker at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. Gasoline for delivery in later months was higher.
   Natural gas, which is not directly affected by the potential for
war in the Middle East, finished mixed. January delivery contracts
were up 1.6 cents at $2.22 per 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEAD>Bank Props Up Finances with U.S. Treasury Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New England Corp. has been bolstering its
frail finances with U.S. Treasury money, but the bank said Thursday
it does not need the funds to stay afloat.
   The bank, crippled by mountains of bad real estate loans, has
been trying to rebuild slowly under the supervision of federal
regulators.
   During this time, the bank has participated in a program where
tax money is deposited in banks until the Treasury needs the funds.
Federal officials say banks routinely use this system to improve
their liquidity and that Bank of New England received no special
treatment.
   But financial experts question whether the government is
essentially propping up troubled institutions.
   Bank of New England's fortunes fell quickly last year when the
region's real estate market slumped, exposing problem loans. The
bank lost more than $1 billion, and depositors pulled out about $7
billion.
   That prompted the bank to borrow heavily from the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston to meeting pressing needs for cash.
   In February, Bank of New England signed consent orders with the
U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, which required the company to
take steps to improve its operations. A section in the orders
called for the bank to improve its liquidity.
   Ellen Stockdale, a spokeswoman for the comptroller's office,
said her agency knew Bank of New England was using Treasury
deposits to improve its liquidity.
   ``If we thought they were doing something grossly irresponsible,
we would stop it,'' she said. ``This is not the first time a bank
in trouble has done this.''
   Under the so-called ``tax and loan'' deposits, about 3,000 banks
across the country collect tax money that is held in accounts for
the Treasury. The Treasury routinely draws money from the accounts
to maintain a $5 billion balance at the Federal Reserve.
   When tax receipts run high during certain periods of the year,
excess money is deposited in about 170 banks around the country,
according to the Treasury.
   Bank of New England, with assets of $23 billion, holds Treasury
money under both of those systems, federal officials said. But the
excess deposits are not considered dependable since the Treasury
usually pulls them within a few days.
   Bank of New England's Treasury deposits hit a peak in April, at
$1.8 billion, said James Dorsey, a bank spokesman. But a statement
from the bank called this figure ``irrelevant'' since April is tax
time when Treasury deposits are at their highest levels.
   Dorsey said Bank of New Englad had been holding Treasury
deposits before the company's financial troubles arose, and he
noted that the deposits as of Wednesday totaled $77 million,
compared to $18 billion in total deposits.
   ``If we didn't have $77 million, would we be liquid? Of course
we would,'' he said.
   The bank stopped borrowing from the Federal Reserve in June, and
instead has been lending money to other banks while retail deposits
have climbed steadily, Dorsey said.
   Meanwhile, federal officials stressed that the Treasury deposits
are backed by collateral and money is not at risk. The Treasury
said it has never lost money on these deposits, and specific banks
are not targeted to receive funds.
   But Stuart Greenbaum, a professor of financial institutions at
the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern
University, said the government has some discretion with the way it
deposits its money.
   In that sense, he said, the government may be trying to help
keep Bank of New England open while the company addresses its
troubles.
   Stockdale, at the comptroller's office, said the bank has missed
some deadlines specified in the consent order, but ``you can adjust
around it a little bit.''
   ``They are working on their problems,'' she said.
   Morris Mendelson, a finance professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School, said when the government provides
such help, it is not motivated totally by mercy. If a bank fails,
then the government could face the costly task of paying off
deposits.
   In a letter this month to the Senate Banking Committee, Robert
Glauber, the Treasury's under secretary for finance, said the
agency has not used deposits to fund banks that experience
financial troubles.
   Bank of New England shares moved up 12{ cents to $1.12{ in
trading of New York Stock Exchange stocks Thursday.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended Dec. 3, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,311.8 billion from $3,324.7 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,078.1 billion from $4,094.1 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $819.0 billion from $825.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 in the last 52 weeks was up 4.2 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The growth rate in M3 over the past year was up 1.7 percent, which
is within the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,319.4 billion, a 3.1
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,091.3 billion, up 0.8 percent, while M1
rose 4.7 percent to an average of $821.5 billion.
   In other reports:
   -The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $99 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$133 million the previous week.
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $318.2 billion in the two-week period ended
Dec. 12, down from $319.9 billion two weeks earlier.

   Eastern Airlines fought Thursday to avoid
disclosure of information used in the criminal investigation into
its maintenance practices, saying it wanted to protect employees
who may not be implicated in the probe.
   ``When there is any kind of ongoing investigation, there is not
a right to access,'' Eastern attorney Jane W. Parver told a
three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan D. Polkes, a prosecutor in the
criminal case against Eastern in Brooklyn, said the flying public
had a right to know what was in an affidavit used to support a
search warrant for Eastern's offices in Miami.
   ``There is no basis to keep the affidavit sealed,'' Polkes said.
``Legally, Eastern in on very thin ice.''
   Last Friday, U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser of Brooklyn
ruled the affidavit should be made public, but he gave Eastern time
to take its case to the higher court. The appeals panel did not say
when it would rule.
   Prosecutors investigating alleged safety violations at Eastern
used the search warrant to seize safety logs and other records on
Dec. 1.
   Federal officials said they were looking for evidence that
Eastern had continued to inadequately inspect its jetliners for
safety problems, even after it was indicted earlier this summer.
   In July, prosecutors in Brooklyn filed criminal charges against
Eastern, alleging a pattern of falsifying safety records and other
maintenance documents to keep its planes flying.
   Two Eastern maintenance workers at New York's Kennedy Airport
have pleaded guilty and are expected to testify against the airline
at trial next year.

<HEAD>Market Lower on Disappointing Credit Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell Thursday on the Chicago
Board of Trade in a negative reaction to the export credits granted
the Soviet Union.
   On other markets, silver was lower while gold advanced;
livestock and pork futures retreated; and energy prices gained.
   Grain and soybean traders were disappointed with the $500
million to $1 billion in export credits given the Soviets. The
market was expecting at least $1.5 billion in credits would be
given to the Soviets, said William Biedermann, an analyst with
Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   Biedermann said the market had been led to believe the Soviets
would get $1.5 billion to $3 billion in credits.
   In granting the credits, President Bush lifted a 15-year ban
imposed because of the Soviet prohibition of free emigration.
   Wheat futures were able to come off their lows for the day on
talk the Soviets would make wheat purchases a priority. There were
also reports China may soon enter the market.
   Soyoil prices received a boost on news the U.S. State Department
has approved the awarding of $275 million in export credits to
Pakistan. The granting of credits had been held up while an
investigation was made into Pakistan's nuclear weapons capability.
   Wheat settled { cent to 2 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in December at $2.54{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4
cents lower with December at $2.23 a bushel; oats were 1{ cent to 2
cents lower with December at $1.08 a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents
to 9\ cents lower with January at $5.88 a bushel.
   Energy futures advanced on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
the attention of the market returned away from the OPEC ministerial
meeting in Vienna to events in the Persian Gulf.
   Analysts said prices were boosted by Iraq's insistence that it
set a date for a meeting between President Saddam Hussein and
Secretary of State Jame Baker, and Baker's statement that Iraq is
not serious about having talks with the United States.
   OPEC ministers attending a two-day meeting in Vienna agreed to
keep production quotas suspended until the end of the gulf crisis.
Current production of 22.9 million barrels a day is outpacing
demand, analysts said.
   Light sweet crude was 46 cents to $1.07 higher with January at
$26.42 a barrel; heating oil was .11 cent lower to .59 cent higher
with January at 74.57 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.08
cents to 1.30 cents higher with January at 65.57 cents a gallon;
natural gas was .010 cent lower to .016 cent higher with January at
$2.220 per thousand cubic feet.
   Silver prices plunged to their lowest level in 14 years on New
York's Commodity Exchange but recovered somewhat while still
finishing lower for the day.
   Silver continues to suffer from a lack of investor interest,
said Bernard Savaiko, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   Slowing industrial demand also is affecting the price of silver,
about 40 percent of which is used by the film industry.
   Gold prices were higher, trading in line with crude oil prices.
   Gold was $1.60 to $1.90 higher with February at $375.10 a troy
ounce; silver was 1 cent to 2.5 cents lower with December at $4.006
a troy ounce.
   Livestock and pork futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange as traders reacted negatively to the smaller-than-expected
offering of export credits to the Soviets.
   A larger credit line was expected to lead to meat purchases by
the Soviets. But they are now likely to confine purchases to
grains.
   Cattle futures also were pressured by news of a medical study
indicating daily consumption of red meat contributed to colon
cancer.
   Analysts said the report is not likely to have a long-term
effect on beef demand, but it can be used to push futures down from
record high levels.
   Live cattle were .27 cent lower to .07 cent higher with December
at 80.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .18
cent higher with January at 88.87 cents a pound; live hogs were .03
cent to .40 cent lower with December at 49.60 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 2 cents lower with February at 64.92 cents a
pound.

   The stock market drifted through a mixed session
Thursday as traders sorted through the latest data on the state of
the consumer economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.92 to
2,614.36.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 790 up, 747
down and 505 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 162.11 million
shares, against 182.27 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 197.25 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported that retail sales declined 0.1
percent in November, registering a smaller drop than analysts had
been expecting.
   That sent bond prices lower and interest rates higher in the
credit markets. Prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell about $5
for each $1,000 in face value, raising their yields to the
neighborhood of 8.11 percent to 8.12 percent.
   The response in the stock market was not so negative. Brokers
said stock traders interpreted the figure as a sign of continuing,
but not necessarily worsening, weakness in the economy.
   Favorable news on inflation is expected Friday when the
government issues its monthly producer price index of finished
goods.
   The figure is expected to show only a modest increase for
November after taking a 1.1 percent jump in October; 1.6 percent in
September, and 1.3 percent in August.
   Vista Chemical soared 28} points to 53} on word that the company
had agreed to be acquired by a subsidiary of the German company
RWE.
   Other chemical issues were generally strong, following Vista's
lead. Union Carbide gained 1 to 17}; Dow Chemical 1 to 47}; Georgia
Gulf ~ to 8, and Great Lakes Chemical 1| to 64.
   Hilton Hotels fell back 2} to 39&rsqb; after a 6|-point runup
Wednesday on takeover talk.
   Ford Motor slipped \ to 25} in active trading on top of a

<TEXT>
   Southland Corp. has some powerful allies when it
goes before a U.S. bankruptcy judge with a restructuring plan
Friday - the people it owes money.
   The Dallas-based owner of 7-Eleven convenience stores is the
largest of a handful of companies to reorganize under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with a plan that has already been approved
by most of its creditors.
   Southland filed a ``prepackaged'' Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan in
October. The company, which had sales of almost $8 billion last
year, said it was overwhelmed by debt left from its $4.9 billion
leveraged buyout in 1987.
   The filing listed $2.53 billion in assets and $3.38 billion in
liabilities.
   Typically, a company files for Chapter 11 protection and then
presents a judge with a reorganization plan that must be approved
by creditors, a time-consuming process.
   Southland officials believe prepackaging will allow the company
to get through the bankruptcy within six months.
   ``A prepackaged bankruptcy offered us the potential of
completing the Chapter 11 process much more quickly, and would
therefore be much less disruptive to our business,'' said Cecilia
Stubbs Norwood, a Southland spokeswoman.
   Attorneys for Southland and creditors who have approved the plan
will argue its merits before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson
on Friday. Some related issues regarding the sale of a Dallas
skyscraper Southland built are to be argued before Abramson next
week.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to ask the judge
for another 45 days to review Southland's case, agency spokesman
John Heine said in Washington. The SEC believes Southland's case
will set a precedent for prepackaged bankruptcy proceedings and
merits a lengthier review, Heine said.
   Southland first proposed a restructuring last March, when it
announced the sale of most of the company to Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd.
and Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd., its Japanese affiliates. The
buyers would provide $430 million in new cash for stock in the
reorganized company.
   Prepackaging is receiving greater use since Merv Griffin's
Resorts International Inc. used a form of it last year. Donald
Trump is using a prepackaged plan in the restructuring announced
this month of his Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J.
Lettering-machine maker Kroy Inc. of Scottsdale, Ariz., has also
filed a prepackaged bankruptcy proposal.
   To make a prepackaged filing, a company must get the
reorganization approved by at least 50 percent of the bondholders
holding at least two-thirds of the debt. If a judge approves, the
terms of the plan are then imposed on the dissenting minority.
   That makes prepackaging a powerful weapon for creditors against
the holdouts who will never approve a company's reorganization
plan, hoping instead for separate, often better, terms.
   ``The prepackaged plan is a nice, balanced way of giving
creditors say so in the future and permitting the company to
reorganize in a rapid, efficient way,'' said Dallas attorney Mark
MacDonald, who helped Republic Health Corp. reorganize in such a
way.
   Republic, a Dallas-based owner of 14 hospitals, filed a
prepackaged Chapter 11 plan last December to restructure debt it
took on in a 1986 leveraged buyout. Republic emerged from
bankruptcy in April and earned a profit during its last quarter of
1990, which ended Aug. 31.
   Companies with operational problems or strife between many
creditors could not use prepackaging to reorganize, said New York
bankruptcy attorney Steven R. Gross, who also represented Republic
Health.
   There are also dangers in prepackaging, such as a mistake being
made outside the court's view and then not detected until a judge's
only alternative is to order a new filing.
   But a prepackaged bankruptcy may give a restructuring company a
boost before a judge, Gross said.
   ``(When) a bankruptcy judge (is) looking at a prepackaged plan
or taking the risk of two or three years of bankruptcy for a
company, ... the judge is going to err on the side of getting that
company out,'' Gross said.
   ``If everyone is sitting there saying `Let's go,' that's very
hard to resist,'' he said.

<DATELINE>MARYSVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co. Ltd. on Thursday
unveiled a station wagon version of its mid-sized Accord sedan, the
nation's best-selling car.
   The 1991 Accord Wagon, designed and engineered in the United
States, is the first mid-sized station wagon in the Honda line. It
began rolling off assembly lines Nov. 20 at the company's
Marysville plant, officials said at a briefing to introduce the
car.
   Although pointed primarily at the North American market, Honda
expects to export about 10,000 during the first production year,
said Thomas G. Elliott, executive vice president for automobile
sales.
   Elliott said he expects about 35,000 wagons to be sold in the
first year. He said between 4,000 and 5,000 will be marketed in
Europe and the rest in Japan and other Far East markets.
   Honda said the wagon is the first U.S.-made car the company will
export to Europe. It joins the Accord line of four-door sedans and
two-door coupes, also made at Marysville, about 35 miles northwest
of Columbus. Honda exports the Accord coupe to Asia.
   The Accord was the top-selling car in the United States last
year and is expected to be again this year when final numbers are
tallied. By adding a station wagon, the model could widen its
already substantial lead over the No. 2 seller, Ford Motor Co.'s
Taurus, which includes a station wagon version.
   Kurt Antonius, manager of public relations for Honda of America,
said the nation's station wagon sales declined sharply with the
introduction of the minivan in the mid-1980s, but is enjoying a
resurgence. He said the Honda wagon is expected to be a sport and
family vehicle.
   The wagon was designed at Honda's Torrance, Calif., facility and
engineered and tested at its central Ohio plant.
   Antonius said Honda's total sales through November were up 15
percent over 1989 and the Accord sedans and coupes will have 58
percent of the Honda market in 1990. Total Accord sales for 1990
are expected to be about 410,000 units, up from 380,000 in 1989.
   Elliott said the addition of the station wagon at Marysville
will not increase total production at the plant. Assembly of the
Civic is being shifted to Honda's new plant in East Liberty, less
than 10 miles away, and assembly of the station wagon will be mixed
with that of Accord's four-door and two-door coupe models.
   It will be available in two models - the 125-horsepower LX and
the 140-horsepower EX - both with a standard five-speed
transmission or the optional four-speed automatic. Both have
2.2-liter, four-cylinder engines.
   Depending on the model, the wagon will cost $17,300 to $19,800.
It also was expected to get 20 or 22 miles per gallon in city
driving and 26 or 27 miles a gallon on the highway, also depending
on the model.
   Base prices for the Honda wagon are higher than those of the
Taurus, which range from $15,629 to $19,128. The Honda is slightly
longer and narrower than the Taurus, but has a longer wheelbase.
   The announcement of the new car came as the nation's
fourth-largest automaker reported U.S. sales for the year running
15 percent ahead of last year. It said 676,981 Honda automobiles
were sold through November, compared with 589,090 at the same time
in 1989.
   Honda, the first Japanese automaker to build cars in the United
States, employs more than 9,000 people at four auto, motorcycle and
engine plants in Ohio.
   Honda began manufacturing in the United States in September 1979
with production at its motorcycle plant in Marysville.
   The auto plant at Marysville began production of the Accord in
November 1982, and an engine plant in Anna, in western Ohio, began
production in July 1985.
   The Civic four-door sedan was added to production at Marysville
in July 1986. Production of the engine for the Civic began at Anna
the same year.
   The company added an auto assembly plant near its Marysville
operation last year. The new plant, called the East Liberty Auto
Plant, makes Civic four-door sedans.

<HEAD>Dollar Firms Slightly; Gold Rises, Silver Hits 14-Year Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar firmed slightly against major foreign
currencies Thursday in sleepy pre-holiday trading that largely took
its cue from technical factors.
   Gold rose, while silver prices fell to their lowest level in 14
years before recovering.
   The thinly traded currency market seemed unmotivated by external
influences that brisker sessions typically take into consideration.
   Traders said there was no market reaction to a government report
of retail sales falling 0.1 percent in November, the first decline
in six months.
   While news of economic troubles generally drive down the
dollar's value against foreign currencies, traders said the
continuing prospect for war in the Persian Gulf kept them
cautiously bullish.
   War news has particularly strengthened the dollar against the
Japanese yen because Japan's economy is so dependent on imported
oil.
   ``You have two situations going against each other - someone
could make a war-like statement and that will pop the dollar up,''
said Thomas J. Palladino, a trader at Osterreichische Landerbank.
   `` People are a little afraid of taking a position one way or
another,'' he said.
   Likewise, traders said the market was not affected by the
Deutsche Bundesbank's regular meeting Thursday, which left German
interest rates unchanged.
   Traders said the lack of a definitive stance by the German
central bank on the dollar's decline left currency markets without
direction.
   ``They didn't say anything new. It was everything the market
expected,'' said Earl I. Johnson, vice president at Harris Trust &amp;
Savings in Chicago.
   The market also brushed aside rumors, later proved untrue, that
the planned meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Iraq President Saddam Hussein had been canceled.
   The dollar gained against the yen in New York, closing at 132.17
yen from 131.45 late Wednesday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a
closing 131.30 Japanese yen from 131.88 yen at Wednesday's close,
and later in London, it rose to 132.25 yen.
   The dollar also gained against the British pound in New York,
with sterling weakening to $1.9450 from late Wednesday's $1.9502.
In London, the pound rose to $1.9440 from $1.9435 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
prices, included: 1.4790 German marks, up from 1.4756; 1.2660 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2610; 5.0255 French francs, up from 5.0120;
1,115.25 Italian lire, up from 1,112.00; and 1.1607 Canadian
dollars, up slightly from 1.1606.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.4805 German marks, up from 1.4788; 1.2660 Swiss francs,
up from 1.2650; 5.0305 French francs, up from 5.0240; 1.6700 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.6675; 1,115.75 Italian lire, up from 1,113.25;
and 1.1595 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1599.
   Gold rose in New York, closing up $1.60 a troy ounce to $374.30
on the Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank later quoted a
bid of $373.35, up $1.90 from late Wednesday.
   In London earlier, the precious metal rose to a late bid price
of $372.25 a troy ounce, up from $371.75 bid late Wednesday.In
Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $372.25, up from
$371.60.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 86 cents to close at a bid
$373.48.
   Silver plunged on the Commodity Exchange but bounced back
slightly to close down 2 cents to $4.006 a troy ounce.
   In London, the metal fell to a late bid price of $4.02 a troy
ounce from $4.03 bid late Wednesday. Traders said the metal
continues to be weakened by sluggish industrial and investment
demand.

<HEAD>Trans World Shuffles Money To Get Winter Cash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By transferring stock holdings from Trans World
Airlines Inc. to its corporate parent for $77 million in cash, TWA
owner Carl Icahn is providin his troubled carrier with a cash
infusion as the slow winter travel season nears, analysts said
Thursday.
   TWA said it had sold an interest in 5 million shares of USX
Corp. to its parent, TWA Airlines, which in turn gave the carrier
the money.
   ``The proceeds of the sale would be added to TWA's general
working capital and would be used for general corporate purposes,''
the airline said in a statement that referred questions to
spokesman Gary Duberstein.
   Duberstein declined to discuss the matter with a reporter on
Thursday.
   The stock transfer comes at a time when other airlines have
sought cash infusions through the sales of various assets, and, in
the case of Eastern Airlines, persuading a bankruptcy court to
release millions of dollars from an escrow account.
   The corporate statement said Trans World picked up a $30 million
profit from the transfer, with the shares priced at Wednesday's
close of $30.75, and it still retains an interest in about 6.8
million shares of USX.
   Analysts said the airline was apparently putting its hands on
needed cash after being hit hard by the rise in fuel costs brought
on by the Persian Gulf crisis. Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait, TWA
has been hurt through recent years as competitors with stronger
domestic hubs have built up their service to foreign destinations,
chipping away at TWA's strong suit.
   That trend has also hurt Pan Am Corp., which along with Trans
World used to dominate overseas travel. Years ago, many passengers
flew however they could to New York, where they connected to Trans
World or Pan Am flights into Europe, but now many people fly the
competition directly from other cities to foreign points.
   ``The other carriers have moved those passengers from Trans
World and Pan Am to their own airlines flying out of interior
points,'' said George James, president of Airline Economics Inc., a
Washington-based aviation consulting firm.
   ``They have some serious cash flow problems as most of the
carriers who are in financial trouble have,'' James said.
   Airline analyst Raymond E. Neidl of Dillon Read &amp; Co. Inc.
agreed Trans World has probably started running low on cash just
before winter, traditionally the worst time of the year for
airlines.
   ``They're taking money out of one pocket and putting into
another,'' Neidl said. ``I think it's a wise move.''
   James estimated that higher fuel prices during the last five
months of the year will probably cost Trans World from $200 million
to $250 million. The increased costs come as demand for air travel
has tapered off.

<HEAD>Soviet Defense Industry Open to American Investors, Gorbachev Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `The Soviet ...,' with 3 new grafs to ADD
additional Gorbachev comments on possible defense industry
conversions. Also moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American investors are now welcome to invest
even in Soviet defense industries, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
said in an interview with a U.S. business magazine.
   The United States is lagging behind Germany but ranks ahead of
Japan in responding to investment possibilities in the Soviet
Union, Gorbachev told Fortune magazine in a Kremlin interview this
month.
   ``Long-term loans on favorable terms with payments after seven
years or more are particularly important now,'' Gorbachev said.
``But so is cooperation in modernizing factories in light industry,
in food processing, in electric power engineering and in the
defense industry.''
   With regard to defense industries, Gorbachev said, ``Of course,
the big problem is conversion (to civilian production). It's both
your problem and our problem. You have to find a way out, how to
use the potential of your defense industry, which is shrinking as a
result of the reduction in military contracts. For us, the problem
is even more acute. ... And it is good that we have begun
cooperating here, and we are exchanging our experiences about how
to convert.
   ``There are a lot of interesting projects.,'' Gorbachev added.
   Among long-term projects, he said, ``There is an idea for
cooperation among ourselves, the Americans and the Israelis to
(develop) a (commercial) passenger aircraft. These are all
large-scale projects. And there are many more.''
   He said Germans have been the most aggressive in their response,
``because the Germans know us better; especially now because of the
17 million former East Germans.''
   ``But there are many projects where there is a lot of room for
cooperation with American business,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``So far nothing has worked out with the Japanese,'' the Soviet
president said. ``They are waiting for permission from their
Foreign Ministry.''
   The Fortune interview is in the Dec. 31 issue of the fortnightly
magazine, which is due on newsstands Dec. 17.
   Gorbachev said he wants to speed up the convertibility of the
ruble into dollars and other hard currencies. ``We thought this
process would take a long time,'' he said, ``now we are cutting it
shorter. Otherwise it will be difficult for us to carry out our
economic cooperation.''
   ``The biggest difficulty today,'' Gorbachev said, ``is the
instability of the (consumer) market. The first thing to be done is
to tie up the mass of `hot money' or `crazy money.' ... More is
being produced than before. But on the other hand there is nothing
on the shelves. And the situation becomes panicky.''
   Gorbachev complained about U.S. congressional limitations on
trade such as those in the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the 1974 U.S.
Trade Act, which deprived the Soviet Union of most-favored-nation
status because of Soviet immigration and travel restrictions. ``We
have the status of a most-unfavored nation,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, several days after the Fortune interview,
President Bush waived some aspects of the Jackson-Vanik amendment
in order to provide the Soviet Union up to $1 billion in food aid.

<HEAD>It's Cheaper to Fill Up the Gas Tank in McAllen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>McALLEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At gasoline stations in this South Texas
city, it's as if Iraq never invaded Kuwait.
   Motorists filling up their gas tanks in McAllen pay about 25
cents less per gallon than most other Texans, and about 29 cents
less than most Americans.
   The most common price for regular unleaded was about $1.11 per
gallon on Thursday, but some prices were as low as $1.089 per
gallon.
   Prices in McAllen are about where they were at the time of the
Kuwait invasion on Aug. 2, which sent the price of crude oil and
gasoline skyrocketing.
   Crude prices have fallen lately, but the recent drops generally
have not shown up at gas pumps, in part because of a 5
cent-per-gallon federal deficit-reduction tax that took effect this
month.
   The prevailing price for regular unleaded statewide Thursday was
about $1.34 per gallon, according to the American Automobile
Association. Nationwide, the price averaged about $1.38 as of
Tuesday, according to the most recent AAA survey.
   Angry service station operators in McAllen say they're barely
getting by, and they blame Mayor Othal Brand Sr.
   His produce company, Griffin and Brand of McAllen Inc., manages
the United Farmers Co-Op gasoline pumps on North 23rd Street. For
about two years, the cooperative station has sold its gasoline to
the public at a lower profit margin than most stations.
   Rivals have had to keep their prices low to stay competitive.
   The mayor's son, Othal Brand Jr., executive vice president of
Griffin and Brand, said Thursday his gasoline suppliers were
selling the fuel for 22 cents less than a month ago.
   The station sells the gasoline for the same profit margin,
passing on the lower wholesale price to the consumer, he said.
   ``Whatever I'm buying it for, I'm marking it up the same as I
was a month ago,'' Brand said. He declined to reveal the station's
profit per gallon.
   Malcolm Welch Sr., president of Valley Shamrock Inc., a local
gasoline distributor, said the cooperative station doesn't have the
expenses of dealers who depend on gasoline sales.
   ``The poor, one-dealer stations are really suffering,'' Welch
said. ``They can't pay their rent, they can't pay their lights,
because of the low prices.''

   The Edward W. Scripps Trust, the controlling
shareholder of The E.W. Scripps Co., said Thursday it will sell 2
million shares of Class A common stock to the company for $31.5
million.
   The sale is a result of a decision by officers of the trust to
diversify the trust estate, the company said.
   Following the sale, the trust will own about 75 percent of the
Scripps Class A common stock and about 79 percent of the Scripps
common voting stock.
   Terms of the trust require trustees to retain enough stock to
ensure control of the company until final disposition of the
estate, the company said.
   Donald E. Melhaus, secretary of the trust, said administrators
could determine to sell additional shares from time to time.
   The E.W. Scripps Co. is a diversified media company that
operates 19 daily newspapers, nine television stations, five radio
stations, and cable television systems with 608,100 basic
subscribers. It also syndicates news features and comics worldwide.

   Farmers will be permitted to enter 1990-crop
wheat in a ``farmer-owned reserve'' storage program to help keep
surplus grain off the market and bolster market prices, Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Thursday.
   Under the ``FOR'' program, participating farmers can collect
government storage payments in return for locking their grain off
the market under the government's price-support loan apparatus
until prices rise high enough to trigger its release.
   The storage payments are made at the rate of 26.5 cents per
bushel annually, and the wheat in FOR storage cannot exceed 300
million bushels.
   Yeutter said wheat market prices had declined enough to make
1990 wheat eligible for the FOR program. He said farmers can obtain
additional information from local offices of the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service.

<HEAD>Anti-Tobacco, Anti-Alcohol Bill Becomes Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French Senate on Thursday voted into law
measures that will raise the price of cigarettes and place strict
curbs advertisements for tobacco and alcoholic beverages.
   The law, approved by an 181-96 vote, forbids all forms of direct
or indirect tobacco advertising beginning Jan. 1, 1993, orders
hikes in the price of cigarettes and removes cigarettes from the
list of products used to calculate the consumers' price index.
   It is less severe on alcohol, taking into account the concerns
of legislators from wine-growing regions who forced the rejection
in October of stiffer measures in another version of the bill.
   The new law permits alcohol advertising in wine-producing
regions, in the written press aimed at adults and in certain radio
broadcasts.
   The law forbids sponsorship of alcoholic beverages or tobacco by
companies in sports or other events.
   Jean-Marie Balestre, president of the International Federation
of Auto Sports, objected to the measures, saying there are ``other
much more dangerous scourges, like drugs.''
   Auto racing is among the sports that depends heavily on such
sponsorship.
   But Health Minister Claude Evin has said the law is necessary to
lower consumption of cigarettes and alcohol by French youths and
has praised the success of anti-smoking campaigns in the United
States.

<HEAD>Mary Kay May Have to Sell Part of Avon Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mary Kay Corp., one of three partners in an
investment group holding a sizeable stake in Avon Products Inc.,
said Thursday it may have to sell a portion of its Avon holdings.
   According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Dallas-based Mary Kay Corp. said it is involved in a
tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service.
   Mary Kay said the dispute may cause a subsidiary to liquidate a
portion of its holdings in Avon. That subsidiary, Argonaut Partners
L.P., is a member of Chartwell Associates, an investment group that
holds a 19.8 percent stake in Avon.
   Other members of Chartwell include the Gordon P. Getty Family
Trust and the Fisher real estate family of New York.
   In the SEC filing, however, the parent of door-to-door marketer
Mary Kay Cosmetics said it ``does not believe that the outcome of
such a dispute, which is currently scheduled to be heard in April
1991, will cause any such liquidation.''
   The filing did not give any further details of the tax dispute.
   A spokesman for May Kay in Dallas was not available for comment
late Thursday. A spokesman for Avon in New York said he had not
seen the filing and could not comment on it.

   President Bush approved the sale of
supercomputers and other high technology exports to Brazil, India
and China Thursday night but ordered new safeguards to ensure the
computers are not used for military purposes.
   The White House said Bush had ordered new controls on how export
licenses are granted for the sensitive, advanced technology
equipment.
   The White House refused to provide details of which specific
licenses had been granted, how much the contracts are for, and what
computers are going to each country.
   But an administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Bush had ruled on a series of eight applications,
and ``most of them were approved.'' He would not specify how many
were turned down.
   Bush announced last week in Brazil that he was approving an
export license for a supercomputer for the Embraer Aircraft Corp.
in Brazil. He cited that country's recent pact with Argentina
forswearing nuclear weapons as the reason for his approval.
   The Commerce Department will notify the companies starting
Friday which contracts have been approved and which rejected. The
administration refused to divulge other details, saying the
information was considered proprietary to the companies involved.
   Decisions on these export license had been ``held up due to
interagency differences and debate'' over whether to allow the
advanced technology exports.
   In a written statement, White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said, ``The president approved several of the license
applications, but because of the potential strategic applications
of such computers, he also required the imposition of stringent
safeguards to ensure that the computers will be used exclusively
for peaceful civilian purposes.''
   Fitzwater said Bush had put in place ``a package of procedural
reforms to streamline and clarify export license processing, while
enhancing our export controls to stem the spread of missile
technology and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.''
   He said the license applications from Brazil, India and China
all ``had raised a number of national security concerns.''
   Bush's initiative includes:
   -Worldwide export controls on 50 chemicals that can be used to
manufacture chemical weapons.
   -Export licenses for proposed exports that may be used in
developing missiles or chemical and biological weapons.
   -Civil and criminal penalties against U.S. citizens who
participate in activities that promote the spread of missile
technology and chemical weapons. Such penalties already apply to
the spread of nuclear and biological weapons.
   Bush ordered Commerce and other agencies to institute new
procedures by Jan. 1 to make so-called dual-use licensing decisions
faster and more predictable, while still meeting concerns about
proliferation and other national security issues.
   Dual-use technology has both civilian and military applications.
   Fitzwater quoted Bush as determining that ``American exporters
are entitled to prompt review of export license applications'' and
that there is ``a presumption of approval of such applications
based on our commitment to an open international trading system and
the need to ensure American competitiveness.''
   The Commerce Department is in the business of spurring American
exports, and at times has found itself at loggerheads with the
Pentagon and other defense agencies over sales of supercomputers
and other high tech exports.
   Commerce handles all applications for commodities and
technologies with civilian and military applications. Currently,
national security controls apply to exports destined for the Warsaw
Pact, China and certain other countries. Foreign policy controls
apply to exports for broader purposes, and are intended to prevent
proliferation of nuclear weapons, missile technology and chemical
or biological weapons.
   Bush now has ordered the foreign policy control cases to be
subject to the same reviews as the national security control cases.

   Walt Disney Co. and Jim Henson Productions
broke off talks Thursday after failing to reach an agreement on
Disney's plans to acquire rights to Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and
the other Muppet characters.
   The proposed deal to acquire Henson Associates Inc. was valued
at $100 million to $150 million. Disney also had sought an
exclusive production agreement with Jim Henson Productions in the
talks, which began in August 1989.
   ``We truly regret we could not come to terms,'' Disney Chairman
and Chief Executive Michael D. Eisner said in a statement.
   Erwin Okun, a senior Disney vice president, said it was too
early to tell whether the failed acquisition would preclude Disney
and Henson Productions from launching future joint productions.
However, he noted that statements issued by both companies were
cordial.
   ``We have great admiration for Jim and respect for the Henson
people, the family, who we've gotten to know pretty well,'' Okun
said.
   The Henson family, which has owned Henson Productions since the
puppeteer's death in May, said current projects with Disney would
not be affected.
   Those projects include a Disney Channel television series ``Jim
Henson's Mother Goose,'' a situation comedy series involving
dinosaurs, which is scheduled to air in January on ABC, and a 3-D
film that will be shown to visitors to Walt Disney World in
Florida.
   ``We would have liked to see this deal succeed,'' the Henson
family said in a news release. ``Unfortunately, after 18 months of
negotiating, the companies could ot reach a mutually satisfactory
agreement.''
   Henson, who died May 18, founded his production company in 1958
as Muppets Inc. to produce all his properties.
   Recent negotiations had centered around the lower price Disney
offered after Henson death.
   Analysts had speculated that his passing would lessen the value
of the acquisition. Henson's personal talents formed part of
Eisner's original strategy to cross-market Muppet characters such
as Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy with Disney creations.
   Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Crowell Weedon &amp; Co., said it
was more likely that Disney was scared off by hefty estate taxes
owed on Henson properties.
   ``There were enormous estate tax problems. From what I have
heard that was a major area that was problematic,'' Logsdon said.
``It gets down to them asking, `What are we really getting as a
return, what kind of money will we be making?.'''
   In losing the deal, Disney lost the opportunity to combine two
sets of highly loved and highly marketable characters, Logsdon
said.
   ``It gave Disney a whole new range of characters to utilize in
their theme parks and entertainment projects,'' Logsdon said.
   Disney reached an agreement in principle with Henson only weeks
after negotiations began last year. The deal called for Henson to
operate a Los Angeles production company under the Disney umbrella.
   Except for Kermit the Frog, Disney was not to receive rights to
Muppet characters that appear regularly on Sesame Street. Those
characters are owned in part by the show's producer, Children's
Television Workshop.

   The latest freebie program to hit the sagging
airline industry began spreading Thursday as American, United and
Northwest scrambled to match a promotion launched two days earlier
by Delta.
   Now, four relatively strong players in the otherwise stumbling
industry are offering passengers who complete eight ``segments'' of
air travel a free flight to be taken next year.
   When Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines began the latest battle by
launching an earlier-than-usual winter special, analysts said it
appeared to be escalating the general fare war and applying direct
pressure to a struggling rival, Eastern Airlines.
   Delta's offer this week of free tickets or first-class upgrades
to passengers who fly as few as two round-trip excursions comes
earlier than the traditional sales offered by airlines during their
slow winter season.
   After Delta announced its promotion on Tuesday, it was followed
Thursday by a similar freebie plan unveiled by American Airlines,
which claimed its deal made it easier for some passengers to obtain
a free trip.
   Hours later, United Airlines chimed in with its own freebie
plan.
   And Northwest Airlines entered the fray with a plan that offers
free tickets for flying three roundtrips. The Minnesota-based
carrier boasts that it is the only airline to include free travel
to Europe and Hawaii.
   Analysts had been somewhat surprised to see the latest fare
battle begin with Delta, which usually follows other carriers in
pricing decisions. It apparently decided to become a leader by
starting the special before the crowds of holiday travelers have
even come and gone.
   ``It looks like it's happened a little bit earlier now, which is
telling me bookings are a little bit softer than expected,'' said
Raymond E. Neidl, an airline analyst with the investment firm
Dillon Read &amp; Co. Inc.
   Airlines are limping toward their biggest annual losses ever,
largely because of high fuel costs and a slumping economy that has
weakened demand for air travel. Industry experts have said the
outlook for 1991 is gloomy as well, with available seats
outstripping demand.
   Delta acknowledged slower-than-desirable bookings was part of
its motivation for offering the freebies to frequent fliers who
complete eight ``segments'' between Dec. 15 and March 15. A segment
is defined as each flight with a different number, so trips with
connections can include several segments.
   Two round trips that include connections each way would qualify
for the freebies, which can be cashed in later next year.
   The American plan also offers free trips for people who fly
eight segments or three round trips, whichevercomes first.
American's plan does not include first-class upgrades, because its
frequent flyers already have plenty of opportunities for them,
spokesman Tim Smith said.
   United's plan offers a free trip for customers who fly eight
segments or three round trips and was announced in response to the
moves by its rivals, spokeswoman Sara Dornacker said.
   The Delta bonus was announced five days after rival Eastern
Airlines made a similar move. The Eastern program offers a weekend
ticket for $91 to anyone who makes a single round trip at a
``corporate rate'' fare during December or January.
   Delta spokesman Neil Monroe said he mentioned the Eastern
program only reluctantly, because Delta views its program as a
systemwide deal designed to beat the competition in many markets.
   Some analysts, however, saw the Delta move as a direct threat to
Eastern, which is struggling to stay alive with a recent $135
million cash infusion granted by a bankruptcy judge.
   ``It's a competitive necessity that Delta keep Eastern on the
mat, so to speak,'' said Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst with
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. ``I think this time the bankruptcy court has
gone as low in the till as they're going to go.''
   Delta said the promotion may not cost it much money, because
most frequent fliers are expected to take first-class upgrades
instead of free trips. Delta will limit the number of seats
available on each flight for passengers who choose the free travel,
Monroe said.
   Still, analysts said the competition would be pressured to come
up with something similar before too long, and it didn't take
American too long to respond.
   Some analysts warned that Delta's promotion could be countered
by promotions that offer fliers an even better deal, which would
enhance the risk that airlines will do further damage to their
already-weak earnings.
   ``I would think all of the large carriers will find it desirable
to remain competitive with Delta, so they'll come up with the same
or something similiar,'' said Robert J. Joedicke, an advisory
director who follows airlines for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   ``The big worry is that someone will come out with something
broader,'' Neidl said.
