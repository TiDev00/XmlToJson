   The family of a teen-ager convicted of
beating his dog with a plank dropped their bid to retain custody of
the animal after animal rights activists flooded a court with
protest letters.
   Applause broke out in the Lowell District Court Friday when
lawyer F. Andrew Turley said the family of owner Kevin Deschene had
decided to drop their claim to 19-month-old Champ, a German
shepherd-collie.
   More than 21,000 signatures were brought to the court demanding
the family be denied custody because of photographs a neighbor took
in November that showed Deschene beating Champ with a 4-foot wooden
plank.
   Deschene, 19, was sentenced last month to a year in prison for a
misdemeanor complaint of cruelty to animals. Six months of the
conviction were suspended.
   The photographs by neighbor Jim Molloy were widely publicized.
   Deschene said he was disciplining Champ for tearing up garbage.
   ``This was a very difficult time for Kevin and the family,''
Turley said after the hearing Friday. ``They had Champ for eight or
nine months. They loved that dog.''
   Kim Deschene, Kevin's sister, was arrested after Friday's
hearing for alleged witness intimidation against Molloy, said
Lowell Police Sgt. Steven Smith.
   Barbara Deschene, Kevin's mother, also was arrested Friday _ on
an unrelated charge of alleged larceny in a welfare fraud, Smith
said.
   Allan Davidson, the executive director of the Lowell Humane
Society who has been caring for Champ since Nov. 28, said his
office had received more than 3,700 letters from people across the
country asking that Champ not be returned to the Deschene family.
   ``Even Doris Day sent a telegram the day before yesterday asking
us to keep the dog away from the family and put him in a loving
home,'' Davidson said. Day is an active animal rights campaigner.
   ``The new home will provide him with the love and care he
needs,'' Davidson said. He would not disclose where the dog's new
home, saying he feared reprisals from the Deschene family.
   Esther Nowell, president of Protection of Animals in Wakefield
Society, or PAWS, was one of the many animal rights activists who
attended the hearing.
   ``I feel that justice has been done,'' Ms. Nowell said.``For the
first time in my memory a man has gone to jail and is having to
actually serve time for cruelty to animals. Then he's says he wants
the dog back? It's not right.''
   Turley said the family dropped the custody battle because they
were afraid that when they got Champ back in their home, ``the
circus would never end.''
   ``They want to get on with their lives,'' Turley said.
   Wounds on Champ's head and thighs have healed, but the
psychological effects will be with him for the rest of his life,
Davidson said.

   Greece recalled its ambassador from
Albania after accusing that country's security officials of
pursuing an asylum seeker into the Greek embassy, beating him, and
dragging him away.
   Greek officials say armed Albanian security officials moved into
embassy in Tirana, the Albanian capital, on Sunday. They say the
officials beat the asylum seeker and took him away.
   Ambassador Spyros Dokianos was recalled to Athens on Friday for
consultations, said government spokesman Vyron Polydoras.
   Relations between the two neighboring Balkan countries have been
tense since late last year. Greece says an ethnic Greek minority is
mistreated in Albania, Europe's last hard-line Communist nation.
   Albania has an ethnic Greek minority of about 250,000 in a
population of more than 3 million. Religious worship is forbidden
and attempts to flee the country are punished severely.

   A leading opposition group has
endorsed President Vaclav Havel for re-election in a parliamentary
vote next month, the state news agency said.
   Jan Urban, leader of the opposition Civic Forum, announced his
group's support, the CTK news agency reported Friday.
   Havel, a dissident playwright who had been jailed by the
country's former Communist authorities, was elected president in
December in the wake of democratic reforms.
   At the time, Havel said he would accept the presidency only
temporarily until a new president was chosen by a freely elected
parliament. Sources close to Havel now say he may want to continue
as president after the June elections, but for no longer than two
years.
   Parliament on Wednesday approved a two-year term for the next
president to match the terms of lawmakers.

   Prosecutors said the light sentence given
a computer hacker whose ``worm'' shut down a nationwide network
would not deter them from cracking down on computer abuse.
   Robert T. Morris Jr., 25, was sentenced Friday to three years
probation, fined $10,000 and ordered to perform 400 hours community
service.
   Although the Justice Department had asked that Morris be given
jail time, U.S. Attorney Frederick Scullin Jr. said he believed the
sentence was fair.
   ``This is sort of a unique circumstance,'' he said. ``I don't
feel it's going to be any sort of a precedent.''
   Scullin said future computer hackers may face stricter sentences.
   ``Would-be hackers are now on notice that the Department of
Justice will vigorously prosecute future computer criminals and
seek severe penalties, regardless of what their motives are,'' he
said.
   U.S. District Judge Howard Munson said there were no previous
cases that could be used as a model for sentencing.
   In January, Morris became the first person to be convicted under
the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for breaking into a federal
computer network and preventing authorized use of the system.
   The former Cornell University graduate student was found guilty
of creating a ``worm'' program on Nov. 2, 1988 that invaded an
estimated 6,000 computers linked to the Internet research system
used at NASA, military facilities and major universities.
   Once in the system, the program replicated itself wildly,
paralyzing the network.
   Under federal sentencing guidelines, Morris faced up to five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine. But his attorneys argued that
the case did not fit the guidelines.
   ``This is not your garden-variety fraud crime,'' attorney David
O'Brien said. ``This crime was not motivated by malice. It was not
motivated by an intention to do harm. It was an experiment _ albeit
a reckless, irresponsible, stupid one.''
   Defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni said the sentence was
reasonable, but he will file an appeal to challenge the law under
which Morris was convicted.
   ``I don't believe Mr. Morris deserves to be a felon for what he
did,'' Guidoboni said.
   Morris did not speak at the sentencing and did not talk to
reporters afterward. When the sentence was announced, he smiled and
hugged his mother.
   Robert Morris Sr., a scientist at the National Computer Security
Center in Bethesda, Md., said he does not consider his son a
criminal.
   ``There is real computer crime in this country,'' he said. ``It
is rampant and extremely expensive, and this case did not begin to
touch on that.''
   Morris, who was suspended from Cornell after the worm incident,
works at a computer-related job in Cambridge, Mass.
   He testified at his trial that the worm was an experiment that
went out of control because of a programming error he made. He
admitted he designed the worm to attack the Internet system but
said it wasn't supposed to replicate as it did.
   Prosecutors described his program as a ``full-scale assault''
and said Morris took deliberate steps to make the worm difficult to
trace and eradicate.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Leader Says Western Support Crucial for Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene
says a strong declaration of support by Western nations could be
decisive in bringing the Baltic republics independence from the
Soviet Union.
   Mrs. Prunskiene's two-day, non-stop crusade for Lithuanian
independence at the White House, State Department and on Capitol
Hill resulted in an inconclusive session with President Bush.
   But she said Friday that she continues to hope that Bush and
other world leaders can yet be persuaded that embracing
independence for Lithuania and its neighbors Latvia and Estonia
will not undermine Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his
program of political and economic reform.
   She said the reluctance of Western nations to recognize an
independent Lithuania now is ``the main factor'' in the Soviets'
refusal to accept her republic's secession as an accomplished fact.
   Mrs. Prunskiene will meet with British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher in London on Tuesday and is expected to use the occasion
to appeal once more for Western guarantees of Lithuanian
sovereignty.
   Such guarantees are essential, she said, for Lithuanian
participation in any compromise calling for the temporary
suspension of independence laws.
   Mrs. Prunskiene's last scheduled appearance in the United States
was an address today to the Lithuanian Youth Association here.
   Speaking on Friday at the National Press Club, the Lithuanian
leader said the summit between Bush and Gorbachev opening here on
May 30 offers a crucial opportunity to cement Baltic independence.
   That would end a chapter begun 50 years ago when the Soviet
Union forcibly annexed Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia after striking
a secret deal with Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler.
   But Mrs. Prunskiene said the United States and the West must act
more decisively than they have to date if that is to become a
reality.
   She said Western guarantees are needed because merely urging
good-faith negotiations with Moscow is no answer to her republic's
insistence on eventual true independence.
   ``Simply making statements that there should be cooperation is
not adequate at this time when the Soviets are interfering in
Lithuania's ties with other countries,'' Mrs. Prunskiene said.
   She appealed to Bush to withhold the preferred trade and tariff
status the Soviets have eagerly sought as an opening to the world's
markets.
   Granting ``most favored nation'' preferences while the Soviets
are tightening their economic blockade of Lithuania ``would be
providing implicit support for their actions.'' she said.
   But in a policy shift, Mrs. Prunskiene dropped demands for the
immediate imposition of retaliatory U.S. economic sanctions against
the Kremlin, possibly out of concern that step might anger
Lithuania's supporters among the Soviet Union's emerging
pro-democracy forces.
   ``We would hope the imposition of economic sanctions would be
held in reserve as a threat to our eventually sitting down at the
negotiating table, because we are not looking for a situation where
the Soviet people are forced to suffer,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 17,000 new cases of AIDS were registered in
April, raising the number of victims reported worldwide to 254,078,
the World Health Organization said.
   In the report released Friday, Uganda told the U.N. agency last
month that 12,444 AIDS cases had occurred by the end of December,
compared with 7,375 in April 1989.
   The new figures mean Uganda replaces its central African
neighbor Zaire as the second worst affected country worldwide.
Zaire reported 11,732 cases by the end of January.
   The United States reported 126,127 cases of the deadly disease,
nearly half the official international total and up 1,945 from
March.
   In South America, Brazil reported the highest total. It
registered 10,510 cases as of March, up from 9,555 in December.
   AIDS, caused by a virus that attacks the immune system, is
spread mainly by sexual contact, the use of contaminated needles
among drug abusers, and blood transfusions.

<HEAD>President Says Some Nuclear Weapons Still Needed in Europe</HEAD>

   President Bush says that even as he
slashes new missile systems and negotiates with the Soviets to
reduce others, nuclear weapons are still needed in Europe.
   ``Only the combination of conventional forces and nuclear forces
have insured peace in Europe,'' he said Friday in the first of a
series of commencement speeches he will make on the changing
geopolitical face of the world.
   Bush said that in addition to scrapping upgraded Lance missiles
in Europe, he wants to begin talks with the Soviets to reduce other
short-range missiles shortly after signing a treaty on reducing
conventional forces next fall.
   Nonetheless, he said, ``The United States is not going to allow
Europe to become `safe for conventional war.'''
   Thus, the nuclear component must remain to protect Europe in
concert with conventional elements such as troops and tanks, he
said.
   A senior administration official, briefing reporters on Air
Force One under condition of anonymity, said, ``We think there
needs to be some nuclear weapons in Europe. Deterrence has to have
a nuclear component.''
   Bush said the 16 North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries,
meeting in late June or early July, should outline ``the minimum
number and types of weapons that will be needed to deter war,
credibly and effectively.''
   He said ``militarily significant'' U.S. forces would remain in
Europe, where some 300,000 now are stationed.
   In the address at Oklahoma State University, the president
elaborated on his call for the NATO summit to completely review the
alliance's mission, both military and political, in light of the
dramatic democratic reforms in the Warsaw Pact countries.
   Bush later flew to Tulsa and spoke to the Oklahoma Foundation
for Excellence, which honored 100 outstanding high school seniors.
He also attended a Republican fund-raising reception.
   The president's recent acknowledgment that he hates broccoli was
well noted on the Oklahoma stop.
   At the airport, a child held a large hand-drawn poster of Bush
in a boxing ring standing triumphantly over a felled broccoli
opponent. ``Bush beats broccoli,'' the poster said. The president
autographed it for the child.
   Later he joked that someone in the graduation crowd had a sign
reading, ``George, eat your broccoli.''
   ``I don't need advice from little kids on what I eat,'' he
exclaimed.
   Bush flew Friday night to Camp David, Md., and returns to the
White House on Sunday for budget talks with congressional leaders.
   The meeting comes after a week that saw the Senate Budget
Committee and the House adopt separate, Democratic-written budgets
for next year. Each one strips nearly $10 billion from Bush's own
military spending proposal for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   The budget itself does not require Bush's signature, but he must
sign separate bills that finance programs or raise and lower taxes.
   Administration officials and Republican lawmakers have been
pressing all year for budget negotiations.

   The skipper of the USS Iowa fired a
departing salvo at the Navy, saying it had mishandled a probe into
the gun turret explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard his ship
last year.
   Facing the guns of the battleship where the sailors died on
April 19, 1989, Capt. Fred P. Moosally said at his retirement
ceremony Friday the men who handled the report were more interested
in the Navy's image than the good of the crew.
   Moosally said the investigation was handled by people who used
``facts and opinions based on unsubstantiated third-party
information, unsubstantiated reports and supposition.''
   The Navy's investigation concluded sabotage by Gunner's Mate
Clayton Hartwig caused the blast. It said Hartwig, who died in the
blast, was disgruntled and suicidal about how the Navy had treated
him for promotion and assignments.
   ``People who in their rush to manage the Iowa problem forgot
about doing the right thing for the Iowa crew,'' said Moosally, a
24-year veteran.
   ``The explosion ... was a dual tragedy. Forty-seven men died and
1,500 survivors were made victims when they should have been
heros,'' Moosally said.
   Moosally had previously been tight-lipped about the six-month
Navy investigation of the explosion that sent a deadly fireball
running inside turret No. 2. At the end of the ceremony he was
awarded the Legion of Merit for leadership aboard the Iowa
following the explosion.
   Moosally's word were soothing to some of the relatives of the
dead sailors.
   ``I've been waiting for this day, because I was hoping and
praying that the man will really speak his mind about the
accident,'' Kathy Kubicina, Hartwig's sister, said in a telephone
interview from her home in Cleveland, Ohio.
   Ms. Kubicina and other families have been fighting to get the
Navy to reopen its investigation. Two congressional inquiries have
reviewed the report, which several members of Congress have said is
flawed.
   ``This is just great news. For the captain of the ship to say it
was inadequate, that really tells a lot,'' said Ms. Kubicina.
   A Navy spokesman in Washington, Lt. Mark Walker, said Moosally's
criticism of the investigation was his personal opinion. ``The
investigating officer, Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, and his team
were extremely thorough and professional throughout the
investigation.''
   Walker said Milligan's conclusions were reached ``after an
intense methodical investigation during which the Navy conducted
more than 20,000 technical tests that ruled out possible accidental
causes.''
   John Hague, whose stepson, Philip Buch, died in the explosion,
has defended the Navy's report in the past. But he agreed with
Moosally the Iowa crew had been slighted.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that those men are heroes,'' he
said from his home in La Mesa, N.M.
   Nancy Lewis of Northville, Mich., whose son, Richard, was killed
in the explosion, said Moosally ``has joined the ranks of many of
the rest of us on how the report was handled. .. Maybe the Navy is
trying to do the right thing.''
   Moosally, a 1966 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, was
succeeded by his executive officer, Cmdr. John P. Morse. The
battleship is expected to be decommissioned and put in mothballs
later this year.

<HEAD>Labor Praises Naming of Presidential Emergency Board</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's appointment of an emergency
board to help resolve a labor dispute over rising health care costs
in the railroad industry is winning praise from labor leaders.
   The board is needed to head off a ``crippling nationwide rail
strike,'' the White House said Friday in naming a panel to help
settle bargaining disputes between 11 unions and the nation's major
railroads.
   Negotiators have been trying to reach a contract for two years,
but rising health care costs for 300,000 workers remain an obstacle.
   A few months ago, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole appointed a
commission to study health care costs within the coal industry, a
key issue in last year's bitter Pittston strike.
   Dick Kilroy, chairman of the Cooperating Railway Labor
Organizations, which represents the 11 unions, said health care
costs in the railroad industry have been rising between 15 percent
and 20 percent a year, and were expected to continue on that path
for another five years.
   ``It's an issue that really doesn't belong on the bargaining
table,'' Kilroy said.
   Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO, called Bush's action
``very encouraging'' because, with Pittston, it was ``the second
recognition of the overwhelming problem.''
   Both sides in the dispute had expected the White House to
appoint the board, an action that in effect provides a 60-day
cooling-off period before any strike can occur.
   Bush was criticized by labor leaders last year when he declined
to appoint an emergency board in the strike by machinists at
Eastern Airlines. That was the first time, to the National
Mediation Board's knowledge, that a president had not acted once
the board notified him of a potential emergency within the
transportation industry.
   Bush created the three-member railroad board under authority
given him by the Railway Labor Act.
   Under that law, labor contracts stay in force during
negotiations, essentially postponing their expiration indefinitely.
If the two sides reach an impasse in their talks, other provisions
of the law trigger various forms of government intervention leading
up to the creation of an emergency board, if the president decides
to appoint one.
   Administration officials said the railroad impasse differs from
the airline strike. Both sides in the railroad dispute were seeking
White House help, they said, but Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent
company, did not want an emergency board named in that dispute.
   In addition, the Eastern walkout has disrupted only a portion of
the airline industry while a railroad strike would affect the
entire nation.
   A White House statement said the railroad dispute ``threatens
substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as
to deprive various sections of the country of essential
transportation service.''
   ``The Department of Transportation has advised that the
railroads move over one-third of all intercity freight traffic,
which involves goods valued at more than $1 billion each day,'' the
statement said.
   A rail strike, besides idling railroad workers and stranding
riders, could cause more than 500,000 layoffs within two weeks in
industries served by railroads, the White House said.
   ``The direct costs of a strike could be at least $16 million per
day, and the indirect economic costs could be much higher,'' it
said.
   The members of the emergency board are Robert O. Harris of
Washington, ombudsman for the International Monetary Fund, who will
serve as chairman; and labor arbitrators Richard R. Kasher of Bryn
Mawr, Pa., and Arthur Stark of New York.

   The United States and its major trading
partners are proclaiming progress in an ambitious effort to
overhaul the global trading system while also conceding that
serious obstacles remain.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and her counterparts from
Japan, the 12-nation European Community and Canada said Friday that
they had been able to better define the differences that exist
between them during three days of talks at a posh resort in
California wine country.
   Japanese Trade Minister Kabun Muto called the discussions
``frank and useful.'' Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said he
believed they had been successful in ``turning the heat up'' to
provide momentum toward an agreement.
   But the officials conceded there had been no major breakthroughs
in the discussions and that such contentious issues as agricultural
subsidies and barriers to trade in textiles remained far from
settled.
   Global trade talks, being conducted through the 97-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, were launched at a
conference in Uruguay in 1986 and are scheduled to conclude this
December.
   The Bush administration is counting on a successful outcome to
boost sales by American businesses and farmers and thus lower the
huge U.S. trade deficit.
   Specifically, it is seeking agreement to phase out within 10
years costly farm subsidies, to broaden GATT rules to include
service industries such as banking and insurance and to strengthen
protection against copyright piracy, which costs American companies
$60 billion annually.
   But the European Community, seeking to protect its network of
small farms, is fighting the effort to slash farm subsidies while
Third World nations oppose lowering barriers for service
industries, contending that they need to protect fledgling domestic
businesses.
   Hills said she was still hopeful that the differences can be
resolved. She said she expected an outline of a final agreement to
be completed during a negotiating session in late July.
   With time running out on the four-year effort to reform the
global trading system, Hills said the negotiators would appeal to
President Bush and other leaders at the July summit of seven
industrialized nations to supply a ``political push'' to break the
stalemates.
   Still, without a decision by some countries to compromise, the
final outcome of the free-trade talks was uncertain.
   One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it
was likely the toughest issues would not be resolved until the
final bargaining session seven months from now in Brussels.
   ``Negotiations are a process of attrition,'' he said. ``It is
just in the nature of things with issues that are hard-fought.''
   Frans Andriessen, trade minister for the European Community,
said the wealthy nations needed to try harder to make the trade
package attractive to developing countries to ensure their support
in the final round of bargaining.
   If an agreement is reached, the administration must still
persuade Congress to accept the document.
   Already, U.S. special interests from textile manufacturers to
sugar and peanut growers are lining up congressional supporters to
oppose any trade agreement that results in a loss of trade
protections they now enjoy.

   The seized assets of Manuel Noriega include some of
$11 million he got from U.S. intelligence agencies, his lawyers
argued, while asking that the government be forced to release the
money so they can be paid.
   A federal judge Friday ordered the government to justify its
seizure of the deposed Panamanian leader's $20 million in assets,
which defense attorneys claim were earned legitimately.
   Noriega's lawyers argued during an hourlong hearing that they
cannot proceed without money from bank accounts frozen by the
government. They subpoenaed records from the CIA, Drug Enforcement
Administration and other agencies as a way to prove Noriega's
income was not from drug trafficking.
   Frank Rubino, Noriega's lead attorney, told U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler that U.S. intelligence agencies had paid Noriega
$11 million during his years in the Panamanian National Guard.
   ``I don't know if you can call money from the CIA tainted or
not, but it's certainly not drug money,'' Rubino said.
   Noriega was paid another $6 million or $7 million by foreign
governments, the defense claimed at the hearing, which was not
attended by Noriega.
   Noriega was indicted in Miami in February 1988 on charges of
taking money from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to make Panama a
safe haven for cocaine smuggling. He surrendered to U.S.
authorities Jan. 4, two weeks after U.S. troops invaded Panama.
   The judge appeared sympathetic to the defense's position that
the seizure of assets was unreasonable.
   ``It appears he must have acquired some assets of his own in his
20 years as an officer,'' Hoeveler said.
   The judge ordered the U.S. attorney's office to come up with a
list of Noriega's seized assets and justify their confiscation. He
also indicated he expected them to cooperate fully with the defense
subpoenas, which were served Thursday.
   Hoeveler said while Noriega clearly could not use ``ill-gotten
gains'' to pay his attorneys, the government could not arbitrarily
seize money without proving he had earned it through drug
trafficking or other illegal means.
   Rubino said at the hearing that $5.8 million confiscated by U.S.
troops in Noriega's quarters in Panama was given back to the
Panamanian government by the United States without informing
Noriega's lawyers. He said the government never established whether
that money was acquired illegally.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan said the government did
not object to making a list of the bank accounts. But he said all
the accounts, except one, were in foreign banks.
   ``Foreign governments will have some interest (in the money) and
their laws will prevail over those assets,'' Sullivan said.
   In court papers, Rubino said the government already has spent
$12 million and was prepared to spend $25 million more prosecuting
Noriega. Rubino said the defense has the right to use Noriega's
funds to hire more attorneys, investigators and secretaries.
   Sullivan responded with an affidavit from another prosecutor who
said Rubino told her he had received a retainer of ``seven
figures'' from Noriega. Rubino has acknowledged the comment but
said it was a joke.
   Rubino said attorneys learned ``the intelligence community is in
possession of evidence that completely exonerates General Noriega
as to a particular count of the indictment,'' but said the defense
lacks the money to pursue the lead.
   The prosecution says the money at issue is held in 27 bank
accounts.
   ``Only one of these accounts, located in Panama, is in the
defendant's name,'' a government motion said, adding investigators
are not even sure if it contains any money.
   Noriega is being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional
Center outside Miami.

   Since school rules said they couldn't wear
shorts, a few boys at a high school decided to protest. They wore
skirts.
   Principal Noel Long said no one was suspended or missed class
because of Thursday's protest.
   Darell Wilson, 17, said at least three boys wore skirts.
   ``I heard some students in a classroom guffawing'' at one male
student who wore a skirt over his pants, Long said.
   ``I told him if he insisted on disrupting the classroom I would
have to suspend him,'' Long said. The student removed the skirt.
   Student Corey Vann said Long made an announcement over the
intercom Thursday morning asking teachers to send boys wearing
skirts to the office.
   ``I think it's stupid,'' Vann said of the rule. ``Girls can wear
'em.''
   According to a school handbook, neither sex is allowed to wear
shorts.

<HEAD>Smoking Exports: Jeers from Critics, Cheers from Tobacco Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigarette opponents want the U.S. government
to end policies that they say help tobacco companies increase their
sales in Asia to offset declines in the United States.
   The United States was long admired for its lifesaving medical
advances, but ``now, because of the aggressive advertising of the
tobacco industry, we are acquiring a different reputation in the
Third World _ as exporters of disease and death,'' Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., told his Labor and Human Resources Committee on
Friday.
   Kennedy charged that the U.S. government ``has been an
accomplice ... threatening trade sanctions against countries which
restrict access to American cigarettes.''
   The senator's comments were the latest round in an escalating
conflict between the tobacco industry and critics who want to halt
government efforts to expand the foreign market for U.S. brand
cigarettes in the name of free trade.
   ``Free trade is not a license to export lung cancer or ride
roughshod over the anti-smoking laws of other nations,'' Kennedy
said.
   Walter D. Huddleston, a witness for the U.S. Cigarette Export
Association, countered that the issue is not health but trade and
jobs for American tobacco growers and workers.
   ``The same number of cigarettes are going to be smoked in
foreign countries regardless of whether American products are there
or not,'' he said. ``The only issue is who makes them ... who grows
the tobacco .... We are not exporting the practice of smoking.''
   But William Foege, former director of the Centers for Disease
Control, testified that ``when U.S. manufacturers enter a market in
a developing country, they not only bring cigarettes, they bring
marketing and advertising techniques far superior to those
existing.''
   Smoking is declining about 1 percent a year in advanced
countries but rising at least 2 percent in the Third World, Foege
said. He predicted that it would become the leading cause of death
in developing countries by the end of the decade, killing more
people annually than the 6 million believed slaughtered during the
entire Holocaust.
   The government's success in opening markets to U.S. cigarette
brands in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan and a current effort in
Thailand drew praise from witnesses representing the industry and
tobacco-growing states and in a letter from 120 House members
delivered earlier this week to U.S. trade representative Carla
Hills.
   Dr. Gregory Connolly, testifying for the American Cancer Society
and Heart and Lung Associations, said cigarette consumption was
declining in Japan until the market was opened to American
countries. It then rose 3 percent, while the increase in Taiwan was
4 percent, he said.
   In 1987, cigarettes rose from 40th to second place in total
Japanese television advertising time, heavily targeting women and
youths, Connolly said.
   Describing tobacco exports as ``a success story,'' industry
witnesses said tobacco was one of the few U.S. exports earning a
surplus last year, more than $4.2 billion, to help offset the $109
billion trade deficit.
   Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass., said hearings will be held later
this month on House legislation to bar the U.S. trade
representative from intervening on behalf of tobacco exports. The
bill also would require U.S. tobacco brands sold abroad to carry
the same health warnings as in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Thinking of buying a place to get away on
those hot summer weekends? How about a replica of an 18th century
French chateau or the mansion that once belonged to famed author
Edith Wharton?
   Real estate agents claim that an economic downturn in New
England property hasn't hit Newport's ritziest neighborhoods, where
up-for-sale mansions abound.
   ``There are some wonderful opportunities _ if you can afford
it,'' said Robin Corbin, owner of the real estate agency Private
Properties.
   Newport's Bellevue Avenue, known as Millionaires Row, has at
least three homes for sale and more than a dozen condominiums.
Other castle-like homes are listed in some of the less visible, but
perhaps more opulent, neighborhoods of this high-society city that
once hosted the America's Cup and is home to the Tennis Hall of
Fame.
   Jacqueline Cranwell of Gustave J.S. White Real Estate, an
affiliate of Sotheby's International Realty, said there is nothing
unusual about the number of Newport spreads listed.
   ``All the houses we have on the market are on for various
reasons, nothing to do with money problems,'' Cranwell said. ``It's
just the normal turnover.''
   The people who own dwellings of this sort aren't the kind
affected by seasonal turns of the economy, she said.
   ``If you have money, you have it,'' Cranwell said.
   But there is some evidence to the contrary.
   A four-bedroom, brick carriage house on 1\ acres was listed for
seven months at $2.8 million and sold only after the price was
lowered to $1.3 million, Cranwell said.
   And some who may be able to purchase estates only with financing
may not qualify in slower economic times, Corbin said.
   The Rhode Island Association of Realtors said the Northeast has
been the hardest hit area in a nationwide slump. In the first
quarter, Rhode Island home sales declined 8.5 percent from the same
period last year.
   In Newport, the median price for a single-family home dropped to
$140,000, compared to $159,000 a year ago.
   If you've got the money, the choices are impressive.
   Bellevue Avenue's Vernon Court, built in 1900 to resemble a
French chateau, is one of Newport's grandest homes. The asking
price? $2.6 million.
   A 52-foot-long entrance hall leads to the 15,000-square-foot
residence, with six bedrooms for the hosts and 10 for the servants.
Although the 3-acre estate is not on the waterfront, it has a
heated, 25-foot-by-50-foot swimming pool _ larger than most living
rooms.
   Within a 10-foot-high wall surrounding the yard are two tennis
courts and a garden copied from the ones Henry VIII built for Ann
Boylen at Hampton Court, Cranwell said.
   Also up for sale is Lands End on Ledge Road. It was built around
1870 and American novelist Edith Wharton bought the home about 20
years later.
   Wharton renovated the home with architect Ogden Codman, with
whom she wrote the book, ``On the Decoration of Houses,'' one of
the first on interior design, Corbin said.
   The stucco, waterfront home has 10 bedrooms, 5{ acres of land
and is ``very typically Ogden Codman,'' who was a colonial
revivalist, he said. It's listed for $2.7 million.
   If your tastes run to gardens, and you have $4.25 million,
Wildacre on Ocean Drive might be for you. Its Japanese gardens were
designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, who laid out New York City's
Central Park.
   Castle Hill mansion has been on the market for about 1{ years.
It's listed at $20 million.
   The 10,000-square-foot home is set on a 40-acre peninsula with
more than 7,000 feet of water frontage and a private dock for 20
boats, Cranwell said.
   The home, built in 1875, is being used as a restaurant and guest
house, but its 10 bedrooms could be converted back to a
single-family home, she said.
   In all, Newport has about 200 mansions in private ownership
today, said a spokeswoman for the Newport Preservation Society who
would not give her name.
   At the turn of the century there were about 400 18th- and
19th-century mansions in Newport, but many have been lost do to
acts of man and nature, the spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Defense Cost-Cutting Measures Include Cutting Back B-2 Flight Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Strategic Air Command says B-2
stealth bomber pilots may fly the radar-evading aircraft only twice
a month to hold down expenses.
   ``I realize how expensive this plane is. ... We plan to fly it
twice a month under special circumstances,'' Gen. John T. Chain Jr.
told reporters.
   Budget pressures were the primary impetus behind Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney's recent decision to buy only 75 of the
bat-winged aircraft instead of the 132 planned, Chain said.
   ``If weren't for the budget driving the numbers ... 132 would
never have come down,'' Chain said.
   The general oversees the nation's force of nuclear bombers,
intercontinental ballistic missiles, tankers and reconnaissance
aircraft at SAC in Omaha, Neb.
   Cheney named budget pressures and the changed situation in the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in presenting his reassessment of
the needs for the futuristic strategic bomber last week to Congress.
   Buying fewer planes will drive up the cost of each bomber.
   The bombers would cost $530 million apiece if 132 are purchased.
If only 75 are bought, they would cost $815 million each, making
them the costliest aircraft ever produced.
   Congressional opposition to the aircraft has grown as lawmakers
scramble to glean a ``peace dividend'' from the Pentagon budget.
   Chain, who has been an ardent advocate on behalf of the
132-bomber request, said he could support the revised figure
because of the changes that have brought democratic governments to
nations in Eastern Europe.
   ``One hundred thirty-two was justified in the world in which it
was created. ... Seventy-five is an adequate number, an adequate
number of warheads for the task we have in the future,'' he said.
   The four-star general said he believes ``if the world turns
ugly'' several years from now, the president could order the number
of bombers increased. ``It's not a finite number,'' he said.
   But Chain said he couldn't support a purchase of fewer than 75
planes.

   Lawmakers in jeans. Long hair. Lapel
buttons. Oranges. Once the domain of gray-suited somber Communists,
Parliament is more like an old-world coffee house where writers,
artists and actors mingle with politicians, professors and lawyers.
   The new face of Hungary's Parliament reflects the changes that
have swept Eastern Europe. Even the social affairs minister in the
Communist government that is now history is keeping up with the
changing times, donning gauchos in place of her conservative
dresses.
   Like the legislatures of Warsaw and East Berlin, the lofty
rotunda was once where aging Communist hard-liners listened to
interminable speeches and rubber-stamped legislation.
   Today 20-to-35-year-old Parliament deputies, the engines of
Eastern Europe's stunning transformation, file in en bloc. They are
members of the League of Young Democrats, or FIDESZ, and come
accompanied by jeans-clad supporters waving balloons and flags.
   Viktor Orban, a fiery orator and energetic FIDESZ deputy, has
long hair and no tie.
   For the first session of the new free parliament, FIDESZ placed
oranges _ their symbol of the failure of Communist ideology to mold
reality to its will _ on the lawmakers' desks. At the end of the
day, the ashtrays were piled high with orange peels.
   How do they feel, the former dissidents, often jailed for
touting democracy and freedom of speech?
   ``I expected an emotional touch,'' says Laszlo Rajk, Jr.,
drawing on a cigarette. ``But it didn't come.'' He looks around for
an ashtray in the still unfamiliar surroundings of the vaulted,
red-carpeted halls.
   Did he expect the transition to be this smooth?
   ``Oh, yes. But not this successful,'' he grins.
   Did they expect this to happen?
   ``Ten years ago, no,'' says Miklos Haraszti ``Two years ago,''
he smiles. ``Yes, I did.''
   In March 1988 he called an Associated Press reporter to announce
he was being detained by police that moment at his home. No reason
given. But everyone knew. A demonstration planned the next day.
   Only one dissident was left free that March 15. He led about
10,000 pro-democracy demonstrators through city streets, weaving
them carefully between the lines of truncheon-gripping police.
   Miklos Tamas-Gaspar sips a glass of wine at the buffet during a
break, puffing on a cigar, speaking English with an impeccable
British accent. He was elected in a by-election a few months before
free national elections in March and April ended Communist rule.
   ``We won't ask you how you feel,'' jokes a reporter. ``We
consider you an old hand now.''
   In the chamber itself, something is missing. The Communist coat
of arms.
   It still adorns the walls of schools and state offices where
voters went to cast their ballots in the first free elections in
more than 40 years.
   Ominous?
   ``It's like rennaissance times'' shrugged a member of the
Democratic Forum _ the center-right party that now has the mandate
to form a new government. Hungarians have ``one foot in the past
and the other in the future.''
   No new coat of arms has yet been designed. But every other
member of Parliament touts a traditional Hungarian emblem in his
lapel, along with party affiliation.
   The red star, balanced for decades on the spire of the sprawling
neo-Gothic building, no longer reflects in the Danube river. It was
quietly removed in March.
   The few Socialists _ former Communists, the only ones in Eastern
Europe who understood if they hoped to survive they must reform _
were rewarded at the polls with popular anger at so many years of
Stalinist oppression. They have only 33 of 394 seats, off to one
side.
   Outgoing interim President Matyas Szueroes, formerly a Communsit
foreign policy expert, now takes his seat on a regular bench for
lawmakers.

   West German officials are dangling the
prospect of more economic ties in front of the Soviets in an effort
to soften their adamant rejection of a united Germany as a NATO
member.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in an interview Friday
with the West Berlin radio station RIAS, said there could be
``versatile economic relations that would not be disadvantageous to
the Soviets Union after German unification.''
   However, asked if a united Germany can be in NATO, Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze responded Friday shortly after
his arrival in West Germany with a firm ``no.''
   ``For such a giant to belong to one bloc, one alliance ... will
not create conditions for stability,'' he said.
   The Soviets have called for a neutral Germany.
   Shevardnadze also met Friday for about 90 minutes with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The West Germans made clear they were willing to offer something
in exchange for a shift in the Kremlin's position on the military
posture of a united Germany.
   Kohl spokesman Hans Klein said the chancellor offered
Shevardnadze a significant expansion of bilateral ties,
particularly economic cooperation.
   West Germany is already one of the Soviet Union's biggest
trading partners and has indicated a willingness to guarantee East
German exports to the Soviet Union. The latest offer seemed to
signal Bonn's readiness to expand trade and investments, although
Klein did not offer specifics.
   The Soviet Union has said repeatedly that it opposes allowing a
united Germany to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   NATO foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on
Thursday, said they remain in favor of a single German state
belonging to the Western alliance.
   But they also offered several compromise gestures to the
Soviets, saying that a united Germany should not have any chemical
or nuclear weapons and that Soviet troops could remain in what is
now East Germany for several years.
   The question of security arrangements are a major obstacle at
talks beginning today in Bonn among the two Germanys and the four
World War II Allies.

   Richard Nixon, a veteran political
prognosticator, says only serious trouble in the economy would give
Democrats a chance to recapture the White House in 1992.
   And the Democrat best equipped to challenge George Bush if the
economy turns sour is New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, Nixon said in a
television interview aired Friday night.
   The interview, one of a series the former president has done
this week to promote his new book, was broadcast on public
television stations.
   Nixon said Bush is popular because of a ``mistake-free
administration,'' while the Democratic opposition is the weakest in
50 years.
   ``Cuomo would be able to seize on the haves vs. the have-not
issue more effectively than any of the other Democrats because of
his appeal,'' Nixon said. ``Cuomo has high intelligence. He has
heart, or at least he appears to have, and that's what matters.''
   Nixon said he seldom offers advice to Bush because ``there's
nothing that you appreciate less than having well-intentioned
(people), even former presidents, calling and saying, `Why don't
you do this, why don't you do that?'''

   Prosecutors in the drug trial of Washington,
D.C., Mayor Marion Barry say they should not be required to give
his lawyers copies of regulations that govern drug investigations
or provide details of the case against him.
   In another development, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson on Friday scheduled for May 25 a pre-trial hearing on a
series of motions by the mayor seeking dismissal of the eight
criminal charges against him.
   Barry's lawyers say he is the victim of prosecutorial
``overreach'' by a U.S. attorney's office that violated government
regulations in an FBI sting operation leading to the mayor's arrest.
   Barry was arrested Jan. 18 after being videotaped smoking crack
cocaine in a Washington hotel room. He is accused of five
misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession and three felony counts of
lying to a federal grand jury about his involvement with drugs.
   In one motion, the mayor's lawyers said the government violated
its own procedures in the arrest, and demanded the government
produce its regulations for undercover drug operations.
   In a court filing Friday in reply, prosecutors said Barry should
not be given the regulations.
   ``Even if there were a violation of an agency regulation _ and
the government vigorously denies that there was _ it would not
entitle'' Barry ``to any relief unless'' his constitutional rights
were violated, they said.
   Disclosing the guidelines ``could compromise ongoing and future
undercover operations,'' they wrote.

<HEAD>Private Companies Make Corn Sale To Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private exporting companies have sold the
Soviet Union an additional 600,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for
delivery this year under a long-term supply agreement, the
Agriculture Department says.
   Orders since Oct. 1, the beginning of the agreement's new year,
now total about 13.9 million tons of corn, 3.3 million tons of
wheat, 342,300 tons of soybeans and 1.2 million tons of soybean
meal, the department said Friday. In addition, sales of barley
total 7,300 tons.
   The current long-term agreement expires on Dec. 31. A five-year
pact to replace it has been tentatively approved by U.S. and Soviet
negotiators.
   Meanwhile, the latest sales raised the total for 1989-90
delivery to almost 17.2 million tons, the announcement said. In
1988-89, sales were a record of more than 21.7 million tons,
including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4
million tons of wheat.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 600,000 tons of
corn would be about 23.6 million bushels.
   The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting
companies, which are required to report large sales to the
department.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rift has developed in East Germany's first
non-Communist government, with a major partner in the fragile
coalition accusing leaders of letting West Germany dictate the
terms for reunification.
   ``In the East Berlin Cabinet stands a crack in the house,
because we up to now cannot be held responsible for the outcome of
the (unification) state treaty,'' Richard Schroeder, head of the
Social Democrat faction in Parliament, said Friday.
   ``I am worried about a break in the axle on the way to unity,''
he said.
   Experts from both Germanys met in East Berlin on Friday for
ongoing talks on shifting East Germany away from a socialist
economy as quickly as possible.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats hold important Cabinet posts
in the government of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere. But they
have begun distancing themselves from agreements on merging the two
economies.
   Their latest criticism could put the shaky coalition government
in jeopardy.
   Although the Social Democrats agreed to join the government of
de Maiziere, who leads the conservative Christian Democrats, they
complained Friday that the terms of the economic union would create
hardships for East Germans.
   Social Minister Regine Hildebrandt, a Social Democrat,
criticized the decision between the governments to tailor East
Germany's pension program to West Germany's. She said it would
reduce benefits for East Germans.
   The economies and social institutions of the two nations are to
merge on July 2 as a prelude to full unification next year.
   But Social Democrats have become increasingly critical of what
they say is a willingness to accept Bonn's terms and the lack of
guarantees to protect East Germans who will give up enormous social
subsidies.
   De Maiziere, whose party finished first in the March 18
elections, formed a coalition with the Social Democrats to have the
two-third Parliament majority needed to make constitutional changes
that would make unification possible.
   On Sunday, East Germans will vote in local elections. They are
expected to remove the last traces of Communist control and put the
finishing touches on the social revolution that began a year ago.
   The balloting will turn over to local hands the obedient
bureaucracies that were carefully controlled by the former
hard-line leadership.
   The balloting also may provide a gauge of the current mood
toward German unification, a process that is speeding toward
completion. Talks among the two Germanys and four World War II
Allies were being held today in Bonn, West Germany.
   More than 12 million voters in 7,800 cities, districts and other
municipalities are eligible to vote in the elections. Sixty-two
parties and more than a quarter-million candidates are registered
to run.
   The elections come against a backdrop of widespread protests in
recent weeks by East German workers afraid that their factories
will close when forced to compete with Western commerce.
   However, West Germany says a quick move to a free market will
create jobs, raise living standards and eventually eliminate the
economic hardships of the early stages of unification.
   The two governments agreed on the general terms of an economic
union on Wednesday. It would exchange salaries, wages and small
savings accounts of East Germans for an equal amount of West German
marks.
   Wolfgang Tierse, deputy chief of the Social Democrats faction,
said his party would not endorse the economic and social treaty
that is being negotiated as a basis for unification. He said it
would bring ``massive poverty.''

   An all-white jury sentenced a former police
chief and two former deputies, all three white, to prison terms of
10 to 28 years for beating to death a black prisoner in 1987.
   Activists, who had been monitoring the trial, proclaimed the
verdict Friday a victory for racial justice.
   ``I think justice has been served, and it certainly is a
compliment to the criminal justice system that it worked,'' said
Pearlie Henderson, a local civil rights activist. ``If a person
wears a law badge, he's not beyond the law himself.''
   The jury sentenced former Hemphill Police Chief Thomas Ladner to
28 years for the murder of Loyal Garner Jr. Former Sabine County
sheriff's deputy Billy Ray Horton and former deputy James M. Hyden
drew sentences of 10 and 14 years, respectively.
   Garner, a 34-year-old father of six from Florien, La., died Dec.
27, 1987, of severe head injuries he suffered at the county jail
after his Christmas Day arrest on drunken driving charges. He had
no criminal record.
   Horton and Hyden were allowed to remain free on bonds of $25,000
because their sentences were less than 15 years in prison. Ladner
was taken into custody.
   The 12-member jury had convicted the three men of murder on
Thursday.
   Corrine Garner, widow of the victim, said: ``I'm glad. I'm happy
that they were convicted and they got time. .. They should have
gotten life.''
   Garner's father said he wanted longer sentences, but was
satisfied the three men would pay for his son's death.
   ``He's been missed, you know. I was so used to him,'' he said.
   The three former lawmen were acquitted of civil rights charges
in Garner's death in 1988, and their lawyers plan to appeal on
grounds the murder trial constituted double jeopardy.
   The NAACP began monitoring the trial in Tyler, about 100 miles
east of Dallas, after jury selection resulted in another all-white
jury.
   Black leaders said they hadn't expected guilty verdicts.
   ``It's a great feeling,'' said Vollie Grace, president of the
Hemphill chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People. ``It restored my faith in the system.''
   Some in the courtroom wept Friday as Prosecutor Jack Skeen asked
for life sentences.
   ``Establish by your verdict the real meaning of Smith County
justice,'' Skeen told the jury. ``This is Loyal Garner Jr.'s last
chance.''
   Ladner's attorney, John Seale, compared Skeen's efforts to those
of a lynch mob.
   ``On one occasion, these men got mad, lost their temper and
overreacted,'' he said.

<DATELINE>ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities closed off
this violence-torn reservation again after allowing outsiders to
attend the funeral of a Mohawk Indian killed in a violent feud over
casino gambling.
   The reservation, which straddles the border with Canada in
northern New York, was opened Friday to journalists and outsiders
as the Mohawks buried Matthew Pyke, the first of two Indians slain
in the conflict.
   But state police sealed off all roads shortly before nightfall.
New York and Canadian police have been stationed here since Tuesday
to keep the peace.
   ``Things are still touchy,'' state trooper Ronald Clark said.
``We want to try to keep things stable here to allow the
negotiations to begin.''
   A specially assembled mediation team dispatched by the U.S.
Justice Department was arriving today to buttress the efforts of
one federal mediator already on the scene, said Grace Flores
Hughes, director of the department's Community Relations Service in
Washington.
   In Ottawa, Canadian Indian Affairs Minister Tom Siddon said the
Canadian and U.S. governments would help Mohawk leaders find a
lasting solution to peace.
   ``We have to keep in mind that governments must not impose
solutions that are not welcome,'' he said. ``So there's no magic
formula for governments to pull out of a bag somewhere and say
here's the answer to your problems.''
   Siddon said a liaison committee will now look at longer-term
solutions, including economic alternatives to gambling. But first,
he said, a dialogue had to be restored between all parties on the
reservation.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said he would press for creation of an
independent Mohawk police force on the reservation.
   Outsiders have been barred from entering the 28,000-acre
reservation since the 22-year-old Pyke and Harold Edwards Jr., 32,
were shot to death during a protracted gun battle early Tuesday.
Pyke was a gambling opponent; Edwards was on the pro-gambling side.
   The reservation, home to about 9,000 Mohawks, has been torn by
sporadic violence since last July, when the FBI and state police
raided casinos on the American side. Gambling opponents say the
casinos breed crime; supporters say they are an economic boon for
the reservation.
   The warring factions laid aside their differences Friday to
honor Pyke, who was buried at a cemetery a few blocks from his
family's home.
   Forty Mohawks wearing clan beads, embroidered shirts and other
traditional Indian dress led a funeral procession of about 500
people before the service at St. Regis Catholic Church.
   A woman in the front row carried a framed picture of Pyke, while
mourners at the rear sang ``Give Peace a Chance,'' the anti-war
song by the late John Lennon.
   ``We're putting aside our anger for the day,'' said Eddie Gray.
``It's a day for mourning.''
   Members of the Warrior Society were not invited, but they
observed two hours of silence in Pyke's honor.
   ``It's our traditional belief that we have total respect for the
dead,'' Minnie Garrow said.
   Edwards was to be buried Monday after a service at the same
church.

   A self-avowed CIA contract agent was found
innocent of lying about an alleged meeting at which officials in
the Reagan-Bush campaign asked Iran to delay the release of U.S.
hostages until after the 1980 election.
   Richard J. Brenneke, a controversial figure who also has been at
the center of Iran-Contra investigations, was found innocent of
five counts of false declaration for statements made before a
federal judge in Denver in 1988.
   At the time, Brenneke was appearing as a character witness for
Denver gold dealer Heinrich Rupp, whom Brenneke said he met in 1957
when they worked together in Southeast Asia for a CIA proprietary,
Air America.
   Rupp was convicted of bank fraud and is serving a 41-year prison
term.
   Brenneke told the Denver court that he and Rupp in October 1980
helped arrange clandestine meetings involving the hostage crisis,
and that Rupp flew George Bush, then a candidate for vice
president, to Paris for the meetings.
   Brenneke told of three hostage meetings at two Paris hotels. But
he testified Thursday that he did not actually see Bush in Paris.
   Brenneke's trial originally was to have been held in Denver but
was moved to Portland, near Brenneke's home, after he had open
heart surgery. The trial started April 24 but was interrupted when
Brenneke was hospitalized with chest pains.
   Prosecutors described Brenneke as a rejected CIA applicant who
operated on the fringes, trying to become a broker of arms and
intelligence and lying about his exploits. But the 12-member jury,
after deliberating for five hours, said it believed Brenneke's
story.
   Defense lawyer Michael Scott said the verdict did not mean that
witnesses in the case such as Donald P. Gregg, the U.S. ambassador
to South Korea, had lied. Nor does it mean that Bush was in Paris
for the alleged meetings, Scott said.
   The verdict ``means that the jury did not find my client
guilty,'' Scott said.
   Outside the courtroom, a smiling Brenneke said, ``We told the
truth, we told the truth all along and, by God, it was believed.''
   In Washington, D.C., Stephen Hart, deputy White House press
secretary, declined any comment on the case.
   Brenneke has claimed in numerous media interviews to have
detailed knowledge about aspects of the Iran-Contra arms scandal.
   In 1988, he testified at hearings organized by Sen. John F.
Kerry, D-Mass., that he had flown drugs from Colombia to Texas in
1985 as part of a supply operation for the Contras. He said that
Gregg, then Bush's national security adviser, knew of the flights.
   Brenneke also claimed to have bought arms for the Contras in
Czechoslovakia.
   Then-Vice President Bush called Benneke's claims ``slanderous.''
   In April 1989, Kerry's narcotics and international relations
subcommittee declared Brenneke an unreliable witness.
   Brenneke, in his mid-40s, has run an offshore investment fund,
worked as a computer programmer, and as a dealer in the
international arms market. The CIA denies he ever worked for the
agency.
   In his closing arguments Friday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas
M. O'Rourke dismissed as a fabrication Brenneke's description of
the secret Paris meeting and its purpose: to sabotage President
Carter's re-election campaign by delaying the hostage release.
   Brenneke said the meetings were attended by the late CIA
director William Casey, then chairman of the Reagan campaign, and
Gregg, then a CIA agent assigned to Carter's National Security
Council staff.
   Gregg testified last week that he was not in Paris when Brenneke
said the talks took place. He produced snapshots from a family
vacation at the Delaware seashore.
   On Wednesday, a local meteorologist testified that he had
consulted 1980 weather maps and found Gregg's photographs could not
have been taken when he said they were shot.
   Former National Security Adviser Richard V. Allen, who testified
as a defense witness, said the 1980 campaign was concerned about an
``October surprise'' from Carter that would tilt the campaign away
from Reagan.
   Allen said the campaign had learned from an inside source, who
was later identified to him as Secretary of State Edmund Muskie,
that Carter was close to getting the hostages released that October.
   Allen said he did not attend any meeting in Paris.
   The 52 American hostages, seized Nov. 4, 1979 at the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran, were released Jan. 20, 1981, the day President
Reagan was sworn in.

   Francois Mitterrand begins his 10th year as
France's president next week with his popularity plummeting and his
political integrity under harsh attack in a new best-selling
biography.
   Some political analysts predict Mitterrand's problems will
worsen in the coming months. Others suggest the Socialist president
will bounce back as he has many times in an up-and-down, 45-year
political career.
   Recent public opinion polls show a dramatic drop in popularity
for the 73-year-old president.
   A Sofres survey recorded a 12-point fall from 61 to 53 percent
in a single month, while a poll by the Journal du Dimanche
newspaper found only 39 percent of respondents satisfied with
Mitterrand's performance.
   ``Don't ever forget: Francois Mitterrand is an artist of
resurrection,'' says Franz-Olivier Geisbert, author of the new
unflattering biography. ``In 1980 he was finished. In 1981 he was
elected president of the Republic.''
   Geisbert, 41, a prominent journalist who has worked for both
leftist and conservative publications, has been following
Mitterrand's career for many years.
   His second book on Mitterrand, ``The President,'' is filled with
revealing anecdotes and interviews and conversations with
presidential advisors, ministers, opposition leaders, reporters,
and Mitterrand himself.
   Currently on the best-seller list, it strips away Mitterrand's
image as a lofty, high-principled statesman and depicts him instead
as a ruthless scheming politician who ``squeezed aside principle
and ideology'' to carve out his place in history.
   ``The whole Mitterrand is there, in this mix of electoral
cynicism and artistic haze. He does not let himself be burdened by
scruples when power is at stake,'' he wrote.
   The book is a devastating behind-the-scenes look at how
Mitterrand exercises presidential power by manipulating political
allies and enemies.
   It chronicles his intense dislike of his longtime Socialist
rival, Michel Rocard, whom he relegated to minor Cabinet posts
until attrition among his stalwarts forced him to name Rocard as
prime minister after Mitterrand's reelection in 1988 to a second
seven-year term.
   The book also describes how Mitterrand cleverly engineered a
leftist coalition to beat Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1981. The
maneuver was doubly useful to Mitterrand. It led, ultimately, to
the decline of the Communist Party and fueled the rise of the
extreme-right National Front party, which has discredited and
divided conservative political factions ever since.
   Mitterrand's troubles have been making headlines for weeks.
Political analysts attribute them to several events, including the
amnesty of a former Socialist minister involved in a political
fund-raising scandal.
   After the Socialist Party congress in April turned into a mean
dogfight among contenders to the presidency (not vacant until
1995), Mitterrand descended into the arena and gave a rare
television interview trying to explain the mess. His efforts
appeared to make matters worse.
   Analysts say Mitterrand's drop in popularity can be explained by
his loss of favor among voters with political sympathies on the
right. Many of these voters backed Mitterrand in 1988, viewing him
a reassuring father figure comparable to Charles de Gaulle, who
would work for the broad national interest.
   ``The key to his reelection was his ability to preserve
influence beyond the political and sociological boundaries of the
left,'' noted Eric Dupin in Liberation.
   This loss of right-leaning voters has not been countered by an
increase of support from the left, such as young people and
blue-collar workers.
   ``Mitterrand is looking for the choke to get going again,''
headlined Liberation, a leftist daily. ``The Elysee (palace) seems
to have run out of inspiration, and enthusiasm.''

<HEAD>Mary Ann Vecchio Just Wants to Forget Kent State</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto CDX1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A long-awaited memorial symbolizes the desire to record what
happened at Kent State University 20 years ago, but the woman whose
photographic image became an enduring symbol of that era would
rather forget.
   The photograph portrayed an anguished Mary Ann Veccio, then 14,
kneeling beside the lifeless body of one of four students slain by
the National Guard on May 4, 1970.
   The photograph won a Pulitzer Prize for John Filo, a student
photographer now deputy picture editor at Sports Illustrated
magazine. It has become a classic recording of the violent shock of
the Vietnam War and its repercussions at home.
   But the photograph hounded Vecchio into seeking seclusion.
   ``It really destroyed my life and I don't want to talk about
it,'' the 34-year-old casino worker in Las Vegas told The Orlando
Sentinel this week.
   She wasn't interested in discussing the memorial dedicated
Friday on the Kent State campus to the four slain and nine injured
students in the anti-war demonstration.
   ``Big deal. It has nothing to do with my life,'' Vecchio said.
   Her image can't be shaken loose from memories of that sunny
afternoon: Her arms raised, her faced in a grimace, kneeling over
the bleeding body of Jeffrey Miller, who had been shot in the mouth
after lobbing a tear-gas canister back at the approaching Guard.
   Students were protesting President Nixon's bombing of Cambodia
and the continuation of the Vietnam War.
   Vecchio was a runaway from the Miami area at the time, and she
believes her later run-ins with the law were due to what the photo
came to symbolize.
   Then-Florida Gov. Claude Kirk ``said she was planted there by
the communists, and people wrote letters that she was responsible
for murdering all those children,'' Vecchio's mother, 63-year-old
Claire, said from the house in Opa-locka, Fla., where she raised
Mary Ann and five other children.
   ``Can you imagine a 14-year-old girl having to deal with that?''
   Vecchio's father, Frank, a maintenance worker for the Dade
County Port Authority before he died, recognized his daughter's
face in the photo. He traced her to Indianapolis and had her
returned home.
   Later Vecchio was sent to a juvenile home, and she was arrested
for petty crimes such as loitering and marijuana possession. The
press hounded her, she said.
   ``I've been miserable since Kent State,'' she said five years
after the shootings. ``Not for any political reasons, but after all
the publicity I've received, I feel the police have been
unnecessarily harassing me.''
   Vecchio soon tired of the annual remembrances and refused to
take part.
   She married a plumber from Kentucky in Las Vegas 11 years ago
and they live in a quiet, elm-shaded mobile-home park filled with
retirees.
   Vecchio returned to school for her high school diploma and has
worked her way to a management position at a casino, supervising an
army of cashiers.
   Others whose lives were tied to the Kent State killings hoped to
ease their pain at the memorial dedication Friday.
   ``We hope to promote an atmosphere of reconciliation,'' said
Florence Schroeder, whose son, Bill, was another of the students
killed, told about 4,000 people gathered for an hour-long ceremony.
   Former U.S. Sen. George McGovern said the $200,000 memorial
should encourage reconciliation between the United States and
Vietnam, which do not have diplomatic relations.
   ``The war in Vietnam is unfinished,'' said McGovern, the
Democratic presidential candidate in 1972. ``The killing has
stopped, but the arrogance that produced it survives, and so does
the agony, the guilt and the separation.''
   The memorial, on 2{ acres adjacent to the parking lot where the
students were killed, includes a granite plaza with four pylons
similar in shape to elongated gravestones.
   A smaller, waist-high marker, was erected in honor of the slain
students in 1971.
   Although she and her husband, Louis, participated in the
ceremony, the families of Miller and Allison Krause did not show
up, university spokeswoman Janet Thiede said.
   Ms. Krause's mother, Doris Krause of Monroeville, Pa., had said
she did not plan to attend because she believed the memorial should
have been bigger and built earlier.
   The parents of the fourth victim, Sandra Scheuer, were on campus
but did not speak at the ceremonies.

<HEAD>Exxon Hikes Compensation to Some Salmon Fishermen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA RUBIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Exxon said it is paying a total of $62
million to compensate Kodiak and Chignik fishermen for 1989 salmon
losses from the Exxon Valdez oil spill, but angry fishermen say
it's not enough.
   The company said Friday it had paid about $50 million to Kodiak
fishermen and $4 million to Chignik fishermen so far, and would pay
an additional $8 million to the two groups because last year's
neglected salmon run was bigger than anticipated.
   Most fishing was prohibited last year because of fears the oil
could enter the food chain through the fish. The spill's long-term
effect on salmon fishing isn't yet known.
   ``We're not only living by our commitment that we made early on
to compensate them for everything they expected to get, but we're
paying them for an even greater volume of fish,'' said Exxon claim
manager Dave Shoup.
   The fishermen, however, said they expected more than twice as
much in additional compensation, and accused Exxon of ``breaking
faith.''
   ``They're about $10.8 million short'' of Kodiak fishermen's
claims, said Jeff Stephan, president of United Fishermen's
Marketing Association in Kodiak.
   ``They've told us all along in a public relations campaign that
they expect to make the fishermen whole. They've said that to me
100 times in negotiations. And we believed them,'' he said.
   ``Well, we're sitting here in May and the fishermen are nowhere
near whole.''
   The major point of contention is whether fishermen should be
compensated for more than $6 million in salmon harvested at the
state-owned Kitoi Hatchery by the hatchery's operator.
   Fishermen say they suffered by not being the ones to harvest
those fish and so should be compensated for them by the oil
company. Exxon says it won't compensate the fishermen for fish that
were harvested _ only for those that weren't.
   Exxon's voluntary compensation program doesn't officially settle
fishermen's claims, many of which are in lawsuits filed in state
and federal court. The lawsuits include claims of lost
opportunities, mental anguish and and other damages.
   Kodiak Island is about 250 miles southwest of Bligh Reef in
Prince William Sound, where the Exxon Valdez ran aground in March
24, 1989, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil.
   The village of Chignik, on the Alaska Peninsula, lies across the
Shelikof Strait from Kodiak.
   Negotiations will continue with the fishermen over the company's
voluntary claims program as well, Shoup said.

<HEAD>Shiite Spiritual Leader Wants Israel Pressured To Free Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The spiritual mentor of Moslem militants
holding Western hostages says no more of the captives should be
freed unless Israel releases Arab prisoners, a newspaper reported
today.
   ``We want the states of the world to pressure Israel into
releasing Arab prisoners the same way they exert pressure for the
release of Western hostages,'' al-Anwar quoted Sheik Mohammed
Hussein Fadlallah as telling a Friday prayer sermon.
   Americans Frank Reed and Robert Polhill have been released by
their Lebanese captors in the past two weeks.
   Most of the remaining 16 Westerners missing in Lebanon,
including six Americans, are believed to be held by Iranian-backed
Shiite Moslem groups in Beirut's southern shantytowns, a stronghold
of the fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Fadlallah, Hezbollah's ``spiritual guide,'' declared: ``We don't
want the human rights and freedom of anyone to be achieved at our
expense,'' in apparent rejection of the release of Western captives
without a reciprocal move by Israel.
   ``Either (our people) will be free or we will not respect the
freedom of the world that does not respect our freedom,'' he added.
   The conservative al-Anwar carried the full text of Fadlallah's
address.
   The missing Westerners comprise six Americans, four Britons, two
Swiss, two West Germans, an Italian and an Irishman. American Terry
Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held captive. He was kidnapped in Moslem west
Beirut March 16, 1985.
   Hezbollah issued a statement Friday blaming the United States
for hindering the release of Western captives.
   ``The U.S. administration bears the responsibility for any
complications in this issue,'' it said.
   ``The ball is now in America's court after the efforts that had
been exerted by the Islamic republic and Syria to free two
Americans as a step toward resolving the question of all the
hostages,'' the statement said.
   Polhill, 55, was freed April 22 after 39 months in captivity.
Reed, 57, was released eight days later after 42 months as a
hostage.
   Iran and Syria have called for a reciprocal goodwill gesture
from the United States.
   Iranian newspapers and some of the Shiite kidnap groups have
demanded that as a precondition for further hostage releases,
Israel frees some 400 Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners it holds.
   The hostage-holders also have demanded freedom for 15 convicted
militants imprisoned in Kuwait for the bombing of the U.S. and
French embassies there in December 1983.
   Israel and Kuwait have refused to negotiate with terrorists and
the United States has said it would not pressure them into bowing
to the kidnappers' demands.

   Scattered showers helped firefighters bring under
control a four-day-old blaze that charred an estimated 25,000 acres
of the Everglades as it closed in on a federal wildlife preserve.
   Firefighters counted on the L-67 canal as the last line of
defense between the wall of flames and 150,000 drought-crisp
wetlands to the west. Officials are concerned the fire could jump
the 100-foot-wide canal and move into the sprawling Big Cypress
National Wildlife Preserve.
   Friday evening, firefighters reported they had controlled the
blaze and would continue monitoring for possible flare-ups.
   ``With that rain, it slowed it down a little bit, brought the
humidity up,'' said John Kern of the state Division of Forestry.
   The fire apparently was sparked accidentally in an area
frequented by people on motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles, said
senior state forester Gene Dempsey.
   Despite the size of the scorched area, about 25 miles west of
downtown Miami, wildlife officials say there has been little affect
on animals because the severe drought already had forced most
species to water.
   ``We have a few snakes and rodents scurrying away, but that's
about it,'' said senior state forester Gene Dempsey.
   David Maehr, a Florida panther biologist with the state Game and
Fresh Water Fish Commission, said the 17 cats wearing the agency's
radio-tracking collars were checked Friday and were ``nowhere near
any danger from fire.''
   About 30 to 50 panthers are believed to roam the wilds of South
Florida, making them one of the world's rarest mammals.
   No inhabited areas were threatened by the blaze, one of three
west of Miami.
   Another fire in Everglades National Park, about 27 miles
southwest of the city, scorched 10,500 acres by Friday.
Firefighters expected to control it today, said park spokeswoman
Darlene Koontz.
   Another fire, on the Seminole reservation in Broward County, was
contained after burning 800 acres, Dempsery said.

   The J. Paul Getty Museum was denied an export
license for a $12 million sculpture after the government announced
new guidelines for exporting art treasures.
   The Department of Trade and Industry announced Friday that works
of art considered important to Britain's heritage cannot be
exported if a British buyer can be found.
   The Malibu, Calif.-based Getty Museum applied to export the
``Three Graces'' from Britain in March 1989 after its $12.4 million
bid was accepted by the sculpture's owners, a trust in Britain's
Caribbean Cayman Islands colony.
   The export license was deferred while the government sought a
public owner for the 19th-century statue of three standing nude
women.
   The National Galleries of Scotland said Friday it is interested
and pledged $1.64 million toward the cost.
   The sculptor, Canova, was a leading artist of the neoclassical
movement and worked for the Vatican and European aristocracy. He
died in 1922.

<HEAD>Doctor: Soccer Player Contracts AIDS After Collision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VARESE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A doctor says an Italian man contracted the
AIDS virus after colliding with an infected drug abuser during a
soccer game near this northern town.
   The incident was first reported in a letter published in the
latest issue of The Lancet, a respected British medical journal.
Five doctors from the Varese Regional Hospital's infectious
diseases unit signed the letter.
   Dr. Donato Torre, one of the five, said Friday other cases of
transmission of the AIDS virus from sporting accidents have been
documented in the United States and Britain.
   The doctors said the incident occurred when two players crashed
into each other during an informal soccer game in December near
Varese, near the Swiss border. The virus was apparently transmitted
from deep cuts to their eyebrows and foreheads.
   The letter said that two months after the accident, during a
routine blood test, the previously uninfected man's blood serum was
found to carry the HIV-1 virus, which causes AIDS. A year before
the injury, another routine blood test had shown he was uninfected.
   In the telephone interview, Torre said the other man involved
was a member of a soccer team made up of players from a drug
rehabilitation center.
   ``In the absence of other risk factors, this case is compatible
with the acquisition of HIV-1 infection by traumatic contact with a
seropositive man,'' the letter said.
   AIDS is a deadly affliction in which a virus attacks the body's
immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of
infections and cancers. It is spread mainly by sexual contact, the
use of contaminated needles among drug abusers, and transfusion of
tainted blood.
   The doctors who signed the letter said the patient who
contracted the AIDS virus after the collision denied drug abuse; he
had not had blood transfusions, injections or dental care; and he
had not been to such high-risk areas as Africa or the Caribbean.
   He has been in a stable relationship for four years with a woman
who was uninfected and he did not have sex with other women, the
letter said.
   The men were not identified for reasons of privacy.
   In the telephone interview, Torre said new standard procedures
were needed to handle such accidents.
   ``It's logical that when accident victims suffer lesions with
bleeding and they come into contact with another accident victim,
such as in a car accident, they should be tested immediately for
the HIV virus,'' he said.

<HEAD>Earthquake Strikes Southern Italy, At Least 2 Injured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A moderate earthquake rocked southern Italy
this morning, causing damage and injuring at least two people.
   The quake measured 4.8 on the Richter scale, according to the
National Institute of Geophysics in Rome. The temblor at 9:30 a.m.
(2:30 a.m. EDT) and subsequent aftershocks sent frightened
residents running into the streets.
   Southern Italy has been struck by devastating temblors in the
past, including one in 1980 that killed about 3,000 people in the
Naples region.
   The epicenter was about 95 miles southeast of Naples. However,
the temblor was felt as far south as the regions of Calabria and
Puglia, the toe and heel of the Italian ``boot.''
   Two people were injured in Potenza, about 80 miles southeast of
Naples, when chunks of molding fell from the walls inside their
homes.
   Damage to older buildings was reported, but the extent was not
immeditely clear.
   The national telephone company, SIP, reported lines were tied up
by calls to fire departments and other authorities. It issued a
statement asking people to limit their calls to emergency cases.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage in populated
areas, while one measuring 5 can cause considerable damage.

<HEAD>Colombia, Fearing Drug Violence, Helps Candidates Cut Appearances</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fearing more deadly attacks on
candidates, the government is buying radio and TV ads for
presidential hopefuls to cut down on risky public appearances.
   Three presidential candidates have been killed since August,
when drug traffickers launched a war against the government that
has left nearly 300 people dead. The traffickers are blamed for at
least two of the assassinations.
   In the drug capital of Medellin on Friday, police killed six
unidentified men during a shootout at a shopping center.
   The decree by President Virgilio Barco earmarked $340,000 to
allow all 13 contenders for May 27 elections to buy air time. The
Thursday order increased free time on government-owned television
for candidates' speeches.
   It also said voters will decide whether the country's
constitution should be reformed. There is widespread support for
proposals intended to strengthen the judicial system and reduce the
drug cartels' influence in the congress.
   ``The urgent strengthening of institutions is necessary for a
return to normality and to overcome a situation in which public
security is constantly disturbed,'' said the presidential decree.
The proposal would need the support of 51 percent of the voters.
   Despite the government help in campaign advertising,
presidential candidate Cesar Gaviria of the governing Liberal Party
traveled Friday to the eastern city of Bucaramanga. His campaign
said he would make a series of appearances in public plazas.
   Gaviria had suspended his campaign activities after the April 26
assassination of Carlos Pizarro, a leftist presidential contender
and former guerrilla leader. An assassin shot and killed Pizarro,
the candidate for the April 19 Movement, aboard a Colombian
jetliner.
   In previous months of the campaign, candidates Sen. Luis Carlos
Galan of the Liberal Party and Bernardo Jaramillo of the Patriotic
Union were assassinated. The slaying of Galan in August set off a
U.S.-backed government crackdown on the traffickers.
   Authorities say they believe the assassins of Galan and
Jaramillo were working for drug traffickers. The media, citing
security sources, have reported drug traffickers were the main
suspects in Pizarro's killing. But the Medellin cartel denied
involvement and no government official has yet said who was
responsible.
   Also Friday, a government official blamed druglords for a
car-bomb attack that killed four people, including a 3-year-old
girl, in the southern city of Cali on Thursday night.
   The Cali car bomb, which carried 220 pounds of dynamite, wounded
36 people and destroyed several buildings when it exploded in front
of a drugstore in the city's commercial district.
   ``This was a demented attack carried out by persons tied to the
Medellin cartel,'' Raul Caicedo, the secretary of Cali's municipal
government, told the RCN radio network on Friday.
   The drugstore was one of a chain belonging to Gilberto
Rodriguez, the reputed leader of the Cali cocaine cartel.
Authorities blamed the Medellin cartel for several bombings of
drugstores in the chain in 1988 and 1989.
   During that time, the two cartels fought a war for control of
the New York City cocaine market.

   Nicaraguan rebels today agreed with
the new government to begin disarming next week, and the President
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro pledged to start reducing the size of
the Sandinista-controlled army. If carried out, the agreement will
mean an end to a decade-old civil war between thousands of
U.S.-backed Contra rebels and the previous leftist Sandinista
government. An estimated 30,000 people have died in the fighting.
   Mrs. Chamorro also said weapons given to civilian Sandinista
supporters by the outgoing administration should be ``recovered and
destroyed.''
   Israel Galeano, the Contra commander, agreed his forces would
begin disarming Tuesday. The accord, which was reached after a
15-hour meeting that ended at 1 a.m. today, said the rebel fighters
would be disarmed by June 10.
   The accord said the security of the rebels and their families
camped with them would be guaranteed.
   The bulk of the rebel army, estimated at between 9,000 and
12,000 fighters, has returned to Nicaragua from Honduran base camps
in the past few months. Many are in security zones supervised by
U.N. peacekeepeers.
   The rebels had previously agreed to surrender their weapons by
June 10 but then stalled, saying they wanted the army to be
disbanded first. The army is controlled by the Sandinista Front,
which lost national elections to Mrs. Chamorro's U.S.-backed
opposition coalition in February.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who is also acting as defense minister, did not
specify by how much the army would be reduced but promised to do so
by the date of the Contra demobilization.
   ``On June 10, we will announce the program of the reduction of
the armed forces ordered in (my) inaugural address of April 25th,
and whose implementation should begin immediately,'' Mrs. Chamorro
said.
   Her government has also forced top officers to leave the party
in a move intended to depoliticize the army.
   Today's announcements followed closed-door talks that began
Friday. Members of Mrs. Chamorro's Cabinet and Nicaragua's Roman
Catholic cardinal, Miguel Obando y Bravo, also attended.
   Galeano said Friday the fact that the Contras were meeting with
Mrs. Chamorro shows a willingness to work to rebuild ``a society
that is destroyed.''
   Many Contras are angry over Mrs. Chamorro's decision to keep
Gen. Humberto Ortega as head of the army, although she said the
post would be temporary. Ortega, brother of former President Daniel
Ortega, had been defense minister under the Sandinistas.
   When Mrs. Chamorro took office April 25, she charged Gen. Ortega
with coming up with a program for reducing the armed forces in
keeping with Contra demands. However, she said Ortega would stay on
as head of the army until the Contras were disarmed.

<TEXT>
   Gay rights activists have demanded
scientific proof from a foundation promoting therapy and sports as
``cures'' for homosexuality.
   Robert Austin, president of the Utah AIDS Coalition, condemned
the notion that sexual orientation can be changed.
   ``Reorientation therapy is to psychiatry what bloodletting is to
the healing arts,'' he said.
   Austin commented Friday as 120 social workers and therapists
gathered for the opening of a two-day conference sponsored by the
Evergreen Foundation, a self-described group of former homosexuals
dedicated to helping others abandon gay lifestyles.
   The foundation touts development of athletic skills to spur the
transition to heterosexuality, but conference organizers conceded
they have no studies to back up their views.
   Instead, they cited anecdotal cases and testimonials from
ex-homosexuals that homosexuality can be cured.
   Jeff Konrad said he was able to change his homosexual
orientation by playing sports and relating to men in a non-sexual
way through a support group.
   ``I was an isolated, shy person and I didn't play baseball,'' he
said. ``A lot of gay men aren't good at sports. I didn't have
enough self-confidence to go after that ball and when the ball
came, I wasn't aggressive. All I needed was love, pushing and a
masculine role model.''
   Joe Dallas of Orange, Calif., a fundamentalist Christian
therapist, told conference goers that while not technically an
illness, homosexuality is a ``symptom of inner conflict'' often
stemming from a childhood devoid of proper male identity
development.
   He said he has helped 70 people achieve significant sexual
reorientation or modified behavior during the last three years.
   ``I need more time, perhaps five to nine years, to do a
follow-up study that would be more credible,'' Dallas said. ``But
none of my clients have renounced our efforts.''
   Austin said the majority of mental health professionals agree
that sexual orientation cannot be changed.
   He predicted that the foundation's year-old treatment program
would ``fall on the ash heap of history,'' joining the notion that
homosexuality is a mental disease _ an idea rejected by the
American Psychiatric Association in 1973.
   ``It will not fall without its victims,'' Austin said. ``Gay and
lesbian teens, haunted by confusion over their affectation, attempt
suicide three times as often as their heterosexual counterparts.
   ``I find the very idea of professionals in the mental health
professions adding to that despair and confusion by offering false
hopes of reorientation to be unconscionable,'' he said.
   Evergreen President Alan Seegmiller said his organization
reflects Christian values, which can sometimes be the force that
prompts homosexuals to seek change. He said 40 to 50 members of the
foundation are members of the Mormon Church, which condemns
homosexuality as a serious sin.
   ``We respect gays who are happy with their lifestyle, but we do
believe that the most complete, actualized person will be
heterosexual,'' he said. ``I see homosexuality as just the red
light on the dash that says check under the hood, something's the
matter here.''
   Austin was joined at a news conference by a minister, a social
worker and several Mormon homosexuals who recounted painful
memories of various treatments that failed.
   Mark Hansen said one Mormon counselor had him hang a poster of a
woman in a string bikini above his bed to change sexual
orientation, while another therapist said to remove the poster
because ``it was wrong to replace one perversion with another
perversion.''
   Still another counselor had Hansen place a pinto bean in his
shoe. He said each time he felt the bean, ``I was told to say to
myself, `I am completely heterosexual.'''
   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, while making
occasional referrals to the program, is not affiliated with the
foundation, said spokesman Don LeFevre.
   ``LDS Social Services professionals view the foundation as a
support group, or resource,'' he said.
   In the late 1960s, church-owned Brigham Young University offered
homosexual students aversion therapy, including electroshock
treatments, but abandoned the experiment ``when it was determined
to be ineffective,'' LeFevre said.
   Now, the church offers individual and group therapy for ``both
those with homosexual orientation and for family members who seek
it. ... It is a spiritually based therapy.''

<TEXT>
   A program that pays farmers to destroy
their coca plants has eliminated more than one-tenth of the
country's acreage this year of the main ingredient in cocaine, U.S.
officials say.
   In April, coca leaf farmers destroyed 2,700 acres of plants,
bringing the total since Dec. 1 to 9,800 acres, the U.S. Embassy
said Friday. That represents over one-tenth of the 94,000 acres
devoted to coca cultivation, it said.
   Farmers receive $2,000 from the Bolivian government for every 2{
acres destroyed.
   But the government says it is having trouble making the payments
because of a faltering economy. Treasury officials indicate the
funding of educational, health and other government programs are
delayed because of payments made to coca leaf farmers.
   The nine-month-old government of President Jaime Paz Zamora is
to meet with President Bush in Washington next week to discuss
cooperation in fighting cocaine trafficking.
   The U.S. government is expected to provide at least $60 million
this year for military and police assistance to combat cocaine
trafficking in Bolivia.
   The voluntary coca eradication program took off late last year
in response to a sharp drop in coca leaf prices brought about by
the Colombian anti-drug crackdown and increased interdiction
activities in Bolivia. The anti-drug crackdown has disrupted
cocaine production and resulted in a glut of coca leaves.
   A 100 pound sack of coca is selling for around $10 while the
cost of production is estimated at $30. A similar weight of leaf
sold for $200 to $300 five years ago.
   Farmers are lining up in front of government offices to sign up
for the coca reduction program and tens of thousands of farmers
have left the Chapare coca leaf producing region in recent months
in response to the sharp drop in coca leaf prices.
   ``The fact that the voluntary eradiction program has begun to
show significant progress proves that interdiction, eradication and
alternative development programs are three interdependent parts of
an integrated strategy and must be pursued simultaneoulsy and with
equal strength,'' U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard said in an
interview.
   The voluntary coca eradication program is taking place in the
Chapare, a lush tropical region in the heart of Bolivia that
produces nearly a third of the world's coca leaves. At least
300,000 farmers depend on coca leaf cultivation and cocaine
production for their livelihood.
   The leaves, which resemble bay leaves, are grown on bushes and
are harvested four times a year. After they are dried they are
macerated with kerosene in plastic covered pits to become paste.
After further processings in labs located in the Bolivian lowlands
as well as in Colombia and Brazil, the paste is transformed into
cocaine.
   The Bolivian government says the country must be developed as a
whole in order to wean farmers away from coca cultivation. Bolivia,
with a population of 7.1 million, is the poorest country and the
largest recepient of U.S. aid in South America.
   At least $300 million enters the Bolivian economy from cocaine
trafficking.

   ``Crocodile Dundee'' star Paul Hogan
married co-star Linda Kozlowski today at the multimillion-dollar
mansion he built for her as a wedding gift.
   In the two Crocodile Dundee movies Hogan, 51, played the
ruggedly handsome character from the outback who fell in love with
an American journalist played by Ms. Kozlowski, 33. He also has
appeared overseas in television commercials promoting Australian
tourism.
   The wedding took place in Byron Bay in far northern New South
Wales state of eastern Australia. Hogan, who started his working
life as a painter on the Sydney bridge, built the $2 million
mansion for his bride as a wedding gift.
   Reporters were banned from the ceremony, which Hogan had said
would be attended by about 100 close friends and family as well as
a ``couple of mates.''
   The community has been buzzing with rumors for the past week
about Hollywood film stars like Sylvester Stallone and Clint
Eastwood flying in for the wedding. Local radio reports claimed
they were seen in the area, but no official announcement was made
about whether they attended.
   Hogan was married twice before _ to the same woman, Noelene.
They separated in 1986 but remarried seven months later before
finally ending their 29 years together. They had five children.
   It was not known if his ex-wife attended, but Hogan said the
children were among the guests. The bride's parents, Maj. and Mrs.
Stan Kozlowski, flew in from California.
   Hogan recently completed ``Almost An Angel,'' a film he wrote
and starred in.

<HEAD>Suspected Guerrilla Fatally Shoots US Soldier Before Bases Talks</HEAD>

   A suspected communist guerrilla
fatally shot a U.S. Marine near an American-run base, prompting
cancellation of off-base leave for all U.S. military personnel in
the country, officials said today.
   The Friday night attack near Subic Naval Base came after
authorities said they had evidence communist guerrillas planned to
kill Americans before talks begin this month on extending the
base's lease.
   Rebels waging a 21-year-old Marxist insurgency are also
suspected of having killed at least 14 people, including a town
mayor, in attacks in the central and southern Philippines since
Thursday.
   Gunnery Sgt. John S. Fredette, 34, of Buena Park, Calif., was
slain in the liberty town of Olongapo near the base, about 50 miles
west of Manila, according to a spokesman for the Subic facility.
   Fredette was assigned to Marine Fighter@Attack Squadron 323,
which is on temporary duty in the Philippines from its base at the
Marine Air Station in El Toro, Calif., said spokesman Petty Officer
John Moore.
   A police investigator, Patrolman Romeo de Guzman, said Fredette
was walking along a sidestreet in Olongapo when one of five
suspected communist New People's Army members shot him once in the
neck with a handgun. The five escaped on foot after the shooting.
   Fredette was rushed to the Subic Base hospital where he died one
hour later, de Guzman added. De Guzman said the killing ``has all
the earmarks'' of a communist assassination but did not elaborate.
   Following the killing, U.S. authorities canceled off-base leave
and non-essential travel for the 40,000 U.S. troops, Defense
Department civilians and military dependents at Subic and the five
other U.S.-run bases throughout the country.
   Last month, the Navy barred most non-essential travel to Manila
but had allowed sailors to visit Olongapo, traditionally among the
safest cities in the Philippines.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt expressed his ``shock and sorrow
at the cowardly murder'' of Fredette, said U.S. Embassy spokeswoman
Victoria Middleton.
   The incident is under investigation by both U.S. naval and
Philippine authorities. A Filipino intelligence officer, who
refused to be identified, said investigators have identified two of
the assailants as rebels operating in the nearby province of Bataan.
   Filipino and U.S. authorities have been concerned after local
military officials reported an alleged member of the communist New
People's Army hit squad was arrested in Olongapo last week and four
other members of the team were still at large.
   Documents seized from the arrested man, Dionisio Bendoy,
indicated a plan by the insurgents to assassinate Americans in the
city before the opening of talks on May 14 on the future of six
U.S. military facilities in the Philippines.
   The United States maintains the Subic base, Clark Air Base and
four other smaller facilities in the country under a 1947 pact that
expires in September 1991. The rebels have demanded the bases be
closed.
   The rebels traditionally have not operated in the Olongapo area
because of strong public support for the bases. Rebels do operate
around Clark Air Base in central Luzon.
   Ms. Middleton said security was tightened at American facilities
in Manila about two months ago because of fears of a rebel attack.
   Last September, guerrillas killed two civilian employees of Camp
O'Donnell, a U.S. Air Force post near Clark.
   In October 1987, communist rebels gunned down three Americans in
simultaneous attacks outside Clark.
   At least three other Americans have been killed elsewhere in the
country in the past four years, including U.S. Army Col. James
``Nick'' Rowe, who was ambushed April last year while on his way to
work in a Manila suburb.

   An actress who posed nude for Playboy with her
twin sister was convicted of evading taxes on $685,000 in cash she
allegedly received from an elderly millionaire for sex.
   Lynnette Harris, 35, was found guilty Friday by a federal court
jury. Her identical twin, Leigh Ann Conley, faces trial June 4 on
tax evasion charges.
   Prosecutors said the sisters received more than $1 million in
cash, houses, furs, cars and other items from Milwaukee businessman
David Kritzik, who died last June at age 89.
   Ms. Harris described the cash as a non-taxable gift during her
testimony. Prosecutors called it income for sexual service. She
would not speak to reporters after the verdict was announced.
   Ms. Harris was convicted of failing to report as income money
she received from Kritzik from 1984 to 1987. The taxes amount to
$260,000, said U.S. Attorney Mel Johnson.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas J. Curran scheduled sentencing for
July 25. Ms. Harris could be sentenced to a maximum 12 years in
prison and fined $625,000. Her lawyer, Dave Geraghty, said the
verdict will be appealed.
   ``She believes in her innocence and so do we. She was very
disappointed,'' Geraghty said.
   The sisters grew up in Milwaukee and attended a girls' parochial
school. Ms. Harris now lives in Mukwonago and Ms. Conley lives in
suburban Glendale.
   The Internal Revenue Service says Ms. Conley owes taxes on
$397,000 from Kritzik, who built a fortune as a merchant, stock
investor and founder of the Treasure Island discount stores that
were eventually sold to J.C. Penney Co. for $11 million.
   The twins posed nude together for a 1981 edition of Playboy and
appeared in two motion pictures, ``Sorceress'' and a remake of ``I,
the Jury.''

<HEAD>Lava Flow Cuts Town In Two</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KALAPANA, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fast-moving flow of sizzling lava from
Kilauea Volcano cut this deserted town in two Friday and raced
toward a final fiery climax with the ocean.
   A portion of the flow, which had moved about a third of a mile
since Thursday night, cut a speeding path around the town's hub.
   Part of the flow was filling up a gully that separated the
molten mass from the Kalapana Store and Drive-In and the Kalapana
Mauna Kea Congregational Church.
   Star of the Sea Church, a Roman Catholic church known as the
``painted church'' because of its colorful murals, was moved,
beating by a few hours a portion of the flow that crossed Highway
137 halfway between the town and Harry K. Brown State Park, a
quarter of a mile away.
   Three more homes burned Friday to boost the count to 134 since
Kilauea began its current eruption in January 1983. Three of the
last families to flee the area managed to move their belongings
before their homes were cut off by the encroaching flow.
   A tractor trailer began moving the church about 7 a.m. Friday.
It was brought to a roadside area where other houses that were
salvaged are located.
   Church officials have not said where the church will be
relocated.
   An elderly native Hawaiian woman pleaded with workers and
officials not to move the church. But Bishop Joseph Ferrario
decided last week to move it to preserve its interior paintings.
   ``How can you move it? How can you move it?'' the woman screamed
at workers preparing to move the church.
   Others echoed similar sentiments.
   ``How can you call it Star of the Sea Church if it isn't by the
sea?'' asked Kapena Kamahele, a Hilo resident whose family has a
long history in Kalapana.
   Kamahele said the destruction of Kalapana, one of the last
vestiges of the ``old style'' Hawaii, was seen by many longtime
residents as the punishment for mistreatment of the land.
   Many of the newer, non-Hawaiian people who moved to the area
failed to understand the Hawaiian village lifestyle that many in
this coastal community held sacred, she said.
   ``We are erasing the chalkboard and starting from scratch,''
Kamahele said. ``Hawaiians will teach all people how to do it.''
   Civil Defense officials ordered members of the Congregational
church who had spent the night in the building to evacuate Friday
morning.
   ``The book is closed. We open a new book today,'' said Bernice
McKeague, church moderator.
   Church members held a prayer vigil Thursday night and watched as
the lava built up in a small gully behind the church.
   The Kalapana Store, the meeting center of the town, remained
standing just like its owner said it would.
   ``Madam Pele (Hawaii's volcano goddess) will never take me,''
said Walter Yamaguchi, the 82-year-old owner. He said he left some
supplies in the store to sell once it reopened.
   However, the flow continued to build behind his store.
   Of increasing concern to authorities was the threat to public
health when the lava begins to fall into the ocean.
   When lava hits the water, it explodes and releases gases
including hydrochloric acid, a strong-smelling chemical that is
quite dangerous, said Civil Defense spokesman Bud Trulson.

   Latvian economists moved quickly today to
bolster the republic's declaration of independence by announcing
plans for a currency that could be traded internationally.
   The republic's legislature on Friday joined neighboring
Lithuania and Estonia in declaring independence from the Soviet
Union, 50 years after the Kremlin annexed the three Baltic
republics. However, Latvia took a more gradual approach than
Lithuania, saying full independence would come only after an
indefinite period of negotiations with Soviet authorities.
   Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov said low-level talks were
expected to begin May 15. ``Everything is ahead,'' he said said
after the vote Friday. ``This is only the very, very beginning.''
   Soviet leaders had no immediate reaction to Latvia's move.
   Gorbunov said at an evening news conference that the Latvian
government had received a proposal from Estonian President Arnold
Ruutel to start immediate coordinated actions on the two republics'
drives for independence.
   Economists of the new Latvia Fund today told a news conference
in Riga, the republican capital, that work was under way to restore
the pre-Soviet Latvian currency, the lat.
   The fund, created last month, plans to immediately issue bonds
and lottery tickets that can be sold abroad for $11 million to
finance the creation and printing of the new currency, they said.
   The lat may enter circulation _ coexisting with the
non-convertible Soviet ruble _ as early as next year, fund members
predicted.
   ``This is not theory. This is a concrete step to independence,''
said Jazeps Barkans, director of Latvian television and a fund
member.
   In addition to voting 138-0 vote for independence, Latvian
lawmakers also decided on Friday to drop the words ``Soviet
Socialist'' from the republic's name, making it simply ``The
Republic of Latvia.''
   Their call for a gradual break with the Soviet Union, however,
contrasted with the Lithuanian decision on March 11 to declare
complete independence.
   Gorbunov said he could not predict what the Soviets would say,
but he added that the Latvian government had tried to make it clear
that there is ``no cause to close the door on dialogue and start
setting ultimatums.''
   Fifty-seven anti-independence lawmakers refused to cast ballots
in the assembly of just under 200 members. Even so, the measure had
no problem achieving the two-thirds majority needed for approval.
   After the vote was announced, Latvians inside and outside the
hall broke into a chorus of ``God Bless Latvia,'' the republic's
traditional anthem. A cheering crowd showered emerging lawmakers
with roses, pansies and daffodils. Latvians danced in the streets
of Riga.
   ``I waited my whole life for this,'' said Ilma Kaminska, 65, who
said she remembered when Latvia was forcibly annexed by Soviet
dictator Joseph Stalin in 1940. ``I believed, I always believed,''
she said with tears in her eyes.
   However, about 300 people gathered on Riga's Cathedral Square
this morning to hear speakers mounted on an army truck say the
independence declaration was illegal and should be revoked. The
rally was organized by Interfront, which includes ethnic Russians
and other non-Latvian residents.
   The independence bill was championed by the pro-independence
Latvian People's Front that dominates the parliament.
   The neighboring republic of Estonia took a similar step March 30.
   Lithuania, which declared full independence, is now suffering
from a Kremlin-imposed economic blockade of oil, natural gas and
other raw materials.
   In his comments Friday, Gorbunov said Latvia could offer its
solidarity but had few resources for economic help.
   In Washington, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene
appealed on Friday for Western backing. She said a strong
declaration of support could be decisive in Lithuania's drive.
   She said she continues to hope that President Bush and other
world leaders can yet be persuaded that embracing independence for
Lithuania and its Baltic neighbors will not undermine Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his program of political and
economic reform.

   Students at universities around the country protested the
exclusion of homosexuals from the Reserve Officers' Training Corps,
and an assembly at one school threatened to withhold credit for
ROTC courses.
   The activities Friday at 25 campuses were coordinated by
students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
   At the University of Kansas, the school senate proposed that
ROTC courses no longer be counted for credit toward graduation
until the Department of Defense changes its policy of banning
homosexuals from earning military commissions through the program.
   The policy prohibits gay students from entering the ROTC, though
they make take ROTC courses.
   The Lawrence, Kan., school's senate, two-thirds faculty and
one-third students, said the proposal would go into effect next
year, pending approval by Chancellor Gene Budig, unles the ROTC
policy is reversed.
   The senate also passed a motion to ban ROTC from holding
commissioning ceremonies on university property until the issue is
resolved.
   University of Washington students in Seattle adopted a
resolution calling on the school's regents to lobby the state's
congressional delegation to help change the discriminatory law.
   ``These students may be just as disciplined and capable as any
other soldier, sailor, pilot or officer, but because of their
sexual preference or orientation, they are barred from serving in
the armed forces,'' students association president Heidi Wills said.
   ``This is treating a segment ... of our student body as
second-class citizens,'' she said.
   Declarations also were made Friday at Northwestern, the
University of California at Los Angeles and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, among other schools.
   About 20 Ohio State University students gathered outside the
administration building to protest the presence of ROTC on the
campus. Students carried signs including one that read, `The Few.
The Proud. The Gay.''
   ``ROTC is such a big part of this campus, and they won't let us
in. The university is hypocritical and needs to live up to their
stated policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation,''
said Mike Scarce, vice president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance.

<TEXT>
   An American Peace Corps volunteer and three relief
workers were kidnapped by Liberian rebels as they inspected refugee
centers along the Liberian-Guinean border, a French relief agency
has said.
   The American, David Kelley, was checking water supplies at a
Liberian village when he was kidnapped on Tuesday, said Marc
Gastellu-Epchjorry, a spokesman for Doctors Without Borders.
Kelley's hometown was not known.
   Also abducted were Ludovic Pichrist, a logistics expert from the
group's Belgian chapter; Werner Will of West Germany; and a
Guinean, Naiankoye Kolie, Gastellu-Epchjorry said Friday.
   The State Department reported the abductions but did not
identify the victims.
   Kolie was freed on Friday, and he reached Guinean authorities,
the spokesman said.
   ``He said the other three are in good health, but the rebels
want to interrogate them,'' said Gastellu-Epchjorry.
   He did not know when or where the three Westerners might be
released or what the subject of interrogtion might be.
   The three were checking water sanitation at border villages
where more than 100,000 people have sought refuge from fighting
between the rebels and troops loyal to President Samuel K. Doe of
Liberia.
   The French and Belgian chapters of Doctors Without Borders have
sent 16 people to the region to vaccinate refugees and assure the
quality of their water supplies to prevent epidemics.
   The rebels have previously captured other Westerners and held
them for several days before releasing them.
   Fighting between the rebels and Liberian government troops broke
out Dec. 24 in northeastern Nimba County, and humanitarian groups
estimate hundreds of rebels and scores of soldiers have been
killed. About 250,000 refugees have fled to other parts of Liberia
and to Guinea and Ivory Coast.
   Washington is a staunch supporter of Doe, who seized power in a
bloody 1980 coup from the descendants of freed U.S. slaves who
founded Liberia in 1847.
   But about 400 of the 500 American personnel and their dependents
have left Liberia in recent days as rebel forces have moved to
within striking distance of the capital, Monrovia, the State
Department has said.
   Officials last week described the exodus not as an evacuation
but an ``authorized voluntary departure.''
   Before the departures got under way, there were about 5,000
Americans in Liberia. There are no precise figures available on the
number Americans in unofficial capacities who have left.

   Marla Maples may have to wait a while longer to
see her name on the marquee instead of in supermarket tabloid
headlines.
   The so-called other woman in the marital wrangling of Donald and
Ivana Trump auditioned for Madonna's role in the national tour of
the Broadway show ``Speed-the-Plow.'' But she didn't get it.
   ``Marla was actually quite good,'' Gene Wolsk, a co-producer,
told The New York Times. ``But even before we came to any decision,
her people asked about the length of the tour and she was hesitant
about committing herself for that period of time.''
   Ms. Maples has had a couple of bit parts in movies and has done
some modeling.
   Madonna starred as an office temp working for two Hollywood
producers in playwright David Mamet's ``Speed-the-Plow,'' a
scathing look at greed in the film industry.
   Brooke Shields has also been mentioned as a possibility for the
role originally played by Madonna. But Wolsk told the Times the
producers were now thinking about casting an actress who did not
necessarily have ``a name.''

<TEXT>
   NATO and Warsaw Pact countries say they
will not be able to reach agreement by next week as planned on
terms for monitoring each other's airspace, according to news
reports today.
   However, both sides still hope for an accord this year, the
reports said.
   About 250 experts from the countries are meeting in Budapest for
a second round of talks in the so-called Open Skies conference.
   The conference is intended to build trust between the two
military blocs by opening their skies to surveillance flights that
would allow other countries to monitor their military activities.
   At the first round of talks in Ottawa, Canada, in February, the
participants set a tentative May 12 deadline for signing an accord
by the foreign ministers of the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact
nations.
   Tibor Toth, head of the Hungarian delegation to the talks, said
it now appeared certain the two sides would not be able to reach
agreement by then, the daily Nepszabadsag reported.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators said last week they did not expect
the conference to meet its deadline, citing ``major outstanding
problems'' that still needed to be resolved. But they, too, have
said they would like to see an accord signed by the end of the year.
   There is already agreement that the size of a country should
determine how many surveillance flights it is allotted.
   But the United States and the Soviet Union disagree on a number
of key issues, including the type of plane and equipment used and
how information obtained from the flights should be used.
   The Soviet Union would like the information to be pooled, but
the United States wants information sharing to be voluntary.

   Police raided the headquarters of
South Korea's second largest broadcast network and seized a
fugitive union leader.
   In other labor unrest, dozens of workers came down from a crane
where they had been conducting a sit-down strike at a shipyard in
southern Korea.
   About 100 riot troopers stormed into the main office of the
Munhwa Broadcasting Co. shortly before midnight Friday, surrounded
the network's union office, and hauled away union leader Chun
Young-il. Scuffles occurred between a dozen MBC workers and police
officers, but no injuries were reported.
   Chun, a 38-year-old union leader from the nation's largest
broadcast network, KBS, had stayed in the nearby MBC building since
police stormed the KBS headeuarters on Monday.
   About 1,000 MBC workers have staged a sympathy strike to support
KBS workers, who were demanding the resignation of their new
government-appointed chief. They consider the new boss an opponent
of reform efforts in South Korea.
   Police have been searching for union leaders accused of
organizing recent labor protests at the KBS network, factories and
the Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. shipyard in the southern city of
Ulsan.
   Labor protests in South Korea died down today, a national
holiday for the Children's Day. However, thousands of riot police
remained on alert around the Hyundai shipyard, where some workers
remained on strike.
   Relatives persuaded dozens of workers holed up on top of a
240-foot crane at the shipyard to end their sit-in today. Another
19 exhausted workers came down on Friday. There have been
contradictory reports on the number of the workers on the crane,
but police believe more than 50, including several union leaders
wanted by police, are still there.
   Police prepared nets and air mattresses at the shipyard to
prevent suicide attempts by the workers remaining on the crane.
   The workers climbed the crane a week ago when thousands of
police firing tear gas raided the world's largest shipyard to quell
a three-day strike demanding the release of jailed union leaders.
The police raid triggered sympathy strikes at other Hyundai
subsidiaries in Ulsan and other cities.

<HEAD>Saudi Prince Seeks Reconciliation With Syria, Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crown Prince Abdallah bin Abdul Aziz of
Saudi Arabia arrived today for talks with Syrian leaders on ending
a long-standing rift with Iraq and forging a new Arab unity.
   Damascus is the prince's first stop on a tour of key Arab
capitals amid efforts to mediate a rapprochement between Syria and
Iraq and to convene an emergency Arab summit in the Iraqi capital,
Baghdad.
   Abdallah is also scheduled to visit Baghdad and Cairo.
   He also is expected to try to end the 7-year-old feud between
President Hafez Assad and Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman Yasser Arafat. In 1983, Syrian-backed radical Palestinian
factions mutinied and drove PLO forces out of their last Lebanese
stronghold.
   Ending these rifts would overcome the last major obstacles to
organizing the strongest show of Arab unity in decades. It would
also open the way for a Baghdad summit later this month.
   Last month, Arafat called for a Baghdad summit to discuss the
massive emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel and other pressing
Middle East issues.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein wants to host the summit and show
that the Arab world supports him amid what he views as a
concentrated Western campaign against Iraq's drive to build up its
military arsenal.
   The United States and Britain say authorities intercepted
nuclear trigger devices and components for a huge ``super gun'' as
they were being smuggled from Britain to Iraq. Experts believe the
gun would have been capable of firing chemical weapons at Israel.
   Saddam claims the Western effort is aimed at setting the stage
for an Israeli attack on Iraq's burgeoning military installations.
   The Saudi envoy's visit to Damascus coincided with a visit to
Baghdad by King Hussein of Jordan to persuade Saddam to reconcile
with Syria's Assad.
   But the Syrian president told visiting Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on Thursday that he will not attend the Baghdad summit
because he was not consulted in advance.
   Arab League sources said the 22-member organization's
secretary-general, Chadli Bendjedid, plans to visit Damascus to
persuade Syria to attend.
   Prince Abdallah is also chairman of an Arab League committee
assigned to ``clear pan-Arab obstacles.'' The committee, formed at
the 1982 Arab summit in Morocco was instrumental in promoting a
rapprochement between Syria and Jordan.
   Syria and Egypt recently resumed ties, taking Arabs a step
closer to the unity that has eluded them for decades. Libya has
also moved toward patching up its differences with Egypt.
   Most Arab nations broke relations with Cairo over its 1979 peace
treaty with Israel. But Egypt has gradually re-established ties
with most Arab nations since 1987 when an Arab summit welcomed it
back into the Arab fold.
   In addition, Syria and Jordan improved relations in 1985 after
years of dispute. Last year, Syria restored ties with Morocco that
were broken in 1986.
   And Marxist South Yemen and conservative North Yemen are
striving toward unity after a 20-year split.

   A train carrying about 200 passengers left
the rails and tumbled into a dry riverbed in southern Oaxaca state,
killing at least six people and injuring 40, the Mexican Red Cross
said.
   The relief organization originally had said that at least 40
people died in Thursday night's crash. But Ana Maria Tovar, local
director of the Red Cross, reduced the death toll on Friday and
said the mistake occurred because the crash site was isolated and
the accident occurred at night.
   A news release from the Mexican National Railroad put the toll
at seven dead and 20 injured.
   The second-class train, The Oaxacan, was en route from Oaxaca to
Mexico City when it left the tracks, apparently because of brake
failure. The derailment occurred at Cuicatlan village.
   No foreigners were reported aboard.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher today dismissed Soviet objections to NATO membership for a
united Germany as he opened unification talks with the World War II
Allies.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, however,
acknowledged that other nations have ``legitimate interests'' that
may need to be addressed.
   In addition to the Soviet objections, Poland wants assurances
that Germany will not claim any Polish land that was German
territory prior to World War II.
   Genscher, Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze joined their counterparts from Britain, France and
East Germany for the first such top-level talks on uniting the
Germanys.
   The six diplomats gathered this morning at the Foreign Ministry
in Bonn.
   Final decisions were not expected from the meeting, held just 3{
weeks before the start of the U.S.-Soviet summit in Washington.
   East Germany's Markus Meckel, a pastor and former janitor turned
foreign minister, was the first to arrive in a black Mercedes-Benz.
   Chatting with each other, the men stood in a row and posed for
photographers, with Baker and Shevardnadze constantly side by side.
   At the heart of the talks is the Soviet refusal to accept a
united Germany in NATO. The Soviets have called for a neutral
Germany, and Shevardnadze said today Moscow remained opposed to
NATO membership for a united Germany, according to ADN, East
Germany's government-run news agency. He said such an arrangement
would be ``incompatible with Soviet security interests,'' it said.
   ``The foreign minister asked his counterparts at the table for
understanding,'' ADN reported.
   Baker and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd tried to ease
the Soviet fears, said a British official who briefed reporters on
condition of anonymity.
   He quoted Hurd as saying, ``We are seeing a changing NATO. We
are moving away from the vocabulary of the Cold War.''
   ``We have difficult problems to solve,'' Genscher said in his
opening remarks after they had sat down at a round table inside the
Foreign Ministry's main conference room. ``However, if we are all
willing not only to defend our own interests but also to respect
the interests of our partners, then we will find solutions.''
   Genscher started his remarks, distributed to reporters
beforehand, by calling to mind the ``immeasurable suffering''
caused by World War II and the Nazi dictatorship.
   He also mentioned the Helsinki Final Act regulating relations
among European countries, as he rebuffed Moscow's opposition to a
unified Germany in the U.S.-led Atlantic Alliance.
   ``The Final Act emphasizes quite distinctly that all principles
are of primary significance,'' Genscher said. ``In this connection,
I refer to the principle of sovereign equality, which gives all
participating states the right to be or not to be a party to
treaties of alliance.''
   ``Since we know that the Western alliance, adapting itself as it
does to the changes in Europe, brings about peace and security, a
free-standing united Germany would be of no benefit to Europe,'' he
added.
   Baker and Hurd echoed Genscher's position that it was for the
Germans alone to decide whether they want to belong to an alliance.
   Baker said in his opening statement the United States and the
other Allied powers that carved up Germany after the Nazi defeat 45
years ago should not impose special restrictions on a united
Germany, thereby ``planting seeds of future instability.''
   ``Today we engage in an act of reconcialition _ of a people too
long separated, of a continent too long divided,'' Baker said.
   Shevardnadze was conciliatory in his statement, according to the
British official. ``He accepted entirely the self-determination of
the German people,'' the official said.
   Neither Shevardnadze nor Baker dwelled on Germany's Nazi past.
   ``We don't want a discussion on obsolete views,'' the British
official quoted Shevardnadze as saying.
   Baker said, ``We face the challenge of rising above the past.''
   The British official said French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas
called for Poland to become involved in the unification talks at
the third meeting of the foreign ministers, to be held in Paris. A
date has not been set.
   While Genscher has said a united Germany will be in NATO, he
also has offered to let the Soviets keep some of their troops in
what is now East Germany for a transitional period.
   About 250,000 U.S. troops are stationed in West Germany, with an
estimated 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany.

   Hooded gunmen opened fire on a crowd
attending a wedding reception Saturday, killing seven people and
wounding four others, the state-run news agency reported.
   The shooting occurred at 5 a.m. in San Carlos City in Pangasinan
province, 100 miles northwest of Manila, the Philippine News Agency
said.
   The agency quoted San Carlos police station chief Capt. Juanito
Mangonon as saying the gunmen raked the wedding reception with
automatic gunfire shortly after the groom and the bride left for
the wedding ceremony at a Roman Catholic church, a few miles away.
   The assailants were apparently after one of the guests but
opened fire on the people preparing the wedding reception after
failing to find their target, Mangonon said.
   The gunmen fled on foot after the shooting.

   Robbers held a businessman and his

foundry, then stole more than $250,000 worth of gold, police said
Saturday.
   Five gunmen broke into the isolated suburban villa of Jean-Luc
Escard on Friday evening and held his wife, 3-year-old daughter and
mother-in-law captive while awaiting his return from his business
in Marseille, police said.
   Escard was overpowered when he arrived and was struck several
times before telling the robbers the combinations of safes at his
business, police said. Two robbers went to his office, taking Mrs.
Escard with them to dismantle an alarm system, stole the gold, then
returned to the villa to drop off the woman and flee in Escard's
car with their colleagues.
   Police said detectives had made little progress in their
investigation.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will withdraw 26,800 troops from
Mongolia by the end of this year, the Soviet military commander in
Ulan Bator said Saturday.
   The Soviets in March promised to pull out all of their estimated
60,000 troops by 1992, with planned withdrawal of main combat units
in 1991 and equipment support units the following year.
   Lt. Gen. Mayorov was quoted by the official Chinese news agency,
Xinhua, as saying during a news conference in the Mongolian capital
of Ulan Bator that the troop withdrawal would begin May 15 and end
in August.
   The troops include a motorized-infantry division and several air
units. The Soviets will also pull out 436 tanks, 375 cannon, 400
armored cars and over 5,930 other weapons, Xinhua said.
   The Soviets will turn over 55 barracks and seven airports to the
Mongolians, and its remaining troops will leave by the end of 1992,
Mayorov said.
   The withdrawal is part of an effort to improve relations with
China and to cut the Soviet defense budget. Soviet troop withdrawl
has been one of the demands of Mongolian opposition groups.

<HEAD>Panel Studies 1988 Election, Says Voters Didn't Do Their Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters surrendered to apathy or uncritical
acceptance of George Bush's campaign ads in the 1988 presidential
election, a political study panel concludes.
   ``American voters today do not seem to understand their rightful
place in the operation of American democracy,'' the panel said in a
report Saturday. ``They act as if they believe that presidential
elections belong to somebody else, most notably presidential
candidates and their handlers.''
   The panel _ eight figures from politics, the media, political
science and public policy analysis _ spent two years on the
project. They used polls, focus group interviews and analysis of
news coverage of the election.
   ``Folks have basically checked out,'' said Bruce Buchanan,
executive director of the panel and associate professor of
government at the University of Texas.
   The panel was assembled by the Markle Foundation, which studies
the role of mass communications in a democratic society.
   Two months before the election, a third of the people could not
name Dan Quayle as Bush's running mate, and nearly a half couldn't
name Lloyd Bentsen as Michael Dukakis' would-be vice president,
Buchanan said.
   Just weeks before the election, 22 percent still could not name
Quayle and 30 percent could not identify Bentsen, he said.
   Moreover, the group said, most citizens did not inform
themselves well enough to be able to recognize mistruths in the
Bush campaign's paid advertising.
   ``When we asked voters what they had learned about each
candidate, particularly Dukakis, they said they `learned' that he
was willing to furlough convicted murderers and had no concern
about the pollution of Boston Harbor,'' Buchanan said. ``What they
didn't know was the extent to which the advertising squared with a
reasonable construction of the facts.''
   The panel also blamed the news media and the candidates
themselves for what it called a failure to live up their
responsibilities.
   Most coverage, especially on television, concentrated on the
``horse race'' aspects of the election _ who is leading _ and the
personalities of the contestants, rather than the candidates'
qualifications or the issues.
   Even when the news focused on campaign advertising, it
emphasized the ``guile'' of the Republicans' commercials and the
ineffectiveness of the Democrats' rather than the veracity of the
claims, the commission said.
   The panel expressed dismay at the turnout _ 50.1 percent of
eligible voters actually cast ballots, the lowest percentage in 64
years.
   ``Even as enthusiasm for democracy ignites around the globe, it
is waning in the very nation whose political traditions inspire
others,'' the panel said.
   The panel called for congressional pressure for
institutionalized candidate debates and free air time to educate
voters. It said the news media should ``assume a more substantive
role in seeking the truth in candidate claims in advertising'' and
should overcome candidates' ``attempts to misuse the media.''
   The panel also called for keeping polls open for 20 hours on
election day, for eliciting broadcasters' cooperating in not
projecting winners until the polls are closed everywhere and for
simpler registration procedures.
   Members of the panel were Robert O'Neil, president of the
University of Virginia, chairman; James David Barber, Duke
University political scientist; former Sens. John C. Culver,
D-Iowa, and Charles Mathias, R-Md.; Joan Konner, dean of the
Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism; Eugene
Patterson, editor emeritus of the St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times; and
Eddie N. Williams, president of the Joint Center for Policy Studies.

<HEAD>Investigation Shows Thousands Are Victims of Phony Health Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Americans face as much as $500
million in unpaid medical bills because they relied on thinly
funded and often fraudulent health plans that collapsed, according
to a published report.
   A three-month investigation by the Gannett News Service found
that many of the defunct health plans were the work of con artists
who preyed on small businesses and their employees.
   Some failures can be blamed on business errors and
mismanagement, the investigation found, but others resulted because
the plan operators paid themselves big salaries and ran up huge
expense accounts, then quit paying claims and moved on.
   State and federal authorities, including postal inspectors, the
Office of Labor Racketeering and the FBI, are pursuing civil and
criminal investigations of dozens of health plans across the
country, Gannett said.
   At least two federal indictments already have been handed up,
and more are expected over the next few months, the report said.
   The Senate Investigations subcommittee chaired by Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., has scheduled hearings on the problem for May 14-15.
   The Gannett investigation found that while many victims were
left without health coverage, the plans provided handsome
lifestyles for their operators.
   For example, Michael Rubell and James Helm, owners of Rubell
Helm Insurance Services of Irvine, Calif., which owes millions in
unpaid claims in Florida, Texas and California, took $7,100-a-week
salaries, Gannett said.
   Rubell and Helm's tailor got $115,000 in company funds in less
than a year, the newspaper chain said, citing court documents in a
lawsuit brought by California against the pair. They declined to
talk to Gannett for the story.
   By contrast, many victims are of modest means, such as teachers,
service station attendants and textile mill workers. They work for
small employers _ sometimes the owner and family members are the
only people covered _ who find it nearly impossible to get
affordable health insurance coverage.
   ``The groups of people who are victimized are the ones who can
least afford the hit,'' said Norman Transeth, a Labor Department
investigator looking into health insurance fraud.
   For instance, Richard Flaherty was awaiting double bypass heart
surgery at a hospital in Sparks, Nev., last June when word came
that health insurance coverage sold through his trade association
wasn't any good.
   A retired service station operator, Flaherty still owes about
$120,000 in medical bills. His insurance claim is part of a federal
lawsuit to settle the dispute over who should pay the bills.
   The health plans that have collapsed in recent years are known
collectively as Multiple Employer Trusts or Multiple Employer
Welfare Arrangements. They cover employees of a group of companies,
usually small businesses.
   Unlike traditional health plans provided by large companies,
labor unions and government, METs and MEWAs often are not fully or
even partly covered by insurance firms. And because regulations are
lax, the Gannett investigation showed, the plans seldom are
required to hold reserves against losses.
   Instead, they rely on monthly contributions to cover claims and
operating expenses. But in many cases, Gannett found, expenses are
inflated and premiums are kept low to attract participants. When
claims exceed expectations, the plans cannot pay.
   ``All too many of these are nothing more than Ponzi schemes,''
said Raymond Maria, acting Labor Department inspector general, who
is working to expose what he calls ``a burgeoning problem of
fraud.''
   In a Ponzi scheme, current income is used to pay off previous
investors; when new investments slow and income declines, the
scheme collapses.

<HEAD>London No Longer No. 1 in Phone Books</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   London telephones jangle to new numbers on Sunday,
when area codes 71 and 81 replace the simple No. 1.
   If only it were that simple.
   ``I am totally confident that all the necessary adjustments will
be made as planned on Sunday,'' said Millie Banerjee, general
manager of British Telecom's London network.
   She was speaking only for the company, not the customer.
   British Telecom is ready for up to 50,000 misdialed calls per
minute, and has prepared recorded messages in the appropriate
languages to intercept international calls placed with the wrong
number.
   For international callers, London numbers will be preceded by
the country code, 44, and either 71 or 81 depending on location in
the city.
   Callers within Britain will be dialing 071 or 081 instead of 01.
   With Britain enjoying a three-day weekend, the real test won't
come until Tuesday when banks, exchanges and businesses reopen.
   Telecom says London is the foreign city that receives the most
calls from the United States _ up to 100,000 a day.
   Because of the proliferation of fax machines and direct-dial
business systems that assign a telephone number to every desk,
Telecom said it had used up nearly all the potential 5 million
numbers in the old London exchange.
   Splitting the city will double the pool.
   The 71 code has been assigned to inner London, within
approximately 4 miles of Charing Cross, and 81 to the outer reaches.
   John Turner, Telecom's communications manager for the code
change, said Friday that as many as one-fourth of the 380,000
businesses in London had not reprogrammed their telephones or fax
machines.
   David Fletcher, chief executive of the British Security Industry
Association, estimated that as many as one-fourth of the capital's
100,000 burglar alarms had not been adjusted to contact the new
numbers.
   Some people are upset by the change. Many believe that
self-esteem and property values are bound to decline in areas with
the 81 code such as Finchley, Hornsey, Shepherds Bush, Hammersmith,
Wembley, Putney and Tooting.
   Elsie Burch Donald, author of ``Debrett's Etiquette and Modern
Manners,'' laid down the law a year ago: ``071 will be a superior
number to have. Clearly there is an advantage socially, culturally,
economically to be living in central London.''
   Judging from letters to London newspapers, however, the new
telephone numbers are being taken in stride. Only one gripe was
noted in the major papers last week.
   ``We'll be 081, and nobody gives a damn,'' said Elaine Howard,
manager of a real estate office in Blackheath. ``I have heard it
will make a difference to the market, but so far it's all rumor.''
   The change should be simple for Britons accustomed to wrestling
with Telecom's maddening provincial directories, which list
telephone numbers and city codes in separate sections.
   If you're dialing a number in Piddletrenthide, for instance, you
find the number in the white pages and the city code in the pink _
03004 for three-digit numbers or 0300 for six-digit numbers.
   Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of the Office of
Telecommunications, advised spending a few moments to prepare.
   Change your personal telephone lists, reprogram that push-button
telephone, check that fax machine, lay in a supply of stick-on
labels to correct obsolete stationery, he urged.
   ``Sir Bryan,'' according to a statement released by his office,
``wishes the telephone operating companies, and you, the
all-important customers, a successful changeover to the new London
numbering scheme.''

<TEXT>
   The place of honor in ``the church of the
presidents'' is not in the front row but back toward the cheap
seats.
   Pew 54 at St. John's Church is where George and Barbara Bush sit
when they visit the landmark building across Lafayette Square from
the White House, as they often do on Sundays when they are in
Washington.
   Every president since James Madison has worshipped in the yellow
Episocopal church at least once, and it was Madison himself who
choose Pew 54 as the president's row.
   The Rev. John C. Harper, pastor of St. John's since 1963, savors
the symbolism of America's president being seated ``in the midst of
the people'' instead of the front pew.
   The Bushes are at Camp David, Md., this weekend so they will not
be on hand for a service Sunday at which the presiding bishop of
the Episcopal Church, Edmond Browning, will lead the parish in
celebrating its 175th anniversary.
   But Harper provided a taste of St. John's history for the Bushes
and the few dozen others who turned out for the 8 a.m. communion
service last Sunday.
   He called St. John's, nestled between the headquarters of the
AFL-CIO and the Veterans Affairs Department, ``a symbol of small
power amid great power ... a reminder that not all of the things in
this life are large.''
   The yellow stucco church was designed by Benjamin Henry Latrobe,
the same architect who oversaw the construction of the U.S. Capitol
and the rebuilding of the White House after it was burned by the
British in the War of 1812.
   The cornerstone was laid in 1815 and the first services held a
few years later. Shortly thereafter, the congregation decided to
expand the compact, cross-shaped Byzantine structure, and a nave,
belltower and columned porch were added.
   Not that all the services were packed. John Adams complained in
his diary after returning from a service in 1828: ``There were
scarcely 30 persons in the house. The neglect of public worship in
this city is an increasing evil.''
   Although they frequently attend St. John's, the Bushes remain on
the parish roll of another Episcopal church, St. Martin's, in their
hometown of Houston.
   The Harvard-educated Harper, a New England contemporary of
Bush's, has seen seven presidents during his 27 years at St.
John's. John F. Kennedy attended his installation in 1963 _ and sat
in the front pew.
   Lyndon Johnson slipped into the church for prayer in November
1963, the day after Kennedy's assassination. Gerald Ford worshipped
there frequently. Ronald Reagan attended services on the mornings
of his two inaugurations _ and on Sunday, March 29, 1981, the day
before he was wounded in an assassination attempt.
   Bush and Dan Quayle both showed up for a prayer service on the
morning of their inaugurations last year.
   Harper, in an interview, said of preaching before a president,
``I don't want to sound blase, but it's no big deal. ... I've never
tailored my sermons to whoever is coming.''
   A literary man and onetime English teacher, Harper also does not
thunder over affairs of state.
   ``It's not my style. I'm a pastoral preacher. I'm not a
prophetic preacher,'' he said.
   ``When I was called here to be rector, I remember saying to the
vestry, `You really don't want me. What you ought to have in that
pulpit is somebody who can make the headlines of The Washington
Post on Monday morning ... someone like Bishop Pike.' They said ,
`Oh, no, no, no. we don't,''' he recalled.
   Instead, they got what Harper called a ``garden-variety pastor''
who has succeeded in building the congregation's rolls to more than
1,000 and reducing the average age of the vestry to 43.
   ``When I came here they (the vestry) were all members of the
Metropolitan Club, as a symbol of power. My guess is now maybe a
quarter of them might be. I consider that great progress,'' said
Harper, himself a member in good standing of the elite club.
   Harper prides himself on being non-partisan.
   He ascribes to some advice a friend once gave him.
   It's fine to be called ``the church of the presidents,'' the
friend counseled, but ``be sure that you're never known as `the
church of the president.'''

   Twenty gunmen in camouflage uniforms
robbed tourists and local residents in a midnight raid on a resort
hotel that left some guests with only their pajamas, police said
Saturday.
   Attacks on foreigners have been rare in Sri Lanka, despite
ethnic and political strife that has claimed more than 17,000 lives
in seven years.
   The raid also occurred as tourism in Sri Lanka, once badly
affected by the violence, had been picking up recently.
   The robbers escaped early Saturday with $25,000 worth of
cameras, jewelry, clothing and cash in the raid on the Sigiriya
Village Hotel located in a jungle near archaeological ruins 95
miles northeast of Colombo, the police said.
   No injuries were reported, but some guests were left with only
their nightclothes. The nationalities and number of the guests were
not immediately known, but police said 32 of the hotel's 100 rooms
were occupied.

   Change comes slowly to this Old South town

signs of spring.
   There are no signs of racial division among the 760 students at
modern, red-brick Eufala High School. Sixty percent are white, but
the president of the student body and president of the 180-member
senior class are black, as are the basketball and football
homecoming queens.
   But when it comes time to don formal gowns and rented tuxedoes
for the annual junior-senior affair, white students go to one
dance, blacks to another. Both are sponsored by private groups, not
the school itself.
   ``I think we're the only school in Alabama that does this. We're
the only one in America, I hope,'' said senior class president
James Samuel, who is bound for the U.S. Air Force Academy after
graduation.
   ``They seem to think that if we go to dances together, there
will be racial flareups, a fight,'' said Carmen Campbell, 18, a
white senior and friend of Samuel.
   Community leaders say the southeast Alabama city of about 14,000
still has segregated proms even though the public school system was
integrated 20 years ago after years of maintaining separate schools
for blacks and whites.
   Superintendent Dan Parker said the school district got out of
the dance business completely four years earlier, but he denied
race was the reason.
   ``Alcohol usually gets to be a problem,'' said Parker, who has
headed the 2,900-student system since 1978. ``They leave, get
drunk, and then come back. Why should the board or teachers have to
assume liability for that?''
   Opponents of segregated proms claim the white-controlled school
board uses worries over liquor and liability to dodge the issue of
mixed-race dances.
   The school system also refuses to sponsor homecoming dances and
sock-hops. An ROTC banquet planned for late May will be the first
school-sanctioned social event in about two decades, officials said.
   ``If the whites don't want to have a prom with the blacks, you
can't make them, and vice versa,'' said W.D. Moorer, a school board
member since the 1950s. ``I don't think it's been a big issue, but
it might be now.''
   School board president Billy Houston called holding two proms
``a case of individual preference by the students.''
   Eufaula's annual white prom is sponsored by a group called Youth
Enterprises, whose president, Marie Houston, is Houston's daughter.
   The whites' dance is May 19 at Lakepoint State Park Resort on
the banks of Lake Eufaula. The black prom, put on by Young Blacks
in Action, is May 26 at Lakepoint.
   A group of black parents last went before the school board about
three years ago asking it to sponsor a joint prom, but neither the
board nor the administration took up the idea.
   ``We have gone to the Board of Education, the superintendent of
education and the principal, and they just give us the
run-around,'' said Rose Jordan of the local chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Nearly all the seniors at a class meeting last fall cheered when
Samuel suggested holding a single prom, Miss Campbell said.
   Wayne Fiquett, in his first year as principal at Eufaula High
School, said he has talked with students and faculty about holding
an integrated prom in 1991. Several teachers were ``very willing''
to chaperone.
   Parker said student support for a joint, school-sponsored prom
might not be enough to win the school board's approval.
   ``The senior class might be 90 percent in favor of going to the
Bahamas, too, or abortion, or all coming to school naked, but that
doesn't mean we're going to do it,'' he said. ``Children learn from
experiences, but the school system cannot provide all of life's
experiences.''

<HEAD>Lawsuit Claims Paper Invades Privacy By Publishing Divorce Lists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Newport newspaper's inconspicuous list of
divorces could become a test of a state's right to bar public
information from being reported by the news media.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to say whether states can put
off-limits otherwise public information by invoking privacy
concerns _ and a Newport divorce lawyer contends Rhode Island's
privacy law is such a shield.
   Attorney Thomas W. Kelly is suing The Newport Daily News on
behalf of a woman who wants to keep her name out of the newspaper's
monthly listing of divorces granted in Newport County Family Court.
   ``The Supreme Court has opened the door for the first time,''
said Kelly, citing its June 1989 ruling clearing The Florida Star
newspaper after it published the name of a rape victim despite
state law against such publication.
   The paper was not not liable for invasion of privacy, the high
court ruled, but said there might be a ``zone of personal privacy
within which the state may protect the individual from intrusion by
the press.''
   Rhode Island's 10-year-old privacy law provides the right to be
secure from ``unreasonable publicity'' of a fact ``which would be
offensive or objectionable to a reasonable man of ordinary
sensibilities.''
   Kelly acknowledges his chances of winning are slim, but argues
his client is entitled to privacy because she is not a prominent
figure and has not run for public office.
   He wants the newspaper to ``discern the newsworthiness'' of the
divorces it publishes. A hearing on the case is set for Monday,
when the court is expected to consider the newspaper's motion to
dismiss the lawsuit.
   Jane Kirtley, head of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of
the Press, said the lawsuit is frivolous. In open court, she said,
``the press' role is to act as a surrogate for that portion of the
public which cannot be there.''
   Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz, who defended
Newport socialite Claus von Bulow on charges he attempted to murder
his wife, said there is ``no possibility'' a state can bar
publication of a public record.
   ``The only way for the state to get around that is to say
divorce is not a matter of public record _ but of course it is,''
Dershowitz said.
   David B. Offer, the newspaper's editor, said divorces are
noteworthy, regardless of the people involved, because of their
effects on the community, its businesses, schools, churches and
welfare programs.
   ``Some may call that voyeurism or scandal,'' Offer said. ``But
it seems to me that if (divorces) are of interest to a segment of
the community that people have a right to read about them in a
community newspaper.''
   Kelly also contends divorce carries a social stigma, an argument
dismissed by sociologist Frances Goldscheider of Brown University.
``If 50 percent of marriages end in divorce, it can't be much of a
stigma anywhere,'' she said.
   Eileen Slocum of Newport's ritzy Bellevue Avenue, said divorce
is no more an issue in Newport than elsewhere. ``There are a few
very well-known people that really want no accessibility but there
aren't very many,'' she said.
   Slocum said she scans the divorce listing, like she does the
obituaries, because ``I hate to miss out on the death of a friend
or a divorce.''
   The plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, declined to be
interviewed, saying through Kelly that she did not want to discuss
her personal life. The attorney said she is in her 20s, was married
less than 10 years and had no children.
   A second woman who came forward after learning of the lawsuit is
identified in a pending amended complaint as Alison Roe. The
30-year-old works in the hotel business, has no children and was
married five years before her divorce.
   Roe agreed to be interviewed on condition her identity not be
revealed. She said she was harassed last December when her divorce
appeared in the paper, which also lists addresses and maiden names.
   A man telephoned late that night and said, ``Hello (Alison). I
hear you got a divorce,'' and made lewd remarks about her
relationship with her former husband before she hung up, Roe said.
   ``I wish I had a choice'' about keeping her name from appearing
in the 16,000-circulation newspaper, said Roe. ``It's no one's
business but my own.''

<TEXT>
   An indicted mayor and six challengers
on Tuesday face an electorate wearied by gambling's unkept promise
to bring some luster to this tourist-driven town.
   The problems facing the winner are daunting and long festering:
racial polarization among the 35,400 year-round residents, crime
and trash-ridden empty lots, all dominated by a multibillion-dollar
casino industry that attracts 32 million visitors a year.
   Those saying they can solve the problems are Mayor James L.
Usry, Councilmen Jim Whelan and Seth Grossman, former City Council
President Hank Tyner, state Assemblywoman Dolores Cooper, and
community activists John McQueen Jr. and Joseph Polillo.
   Usry and Whelan are expected to lead the field, but the others
could siphon off enough votes to force the issue into a runoff.
Under the city's non-partisan election system, a candidate must
garner more than 50 percent of the votes cast to win outright;
otherwise, the two top candidates will face each other in a June 12
runoff for the full-time job that pays $72,000.
   Bruce Ransom, executive director of the South Jersey Center for
Public Affairs at Stockton State College, cautions that predictions
in this election are difficult. But he adds: ``Voting patterns in
the city are generally done along racial lines.''
   The population is roughly 55 percent black.
   Ransom said Usry, the president of the National Conference of
Black Mayors who came to office in a special 1984 election and was
re-elected two years later, should hang on to enough of the black
vote from support generated in the churches. Some campaign
literature for him has focused on fighting the white ``system.''
   Usry, 68, is the city's first black mayor. He came to politics
from the city's school system, where he had served as an assistant
superintendent since 1977.
   Whelan, who is white, should win much of the white vote and
perhaps some black crossover, with Tyner, the second black
candidate, appearing to gain strength in recent weeks and perhaps
getting white crossover votes, Ransom said.
   Usry is the fourth of Atlantic City's past six mayors to be
indicted. He was arrested last July and indicted 5{ months later on
charges he illegally accepted $6,500 in bribes and illegal campaign
contributions.
   He is charged in two indictments with conspiracy, official
misconduct, bribery, gifts to public servants and violating the
state campaign contribution law. If convicted on all charges, Usry
faces up to 36 years in prison and $315,000 in fines.
   He has pleaded innocent and charged that racism touched off the
indictments against himself and 14 others in an alleged
money-for-favors conspiracy.
   Aside from veiled references to questions of ``integrity'' and
``leadership,'' Usry's opponents have avoided raising the
indictments as an issue.
   Whelan, 41, a swimming coach in a largely black school, has
accumulated the most endorsements. He has the off-the-record vocal
support of many casino officials and the on-the-record backing of
the local merchants association and The Press of Atlantic City, the
city's daily newspaper.
   He has put together the most audible campaign, running by far
the most radio advertisements. He also was at the center of the
campaign's largest mudslinging affair, facing allegations two weeks
ago of improperly touching an 11-year-old boy in his class in
October.
   The Atlantic County prosecutor's office said it found no
evidence to back up the charge, and Whelan claimed the rumor
started in the Tyner camp and was fueled by Usry campaign treasurer
Michael Hawkins, who represents the boy's family. Both camps denied
the charges.

<HEAD>Government Accepts Dialogue with Anti-Communist Demonstrators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINA PIRVULESCU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interim President Ion Iliescu agreed
to open talks with anti-government protesters who took their
demonstration for his resignation into its 14th day Saturday.
   As late as Thursday, Vice Premier Gelu Voican-Voiculescu
dismissed the thousands of demonstrators as hooligans and ruled out
dialogue. But that position changed late Friday during a meeting of
Iliescu, Vice President Ion Caramitru and other high-ranking
officials.
   The government said it will open talks with the protesters on
Tuesday morning but gave no further details.
   The demonstration has gained momentum each evening since it
began April 22 and has attracted crowds of up to 10,000. It also
has spread to at least two other major cities, Brasov and Timisoara.
   The number of hunger strikers vowing to fast until Iliescu
resigns climbed from 21 early this week to 57, increasing the
pressure for talks.
   The protesters charge that Iliescu and fellow members of the
National Salvation Front that dominates the government still harbor
Communist or totalitarian inclinations.
   Iliescu, who took over as president after the December
revolution that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu,
nonetheless is considered the favorite in presidential elections
May 20.
   On Friday night, several hundred demonstrators in Bucharest
slept in 40 tents pitched in and around the downtown University
Square that has been the site of their 2-week-old rally.
   On Saturday, crowds returned to the square, again blocking the
city's central traffic artery.
   Many protesters appeared skeptical that Iliescu would accept
their demand to exclude former high-ranking Communists such as
himself from national politics.
   ``As a Red, (Iliescu) will never agree to this,'' said Alexandru
Amariei, a 23-year-old student. ``The dialogue will not be a
dialogue, but a monologue ... an attempt to talk us into leaving
the square.''
   ``It is hard to anticipate the results of the dialogue ... but
whatever the results, we will not give up,'' said a member of an
independent league of students at Bucharest Polytechnic who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   At a news conference last week, leaders of various groups who
say they are coordinating the protest invited government leaders to
talk in their headquarters near University Square.
   They also expressed fears the government would order police to
clear the square if the rally went on as planned until the
elections.
   At a news conference Saturday, Vice Premier Mihai Draganescu
said the demonstrators will not be ``repressed by riot police,
except in extreme cases.''
   Draganescu, who is in charge of organizing the May 20 elections,
announced that the result of the presidential vote will be
published on May 22 and the results of parliamentary elections one
day later.
   He also said Premier Petre Roman has invited former President
Jimmy Carter and former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt to be
among the foreign observers.
   There was no word on whether the invitations had been accepted.
   In another development, a Bucharest court postponed until after
the elections a hearing on the appeal of four former high-ranking
Communist officials who were convicted in February of complicity to
genocide while serving under Ceausescu. They are appealing their
life prison sentences.
   They are former Interior minister Tudor Postelnicu, 59, former
Communist party Central Committee secretary Emil Bobu, 62, former
vice president Manea Manescu, 74, and former Politburo member Ion
Dina, 62.

   Fears of unemployment, inflation and fading
political support are forcing Soviet leaders to back away from
radical Polish-style economic reforms in favor of changes in easier
stages.
   ``Shock therapy is out of the question,'' Alexander Yakovlev
told Western and Soviet reporters Friday. ``It would be politically
short-sighted and practically impossible.''
   ``We have to create some sort of cushion or pillow,'' said
Yakovlev, a top aide to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ``It should
go in steps.''
   In a separate newspaper interview, he said radical reforms could
force 10 million people out of work ``if we went ahead mindlessly.''
   The newly created presidential council, Gorbachev's main
advisory group, is reviewing a proposed reform package to make sure
it does not send inflation through the roof.
   Yakovlev said, however, that prices must rise enough to sop up
an estimated 500 billion rubles ($825 billion at the official
exchange rate) Soviet citizens have stashed because there are few
consumer goods to buy.
   It was unclear how many changes the leadership would make in the
17-point reform program, part of which was leaked in March. Among
the provisions were laws and executive orders to sell some
government enterprises, allow stock transactions and turn the ruble
into a convertible currency.
   Gorbachev called in March for a ``normal, full-fledged market,''
and has said a new reform package would be announced at a session
of the Supreme Soviet parliament that begins May 14.
   During a recent trip to Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains,
Gorbachev encountered citizen arguments that the economy had
worsened and further reforms would plunge it into an abyss.
   Speakers and demonstrators at the May Day parade Tuesday in
Moscow also expressed serious concern over the effects of proposed
reforms.
   Despite all this, the Communist Party's radical wing appears to
be gaining strength on a platform of speedier reform. Yakovlev told
the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets: ``Generally, in the course of
this year, we must prepare conditions for a market economy.''
   In December, Kremlin leaders balked at radical economic reforms
proposed by Deputy Premier Leonid Abalkin.
   Since then, they have witnessed success in neighboring Poland.
The Solidarity government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki
raised prices in stages over six months, then went to a free market
at the New Year.
   Despite initial shocks, production of consumer goods appears to
have increased, the currency has stabilized and Solidarity has
stayed in power.
   In Moscow, Stanislav Shatalin of the presidential council said:
``The U.S.S.R. is not Poland. We are not one nation, united under
one church and the colossal authority of the pope in Rome.''
   The Soviet Union consists of 15 republics whose economic
conditions range from relative well-being in Europe to widespread
poverty and unemployment in Central Asia.
   Unlike Poland, ``our government does not have a credit of trust,
and so forth,'' said Shatalin, an economist on the council created
in March.
   A prominent radical, Vasily Selyunin, contended further delay
would harm the country.
   ``We are postponing formation of a government of national trust,
and tomorrow might be too late,'' he wrote in the May 2 edition of
the Literary Gazette. His article appeared next to one by Shatalin.
   Much of the public distrust, manifested in the angry slogans at
the May Day parade, stems from economic deterioration under halfway
measures that have left the country between central planning and a
Western-style market.
   Soviet and Western economists seem to compete with each other to
produce gloomy statistics.
   Industrial production fell 1.2 percent in the first quarter of
1990 from the last quarter of 1989, according to Soviet
statisticians.
   John L. Helgerson, CIA deputy director for intelligence, told
Congress on April 20: ``Soviet economic performance was abysmal in
1989, the worst since Gorbachev took over'' in 1985. ``Even a
modest economic recovery seems to us remote at best.''
   Helgerson estimated Soviet economic growth at 1.5 percent for
1989.
   In the economic debate last autumn, radicals argued that making
reforms was like crossing the Grand Canyon: if not done in one
leap, it could be fatal.
   As they approach the line again, a senior Western diplomat said
he was told by a ranking Soviet official: ``If we jump and don't
make it, no one is going to make a precise measurement of how far
we jumped.''

   Texans near the roaring Trinity River were warned
by the National Weather Service today to take precautions against
``an extraordinary, record-breaking flood.''
   The death toll from storms this week in Texas rose to seven.
Twelve Texans have died in flooding in during the last two weeks.
   Flooding or high winds also closed roads, downed power lines and
chased people from their homes in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Virginia and
Ohio.
   The river at Trinidad, about 60 miles southeast of Dallas, had
risen to 47.3 feet this morning, said Delois Langford, Trinidad
police dispatcher. Flood stage at Trinidad is 28 feet. The weather
service said it would crest at 47.5 feet.
   Ms. Langford said the flooding was damaging mostly farmland, and
that the towns of Trinidad and nearby Malakoff were not expected to
be flooded.
   However, emergency officials evacuated more than a dozen
families in two rural counties south of Dallas during the night as
levees along the river washed out. Upstream, many were still out of
their homes in southern Dallas.
   ``This is an extraordinary, record-breaking flood and is very
dangerous. It exceeds all floods of recent history,'' the weather
service warned.
   Forty miles north of Trinidad, a levee broke Friday along the
western bank of the river.
   ``Several other levees have either failed or may be ready to
fail,'' the weather service said.
   In southeast Virginia, a storm with tornado-force winds killed
two people and injured 10 others in August County. It blew apart
buildings, uprooted trees and tangled power lines in Augusta
Springs, Craigsville, Swoope and Churchville.
   The two killed were in mobile homes in Swoope when high winds
hit, said Bob Riley, a neighbor along Virginia 707.
   Strong winds knocked the Peoples Baptist Church of Augusta
Springs from its foundation.
   ``The power company is getting all the lines out of the way, the
highway department is cleaning up the roads and the fire department
is keeping an eye on peoples' property,'' Augusta Springs
firefighter Frank Sours said early today.
   High winds ripped across southwest Ohio, knocking down telephone
poles, uprooting trees and killing a woman whose trailor was thrown
150 feet. Four other people were injured at the mobile home park in
Middletown, said Fire Chief Charles Siefert.
   Authorities reported damage in Butler, Warren and Champaign
counties in Ohio and Franklin County in Indiana.
   In Oklahoma, residents near rain-swollen Lake Frances were
evacuated Friday when a concrete dam apparently shifted. The lake
crested at 25 feet, about 10 feet above flood stage and some of
those evacuated were allowed to return home.
   Oklahoma flooding this week claimed one victim, in Oklahoma
City. Police Capt. Charlie Owen said a 9-year-old boy apparently
was swept away by a rain-swollen creek and drowned Wednesday.
   Officials stepped up evacuations along the Arkansas River on
Friday as the state's worst flooding in recent years continued to
threaten communities near the river banks.
   Families were evacuated in portions of Perry and Faulkner
counties as the river began a slow rise to expected record-setting
crests, authorities said.
   Texas agricultural officials said yields from the wheat crop in
North Texas, which was less than a month away from harvest, may be
cut by as much as 20 percent because of rains of up to 10 inches
during the past week.
   North Texas has had 22.06 inches of rainfall in the first four
months of 1990, the most since 1922. As much as 7 inches of rain
fell within 24 hours in some areas.

<HEAD>Tehran Radio: U.S. Blocking Efforts For Release Of Hostages</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Reed, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States is blocking the release
of six American hostages in Lebanon by trying to distance itself
from any deals with Iran over the fate of the captives, Tehran
radio said Saturday.
   The radio said Tehran had successfully negotiated with captors
many times, an apparent reference to the freeing of two American
hostages last month by pro-Iranian Lebanese groups in the past two
weeks.
   ``In the end, it is the policies of the Western governments,
especially America, which have blocked such efforts, and not
allowed all the hostages to return to the arms of their families,''
said the radio, monitored in Nicosia.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said Thursday that American
educators Robert Polhill, 55, and Frank Reed, 57, were released by
their Lebanese captors at Iran's bidding. Polhill had spent 39
months in captivity, Reed, 43 months.
   Most of the 16 Western captives are believed held by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem groups.
   The longest-held of the hostages in Lebanon is Terry Anderson,
42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He
was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Both Iran and Syria _ which also helped negotiate the hostage
releases _ are thought seeking closer ties with the West to help
rebuild flagging economies, Iran's shattered by war.
   Rafsanjani branded the Bush administration a ``stubborn,
frustrated child'' for refusing to make a goodwill gesture to Iran
following the two releases.
   President Bush has said he won't negotiate the captives'
release. But on Thursday he said he was trying to encourage the
release of American hostages by helping Iran determine the fate of
four Iranians who disappeared in Lebanon in 1982.
   ``If that is goodwill, so be it,'' Bush said.
   Israel is holding 300 to 400 Lebanese Shiite prisoners,
including Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a pro-Iranian cleric abducted by
Israeli commandos in Lebanon in July 1989. Iran holds Christian
Phalangist militiamen responsible for the disappearance of the four
Iranians last seen in Beirut in 1982.
   The radio made no mention of Bush's offer.
   Saturday's Tehran radio commentary said Washington was torn
between not wanting to be seen negotiating with Iran and needing to
restore relations with Teharan.
   ``The Bush administration ... is engaged in anti-Iranian
policies to distance itself from so-called negotiations or deal,''
the state radio said. ``It is clear that America needs to resume
relations with Iran, which is a strong and strategic country in the
Middle East.''
   ``American actions, its contradictory statements and hollow
media statements either show Washington's confusion in adopting a
correct stance to solve this crisis, or it must be said the Bush
admnistration favors the hostage crisis to continue,'' the radio
said.
   It said Washington was trying to blame others for not releasing
the hostages ``to ease public pressure, which wants the government
to provide the grounds for release of the other hostages,'' the
radio said.
   In a related development, a Tehran newspaper on Saturday
criticized the British government for its handling of relations
with Iran.
   The newspaper Jomhuri Islami, which usually backs the
anti-Western elements within the Iranian government, said British
political leaders made no effort to explore the roots of the bad
relations between London and Tehran.
   Meanwhile, in Beirut, the spiritual mentor of Moslem militants
holding Western hostages said no more captives should be freed
unless Israel releases Arab prisoners, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
   ``We want the states of the world to pressure Israel into
releasing Arab prisoners the same way they exert pressure for the
release of Western hostages,'' al-Anwar quoted Sheik Mohammed
Hussein Fadlallah as telling a Friday prayer sermon.

   President Bush and congressional leaders are
set to meet Sunday for another budget summit and are again issuing
warnings that such meetings are easy to stage while results are
hard to produce.
   ``We don't want to raise a lot of hopes that there are going to
be any magic answers here,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House Budget Committee who will not be on hand for
the session.
   Government spending and taxing has been the product of
high-level negotiations between White House officials and the
leaders of Congress for the last three years.
   But the budget deifict has drifted upward all the same and many
in Congress have soured on such sessions.
   Sunday's meeting is already being portrayed as no more than a
preliminary discussion of whether there is a will to hold more
detailed budget talks later.
   ``It's a chance to discuss what the process will be, where we go
from here. The president's budget has been up there for some
time,'' on Capitol Hill, White House spokesman Steve Hart said
Saturday. ``We've expressed a willingness to have negotiations.''
   Hart said the meeting in the White House residence quarters
would be private between the president and the congressional
leaders, with possibly a few aides also on hand.
   Talking with Bush will be House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash.; House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.; Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine; and Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   The lowering of expectations is being done with good reason.
Using top-level negotiations to shape the government's $1.2
trillion budget has proven a tricky path to follow.
   Results of the last two negotiated budgets have been spotty at
best.
   A November 1987 deal between Congress and President Reagan
called for $30 billion in deficit reduction in fiscal 1988 and $46
billion more in fiscal 1989. Reagan hailed the pact as ``a good,
solid beginning'' to controlling the deficit.
   The results were less dramatic. In the end, the 1988 deficit was
$155 billion, $5 billion higher than the previous year. The 1989
shortfall dropped a bit to $152 billion.
   In April 1989, high-level talks involving the new Bush
administration yielded a deal for fiscal 1990, which runs until
Oct. 1. The agreement was supposed to shrink the budget gap to $99
billion. But the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office expects
this year's shortfall to reach $159 billion.
   ``When my Wall Street clients read about a $50 billion deficit
reduction package, they divide it by 10,'' said Stanley Collender,
who monitors the budget for Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm.
   What has gone wrong? Some of the savings the negotiators agreed
to were premised on the economy running on a higher gear than it
actually did. The poorer economic performance meant lower tax
collections for the government.
   Other savings never materialized because negotiators agreed to
spending cuts and higher revenues that Congress simply rejected.
   That points to a hurdle faced by high-level budget negotiators
who agree to a deficit-reduction package. Their next job is to get
key committee chairpersons _ and a majority of members of the House
and Senate _ to go along. And that is not easy when so many of
Congress' natural power centers are left out of bargaining sessions.
   ``To bind anybody, you've got to have a broader group'' than
those attending Sunday's meeting, said Rep. Silvio Conte of
Massachusetts, ranking Republican on the House Appropriations
Committee.
   Some legislators believe their political parties need to define
their budget priorities clearly and that negotiated deals blur the
distinction between Democrats and Republicans. Others flatly oppose
all negotiated budget deals, complaining that it leaves out
lawmakers and entire committees that should be involved.
   Translation: a budget pact worked out by the president and the
leaders of Congress still needs a majority of votes in the House
and Senate. And some members' votes do not come easily.
   Asked last week about the potential product of possible budget
talks, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten,
D-Miss., said, ``I'm all for it, provided it's something I agree
with.''

<HEAD>Major Disabled Rights Bill Heading for House Floor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill guaranteeing the rights of disabled
Americans is heading for the House floor, bolstered by a renewed
strong display of White House support.
   ``I look forward to signing a bill that will address the needs
of our disabled citizens,'' President Bush said Wednesday as the
House Judiciary Committee approved the measure 32-2.
   It was the fourth House panel to approve the Americans with
Disabilities Act and the lopsided vote was similar to those in
other committees.
   Bush's statement, however, comes after an unsuccessful effort by
his administration to amend the section of the bill dealing with
sanctions against employers who discriminate. White House
spokeswoman Alixe Glen said the administration is weighing whether
to press the issue on the House floor.
   The battle over whether discrimination victims can sue for
punitive or compensatory damages will still be fought in the debate
over a major civil rights bill being considered by the Education
and Labor Committee.
   ``I think the president is supportive of the bill and will sign
the bill as it is now written,'' said Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md.,
the chief House sponsor of the disabilities act. There are 241
cosponsors, 37 of them Republicans, according to a list supplied by
Hoyer.
   The bill extends civil rights protection to disabled people in
employment, public and private transportation, public
accommodations, state and local government, and telecommunications.
   Supporters say it represents a compromise with the White House
and balances the needs of businesses with those of the disabled.
Employment provisions are phased in over four years and businesses
with fewer than 15 employees are exempt. Retrofitting and major
renovations are not required.
   Business interests say they are satisfied with a number of the
House amendments but would like further clarification of some
provisions.
   They also want tax relief to absorb the uncertain cost of
accommodating disabled customers and employees as well as
assurances that regulations are in place before enforcement is
required.
   Hoyer said at a briefing on the bill last week that he believes
it will be taken up the week of May 15 or May 22.
   The Senate passed the bill last September by a 76-8 vote.
   Attempts to amend the bill can be expected on the House floor.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says it will fight for an amendment
to have the employment provisions of the disabilities bill
decoupled from the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which covers
minorities and women.
   The pending Civil Rights Act of 1990 would strengthen the 1964
law. One provision would allow jury trials in which punitive and
compensatory damages may be sought against employers who allegedly
discriminate.
   ``That's your plaintiff lawyer's wish list,'' said Frederick
Krebs, a Chamber official.

<HEAD>Labor Holds Final Council in Local Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition Labor Party retained control of a
London council that set the highest tax rate in the country under
an unpopular new law, according to final results Saturday from
Britain's local elections.
   Labor won a resounding victory over Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservatives in the nationwide balloting Thursday.
   The Conservatives won 11 percent less of the popular vote than
they captured in the 1987 general election.
   However, that was not as bad as the 20 percentage point loss
predicted in opinion polls, and some analysts said Mrs. Thatcher
was now more secure against possible challenges to her leadership.
   Nevertheless, Sir Anthony Meyer, the Conservative lawmaker who
unsuccessfully challenged her in September, said the results of the
elections indicated it was time for a change at the top of the Tory
party.
   Millions of voters protesting soaring home mortgage loan rates
and an unpopular new levy, the so-called poll tax, deserted the
Conservatives.
   The tax, which replaced a property levy paid only by homeowners,
is widely perceived as unfair because every adult in the same
district pays the same rate, irrespective of income.
   Despite setting Britain's highest poll tax, nearly $940 per
person, Labor-controlled Haringey council in north London was
re-elected Saturday with three additional seats.
   With results declared from all 201 councils contested, Labor
gained 303 seats, the Conservatives lost 193 and the centrist
Social and Liberal Democratic Party lost 49.
   Labor now controls 111 of the councils contested, up from 97,
the Conservatives had 51, down from 60. The centrists had 17, down
two. No party won a majority in the rest.
   A computer analysis by the British Broadcasting Corp. showed
Labor with 42 percent of the vote, enough for a comfortable general
election victory, and the Conservatives 31 percent. The next
general election must be held by June 1992.

   Few things are unkempt in this Chicago
suburb of million-dollar homes, but the slayings of a young couple
have left a messy case marked by international intrigue and a
bloody last goodbye.
   A $20,000 reward and a multistate police investigation have done
little to solve the killings of Richard and Nancy Langert, whose
bodies were discovered April 8 by her father in the basement of a
townhouse he owned.
   ``Is it baffling? Yeah it's baffling, if you mean interesting,''
said police Lt. Joseph Sumner, who can see the roof of the
townhouse from his office window. ``But it's not unsolvable.''
   Police quickly ruled out robbery. Instead they are examining the
couple's business, family and personal lives, as well as a fourth
area that they refuse to discuss _ the involvement of Mrs.
Langert's sister, Jeanne Bishop, in supporting human rights in
Northern Ireland and defending an Irish Republican Army member
imprisoned in New York.
   Police are examining the couple's finances and the possibility
of a drug or other criminal link. The family contends there is
none. Friends and co-workers at Gloria Jean's Coffee Bean Corp.,
where the two worked, say likewise.
   ``If you were looking for best friends to have, they were the
kids that you would want to be best friends with,'' said Roger
Badesch, spokesman for the Arlington Heights-based chain of gourmet
coffee stores. ``There's just no way that they could be involved in
anything that would warrant this.''
   Langert, 30, and Mrs. Langert, 25, had been staying at the
townhouse for about six months while they prepared to move into
their own home in another suburb. On April 7, they went to dinner
with Nancy's parents and Ms. Bishop.
   Police say that one or more intruders were waiting when the
couple returned home. They were led into the basement. Richard was
handcuffed and shot once in the back of the head.
   Mrs. Langert, 2{ months pregnant, was shot through the elbow.
Police said it was as she tried to escape. She then was shot twice
in the torso and bled to death at the foot of the stairs.
   A neighbor reported hearing Mrs. Langert say ``No, not again!''
followed by popping shots, but said she thought it was the
television. Mrs. Langert's father, M. Lee Bishop, discovered the
couple the next day.
   Mrs. Langert's purse was found on the first floor of the
townhouse. Neither the $500 she had readied for bank deposit nor
her credit cards were taken, but her purse and wallet had been
searched, police said.
   Investigators also found the handcuffs, a small, bloody ax, an
article of clothing believed to belong to an offender and four
slugs from a .38- or .357-caliber Magnum pistol.
   On a piece of fallen shelving they found a message written by
Mrs. Langert in her own blood.
   Police say only that the message appears to have no
significance. The Chicago Tribune reported that it was a heart,
followed by a ``u'' _ an apparent goodbye message from the dying
woman to her loved ones.
   Police refuse to say whose blood is on the ax or further
identify the article of clothing. But they have made three trips
out of Illinois to investigate three different angles in the
killings, including a trip to the East Coast to examine Ms.
Bishop's activism on behalf of prisoners in Northern Ireland, which
is racked by Protestant-vs.-Catholic violence.
   A local television station first reported, quoting law
enforcement sources, that Ms. Bishop was the target of an alleged
death threat connected to her work in Northern Ireland.
   Ms. Bishop said the alleged threats were disclosed by law
enforcement authorities to get her to divulge her contacts in
Northern Ireland. The FBI and police deny leaking the story, but
Ms. Bishop has since stopped cooperating.
   There have been four slayings in the history of this suburb of
13,000, about a half-hour north of Chicago on Lake Michigan, where
the average home sold for $300,000 to $400,000 in 1988.
   The most notorious was in '88 when a young woman, Laurie Dann,
went on a shooting spree at a grade school, killing an 8-year-old
boy and wounding several others before killing herself.
   The Langert killings and the rumors about Ms. Bishop's Irish
connection no longer dominate conversations. Police Chief Herbert
Timm said he feels no pressure from residents because the ``very
complex mystery'' is still unsolved.
   ``I think (residents) feel that it's an isolated incident,''
said Tom King, who lives in nearby Morton Grove and works a block
from the townhouse. ``I think if it had been a burglary (and
killing) there'd have been a lot more worry about it.''

   Freed hostage Frank Reed said
today his kidnappers ``treated me fine'' the last six months of his
captivity and that he was in good health.
   ``I'm beautiful, I'm OK,'' Reed said, appearing in high spirits.
He said he will be through his testing next Tuesday and probably
would return to his home in Malden, Mass., that same day or
Wednesday ``to the real celebration of success.''
   ``So far everything is fine,'' he said in an interview with The
Associated Press. ``I'm just getting life-giving muscles. Every
muscle in my body is completely out of shape. When you stand up,
you're going against the force of gravity. I haven't even done that
very much.'' Reed was blindfolded and bound much of his time in
captivity.
   Later today, Brig. Gen. Robert W. Poel, commander of the Malcom
Grow Air Force Medical Center, said Reed appeared to be in good
shape although his muscles are weak and his weight dropped to about
140 pounds. He weighed 185 pounds before captivity.
   ``He's also tired, he's fatigued,'' said Poel, adding that Reed
will probably have to wait until the end of the coming week before
he can go home.
   ``I've eaten quality food but haven't had much of it,'' Reed
said. ``They treated me fine the last six months. Room service was
good. We used to joke, John (McCarthy), Brian (Keenan) and I, that
room service was pretty good when we got extra coffee, popcorn or
something.''
   Reed was held hostage with McCarthy and Keenan at varying times.
   Reed is undergoing medical evaluation after returning to America
and to the arms of his two grown daughters for the first time in
eight years.
   ``Fellow Americans, because of all of you I'm alive,'' he said
in thanking friends, family and fellow hostages.
   On Reed's first night back, the family dined on lobster, the
first thing he said he wanted when he got back home from captivity
in Lebanon. Today he breakfasted on pancakes.
   Reed tried to catch up on things with his daughters whom he
hadn't seen since 1982 and he was laughing again, just the way they
remembered him.
   Reed's daughters, his wife and the crowd that greeted him here
Friday wept as he thanked them and eloquently pleaded for the
release of ``my mates left behind,'' the remaining six Americans
and nine other Westerners held by Islamic militants in Lebanon.
``God, make it soon,'' he prayed.
   But Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said his
country will not work to free more hostages until Israel releases
hundreds of imprisoned Lebanese.
   Velayati, ending a two-day official visit to Finland, demanded
the United States intercede with the Israelis and make other
goodwill gestures to reciprocate for the release last month of Reed
and Robert Polhill.
   In a statement issued in Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
blamed the U.S. government for hindering the release of the other
hostages. ``The ball is now in America's court,'' it said.
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed to be an umbrella group for
the factions holding the hostages.
   In an outpouring of emotions, Reed warmly embraced Polhill, a
fellow educator who was released just eight days before Reed was
freed last Monday. ``We're going to get the rest of them out,
aren't we?'' Reed whispered in his ear.
   The 57-year-old Reed stepped off the small Air Force jetliner
from Wiesbaden, West Germany, unsteady after losing 60 pounds and
being blindfolded and chained during his more than 3{ years in
captivity.
   The two daughters from a previous marriage, Marilyn Langston,
33, and Jacqueline Reed, 28, of Malden, Mass., went aboard the
plane for a brief private reunion before the family stepped out to
face the public.
   Reed's Syrian-born wife, Fahima, known as Fifi, and their
9-year-old son, Tarek, flew with him from Germany.
   In a roll-call salute to his fellow hostages and their families,
Reed said:
   ``Because Tom, Terry, John and Brian refused to let me give up,
I am with you today. Because of Peggy Say, Kit and Joan Sutherland,
the Keenan sisters, Pat McCarthy, and many, many others, I am
unchained and unblindfolded.''
   Reed had disclosed earlier that at varying times he had been
held with Terry Anderson, The Associated Press' chief Middle East
correspondent and longest held hostage with more than five years in
captivity, as well as Thomas Sutherland, an American University of
Beirut dean, and Britons Brian Keenan and John McCarthy.
   Reed's aged mother, Leota Sprague, remained at the family's home
in Malden, but he paid tribute to her and said he was eager to
visit her after his medical tests are completed.
   ``To every member of my family and that very special
91-year-old, beautiful mother of mine, who by example demonstrated
to the world that we Reeds aren't quitters, I love and thank you
for your prayers,'' he said.
   ``It's really a miracle. God has answered our prayers,'' Mrs.
Sprague said from her home. ``We're not really a crying family.
That's not how we fight (for change). We always expected him to
come home, we never lost faith.''
   Reed had been told repeatedly by his captors that his mother had
died.
   Ms. Say, Anderson's sister, and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts were among the non-family members greeting Reed,
director of the private Lebanon International School in Beirut.
Reed was kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986.
   En route to the Malcolm Grow Medical Center at this base near
Washington, Reed was greeted by Barbara Bush as she was about to
board a flight to Kentucky.
   ``We're so glad you're home,'' the first lady told him. ``I know
the president wishes he was here to meet you.'' President Bush was
in Oklahoma giving a commencement address but is likely to meet
with Reed soon.

<HEAD>U.S. Military Cancels Leaves After Marine Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. military canceled off-post
leaves Saturday for American servicemen in the Philippines after a
Marine was shot and killed outside the Subic Bay naval base,
apparently by Communist rebels.
   Gunnery Sgt. John S. Fredette, 34, of Buena Park, Calif., was
wounded late Friday when five gunmen approached him in the
nightclub district of Olongapo, 50 miles west of Manila, and shot
him in the neck, police said.
   Fredette, who died an hour later, was on temporary assignment to
Subic with Marine Fighter@Attack Squadron 323, based at the Marine
Air Station in El Toro, Calif.
   No group claimed responsibility for the killing, but police
investigator Romeo de Guzman said it had ``all the earmarks'' of an
assassination by Communist rebels.
   A Philippine intelligence officer said on condition of anonymity
two assailants were believed to be New People's Army guerrillas
from Orani in nearby Bataan province and had received ``orders to
liquidate Americans.''
   Philippine officials warned this month that the New People's
Army was planning to kill an American before talks begin May 14 on
extending the lease on six U.S. bases in the Philippines.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri said the travel ban applied
to the 40,000 troops, Defense Department civilians and military
dependents at the six installations.
   ``All nonessential off-base travel has been restricted at all
the U.S. facilities in the republic of the Philippines,'' Mukri
said in a statement broadcast by the Far East Network, the military
television station.
   In Manila, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt expressed his ``shock
and sorrow at the cowardly murder.''
   The rebels have not traditionally operated in the Olongapo area,
but they are strong near Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila.
   If the rebels were responsible, Fredette would be the sixth
American slain by guerrillas since Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe
was assassinated in suburban Quezon City in April 1989.
   Two Americans working for the U.S. Air Force were killed last
September on the day Vice President Dan Quayle arrived in Manila
for an official visit.
   And two American civilians were killed earlier this year in
separate attacks on the islands of Bohol and Masbate. In October
1987, Communist rebels gunned down three Americans in simultaneous
attacks outside Clark.
   Concern about a possible rebel attack mounted after police
arrested an alleged rebel assassin in Olongapo earlier this month.
Documents seized from the man, Dionisio Bendoy, indicated
insurgents planned to kill Americans in the city before the talks.
   The United States maintains the Subic base, Clark Air Base and
four other smaller facilities under a 1947 pact that expires in
September 1991. There is growing opposition in the Philippines to
the bases.
   In another development, the military said rebels killed at least
14 people, including a town mayor, in attacks in the central and
southern Philippines since Thursday.
   Six Philippine army troopers and four government militiamen were
killed Thursday in San Vicente, a town in Davao del Norte province
about 50 miles north of here and 580 miles southeast of Manila.
   On Friday, three Communist assassins gunned down the police
chief of Tagum town, about 30 miles north of San Vicente, police
said.
   On central Panay island, suspected insurgents on Friday killed
Mayor Roger Aguirre and two bodyguards during a dance in Malay
town, about 200 miles southeast of Manila, the military also
reported.
   The Communist New People's Army has waged a 21-year insurgency
to establish a Marxist state.

   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene
said Saturday that the Soviet Union ultimately will be forced to
recognize an independent Lithuania.
   ``Moscow will see that there is no other way because of the
West,'' Mrs. Prunskiene told about 150 eager members of the
Lithuanian American Youth Association.
   The prime minister cautioned the predominantly young crowd
against assuming that once a declaration of independence is made _
like Lithuania's proclamation on March 11 _ the battle is over.
   Rather, the effort has just begun in trying to convince the West
and Moscow of Lithuania's strong desire for democracy.
   ``We yearn for a freedom and the West realizes it,'' Mrs.
Prunskiene, speaking in Lithuanian, told the group. ``We alone have
to convince other nations what our aspirations are.''
   The prime minister, who has lobbied President Bush,
administration officials and members of Congress during a two-day
crusade for Lithuanian independence, received a rousing welcome
from the crowd at a Capitol Hill hotel.
   Hoots and hollers punctuated the applause as the prime minister
arrived and chants of ``Lithuania, Lithuania,'' filled the room as
Mrs. Prunskiene departed, a bouquet of flowers in her arms.
   Although Mrs. Prunskiene was introduced to the crowd in
Lithuanian, the phrase ``darling of Washington'' was used, in
English, to describe her and the reaction the prime minister has
received since her arrival.
   But in her speech, the prime minister balked at the title.
   ``It is not very good that I am considered a darling. We must
realize it is the process, not the people,'' she said.
   The prime minister's session with Bush failed to produce the
assurances she sought, but Mrs. Prunskiene said she remains hopeful
that she can convince Western nations that embracing independence
for Lithuania will not undermine the reform effort by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Mrs. Prunskiene was scheduled to meet with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher in London on Tuesday and was expected to
use the occasion to appeal once more for Western guarantees of
Lithuanian sovereignty.
   The prime minister said among her major concerns in Lithuania's
push toward democracy is the spring military conscription.
   Although she signed legislation ending the draft in Lithuania,
Mrs. Prunskiene said it was difficult to ``trust the common sense
of the Soviet Union.''

   Pope John Paul II on Sunday begins an
eight-day trip to Mexico aimed at boosting the morale of his Latin
American flock and strengthening the church in the officially
anti-clerical country.
   The pontiff's 47th foreign trip will take him to 10 Mexican
cities. He plans to greet prosperous businessmen in Durango,
slum-dwellers outside Mexico City and migrant workers in Chihuahua
and Monterrey near the U.S. border.
   The pope is also scheduled to stop on the Caribbean island of
Curacao before returning to Rome on May 14.
   John Paul will emphasize a theme of his trip on Sunday with the
beatification of Juan Diego, a Mexican Indian honored as the person
to whom the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared in 1531.
   The pope has made the Virgin a symbol of his ``new
evangelization'' campaign to strengthen the church in Latin
America, the home of nearly half of the world's 850 million
Catholics.
   That program will be capped by a 1992 celebration of the 500th
anniversary of the discovery of the Americas.
   ``Ninety percent of Mexicans are Catholic, 98 percent are
Guadalupanos,'' said a Vatican official, referring to the wide
devotion to the virgin.
   Using the 1992 anniversary as his banner, the pope is trying to
inject vigor into a Latin church that is fast losing ground to
evangelical sects. In Mexico, the number of Protestants grew more
than 500 percent between 1950 and 1980, to 3.29 percent of the
population, according to Mexican church figures.
   John Paul pressed the Vatican to speed up the beatification
process for Juan Diego so the Indian could be honored in connection
with the anniversary, the Vatican official said on condition of
anonymity.
   Beatification is a step toward sainthood and means Masses can be
celebrated in the person's honor.
   The beatification ceremony will also emphasize the church's
increasing efforts to appeal to the poor, including Indian groups.
In the past, the church has been accused of joining the ruling
class in repressing Mexico's native population.
   ``By elevating one of them, Juan Diego ... the church
demonstrates her option for the poor and makes us understand in an
unequivocal way that all races and ethnic groups have the same
human dignity,'' the Rev. Paolo Molinari, an official involved in
the beatification process told Vatican Radio.
   John Paul will address the issue of indigenous groups in Tuxtla
Gutierrez, which has a large Indian population. Thousands of
Guatemalan refugees are also expected for the ceremony in the city,
located near the Guatemalan border.
   During his visit, the pope will likely speak about delicate
topics he has raised in his previous nine trips to Latin America,
including the foreign debt, workers' rights and birth control.
   But his speeches could be particularly controversial in Mexico,
which has some of the strictest anti-clerical laws outside the
Communist world.
   According to the Mexican Constitution, written in 1917 after
years of revolutionary upheaval, the church does not legally exist
and cannot own property. Priests are forbidden to speak about
politics from the pulpit or to wear clerical garb outside churches.
   These regulations have been routinely ignored or dodged in
recent years. And since the pope's last trip in 1979, relations
between the Vatican and Mexico have warmed considerably.
   In a sign of the improvement, Mexican President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari named a personal envoy to the Vatican last February. The
step is expected to lead to a resumption of diplomatic relations,
broken in the mid-19th century.
   The pope has said repeatedly his visit is pastoral, not
political.
   However, Vatican officials say, the pontiff's visit will
strengthen the hand of local church leaders, now pressing the
government for more rights.
   The pope's prestige may also help the local church spread
Catholic teaching that opposes artificial birth control. The
Mexican government has promoted the use of contraceptives to limit
population growth to 1 percent by the turn of the century.

   An earthquake rocked southern Italy on
Saturday, and authorities said two elderly people died of heart
attacks, at least 19 people were injured and thousands of panicked
residents ran from their homes.
   The temblor _ centered in the poor, mountainous region of
Basilicata _ knocked loose plaster and cornices from buildings when
it struck at 9:21 a.m. It measured 4.8 on the Richter scale,
according to the National Institute of Geophysics in Rome, 185
miles northwest of Basilicata.
   The epicenter was 95 miles southeast of Naples. The quake was
felt as far south as the regions of Calabria and Puglia, the toe
and heel of the Italian boot, as well as in Abruzzo, a mountainous
region in central Italy.
   Parts of Basilicata are still unrepaired from a quake in
November 1980 that killed 3,000 people and leveled thousands of
buildings there and in the adjacent Campania region around Naples.
   The prefect's office in Potenza, regional capital of Basilicata,
reported that a 68-year-old man died of a heart attack and that 16
people were injured, including a young woman whose skull was
fractured by a falling cornice.
   Later reports said a 69-year-old woman in Salerno province in
Campania suffered a fatal heart attack and three people in the
region were injured.
   The Potenza prefect's office said many of the injuries occurred
as thousands of terrified residents fled their homes.
   Many of the people reportedly camped outside their homes as the
area was rocked by numerous aftershocks, at least three of them
fairly strong.
   Train travel in Calabria and Campania was slowed so inspectors
could check the tracks for possible damage.
   Fausto Bubbico, the mayor of one of the hardest-hit towns,
Brindisi di Montagna, said at least a dozen families were forced to
evacuate their homes because of damage. Other towns reported cracks
opening on main streets.
   The national telephone company, SIP, reported lines were tied up
by calls to fire departments and other authorities. It issued a
statement asking people to limit their calls to emergency cases.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.

<TEXT>
   A gambling dispute
among Mohawk Indians that flared into violence last week, claiming
two lives, is the latest episode in a long-simmering feud over how
to preserve their traditional way of life.
   Since at least the turn of the century, Mohawks have battled
Mohawks over how their nation should be governed.
   The latest violence was triggered by the six casinos and bingo
parlors that line the highway running through the American side of
the reservation, which also extends into Canada.
   In addition to the two killings, more than 500 people fled the
violence before state police moved in and sealed off the
30,000-acre reservation, called Akwesasne by the Mohawks. As of
Saturday morning, the standoff continued but things were quiet,
state police said.
   The gambling palaces, illegal under state law, were bringing
busloads of tourists, hundreds of jobs, and millions of dollars to
the economically depressed reservation. The money has financed
large, new houses for some that stand in sharp contrast to the
cottages and trailer homes of other Mohawks.
   ``Without the casinos, this reservation won't be nothing,'' said
Terry White, who works as a blackjack dealer in Tony's Vegas
International when the casinos are open.
   But that runs up against the Mohawks' traditional lifestyle.
   ``Under traditional philosophies, all forms of gambling are
considered illegal and cannot be sanctioned,'' said Jim Ransom, a
member of the elected tribal council.
   Traditional Mohawks consider the reservation a sovereign nation
governed by the 1,000-year-old Iroquois Great Law of Peace. Some
live without electricity, speaking only Mohawk and sending their
children to Mohawk schools.
   They have clashed in the past with other Mohawks who want to
administer the reservation as a municipality, subject to state and
federal laws, and oppose the state-recognized elected council of
the reservation.
   In 1979, Akwesasne traditionalists took over a St. Regis police
headquarters to protest its ties to county sheriff's departments,
then barricaded themselves in an encampment for nearly a year.
State police intervened when Mohawks supporting the reservation
council formed an armed blockade around the encampment.
   The tribal police were abolished in 1981, and there has been no
local law enforcement on the American side of St. Regis since then.
   In 1986, traditionalists protested against illegal taverns on
the reservation after nine Mohawks were killed in drunken driving
accidents in three weeks. One speakeasy burned to the ground and
the others closed.
   The confrontations have occasionally spread beyond the St. Regis
borders.
   In 1974, a group of traditionalist Mohawks occupied an abandoned
girls' camp in the Adirondacks in north-central New York, claiming
it as their ancestral land. After three years of negotiations with
the state, the Mohawks agreed to move to land near the Canadian
border, about 60 miles east of the St. Regis reservation. This past
March, a National Guard helicopter was struck by bullets fired from
that enclave, prompting an 11-day armed standoff between Mohawks
and police.
   In recent years, the traditionalists have divided into two
camps, with the traditional chiefs on one side and the Warrior
Society, a self-appointed reservation security force, on the other.
   The chiefs accuse the Warriors of provoking the recent violence
and protecting the casino owners, while the Warriors say the chiefs
are trying to take over the reservation undemocratically.
   Both sides agree that the heart of the dispute is not the
casinos, but who has the right to govern.
   The question is ``how our aboriginal treaty rights are to be
used,'' said Mike Mitchell, the anti-gambling chief of the elected
Canadian Mohawk council. ``They are not to be used to house casinos
and illegal activities.''
   Whether or not to allow gaming must be decided by all the people
of the reservation, said Minnie Garrow, a Warrior supporter.
   ``They say we're gun-toting, violent people, but we're going to
go by the will of the people,'' she said. ``People just want their
basic human rights to decide on the issue.''
   The violence has affected the Mohawks' neighbors in the nearby
town of Massena. In quieter times, people often drive through the
reservation, stopping to play bingo, eat at the Bear's Den
restaurant, or buy tax-free cigarettes.
   But in recent weeks, most townspeople have detoured around the
reservation. School buses have stopped entering Mohawk land to pick
up students, and town officials canceled a sports meet that was to
be held on the reservation.
   The greatest tragedy, said Mitchell, is the rift the dispute has
sown among the Mohawk people.
   ``Our whole culture is based on peace,'' he said. ``The violence
is caused by outside influences.''
   Many of the people he is fighting are his relatives and former
friends, Mitchell said.
   ``It will take many years to heal the wounds and shake hands
again.''

<HEAD>IMF Chief Sees Decision Tuesday on $60 to $80 Billion in
Contributions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision should be reached early this week
on whether to make an additional $60 billion to $80 billion
available for lending to eastern Europe and Third World countries,
the director of the International Monetary Fund said Saturday.
   At a news conference, IMF managing director Michel Camdessus
said he was hoping for a higher amount than the $60 billion figure
given last week by a Treasury Department official.
   ``It will vary in a relatively narrow band between the
significant and the rather substantial,'' said Camdessus,
predicting an agreement Tuesday on the amount.
   He accepted a reporter's suggestion that ``significant'' meant
an increase of 50 percent in the fund's resources and ``rather
substantial'' could be as high as 70 percent.
   The Treasury official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
$12 billion of the $60 billion would come from the United States,
making it the top contributor. Other lead contributors are Britain,
France, Japan and West Germany.
   The fund's present resources theoretically total about $120
billion worth of many kinds of money, but much of it is in Third
World currencies that are little wanted by borrowers.
   Representatives of the 152 governments in the fund and its
sister organization, the World Bank, began a series of semi-annual
meetings at their Washington headquarters on Friday. They will
continue until Tuesday.
   Camdessus praised Poland's new non-communist leadership for what
he called its head-on approach in shifting toward a market economy,
instead of moving more gradually.
   ``This has worked,'' he said.
   He pointed out that the zloty, Poland's currency, has been so
stable that there has been no need to use the international
stabilization fund set up to support it.
   The fund and bank are supporting Poland with loans, which now
amount to more than $1.1 billion.

   The Contra rebels agreed Saturday to
start laying down their arms this week after the newly elected
government promised to begin reducing the size of the
Sandinista-controlled armed forces.
   The agreement, a major victory for new President Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro, could signal an end to nearly a decade of civil war in
Nicaragua.
   Only two days ago, the U.S.-backed Contras had insisted the
Sandinista army must be dismantled at the same time as the rebels,
a demand the Chamorro government rejected as dangerous to
Nicaragua's fragile peace.
   The accord was the result of more than 15 hours of talks
involving rebel leaders, Mrs. Chamorro, Cabinet members, and
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo that ended early in the morning.
Unlike earlier agreements, the accord was signed by a top rebel
commander, Israel Galeano.
   The so-called Declaration of Managua calls for the 12,000-man
rebel army to begin laying down their arms Tuesday. They are to be
fully disarmed by June 10.
   Mrs. Chamorro promised to order a reduction in the size of the
armed forces, estimated to number 300,000, and the disarming of
thousands of civilians in zones where the Contras are to begin
demobilizing.
   The Sandinistas gave their supporters thousands of weapons
between the time they lost the Feb. 25 elections and when Mrs.
Chamorro took office in April.
   The president, who also serves as defense minister, did not say
how deep the cuts in the military would be.
   ``On June 10, we will announce the program of the reduction of
the armed forces ordered in (my) inaugural address of April 25th,
and whose implementation should begin immediately,'' Mrs. Chamorro
said.
   The accord also said the security of the rebels and their
families camped with them would be guaranteed and that they would
be given humanitarian assistance.
   ``I hope that the insurgent troops understand that there are
reforms under way to construct and fortify a true democracy,''
Galeano said.
   He said he was considering forming a peasant organization. ``One
must look at the climate and look for a way to contribute, to erase
the climate of social distrust created by the repression that
existed here,'' he said.
   Galeano did not say what prompted his decision to sign the
accord. He and other Contra leaders had been angered by Mrs.
Chamorro's decision to retain Gen. Humberto Ortega as head of the
army.
   Ortega, brother of former President Daniel Ortega, was defense
minister in the Sandinista government and a member of the party's
nine-man national directorate. He and other Sandinistas in the
military resigned their political posts after the election as part
of a transition agreement with Mrs. Chamorro.
   Most of the Contra army, estimated at between 9,000 and 12,000
fighters, has returned to Nicaragua from Honduran base camps in the
past few months. Many are in security zones supervised by U.N.
peacekeepers.
   The Contras first pledged to turn in their weapons by June 10 in
an accord they reached with Mrs. Chamorro's government on April 19.
   But that agreement soon began to unravel in a dispute over Gen.
Ortega's position and the size of the army the Sandinista leader
still controls.
   Saturday's agreement essentially salvaged the April 19 accord.

<TEXT>
   West Germany is tempting the Soviet
Union to drop objections to a unified Germany's membership in NATO
with its mightiest weapon: the powerful Deutsche mark.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze has rejected the
Western Allies' demand that a united Germamy belong to NATO.
   But West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said
Bonn was ready to offer broad economic cooperation with Moscow to
clear the military obstacle from the path to German unity.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl made a similar offer, although both men
shied away from specifics. Increased trade ties are considered the
strongest possibility.
   Kohl spokesman Hans Klein, speaking on the eve of the talks,
said Bonn was interested in an ``expansion of German-Soviet
relations, especially economic cooperation.''
   With the Soviet economy collapsing amid ethnic unrest,
inefficiency and the disintegration of the Soviet-led economic
alliance, COMECON, the prospect of economic aid could lessen the
military loss of East Germany to NATO.
   ``Money can help, but the question is also of a psycho-political
nature of how the Soviets can keep face,'' said Ingo Kolboom, an
expert on international affairs at the respected German Society For
Foreign Policy.
   Indeed, the Soviets appeared indignant at suggestions they would
be willing to sacrifice security interests for Western economic
assistance.
   ``We are not selling any political concern of our country. It's
not a sale,'' Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin said
as Shevardnadze met with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
on Friday.
   But the West German offer came as Soviet trade ties have been
badly buffeted by revolutions in Eastern European nations, which
now are more interested in developing trade links with the West.
   Unification will bring further changes as East Germany, the
Soviet Union's largest trading partner, and key supplier of
technology, industrial components and consumer goods, merges with
West Germany.
   While West Germany has already pledged to take over East
Germany's trade obligations with the Soviet Union, many agreements
between East Berlin and Moscow expire in 1990 and are not expected
to be renewed.
   But Bonn has a number of options to help rescue the Soviet
economy.
   West German banks hold part of the Soviet Union's estimated $50
billion foreign debt and could play an important role in
restructuring payments, which now eat up about 25 percent of Soviet
export earnings.
   West Germany has already stepped up food aid to the Soviet Union
and could increase such exports. Bonn also could lobby Western
allies to cut restrictions on high-technology exports to the Soviet
Union.
   In addition, Bonn could expand credit guarantees for West German
companies interested in setting up joint ventures with Soviet
partners. Financial guarantees could be important if the Soviet
Union tries to make the ruble partially convertibile.
   It is also likely Bonn will take over subsidies East Berlin pays
the 380,000 Soviet troops and 120,000 dependents stationed in East
Germany, equal to about 700 million East marks last year. West
German press reports have said the Soviets might demand that sum be
paid in convertible currency, meaning a tidy profit for Moscow.

   It soon became apparent why helicopters were

sundae.
   ``He said he liked our hot fudge sundae. That's what he ordered.
One with nuts on it, but the two employees who were waiting on him

   Indian troops shot and killed nine people
who tried to cross from the Pakistan side of the frontier to
Indian-governed Kashmir on Saturday, including five armed Moslem
militants, official sources said.
   The most serious clash occurred near the Jhelum River 45 miles
west of Srinagar, the center of the Kashmir secessionist movement,
the sources said.
   The Indian border force killed five armed Moslem militants and
captured three others in a clash about 3 a.m., according to the
sources. An Indian guard and a doctor serving with the border force
also were killed in the clash.
   In other encounters along the frontier on Saturday, Indian
forces shot and killed four men who tried to enter Indian-governed
Kashmir at different places, according to the sources, who cannot
be identified under brefing regulations.
   They said one of the four was a militant, but the other three
were unarmed and they did not know if they also were militants.
   It was the second day in a row that Indian officials reported a
clash along the disputed frontier. Indian troops killed seven
Kashmiri militants on Friday in another sector of the confrontation
line between India and Pakistan.
   The Islamic militants want predominantly Moslem Kashmir to
secede from mostly Hindu India.
   India accuses Pakistan,which is overwhelmingly Moslem, of
harboring and arming the separatists. Pakistan says it supports
Kashmiri Moslems' right to self-determination but denies sheltering
or arming them.
   The two countries went to war over Kashmir in 1948 and 1965.
Both sides say they do not want another war, but the current
Kashmir crisis has heightened their traditional distrust and
animosity.
   At least 337 people have died in Kashmir since Jan. 20 when
Indian launched its harshest crackdown to date on the increasingly
violent separatist movement. The majority were Moslem militants or
supporters shot by Indian troops while defying curfew or staging
anti-India demonstrations.
   Both India and Pakistan have claimed Kashmir since the two
nations were partitioned along religious lines when they won their
independence from Britain in 1947. The old princely state of
Kashmir had a Moslem majority, but its ruler was a Hindu and he
opted to join India.
   Kashmir became part of the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir, and
India later abolished princely rule.
   Sixty-four percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are
Moslems, but nationwide they make up only 12 percent of the
population. Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million
people.

<TEXT>
   Elder statesman Constantine Caramanlis was
sworn in Saturday for a five-year term in the largely ceremonial
post of president.
   Caramanlis, a six-time premier and former president, is Greece's
fifth head of state since democracy was restored after a 1967-74
military dictatorship.
   ``I swear ... to protect the rights and the freedoms of the
Greeks and to serve the general interests and progress of the Greek
people,'' Caramanlis said before a full sitting of Parliament. The
ceremony was conducted by Greek Orthodox Archbishop Serapheim of
Athens and All Greece.
   Caramanlis, 83, was first elected to Parliament in 1935.
   He was Greece's first premier after a 1967-74 military
dicatorship, overseeing the return to democracy and establishing
the presidency after holding a referendum that abolished the
monarchy.
   Caramanlis also engineered Greece's entry into the European
Community in 1981.
   He became the republic's third president in 1980, resigning in
1985 shortly after the then-socialist government reneged on a
promise to support his bid for re-election.
   Caramanlis won 153 votes of the 299 cast in Parliament on
Friday. He needed at least 151 votes for an absolute majority in
the 300-member chamber. He was supported chiefly by the ruling
conservative New Democracy party.

   The graves of dramatist Bertolt Brecht and
his wife have been vandalized and smeared with anti-Semitic
slogans, the official East German news agency ADN reported Saturday.
   Brecht, a Jew and a Marxist, fled the Nazis and lived in the
Netherlands and the United States before settling in East Germany
in 1948, where he directed the state-supported Berliner Ensemble.
   ADN said vandals painted slogans such as ``Jews Out'' on the
grave of the dramatist and his wife, Helene Weigel, and on the
walls of the East Berlin cemetery. The report did not say when the
vandalism occurred.
   Brecht's plays include ``Threepenny Opera,'' with music by Kurt
Weill, and ``Mother Courage and Her Children.'' The playwright died
in 1956.
   Reports of anti-Semitism and violence by neo-Nazi groups have
increased since East Germany's pro-democratic revolution in October.

   Leiterman was unarmed, but he carried the recorder in his pants
pocket to record the meeting. Instead, it recorded an argument
between the two men and the sound of Leiterman being stabbed in the
back with a kitchen knife, officials said.
   Lavoyed Hudgins, deputy chief of police, said revealing the
exact contents of the tape might jeopardize the investigation. A
police officer for 12 years, he said he'd ``never encountered
another situation like this.''
   ``I think it will be very, very critical to the investigation,''
Baldwin County Coroner Huey Mack said. ``You've got both of those
people on a recording. I'd rather have that than physical
evidence.''
   Huntley called police after the stabbing and was being held in
the Baldwin County Jail on a murder charge, police said Saturday.
   Leiterman owned B.L. Trading Co. in Pensacola, which operated
boats and bought and sold shark fins. Huntley had sold shark fins
to him in the past, authorities said.

   Hundreds of young people battled police
with rocks and bottles overnight in a party-turned-riot that led to
scores of arrests and several injuries in this university town,
authorities reported.
   At least five police officers were hurt clashing with an
``extremely hostile and agressive'' mob that at one point numbered
about 1,000, a fire department report said.
   At least one gasoline bomb was tossed and police were pelted
with bottles, rocks and beer cans. At least one policeman needed
hospital treatment.
   Some 50 arrests were reported on a variety of charges that were
still being sorted out Saturday at the jail. Most of the charges
were failing to disperse and throwing projectiles.
   The party was believed connected to ``Rancho Chico'' days,
celebrating pioneer times in this northern California valley town
about 120 miles north of San Francisco.
   The melee started as a party of about 500 got rolling in earnest
at about 10 p.m. Friday at an apartment complex called ``The Zoo,''
authorities said.
   Police responded, but held back until reinforcements could
arrive, including a helicopter with a spotlight.
   Police, invoking the Mutual Aid backup provision under state
law, bolstered their ranks to about 60 with officers from Chico
State University, the Buttle County sheriff's department, Orland
police, the California Highway Patrol, state Alcohol Beverage
Control agents, and Chico firefighters.

<HEAD>ANC Leader Says Full Talks on Power Sharing To Begin Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An African National Congress
leader received a standing ovation Saturday when he told a mostly
white university that full-scale negotiations on ending white rule
probably would begin soon.
   The ANC's Thabo Mbeki said three days of talks between his
organization and the government had dramatically improved the
climate for negotiatons on a new constitution to include the
country's 28-million black majority.
   ``It would be reasonable to make the assumption that we are not
very far from a process of (constitutional) negotiation which would
involve all parties,'' Mbeki told a predominantly white audience of
1,000 at Stellenbosch University outside Cape Town.
   The ANC and the government wrapped up three days of discussions
Friday and agreed for the first time to work together toward
removing obstacles to constitutional negotiations.
   ``The ANC is very committed to creating a political system in
this country which is color blind,'' said Mbeki, head of the ANC's
foreign affairs department. ``We have a history defined too much by
color, too much by race.''
   Mbeki, who has spent 27 years in exile, received a standing
ovation and sustained applause for his remarks.
   Stellenbosch is considered the country's most prestigious
university for Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended settlers of South
Africa who comprise 3 million of the country's 5 million whites.
Many of the country's leaders attended the university.
   Also Saturday, a newspaper reported that former President P.W.
Botha, dissatisfied with the changing policies of the government,
has withdrawn from the ruling National Party that he served for
more than 50 years.
   The Afrikaans-language newspaper Rapport said Botha, who
resigned last August after 11 years in power, was upset with the
wide-ranging reforms introduced by his successor, F.W. de Klerk.
Botha declined to renew his party membership when it expired
recently, Rapport said.
   Talks between the ANC and the government have won wide support,
but a militant black group predicted there could be pitfalls ahead.
   ``I don't see how the ANC and the government can share power,''
said Zeph Mothopeng, president of the Pan Africanist Congress.
   ``Negotiations can only take place after an election'' that
includes the black majority, Mothopeng told a Johannesburg news
conference.
   The Pan Africanists say the only matters they will negotiate are
the direct transfer of power from whites to blacks and the transfer
of white-owned land to blacks. The Pan Africanists split with the
ANC in 1959 over tactical issues and the two anti-apartheid groups
remain rivals to this day.
   Another ANC rival, the relatively conservative Inkatha movement,
accused Mbeki of promoting black divisions in the strife-torn
southeastern province of Natal.
   In remarks Thursday, Mbeki suggested that Mangosuthu Buthelezi,
leader of Inkatha and head of the Zulu homeland, should sit with
the white-led government rather than with black anti-apartheid
groups in any constitutional negotiations.
   ``This kind of rhetoric from the Thabo Mbeki's of this world
fans the flames of the very violence they claim to be concerned
about,'' Buthelezi said. ``It is not Mr. Mbeki who will decide
where I will sit.''
   About 4,000 blacks have died in Natal since 1986 in fighting
between ANC supporters and Inkatha.
   ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela and de Klerk, appearing at a
joint news conference Friday, said the preliminary discussions were
an important step toward normalizing political activity and sharing
power.
   Both sides said they would establish a ``working group'' to
resolve obstacles to full constitutional negotiations. De Klerk
said no agreement had been reached on further talks, but the
working group would report by May 21 and both sides hoped for swift
progress.
   The joint statement stressed the need to end political violence
that claimed hundreds of lives in recent months. Also, the
government pledged ``to work toward lifting the state of
emergency'' _ a key ANC demand.
   Asked about the government demand the ANC renounce its armed
struggle, Mandela said, ``The ANC will therefore look into the
question of the armed struggle and take appropriate decisions.''
   In London, Archbishop Desmond Tutu on Saturday described the
talks as ``epoch making.'' Shortly before flying to the United
States, Tutu pointed to a front page newspaper picture of Mandela
and de Klerk, sitting side by side and smiling.
   ``It is incredible. When one looks at that picture, one realizes
that it really is epoch making,'' Tutu said at London's Heathrow
Airport.

   The more the House delays making a decision on
Rep. Barney Frank, the more potential problems it creates for
everyone involved.
   For Frank, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, the longer the
investigation into his relationship with male prostitute Stephen
Gobie drags on the more it becomes entwined in his re-election bid
this fall.
   For the ethics committee, the continuing disagreement threatens
to erode the panel's carefully nurtured reputation for
non-partisanship.
   For House Democrats, an inevitable vote on the Frank case will
put them on record as either abandoning a party colleague or
appearing to condone what Frank himself admits was ``bad judgment.''
   Even Republicans who might expect to gain from Frank's troubles
might be wary lest House members of both parties start to find
their personal lives going under the investigative microscope.
   Frank has already announced his bid for a sixth term despite a
deadlock in the ethics committee's eight-month investigation.
   The slow progress prompted him to abandon his plan to await a
verdict before announcing whether he would seek reelection.
   There is no time limit on the ethics committee and every week of
delay brings it closer to the election.
   At least one conservative Republican is hoping the case is
resolved in time to get Democrats on the record before elections.
   Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif., has promised to seek a
floor vote on expelling Frank from the House once the ethics
committee completes its work.
   He wants to force Democrats to choose between anti-homosexual
sentiments among the voters and loyalty to a colleague who has
ensnared himself in an unpopular ethics case.
   ``A Democratic incumbent who votes against a tougher penalty
will have to answer whether that sort of behavior would be
tolerated locally,'' said Gary Koops of the National Republican
Campaign Committee. Koops said Republican strategists have no plans
to make the Frank case a national political litmus test. Rather, he
said, ``it's a district by district issue.''
   Republicans will fail if they try to pin Barney Frank's problems
on other Democrats, according to Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee spokesman Howard Schloss.
   Republicans tried to use former House Speaker Jim Wright's
troubles at elections in some 30 congressional districts and failed
to do any political damage, Schloss said.
   ``It just doesn't work,'' Schloss said. ``That's not why people
vote for members.''
   When the closed-door ethics committee deliberations broke down
last week _ eight months into the investigation _ initial
speculation held that Republican members were insisting on a tough
penalty in hopes of forcing a floor vote.
   Committee members who insisted on anonymity said however that
much of the dispute within the panel concerned upholding its
reputation as a bi-partisan body whose recommendations
traditionally have been unanimous.
   The ethics panel is different from other House committees, which
are controlled by majority Democrats, because its membership is
evenly divided between the two parties.
   The committee members also said there is no unanimity among
precedent-conscious lawmakers on how to address the question of an
individual congressman's sexual conduct.
   Any committee decision is likely to address the question of
whether it is tolerable for a member of Congress to hire a
prostitute.
   The case focuses on Frank's admission that he paid Gobie $80 to
have sexual relations with him in 1985 and that he hired Gobie as a
personal assistant and chauffeur.
   It also centers on the charges by Gobie that he operated a
prostitution ring out of Frank's Capitol Hill apartment with the
congressman's knowledge, that the two had sexual relatons in the
House gymnasium and that Frank invoked congressional privilege to
waive parking tickets incurred by Gobie while using Frank's car.
   Particulars of the Frank case seem unusual enough that they
might not produce a precedent applicable in many future
controversies. But some ruling by the House on the question of
prostitution seems all but guaranteed.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee chairman charged on Saturday
that the manufacturer of the Navy's new $1.2 billion guided-missile
destroyer is hampering congressional investigators examining
allegations of contract fraud.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said the Bath Iron Works of Bath,
Maine, has refused to provide the congressional General Accounting
Office with documents or allow investigators to interview employees
unless the GAO promises to withhold the information from Congress.
   Dingell, in a letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, said it
was time the Navy got tough with the contractor.
   ``The Navy appears to be coddling Bath rather than protecting
the public's interest,'' Dingell wrote.
   A copy of the four-page letter, dated May 2, was obtained by The
Associated Press.
   A spokesman for Bath Iron Works said Saturday the company has
cooperated with the GAO and the Defense Contract Audit Agency,
which are looking into the allegations by Dingell and those made
anonymously through a whistleblowers' hotline.
   ``Mr. Dingell's letter contains no new allegations that we've
heard about,'' said Jim McGregor, the company's spokesman.
   Dingell, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on oversight and investigations, has been highly
critical of the Navy's plans to buy 33 of the DDG-51 destroyers at
a cost of about $30 billion.
   Dingell has questioned the survivability of the ship and its
sophisticated Aegis weapons system against missile attack and
alleged that the Navy's contract with Bath is a ``procurement
nightmare'' of fraud and abuse.
   The destroyer, called the Arleigh Burke class after the World
War II naval hero and former chief of naval operations, is designed
with an all-steel superstructure and will be equipped with Tomahawk
cruise missiles.
   The Pentagon, as part of its budget-cutting efforts and
rethinking of the Soviet threat to the West, may scale back the
program.
   In his letter to Cheney, Dingell said Bath had violated the
Pentagon regulation that all contractor employees fill out their
time cards in ink to avoid supervisors directing them to mischarge.
   ``None of the yard workers at Bath Iron Works fill out their own
time cards _ they are filled out by their supervisors who also have
responsibility for the budgets,'' Dingell said.
   ``This is an outrage _ it violates every principle of
responsible internal controls and makes it virtually impossible to
audit for mischarging,'' he said.
   The Defense Contract Audit Agency, in an effort to prevent
mischarging, conducts surprise floor checks in which investigators
question employees on what they are working on and compare that to
the job they are charging their time.
   According to Dingell, however, the Navy and Bath Iron Works
reached an agreement that required the DCAA to give the company
24-hour notice before a floor check.
   Dingell said that despite the limitation, investigators found an
employee who submitted two time cards, both of which were accepted
by the company; a part-time employee who recorded 40 hours of work
although he only worked 25 hours; and an employee who charged his
time to a cost-reimbursable contract when he admitted to
investigators he worked on a fixed-price contract.
   ``The preliminary DCAA audits have indicated that there is
substance to virtually all of the anonymous allegations of
mischarging and defective pricing,'' Dingell said.
   Bath spokesman McGregor disputed the congressman's claims.
   ``Bath Iron Works never intentionally mischarged anything on any
of its contracts with the Navy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gordon Calls for Investigation of New Telephone Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Game,'' a million-dollar telephone
trivia quiz promoted as ``a direct line to the American dream'' may
violate interstate gambling laws, a Tennessee congressman says.
   Participants in ``The Game,'' scheduled to start Monday, either
lose the $2.99 cost of calling the 900-prefix telephone number or
win prizes ranging from $5 to $1 million, says Rep. Bart Gordon.
   ``Participants in this game are effectively betting $2.99 that
they will win money, much as participants in a lottery pay for the
chance to win cash,'' Gordon said Friday, calling for a federal
investigation into the contest.
   ``Only one of every 100 participants wins even the $5 prize,''
he said.
   In ``The Game,'' produced by the Los Angeles-based 900 Million
Productions, contestants call in and compete with as many as nine
other callers to be the first to answer a trivia question.
   The winner gets a toll-free number to call to compete with other
first-round winners for a $5 prize. Second round winners proceed to
a third round with $100 prizes.
   The winner of seven rounds is supposed to win $1 million, which
gives contestants odds of one in 10 million, said Kent Syler, a
spokesman for the Democrat.
   Gordon sent a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on
Friday asking for an investigation into whether the game requires
skill or dumb luck, said Kent Syler, administrative assistant for
Gordon.
   Syler said the only skill required by the game would be the
dexterity of contestants' fingers in pressing the numbers on the
telephone.
   ``It is, at best, borderline gambling,'' Syler said. ``I can't
think of another opportunity a person has to pay a fee and win some
money.''
   Not so, said Rhonda Brauer of Hill and Knowlton Inc. in Los
Angeles, who is handling public relations for ``The Game.''
   ``It's definitely a game of skill and knowledge _ and speed,''
she said. ``It is not a game of chance.''
   She did say the questions are based on common knowledge. ``You
have to be knowledgeable about things in the United States like how
many keys are there on a piano,'' she said. There are 88 keys.
   ``The Game'' was developed by Allen Koss, who produced such
television game shows as ``Tic Tac Dough,'' ``Concentration'' and
``The Joker's Wild.''
   While contestants can play ``The Game'' at any time, May 20 is
the first date the company will give away the million-dollar prize,
officials say, and other millionaires will be made every second
Sunday thereafter.
   ``Only in America is it possible to win $1 million from the
privacy of home,'' said Lynn Folse, vice president of 900 Million
Productions. ``For the first time, people can use their touch-tone
phones for a direct line to the American dream.''

   Dissatisfied with the changing
policies of the government, former president P.W. Botha has
withdrawn from the National Party that he served for more than 50
years, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The Afrikaans-language newspaper Rapport said Botha, who
resigned last August after 11 years in power, was upset with the
wide-ranging reforms introduced by his successor, F.W. de Klerk.
Botha declined to renew his membership in the governing party when
it expired recently, Rapport said.
   The newspaper said Botha was angry that the African National
Congress delegation that met with the government Wednesday through
Friday included Joe Slovo, who also is the head of the South
African Communist Party.
   While in office, Botha said that he would never consider the
possibility of a black government in South Africa. He also said he
would never negotiate with the ANC while it continued to pursue its
guerrilla campaign.
   Since his departure in August, De Klerk has freed leading black
nationalist Nelson Mandela, legalized the ANC, pledged to dismantle
apartheid and negotiate a new constitution that includes the
country's 28-million black majority.
   Last week's talks were the first ever between the government and
the ANC since the congress was formed in 1912. Both sides agreed to
try to end the country's ``climate of violence'' and work toward
negotiations on a new constitution.
   Botha, 73, was a staunch anti-communist throughout his political
career, which began in the 1930s when he dropped out of college to
begin working for the Nationalists.
   He won a seat in Parliament in the 1948 election that brought
the National Party to power. The Nationalists began codifying
apartheid legislation shortly afterward and have governed South
Africa continuously for the past 42 years.
   He became prime minister in 1978 and then president in 1984
under a new constitution.
   Botha, known for his thundering temper, was credited with
instituting limited race reforms in the early 1980s.
   But after nationwide unrest erupted in 1984, he relied
increasingly on the security forces to crack down on anti-apartheid
activists.
   Botha suffered a stroke in January 1989. He returned to office
several weeks later, but clashed repeatedly with his Cabinet. He
resigned in August following a dispute.
   Since then, Botha has remained out of public view and has not
had any contact with his former colleagues, according to government
sources.

   The four World War II allies agreed
Saturday that German unification should go forward without delay,
and they shied away from imposing restraints on what will be
Europe's most powerful nation.
   ``The Cold War is over. Our planet, the world, Europe, are now
embarking on a new road,'' Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze said after the nearly seven-hour meeting.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher read a
declaration by the nations that set a timetable for further talks,
with a session in June in Berlin, in July in Paris and in September
in Moscow.
   It was the first top-level unification session among the
Germanys and the Allies _ the United States, Soviet Union, Britain
and France _ which split Germany into two countries 45 years ago.
   The diplomats also agreed to invite Polish Foreign Minister
Krzysztof Skubiszewski to the Paris session, when border issues
will be discussed, Genscher said.
   Poland has expressed fears over possible German claims to
territory that belonged to Germany before World War II, and Poland
will have the right to address all related issues, the declaration
said.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, appearing at a joint
news conference with the other diplomats after the meeting,
emphasized that Germans of the new nation should make their own
decisions.
   Otherwise, he said, the Allies would be ``planting seeds of
future instability.''
   Asked about such touchy issues as the size of a new German army
and how close it might be deployed to Poland and the Soviet Union,
he said: ``Ultimately, the fundamental decision with respect to any
nation's military forces is going to be up to that nation.''
   Genscher reiterated a pledge that the new nation would renounce
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. But he also rebuffed
continued Soviet objections to NATO membership for a united
Germany, the main sticking point in the talks.
   Shevardnadze repeated in statement Friday that a solution was
possible.
   ``I'm optimistically inclined,'' he said. ``I think we shall
succeed on all of these matters in finding mutually acceptable
solutions. That is the premise upon which we proceed.''
   ``Are there any serious divergences? I don't think we should
dramatize. This is normal around negotiations,'' he said. ``The
Soviet delegation, the Soviet leadership, intend to work
constructively in order to accelerate the vitally important
historical process of building German unity.''
   A senior U.S. official said during a briefing later, however,
that during the meeting Shevardnadze reiterated Soviet opposition
to NATO membership.
   The foreign minister said it would be ``difficult for the Soviet
people to accept and create an imbalance in Europe,'' said the U.S.
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told reporters the
Western allies did not want Moscow to feel its security interests
were being neglected.
   However, he added that ``at the end of the day, it's not of
course for them (the Soviets) to decide'' whether a united Germany
is a member of NATO.
   The meeting was held behind closed doors in the West German
Foreign Ministry.
   Baker set the tone in a speech that said the work of the four
powers should be limited to relinquishing their 45 years of control
over Berlin, the old German capital.
   ``We face the challenge of rising above the past,'' he said in
comments distributed to reporters before the meeting. ``We engage
in an act of reconciliation _ of a people too long separated, of a
continent too long divided.''
   According to a British official who briefed reporters on the
condition of anonymity, Shevardnadze ``accepted entirely the
self-determination of the German people.''
   Neither Shevardnadze nor Baker dwelled on Germany's Nazi past.
   ``We don't want a discussion on obsolete views,'' the British
official quoted Shevardnadze as saying.
   Genscher emphasized in his opening remarks that there were
``difficult problems'' to solve. ``If we are all willing not only
to defend our own interests but also to respect the interests of
our partners, then we will find solutions.''
   He cited the Helsinki Final Act regulating relations among
European countries in his rebuff of Moscow's stance against a
unified Germany joining NATO.
   ``The Final Act emphasizes quite distinctly that all principles
are of primary significance,'' Genscher said. ``In this connection,
I refer to the principle of sovereign equality, which gives all
participating states the right to be or not to be a party to
treaties of alliance.''
   ``Since we know that the Western alliance, adapting itself as it
does to the changes in Europe, brings about peace and security, a
free-standing united Germany would be of no benefit to Europe,'' he
added.
   The Soviets have called for a neutral Germany, while
Shevardnadze was quoted last month as favoring a ``non-aligned''
Germany.
   Baker acknowledged that other nations have ``legitimate
interests'' that may need to be addressed, a reference to the
Soviet Union, which lost more than 20 million people to the Nazi
invaders.
   Baker said the new Germany should not extend beyond the borders
of what are now East Germany, West Germany and Berlin.
   Genscher has said a united Germany will be in NATO, but he also
has offered to let the Soviets keep some of their troops in what is
now East Germany for a transitional period.
   About 250,000 U.S. troops are stationed in West Germany, with an
estimated 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany.

   Governments and bankers are finding a new goal
for lending billions of dollars internationally every year: the
promotion of democracy.
   This is a sharp departure the traditional political neutrality
of banks, although that tradition is gradually being honored more
in the breach than in the observance.
   The World Bank, whose largest stockholder is the United States,
has not made loans in recent years to Nicaragua or Vietnam. After
the bloody Chinese suppression last year of student demonstrators,
the United States arranged for $720 million in World Bank loans to
be suspended.
   Of the 152 governments that own the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund, 30 of them will be owners of the new European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development.
   The United States will be the largest single stockholder in the
new $12 billion bank when arrangements are completed. That is
expected to happen May 30 in Paris.
   ``The purpose of the bank shall be to... promote private and
entrepreneurial initiative in the Central and Eastern European
countries committed to and applying the principles of multiparty
democracy, pluralism and market economics,'' says the first of its
Articles of Agreement.
   That is a long journey from the ancient Roman proverb, ``Money
has no smell.'' And the World Bank's own Articles of Agreement say:
   ``The Bank and its officers shall not interfere in the political
affairs of any member; nor shall they be influenced in their
decisions by the political character of the member or members
concerned.''
   Members of the World Bank do include both communist and
non-communist governments. The World Bank estimates total lending
to Third World countries at $1.3 trillion. Some of the leaders of
those countries are communists, others are authoritarians with
other ideologies.
   And there appear to be limits to how far the bank will go in
rewarding ideology.
   World Bank President Barber Conable, an American, took issue
with a statement last week by Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of
State for Africa. Cohen predicted that in the not-too-distant
future the United States will make progress toward democracy a
condition for aid.
   ``I don't know what Mr. Cohen may have meant when he said that
political conditionality was a desirable force,'' Conable said.
   ``We, obviously, respect democracy and support it but so far as
our development work is concerned, it's based on economic
criteria.''

<HEAD>Reputed Cali Cartel Leader Interrupts Trial to Plead Guilty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The reputed No. 3 man in Colombia's Cali drug
cartel and an associate pleaded guilty to federal drug charges two
weeks into their trial, after a defense attorney concluded the
government had ``an unbeatable case.''
   Luis Santacruz Echeverri, accused of handling the U.S. end of
shipments, pleaded guilty to 49 counts; Guillermo Penagos,
reputedly his top lieutenant, admitted to 30 charges, court
officials said Friday.
   Jose Quinon, Santacruz's attorney, said he advised his client to
make the plea after details of the government's case came out. ``It
was an unbeatable case, very well put together,'' Quinon said.
   In exchange for the pleas, the government agreed to drop the
most serious count, operating a continuing criminal enterprise,
which carryies a mandatory life prison sentence.
   As it is, the charges they pleaded to Thursday carry a minimum
term of 10 years and a maximum of life imprisonment. Their trial
had been expected to last another month.
   ``Echeverri's as big an active doper as we've ever gotten,''
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Vick Jr. ``This disrupts their
U.S. operation.''
   John Fernandes, spokesman for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said, ``Echeverri's a mover and shaker, and he is
very trusted in South America. You don't easily replace him.''
   The case against Santacruz blossomed with the seizure of 2{ tons
of cocaine at a Chicago produce market. The Colombian cocaine had
arrived in Miami aboard a Honduran freighter and had been trucked
to the Chicago warehouse.
   Hotel and airline records placed Santacruz and Penagos in
Chicago when the cocaine arrived, signaling that leaders of
Colombia's lesser known cartel were overseeing shipments personally.
   Santacruz, who has had homes in Miami since 1983, was known to
the DEA as the U.S. coordinator of the cartel's smuggling
operations. Federal agents say his half-brother Jose Santacruz
Londono is co-leader of the cartel based in Cali, Colombia.
   Luis Santacruz was arraigned behind bars last July at the
federal Metropolitan Correctional Center southwest of Miami because
of fears that fellow traffickers would try to either kidnap or
assassinate him.
   The trial was before U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who
also is handling the drug trial of deposed Panamanian ruler Manuel
Antonio Noriega.

   A team of divers and a naturalist rescued a
rare giant whale shark that became entangled in fishing nets in the
Gulf of Aqaba on Saturday, Israel army radio reported.
   ``We had to get him out of the net, but you have to remember
that this was an 8-meter (26-foot) shark, so it wasn't exactly like
taking taking a fly out of a net,'' said Roni Zilber, a member of
the Nature Preserve Society who helped cut the shark free.
   ``Since this shark is an endangered species, we are very
interested that it continue to swim in the Gulf of Aqaba,'' he said
on army radio, adding that it was caught by mistake.
   The shark weighed about 1,500 pounds and that its appearance
near the town of Eilat was a rare phenomenon, he said. The
fisherman who caught the shark immediately notified nature
officials when he discovered it in his nets.
   The whale shark is a harmless plankton feeder and can grow to 50
feet. It is the largest in the shark species.

   Thousands of Czechs joined U.S.
veterans Saturday for a sun-kissed streetfest in the first
celebration ever of the liberation of this beer-brewing city by
American troops in World War II.
   Pubs were turned into imitations of Wild West saloons, and
youths with American Army paraphernalia rode the streets on vintage
Harley-Davidson motorcycles inherited from their parents.
   Up to 150,000 visitors were expected to descend on Pilsen, a
city of 130,000, on Sunday, when President Vaclav Havel and U.S.
Ambassador Shirley Temple Black were to preside over the close of
the two-day celebration.
   Gen. George C. Patton's 3rd Army liberated Pilsen on May 6,
1945, just three days before World War II ended in Prague.
   By agreement with the Soviets, American troops came to a halt at
the demarcation line cutting southwest through Czech territory,
leaving the Red Army to conquer the Czechoslovak capital.
   ``Boy, everybody wanted to go on to Prague and get it over
with,'' said Cpl. Ross Johnston, 75, an attorney from Zanesville,
Ohio. ``But we had to stop here, wait for two weeks and then we
were pulled out.''
   The Communists barred any commemoration of the U.S. liberation
of about 3,600 miles of Czechoslovak territory and marked May 5 as
a day of liberation by Soviet troops.
   Six months after Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution in
December, however, the atmosphere in this grim industrial city had
changed remarkably.
   American flags adorned the former bastions of Communist
officials, and scores of U.S. veterans were in town for the
celebration.
   Tens of thousands of people turned out Saturday morning to see
the ceremonial inauguration of a monument to the 2nd Infantry
Divison on Pilsen's downtown Republic Square.
   Those who lived long enough to see the return of Patton's men
still remember the postwar atmosphere.
   ``It felt so right that our town was freed from the Nazis by a
western army,'' Frantisek Kotva, a pensioner, mused over a mug of
the city's famous beer.
   ``We all loved the GIs, but then we had to forget about them for
a long time,'' he said, alluding to the four decades of Communist
suppression that followed.
   Elsewhere in Czechoslovakia, the occasion was marked with
quieter ceremonies.
   Ambassador Temple Black joined Jan Urban, the leader of the
Civic Forum movement that led the revolution against the
Communists, at the unveiling of a memorial to the U.S. Army in
Vitejovice, about 70 miles southwest of Prague.
   A similar plaque was unveiled in the nearby town of Chodov. In
Lipnik and Bevcou, crowds gathered to remember Martin Zeberski, a
U.S. pilot killed there in August 1944.
   Havel and Temple Black will lead Sunday's festivities in Pilsen,
which were to begin with a morning ceremony at the demarcation line
and end with a ``country ball.''
   ``I've been to several similar events, but this is much bigger
than any of us expected,'' Johnston said.
   ``If the very president of the United States came here in
person, he could not be shown more courtesy and respect than we
were.''

<TEXT>
   West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker went sightseeing Saturday, the last day of his
unprecedented visit designed to calm Polish fears about German
unification.
   During four days of official meetings and informal visits,
Weizsaecker repeatedly assured Poles that a united Germany would
respect Poland's borders and wants to contribute to an ``integrated
Europe,'' not dominate it.
   Adam Michnik, a leading Polish thinker, wrote in Saturday's
pro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza that the Weizsaecker visit, the
first to Poland by a West German head of state, will bring a new
perspective to bilateral ties.
   ``A lot depends on Polish-German relations, especially stability
in the heart of Europe,'' Michnik said. ``It is not enough to be
afraid of Germans.''
   ``From this time on, we must take up Polish-German problems at a
different, higher level,'' he said.
   Weizsaecker ended his visit sightseeing at the birthplace of the
18th century German philosopher and writer Gottfried Herder in
Morag, and at a museum for the astronomer Copernicus in Frombork.
   He planned to return Saturday to Bonn, where the foreign
ministers of both Germanys and the four victorious World War II
allies were holding talks on German unification.
   Poland has sought a role in the talks to press its security
concerns, especially the permanence of its postwar western border,
drawn along the Oder and Neisse rivers to include territory from
defeated Germany.
   The rush toward German unification has been received with
concern in Poland, where the prospect of a resurgent economic and
political power next door stirs memories of Germany's World War II
aggression.
   ``The distance between our nations is diminishing, but in order
to eliminate it completely, we should learn well the ... layers of
distrust between us,'' Weizsaecker told students at Gdansk
University Friday.
   Michnik wrote that Poland, as it struggles to transform its
Communist political and economic system, can learn from the West
German experience.
   ``It is not enough to feed one's conscience with the memory of
martyrs, and it is absolutely not enough to reduce the interest to
the Oder and Neisse border,'' he said.
   ``The Federal Republic of Germany belongs among the most
democratic states and we should know more about how the Federal
Republic was formed and the welfare of Germans was ensured,'' he
said.
   Michnik, a key opposition activist before Solidarity toppled
Poland's Communist regime last year, said there are parallels
between Germany and Poland.
   He said Weizsaecker, a German army officer who participated in
the Sept. 1, 1939 invasion of Poland at World War II's start, also
has roots in the German political and social groupings from which
resistance to Hitler developed.
   ``This is the German tradition of resistance against a
totalitarian system. The tradition of anti-totalitarian resistance
is also our root. It is easier to meet in this field,'' Michnik
wrote.
   Weizsaecker began his visit Wednesday, the first of two days of
meetings in Warsaw with President Wojciech Jaruzelski, Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and other leaders.
   On Friday, he traveled to Westerplatte, the Baltic penisula
where the first shots of World War II sounded when a German ship
opened fire on a small Polish garrision. He also met with
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and toured Gdansk, which was occupied
and then destroyed by Germany during the war.

<TEXT>
   A center-right party that wants
Croatia to declare its independence from Yugoslavia hopes to win
control of the republic's parliament in elections Sunday and Monday.
   The Croatian Democratic Union won 104 of the 131 seats in the
republic's 356-seat, three-house parliament in the first round of
voting April 22-23.
   The remaining 225 seats are to be decided in the balloting that
begins Sunday, and initial results are not expected until Monday
afternoon.
   There was no campaigning Saturday, which was mandated a ``day of
silence'' in the race for the republic's first free elections in 50
years.
   Political observers believe that another victory for the
Democratic Union and its leader, Franjo Tudjman, a retired army
general once imprisoned for almost five years for nationalism, will
intensify the split between Croatia and Serbia.
   The two are the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics and have
been fierce rivals since the country was created in 1918.
   Serbia indicated Friday it may follow Croatia and its northern
neighbor, Slovenia, in holding free elections in the next six
months.
   But a victory by pro-independence forces in Croatia would likely
bolster the Serbian Communists, who advocate a centralized
Yugoslavia and have used nationalism to help keep a firm grip on
power in their republic.
   Yugoslavia already has two distinctly different political
systems. There is one-party Communist rule in Serbia and multiparty
politics in Croatia and Slovenia.
   In free parliamentary elections last month in Slovenia, the
republic's reform Communists were defeated, but their popular
leader, Milan Kucan, won the presidency.
   Croatia's reform-minded Communist Party, renamed the Party for
Democratic Reform, won only 13 seats in the first round of
elections, and the centrist Coalition for National Accord won just
three.
   Tudjman, who ran his Western-style campaign under the slogan
``Croatia belongs to the Croatians,'' has expressed confidence his
party will cap its initial victory and that the new parliament will
elect him president.
   ``We need the second-round victory, after which we will devote
ourselves to the construction of new Croatia,'' he said.
   Tudjman believes Yugoslavia's six republics should be
independent states and establish relations with each other only if
common interests are involved.
   Croatia's reform Communists are more cautious. They say the
current federation is fine for now. If it fails to meet Croatia's
needs in the future, however, they say Yugoslavia should become a
confederation without central rule.
   Serbia's media, strongly influenced by the Communist Party, call
Tudjman a secessionist or sometimes even a fascist.
   Croatia's 450,000 Serb minority, which faced mass extermination
in the Croatian puppet state set up by Nazi Germany, recently
staged several rallies denouncing Tudjman's ideas.
   Serbs in Croatia say they would demand full autonomy for the
regions where they live if his party wins the elections.

   Five rockets slammed into the Afghan
capital of Kabul on Saturday, killing one person and wounding three
people, Radio Kabul reported.
   The rocket attack occured a day after Afghan President
Najibullah lifted a 15-month-old state of emergency.
   The radio broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, blamed the attack
on ``Pakistan-based extremists,'' apparently referring to
U.S.-backed rebels.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack.
   Afghan guerrillas, headquartered in Pakistan and Iran, have been
fighting for 12 years to topple the Soviet-style government in
Kabul.
   The United States sends the seven major rebel groups in Pakistan
about $500 million annually in military supplies. Moscow provides
about $5 billion a year to its allies in Kabul, according to
Western diplomats in Islamabad.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 at the
invitation of the pro-Soviet government of Babrak Karmal. By the
start of 1988 _ before Moscow agreed to withdraw troops _ some
103,000 Soviet troops and about 50,000 Afghan army troops were
pitted against some 200,000 guerrillas.
   The Soviets withdrew the last of their troops in February 1989,
but Moscow said military advisers would remain.
   Up to 15,000 Soviet troops were killed during the intervention.
The State Department says exact Afghan casualties are unavailable,
but it says there were 1 million Afghan deaths. There are a total
of about 5 million refugees, of whom about 3 million are in
Pakistan and 1.9 million in Iran.

<TEXT>
   Federal drug agents served warrants to confiscate
$17.6 million in South Florida financial institutions as a
nationwide drug money laundering crackdown focuses on suspicious
accounts, a spokesman said Saturday.
   Federal officials froze $400 million in more than 750 accounts
nationally three weeks ago as part of the long-running Operation
Polar Cap. Investigators have been working to pin down the origin
of the funds, said Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman John
Fernandes.
   The seizure warrants served Friday in South Florida, covering
$17.6 million, were for accounts in which investigators have
concluded that there was ``probable cause'' to believe the money
was drug proceeds, Fernandes said Saturday. He said he didn't have
any detail on what seizure orders might have been issued in other
parts of the country.
   The warrants were served on bank officers for 72 accounts at 20
South Florida banks _ a legal step in the process of transferring
the suspected drug cartel money to federal coffers. In all,
accounts had been frozen in 78 Miami banks.
   The government also could prosecute bankers and the account
holders after tracing the money, Fernandes said.
   ``If we show complicity on the part of a bank or bank official
or some representative of a corporation or a front corporation or
what have you, that would be a separate part of the civil action,''
the DEA spokesman said.
   Meanwhile, the account holders are preparing to fight the
freezing or loss of funds, with some arguing they were involved in
``flight capital'' _ sending of assets from troubled foreign
countries to the United States _ and not money laundering.
   ``It's the only way people in Colombia can have dollars in the
United States to avoid inflation and other problems with the
Colombian economy,'' said Fred Schwartz, an attorney for a
Colombian industrialist with $600,000 in frozen accounts.
   Schwartz and other attorneys say their clients bought dollars in
Latin America on the black market _ a huge pot of money swelled by
the cocaine trade _ without knowing the cash was drug-tainted.
   The money then was transferred to U.S. accounts, often in
violation of currency laws abroad, as a cushion against the
vagaries of Latin American economics and politics.
   Javier Murcio, a flight capital expert with DRI-McGraw Hill, a
Lexington, Mass., consulting firm, said the DEA seizures ``must
induce some nervousness on the part of these individuals.''
   But he doubted flight capital would be driven from Miami banks
because of the enforcement, saying, ``People who are going to take
it out of their countries will always do so regardless of the
circumstances.''
   Fernandes indicated the seizure warrants covered some drug money
that was laundered through foreign currency black markets before it
was deposited in U.S. banks.
   ``I wouldn't want to stereotype it,'' he said. ``Playing with
the black market is only one way of getting the (drug) money
through. The technology used is only limited to the imagination of
the money launderers.''
   The Justice Department obtained a court order April 16 in
Atlanta to freeze accounts in 173 banks in 22 states after
investigators estimated Colombia's Medellin cartel amassed $1.2
billion from cocaine sales from 1987 to early 1989.
   Federal officials believe $400 million was returned to the
United States to support drug trafficking.

   Nearly 140 masterpieces from two formidable
family collections, including a celebrated, $40.7 million
self-portrait by Pablo Picasso, are going on display Sunday at the
National Gallery of Art.
   Opening in the gallery's modernistic East Building is the first
and only U.S. exhibition of 85 old masters, impressionists,
post-impressionists and early modern works from the collection of
the late Swiss industrialist, Emil G. Buehrle.
   Appearing simultaneously in the gallery's West Building is the
entire collection of 54 paintings, watercolors and drawings from
the home of millionaire publisher Walter H. Annenberg in Rancho
Mirage, Calif., shown together for the first time on a national
tour that began last summer in Philadelphia.
   Gallery director J. Carter Brown called the twin exhibitions ``a
fabulous double-header'' and said that ``we may never see in our
lifetime a concentration of art of such quality and importance.''
   First lady Barbara Bush, wearing a white jacket and pearls,
attended a gallery reception in Annenberg's honor Wednesday night
and toured his collection with Brown as her personal guide. She is
said to be an admirer of French impressionist paintings.
   Brown said the Buehrle exhibit was drawn from 321 works _ many
of them rarely seen in public _ that comprise ``one of the greatest
private collections to have been created in the 20th century.''
   The 38 Italian, Dutch, French and Spanish artists represented in
the show range from Frans Hals and Francisco Goya to impressionists
Edouard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Edgar Degas, Paul Cezanne, Claude
Monet, Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh.
   Among the 20th century masters in the exhibit, titled ``The
Passionate Eye: Impressionist and Other Master Paintings from the
Collection of Emil G. Buehrle,'' are Henri Matisse, Georges Braque,
Picasso, Franz Marc and Wassily Kandinsky.
   Brown said Annenberg, a philanthropist, publisher and former
U.S. ambassador to Britain, and his wife, Leonore, had ``assembled
one of the world's greatest private collections of impressionist
and post-impressionist art.''
   The National Gallery show includes three recent Annenberg
acquisitions that did not appear in the Philadelphia exhibit,
Braque's ``The Studio,'' Henri Fantin-Latour's ``Asters and Fruit
on a Table'' and the Picasso self-portrait, ``Au Lapin Agile.''
   Annenberg bought the 1905 Picasso painting at Sotheby's in New
York last November for $40.7 million, the third most expensive
artwork ever sold at auction.
   Since he sold his publishing empire to Rupert Murdoch for $3
billion in 1988, the 82-year-old collector has accelerated his art
purchases amid intense speculation over the eventual fate of his
masterpieces.
   If Annenberg leaves his collection to a museum, the National
Gallery is considered a likely candidate, along with the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Philadelphia Museum of
Art and possibly the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
   
   
   Brown ducked a reporter's question last week about the National
Gallery's chances of acquiring the Annenberg collection, which
includes eight Cezannes, five van Goghs, six Monets and other
paintings by Degas, Gauguin, Matisse and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The
show also includes an Annenberg portrait by Andrew Wyeth and a
montage by Romare Bearden of the ``Roots'' television miniseries
that Annenberg commissioned for the cover of TV Guide.
   Americans will never have another chance to view the Buehrle
collection after its current world tour, unless they travel to the
family home in Zurich, Switzerland. When the tour ends, the family
says it will retire the collection from international lending.
   The Buehrle show, underwritten by Martin Marietta Corp., will
remain until July 15. It also will appear at the Montreal Museum of
Fine Arts, Aug. 3 through Oct. 14; the Yokohama Museum of Art in
Japan, Nov. 2 to Jan. 13, 1991; and the Royal Academy of Arts in
London, Feb. 1 to April 14.
   ``Masterpieces of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism: The
Annenberg Collection'' will appear at the National Gallery through
Aug. 5, and at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from Aug. 16
through Nov. 11. It will appear at New York's Metropolitan Museum
next summer.
   The exhibition is underwritten by the GTE Corp.

<HEAD>Lava Flow Continues Toward Ocean After Cutting Off Village Access</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAPANA, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lava from Kilauea Volcano cut off the
last road out of this coastal community Saturday and nearly
encircled the town's store and a church.
   Part of the lava flow was headed toward an area of sand dunes
about 225 yards from the ocean, according to Hawaii County Civil
Defense spokesman Bruce Butts.
   Another finger of lava was headed toward a park and was about 50
yards from the park boundary, he said.
   The Kalapana Store and Drive-Inn, the community's meeting place,
and the Kalapana Mauna Kea Congregational Church still were
standing although nearly encircled by lava, Butts said.
   Lava was filling a gulley behind the two buildings in the heart
of the village and was expected to eventually reach them, he said.
   The blazing hot lava has destroyed a total of 134 homes,
including 50 in the past month, since Kilauea's east rift zone
began erupting on Jan. 3, 1983.
   The historic Star-of-the-Sea Catholic Church, known for its
brightly painted murals, was moved to higher ground Friday before
lava cut off the escape route.
   Members of the Congregational church earlier decided not to move
their church, partly because of termite damage.
   ``If it's God's will that the building goes go, it's His will,''
said church moderator Bernice McKeague.
   Officials were concerned about a possible health threat when the
hot lava reaches the ocean's salt water, because that produces
steam clouds, known as laze, containing hydrochloric acid and other
potentially hazardous chemicals.
   ``Our main concern is the tradewinds,'' Butts said. ``As long as
there are tradewinds, the laze will be blown away.
   ``If winds shift, our concern mainly will be for the command
post and the people on the barricades,'' he said.
   ``We will play it by ear, and watch the wind situation, but if
there is a wind shift, we may have to move people.''
   U.S. Rep. Daniel Akaka, recently named to the U.S. Senate to
succeed the late Spark Matsunaga, attended a service with members
of the Congregational church Friday.
   He said he hopes federal aid will be approved, possibly within
the next week. He said he met with visiting representatives of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency before they returned to
Washington.

<HEAD>IRA Claims Responsibility For Failed Bomb Attack In Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility
Saturday for planting plastic explosives outside the British army
barracks in Hanover, West Germany, in an intended attack foiled by
a civilian and his German shephard.
   In a statement to Press Association, Britain's domestic news
agency, the IRA said: ``A number of devices containing a
substantial amount of plastic explosives were placed inside the
base after an active service unit penetrated the security fencing.''
   An unarmed civilian dog handler with his German shepherd broke
up the attack early Friday when he spotted three men who had cut a
hole in a fence at Langenhagen barracks. He challenged the men, who
fled after firing four shots at him.
   Seventy soldiers with the 1st Postal and Courier Regiment of the
Royal Engineers, who were sleeping in the barracks at the time,
were immediately ordered out. The barracks are only about 75 feet
from the perimeter fence.
   West German forensic experts examined the four bullets fired by
the terrorists.
   Dr. Hans-Jurgen Forster, spokesman for the West German federal
prosecutor, said they came from a AK-47 semi-automatic rifle, ``a
classic IRA weapon.''
   West German investigators confirmed that the explosives used in
the attack were Czechslovakian-made Semtex. A total of 104.5 pounds
were planted in two olive green rucksacks placed close to the
barracks building, they said.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the mainly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic under a socialist government.

   Freed hostage Frank Reed
pronounced himself in good health Saturday, saying ``I'm beautiful,
I'm OK.'' He said his kidnappers ``treated me fine'' the last six
months of his captivity and joked that ``room service was pretty
good.''
   His doctors said they were pleased with how he looked even
though his weight had dropped from about 185 pounds to about 140
now.
   ``Our early evaluations are good,'' said Brig. Gen. Robert W.
Poel, commander of the Malcolm Grow Air Force Medical Center.
   Reed, in a telephone interview with The Associated Press, said
he was looking forward to going home to Malden, Mass., on Tuesday
or Wednesday for the first time in eight years to see his
91-year-old mother, Leota Sprague, for the ``real celebration of
success.''
   The town north of Boston is planning a big celebration for him
and residents already have started hanging out yellow ribbons on
homes and buildings.
   But Poel, at a news conference, said he would be surprised if
Reed left by Wednesday and that his departure would not be until
the end of the week ahead at the earliest. ``Maybe a day or two
shorter or a day or two longer,'' he added.
   In the interview, Reed, 57, sounded in high spirits despite
being blindfolded and bound much of his more than 3{ years in
captivity and his weight loss. He was released last Monday in
Beirut by Lebanese kidnappers.
   ``So far everything is fine,'' he said. He added that he was
just getting life-giving muscles and that he needed vitamins. His
doctors said they were giving him vitamin supplements.
   ``Every muscle in my body is completely out of shape,'' Reed
said. ``When you stand up, you're going against the force of
gravity. I haven't even done that very much.''
   ``I've eaten quality food but haven't had much of it,'' he said.
``We used to joke _ John (McCarthy), Brian (Keenan) and I _ that
room service was pretty good when we got extra coffee, popcorn or
something.'' Reed was held hostage with McCarthy and Keenan at
varying times.
   Poel said Reed was decompressing and it was probably too early
to say whether he had any specific problems.
   ``His laboratory tests all look quite good,'' Poel said. ``He
shows a little bit of what you would expect of a man that has been
held in captivity for a prolonged period of time. He has lost a
great deal of weight. He's also tired. ... He needs to work at
recovering his strength.''
   Poel said it was too early to make a specific diagnosis of his
mental state but that Reed's ``spirits are great. He speaks with
vigor and is happy to be where he is. He is incisive. Ask a
question and he speaks out. His memory is great.''
   Poel said counselors planned to speak with Reed.
   Reed was being fed nutritional meals and dined on lobster by
candlelight Friday night with his wife and two grown daughters by a
previous marriage who have been staying with him. Saturday morning
he asked for pancakes for breakfast.
   He has been receiving visitors and on Saturday saw Peggy Say,
the sister of Terry Anderson, The Associated Press' chief middle
east correspondent and longest held hostage with more than five
years in captivity. Reed had spent some time with Anderson in
captivity.
   Ms. Say said that because Reed was obviously exhausted, she put
off any in-depth discussions about Anderson until next week.
   On Sunday, Reed planned to attend a brunch and news conference
sponsored by the humanitarian organization No Greater Love. It was
to include former hostages held in Lebanon and their families.
   Among those scheduled to meet with Reed were Keenan's two
sisters, Brenda Gillham and Elaine Spence, who arrived from London
on Friday night.
   Keenan, 39, an Irish teacher of English at the American
University of Beirut, was kidnapped April 11, 1986. McCarthy, 33, a
British television journalist, was kidnapped April 17, 1986.
   Reed, director of the private Lebanon International School in
Beirut, was kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986.
   He had disclosed earlier that he also he had been held with
Thomas Sutherland, an American University of Beirut dean.
   Reed arrived here Friday aboard an Air Force jetliner from
Wiesbaden, West Germany. The two daughters from a previous
marriage, Marilyn Langston, 33, and Jacqueline Reed, 28, went
aboard the plane for a brief private reunion.
   Reed's Syrian-born wife, Fahima, known as Fifi, and their
9-year-old son, Tarek, flew with him from Germany.
   On Friday he thanked his ``fellow Americans'' for still being
alive and pleaded for the release of ``my mates left behind'' _ the
remaining six Americans and nine other Westerners held by Islamic
militants in Lebanon.
   Robert Polhill, a fellow educator, was released in Beirut just
eight days before Reed.

   Here are excerpts of statements made
at Saturday's German unification talks in Bonn, from official texts.
   The Associated Press translated the remarks of Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. The remarks of West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher come from the official translation.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III:
   For we meet in recognition that a historical process is under
way: the unification of Germans in peace and freedom. Today, we
engage in an act of reconciliation _ of a people too long
separated, of a continent too long divided.
   In helping Germany achieve freedom and unity, I believe all the
states and peoples of Europe can be the winners. That should be our
aim. That is a vision that looks to the future, not to the past.
   ... A primary task of this group, therefore will be to arrive at
a formula by which we will terminate and transfer all remaining
Four Power rights and responsibilities to a fully sovereign Germany
_ a Germany united within the territory of the Federal Republic of
Germany, the German Democratic Republic, and Berlin. We must focus
our efforts on the substance of a final settlement, not on the
symbols of the past.
   ... Unification will have important implications for each of us
in our relations with Germany, as well as for Germany's place in
the new, evolving European order. The United States recognizes that
others among the four (powers) have legitimate interests that may
need to be addressed as part of the two-plus-four process. We
believe that this forum may be an appropriate place for discussions
of such issues, but it is our view that this forum should take
decisions only on those issues relevant to Four Power rights and
responsibilities.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze:
   We never had earlier _ and happily we never acquired _ any
allergy to the aspirations of the German people to unity. We are
for the right of Germans to self-determination. We believe that a
united Germany enters the family of European peoples as a
democratic and peace-loving state.
   ... Returning to the question of military-political status, I
would like to confirm our negative attitude to the membership of a
united Germany in NATO ... Such a decision directly touches our
security, would signify a brutal violation of the balance of forces
in Europe and would create a dangerous military-strategic
situation. For us, NATO remains that which it always was _ an
antagonistic military bloc.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>---</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher:
   Almost 45 years ago to the day a war ended in Europe that
claimed countless victims and caused immeasurable suffering. In
again expressing our mutual intention, as in the first words of the
Helsinki Final Act, `to contribute in Europe to peace, security,
justice and cooperation,' we are honoring the victims of war and
tyranny.
   ... Poland's participation in discussions on the border question
will point the way for the recognition in international law by the
united Germany of Poland's western border.
   Far-sighted statesmen and courageous peoples have given us the
chance to shed the last remnants of the war and postwar period and
to determine the architecture of a common European house, the
structure of a peaceful European order.
   ... We have difficult problems to solve. However, if we are all
willing not only to defend our interests but also to respect the
interests of our partners, then we will find solutions. Our
responsibility for the future of Europe demands resolution and a
sense of proportion.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Saturday
the United States should delay withdrawal of its short-range
nuclear forces in Europe until after the Soviet Union has pulled
out its nuclear weapons.
   President Bush announced Thursday that the administration had
abandoned plans to modernize the existing Lance missile, a
short-range nuclear missile based in Europe and targeted on East
Germany.
   The collapse of the Warsaw Pact had rendered the missile
obsolete and the West Germans and members of the U.S. Congress had
opposed plans to upgrade the system.
   Cheney, in an interview with Cable News Network's ``Newsmaker''
program, said the United States should wait before withdrawing the
some 700 now-obsolete missiles and the approximately 1,500
nuclear-tipped artillery shells in Europe.
   ``Until the Soviets have removed their nuclear forces,
short-range nuclear forces, in East Germany, it makes no sense for
us to take ours out of West Germany,'' Cheney said in the interview.
   The Pentagon chief said only when the Soviets remove all their
forces from Eastern Europe ``then I think we'll have a high degree
of confidence, then we can reduce our own forces.''
   Cheney is scheduled to meet this week in Canada with NATO
defense ministers and is expected to discuss the issue of
short-range nuclear forces. Bush said Thursday that the 16-member
NATO alliance should meet in late June or July to consider a
political and military strategy.
   In the interview, Cheney also described his vision of the future
U.S. military in Europe that would include fewer Army divisions and
greater reliance on reserve forces.
   In addition, ``you can probably dual-base some of your air
squadrons, some of them back here in the United States with bases
in Europe that they would move to in wartime,'' Cheney said.

   Flooding closed highways and forced scores of people from their
homes Saturday in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas, and the high water
from last week's heavy rain crumbled levees and threatened at least
one dam.
   ``There's water, water everywhere,'' said Gary Talley, spokesman
for the Arkansas Office of Emergency Services. ``To say we have
extensive flooding is pretty accurate and it's only going to get
worse.''
   Texas emergency officials evacuated more than a dozen families
in two rural counties south of Dallas overnight as levees along the
Trinity River were washed out by record high water.
   The river at Trinidad, about 60 miles southeast of Dallas, was
receding slowly after rising to almost 20 feet over the flood stage
of 28 feet early Saturday, Henderson County emergency management
coordinator Travis Roberts said.
   Trinidad police dispatcher Delois Langford said Trinidad and
nearby Malakoff were not expected to be flooded, although 10
families were evacuated from an area near the river.
   The Trinity crested at Dallas on Thursday, forcing hundreds from
their homes. Many were still out of their homes Saturday as the
river began to recede slowly there. At midday Saturday, the river
at Dallas had fallen only 3 feet and was still 14 feet above flood
stage.
   Texas' death toll from last week's storms rose to six. A total
of 12 Texas deaths have been blamed on the weather in the past
weeks.
   More than 60 southeastern Oklahoma highways were under water
Saturday and the number was expected to significantly increase as
more water was released from overfilled reservoirs.
   In far eastern Oklahoma, the dam on Lake Frances on the Arkansas
border threatened to break, which would send a torrent of water
downstream into Flint Creek, Ark., and other small towns. A large
chunk of the dam washed away Friday, and giant cracks appeared in
the remaining concrete as the dam shifted 6 to 8 feet.
   About 100 downstream residents were evacuated, but were allowed
to return as the water level behind the dam continued to fall.
   ``The worst conditions at Lake Frances have passed pending
further flooding from future rain,'' said Harold Springer of the
Oklahoma Water Resources Board.
   Along the Texas-Oklahoma border, Lake Texoma was almost 4 feet
above its spillway Saturday, with about 30 mobile homes and 24
permanent structures under water around the huge lake.
   The Army Corps of Engineers was releasing as much as 126,000
cubic feet per second from Texoma, but Corps spokesman Edward
Engelke said the reservoir still wouldn't crest until Monday,
possibly at 5 feet above the spillway. The previous record was 3
feet.
   Lakeshore resident Jerry Russell spent Friday filling sand bags.
   ``I drew three chalk lines up my driveway,'' Russell said. ``The
first was for worry, the second panic, and the third, for sale.''
   Lake Texoma's rising water cut off all but one two-lane road
connecting Marshall County, Okla., to the rest of the world
Saturday. Some 200 Marshall County residents had been displaced but
no injuries were reported.
   Between 25 and 30 families were marooned in one residential
area, said civil defense director John Martin. ``There's no way in
and no way out'' over land, Martin said.
   The residents, mostly elderly, retired people, don't want to
leave.
   ``You know how it is with some of the elderly, they want to stay
there to protect their homes. It's all they've got,'' Martin said.
   High water from northwestern Arkansas began creeping into
low-lying areas of central Arkansas along the bulging Arkansas
River on Saturday.
   Sections of several state highways and other roadways all along
the river were under water, and industrial and commercial
businesses near the river from Dardanelle 60 miles southeast to
Little Rock will be threatened as the water rises slowly toward
crests through Wednesday, authorities said.
   Water was 3 feet deep Saturday on Rogers Avenue, a main
thoroughfare at Fort Smith, Ark., where the river was expected to
crest at 13 feet above the 22-foot flood stage, said Talley of the
emergency services office. Residents had evacuated from more than
50 flooded homes in surrounding Sebastian County, he said.
   Eighteen families were evacuated at the town of Toad Suck in
Perry County, where sandbagging operations were halted, and seven
families were evacuated in the Lollie Bottoms community near
Mayflower, he said.
   National Guardsmen helped city work crews in sandbagging
operations that began about midmorning Saturday in North Little
Rock, where water had reached a residential area, said Todd Larson,
the city's director of commerce and governmental affairs.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton declared 27 counties disaster areas
Friday.
   President Bush declared 12 Texas counties disaster areas Friday.
   The flooding in the three states was caused by three days of
torrential rain that followed an unusually rainy spring.
   Northern Texas has had 22.06 inches of rainfall in the first
four months of 1990, the most since 1922. As much as 7 inches of
rain fell within 24 hours in some areas.
   The Red Cross calculated Friday that more than 2,300 Texas
families lost property in floods. More than 700 homes were
destroyed and 1,600 others damaged, the Red Cross said.

<HEAD>Noriega Banker: `If I Say Anything ... I'm Dead'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manuel Noriega's self-described personal
banker worried two years ago that he'd be killed if he testified
before the U.S. Senate about the Panamanian ruler's financial
dealings, a tape recorded conversation shows.
   ``If I say anything about Noriega and it's reported by the
press, I'm dead,'' Amjad Awan said in a secretly recorded tape
played Friday in his federal drug money-laundering trial. ``He
knows that I know everything.''
   The banker, uneasy at being subpoenaed to testify before the
Senate in September 1988, said he could trace the flow of the
dictator's cash to accounts outside Panama.
   ``It's a question of money, and I know exactly where he has
what,'' Awan unwittingly told an undercover agent. ``And no matter
how much he likes me, how much of a friend I am ... when it comes
to money, when his back is towards the wall, you know.''
   The tape concluded the 15th week of government testimony that
Awan, four fellow bankers at the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit
and Commerce International and a Colombian laundered cash they knew
to be drug proceeds.
   Awan had no reason to suspect the friend he was chatting with at
a plush Miami restaurant was an agent. For more than a year, Awan
had helped Robert Musella move large amounts of cash from the
United States to secret overseas accounts.
   Musella, however, was the identity assumed by Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Robert Mazur.
   He told Awan on tapes already played at the trial that the money
was coming from some of Colombia's largest cocaine dealers. Awan
said he didn't care, that it wasn't up to him to judge the morality
of where the money came from.
   Awan and the other defendants maintain their innocence. The
bankers say they were victims of the Luxembourg bank management's
passion to expand and attract new capital.
   Two divisions of the bank _ one of the world's largest private
financial institutions, pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges
when trial began in January. In a plea bargain, the Luxembourg bank
forfeited $15 million in frozen assets and interest.
   On the tape, Awan is heard questioning how the bank's
high-powered Washington lawyer, former Secretary of State Clark
Clifford, was handling the Senate subpoena.
   Awan expressed his fear that Clifford was about to sell him out
to protect the Luxembourg bank and Clifford's bank, First American
Bank, from scandal.
   Awan said the Luxembourg bank's board was so anxious to keep him
from talking and avoid scandal that it even urged him to get out of
the United States, to transfer from his Miami office possibly to
Paris.
   The banker also predicted the bank would duck the subpoena by
telling the subcommittee that no Noriega banking records existed in
this country and that Noriega wouldn't surrender the bank's records
in Panama.
   Clifford later gave a similar response to Sen. John Kerry, the
subcommittee's chairman.
   Records seized when the bankers were arrested showed at least
$600,000 of Noriega's money flowed from Panama to Europe through
BCCI accounts at Clifford's Washington bank.
   Awan told the subcommittee in September 1988 that he once
handled $23 million in Noriega's personal accounts and said he
deposited money for Noriega in accounts at First American Bank,
where Clifford was president.
   Clifford has denied any involvement by the Luxembourg bank in
First American, other than some overlapping shareholders.
   But on the tape, Awan said the bank owned First American despite
a series of shareholders designed to conceal the bank's ownership.
   ``The truth of the matter is,'' he said, ``the bank belongs to
BCCI.''

   Rain was scattered over much of the eastern half of the nation
Saturday, but rainfall was generally light.
   At midday, showers extended from south-central Kansas across
south-central Nebraska, over north-central Illinois, from Ohio and
eastern Kentucky across western Pennsylvania, and from northeastern
New York state across northern and central New England.
   Showers and thunderstorms, some with the potential to become
severe, reached from Maryland and Delaware across Virginia, North
and South Carolina, much of Georgia, southeastern Alabama, the
Florida Panhandle and northwestern Florida.
   Showers were scattered along the central and lower Texas Gulf
Coast.
   Heaviest rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was 0.70
of an inch at Massena, N.Y., and 0.50 of an inch at Dothan, Ala.,
the National Weather Service said.
   Serious flooding continued in parts of Texas, Oklahoma and
Arkansas as a result of last week's heavy rain.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38 at
Augusta, Maine, to 101 at El Cajon, Calif.
   Saturday's low for the Lower 48 states was 28 at Duluth, Minn.

<TEXT>
   Former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said
Saturday he will challenge Shimon Peres for leadership of the
left-leaning Labor Party, and polls indicated that Rabin could lead
the party to victory.
   A poll published Friday in the mass circulation Yediot Ahronot
newspaper showed Rabin defeating caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir of the right-wing Likud bloc by a 2-1 margin if direct
elections for Israel's leader were held.
   Israeli voters chose political parties and not candidates, but a
campaign to reform the electoral system and institute direct
elections has been gaining substantial momentum.
   Rabin's challenge to party leader Shimon Peres was widely
expected after Peres failed to form a coalition government last
week, leaving Shamir in a position to head Israel's next
government. If Shamir is unable to form a coalition, elections
could be held.
   ``I believe that after a long period and several elections, the
time has come to have a soul searching to decide who can lead the
party in the next elections with a better chance to win them,''
Rabin said.
   Asked whether he was a candidate for leadership, Rabin replied:
``I believe that I, or maybe others'' could lead the party.
   ``I believe that there is a need for change,'' he added.
   Rabin said a Likud government ``can cause damage to Israel in
the fields of the peace process, international relations, in their
policies in the (occupied) territories, the settlements.''
   Calls for a change in party leadership have been echoed by other
Labor legislators and Rabin's popularity seems to be growing within
the party and the nation.
   Rabin served as army chief of staff during the 1967 Middle East
war, when Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza
Strip from Egypt. He also served as prime minister from 1974 to
1977.
   He was defense minister in the Likud-Labor joint government from
1984 to March of this year, when Labor collapsed the government to
protest Likud's refusal to accept U.S. proposals to advance the
peace process.
   Rabin's tough policy in handling the Palestinian uprising has
won him widespread popularity.
   The poll in the Yediot Ahronot daily, was conducted May 1-2 by
the Dahaf agency and showed that 60 percent of the 515 people
questioned prefered Rabin for prime minister while only 32 percent
chose Shamir.
   Pollster Mina Zemech said the poll examined the voting
preferences of Jews, but excluded settlers and people living on
communal farms. She said the margin of error was 4 percent to 5
percent.
   Also Saturday, Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian
after Arab protesters in a West Bank refugee camp threw stones and
a firebomb at troops, the army said.
   Mohammed Shaker al-Masri, 25, was struck in the heart with a
bullet and died at Tulkarum hospital, Arab reports and hospital
officials said.
   Al-Masri's death brought to 682 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israelis during the 29-month-old rebellion against the
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Forty-three Israelis
have also died in the violence.
   Palestinians have killed about 210 of their fellow Arabs, mainly
on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities.

   Municipal elections were held in this
small northwest Texas town Saturday, but more people were casting
bait than ballots.
   That's because Saturday also was Fish Day.
   Once a year since the 1920s, everything has shut down as the
locals head north to Lake Kemp to cast their lines.
   Fish Day officially is the first Monday in May, but most folks
now stretch it into a three-day weekend.
   ``It's pretty well deserted, except around the courthouse where
the election is going on,'' saidCity Election Secretary Mary Alice
Smith. ``And Monday, it will be completely deserted.''
   Ms. Smith said the conflict began two years ago when state
officials decided local elections should be held on the first
Saturday of May.
   Still, most of Seymour's approximately 3,500 residents manage to
make the best of it, she said. Many cast absentee ballots before
they head for the lake. And those who stay behind get to share in
eating the catch.
   On the ballot: a sales tax to fund a hospital district.

   At Saturday's commencement at the Rhode
Island School of Design, 98-year-old Howard A. Trenn, Class of
1915, led the line of about 270 degree recipients.
   All had been awarded diplomas upon graduating, some as long as
82 years ago, but none had been granted a certified college degree.
That's because until 1944, the school wasn't fully accredited. Now
it offers the required liberal arts curriculum to make it a
full-fledged four-year college.
   Like Trenn, who had studied mechanical design, most of the
pre-accreditation graduates who lined up for honorary degrees
Saturday used their schooling to earn their livings in art and
design.
   The oldest living pre-accreditation graduate, painter Mary
Crosby, 102 and Class of 1908, was unable to attend. But she was to
be given her honorary degree later by school President Thomas F.
Schutte.
   The 113-year-old school sent out 670 invitations _ complete with
mortar boards and tassels. Many former students who could not
attend the commencement wrote to ask that their new degrees be sent
to them.
   ``You symbolize the heart and spirt of RISD,'' Peter Freeman,
chairman of the school's board of trustees, told those honored, to
the applause of about 500 friends and relatives. ``You are the
living proof that all the energy expended to educate budding
artists is worth it.''

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people
gathered on a sunny hillside Saturday to remember the co-founder of
Czechoslovakia, 71 years after he was killed in a plane crash.
   Under Communist rulers who were swept out of power in last
winter's peaceful revolution, the republic's co-founder, Gen. Milan
R. Stefanik, and its first president, Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, were
virtually taboo figures accorded almost no public honors.
   On Saturday, President Vaclav Havel joined tens of thousands of
people attended the nationally televised ceremony at Bradlo, the
site where Stefanik crashed in 1919. The town is some 60 miles
north of the regional Slovak capital of Bratislava.
   ``We gathered here ... to renew the tradition of annual national
pilgrimage to Bradlo, a tradition which was created spontaneously
by our people in the first Czechoslovak republic ... and which was
interrupted by our last regime,'' Milan Cic, premier of the Slovak
regional government, said after a wreath-laying ceremony.
   The ceremony was used as a time to emphasize the unity between
the Czech and Slovak people who constitute the dominant ethnic
groups within the nation.
   Those ties were strained in recent weeks by a debate over a new
name for the country. Last month, Slovaks pushed Parliament to
change the republic's name to ``The Czech and Slovak Federative
Republic'' to emphasize the distinct role that Slovaks have played
in the state.
   Stefanik ``understood that it was necessary to unite the destiny
of the Slovak nation with the destiny of the Czechs. He understood
this as well as Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, who knew that it was the
only way to create a strong state here, a state which the Czech
lands could never become without the Slovaks,'' Havel told the
crowd.
   The era of ``psuedo-independence and federated totality'' has
ended, Havel said, referring to the Communist past. ``Now, the era
of brotherly cooperation of two autonomous nations is beginning.''
   The languages of the two groups are very similar, but their
history and traditions vary. The Czech region of Bohemia was one of
the first places in Europe to undergo industrialization, while
Slovakia is far more rural and still preserves peasant customs.

   A homeless woman who allegedly tried to sell a
stolen car radio back to its owner was beaten to death with a
baseball bat Saturday by the irate robbery victim, police said.
   The killer jumped into his car and sped off after the beating
outside a restaurant, said police Sgt. Norris Hollomon.
   Hollomon said the initial account was based on reports from
witnesses, and police were waiting for an autopsy before officially
calling it a homicide.
   He said the incident began when Theresa Thomas, 35, walked into
the restaurant trying to sell a car radio she was carrying. A man
eating breakfast inside recognized the radio as coming from his car
and began arguing with her, witnesses told police.
   The man went outside, checked his car and found the radio
missing, Hollomon said. He went back in the restaurant after the
woman, and the pair began arguing again.
   The argument spilled into the street outside the eatery, where
witnesses told police they saw the man go into his trunk and pull
out a baseball bat, Hollomon said. Witnesses said two other men
helped the bat-wielding man beat the woman.

<TEXT>
   For the first time in three decades,
opposition parties are being allowed to apply for legal standing to
challenge the ruling party.
   At least five opposition parties had formally registered as of
Friday, state television reported Saturday. Registration is the
first step toward legalization.
   Presidential and legislative elections are to take place by the
year's end, but a date has not yet been set.
   State television, which generally ignores anti-government
protests or statements by critics, showed film of news conferences
of two opposition groups on Saturday night.
   The opposition leaders themselves were not heard, but an
announcer listed some of their complaints.
   The ruling Democratic Party has dominated this West African
nation since independence from France in 1960. Opposition parties
were legal under the nation's constitution, but none had been
allowed to operate.
   The change in policy came this week, when President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny on Thursday approved a recommendation from his
party to allow the opposition groups to register.
   He acted after several weeks of violent protests, triggered by
austerity measures. Demonstrators initially opposed the imposition
of wage cuts and increased taxes but then began calling for the
president's removal.
   The demonstrations included stoning and burning dozens of
government vehicles, buses and schools. One student was killed.

   Police on Saturday arrested 16 alleged
Moslem militants in southern Egypt, continuing a crackdown in which
16 of the fundamentalists have been killed and hundreds detained,
officials said.
   A police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
16 men detained in Beni Suif, 75 miles south of Cairo, were members
of the Jihad organization. The same group claimed responsibility
for the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
   The suspects were arrested under emergency laws in effect since
Sadat's death. The police source said no charges were filed.
   The arrests raised to 44 the number of militants arrested over
the last two days.
   On Friday, 28 militants were arrested for allegedly planning
attacks on police stations in Cairo and its suburb of Giza,
Interior Minister Abdel-Halim Moussa said in an interview scheduled
for publication Sunday in the state-owned Al-Ahram newspaper.
   He also confirmed that 16 Moslem militants were killed in April
clashes with police and hundreds detained in the southern provinces
of el-Minya, Assiut and Fayoum.
   Police said the Jihad organization was also responsible for a
series of attacks on police stations in the city of Assiut, 235
miles south of Cairo, immediately following the assassination of
Sadat.
   About 80 people, mostly policemen, were killed and 156 injured
in the attacks and subsequent rioting. The government said the
riots were designed to spark a nationwide uprising to overthrow
Egypt's secular government and establish an Islamic fundamentalist
regime.
   The latest crackdown on religious extremists has followed weeks
of attacks in southern Egypt on members of Egypt's Coptic Christian
minority.
   About one-tenth of the country's 55 million inhabitants are
Copts.

<HEAD>Radioactive Waste Leaking in National Marine Sanctuary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The richest ocean wildlife sanctuary on the
West Coast is threatened by a large radioactive waste dump piled
high with corroded barrels leaking plutonium and cesium, according
to a new federal report.
   Many of the corroding, 55-gallon barrels dumped between 1946 and
1970 in the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary
wildlife sanctuary have burst from water pressure, according to the
study.
   The federal study was reported in the San Francisco Examiner's
Sunday edition.
   Yet more than 20 years after the government acknowledged that at
least 47,500 barrels of U.S. atomic lab and industrial wastes lie
in or adjacent to the sanctuary, the site remains virtually
unstudied for its effects on marine life, said the report by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   The report urges further study of possible radioactive
contamination of commercial fisheries of Pacific herring, Dover
sole, rockfish, sablefish and Dungeness crab and hefty rockfish
sports catches.
   The report was prepared under an agreement between the
Environmental Protection Agency and NOAA. EPA has authority for
placing sites on the Superfund, the national priorities list of the
worst toxic dumps. NOAA, a branch of the U.S. Department of
Commerce, is the trustee for marine resources under Superfund.
   Two years ago, a contractor to the EPA rated the Farallon
Islands Radioactive Waste Dump as ``high priority'' for
investigation for Superfund.
   But no action has been taken by EPA, and now NOAA is pushing EPA
to make an assessment of the potential danger of the dump on the
marine life.
   ``We've started to dictate our own direction to projects that we
think need our attention,'' said Jim Bybee, Northern California
environmental coordinator for NOAA's National Marine Fisheries
   In Southern California, NOAA, which operates the nation's marine
sanctuaries, filed notice of intent to sue chemical and petroleum
companies for polluting bays and the ocean with DDT and heavy
metals.
   Once in the environment, plutonium can last for hundreds of
thousands of years. Its half-life is 24,360 years, and the rule of
thumb is that it takes about 10 half-lives before it decays to
background levels.
   In past studies, the sediments at the Farallones have shown
higher than normal levels of long-lived and dangerous plutonium and
cesium _ possibly more than 1,000 times expected background levels.
   Sole, rockfish and sablefish _ which are eaten by humans _ feed
on worms and tiny shrimp that feed in these sediments and are most
likely accumulating the radioactivity, scientists say.
   The Farallones marine ecosystem supports the largest population
of seabirds south of Alaska and an abundance of fish, invertebrates
and marine mammals.

   More than 10,000 refugees have fled
fighting between guerrillas and government forces in northwestern
Cambodia, relief officials said Saturday.
   The Cambodian refugees arrived at guerrilla-controlled refugee
camps on the Thai-Cambodian border in April, said aid officials in
the Thai frontier town of Aranyaprathet. They spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Official Cambodian radio has said 37,000 refugees have returned
from the Thai-Cambodian border to government-held parts of the
northwestern province of Banteay Meachey. It did not say exactly
when they returned.
   A transcript of the report seen in Bangkok Saturday said the
government offered the refugees 6,000 acres of farmland if they
returned. It was not clear from the report if the refugees had
previously lived in refugee camps or in the northwest.
   But aid officials said there was no sign of people leaving the
refugee camps to return to Cambodia.
   ``We have not seen any increase in people going back. In fact,
just the opposite, people are fleeing the fighting to the border,''
said one official.
   He said most of the more than 10,000 people who fled Cambodia in
April arrived at the sprawling site 2 camp near the border. The
camp houses almost half of the 300,000 Cambodians living in refugee
camps in Thailand.
   Since September, there has been heavy fighting between forces of
the Vietnam-backed government and guerrillas in northwestern
Cambodia.
   The start of the rainy season this month is expected to bring
another round of guerrilla attacks in the 11-year-old civil war.

   Salvadoran rebel leaders and representatives
of nine political parties, including the rightist governing party,
met Saturday in Mexico City.
   The meeting, held to discuss the progress of U.N.-sponsored
peace talks, stemmed from accords signed last month in Geneva
calling for negotiations between the government and the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front.
   ``This meeting is an exchange of opinions about the peace
negotiations,'' rebel leader Dagoberto Gutierrez said.
   The rebel delegation was headed by Shafik Handal and German
Cienfuegos, both members of the rebels' military high command.
   The political party leaders included Guillermo Ungo, El
Salvador's most prominent leftist leader, and Armando Calderon,
president of the governing Republican National Alliance, or Arena.
   Ungo said the next government-rebel meeting ``could be held
possibly May 15 in Venezuela.''
   Ungo said the party leaders had met with rightist President
Alfredo Cristiani earlier in the week to get the government's point
of view on the progress of the peace negotiations.
   At least 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in
the decade-old insurgency between the rebels and a succession of
U.S.-backed governments.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Exxon Corp. and its
shipping company have convinced a federal judge that criminal
charges stemming from the nation's largest oil spill are too
complicated to be heard as soon June 18.
   U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland has postponed the trial
indefinitely.
   The June 18 date was chosen to comply with the federal speedy
trial rule, which requires cases to be heard within a certain time
following indictment.
   Exxon and Exxon Shipping Co. are charged with two felonies and
three misdemeanors.
   Felony counts accuse the company of allowing an incompetent crew
to operate the Exxon Valdez on March 23 and 24, 1989. The
misdemeanor counts are for alleged violations of the federal Clean
Water, Refuse and Migratory Bird Treaty acts.
   Motions filed by Exxon attorneys argue that most of the charges
have not been used in oil-spill situations.
   Holland agreed. In a motion signed Wednesday, he said Exxon
demonstrated ``that this prosecution involves novel questions of
fact and law, and that there is an extraordinary volume of data to
be digested by both the government and Exxon.''
   Holland asked prosecutors and defense attorneys to propose a new
trial date by June 11.
   The case stems from the March 24, 1989, wreck of the tanker
Exxon Valdez, which struck a charted reef shortly after midnight
and spewed nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil into
Prince William Sound.
   An Anchorage jury in March rejected charges that former Exxon
skipper Joseph Hazelwood was drunk when the grounding occurred.
   According to testimony, chief mate James Kunkel said he warned
Hazelwood that the seaman who took the helm on the disastrous
voyage needed ``extra supervision'' for any task he took on.
   The seaman, Robert Kagan, was under the supervision of third
mate Gregory Cousins, who testified that Kagan had under-steered
the Exxon Valdez, failing to turn hard enough to avoid the
grounding.

   A colt named Unbridled ran to a 3{-length
victory Sunday in the 116th Kentucky Derby, giving a 92-year-old
lady named Frances A. Genter her first Derby victory in 50 years of
racing.
   Unbridled, ridden by Craig Perret, took the lead in the home
stretch and covered the 1\-mile course in 2:02 _ the 10th fastest _
to beat second-favored Summer Squall by 3{ lengths. Pleasant Tap
was six lengths back and three lengths in front of Video Ranger.
The favorite, Mister Frisky, was eighth.
   ``Today was payday,'' said a jubilant Perret, who finished
second on Bet Twice in 1987 and third on Awe Inspiring in 1989.
   For Unbridled, the Derby was his second victory in five starts
this year and his fourth triumph in 11 career outings. He paid
$23.60, $7.80 and $5.80 while earning $581,000 from a purse of
$756,000.
   Summer Squall returned $3.80 and $3.80 while Pleasant Tap,
ridden by Kent Desormeaux, was $12 to show.
   The order of finish after Video Ranger were Silver Ending,
Killer Diller, Land Rush, Mister Frisky, Thirty Six Red, Power
Lunch, pace-setting Real Cash, Dr. Bobby A., Pendleton Ridge, Burnt
Hills and Fighting Fantasy.
   Trainer Carl Nafzger called the race for Miss Genter, who had a
wheelchair nearby. Her smile widened, and Nafzger put his arms
around her and gave her a big kiss when Unbridled crossed the
finish line.
   Said the owner: ``I couldn't see the race, so Carl made the call
for me. He said, `He's sixth, he's fifth, he's going to win it.'
   ``We're No. 1,'' she said.

   Negotiators for striking Greyhound drivers and
the bus line recessed negotiations Saturday after a nine-hour
bargaining session failed to produce a new contract in the 2-month
walkout.
   The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service said both sides
were reviewing proposals and that mediators hoped to schedule new
talks within a few days.
   The talks were the first in the walkout since mid-March and came
a day after the company reported a $56 million loss for the first
three months this year.
   Much of Saturday's session was devoted to a review of the
company's financial situation and how it would impact a potential
contract, said a source close to negotiations. Money problems made
the bargaining process ``extremely difficult,'' the source said.
   The lack of another scheduled meeting ``is not a good sign,''
the source said, noting negotiators had originally talked of
possibly meeting Sunday and Monday as well.
   A four-hour round of morning negotiations, which mostly involved
each side talking separately with federal mediators, produced
``very little'' progress, union president Edward M. Strait said
after labor and management broke separately for lunch.
   ``We're feeling the process out right now,'' Strait said.
``We're hopeful we'll reach a settlement.''
   Greyhound Vice President Anthony P. Lannie, the company's top
negotiator, also said ``nothing's happened so far,'' but indicated
that was because the two sides had spent most of the time in the
morning session with mediators.
   The negotiators left by a basement exit after the afternoon
session, avoiding reporters.
   Lannie and Strait are trying to settle disputes over wages, job
security and seniority issues for the 6,300 striking drivers and
3,000 clerical and maintenance workers who walked out March 2.
   Union spokesman Nick Nichols said striking drivers were hopeful
a new contract could be reached soon because there appeared to be
less ``acrimony and tension'' between the two sides.
   Strait, head of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local
Unions, and Lannie met with Bernard E. DeLury, director of the
mediation service, and two other federal mediators. Each side
brought along a team of negotiators.
   Nichols said the strike ``has not been easy on either side,''
noting union members have been receiving $50 a week in strike
benefits.
   The walkout halted intercity bus service in nearly half of the
10,000 communities Greyhound serves. Greyhound, the only nationwide
bus line, has said it has since restored about 83 percent of its
normal service.
   But on Friday, the company said it had suffered a $55.8 million
loss in the January-March quarter, compared with a $14.4 million
loss in the first quarter of 1989. It turned a profit of under $1
million last year.
   The company blamed $20 million of this year's first-quarter loss
on security for the shootings, bomb threats and other violent
incidents that have occurred since the strike began nine weeks ago.
   ``Clearly, the information verifies what we have thought for
some time _ that the strike was being very effective and it was
important to get back to the table,'' Nichols said.
   A source close to the process said the company's financial
situation might mean both sides ``are going to have to be creative
about the seniority and money areas.''
   Citing the violence, the company withdrew from negotiations in
mid-March. There have been more than 30 shootings at buses and
terminals since the strike began.
   The union has strongly denied any involvement with the violence
and supported prosecution for those involved. It said union members
also were the victims of violence. A striking driver was crushed to
death on the second day of the strike by a bus driven by a
replacement driver.
   The company's last offer was for $63 million in wage hikes over
three years, although the union contends the bus line is inflating
the figure because the bus line wants to link pay increases to
corporate performance, such as increased ridership.
   Drivers, who earn an average of $24,743 a year, are trying to
recover some of the wage and benefit concessions they have given
the company over the past decade.
   Besides wages, the two sides also need to resolve a dispute over
the replacement drivers Greyhound has hired since the strike began.
The company wants to let those 2,500 drivers keep their jobs and
put a like amount of union drivers on a waiting list; the union
wants its members to keep their jobs and retain seniority over
replacements.
   There are also several disputes over work rules and grievance
procedures.
   Greyhound's financial statement Friday said it was developing a
financial restructuring plan.
   The bus line had maintained it had sufficient cash to withstand
the strike and would make a $9.75 million debt interest payment due
May 15.
   But the company said Friday that it would miss that payment. It
also said it missed lease and other payments due April 30.
   The company also said it expects to lose money in April, May and
possibly June before returning to profitability.
   Greyhound already laid off about 270 mechanics last month.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Saturday rejected
Latvia's declaration of independence and threatened the Baltic
republic with unspecified political, economic and administrative
measures if it doesn't reverse its course, Tass reported.
   The Soviet president's decision came one day after Latvia's
parliament adopted the independence declaration and was announced
late Saturday night on Latvian television by Alfreds Rubiks, the
republic's Communist Party chief. Rubiks' remarks were reported
early Sunday by Tass, the official Soviet news agency.
   The Latvian legislators had called for a slow transition to
independence and for negotiations with Moscow to avoid the sharp
economic sanctions the Soviet Union imposed on neighboring
Lithuania, which declared its independence March 11.
   Rubiks spoke by telephone with Gorbachev earlier Saturday and
said the Soviet leader considered the attempt by the Latvians to
portray their decision as different from Lithuania's was
``groundless,'' Tass reported.
   ``The president of the U.S.S.R. considers that the declaration
that was passed May 4 by the Latvian parliament on the restoration
of independence of the Latvian republic signifies a violation of
constitutional norms and is leading toward the breakdown of
governmental ties of the republics of the U.S.S.R.,'' Rubiks quoted
Gorbachev as saying.
   Gorbachev emphasized negotiations are possible only under the
guidelines of the Soviet Constitution and that negotiations can
only begin after a reversal of the declaration of independence,
Tass quoted Rubiks as saying.
   The news agency quoted Rubiks as saying that if the republic
ignores the Soviet Constitution, the president reserves the right
to take political, economic and administrative measures in response.
   He did not elaborate on what measures Gorbachev might take. In
mid-April, the Soviet leader slapped an economic embargo on
Lithuania for its pro-independence moves, cutting off all oil and
sharply curtailing natural gas and other key supplies to the
republic.
   Gorbachev's decision on Latvia was not broadcast on national
Soviet TV Saturday night, and he did not make any reference to it
in a public appearance in Moscow earlier in the day.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said he is still
waiting for Moscow to begin talks with his representatives, even
after he endorsed the idea of slowing the drive for independence.
   On May 15, Lithuania is expected to exhaust its reserve supplies
of oil, natural gas and other raw materials, its deputy prime
minister, Algirdas Brazauskas, said.
   On Monday, Lithuania will decide whether to retaliate by cutting
off its supplies of meat and dairy products to Moscow and
Leningrad, Brazauskas said.
   Gediminas Vagnorius, a Lithuanian lawmaker, said Saturday the
Soviet embargo has forced 12,500 people out of work in the
industrial, construction and transportation sectors, although many
have been transferred to other needed jobs.
   The independence declaration by Latvia's Supreme Soviet
parliament on Friday was greeted with fireworks and jubilant crowds
danced in the streets of the capital, Riga.
   The vote for independence was 138-0, with one abstention and one
lawmaker absent. But 57 deputies did not vote in protest, and
Rubiks and another anti-independence deputies walked out of the
hall to show their displeasure.
   In a message to Gorbachev, the deputies said the declaration
``opens the door to a transition period _ a period of close
dialogue ... close cooperation and wide political, economic and
human contacts.'' Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov had even said
low level negotiations with Moscow would begin May 15.
   Rubiks predicted the declaration of independence would not be
supported by his constituents, who would begin strikes,
demonstrations and appeals for Gorbachev to impose presidential
rule.
   On Saturday morning, a group of about 300 people gathered to
denounce the declaration. Interfront, a group of ethnic Russians
and other non-Latvians, organized the rally on Cathedral Square,
where speakers mounted an army truck to demand the withdrawal of
the declaration.
   Only 54 percent of Latvia's 2.7 million people are ethnic
Latvians. Most of the remainder are ethnic Russians, many of whom
oppose independence.
   Also Saturday, a group of Latvian economists announced plans to
introduce their own currency in the republic. Economists of the new
Latvia Fund said work was under way to restore the pre-Soviet
Latvian currency, the lat.
   The fund, created last month, plans to issue $11 million in
bonds and lottery tickets that can be sold abroad to finance the
creation and printing of the new currency, they said.
   Similar plans to issue currencies have been announced in Estonia
and Lithuania, but none has been issued yet.

<HEAD>Cuomo Commission Calls For Stricter Controls In Adirondacks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A state commission appointed to study the
future of the 6 million-acre Adirondack Park called Saturday for
strict new curbs on development in the largest such wilderness
tract in the Lower 48 states.
   Many of the 245 proposals by the Commission on the Adirondacks
in the 21st Century immediately drew fire from some of the park's
130,000 residents who hope increased development can bolster the
region's weak economy.
   Though the mountainous area in northern New York is called a
park, it actually is a patchwork of public land and private
property. Use of the private land is controlled to some extent by a
state law requiring parts of the region be kept ``forever wild.''
   The commission recommended the state buy an additional 650,000
acres of the park _ more than 1,000 square miles.
   About half the park's land is in private hands. The panel
proposed to reclassify 90 percent of that land for ``resource
use,'' where construction would be prohibited for at least a year,
said the commission.
   Another proposal to discourage development would require minimum
2,000-acre housing sites in some backwoods portions of the park.
Under current park rules, the largest minimum lot size is 47 acres
per dwelling.
   The commission was appointed by Gov. Mario Cuomo, and its
recommendations must be enacted by the state Legislature to take
effect. Its report should be viewed by park residents as a threat
to their way of life, said Adirondack Planning Commission Chairman
Hammond Robertson.
   ``They have just lost sight of the American way of life, the
right to own property, the right to use property,'' said Robertson,
who is also town supervisor of Queensbury, about 50 miles north of
Albany.
   ``There is a real threat from people outside the park who don't
really realize that this is our home. It's a community, it's not
just a park. It's not like Central Park in New York City,'' said
Robertson.
   The Cuomo commission insists that something must be done to
preserve the unique character of the wilderness area.
   ``From within, development threatens its forested mountains, its
shorelines and roadsides,'' said the report. ``From outside ...
larger threats loom from a booming population looking for
recreational property to buy, from changing economies in the timber
and tourism industries, and from acid rain and deposition of
airborne toxins.''
   The Cuomo commission is headed by Peter Berle, president of the
National Audubon Society and a former commissioner of New York
state's Department of Environmental Conservation.
   Creation of the commission stirred up 20-year old resentment in
the Adirondack Mountains, where the state already limits
development through a complex land-use plan devised during the Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller era.
   ``A moratorium would be a useless political maneuver designed
only to appease the most extreme factions of the environmental
community,'' said the Adirondack Fairness Coalition, a group of
residents who favor development.
   Environmental groups, most notably the Adirondack Council, are
urging stricter controls. Commission members and staff said that
some of the panel's 245 recommendations were aimed at improving
life for the Adirondack people.
   The report recommended creation of an Adirondack Park Community
Development Corporation to build housing and provide services in
areas set aside for development.
   The panel also called for a sliding tax on home sales starting
at 1 percent for $150,000 homes and rising to 7.5 percent for those
sold for more than $250,000. The revenue would go toward affordable
housing programs in the park.
   ``It appears just to be a bone that they threw in to try and
appease us,'' said Frederick Monroe, chairman of the Fairness
Commission and a lawyer in Chestertown. ``We're not sure there's
any meat on it.''

   The market for Soviet contemporary art, once
heated by glasnost and the new warmth in East-West relations, took
a chilly plunge Saturday when nearly half the paintings at a major
auction failed to draw bids.
   Two years ago, the Soviet Union's first international art
auction attracted celebrity buyers such as rock star Elton John and
pulled in a total of $3.6 million dollars, triple the pre-sale
estimate by Sotheby's.
   Saturday's auction in New York, billed as the first major
auction of Soviet contemporary art in the West, had roughly the
same number of paintings by many of the same artists. But its total
revenues barely topped $1.1 million.
   About 60 of the 119 works didn't sell at all.
   ``The people who bought, bought extremely well. They found some
good bargains,'' said Swiss auctioneer Geza von Hapsburg, chairman
of the Geneva-based auction house of Habsburg, Feldman.
   At Sotheby's Moscow auction in July, 1988, rapid-fire bidding
drove the price for ``Fundamental Lexicon,'' a painting by
45-year-old Grisha Bruskin, to $416,000 _ a record for a piece of
contemporary Soviet art.
   On Saturday, the gavel fell quickly on Bruskin's ``Old
Testament'' at $36,000, in the lower range of the pre-sale estimate
of $35,000 to $40,000 and far less than some experts had expected.
   Few of the 31 artists whose works were on sale attended the
auction. One who did, 52-year-old Vladimir Yankilevsky, left glumly
after none of his three pieces was sold.
   Von Hapsburg pronounced himself ``satisfied.'' He noted that 300
people packed the auction gallery in Manhattan's Puck Building,
there was strong media coverage, and a few paintings sold for
considerably more than predicted.
   But he conceded that the bidding, on the whole, was
disappointing after the spectacular success of the pathbreaking
Moscow auction.
   ``That was just hype _ the first one,'' he said. ``Today was _
you could say `sobering,' or you could say `realistic,' because
many of these artists are not well known to the American public,
even though they are the cream of what Soviet art produces today.''
   All but a handful of the paintings that went on the block
Saturday belonged to a single collection, amassed in buying trips
to the Soviet Union during the past five years by a French art book
publisher, Jose Alvarez.
   Von Hapsburg contended that the quality of the collection was,
on average, higher than the paintings that the Soviet government
allowed to go on sale in Moscow.
   While some experts might dispute that, there is general
agreement that the artists represented in Saturday's auction _
including Ilya Kabakov, Ivan Chuikov, Igor Kopystianski, Francisco
Infante and Natalia Nesterova _ are among the best in the Soviet
Union, according to Margarita Tupitsyn, a curatorial consultant in
Soviet contemporary art for the Guggenheim Museum in New York.
   The top price paid for a painting on Saturday was $140,000 for
``Path'' by Kabakov, 57, probably the best known contemporary
Soviet artist in the West. A spokeswoman for the auction house said
the buyer was a museum, but she declined to identify it without
permission.

   A baby boy whose kidnapping four
days ago had prompted an islandwide search by police and the FBI
was found alive and apparently unharmed Saturday, police said.
   The cries of 15-day-old Carlos Luis Canales were heard outside
an office building by two census takers, who alerted their
superiors.
   The infant had been abducted Tuesday by a woman who posed as a
sales representative for a diaper manufacturer.
   He was discovered inside a shopping bag beside a garbage bin on
the outskirts of Carolina, an eastern suburb east of San Juan,
police said.
   A local radio station reported that a medical checkup indicated
the baby was unharmed and in good physical condition.
   The kidnapper had told the baby's parents that their three
children had won a contest sponsored by the diaper company. She
took them to a local mall to photograph the children and, while the
parents were busy, left with the infant.
   The census takers heard the baby crying outside a building that
houses a U.S. Census office and other government offices.
   The parents, Migdalia Cortes and Luis Canales, rushed to the
scene with police.
   Paul R. Philip, special agent in charge of the FBI office in San
Juan, said the FBI had helped in the investigation although there
appeared to be no federal jurisdiction in the case.

   Thousands of John Lennon fans, some
too young to remember the Beatles, swayed and sang along with songs
including his anthem ``Imagine'' at a hometown tribute.
   ``It's a great day, isn't it?'' Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, asked
the crowd. ``I think John would be happy, too.''
   At the close of the concert, she and son Sean, 14, wept and
hugged some of the musicians, who included B.B. King, Joe Cocker,
Roberta Flack, the Moody Blues, Hall and Oates, Wet Wet Wet and
Randy Travis.
   However, the turnout was only 15,000, according to police
estimates. Organizers had hoped for about 45,000. Tickets were $41
for the charity benefit concert, which featured a program of
Beatles and Lennon songs.
   The concert was televised in Britain and was to be rebroadcast
worldwide in October in a 50th birthday tribute to Lennon a decade
after his death.
   Cyndi Lauper, in a white minidress, sang ``Hey Bulldog,'' and
Dave Edmunds, backed by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra,
did the Beatles classic, ``A Day in the Life.''
   Soul singer Al Green was the opening act. His version of ``All
You Need is Love,'' turned into a singalong with the crowd, and
Kylie Minogue did ``Help.''
   American actor Christopher Reeve was among the hosts of the
concert.
   Ex-Beatles George Harrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr did
not attend, but McCartney and Starr made taped contributions.
   On tape, Starr performed ``I Call Your Name'' and said, ``John
had the biggest heart of any man I have ever met to this day. He
was a giving, loving, caring human being. He was crazy as well some
days _ but the guy would give you his heart.''
   Lennon's co-songwriter, Paul McCartney, said on his tape:
``Hello Liverpool, scene of many great memories, John, me and the
rest of the lads.'' The Beatles were raised in Liverpool and got
their start in the Merseyside bars.
   All the musicians assembled on stage for ``Give Peace a
Chance,'' as the enthusiastic audience sang along, waved and
clapped.
   The concert closed with a recording of Lennon singing
``Imagine,'' while giant screens showed a video featuring John and
Yoko.
   Proceeds are to go to the Spirit Foundation, the charity founded
by the Lennons in 1978, two years before Lennon was shot to death
in front of his apartment in New York City.
   Lennon was slain on Dec. 8, 1980, when he was 40. The confessed
killer, Mark Chapman, is serving a life prison sentence.

<TEXT>
   Turkish Cypriots vote Sunday in
parliamentary elections that could bring defeat for the governing
party and new momentum to stalled peace talks aimed at uniting the
island's Turkish and Greek sectors.
   Analysts said voters in the breakaway Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus could unseat President Rauf Denktash's National
Unity Party Sunday for the first time in 15 years. The region,
created following Turkey's 1974 invasion of Cyprus, is only
recognized by Turkey.
   Two weeks ago Denktash won his fourth term as president by
capturing 67 percent of the vote, but his party appears much less
popular.
   Analysts said if the National Struggle Party, an opposition
coalition, wins power, it would leave Denktash virtually powerless
because most decisions are made by the legislature and the
president has little executive power.
   The opposition has accused Denktash of intransigence in
reunification talks on Cyprus.
   While opposition leaders said they would welcome peace talks,
they have also indicated they would not retreat from the
traditional Turkish demand for a loose federation with both zones.
   Turkey will also remain a factor in future negotiations. Ankara
maintains an estimated 30,000 troops in the north and has given
substantial funding to the republic.
   The opposition coalition comprises the conservative New Birth
Party, mainly supported by settlers from Turkey, the leftist
Socialist Liberation and the Republican Turkish Party.
   In the last elections in 1985 the parties received a combined
vote of 61 percent, but their divided votes gave them a minority of
seats in the 50-member Parliament.
   The opposition has accused the governing party of widespread
corruption and the misuse of economic resources.

   Twenty-two years after their capture by North
Korea and two years after being snubbed by their own government,
the crew of the USS Pueblo received prisoner of war medals Saturday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Sixty-four of the 82 crewmen seized with the intelligence ship</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   gathered by San Diego Bay to be recognized as prisoners of war for
enduring 11 months in captivity in North Korea in 1968.
   The sailors, a few of whom are still on active duty with the
Navy, received the awards in a ceremony conducted by Assistant
Secretary of the Navy Barbara Pope. She read a statement from
President Bush commending the crew for its ``unfailing resolve.''
   It was a day of celebration for the former shipmates, but for
former Pueblo Cmdr. Lloyd ``Pete'' Bucher, who had worked to see
the men honored for their courage under captivity, it also was a
day of redemption for the ship.
   ```This is what needed to be done when we got home, '' Bucher
said after the 40-minute ceremony. ``They needed to tell these guys
that they had served well.
   ``What they got was a very military function called a board of
inquiry and then, `Bye-bye.' They did receive some awards later on
but it was done more or less in private. I wanted these guys
recognized in public.''
   When the POW medal was authorized by Congress in 1988, the crew
of the Pueblo was excluded from eligibility. The Pentagon had ruled
that the crew was merely detained, rather than according the
sailors POW status.
   ``It's a day of great for me personally,'' Bucher said. ``I have
never been happier than I am today.''
   The Pueblo was captured Jan. 23, 1968, in international waters
after being fired on by North Korean vessels. The crew was
tortured, endured public humiliation and resisted efforts by the
North Koreans to be used for propaganda purposes before being
released in December 1968.
   Even after a formal Navy court of inquiry, many questions remain
about the Koreans' reason for seizing the ship and about the
failure of U.S. forces to respond to calls for help before Bucher
surrendered the ship and crew.
   Bucher and other Pueblo officers were recommended for courts
martial at the time of the inquiry. But the Navy never tried them.
   During a ceremony attended by about 500 people, including the
families of some of the crew members, the sailors heard praise that
had eluded them for more than two decades.
   ``These men once were snubbed by our government when the medals
were first awarded, '' said Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, who Bucher
credited for eventually getting the medals approved in Congress.
``That was an oversight. Today, in a small way, we are trying to
right that wrong.''
   F.C. ``Skip'' Schumacher Jr. acknowledged the honor on behalf of
the crew.
   ``The POW medal is to honor those people who served and served
honorably, and I'm here to tell you today that this crew did serve
honorably,'' Schumacher said, drawing applause.
   Bucher has in the past accused the Navy of putting the ship in
dangerous position without adequate support.
   Bucher declined to speak at the ceremony, and said later it was
because he'd been too emotional.
   In a sense, the medals close the books on the Pueblo affair,
Bucher said: ``Now we move on to just reunions and watching one
another's kids and grandkids grow up.''

   Sac and Fox Indians received an apology
Saturday from Wisconsin for the 1832 Bad Axe Massacre during which
hundreds of their tribal predecessors were killed while trying to
flee white pursuers.
   ``I thank you, sir,'' Elmer Manatowa of Stroud, Okla., chief of
the Sac-Fox nation told a state legislator who presented a
proclamation of apology from the Wisconsin Assembly during a
ceremony.
   ``The Sac and Fox nation in Oklahoma is thriving. One hundred
years ago, one might have thought the Sac and Fox might not be in
existence today,'' Manatowa said.
   Gunfire on the banks of the Mississippi River 158 years ago
ended a trek of hundreds of miles by men, women and children led by
chief Black Hawk after white settlers evicted the tribes from their
ancestral lands near Rock Island, Ill.
   Known to history as the Black Hawk War, the relentless pursuit
of the fleeing Indians and the riverside massacre was described by
one historian as ``one of the bloodiest tragedies in the sad
history of American-Indian relations.'' The Indians were attacked
by Army soldiers, state militia and settlers.
   The ceremony at the battle site about 20 miles downstream from
La Crosse was attended by about 200 people.
   Wisconsin Chippewa, currently debating the state over treaty
rights to off-reservation natural resources, have participated in
memorial ceremonies at the site in previous years.
   Attorney Truman Carter of Stroud, the Sac-Fox treasurer, said
20th century disputes among Indians and non-Indians must be
resolved in the courts, not in the field.
   The Assembly proclamation was presented by state Rep. David
Clarenbach. The resolution was adopted last year at the urging of
Milwaukee-based Honor Our Neighbors Origins and Rights.
   ``What we do is not without example elsewhere,'' Clarenbach
said. ``The state of Minnesota apologized to the Sioux for mass
executions carried out without due process'' after an Indian
uprising in the 1860s.
   ``Congress has acknowledged the impropriety of internment of
Japanese-Americans and the new regimes of Eastern Europe draw great
moral strength from the admission of past wrongs,'' he said.
   Tribal leaders from the Sac and Fox nation in Iowa, Oklahoma and
Kansas were invited to the ceremony.
   Since 1955, a roadside placard has told visitors about the
battle during which Black Hawk's people, trying to escape across
the Mississippi, were hounded into riverside marshes where they
were shot or drowned.
   ``To have the state of Wisconsin publicly apologize is something
we look at,'' Manatowa said last week. ``I am going to ask the
state of Wisconsin to do the same thing for the Chippewa, to do
something to ease the relationship up there.''
   More than 1,000 Sac and Fox had gathered at the river after
eluding militia at the Battle of Wisconsin Heights near Madison, a
maneuver some historians say classified Black Hawk as a military
genius.
   The army, aided by an armed steamboat on the river, launched a
campaign to stop them. Black Hawk tried to surrender at Bad Axe but
troops disregarded the plea, witnesses said. Estimates of Indian
deaths range from 850 to 1,400.
   ``What a terrible day it was in 1832. What a great day this
is,'' Hilary Waukau Sr., a Menominee tribal legislator, said during
the ceremony.
   The massacre ``was one of the bloodiest tragedies in the sad
history of American-Indian relations,'' historian Ray Allen
Billington wrote in a book called ``Westward Expansion: A History
of the American Frontier.''
   The site in southwestern Wisconsin contains many reminders
besides Victory, a nearby hamlet named by whites after the battle.
There's also Black Hawk Campground, Black Hawk Marina, Battle
Island, Battle Bluff, a town called Retreat, and another called
Soldier's Grove.

   The accord, which is expected to save Costa Rica $150 million a
year, was signed by James Jardine of the Bank of America, and
Eduardo Lizano of the Costa Rican Central Bank. Jardine acted as
the representative of the creditor banks.
   President Oscar Arias hailed the agreement as an historic event
that removes one of the main obstacles to his country's economic
growth.
   Eduardo Lizano, president of the Central Bank, said earlier that
under the agreement, Costa Rica will repurchase 64 percent of its
commercial debt at 16 cents on the dollar.
   Costa Rica now will have until May 21 to pay $253 million to
bring itself up to date in payments and repurchase the old debt.
   Costa Rica was one of the earliest countries to reach agreement
in principle on new financing packages under a U.S. plan unveiled
in March 1989 by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   It focuses on enticing commercial banks to write off some of
their loans to Third World nations or reduce the interest charged
in return for guarantees that the remaining debt will be paid.

<HEAD>Police Make Huge Cocaine Haul in Series of Lab Raids</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army troops backed by fighter bombers
and helicopter gunships raided crude jungle laboratories and seized
16,400 pounds of cocaine, an army general said Saturday.
   It was the largest haul of cocaine in Colombia since March 10,
1984, when agents seized 22,000 pounds in what was believed to be
the biggest seizure of the drug to date.
   Two men were killed and 14 were arrested in the raids, Gen.
Humberto Castaneda said in a broadcast interview with the RCN radio
chain.
   The raids began Thursday, and by Saturday morning the army had
landed troops at 20 clandestine runways where five airplanes were
seized, the general said in the RCN interview.
   One of the planes seized was from Bolivia, Castaneda said.
Cocaine paste is brought from Bolivia and Peru to Colombia, where
it is converted into pure cocaine through chemical processing.
   The raids were in the state of Meta, in an area about 200 miles
southeast of the capital of Bogota.
   Castaneda did not disclose how many laboratories were found. It
is common for traffickers to build a cluster of labs in the same
area to make it more difficult to spot the operation from the air.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco launched an offensive
against drug traffickers after they were blamed for killing a
presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, on Aug. 18.
   Since then, the government security forces have found dozens of
laboratories, seized tons of cocaine and confiscated millions of
dollars worth of property.
   The army and police have seized mansions, ranches, yachts,
airplanes and luxury cars believed to belong to traffickers.
   So far all but one of the chieftains of the Medellin cartel have
eluded the police raids. Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the reputed No. 2
figure in the cartel, was shot during a battle with police Dec. 15
on Colombia's north coast.

<HEAD>British Jurist Named to Head Inquiry Into Illegal Arms Shipment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS SEON</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British jurist will lead an
investigation into a shipment of Israeli-made arms ordered by a
Cabinet official that ended up in the hands of Colombian drug
dealers, the government said.
   Louis Blomcooper was chosen by the Cabinet at a special meeting
on Friday because of his experience in conducting commissions of
inquiry and will arrive in the Caribbean republic to start this
week, a government statement said Friday.
   The arms scandal broke in February when Colombian authorities
discovered a cache of Israeli-made arms in a ranch owned by reputed
drug lord Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, who was killed in a gun battle
with police in December.
   The Colombian authorities said they found 232 weapons, including
rifles, shoulder-fired rockets and infrared nightscopes.
   A preliminary investigation by a special committee set up here
determined that the arms shipment passed through Antigua, a tiny
island 250 miles southeast of Puerto Rico, on April 24, 1989, and
arrived in Colombia five days later.
   The scandal has plunged the Antiguan government into one of its
worst crises since Prime Minister Vere Bird Sr., 81, came to power
in 1956.
   Minister of Public Works Vere Bird Jr., national security
adviser to his father, was named by the Israeli government as the
Antiguan official who ordered the arms shipment in November 1988
for the Antiguan Defense Forces.
   It is unclear how the weapons were then shipped to Colombia.
   Bird Jr., 54, has denied any wrongdoing and stepped down from
his post until the matter is resolved.
   The twin-island state of Antigua and Barbuda has a population of
80,000 and gained independence from Britain in 1981.

<HEAD>Report: Romania and Warsaw Pact Nations Sold Soviet Weapons to
United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States secretly bought advanced
Soviet military technology from Romania for 10 years before deposed
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was executed, according to a published
report.
   The Washington Post, quoting ``intelligence sources here and
abroad,'' said the program coordinated by the Central Intelligence
Agency resulted in more than $40 million being paid to Romania
through foreign middlemen, with about 20 percent of that ending up
in Swiss bank accounts controlled by the Ceausescu family.
   The paper said the Ceausescu connection was part of a larger
weapons-buying operation that reached into the East Bloc military
and allowed the U.S. military to obtain important components of air
defense systems that the Soviet Union has in place to protect
itself and Warsaw Pact countries.
   The paper said the latest version of the Shilka, one of the most
effective antiaircraft systems in the Soviet inventory, was among
the items purchased from Romania, which also sold mobile rocket
launchers and radar systems.
   ``The potential value of these things is almost incalculable,''
the Post quoted an unidentified U.S. intelligence officer as
saying. ``The only way you can truly unlock the secrets of your
adversaries' weapons is to physically have them.''
   For example, access to Soviet radar systems aided in development
of the ``stealth'' technology that is designed to allow U.S.
military planes to avoid radar detection, the paper said.
   It quoted U.S. government officials as saying that Nicolae
Causescu was not personally involved in the dozen or so
transactions, but that the operation could have succeeded only with
his tacit approval.
   The Romanian operation came to a halt with Causescu's overthrow
last December, the paper said.
   Moreover, it said the pro-democracy upheaval in Eastern Europe
has disrupted the broader operation, but not stopped it.
   Over the past decade, the United States has paid more than $250
million to obtain the latest versions of Soviet-made weapons
systems through contacts in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East
Germany and Bulgaria, the Post quoted its sources as saying.
   The willingness of influential military or Communist Party
officials to sell secrets to the United States was viewed by some
U.S. intelligence officials as a reflection of growing discontent
among some Warsaw Pact officials.
   ``It was corrupt to the core,'' the paper quoted a former U.S.
official as saying. ``There was no ideological discrimination. If
you wanted to use this as an indication of the fragility of the
system, this was a classic.''
   As to the Romanian connection, the Post quoted a retired
high-ranking U.S. intelligence official as saying ``it was just
greed -- pure and simple personal greed. It was an indication of
the corruption of the Ceausescus, and from the U.S. standpoint, we
didn't really care who we dealt with if they could produce.
Generally, you don't run into sainted characters in this business.''

<HEAD>Government Orders Enhanced Cargo Door Monitoring on Older Boeings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered
airlines to install an enhanced cockpit warning system to ensure
cargo doors are properly shut on certain older Boeing 747s, in
response to a deadly accident last year.
   The order is the latest in a series of FAA directives prompted
by the Feb. 24, 1989, accident in which nine people were swept to
their deaths after a United Airlines 747 cargo door ripped open in
flight near Hawaii.
   The FAA estimates it will cost U.S. airlines about $774,000 to
make the changes on the 140 airplanes affected by the order.
   Under the directive, which takes effect May 29, cockpit warning
devices must be repositioned so they can be seen by both the pilot
and the copilot. The devices must also be made to monitor more
parts of the doors' locking mechanisms.
   Warning lights are to be hooked directly to the part of the lock
believed to have been damaged in the United accident. Currently,
the lights are hooked to pressure relief windows on the cargo doors.
   The United accident is believed to have been caused by locks
that had been damaged unnoticeably by improper handling. The FAA
has already required U.S. airlines to reinforce the locks.
   ``We felt the way it was set up was adequate,'' Boeing Co.
spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese said Friday. ``But we have worked with
the FAA to make this change. We want to make sure this never
happens again.''
   The agency has no jurisdiction over 640 older 747s used by
foreign air carriers, but they often follow the FAA's lead.

   Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke
on Saturday married a woman said to be the best friend of his
former wife, Suzanne Martin Cooke, in his fourth trip down the
aisle.
   Cooke, 77, confirmed that he and Marlen Ramallo Chalmers were
wed at his Virginia estate over the weekend. The announcement was
made at the running of the Virginia Gold Cup Steeplechase in The
Plains, Va,. where Cooke's horse, Lithograph, was scratched from
the race.
   Cooke wore a beige and yellow houndstooth check jacket while his
bride was attired in an off-the-shoulder, white cotton tea-length
dress, with a straw hat pulled low over her face.
   Asked whether they planned a honeymoon, Chalmers said, ``Oh
yes,'' before Cooke hurriedly steered her away.
   Chalmers, who is in her mid 30s, and Suzanne Cooke, the
billionaire's third wife, were old family friends who used to
vacation together, according to the couple's companions at the
racetrack.
   Cooke's last marriage ended in a highly publicized divorce when
he discovered that Suzanne Cooke had became pregnant and failed to
get an abortion as she had allegedly promised.
   Cooke did not acknowlege paternity of their daughter,
Jacqueline, who was born Jan. 25, 1988, until after a court-ordered
blood test.

   British soccer fans clashed with police and one
another in several cities on the closing day of soccer season,
leaving dozens injured and more than 80 people arrested,
authorities said Saturday.
   British soccer has long been plagued by fan violence and crowd
control problems. Last year, a crowd crush at Hillsborough Stadium
in Sheffield left 95 dead.
   The worst violence was in the south coast resort town of
Bournemouth, where hometown fans clashed Friday night and Saturday
with police and visiting fans from Leeds.
   At least 50 people were arrested and charged with assault,
criminal damage or public order offenses, police said early Sunday.
At least 20 people, including six police officers, were hurt,
police said.
   In the hours before Saturday's game, 2,000 fans _ many without
tickets or with forged tickets _ began showering police with rocks,
bricks and bottles and threatening Bournemouth players. Police
brought in reinforcements from as far away as London, 95 miles away.
   The trouble began the night before the match, when about 100
soccer fans set fire to Bournemouth's famous pier and smashed
windows at a posh shopping arcade. About 300 others attacked
workers and customers at a seaside pub and tore apart furniture,
authorities said.
   ``I have been in Bournemouth for 33 years and I have never seen
scenes like that before, and that includes the mods and rockers in
the '60s,'' said assistant chief police constable Alan Rose.
   At Chesterfield, just south of Sheffield, 12 people were taken
to the hospital and others were treated at the stadium after
clashes between rival fans and police. None of the injuries was
said to be serious, but there were 30 arrests.
   Trouble was also reported in Shrewsbury, in central England,
where visiting fans from Preston battled with hometown supporters.
A match in Birmingham had to be halted twice by the referee when
fans ran onto the field, and several people were arrested, but
police said no exact figure was available.

<HEAD>Drive Launched in Oman to Save Rare Mountain Goat From Extinction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEREDITH CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MUSCAT, Oman (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservation officials on Saturday announced
a renewed drive to save from extinction one of the world's rarest
mammals, the Arabian Tahr mountain goat.
   The campaign will combine a new captive breeding program and
continued efforts to protect the animals in the wild, said Ralph
Daly, conservation adviser to Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos.
   The remaining Arabian Tahr are found in the sultanate's northern
Hajar mountain range and in mountains in the neighboring United
Arab Emirates. There are believed to be between 1,000 and 2,000 of
the goats left.
   The government established the Wadi Sarin Nature Reserve to
protect the goats after hunting them was banned in 1975. Mountain
tribesmen known as mushrafyn, or guardians, monitor the movements
of the goats in their remote reserve on 6,500-foot Jebel Aswad, or
Black Mountain.
   Daly said a breeding program for scientific study of around 14
Tahr is already under way at a captive breeding center. It will be
supplemented by a second breeding program ``to ensure we have
animals of different lines,'' he said.
   ``We believe it is vital to broaden the genetic base of the only
Tahr population left in the world,'' said Daly.
   The goats are related to the chamois and musk ox, and their
preferred habitat is steep, north-facing mountains. The Hajar range
runs in a crescent from the Strait of Hormuz in the north to the
edge of the Wahiba Sands in the southeast.
   The majority of the research work carried out for the government
has been led by Muscat-based British wildlife biologist Dr. Paul
Munton. He described the Arabian Tahr as ``not a well-adapted
desert dweller but a relic of a more temperature fauna.''
   The species, he said, is ``hanging on to life in the coolest and
most sheltered parts of the most difficult mountains of Arabia.''
   The goats eat fruit, seeds and grasses. They are hunted in the
wild by leopards, hyenas and wolves, and their young are prey to
eagles, ravens and red foxes.

<TEXT>
   Two soldiers have been charged with
murdering a woman outside a bar during the U.S. invasion of Panama
and a third soldier has pleaded guilty to lesser charges in the
case, the Army revealed.
   The case, made public Thursday, is the second prosecution of
U.S. soldiers for their conduct during the invasion. A paratrooper
based at Fort Bragg, N.C., was charged with murder for shooting a
Panamanian who surrendered to U.S. forces during the December
invasion that toppled Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   The charges against the Fort Ord soldiers involve the shooting
death of a 50-year-old Panamanian woman at a bar. They were charged
in late January, and were tentatively scheduled for military trial
in late June, said Maj. L.D. Walker, a Fort Ord spokesman.
   The men to be tried are Sgt. Paul R. Finsel Jr., 25, of Arkoma,
Okla., and Pfc. Mark F. McMonagle, 20, of Philadelphia, Pa. The men
were members of the 7th Light Infantry Division stationed at Fort
Ord.
   In addition to murder, charges against Finsel and McMonagle
include conspiring to obstruct justice and willfully disobeying
orders against consuming alcohol or having sexual contact with
Panamanian women.
   A third soldier, Pfc. Marc Gussen, 19, of Teaneck, N.J., pleaded
guilty in April to firearms, alcohol and obstruction of justice
charges in the case, Walker said. He was sentenced to two years'
confinement, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, reduction to
private and a dishonorable discharge.
   John L. Williams, attorney for McMonagle, disputed the murder
charge.
   ``Whatever it is, it is not murder,'' Williams told The New York
Times. ``There is no evidence of premeditation at all. Nor is there
good evidence that he is the person who fired the shot.''
   The men were charged in the death of Leila Diaz De Panay on Jan.
25 in the Rio Abajo section of Panama City, according to Walker,
who refused to reveal details.
   According to Williams and McMonagle's relatives, the trouble
began when Finsel lost his pistol at a bar that also served as a
brothel. To cover the loss, he suggested the men stage a firefight
outside, the Times reported Sunday.
   As they fired into the air, other soldiers came out of a nearby
barracks to investigate. They were then ordered to pull back, with
McMonagle covering the rear, Williams said. When Ms. Panay was
killed in an alley, McMonagle was nearby, he said.
   Under military law the maximum penalty for murder is death, but
the sentence can be invoked only in a case of premeditated murder,
said Walker. Penalties short of death are left to the discretion of
the officer conducting the court martial, he said.
   In the earlier case, 1st Sgt. Roberto Enrique Bryan, 42, a
member of the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg, faces a
charge of premeditated murder.
   He is accused of shooting a Panamanian man who surrendered after
a grenade attack that injured two U.S. soldiers at Madden Dam
outside Panama City on Dec. 23.

   Elton H. Rule, the former ABC chief
who was credited with the network's rise to broadcasting dominance
in the 1970s, died of cancer Saturday at his home. He was 73.
   Rule, named president of ABC in 1968 and chief operating officer
in 1972, introduced such innovations as the made-for-television
movie and ABC Monday Night Football.
   He also signed producer Aaron Spelling to an exclusive contract
to produce programs for ABC. Spelling produced such hit series as
the ``The Mod Squad,'' ``Starsky and Hutch,'' ``The Love Boat'' and
``Charlie's Angels.''
   ``Elton was universally admired by all who knew him,'' said
Thomas S. Murphy, chairman and chief executive officer of Capital
Cities-ABC Inc. ``He led ABC from a third-place network to equality
with CBS and NBC. We are all saddened by his passing.''
   During his ABC reign, the network added 68 affiliated stations,
while ABC Radio Network grew by 1,435 affiliated stations.
   Corporate revenues grew from below $600 million in 1968 to more
than $2.7 billion in 1983. Earnings grew from $13.5 million to $160
million during the same time period.
   He left active management in 1984 and continued to serve on the
board.
   Rule is survived by his wife of 47 years, Betty Louise Bender;
three children, a grandson and a granddaughter.
   There will be no funeral and the body will be cremated,
according to Rule's wishes, ABC officials said.

   Two art dealers were convicted in a multimillion
swindle involving reproductions of works by Salvador Dali and
actors Anthony Quinn, Red Skelton and Tony Curtis.
   A federal jury on Friday convicted William Mett, who owns Center
Art Galleries-Hawaii in the Waikiki tourist district, and Marvin
Wiseman, director of the gallery, of mail and wire fraud.
   Mett was convicted of 73 counts and Wiseman of 63 counts. The
gallery was convicted of 72 counts.
   Federal prosecutors said the gallery made huge profits between
1977 and 1989 by buying cheap reproductions of Dali paintings and
works by the celebrities and telling buyers the artists were
personally involved in the reproduction process.
   ``My any measure, this was a massive fraud directed at our
visitor industry,'' said U.S. Attorney Dan Bent.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne estimated that customers of
the gallery who bought Dali reproductions were defrauded of $113
million from 1977 to 1989.
   Mett, 47, and Wiseman, 46, said in a joint written statement
they will appeal.
   The gallery bought reproductions of Dali paintings for less than
$135 each and sold them for $1,000 to $21,500 apiece, prosecutors
said.
   Each count on which the two were convicted carries a maximum
penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Similar fines
could be imposed on the company.
   Sentencing in U.S. District Court was scheduled for Aug. 20.

<HEAD>U.S. Envoy Irks Kenya's President With Calls for Political Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador to Kenya has run afoul
of President Daniel arap Moi as the Kenyan leader continues to
resist calls for a multiparty political system.
   The ambassador, Smith Hempstone, has publicly suggested that
abolishing one-party rule would bring greater democracy and also
result in a better investment climate.
   Moi, who has served unchallenged for 10 years, characterizes
those advocating political change in this East African nation as
``tribalists and traitors.''
   On Friday, Moi repeated his view that Kenya was not politically
mature enough for a multiparty system. While not mentioning
Hempstone by name, he hinted at the possiblity of steps against
foreign diplomats considered to be interfering in Kenya's affairs.
   In a fundraising speech, the president noted embassy personnel
are allowed to travel freely throughout Kenya and said pointedly he
``would not like to'' restrict those movements.
   Moi did not specifically mention Hempstone, but his party issued
a statement naming the U.S. envoy and declaring: ``We assert, as we
have always done, that national interest must never be dictated by
external forces.''
   It added: ``Kenya is a sovereign state, a fact that is not
negotiable and which cannot be compromised at any cost.''
   Moi's ruling Kenya African National Union has dominated politics
since independence from Great Britain in 1963.
   Hempstone, a former editor and columnist for the conservative
Washington Times, has been highly visible and outspoken since his
arrival in Kenya late last year.
   The latest political debate was ignited three weeks ago when an
Anglican bishop, Henry Okullu, called for an end to the one-party
system and a limit of two four-year terms for presidents.
   Since then, other critics have taken up the call, with their
demands for change extensively reported by Nairobi's three
English-language newspapers.
   Such public debate is relatively rare in Kenya, where the
government has been known to detain its critics.
   It comes at a time when a number of other African nations, most
of them former French colonies in West Africa, have begun to move
toward multiparty systems.
   Moi's party was enshrined as Kenya's only legal party under a
1982 constitutional amendment. On Thursday, two former Cabinet
members called for repeal of that amendment, along with the
dissolution of Parliament and free elections.
   One of the two, Kenneth Matiba, a former minister for transport
and communications, had been picked up by security police in March
and held for questioning. No charges were ever filed.

   A man who won $10 million in a magazine
contest last year notched another victory Saturday: He was elected
mayor of this city of 50,000 residents.
   Bob Castleberry, 60, said he had thought about running for the
non-paying job for years, but couldn't afford to until he won the
Publishers Clearinghouse Sweepstakes a year ago.
   He quit his job as a salesman for a business forms company in
January to follow in the political footsteps of his father, who
served on the Denton City Council.
   ``I grew up watching my father giving everything to the
community,'' Castleberry said. ``Now I just want to do what I can.''
   Castleberry beat two-term incumbent Ray Stephens, winning 50
percent of the vote to Stephens' 45 percent.
   Appearing in advertisements about the sweepstakes helped in the
campaign by boosting his visibility in the community 35 miles

   Rival fishing crews fired automatic weapons
and rammed each other's boats Saturday in the Gulf of Mexico amid
tension between longtime area fishermen and Vietnamese newcomers.
   No injuries were reported, said Petty Officer Matt McGovern in
New Orleans. The shooting stopped when Coast Guard helicopters and
boats arrived, McGovern said.
   ``Some Vietnamese and Americans were shrimping together out
there. They got a little too crowded, tempers flared and somebody
started shooting,'' said Donald Lirette of Dulac, president of the
Terrebonne Fishermen's Organization.
   Five Vietnamese shrimpers were taken into custody and some
number of automatic weapons were confiscated, said Petty Officer
John Litzenberger said.
   Witnesses told the Coast Guard one shrimp boat got its anchor
caught in another's trawling nets. ``That's when the firefight
started,'' Litzenberger said.
   Witnesses accused the Vietnamese shrimpers fired on a boat
crewed by some longtime Louisiana fishermen, who then shot back,
Litzenberger said.
   The Coast Guard picked up three Vietnamese shrimpers after they
jumped into a passing boat and were taken to a nearby oil platform,
Litzenberger said. Two other crewmen were later taken into custody,
he said.
   Of 10 boats in the area, only two or three were involved in the
shooting, Litzenberger said.
   Authorities had reported one boat sinking because of the
ramming, but Litzenberger said it was out of danger.
   There has been animosity in Louisiana because of the arrival of
Vietnamese shrimp fishing crews, but there has been little
violence, Lirette said.
   ``It's a dog-eat-dog situation when things are like they are
now. Everybody's starving,'' Lirette said. ``The American shrimpers
can communicate with each other, but they can't communicate with
the Vietnamese.''
   Three Coast Guard boats, a U.S. Customs Service vessel and a
helicopter were sent to the scene, about 5 miles offshore.
   Litzenberger said authorities would keep watch on the shrimp
boats overnight and board the vessels at daylight Sunday. Until
then, the fishermen would have to remain aboard their vessels, he
said.
   ``We just have to determine what happened in the first place,''
Litzenberger said.

   More than 8,000 anti-Communist
demonstrators thronged downtown University Square for the 13th
straight day Friday, demanding the resignation of interim President
Ion Iliescu.
   The round-the-clock protest began April 22 and continued without
letup. Protesters say Iliescu and his National Salvation Front,
favored to win May 20 elections, have not completely shed Communist
beliefs and lean toward authoritarian government.
   Although the rally has blocked traffic downtown, it gave little
sign of being a sharp political confrontation. Demonstrators
holding flags and candles were seen debating and huddled around
bonfires.
   Protesters chanted, ``Down with Communism!'' and other slogans
expressing opposition to National Salvation Front leadership.

<TEXT>
   Sudanese strongman Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir on Friday pardoned a trade union leader condemned to
death for leading a general strike.
   He also canceled a prison sentence given another union member
and decided to release both men immediately, Egypt's state-owned
Middle East News Agency said in a report from Sudan's capital
Khartoum.
   The agency gave no further details but the move was apparently
taken in response to appeals at home and abroad.
   Five days ago, el-Bashir promised a delegation of prominent
Sudanese doctors that he would soon respond favorably to their
pleas and release the two.
   The United States and Egypt were among other countries that
appealed for the clemency.
   The pardon followed the execution of 28 army officers and the
jailing of 14 others for involvment in an alleged attempt to
overthrow the el-Bashir regime April 23.
   The officers were executed by firing squads after a secret
summary court-martial.
   A militry court sentenced Dr. Mamoun Mohamed Hussein, leader of
the disbanded Sudanese Doctors Union, to death by hanging in
November for leading a general strike a month earlier to protest
the detention of colleagues in military jails and the dismissal of
doctors from government posts.
   Dr. Sayed Mohamed Abdallah was sentenced to 15 years in jail by
the same court for taking part in the strike.
   The court said it based its decision on an emergency law
el-Bashir imposed after he seized power June 30 in a military coup.
Strikes are banned under the law.
   The emergency law, among other things, dissolved trade unions,
political parties and parliament.

   President Bush says that even as he
slashes new missile systems and negotiates with the Soviets to
reduce others, nuclear weapons are still needed in Europe.
   ``Only the combination of conventional forces and nuclear forces
have insured peace in Europe,'' he said Friday in the first of a
series of commencement speeches he will make on the changing
geopolitical face of the world.
   Bush said that in addition to scrapping upgraded Lance missiles
in Europe, he wants to begin talks with the Soviets to reduce other
short-range missiles shortly after signing a treaty on reducing
conventional forces next fall.
   Nonetheless, he said, ``The United States is not going to allow
Europe to become `safe for conventional war.'''

   Latvia's lawmakers defied Moscow by
declaring independence, but they called for a more gradual break
than in neighboring Lithuania and emphasized their desire to
negotiate with the Kremlin.
   ``Everything is ahead,'' Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov said
after the vote Friday. ``This is only the very, very beginning.''
   Gorbunov said at an evening news conference that the Latvian
government had received a proposal from Estonian President Arnold
Ruutel to start immediate coordinated actions on the two republics'
drives for independence.
   The 138-0 parliamentary vote, 50 years after Moscow seized the
three Baltic states on the Soviet's western border, put Latvia on a
similar secessionist path with Lithuania and Estonia.

   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene
says a strong declaration of support by Western nations could be
decisive in bringing the Baltic republics independence from the
Soviet Union.
   Mrs. Prunskiene's two-day, non-stop crusade for Lithuanian
independence at the White House, State Department and on Capitol
Hill resulted in an inconclusive session with President Bush.
   But she said Friday that she continues to hope that Bush and
other world leaders can yet be persuaded that embracing
independence for Lithuania and its neighbors Latvia and Estonia
will not undermine Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his
program of political and economic reform.
   She said the reluctance of Western nations to recognize an
independent Lithuania now is ``the main factor'' in the Soviets'
refusal to accept her republic's secession as an accomplished fact.

   Greyhound's third-quarter loss of nearly $56
million may make the bus line more anxious to settle the
2-month-old strike by its drivers, the union hopes.
   Bargaining talks, stalled since mid-March when the company
walked out over strike violence, were to resume today at the
National Mediation and Conciliation Service.
   ``We certainly hope, with this financial situation, they come
back to the table ready to negotiate,'' said Nick Nichols, a
spokesman for the 6,300 bus drivers and 3,000 other workers who
have been on strike since March 2.
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said the company would have
no new proposal on wages to present today. The company has said it
is offering $63 million over three years, although the Amalgamated
Council of Greyhound Local Unions contends the bus line is
inflating the figure.

   The seized assets of Manuel Noriega include some of
$11 million he got from U.S. intelligence agencies, his lawyers
argued, while asking that the government be forced to release the
money so they can be paid.
   A federal judge Friday ordered the government to justify its
seizure of the deposed Panamanian leader's $20 million in assets,
which defense attorneys claim were earned legitimately.
   Noriega's lawyers argued during an hourlong hearing that they
cannot proceed without money from bank accounts frozen by the
government. They subpoenaed records from the CIA, Drug Enforcement
Administration and other agencies as a way to prove Noriega's
income was not from drug trafficking.
   Frank Rubino, Noriega's lead attorney, told U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler that U.S. intelligence agencies had paid Noriega
$11 million during his years in the Panamanian National Guard.

<HEAD>Oily Tea Leaves: Interpreting OPEC's Behavior Is Always a Guessing
Game</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When OPEC ministers proclaimed a 1.5 million
barrel-a-day production cut to help stabilize oil prices, the
international petroleum market gave them a demonstration of their
credibility. Prices fell.
   The reaction to the accord reached this past week was in many
ways predictable. Key members of the 13-nation cartel frequently
have cheated undercut each other after past agreements, and some
oil intelligence analysts said there wasn't much reason to think it
would be different this time.
   ``These OPEC agreements all tend to have a half-life of a couple
of months,'' said Edward Krapels, head of Energy Security Analysis
Inc., a Washington-based forecasting and consulting company that
advises clients on oil price trends. ``We expect them to erode
quickly.''
   Nonetheless, Krapels and others said, it is dangerous to dismiss
the rhetoric and behavior of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, the single-most powerful influence on the fuel
that drives the world economy.
   Although OPEC's word cannot necessarily be trusted, the cartel
often has achieved exactly what most of its members want: stable or
higher prices in a market that easily could become submerged in
more oil than it can absorb.
   ``The fact remains that anytime the price of oil is in the
teens, that is not a natural market price,'' said Stephen Smith, an
oil analyst for the Bear Stearns Cos. investment firm in New York.
``Someone is not producing.''
   Without any price discipline, oil inevitably would tumble toward
the price it costs the leading OPEC producers to extract from the
ground, which ranges from $1 to $8 a barrel.
   ``The fundamental problem of the oil business is that there's
just too much fo the stuff around,'' said Krapels.
   While suddenly cheap oil may sound desirable, it could set off a
chain reaction of volatility and panic worldwide. Developing
countries that rely on oil revenues could default on billions of
dollars in loans, for example. The oil-producing areas of the
United States, which are just climbing out of a prolonged
recession, could plunge back into another one.
   Ministers called the emergency OPEC meeting in Geneva in
response to a 25 percent drop in crude prices since the beginning
of this year, from more than $20 a barrel down to the $15-16 level
this spring.
   Although prices recently have edged back up, the remote but
underlying fear remained a production free-for-all that would send
oil back toward the $10 nadir reached five years ago.
   Much of the most recent drop was attributed to violations of
self-imposed output limits by three OPEC members that historically
have played a crucial role in cartel policy, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates.
   Under this the Geneva agreement, each member will contribute
toward reducing the cartel's output by about 1.5 million barrels a
day, bringing it down to roughly 22 million barrels vs. 23.5
million barrels in April. Theoretically, that would eliminate much
of the glut that has depressed prices and coincide with the
seasonally higher demand for oil during the summer.
   Instead of rallying, however, the oil market weakened. On the
New York Mercantile Exchange, an important barometer of demand, the
June delivery price of West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 69
cents a barrel on the day the accord was reached, to $17.99. The
price closed out the week Friday at $17.98.
   Some strategists said that despite skepticism about the
durability of the OPEC commitment, they believed most members _
including the chronic quota violators _ were worried enough about
price instability to stay honest for awhile.
   ``I take what OPEC says with a grain of salt, because they
lie,'' said William Randol, an international oil specialist at the
First Boston Co. investment bank in New York. Nonetheless, he said,
OPEC fear of a price plunge, combined with inevitably higher
demand, would strengthen prices eventually.
   ``A clumsy agreement is better than no agreement at all,'' said
Krapels. ``OPEC, even clumsily, is pretty effective.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Fears of an economic slowdown arose with the Labor Department
report that the U.S. unemployment rate climbed to 5.4 percent, the
highest level in more than year. But the stock and bond markets
found consolation in the jobless figures on the theory that a
weaker economy will ease pressure for higher interest rates.
   _More bad news than cars seemed to roll off the assembly lines.
The major domestic automakers reported sharp drops in first-quarter
earnings, primarily because of steep production cuts and weak sales
in the North American market.
   _Two of the biggest themes of the 1980s, takeovers and
securities fraud, received major legal jolts. The Supreme Court
ruled that corporate mergers can be dismantled through antitrust
suits brought by private citizens, further dampening the takeover
business. Separately, a federal appeals court nullified a
Securities and Exchange Commission rule widely used in insider
trading prosecutions.

<HEAD>Stock Outlook Tied Up in Bonds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the time the government finishes selling
$30.5 billion in bonds and notes over the next few days, Wall
Streeters hope the outlook will have brightened for the stock
market.
   The record-sized quarterly auction of Treasury securities slated
for Tuesday through Thursday has been hashed over for weeks among
stock and bond analysts.
   For a time, some observers believed it would compel the Federal
Reserve to tighten its monetary policy merely to make sure that a
decent contingent of bidders from around the world showed up.
   In the past few days, however, the mood in the markets seemed to
perk up, with long-term interest rates already at their highest
levels since last year around this time.
   While hopes increased a bit that rates might be near a turning
point, investors were confronted with a new cause for pause _ that
the zigzagging economy might once more be veering in the direction
of a recession.
   ``The economy is starting to weaken again,'' assert the
economists David A. Levy and S. Jay Levy in the latest edition of
their newsletter Industry Forecast.
   ``Right now, many investors are talking about worsening
inflation and a pickup in the economy. Three months from now,
recession fears will dominate their thinking and the inflation
danger will have been all but forgotten.''
   Talk of a pickup in business activity and increasing
inflationary pressures was abruptly quieted Friday, when the Labor
Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate rose
two-tenths of a percentage point in April to 5.4 percent.
   The figures also showed an increase of 64,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, far less than economists had been expecting.
   That presumably didn't bode well for corporate earnings in the
second quarter and beyond, at a time when some forecasters had been
looking for profits to start pulling out of their recent slump.
   Nevertheless, some analysts say other, positive forces are at
work in the market for Treasury securities that shouldn't be
overlooked. For one thing, they say, an increased emphasis on
savings over spending in this country has started to ease the
United States's much-lamented dependency on foreign capital to
finance its deficit spending.
   Stock traders seemed willing at least to listen to such
arguments in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
rose 65.31 to 2,710.36.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 4.63 to
185.37; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
added 10.63 to 428.61, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 3.09 at 345.73.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 139.90 million shares a day,
against 135.59 million the week before.
   In recent years, observed John Connolly at Dean Witter Reynolds,
``every major government refunding has become a cliff-hanger. Will
foreign investors show up, or will the auctions be a flop? Such
uncertainty breeds higher interest rates.''
   But more recently, Connolly contends, the trends that helped
create this situation have shifted.
   ``The savings rate has risen steadily, which, combined with
higher incomes, has substantially increased the pool of savings. At
the same time the government deficit has abated somewhat.
   ``The numbers are changing, and this will eventually affect
markets,'' he concludes. ``The United States has, in the last two
years, made major strides toward financial self-sufficiency.''

<HEAD>Managers Buying Deutz-Allis From German Company Say They're

<TEXT>
   A group of Deutz-Allis Corp. managers
who are buying the farm equipment maker from its West German parent
said Friday they hope to profit from pent-up demand for
agricultural equipment.
   ``We're extremely optimistic,'' said Robert Ratliff, president
and chief executive officer of Deutz-Allis and leader of the
five-member management buyout team. ``All of us recognize that the
ag economy has recovered and is strongly positioned for the
future.''
   The group formed a holding company, Allis-Gleaner Co., with
financing from New York-based Hamilton Robinson and Company, Inc.,
to purchase Deutz-Allis from its German parent,
Kloekner-Humboldt-Deutz AG (KHD), Ratliff said.
   He refused to disclose the sale price.
   The new owners plan no organizational or product changes, they
said, and will honor all existing contracts, warranties and dealer
agreements in the U.S. and Canada.
   ``The only change is that we're bringing the company back to
U.S. ownership,'' Ratliff said.
   KHD formed Deutz-Allis in 1985 after buying the farm equipment
manufacturing line of Allis-Chalmers Corp. The company lost $80
million in 1987 in the midst of the farm recession but narrowed
that to $8.8 million last year after cutting costs and laying off
half its 1,800 employees.
   Under its new owners, the company will continue distributing
Deutz-Allis tractors and hay, tilling and lawn and garden equipment
in the U.S. through an agreement with KHD.
   Deutz-Allis also will continue operating its sales and service
network of about 800 U.S. dealers and continue making Gleaner crop
harvesting combines at a plant in Independence, Mo.
   Deutz-Allis, with sales of $307 million last year, holds a small
fraction of the U.S. farm equipment market dominated by Deere &amp;
Company and J.I. Case, said Tobias Levkovich, an industry analyst
for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``They're a shell of what they used to be,'' Levkovich said.
   But he predicted the company could still benefit from a farm
economy upswing he estimated would last three to five years.
   ``The business right now is very strong,'' Levkovich said, with
both sales of large tractors and combines climbing in recent months.
   KHD had announced the sale Thursday in West Germany. It also
confirmed it was selling its aerospace technology subsidiary to
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW).
