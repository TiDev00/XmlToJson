<HEAD>Watkins Acknowledges High Radiation Emissions from Atomic Weapons
Plant</HEAD>

   Energy Secretary James Watkins said Wednesday
a nuclear weapons plant in the Pacific Northwest released enough
radiation in the 1940s to pose a serious health hazard to nearby
residents.
   It was the first time the government has acknowledged that
radiation emissions from the Hanford Nuclear Reservation were high
enough to cause illnesses, incluuding cancer, in people living
nearby.
   Watkins, speaking in advance of a study on the Richland, Wash.,
plant to be released Thursday, said, ``The implications of the
report are serious.''
   Watkins said the report is expected to ``contain estimates of
potentially large doses'' of radiation from the Hanford plant from
1944 to 1947.
   ``When I say high I mean significantly high _ 3,000 rads,
thousands of rads,'' he said.
   A rad is a measure of radiation exposure to human tissue. The
Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires that facilities it licenses
limit yearly radiation exposure from airborne emissions to 15
thousandths of a rad.
   He said between 350,000 and 400,000 curies of radioactive
material was released in one episode in 1945. A curie is the amount
of radiation emitted in one second by 1,400 pounds of enriched
uranium.
   The study being released Thursday is the first part of a
five-year, $15 million study that is the first major research into
accidental and intentional release of massive amounts of radiation
that drifted from Hanford into ten nearby Washington and Oregon
counties.
   The report will cover emissions, but not the health effects of
the radiation, said Angela Beers, spokeswoman for the panel of 18
non-government scientists and experts that directed the review.
   But a parallel study under way at the Centers for Disease
Control will use the exposure estimates to try to document cases of
thyroid disease among Hanford area residents, she said.
   Watkins said at his press conference that the main source of
worrisome exposure was radioiodine, the same isotope that caused
radiation sickness in some residents who lived near the Soviet
Union's nuclear power plant at Chernobyl when radiation was
released in a 1986 accident.
   A number of people who lived across the Columbia River from
Hanford's nine reactors claimed the 1940s emissions caused cancer
and thyroid-related illnesses.
   ``I don't want you to think we do this today,'' Watkins said.
``We are not casual about this today. But we do have to go back and
look at what happened to people. We don't know who was at the right
spot at the wrong time ... We have to learn lessons out of this and
be sensitive to the human beings who were there at the time.''
   The Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project uses
computer models to estimate how much radiation escaped when
plutonium was produced at the 560-square-mile nuclear plant.
   Scientists will use the first-phase estimates to test and refine
computer models over the next two years, during the second phase,
said John Till, a South Carolina nuclear scientist and the panel's
chairman.
   Radioactive iodine was produced when spent reactor fuel rods
were chemicall dissolved to produce weapons-grade plutonium and
uranium. When it concentrates in the thyroid gland, iodine-131 can
cause cancer and other diseases.
   Judith Jurji, president of the Hanford Downwinders Coalition,
said she and five members of her family have hypothyroidism, which
causes sluggishness and puffiness. Her father and two uncles worked
at Hanford from 1949 to 1956.
   However, it would be very difficult to prove a long-term illness
was caused by exposure more than 40 years ago and law prohibits
lawsuits against the government, said Jim Thomas of the
Spokane-based Hanford Education Action League.
   Researchers studied air emissions from 1944 to 1947 and
contaminated cooling water emissions into the Columbia River from
1964 to 1967, in part because those were years of highest radiation
releases and the best documented, Ms. Beers said.
   Weapons-grade plutonium was produced at the plant from 1943
until 1988, but radiation emissions steadily decreased over the
last 30 years.
   The Energy Department is paying for the study but has no
supervisory authority.

<HEAD>NBC Wins With `Cheers,' `Cosby,' `Seinfeld' Reruns, `Blossom'
Pilot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Summer replacement series gave television
viewers some alternatives during the July Fourth holiday week, but
reruns got the top ratings.
   Networks ``put the dogs on,'' said David Marans, a senior
researcher for the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency. ``These
are shows that will not be on the fall schedule. Almost without
exception the public has not liked these shows.''
   According to A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings released Tuesday, the four
half-hours of NBC's top-rated Thursday night lineup won the week's
highest ratings. It was the first time since February that NBC had
the top four shows.
   A ``Cheers'' rerun was No. 1; a repeat of ``The Cosby Show'' was
second; the pilot episode of ``Blossom,'' a potential midseason
entry, was third; and a repeat of ``The Seinfeld Chronicles'' pilot
was fourth.
   Marans said ratings for ``Blossom'' were boosted by having
``Cosby'' precede it, just as the top-rated ``Cheers'' episode
pulled up the ``Seinfeld'' ratings.
   ``Those shows were all weaker than the repeats that went on
before them,'' Marans said. ``The networks have got to be very
disappointed.''
   ``Blossom'' turned in the best performance for an NBC pilot so
far this summer, the network said. The comedy stars Mayim Bialyk,
who plays a 13-year-old coming of age in Los Angeles.
   The second highest-rated summer sitcom was ABC's ``Dad's a
Dog,'' which stars David Steinberg. It opened in 21st place.
   Overall, NBC was the No. 1 network for the eighth consecutive
week with a 9.0 average, but was barely ahead of ABC, which had an
8.9 average. CBS was third with a 7.6 average. The Fox Broadcasting
Co. had a 6.0 average.
   A rating point represents 921,000 households.
   NBC has won 39 of the past 42 weeks, but Marans said NBC's
losses and ABC's gains will have the two networks closely battling
for first place in the weeks ahead.
   Rounding out the top 10 shows were CBS' ``Designing Women'' and
``60 Minutes'' at fifth and sixth, NBC's ``Empty Nest'' at No. 7,
NBC's ``Golden Girls'' and CBS' ``Murphy Brown'' tied for eighth,
and ABC's ``Roseanne'' and Fox's ``Married ... with Children'' tied
for 10th.
   Fox had two other shows in the top 20, ``In Living Color'' at
No. 15 and ``Cops'' at 17.
   In the evening news broadcasts, ABC continued its domination
with an 8.4 rating. CBS was second with a 7.4 rating and NBC was
third with a 6.9.

<HEAD>Drug Dealer Waits `For Business to Come to Me'</HEAD>

   Dressed in expensive gold jewelry and designer
casual wear, a man being arraigned on drug possession charges says
he made up to $90,000 over three years in Washington's illegal
narcotics trade.
   ``I can go out here, stand on a corner and wait for business to
come to me, you know,'' the man who identified himself only as
Archie, a 21-year-old District of Columbia resident, said Tuesday.
   ``I work for somebody, but I don't have anybody standing over
me. I just have to give the people what they want, take their
money, make sure it gets back to where it belongs and get my cut,''
he said.
   Archie said he made ``between $75,000 to $90,000 over three
years.''
   The lure of making large sums of money in a short period of time
is the main reason why many poor, black urban males in the nation's
capital participate in the underground drug trade, according to a
study released by the Rand Corp. on Tuesday.
   The report was based on information gathered among 186
Washington, D.C., men aged 18-40 who said they had been involved in
drug activity and were on probation. It said the average
street-level operative is a poor, urban black male who makes a
median income of $24,000 annually from narcotics sales.
   Archie, who is black and who lives in a poorer section of
Washington, fits the statistical profile. He said he viewed the
charges facing him in D.C. Superior Court as part of the cost of
plying his illegal trade.
   ``I don't have no supervisor. I don't have no overhead and I
don't have no hassles. The only thing I got to worry about is being
picked up by the law,'' he said.
   ``This is my fifth arrest, but I've never been convicted and
this just interrupts what I do.''
   Archie's lawyer, Angela Burns, confirmed that her client had
been arrested five times in the past three years on drug and
weapons charges but had no convictions.
   The Rand report also used information supplied by the city
government about the 24,000 people arrested for selling or
possessing drugs from 1985 through 1987, and a survey of 387 boys
aged 15 to 18.
   The report estimated that in 1987, an estimated 24,000 district
residents were selling drugs on the street. For the three in eight
who were dealing drugs every day, the median monthly earnings were
$2,000, or $30 an hour _ tax-free _ after expenses.
   That compares with the $7 an hour from the legitimate jobs that
75 percent of the probationers reported holding.
   The study found that dealers active at least two days a week
face a 22 percent chance of going to prison, a 7 percent chance of
severe injury and a 1.4 percent chance of being killed _ a fatality
rate 100 times that of the general work force.
   Given those risks, ``long periods of steady earnings are
unlikely to be common,'' the report said.
   The estimated median income of street-level drug dealers was
higher than the average $12,898 earned by retail trade workers in
1987-88, according to the city government.
   Construction workers made $24,879, on average, while service
industry workers made $26,545. The average annual salary for all
private sector workers was $25,857, while government employees made
$32,118.
   But those workers are subject to federal and local income tax
withholding.
   Economist Peter Reuter, the chief author of the Rand study,
said, ``The creation of considerably higher paying legitimate jobs
probably wouldn't get us very far. Dealers would still have smaller
total incomes than they can earn now by supplementing their regular
wages with drug selling. Also, many of them have expensive drug
habits.''
   Reuter said in an interview that, while most street-level sales
were by blacks, the availability of drugs in Washington affects not
just the city's predominantly black population but white
suburbanites as well.
   While a typical city street dealer's earnings aren't enough to
finance flashy cars and lavish lifestyles, it is the image of such
luxuries that draw many young men into selling drugs, he said.

<HEAD>For One Day at Least, England is No. 1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY SIDDONS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Its stadiums are shabby, its fans remain rowdy and
it still can't produce a tennis player good enough to get past the
second round at Wimbledon.
   Forget all that. England was back on top of the sports heap
Tuesday, at least from its own island vantage point.
   Fans could fill themselves with pride along with beer at the
local pub as, within 4{ hours on a typically cloudy summer day, two
events restored the nation so long associated with the downside of
sport to No. 1.
   First, the European soccer federation voted to readmit English
clubs into two of its three continental tournaments next year.
   The clubs were banned in 1985 when 39 people died in a rampage
by English fans through a Belgian stadium.
   ``We Are Back!'' read the inch-high headline on the Evening
Standard, London's afternoon newspaper.
   Sports Minister Colin Moynihan hailed it as ``the dawning of a
new era.''
   Then, just as the country was drinking in that dram of good news
came a double shot: England won a cricket series on home soil for
the first time in five years.
   BBC-TV interrupted its news headlines to announce the victory.
   The excitement was understandable. England gave the game to the
world but in recent years the world has caught up, and the last
time the English won a home-field Test series _ a string of major
international matches each lasting five days _ was against
Australia in 1985.
   They defeated Sri Lanka at home in 1988, but that was something
like the Oakland Athletics beating the Toledo Mud Hens.
   Tuesday's events heightened an already giddy feeling around
English sports.
   The national soccer team did much better than expected at the
World Cup, reaching the semifinals before losing in a shootout to
West Germany, the eventual champion. Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher wants to have the players over for tea, an invitation that
would have been unthinkable just a month ago, given the national
humiliation brought upon her country by rowdy fans.
   English race-car driver Nigel Mansell is a favorite at this
weekend's British Grand Prix Formula 1 event, and next week Nick
Faldo of England, probably the best golfer in the world, has a
chance to add the British Open to his U.S. Masters titles from the
last two years.
   But all is not as rosy as an English garden.
   Soccer authorities still don't know how they will meet new
stadium safety rules imposed after 95 deaths in a crush of fans at
a game last year. The government remains red-faced over the
expulsion of more than 300 English soccer fans from Italy after
fights in Sardinia, Rimini and Turin.
   And the tennis! The land of Fred Perry and Virginia Wade failed
to get a player into the third round of the men's or women's
singles at Wimbledon again this year, and British bookies laid odds
before the tournament of 1,000-to-1 against a home-grown men's
champion and 2,000-1 against a women's winner.
   The odds against an alien landing on earth this century are
100-1.
   Those bookies may hum ``God Save the Queen'' as they figure the
hunches, but they don't let the tune cloud their minds.
   When The European soccer federation announced its decision on
readmission, William Hill, one of the country's biggest bookmakers,
offered 7-1 against an English club winning a European trophy next
season.

   The Bush administratation says the most useful
thing it can do now for the Soviet Union, rather than send cold,
hard cash, is to give it a few lessons in good old American
know-how.
   Sending experts abroad to help needy countries, known as
``technical assistance'' in foreign-policy jargon, has been a
centerpiece of the U.S. foreign aid program for years. And now it
is a feature of the new spirit of cooperation between the
superpowers.
   Some allies, including West Germany and France, hoped the United
States and other industrial democracies would go much further _ and
agree at the economic summit in Houston to fashion a coordinated
package of direct assistance to the reeling Soviet economy.
   President Bush, among others, resisted. The dispute was blunted,
for the time being, when the seven summit partners agreed instead
Tuesday to organize a quick study of the Soviet Union's needs.
   Meanwhile, the summit leaders gave Gorbachev a warm endorsement
and pledged to ``help in practical ways those countries that choose
freedom.''
   And a tentative draft of the communique to be issued at the
close of the summit today said ``Prospects for fundamental and
long-term economic aid could improve if the Soviet Union comes to a
substantial change in resources from military to civilian
production, and ends the support to those states which create
regional conflict.''
   The Western leaders called for group of international financial
institutions, under International Monetary Fund supervision, to
conduct the Soviet study and complete it by year's end. But the
World Bank, part of that group, immediately pronounced the deadline
unrealistic, saying ``a study of this nature would take a long time
_ a year or so.''
   In the interim, for the United States to extend even technical
assistance is a gesture that is downright revolutionary, when
measured by the standards of just 8{ years ago.
   After the Polish government's crackdown, with Soviet
acquiescence, on the Solidarity labor union in December 1981, the
Western allies were debating how severely to punish the Soviets
economically. Now the debate is focused on how much the Kremlin
should be rewarded for its change of heart under Mikhail
Gorbachev's stewardship.
   Bush and Gorbachev set in motion the concept of U.S. technical
assistance at the Malta summit seven months ago. Officials now say
an acceleration of that cooperation may be possible.
   Technical assistance can cover a variety of different endeavors.
In Panama, it means helping the government form a new police force.
In Nicaragua, U.S. experts are helping to implement the
government's economic policy. In El Salvador, American advisers are
trying to upgrade the country's woefully deficient judicial system.
   The U.S. position on the Soviet Union is that direct aid would
merely be wasted by a system plagued by gross inefficiencies. Baker
said on Tuesday the biggest favor the West could do for the Soviets
would be to offer its advice to help Gorbachev achieve his goal of
streamlining the Soviet economy. A number of private experts agree
with that approach.
   Some ideas which are at various stages of discussion include
helping the Soviets devise a consumer price index and a stock
market in a transition to a market economy.
   Leon Aron of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research
group, said the United States is uniquely positioned among the
allies to offer advice on these areas to a country as large as the
Soviet Union because of the scale of the U.S. economy.
   Aron rejected the suggestion of some European nations that
direct financial aid to the Soviet Union is feasible. He said that
because of systemic inefficiencies, there is $8 billion worth of
imported equipment languishing unopened in Soviet ports.
   ``A blank check is wasted,'' he said.
   Ed A. Hewitt of the Brookings Institution said U.S. experts
could aid the Soviets in overcoming such problems as getting food
to the market place. About a third of all Soviet food rots before
reaching the dinner table because of inadequate transportation or
storage facilities, he said.
   Both Hewitt and Richard Feinberg, executive vice president of
the Overseas Development Council, strongly support a major role for
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in helping the
Soviets.
   Financial stabilization and structural changes are sorely needed
in the Soviet Union and are precisely the areas the bank and the
fund have been set up to deal with, Feinberg said.
   The IMF makes loans to developing countries providing they agree
to undertake measures that it believes are necessary to put them on
a sounder economic footing.
   Feinberg says that among the IMF's success stories are Turkey,
Mexico, Bolivia and Chile. Critics argue that IMF policies have
impoverished some countries.
   The Soviets are not now in a position to benefit from the fund
or the bank because they are not members of either institution. But
they have indicated a desire to join, and the Bush administration
reportedly is weighing options on the subject.
   There are other ways the United States could help the Soviets
short of direct assistance.
   As an example, if the Kremlins drop barriers to emigration, the
United States could waive the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment,
thereby permitting normal trade between the two countries.
   That step, in turn, could be followed by U.S. trade credits and
the easing of high technology exports. The Soviets may act on the
emigration question in September.
   Will direct U.S. aid ever be in the cards?
   ``I don't think you should ever say never,'' Baker said Tuesday.
``Things can change.''

   Gun groups and their critics are already
gearing up for a fight in the House as the Senate prepares to
approve a major anti-crime bill with curbs on nine kinds of
semiautomatic assault rifles.
   ``We are certainly going to lobby to keep the House crime bill
free of gun control, and when they get to a conference committee we
are going to try to strip the gun provisions out of the Senate
bill,'' National Rifle Association lobbyist James Baker said
Tuesday.
   The Senate planned to vote today on its crime package, which
would ban the import or domestic manufacture of nine semiautomatic
weapons.
   The measure also calls for capital punishment for 34 federal
offenses ranging from presidential assassination to treason.
   Before voting on the measure, the Senate first must wrap up one
loose end involving provisions designed to combat savings and loan
fraud.
   Debate over other specific provisions of the bill, however, was
completed last month and the measure is not expected to have
trouble winning approval.
   The bill also would limit death row appeals with an eye toward
ending delays of a decade or more in carrying out executions. But
states would have to provide free lawyers to carry out the appeals.
   Other provisions would toughen the nation's money-laundering
laws, increase aid for local law enforcement, strengthen federal
investigative agencies, expand funding for ``boot camp'' prisons
and create a ``police corps'' scholarship program for peace
officers.
   And the bill calls for penalties for using and dealing in the
new drug ``ice'' and adds steroids to the list of controlled
substances.
   The House Judiciary Committee is working on its own version of
comprehensive crime legislation.
   That measure does not contain major firearms provisions, but the
House panel already has approved a firearms bill that is awaiting
floor action. It could easily be combined with the crime measure,
congressional aides said.
   The House gun bill would outlaw domestic semiautomatic weapons
that fail to meet the ``sporting purposes'' test under which a
number of firearms manufactured overseas are now kept out of the
country.
   The NRA, traditionally an influential force on Capitol Hill, was
beaten repeatedly in the Senate as it sought over the last two
months to strip firearms provisions out of the crime bill.
   Sponsors credited lobbying by police organizations. The
Washington-based group Handgun Control Inc. had also been pushing
hard to maintain the curbs on semiautomatic weapons.
   The Senate bill at one time was part of President Bush's
anti-crime package. But over the last year it has virtually been
rewritten on Capitol Hill, and the administration now lacks
enthusiasm for it.
   The campaign for curbs on semiautomatic assault rifles began
after a 1989 Stockton, Calif., schoolyard massacre by a man
carrying a semiautomatic version of an AK-47 rifle.
   Banned for import or domestic manufacture under the bill would
be:
   Norinco, Mitchell and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs
(including the AK-47); Action Arms Israeli Military Industries Uzi
and Galil; Beretta AR-70 (SC-70); Colt AR-15 and CAR-15; Fabrique
Nationale FN-FAL, FN-LAR and FNC; MAC-10 and MAC-11; Steyr AUG;
INTRATEC TEC-9 and the Street Sweeper and the Striker.

   NASA rejected a bidder on the Hubble Space
Telescope that planned tests to detect focusing flaws and instead
picked a company that proposed no such tests and made mirrors with
a fuzzy view of the universe, a space agency official says.
   Eastman Kodak Co., in its effort to win the contract to build
the Hubble mirrors, proposed a ``final assembly testing'' of the
telescope optics, NASA Deputy Administrator James R. Thompson told
a Senate panel Tuesday.
   NASA, however, gave the contract to Perkin-Elmer Corp., now
Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc., which did not plan the fully
assembled tests, and the agency chose not to order the tests
because they were so expensive, Thompson said.
   The Hubble Telescope, now in orbit, is disabled because of a
focusing flaw that might have been found by tests proposed in the
Kodak bid.
   ``In retrospect, perhaps an all-systems test could have been
done or should have been done,'' Thompson told the science and
space subcommittee.
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
declined to say why Perkin-Elmer was selected for the Hubble
contract, but NASA spokesman Bill Sheehan said ``Perkin-Elmer had,
on balance, more strength.''
   Perkin-Elmer's experience in building spy satellites may have
been a factor, other sources said.
   The Danbury, Conn., firm's winning bid in 1977 was for $63.4
million, but the total value of the contract swelled through cost
overruns and changes to $451 million. Almost $20 million of that
was paid by NASA as award fees, which are given based on
performance evaluation.
   Stephen Beale, a NASA procurement officer, said an additional
$4.3 million in award fees for the company are under consideration.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., who chaired the hearing, charged that
NASA's recent problems with a crippled telescope and a space
shuttle fleet grounded by hydrogen leaks may be related to an
agency ``mindset to reject any pessimistic news.''
   Gore said Congress was ``no longer going to be satisfied'' with
what he called ``NASA's proclivity to shoot the messenger and not
give credence to troublesome studies.''
   He said the agency, for instance, rejected some studies
predicting that within the next decade there could be another
accident like the Challenge explosion that killed seven astronauts
in 1986.
   Thompson, in a heated exchange, called the charge unfair.
   He said NASA recognized that there are risks in space flight and
that another space shuttle could be lost eventually.
   ``If you fly 100 times and I tell you that we're not going to
lose another one, that wouldn't pass the sanity test,'' said
Thompson. ``If we fly 100 more, we may lose another one.''
   But he added: ``I think the chance is very, very low with the
team we have in place.''
   Meanwhile, Hubble Space Telescope experts told a news conference
that they have moved closer to determining which of two mirrors on
the observatory spacecraft had been cut to the wrong prescription.
   ``All of the evidence is beginning to point toward the primary
mirror and not the secondary mirror,'' said Ed Weiler, chief
project scientist for the Hubble.
   The telescope has two mirrors, a 94-inch primary and a 12-inch
secondary, that are suspects in the focusing flaw that has
handicapped Hubble. Experts are working to determine which mirror
is flawed. This will help make corrective optics for a replacement
camera that will be installed by 1993.
   If the primary mirror is at fault, Weiler said, it will be
easier to correct than if the problem was in the secondary mirror.
The secondary mirror reflects light from the primary mirror into
the telescope's instruments.

   Former Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr., whose
crimes included extorting more than half a million dollars from a
coal operator, has been sentenced to five years and 10 months in
prison and fined $170,000.
   Moore, 67, appeared stoic during his sentencing Tuesday on five
corruption charges. He was ordered to report to a federal prison in
Petersburg, Va., on July 31.
   ``Arch Moore is a criminal,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Savage
said before sentencing. ``If there is one thing missing from that
man, it's remorse.''
   Moore pleaded guilty to charges of mail fraud, extortion,
obstruction of justice and filing false income tax returns during
his 1984 and 1988 campaigns and during his third term, from 1985-89.
   U.S. District Judge Walter Hoffman on Monday had refused to let
Moore withdraw his guilty pleas. Moore had argued he was coerced by
federal prosecutors.
   Moore, a Republican who also was a U.S. congressman for 12
years, refused to comment on the sentence. An appeal is pending,
defense attorney William Hundley said.
   Moore's corruption involved campaign-funding violations, not
raids on the treasury, Hundley said.
   ``I submit he served well and honorably,'' Hundley added.
   U.S. Attorney Michael Carey said Moore likely will serve at
least 2{ years before being considered for parole.
   Moore served as governor from 1969 to 1977 and again from 1985
to 1989, longer than any governor in the state's history. He was
only the second Republican since 1933 to govern West Virginia,
where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 2-to-1 margin.
   Moore pleaded guilty May 8 to extorting $573,000 from coal
operator H. Paul Kizer of Beckley in return for a $2.1 million
refund from the state's Black Lung Fund, which provides benefits to
coal miners.
   Moore also pleaded guilty to trying to block a federal grand
jury investigation into corruption in his administration and
allegations he used illegal cash contributions in his 1988 campaign.
   He also admitted filing false income tax returns in 1984 and
1985 and defrauding the state of his salary and benefits by
funneling $100,000 in illegal cash payments into his 1984 campaign
to buy votes.
   Hoffman sentenced Moore to five years on the extortion charge,
six months on mail fraud and two years each on the tax fraud
counts. All are to be served concurrently. Moore also got 10 months
for the obstruction of justice charge, which carries a mandatory
prison term.
   Moore could have gotten 36 years in prison and fines of $1.25
million.
   Moore is not the first West Virginia governor to be convicted on
federal charfes. Democrat W.W. ``Wally'' Barron, who served from
1961 to 1965, was convicted of bribing the foreman of a jury that
acquitted him of bribery in 1968. He served three years and four
months of a 12-year sentence.

   While the world's spotlight remains trained on
the deliberations of seven Western leaders here, the city of
Houston is plying the news media for its share of attention.
   About 4,000 reporters are in town for the economic summit, and
civic leaders have spared no effort to put them in a good mood
about the city. Already, favorable stories about Houston's
rebounding economy have brought calls from interested Japanese and
European corporations, Mayor Kathy Whitmire said Tuesday.
   ``We specifically asked for the opportunity to host the economic
summit because we wanted the chance to focus the worldwide
attention on what is happening here in Houston,'' Whitmire said
Tuesday.
   ``We felt that there ought to be some way that we can take
advantage of your presence here,'' she said.
   Boosters have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to
present the credentialed reporters with free food, alcohol,
T-shirts, tote bags and even toothpaste. That's become the standard
formula for any city playing host to pre-eminent news events like
summits, political conventions or sports extravaganzas.
   Houstonians make no secret of their motives.
   ``Frankly, the people from Washington told us early on that the
media attitude at previous summits was affected by the preparation
and presentation of the food,'' said Ben Love, a retired bank
chairman who helped organize the media center.
   But Houston was miffed when the three television networks turned
a cold shoulder to hot Houston and chose not to broadcast their
news shows from the summit, a snub that was front-page news locally.
   And when Whitmire and some pillars of the community staged a 9
a.m. summit news conference Tuesday in an auditorium that can hold
more than 1,000 people, 50 civic boosters outnumbered the handful
of reporters.
   ``I've heard ... you (reporters) stay up pretty late at night
and maybe don't get up so early in the morning,'' Love said. ``This
may be some confirmation of that.''
   No matter. The tiny turnout wasn't cause for concern.
   ``When I see 10 or 11 television cameras across the back of the
room, I'm very much aware of the potential they have for reaching
very large numbers of people,'' Whitmire said. ``You don't have to
have large numbers to impress me.''
   Past summit cities have found fame to be fleeting and the
economic impact of the event to be overrated. But Houston was
undeterred.
   A group of business and city leaders raised more than $10
million to host the summit. About $250,000 is being spent on a
``food pavilion'' _ buffet tables available to reporters 24 hours a
day.
   Whitmire says it's been a smart investment.
   ``I don't think I could put a dollar figure on the value of the
international attention that this community is receiving,'' she
said. ``I think it certainly will be many times over the amount
that's been invested. I can assure you of that.''
   However, not everyone was thrilled about the summit.
   Houston City Councilman John Goodner told reporters Tuesday,
``I've had about all the honor of this I can stand.''
   ``In light of all the things that are going on, how difficult it
is to transverse this city, I would hope the next time that
President Bush or any other president wants to honor us, I hope he
honors Dallas,'' he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Twice in Two Weeks; Is Summitry Wearing Thin?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Anthems played, flags unfurled, videotape rolled.
And then the leaders of the Western world shook hands _ yet again.
   If the small talk was running thin, it didn't show.
   President Bush and several other summit leaders had been through
all the pomp and ceremony less than a week ago. That was at the
NATO gathering in London.
   For the four European leaders here, Houston was the third time
in three weeks that they've lined up for group photographs,
attended state banquets and pondered weighty communiques.
   Britain's Margaret Thatcher, West Germany's Helmut Kohl, Italy's
Giulio Andreotti and France's Francois Mitterrand began the long
summer of summitry in the Irish capital, Dublin, with a European
Community summit at the end of June.
   Only Japan's Toshiki Kaifu added a fresh face in Houston.
   Economic summits were once a highlight of the year, a rare
chance to hobnob with allied peers and walk the world stage.
   But with the upheaval in Eastern Europe and accelerating moves
toward closer unity among the West Europeans, summits have become
almost routine.
   During the Bush administration there have already been two
summits of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The European
Community, holding regular ``emergency summits,'' has virtually
doubled its regular six-monthly meetings.
   The dynamics are changing. But in the view of some analysts, the
lack of novelty doesn't diminish the significance.
   ``I think summits are more important now,'' said Robert Hormats,
a vice president of Goldman Sachs International, who from 1975 to
1982 was the U.S. economic ``sherpa,'' the aide who prepares the
president's agenda for summits.
   ``During the Cold War period, security concerns bound us
together in the West,'' he said. ``Now these will no longer be as
strong and you need something to bind _ and these will be economic
issues if they are managed correctly.''
   Hormats also sees summits as a discipline against insularity
and, for an economically less dominant United States, an important
forum for wielding influence through consensus.
   ``It keeps them all constructively engaged in the global system
because they know if they are not, someone will raise the point
when they next meet _ it's a collective peer pressure exercise,''
he said.
   It has also become a lot less formal behind the closed doors,
according to aides to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   She should know. She's the Western world's longest serving
leader and Houston was her 12th economic summit.
   In the beginning she routinely turned up at summits in combative
moods and often became the center of a dispute, particularly with
her fellow Europeans.
   ``But over the years she has come to recognize the value of
summits,'' said an aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The
leaders do get to know each other and now it's become easier. It
has also become a lot less predictable.''
   But what do they actually do, apart from talk?
   C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Washington-based Institute for
International Economics and a former senior U.S. Treasury official,
said that in the 1980s the economic summits drifted into general
political issues and became ``a lot less action-oriented.''
   ``In my view they deteriorated enormously,'' said Bergsten.
   ``I really hope and think there's a chance that this first one
of the 90s will go back ... to make some headway on a few concrete
issues,'' he added, citing farm subsidies, free trade and Soviet
aid.
   But Hormats, like many observers, thinks the summits could use a
lot fewer words, ceremonials, photo opportunities and the
blow-by-blow briefings that officials give to the hundreds of
reporters who gather round.
   ``It would be a lot better if they changed these laundry-list
communiques ... covering every conceivable issue,'' Hormats said.
``And in my view, these summits will have come of age when there
doesn't need to be so much hoopla.''
   Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the leaders, comfortable
with one another, hashed out most of the issues themselves _ rather
than relying on aides.
   ``The issues they've dealt with in this summit have been real
and dealt with by the heads at the table in a more direct way than
any I've ever seen,'' said Fitzwater, who has been to five economic
summits.
   For the summiteers, there's no relief in sight.
   The European Community has already scheduled an extra meeting in
October. NATO has invited President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to speak,
perhaps this year. And a really big summit _ a mass gathering of
the 35 nations of East and West in the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe _ is expected before year's end.

<HEAD>Most Cosmetic Surgery for Military Retirees, Dependents Halted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most cosmetic surgery to improve the
appearance of military dependents, retirees and their dependents
will be halted at military hospitals under a new Defense Department
policy.
   But such procedures will not be totally barred for active-duty
military personnel, a Pentagon spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   Such operations will be conducted ``only on a very limited
basis,'' said spokeswoman Susan Hansen. ``It will be done on the
lowest priority and there must be no other requirement for the
surgical theater at the time.''
   The Pentagon reviewed its policy on procedures such as
facelifts, breast enlargements and liposuctions after receiving an
inquiry from Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the House
Appropriations defense subcommittee.
   In April, the San Diego Tribune reported that the San Diego
Naval Hospital _ one of four Navy hospitals with an extensive
plastic surgery department _ had performed 544 cosmetic procedures
in the past two years, and that Air Force and Army hospitals
performed similar cosmetic surgeries.
   Pentagon officials have argued that it is important for military
surgeons to perform such procedures as part of their training.
   But following a review of the legislative history of the policy,
Defense Department officials decided that ``a better
interpretation'' of the legislation governing such procedures was
needed, Ms. Hansen said.
   ``Consequently, facelifts and other procedures relating to the
aging process and any procedure performed for personal,
non-therapeutic reasons to improve the appearance will not be
provided for active-duty dependents or retirees and their
dependents using appropriated funds,'' a Pentagon statement said.
   Surgeries for the correction of a congenital abnormality,
reconstructive surgery following an injury or surgical or
therapeutic trauma, and post-mastectomy breast reconstruction will
be allowed, the statement added.
   Ms. Hansen said the military services will develop procedures
``to assure that surgical residents and staff can meet the
requirements'' of certification by their the medical specialty
boards.
   The new regulations are expected to be identical to those
procedures covered under the Civilian Health and Medical Program
for the Uniformed Services, the insurance program known as CHAMPUS
that allows service members and their dependents to receive health
care in private facilities, Ms. Hansen said.
   CHAMPUS doesn't cover purely cosmetic surgery.

   Forget about the thornier negotiations between
the economic summit partners. Jackson Hicks, master caterer, knows
what real pressure is.
   Pressure is serving lunch to the most powerful leaders in the
Western world. No dropped trays. No splashy food. No hard-to-eat
entrees. Nothing that might embarrass a president, or hinder a
negotiation, or interrupt a profound thought.
   ``I've enjoyed taking care of many important people in my career
_ kings, queens, presidents, movie stars, businessmen,'' Hicks
said. ``But nothing was more challenging and exciting than taking
care of those world leaders.''
   Hicks, 43, might be considered the man who catered the summit.
His Houston company put on 13 meals and parties, from a
5,000-person media festival to a working lunch for the leaders.
   He's averaged less than two hours of sleep a night through the
summit, which ends today with a party to thank Houston hosted by
President Bush and catered by Hicks.
   ``We're used to pressure, but this has been a very intense thing
because of who these people are and because of the short window of
time,'' Hicks said. ``Everything's been on scheduled and come off
without a hitch'' _ except for one flat tire on the way to a
spouses' dinner, where Barbara Bush was host.
   It hasn't been easy. Intense security measures, especially when
moving around the Rice University campus, has doubled preparation
times, Hicks said. And Tuesday, his 170 workers served three
working luncheons at once.
   ``You have to make the food simple, not flashy, and not
difficult to eat. You want to be unobtrusive. They can't carry on
an important conversation if they're trying to crack a lobster
open,'' he said. ``This isn't the time to bring out some flaming
desert on the shoulders of a team of waiters.''
   Hicks thinks the White House tapped him for the job because of
his company's reputation and experience _ he's catered at the 1988
Winter Olympics, last year's Super Bowl, major Texas celebrations
and previous dinners for Bush. It didn't hurt, too, that many of
his regular clients are personal friends of the Bush family.
   Hicks, a tall man with gray hair curling to his shoulders, was a
wine buyer for the exclusive Neiman-Marcus retail chain before
striking out on his own in 1981.
   His cooks, bartenders and waiters all worked the same frenzied
hours as he did. They prepared 4,000 gulf oysters, 562 pounds of
beef fajitas, 1,000 bobwhite quail, 10,000 live crawfish and 200
pounds of venison sausage.
   He won't discuss what his food budget was, and until Tuesday,
couldn't even tell others he was working on the summit, let alone
what he planned to serve, for security reasons.
   Hicks served lots of grilled beef and chicken and tea
sandwiches. Fresh fruits and vegetables were popular with the
Western leaders, as were cold menus on hot Houston afternoons, he
said.
   While the issues on the tables of the Rice University meeting
rooms were intensely argued, Hicks came away impressed at how
friendly the leaders seemed to each other.
   ``Many of these people have known each other for a long time.
They just seemed relaxed with one another. The pictures and
ceremonies appeared formal, but inside, they weren't formal,''
Hicks said. ``I was very impressed with the graciousness and warmth
to one another.''

   Central American presidents called for
foreign support of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro on Tuesday
as a Sandinista-led strike turned Managua into a chaos of gunfire
and roadblocks.
   The wave of strikes that began last week has put the heaviest
pressure yet on the 10-week-old, U.S.-backed administration.
   Mrs. Chamorro called out the army late Monday to restore order.
Both the army and police are controlled by the leftist Sandinistas,
who ruled until April 25 and remain the largest single political
force in Nicaragua.
   Gunfire died down Tuesday morning, but by afternoon scattered
shooting resumed between Sandinistas and Chamorro supporters, who
included leaders of the disbanded Contra rebels.
   In once incident, one Sandinista soldier was shot and wounded
and another beaten Tuesday afternoon outside a radio station being
used as a headquarters by armed civilians opposed to the general
strike.
   The soldiers were passing by the pro-administration Radio
Corporation building in eastern Managua when they were attacked,
and the wounded soldier was taken to the hospital.
   The Sandinista opposition blames the Contras for the fighting,
which the Nicaraguan Human Rights Commission said had clamed four
lives and left at least 84 people injured sinced the strike began
on June 26.
   The violence began on Friday.
   The presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and
Honduras issued a joint communique Tuesday ``calling on the
international community to lend its valuable assistance to the
Nicaraguan government in its search for a solution to the crisis it
is undergoing.''
   Honduran government spokesman Martin Baide gave The Associated
Press a copy of the declaration, which he said was being
simultaneously released in the other Central American countries.
   Asked whether the United States was providing any technical or
intelligence assistance to Mrs. Chamorro, Secretary of State James
A. Baker III would not talk about any specifics.
   ``We've been very helpful to Mrs. Chamorro in the past,'' said
Baker, speaking at a news conference in Houston, where he was
attending the summit of the seven largest industrial democracies.
   ``And it goes without saying that we would want to be helpful in
securing democracy in Nicaragua ... so we would want to be
helpful.''
   Sandinista radio stations Radio Sandino and Radio Ya charged
Tuesday that Contra leaders were directing armed groups of urban
commandos. Reporters identified leaders of the Contras _ the rebels
supported by the United States while the Sandinistas were in power
_ among the armed groups.
   The Contras have been turning in their weapons under supervision
of the United Nations and the Organization of American States, and
Mrs. Chamorro has declared their nine-year resistance at an end.
   Police and soldiers tore down roadblocks in Managua and cleaned
up after street bonfires Tuesday, but strikers still occupied
government ministries and state-owned businesses in the city of
about 1 million people.
   Strike sympathizers built even more roadblocks to replace those
taken down.
   Whether the army and police will back Mrs. Chamorro's new
government or let the strike widen is considered crucial in the
outcome of the walkouts, now in their second week.
   ``We mustn't repress the people,'' one policeman said.
   The Sandinistas lost the presidential election to Mrs. Chamorro
on Feb. 25, ending 10 years of revolutionary rule of this country
of 3.7 million residents. The U.S. economic embargo, which helped
create shortages even in basic foodstuffs, contributed to their
defeat.
   Mrs. Chamorro won with the backing of a 14-party coalition that
ranged from far right to Communist, and had little more in common
than a distaste for the Sandinistas.
   The U.S. trade sanctions and a long war against the
U.S.-supported Contra rebels devastated the economy before Mrs.
Chamorro took office, and her reconstruction efforts have stirred
resentment and opposition.
   Sandinista-led unions called the strike to protest what they
said were massive firings of government workers and to demand a
voice in government economic policy, which they say favors the
wealthy under the new government.
   Labor leaders say 90,000 people are taking part in the strike.
Mrs. Chamorro's government declared the action illegal last week,
claiming it was politically motivated.
   Gunfire spread from eastern Managua's working-class
neighborhoods to the central section at the offices Radio
Corporation. The armed civilians who barricaded themselves there
said they were protecting the station from Sandinistas who wanted
to burn it. They said they tended up to 20 wounded in the radio
station but there had been no deaths.
   Many pro-Sandinista groups at the roadblocks carry Soviet-bloc
AK-47 assault rifles, standard issue in the Sandinista army.
   Thousands of AK-47s were distributed to Sandinista sympathizers
after the February election defeat. Government demands for return
of the weapons were largely ignored.
   Strikers have taken over most government ministries and many
state-run enterprises. The international airport is closed by an
air controllers' strike and water has been cut to parts of the city.
   Electrical service was restored Tuesday but workers said they
would start selective cuts around the city.
   Postal workers and telephone operators are on strike, leaving
the relatively few Nicaraguans with direct-dial capacity the only
ones who can communicate outside the country.
   Driving was difficult in some areas, impossible in others,
because of barricades.
   Hundreds of factories and businesses shut down Monday because
employees could not get to work.
   Some walked to their jobs.
   ``I will have to walk several kilometers to my job,'' said Marta
Gonzalez, a household maid. ``If I don't work, I don't eat.''
   Former President Daniel Ortega said any effort to end the strike
by force would invite ``generalized chaos.''
   He demanded a resumption of negotiations, suspended by the
government over the weekend because it said union leaders wanted to
discuss political, not economic issues.

   Rep. Harold Ford is going after
prosecutors, not politicians, as the eight-term congressman runs
his second re-election campaign under federal indictment.
   Tennessee's only black member of Congress, Democrat Ford
contends he is a victim of Justice Department lawyers with a taste
for prosecuting black leaders.
   ``They don't have the funds to investigate the savings and loan
industry, but they have the funds to investigate me twice,'' Ford
said in an interview. ``I'm going to put the prosecutors on trial
during this campaign.''
   Ford was indicted on bank and mail fraud charges in 1987 and was
on trial for 11 weeks in U.S. District Court in Memphis. A mistrial
was declared in April when jurors said they were unable to reach a
verdict.
   Prosecutors say a second trial will be held but no date has been
set.
   Ford and his backers liken his legal troubles to government
investigations of Washington Mayor Marion Barry, Rep. William Gray,
D-Pa., New York Mayor David Dinkins and other prominent black
politicians.
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, has taken up that argument
on Ford's behalf, as has Jesse Jackson.
   ``It's not just these leaders on trial,'' Jackson said at a
recent rally in Memphis. ``It's the Justice Department on trial.''
   Ford, 45, is a strong favorite for re-election. He faces state
Rep. Pam Gaia and perennial candidate Mark Flanagan in the Aug. 2
Democratic primary.
   Aaron Davis, a 79-year-old political newcomer, will represent
the Republicans in November. Isaac Richmond, an independent Ford
already has defeated several times, also is running.
   Ford said his legal troubles have done little to undermine his
political standing but the financial and emotional toll has been
high.
   ``They won't be able to hurt me politically, but financially,
this has been a drain,'' he said. ``It's been very difficult.''
   Ford is accused of taking payoffs disguised as loans from former
bankers Jake and C.H. Butcher Jr., who in 1983 set off the largest
banking collapse in Tennessee history.
   Ford said he expects his legal expenses to approach $2 million.
   Since his indictment, Ford has used about $350,000 in political
contributions for his legal defense, campaign records show. Ford
also has raised more than $380,000 through a legal defense fund
called ``Trust Ford.''
   The Republicans have not made a serious run for Ford's seat
since 1976 when he defeated a popular city councilman with 61
percent of the vote.
   In 1988, while under indictment, he drew no Republican
opposition and collected 80 percent of the vote in the Democratic
primary and in the general election.
   Ford is the most prominent member of a large family that has
long been active in Memphis politics. His brother, John, is a state
senator who also is running this year for county tax collector.
Another brother, James, is a city councilman.
   Ford directs a political organization that can turn out the vote
on Election Day. Many of his followers, especially those who are
poor and black, are fiercely loyal.
   His complaints of Justice Department bias will play well with
the voters, said the Rev. Samuel Kyles, a Ford supporter and
longtime Memphis civil rights leader.
   ``They'll respond to it because it is so clear,'' Kyles said.
   Ford's district, which includes most of Memphis, is 58 percent
black. Black registered voters slightly outnumber whites citywide.
   A champion of traditional Democratic causes, Ford has a
reputation for helping constituents with their personal problems,
whether they are dealing with federal agencies or local government.
   Ford, who was indicted in Knoxville in primarily white eastern
Tennessee, claims he was ``judicially kidnapped.'' He says he would
not have been charged by a grand jury in Memphis.
   Prosecutors contend Ford has so inflamed his followers that
finding an impartial jury for a second trial may be impossible
unless it is moved out of Memphis.
   Ford is widely considered a likely candidate for mayor of
Memphis if he can get the bank fraud indictment behind him. He says
he was preparing to announce a bid for mayor when he was indicted.

<HEAD>Police Arrest 11 Members of Medellin Cocaine Cartel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police delivered a major blow to the
Medellin cocaine cartel Tuesday, arresting 11 of its members in a
northeastern town and seizing arms including more than 3{ tons of
dynamite, officials said.
   Among those arrested was the personal physician of Pablo
Escobar, the cartel's leader, according to a national police report
read over the RCN radio network.
   The suspected cartel members were arrested in the town of Puerto
Triunfo, about 75 miles east of Bogota, the police report said.
   It said police also captured one of Escobar's relatives, Hernan
Dario Quintero, who reportedly supplied dynamite and weapons to
gunment hired to carry out the cartel's bombing and assassination
campaigns.
   The report added that police seized several Soviet-made AK-47
automatic rifles, revolvers, 7,700 pounds of dynamite,
sophisticated communications equipment and documents that could
lead to Escobar's capture.
   RCN did not give details about the other alleged cartel members
arrested in the raid. The national police press office did not
answer calls by The Associated Press late Tuesday seeking more
information.
   Escobar, who has been blamed for the murder of hundreds of
Colombians, remains at large despite a massive manhunt to find him.
   The government and drug traffickers have been locked in a war
since August, when traffickers were blamed for the assassination of
a popular presidential candidate.
   Bombings and assassinations blamed on drug thugs have since
claimed several hundred lives, while the government has pressed on
with its effort to capture and extradite drug suspects to the
United States.

   Tatana Maresova has sworn off meat
as long as she is breast-feeding.
   From the newspapers, now free of censorship, she knows meat is
often contaminated with harmful substances.
   Emissions from chemical plants, coal-burning industry and
two-cylinder cars guzzling a mixture of oil and gasoline have
polluted the air, made much of the country's water unfit to drink
and seeped into the food chain.
   Heavy industry was the measure of success during Communism rule,
when leaders did not concern themselves with environmental
protection. Czechoslovakia has soem of the worst environmental
damage in the East bloc.
   Marcela Peskova worries about the store-bought milk she gives
her two daughters.
   ``I know they get pollutants, but without it they couldn't
grow,'' she says, casting an anxious glance at Kristina, 5, and
Pavlina 4.
   Both mothers routinely boil the water their family drinks and
try to buy bottled mineral water for the babies.
   ``More than 50 percent of the water is not suitable for
drinking,'' says Josef Vavrousek, the man in charge of
environmental matters in the new government. ``More than half the
population is drinking damaging water.''
   Vavrousek is trying to assess the damage caused by heavy
industry and devise a viable program for solving environmental
problems.
   How long could that take?
   ``I think all my life,'' he says, only half joking. But he
believes it is possible to ``make very important improvements in
two, three or five years.''
   The first freely elected government in four decades has been
dubbed the ``government of national sacrifice'' by President Vaclav
Havel. While it wants to clean up the environment, it also has the
unpopular task of closing down money-losing industry and making the
economy more responsive to the laws of supply and demand.
   ``If the economy is not improved, the environment can't be
either,'' Vavrousek said.
   For the mothers raising their children in polluted Prague or the
heavily industrialized regions of northern Bohemia and Moravia,
pollution is a fact of life.
   The Lidova Demokracie daily recently quoted experts as saying
the milk of women between 18 and 34 is contaminated by PCBs, DDT,
and other toxic materials.
   The newspaper quoted a veterinarian as saying that under the
Communists, experts had tried to inform the government about PCB
contamination of meat, but the problems were disregarded.
   In the health field, a re-evaluation is under way now that the
Communists are out.
   ``Everything is in a state of upheaval,'' said Dr. Alena Chyska,
head of the Department for the Care and Development of the New
Generation in the Health Ministry.
   Ms. Chyska said birth defects and other health problems appeared
more common in heavily polluted areas, where children were also
more likely to contract respiratory-related illnesses and allergies.
   Until conditions improve, residents of Prague and other polluted
areas must rely largely on their own resources to protect their
health.
   ``If I had money, I would buy a country place,'' said Ms.
Peskova.
   Ms. Maresova is luckier.
   Her parents live in the countryside. Her 6-month-old baby Michal
was born with respiratory problems, but his health improved after
several months at her parents' place in the mountains in Slovakia.
   Her parents now raise vegetables in their garden. ``With the
baby, we need uncontaminated food,'' Maresova explained, as her
7-year-old son Tomas fidgeted next to her on the park bench.
   Did she miss taking some precautions with her first-born because
media discussion of enviromental problems was taboo under the
Communists?
   ``When my first child was growing up, really important
information seemed to seep through,'' she says.
   Vavrousek's No. 1 priority is to improve the quality of water
and food, first of all seeing that there is a good distribution of
bottled water.
   But muzzling sulphur-belching factories with filters won't be
easy. It is costly and requires technology not available in
Czechoslovakia.
   Plenty of Western companies have offered to help plug the
pollution hemorrhage.
   ``We've gotten hundreds of offers,'' Vavrousek said in an
interview in the offices he has occupied for just eight weeks.
``But we have two problems. We don't have the experience to
decipher the options, or the money to buy it.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savings and loan bailout officials are
shifting strategy and trying to save taxpayers' money by closing
troubled thrifts just before, rather than after, the institutions
fail.
   The board of the Resolution Trust Corp. voted 4-0 Tuesday to
adopt the ``accelerated resolutions program.'' It will become the
``preferred course of action'' for handling failing thrifts, RTC
Chairman L. William Seidman said.
   Officials estimate they could use the program for between 155
and 180 of the 260 S&amp;Ls expected to fail over the next year. They
plan to see how it works with 10 institutions over the summer.
   Previously, the trust corporation's tactic has been to seize an
insolvent institution, appoint a government managing agent to rein
in any highflying practices and sell the S&amp;L to whoever offers to
accept the least amount of government aid.
   The problem is that the last step was coming months, sometimes
more than a year, after the initial seizure. In the meantime,
longtime depositors and key employees were fleeing the institution,
reducing its value as an ongoing business.
   Under the new program, the agency hopes it will be able to spend
fewer taxpayer dollars by finding a buyer before an institution is
stigmatized as failed. The method is similar to how the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. handles commercial banks in trouble.
   Rather than publicly advertise for bids, the RTC will solicit
proposals for still-open, but weak, S&amp;Ls from a list of about 3,500
investors who have expressed an interest in acquiring failed
institutions.
   When a buyer is selected, the institution will be closed and
immediately reopened, relieving the new owners of legal claims
against the old institution.
   The old shareholders will lose their investment. The old
managers will keep or lose their jobs depending on whether they
played a part in causing the institution to fail.
   Generally, if no buyer is found within 90 days, the institution
will be seized by the government.
   ``This is a program designed to sell institutions in the most
efficient and quickest manner possible ... with the least possible
deterioration in value,'' Seidman said.
   Private analysts cautiously endorsed the strategy, although they
noted that the RTC has yet to deal with nearly 250 institutions
that failed previously. It has handled more than 200 failed thrifts
in its first 11 months.
   ``I think in principle it's a good idea. The only question is
whether they are so overloaded now with all the clearly insolvent
institutions,'' said Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, a
liberal-oriented Washington think tank.
   ``You're going to be using scarce resources for (marginally
insolvent) thrifts ahead of other institutions that are clearly in
much worse shape,'' he said.
   However, Litan said taxpayers might save money by bailing out an
institution on the edge of insolvency, when its owners may be most
tempted to gamble. A deeply insolvent S&amp;L under government control
often is not in danger of further deterioration, he said.
   ``If you're in the government, the thing to do is not to focus
on past losses but to focus on how to prevent future losses from
occurring,'' he said.
   Auburn University economist James Barth said the program might
be a better way of handling the loans, real estate and other assets
of a failed thrift.
   In the conventional S&amp;L bailouts so far, the government has been
stuck with about half of the assets, which it hopes to sell later.
Officials hope that in accelerated resolution deals, the new owner
rather than the government will get most of the assets.
   ``The RTC has so many assets it has to try new and different
things to get those assets back into the private sector,'' Barth
said. ``If they're not careful, they're going to wind up with the
world's largest troubled savings and loan and it's going to be
called the Resolution Trust Corp.''

<TEXT>
   New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is mixing policy
with politics in a new TV campaign ad that encourages people to
pick up the phone and let the Democratic candidate know where they
stand.
   Political consultants say the ad, which began running this week,
is a smart way to get constituents involved and could help the
two-term Democrat identify potential donors to be solicited for
campaign contributions.
   The ad, running on cable television in New Jersey, invites
viewers to call a toll-free number to register their views on
Bradley's proposal to ban leaded gasoline, or to request a brochure
on the dangers of lead poisoning.
   Democratic consultant Gary Nordlinger said constituents who call
the number and leave their names and addresses could be added to a
``fund-raising file'' for the senator's re-election id.
   During the 30-second commercial, Bradley doesn't appeal for
votes or money _ only for opinions on his proposed Lead Ban Act of
1990.
   In the ad, Bradley is seated in a kitchen and tells viewers:
``An alarming number of children all over New Jersey have high
levels of toxic lead in their blood. I first recognized this was a
serious health hazard when I wrote the law to ban the use of lead
in new drinking water systems.
   ``Now I think we should ban the sale of leaded gasoline
immediately. What do you think? Should we?''
   Viewers are invited to call an 800-number to register support or
opposition to the proposed ban by pushing the appropriate number on
their phone. Opponents and supporters alike are asked to leave
mailing information on the tape if they want a brochure on lead
poisoning.
   GOP political consultant Jim Weber called the ad a ``smart
tactic'' that allows the incumbent senator to make a smooth
transition into campaign activity.
   The ad could attract support from ``ticket splitters and middle
of the road folks,'' Weber said.
   ``It's an interactive measure which to me is quite clever,''
said Democratic consultant Peter Hart.
   Bradley aides said the ad was not designed with fundraising in
mind. The senator is heavily favored for re-election and has raised
more than $10.1 million.
   ``We have no plans to use this information to generate money,''
said campaign spokesman Bob McHugh. ``What this is about is
protecting kids in New Jersey.''
   Bradley's GOP opponent, Christine Todd Whitman, called the ad
and accompanying brochure a self-promotional gimmick.
   ``Bill Bradley's attempt to promote awareness of this issue is
sleight of hand at best and manipulation at its worst,'' she said.

   The gathering and message at Mitch Snyder's
funeral were like those that marked his life _ a mass of homeless
people with a few celebrities sprinkled in, all getting a hefty
dose of social gospel.
   ``Mitch loved the poor with an unquenchable and sustained
fire,'' antiwar priest Phillip Berrigan said Tuesday of the
militant advocate for the homeless. ``Now all of us must do as
Mitch did, work to end injustice.''
   Snyder, 46, was found hanged last week in the shelter he helped
create, an apparent suicide. A note found nearby spoke of problems
in his relationship with his longtime companion, Carol Fennelly.
   But the celebrities, politicians and activists who remembered
him before 3,000 people at a tearful two-hour, outdoor funeral
chose to concentrate on his commitment to the downtrodden and his
political activism.
   ``He found people to be beautiful and worthwhile that everybody
else seems to have written off,'' said singer-actress Cher, who
spent several holidays serving food at feasts for the homeless
organized by Snyder. ``It must truly be, `Love thy neighbor as
thyself,' and ... Mitch lived that.''
   ``He leaves us here to tell the story that America's dream is
incomplete,'' civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said in a eulogy.
`Until the hungry are fed and the homeless are housed. ... we will
not surrender _ the work continues.''
   Snyder was cremated after the services outside his 1,200-bed
shelter and a protest march to Washington's city hall behind the
horse-drawn carriage bearing his casket.
   His remains will be kept inside the shelter along with the ashes
of homeless people, many of them anonymous, who died on the streets
of the capitals.
   At the government building, Snyder's followers from the
Community for Creative Non-Violence blocked doors to protest the
city council's decision last month to scale back a law guaranteeing
shelter to all who need it. Thirty-seven people were charged with
unlawful entry and released without bail, police said.
   Snyder ``was a politician, he lived it, he dressed it,'' said
Fennelly, his companion and shelter co-founder. ``For those of you
here today who are a little uncomfortable with the political aspect
... that was Mitch.''
   Speakers at the service played down Snyder's personal problems.
   ``How he died ... really does not matter,'' Jackson said. ``How
he lived is all that matters. He left on his terms, an authentic
suffering servant.''
   ``We get weak sometimes and we blame it on our friends, the ones
we love,'' said comedian and social activist Dick Gregory. ``Every
now and then, us men get weak moments. Sometimes we make it through
and sometimes we don't.''
   Mayor Marion Barry, often the target of Snyder's criticism over
spending on the homeless, said, ``Some try to figure out how Mitch
died, why Mitch died. I'd rather concentrate on how Mitch lived.''
   Actor Martin Sheen, who played Snyder in a television movie
about Snyder's 1984 hunger strike that gained the downtown shelter
building, said Snyder ``embodied one of the favorite sayings of
Robert Kennedy: That one man with courage is a majority.''

   Summit leaders struggled to break a deadlock in a
U.S.-European fight over billions of dollars in farm subsidies with
indications early Wednesday morning that negotiators were closing
in on a possible agreement.
   Officials close to the negotiations, who spoke on conditition
that they not be named, said the language being discussed would
provide for cuts in farm subsidies in each of the three areas
singled out by the United States.
   The language being considered would call for ``substantial,
progressive reductions'' in subsidies in the areas of export
subsidies, internal price supports and barriers to imports.
   The United States had insisted that all three areas be covered
in an agreement, a position that had been opposed by the European
Community.
   However, the draft language also made reference to the European
Community's more general approach which would measure a country's
total trade subsidies and then work to reduce that level, thus
giving each side bargaining space in upcoming talks later this
month in Geneva.
   One source said that while this was the language being
considered for inclusion in the final communique to be read by
President Bush later Wednesday, negotiators had by no means
resolved the issue.
   ``They are going through the proposal line by line,'' the source
said. ``There is still much time left in the evening.''
   Before the trade negotiators began their late night discussions,
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it was uncertain
whether the United States would achieve its goal of language
committing countries to across-the-board reductions.
   ``The farm subsidy question is still an open one,'' Fitzwater
said.
   The dispute over farm subsidies and to a lesser extent
discussion over Soviet aid required the leaders to spend an extra
90 minutes in their afternoon meeting. In addition to Bush, leaders
from Britain, Japan, West Germany, Canada, France, Italy and a
representative from the European Community were participating in
the talks.
   If the economic summit fails to achieve strong language on the
farm subsidy issue, it would be a significant setback for the Bush
administration, which sees resolution of the issue as critical to
getting global trade talks back on track.
   While the United States for three years has been trying to get a
commitment to eliminate the $245 billion rich countries spend to
subsidize farmers, the European Community has been opposed,
contending that 3 million of its farmers could lose their jobs.
   The 12 nations of the EC have a total of 10 million farmers
compared with 2 million in the United States.
   The European Community has insisted that it was willing to
reduce the aggregate total of farm subsidies, but did not want to
commit to cutbacks in each separate area sought by the United
States.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher submitted a compromise
proposal in an effort to bridge the gap but it was rejected by the
United States as unacceptable, officials said, even though it
attracted considerable support from other European countries.
   Britain, which has few small-scale farmers, is the most willing
of the Europeans to compromise with the United States and sought to
mediate in the summit talks.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said the delegations would
continue discussing the farm dispute late into the night. He
described the debate on agriculture as a ``vigorous discussion''
among all the countries involved.
   President Bush's battle to eliminate farm subsidies worldwide
over the next decade had appeared to receive a boost on Monday when
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl signaled his willingness to
accept a U.S.-backed proposal as a starting point for negotiations.
   U.S. officials expressed hope that remaining differences could
be resolved so that the summit countries would be able to give
guidance to their trade negotiators in Geneva.
   Resolving the farm question is seen as critical to successful
completion of a nearly four-year effort to overhaul the global
trading system. That effort, known as the Uruguay Round for the
country where the talks were launched, is being conducted by the
97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The United States, which has posted six consecutive years of
trade deficits topping $100 billion, has a lot riding on the effort.
   By removing trade barriers, the administration believes a new
GATT pact would greatly expand export opportunities for American
businesses and farmers, thus lowering the U.S. trade deficit.
   The basis for possible compromise in Houston revolved around a
recent outline for a final agreement issued by Aart de Zeeuw of the
Netherlands, the chairman of the GATT agricultural negotiating
group. That proposal calls for significant reductions in subsidies
for exports, in domestic support payments to farmers and the
removal of barriers to agricultural imports.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed support for the de
Zeeuw proposal on Monday, giving hope to the Americans that they
might be able to convince other European countries to compromise on
the issue.
   But European Community officials, who have been lobbied hard by
Americans in Houston, said that while Kohl's comments were
significant they did not mean that the other 11 EC countries would
go along. The issue of what position to take was certain to be
discussed next Monday at a meeting of the community's foreign
ministers in Brussels.
   Bush had declared that the trade issue was his top priority
going into the annual economic summit and he argued the point
forcefully during private one-on-one meetings as well as the group
sessions with his summit partners.
   The administration pressed the point that the best thing the
world's richest countries could do for the developing world was
expand trade opportunities, especially in agriculture, the chief
export in most of the developing world.
   Developing countries now lose billions of dollars in sales each
year because of $245 billion being spent annually to subsidize
farmers by rich countries. U.S. subsidies cost taxpayers and
consumers $75 billion annually.
   The administration believes it can persuade Congress to
eliminate the farm supports over time if other countries do so as
well since U.S. farmers are among the most efficient in the world.
   Congress is currently considering a 1990 farm bill which would
continue America's farm subsidies.
   Asked Tuesday if lawmakers might be willing to cut the subsidies
if the Houston summit reaches agreement on the issue, House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said, ``It is unlikely that Congress
would develop a farm program based on some future circumstance that
has certainly not yet arrived or not expected to arrive.''

   FBI Director William S. Sessions took his wife
on 17 business trips aboard government aircraft but she paid for
only one flight, according to a congressional study.
   The General Accounting Office said its survey of trips aboard
government aircraft by Sessions and Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh underscores the need for a travel policy covering
federal officials and their spouses.
   ``We continue to believe that a government-wide policy is needed
to clarify under what circumstances spouses should be permitted to
accompany government officials to official functions aboard
government aircraft,'' said the GAO report issued Tuesday.
   The study of 39 trips aboard government aircraft by Thornburgh
and 36 by Sessions between Aug. 11, 1988, and July 31, 1989, was
requested by Rep. Bob Wise, D-W.Va.
   It found that Alice Sessions accompanied her husband on 17 trips
to such destinations as San Francisco, New Orleans, Key West, Fla.,
and Williamsburg, Va.
   FBI spokesman Robert Davenport said Mrs. Sessions did not pay
for the flights, except one, because her husband was traveling on
official business. Mrs. Sessions paid $280 for one flight when the
couple extended a trip to take care of personal business in San
Antonio, Texas, Davenport said.
   Thornburgh's wife, Ginny, accompanied her husband on six
official trips during the period surveyed. In April, five months
after the GAO began its inquiry, Thornburgh reimbursed the Justice
Department $2,128 to cover the six trips plus two others she took
on government aircraft.
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said Mrs. Thornburgh
was not required to pay for her flights, but did so out of ``an
abundance of caution.''
   Thornburgh also paid the government $1,032 to cover personal
trips that he and his family took aboard the aircraft, which were
seized from convicted criminals.
   GAO did not question the propriety of the trips but said the
government should examine its travel policy to determine when it is
appropriate for officials to take their spouses on official
business.
   The government should consider ``what constitutes an `official
purpose' or `official function''' and when it's appropriate for
spouses to fly for free, GAO said.
   In a letter to the Justice Department, Wise criticized the
agency for its failure to adopt a travel policy after it had
assured him last fall that one was being drafted.
   Eramian said a policy will be adopted, adding: ``It would have
been silly to put something together until we saw what the GAO
recommendations were.''
   The GAO also said the Justice Department failed to compare the
cost of using the seized aircraft to transport Sessions and
Thornburgh with the cost of leasing private aircraft.
   The watchdog arm of Congress acknowledged that the Justice
Department had legitimate concerns about the security of Thornburgh
and Sessions.
   But GAO said ``our analysis indicates that private aircraft
services available through lease, charter, or rental arrangements
could satisfy the principal security and related concerns better
than regularly scheduled airlines.''
   The Justice Department did its own analysis after the GAO study
began and concluded that it was saving $500,000 a year by using
seized aircraft instead of leasing commercial planes.
   ``If we had leased an aircraft and spent an extra half million a
year, we would have received a larger dose of criticism,'' Eramian
said.

   A record-setting fraud settlement by a major
government contractor means a $2.7 million windfall for the
helicopter company employee who blew the whistle.
   Robert C. Ballew, 43, of Fort Worth, Texas, sounded like a
lottery winner after the Justice Department announced Tuesday that
Textron Lycoming agreed to pay the government $17.9 million.
   The settlement is the largest ever reached under the Justice
Department's ``whistleblower'' lawsuit program.
   The payment to the government, which has already been made,
settles a fraud investigation focusing on the Stratford,
Conn.-based company's problem-plagued Coast Guard helicopter
engines. It translates into a $2.7 million windfall for Ballew _ 15
percent of the total.
   ``I think anybody would be happy to have the money,'' Ballew
said. ``I've still got a lot of bills to pay, kids to send to
school; I could sure use the money.''
   Ballew was a procurement official with Aerospatiale Helicopter
Corp., a French firm that makes the Coast Guard's Dolphin
helicopter, when the problems with the engines turned up. He said
he decided to sue in May 1988 when he became concerned that he
could be jailed because of the chronic engine problems. It was a
decision that cost him his job.
   ``We tried to get the problem cured where I worked,'' he said.
``It seems like they couldn't do enough. When that happened it put
me in risk of going to jail.''
   Textron was under investigation for providing engines that
failed to meet their operating specifications and for fraudulently
billing the Coast Guard for repair work, according to the Justice
Department. The twin-engine helicopters are used in
search-and-rescue and drug interdiction missions.
   Former Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost once referred to the
engine as ``a lemon.''
   A separate investigation by the National Transportation Safety
Board turned up 154 ``failures'' of the LTS-101 engine,
manufactured by Textron's Lycoming Williamsport, Pa., plant. An
NTSB computer list indicated that at least 11 deaths may have been
directly related to engine failure, and published reports have
placed the estimate as high as 14.
   The Justice Department's ``whistleblower'' lawsuit program
encourages individuals with inside information to sue when fraud or
other abuses appear likely. If the evidence is promising, as it was
in this case, the government then takes over the case and
guarantees the whistleblower a percentage of any settlement.
   Ballew sued both Textron and his own company. Aerospatiale later
was dropped from the investigation for lack of evidence, according
to the Justice Department.
   Investigators said Textron supplied the Coast Guard an engine
that was in the shop after an average of only 600 hours of flying
time. Specifications called for the engine to put in 2,400 hours in
the air between overhauls.
   Textron issued a statement admitting no wrongdoing but saying it
planned to provide a thorough maintenance program and already had
made improvements in the engine.
   Textron also agreed to maintain the engines and supply parts for
the next six years and be paid a fee based on the engine flying
time. That provision could save the Coast Guard an estimated $60
million, according to the Justice Department.
   Ballew said he was laid off after filing the suit and has found
another job in the aerospace industry. He declined to name his new
employer.
   Does Ballew have plans to spend his fortune?
   ``What I intend to do is quietly sit at home with my wife and
kids,'' he said. The settlement, he said, ``says that maybe my
judgment wasn't flawed. That what I saw, what I have been trained
to check for and ask questions about, was right.''

   Senate employees would get comprehensive
guarantees against job discrimination for the first time under a
measure approved by the Senate as it launched its debate on a major
civil rights bill.
   But the plan added to the bill Tuesday would stop short of
allowing Senate employees to go to court for enforcement of their
rights, prompting complaints that it was out of keeping with the
spirit of civil rights.
   ``It's an appeal to the worst of plantation mentality on Capitol
Hill,'' Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa., said in urging a stronger
version.
   Senate employees have traditionally been exempted from
fair-hiring and other civil rights guarantees.
   The Senate itself would handle civil rights complaints from its
employees under the plan, sponsored by Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky. But
it would guarantee them rights under three laws passed over the
last 25 years and two currently pending, including the bill now
under debate.
   Provisions of the bill _ which tops the congressional agenda of
civil rights forces _ range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to a prohibition against discriminatory seniority systems.
   The Bush administration, however, has been sharply critical of a
provision that would force employers either to end discriminatory
practices or prove in court that they were justified by business
necessity.
   The provision would effectively negate a Supreme Court ruling
last year in a case involving hiring practices at a salmon cannery
in Alaska. The court held that anyone filing such a suit must prove
that the discriminatory practice in question was not a business
necessity.
   Critics of the bill say its so-called ``disparate impact''
provisions responding to the ruling would prompt employers to use
racial and ethnic hiring quotas to head off lawsuits.
   Administration officials and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
the bill's chief sponsor, have been searching for a compromise that
would spare President Bush having to veto a civil rights bill and
give supporters some of their goals.
   The negotiations have turned into a fight over shadings of legal
definitions, and no visible progress was made Tuesday.
   White House chief of staff John H. Sununu said in a letter to
Kennedy: ``Basically, I continue to fear language that causes more
problems than it solves, or language with unintended consequences
that would stimulate a quota-based defensive position.''
   Kennedy issued a statement saying that ``negotiations are
continuing but so far the administration's proposals have not been
satisfactory.''
   ``Last year's decisions by the Supreme Court have seriously
jeopardized the right of millions of women and minorities to equal
job opportunity,'' he said. ``Congress should restore the full
strength of the antidiscrimination law, not restore them only part
way.''
   Earlier, Kennedy unveiled a fresh compromise proposal, saying it
``is a mockery of civil rights ... for opponents of this
legislation to raise the false hue and cry of quotas.''
   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said the plan would ``force
business people to proportionately hire, just to save their skins''
and avoid lawsuits.
   The latest round of modifications were refinements of highly
technical language in the bill. For example, the revised version
would force those filing suits to single out specific objectionable
practices rather than target groups of practices.
   The new version would change the definition of business
necessity from ``essential'' to effective job performance to
``bears a substantial and demonstrable relationship'' to effective
job performance.

<HEAD>Study: By 1991, AIDS Fifth Leading Cause of Death Among Young
Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   AIDS is rapidly rising through the ranks of
killers of American women of childbearing age and by next year will
probably be the fifth leading cause of death among them, scientists
reported today.
   The AIDS death rate is dramatically higher among young black
women than whites, and the disease is far more prevalent in the
Northeast than in other regions, the scientists said in the Journal
of the American Medical Association.
   AIDS already claims more black women ages 15 to 44 in New York
state and New Jersey than any other health problem, wrote the
researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   ``We've known how serious the problem is in New Jersey,''
Christine Grand, deputy state health commissioner, said by
telephone Tuesday from Trenton. ``However, even those working in
the field are shocked to see how high the standing is vis-a-vis all
causes of death.''
   Nationwide, among women ages 15 to 44, deaths from AIDS soared
from 18 in 1980 to 1,430 in 1988, the most recent year for which
statistics are available, the researchers said.
   The death rate quadrupled between 1985 and 1988, when AIDS
accounted for 3 percent of all deaths of women in that age group,
the researchers said.
   The report elaborates on CDC findings released in November
indicating AIDS had become the eighth leading cause of death among
American women of childbearing age.
   Among all U.S. women ages 15 to 44, the leading causes of death
are, in order: cancer, injuries, heart disease, homicide, suicide,
strokes and related diseases, liver disease, AIDS, diabetes, flu
and pneumonia.
   ``If current trends continue, AIDS can be expected to become one
of the five leading causes of death by 1991'' among women of
childbearing age, the researchers said.
   Because women who have the AIDS virus are the major source of
infection for infants, the trends portend disaster for thousands of
children, CDC researchers wrote.
   ``As the number of pediatric cases increases, the medical and
social costs will be staggering,'' the report said. Each baby born
in poverty who is infected with the virus costs Medicaid $18,000 to
$42,000 annually, it said.
   The disease killed 40.7 black women per 100,000 in New Jersey
and 29.5 per 100,000 in New York in 1987, the most recent year for
which regional statistics are available, said lead author Susan Y.
Chu, a CDC epidemiologist.
   ``That to me is remarkable, because it exceeds the rates of
heart disease and cancer, as well as accidents,'' she said by
telephone from Atlanta.
   Among all women, the AIDS death rates were 9.4 per 100,000 in
New Jersey and 9.3 per 100,000 in New York. Nationally, the death
rate for black women _ 10.3 per 100,000 _ was nine times the death
rate for white women, the researchers said.
   Regionally, women in the Northeast overall died of AIDS at a
rate of 5.3 per 100,000 population, 26 times the rate in the
Midwest, the researchers said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   Three-quarters of women with AIDS-virus infections get them from
using intravenous drugs or having sex with intravenous drug users,
Ms. Chu said.
   In 1989, there were 2,825 new cases of AIDS among women of
reproductive age, the researchers said.
   Dr. Howard Minkoff, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at
the State University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn,
said the findings are overwhelming and worrisome.
   Even more troubling, he said in a telephone interview, is the
attitude of white, middle-class Americans whose reaction to such
reports is, ``It's still not us.''
   Minkoff said 2,000 women infected with the AIDS virus will bear
infected babies in the United States this year.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador Returning to Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last U.S. ambassador to Cambodia,
John Gunther Dean, said today he plans to return to Phnom Penh to
help heal the wounds of 20 years of conflict.
   Dean, now retired from government service, was ambassador when
the Khmer Rouge defeated the U.S.-backed Phnom Penh government in
1975. Vietnam drop the Khmer Rouge from power in late 1978 and
installed a pro-Hanoi regime.
   Clutching an American flag, Dean and his staff were evacuated by
helicopters April 12, 1975 as the Khmer Rouge closed in on the
capital.
   Dean, who is to fly to Phnom Penh on Thursday and stay about a
week, said he would try to arrange a Thai educational exchange and
look into the possibility of hotel construction by an Indian
company to promote tourism.
   ``What I can do is to help Cambodia and the people of Cambodia
find ways to bring them out of isolation and into cooperation with
the rest of the world,'' Dean said in an interview.
   ``I believe that the time of healing of wounds from 20 years of
conflict should be seized,'' he said.
   Fighting continues between the government of Prime Minister Hun
Sen and a three-member guerrilla group that includes the Khmer
Rouge, who are supported by China. The two other non-communist
groups are backed by the United States.
   Dean said he was making the trip on behalf of the Bangkok-based
Asian Institute of Technology, a highly regarded international
institution which trains Asian students in a variety of scientific
and technical fields.
   Following the 1975 Khmer Rouge victory, Cambodia's educated
class was virtually eradicated by the ultra-radical communists.
   The United States has no diplomatic ties with the Vietnam-backed
Phnom Penh government and Americans are barred from doing business
in the country.
   During Khmer Rouge rule, hundreds of thousands of Cambodia's 8
million people died from executions, famine and civil unrest.
   Dean favored a negotiated settlement of the 1970-75 war and
clashed with then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on U.S. policy
towards Cambodia.
   He later served as ambassador to Denmark, Lebanon, Thailand and
India. Dean currently resides in France and Switzerland.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Red Cross disputes a report that
it improperly failed to report on AIDS cases possibly transmitted
through blood transfusions and federal authorities acknowledge
there is no such reporting requirement.
   Red Cross spokesman Bud Good responded Tuesday in a prepared
statement to a report that the Red Cross failed to notify federal
authorities about 228 cases in which patients may have gotten AIDS
through contaminated blood transfusions.
   ``The Red Cross has not failed to comply with FDA requirements
to report transfusion-associated AIDS cases for the simple reason
that there are no such requirements,'' Good said.
   A low-level FDA report on an inspection of Red Cross' national
headquarters in Washington between April 26 and May 25 found that
none of the cases had been reported to the agency ``as required.''
   But top FDA officials acknowledged Tuesday that the inspection
report, which was disclosed in Tuesday's editions of The
Philadelphia Inquirer, was incorrect and that there is no federal
requirement for the Red Cross to report possible
transfusion-related AIDS cases to the FDA.
   Physicians are supposed to report AIDS cases to the federal
Centers of Disease Control.
   The lower-level FDA inspection report that started the flap said
the Red Cross lacks procedures for reviewing and tracking
transfusion associated AIDS cases.
   FDA headquarters said in a statement late in the day that the
agency ``will pursue these matters and work to remedy any
problems'' raised by the inspection report.
   However, the FDA said it had reviewed about 50 of the most
recent 228 cases of possible transfusion-related AIDS and found
that nearly all involved transfusions before AIDS antibody testing
began in 1985.
   ``In the course of the inspection, there was no evidence that
any blood that tested positive after 1985 was improperly
released,'' the FDA said.
   The FDA also said that past record-keeping problems of the Red
Cross ``do not show an imminent hazard to the blood supply.''

   A television reporter who spent two weeks in
jail for refusing to reveal a confidential source says he will
return to the police beat a more informed journalist.
   Brian Karem was freed Tuesday after the source released him from
his vow of confidentiality.
   ``The First Amendment is first for a reason,'' Karem said.
``It's been an eye-opener.''
   Karem, 29, who works for KMOL-TV, was held in contempt of court
and sentenced to six months in jail for refusing to identify who
helped him obtain a telephone interview last year with jailed
murder defendant Henry David Hernandez, who told Karem he shot
police officer Gary Williams in self defense in March 1989.
   Attorneys in the case said they needed to know who arranged the
interview to determine whether it was admissible as evidence.
   Hernandez is charged with his brother, Julian, in the shooting.
   Karem lost two U.S. Supreme Court bids to remain free while he
appealed the contempt-of-court citation.
   Karem testified Tuesday that his confidential source is Deborah
Ledesma, a cousin of the Hernandez brothers. Ms. Ledesma on Monday
night released Karem from his promise of confidentiality, which he
said he made because the woman feared Hernandez family members.
   State District Judge Pat Priest sent Karem to jail but released
him after Karem handed over notes identifying Ms. Ledesma.
   Karem, KMOL-TV officials and their attorney, Larry Macon, said
lawyers in the Hernandez case were using Karem.
   ``We've maintained from the beginning that this was unnecessary
and the information was readily available to investigators if they
just asked. They didn't need to use a reporter as the investigative
tool,'' KMOL-TV news director Ron Harig said.
   Beth Taylor, an assistant district attorney, said it was
necessary to pinpoint Karem's contact and said his not revealing
the name was ``a waste of time.''
   Asked what was most difficult about jail, Karem joked, ``wearing
the Bexar County underwear. I tell you, that's not fun.''
   Karem, who planned to take off the rest of the week and spend it
with his wife Pam, 29, and their 18-month-old son Zachary, said he
would go through the experience again to keep a promise to a source.
   ``I didn't intend to prove anything. I just intended to keep my
promise, so I kept my promise,'' Karem said.
   Karem said support from fellow journalists helped keep his
spirits high when he was in jail.
   ``I can't even describe all the emotions I had when I saw the
support that I got,'' he said.
   A graduate of the University of Missouri journalism school,
Karem became a reporter in 1982. He went to work for KMOL-TV in
1988 after working for newspapers and television stations in the
Midwest and Texas.

<HEAD>Picnic Cooker Hoses Recalled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A manufacturer of outdoor picnic equipment is
recalling hoses for 30,000 smoker-cookers because of possible fire
hazards.
   The Coleman Co., Inc. is recalling hoses that connect propane
gas tanks of its ``Cookin' Machines'' to the burner because they
may loosen from the valve connection after repeated use, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday.
   There have been at least five reported incidents of loosened
hoses causing fire damage, said the CPSC.
   The potentially hazardous hoses are installed on cookers
manufactured by the Kansas-based company between November 1987 and
March 1989.
   Consumers should discontinue use of the cookers immediately and
contact Coleman at 1-800-835-3278 for instructions on free
replacement of the hoses.

   A coalition of consumer, health and insurance
groups says more federal leadership and money are needed to help
prevent 600,000 deaths that result each year from consumer products.
   In releasing a status report Tuesday, the Coalition for Consumer
Health &amp; Safety said 80 percent, or more than 480,000, of those
deaths involved cigarettes and alcohol.
   Among the findings:
   _47,093 people were killed in motor vehicle accidents in 1988,
an increase of 1.5 percent from 1987 when 46,390 died on the
nation's roadways and a 0.6 percent rise from the previous year's
toll of 46,087.
   _Falls were the leading cause of fatal accidents in the home,
accounting for 6,500 deaths in 1988. Fires were the second-ranked
cause, followed by suffocation, poisoning, firearms and drownings.
   _Cardiovascular disease, one of the key factors for which is
diet, killed nearly 1 million Americans in 1987, while nutritional
deficiencies caused a reported 2,890 deaths in the United States
that year.
   _Cigarette smoking was responsible for 390,000 deaths in the
United States in 1985. Between 1965 and 1987, the proportion of
American adults who smoked dropped by 40 percent for men and 21
percent for women. About 49 million Americans still smoke
cigarettes.
   _Alcohol was involved in 90,991 deaths in 1986, up from 88,935
the previous year.

<HEAD>Rural Alaskans Depend on Firefighting for Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK BAUMGARTNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's peak wildfire season in Alaska,
but that's not necessarily a bad thing for some remote villages
where jobs are scarce.
   ``In some villages, firefighting is the single most important
source of income in a year,'' said Pete Buist, spokesman for a
Fairbanks fire station.
   More than 200 wildfires have ravaged a half-million acres of
interior Alaska this fire season, which began in late June and
could run into September.
   ``There's no economy in the villages,'' said Ron Silas, a former
firefighter. ``Fires are quick income. It's cash that supplements
hunting and fishing.''
   Alaska has more than 70 firefighting crews with 16 members each,
most from villages. The firefighters go through at least three days
of training to learn such things as how to operate a chain saw,
work a water pump and build fire lines.
   ``Some years, they don't all get to work. But this year
everybody who wants to is working,'' Buist said.
   The federal government calls fire crews to work. Those who have
been out of work the longest are called first, he said. Crews from
outside Alaska are called only when needed.
   About 2,500 firefighters from across the United States were on
fire lines in Alaska on Tuesday.
   ``A work crew can earn $2,500 a day or more. They take that
money right home to the local economy,'' said Russ Davis, who
represents one of several federal firefighting teams flown to
Alaska to help with a 41,000-acre fire that threatened the town of
Tok, 275 miles northeast of Anchorage.
   Firefighters earn $11.43 an hour and work as many as 16 hours a
day for up to three weeks at a time, Davis said. Crews are provided
sleeping bags and meals at state and federal expense.
   Permanent jobs in rural Alaska are scarce, said Frank Starbuck,
a fire crew leader from the Inupiat Eskimo village of Selawik, a
village of 680 residents just above the Arctic Circle 375 miles
northwest of Fairbanks.
   ``Firefighting is very important to Selawik. Most guys depend on
it during the summer,'' Starbuck said.
   He led one of two Selawik crews that spent five days this week
fighting a blaze at Pedro Dome, about 15 miles north of Fairbanks.
The fire charred 900 acres before it was brought under control
Monday night.
   For many rural Alaskans, fire is a mixed blessing.
   ``I hate to see everything burn up _ the timber and the
wildlife. They have their young ones now and I feel bad about
that,'' said Molly Galbreath, an Athabaskan Indian from the eastern
interior village of Mentasta. ``That's where we get our food.''
   But before the fire, Galbreath, 57, had a hard time finding
work. She now earns $9 an hour helping out at the Bureau of Land
Management's fire station in Tok.
   ``This will really help for the long winter,'' she said.

<HEAD>Mandatory Death Sentence For Traffickers Has Not Proved A
Deterrent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior police official says the
mandatory death sentence for convicted drug traffickers, made law
six years ago, has not deterred smugglers and that such sentences
should be carried out more quickly.
   Despite the harsh penalty, the number of people arrested for
drug trafficking has instead risen, a newspaper quoted acting
Senior Assistant Commissioner Mohamed Said Awang as saying.
   ``The people who undertake these suicide tasks (drug
trafficking) are only mercenaries, who are easily replaced,'' the
New Straits Times quoted him as telling a conference on drug
treatment.
   The impact of the mandatory death sentence on the traffickers
has been diluted because of those arrested only a few have been
convicted, said Mohamed.
   Of the 3,340 people detained under that law since 1983 only
1,130 were charged in court. Of these, only 197 were found guilty,
he said.
   Other government officials have said that since 1975, when a law
was enacted specifying life imprisonment or the death sentence for
convicted traffickers, 340 were sentenced to death and 112 of them
hanged.
   The others are awaiting appeals or execution dates.
   In 1983, the law was changed by parliament to death sentence
only.
   Mohamed said that to make that law more effective hanging should
be carried out as soon as possible.
   He said there is a current lapse of between two and six years
from sentencing to execution.

   Douglas was in the middle of a newspaper interview last week
when an intercom in his 16th-floor hotel suite came alive.
   ``Remain calm and stay where you are,'' came the repeated
warning over the intercom.
   ``Sure,'' Douglas told his interviewer from the Chicago Tribune.
``Remain calm. The ladders are outside the windows, don't look

   It turned out to be a false alarm.
   ``I didn't plan this drama, you know,'' he said.

   It's a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde kind of story,
with a musical twist.
   When the sun goes down, two physicians, a nurse and a former
receptionist turn into the rock 'n' roll band Dr. Mark and the
Sutures.
   Several times a year, the Sutures go out in their hospital-green
scrub suits and play their favorite Beatles tunes. They donate
their performances for charitable causes.
   ``Doctors and rock music _ it's like wearing tennis shoes with a
tuxedo,'' said band founder Dr. Mark Hill.
   ``There's not a great amount of levity in medicine. So when
patients see us in this role, they're shocked,'' said the surgeon
from suburban Highland Park.
   It's a mission that started on a lark.
   Three years ago Hill agreed to come up with entertainment for a
neighborhood block party. Hill, who paid his way through medical
school working as a musician, called on a fellow doctor at Highland
Park Hospital, a patient and others he knew who also had music as a
hobby.
   For backup singers, they eventually added a nurse from the
hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department, a former
receptionist from Hill's office and a couple of friends from
outside the medical community.
   Hill, 39, plays guitar and keyboard, and Dr. Ricky Katz, a
34-year-old internist, plays guitar. The backup singers are nurse
Patricia Handler, 32, and 27-year-old Vickie Tarbis, the former
receptionist who since has become an airline stewardess.
   ``We meant this as a joke,'' Hill said. ``But there was a huge,
huge crowd at the block party. People started coming up to me and
calling me and asking me to do shows.''
   The Sutures have played performances to raise money for a
nursery school, organizations that help the handicapped and other
community groups.
   ``We're seven people who have lives with our families and have
professional careers, which take number one priority,'' Hill said.
``But we do this because we enjoy music and because we can help out
for worthy causes. And that makes everyone feel good.''

   Children as young as 3 years old were found
working in violation of child-labor laws, the U.S. Department of
Labor said.
   The department said Tuesday it had documented 238 cases of
minors working illegally in Northern California, including one
3-year-old and two 4-year-olds found working in an onion field near
Fresno during a June 6 sweep.
   The children were putting yellow onions in a bucket after their
parents had cut off the tops, the department said in a statement.
   The operator of a labor service was fined $1,200 for four
violations of child-labor laws, the department said. The parents
and farm owner were not cited.
   Investigators from the department's Wage and Hour Division found
most of the 238 alleged violations during a March 12-14 sting and
in follow-up investigations. Most of the violations were in
fast-food restaurants. The employers were fined almost $75,000.

   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen
Wednesday, while share prices rose moderately.
   The dollar closed at 148.10 yen, down 1.50 yen from Tuesday's
close of 149.60 yen. It opened at 148.42 yen, the lowest opening
since Feb. 27, and ranged between 147.65 yen and 148.75 yen.
   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average for 225 selected issues
gained 141.75 points, or 0.44 percent, closing at 32,294.18. The
index shed 385.85 points the previous day.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was low on a decline
overnight in New York and renewed speculation that the Bank of
Japan would soon raise its discount rate.
   The yen firmed after a Washington-based investment advisory firm
Smick Medley International predicted Japan's central bank would
raise its key rate for loans to commercial banks within the next
few months.
   Japan's discount rate now stands at 5.25 percent, one of the
lowest among industrialized nations. The country has been under
pressure from its major trading partners to move quicker to lift
the rate.
   The higher rates banks must pay to depositors make it more
expensive for them to acquire funds for lending and investment.
   Foreign exchange dealers in New York said the forecast forced
down the dollar's exchange rate against the Japanese currency.
   Daiwa Bank's Sumio Fukushima said there was little chance that
Japan's central bank raise the discount rate in the near future,
``but in the long term, it's a strong possibility.''
   Expectations of a statement in the Houston conference of seven
industrialized nations favoring a stronger yen were still weighing
down the dollar, other dealers said.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the surge of the yen against
the dollar and solid Japanese bond prices encouraged buying and
pushed the share prices up.
   The price of the No. 119 10-year Japanese government bond stood
at 86.78 points, up from Tuesday's close of 86.74. The yield stood
at 7.240 percent, down from 7.250 the previous day.

   A defiant Andrew Dice Clay tossed off
criticism that his comedy is racist and sexist, tearfully telling
Arsenio Hall's audience that his foul-mouthed routine is a deep
expression of belief in himself.
   Clay appeared on ``The Arsenio Hall Show'' Tuesday night to
promote his new film, ``The Adventures of Ford Fairlane.'' He faced
a walkout by a member of the sydicated television talk show's band
and blunt questions from Hall about his brand of shock-comic
routine.
   Keyboardist Starr Parodi said she exercised her right to
disagree with Clay's humor by not performing during the show. Clay
shrugged off the boycott, saying ``People do what they got to do.''
   Then, squaring his shoulders like Elvis Presley, Clay suddenly
broke into tears as he faced the studio audience.
   He said his routine was the product of long, hard work to
discover what is funny and true.
   ``I broke my ass for 12 years ... and tomorrow, when they go to

voice cracking with emotion.
   ``If you want to be a doctor, or if you want to be a lawyer, you
don't listen to nobody and you believe in yourself. That's what
it's all about.''
   Clay is known for expletive-laden routines that contain vulgar
references to women, homosexuals and minorities. But he said he is
misunderstood by critics, including many fellow entertainers, who
say his brand of humor is offensive and hateful.
   He said his ethnic put-down style is ``just a joke.''
   ``This is the greatest country in the world,'' he added. ``We

<TEXT>
   Government officials today expressed satisfaction
at the recognition of Asian issues during the Houston economic
summit. One press report found a ``Japanese wind'' blowing at the
annual gathering.
   Though the biggest political issues at the summit were how the
West should react to the rapid changes in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu had been determined to
also focus on Asian problems.
   Aid to China was a major component of the summit political
declaration issued Tuesday. The document also cites moves to
political openness in Mongolia and Nepal and praises the
Philippines government for struggling to uphold democracy.
   A separate statement read in Houston by Secretary of State James
A. Baker III was especially gratifying to the Japanese government
because it mentioned Japan's 45-year-old territorial dispute with
the Soviet Union.
   It also sought to encourage dialogue between North Korea and
South Korea and expressed concern about North Korea's failure to
accept international safeguards aimed at preventing the spread of
nuclear weapons.
   A Foreign Ministry official said Japan appreciated the first
mention in a summit statement of Tokyo's demand for the Soviets to
return a group of islands in the Kuril chain off northern Japan.
   ``We hope the Soviet Union will appreciate the weight attached
to this message,'' said the official, briefing reporters on
condition of anonymity.
   The liberal-leaning Asahi Shimbun newspaper said in a commentary
that Japan had stood alone at the summit in recommending the
resumption of loans to China and in bringing up the territorial
dispute in the context of the debate over aid to the Soviets.
   ``The leaders from each country must have sensed a sort of
`Japanese wind,' with Japan taking a clearly different stance from
the other countries and Kaifu announcing that Japan would provide
large amounts of aid'' to China, the Asahi commentary said.
   Kaifu was a first-time participant in the summit with the
leaders of the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Canada
and Italy. But he has gone further and more directly than his
predecessors in speaking out on the need for Japan to exert
political influence in line with its economic power.
   Japan's economy is second in size only to the U.S. economy, and
its role as the world's biggest creditor nation is increasingly
recognized as important if financial power is to be used to
encourage the spread of Western democracy and free-market economies.
   But Japan rejects European proposals to give economic aid to the
Soviets _ citing the unresolved territorial problem _ and was alone
in deciding to aid China. Other summit participants said China
hadn't done enough yet in the human rights area to win an end to
sanctions imposed after the brutal crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement in June 1989.
   Japan plans to resume a previously frozen program of $5.2
billion in loans to China over five years.
   Japanese commercial bankers also plan to consider resuming
substantial loans to China ``in a positive manner,'' Taizo Hashida,
chairman of the Federation of Bankers' Association of Japan, said
at a news conference.
   The summit went on debating trade issues, with some Japanese
media noting that the name of the the conference site _ Rice
University _ could focus attention on Japan's ban on rice imports.
   A cartoon in the Asahi showed a cowboy Kaifu riding a bucking
bronco and shouting ``Rice, Rice'' as the other government heads
watched his ``one-man rodeo.''
   President Bush is urging a phaseout of barriers and subsidies to
agricultural trade worldwide that would force Japan to end its ban
on imported rice. Japan argues that it already imports half the
food needs for its 123 million people, and it's a matter of
national security to remain self-sufficient in the staple food.

<TEXT>
   Gov. John Ashcroft got his kicks by
riding in a 1961 Corvette and signing legislation designating a
307-mile stretch of nostalgic Route 66 in Missouri as a historic
highway.
   ``Route 66 was never an ordinary road. From the time it was
commissioned in 1926, it was something special to those who drove
it and those living along it,'' Ashcroft said at a bill-signing
ceremony Tuesday making Missouri the first state to give Route 66
historic status.
   U.S. 66, known as ``America's Main Street,'' was made famous by
the 1960s television show ``Route 66'' and the song of the same
name performed by the Rolling Stones.
   The narrow, concrete ribbon also helped fuel booming Southern
California by carrying thousands of job-seeking Midwesterners to
the West.
   The highway stretched 2,400 miles across eight states from
Chicago to Santa Monica, Calif. But the federal interstate system
doomed Route 66, and the last portions of the highway were erased
from the nation's road maps in 1984.

   Thousands of people were imprisoned, tortured and
killed last year by governments seeking to suppress conflicts
arising from ethnic tensions or nationalist yearnings, Amnesty
International said today
   The human rights group also criticized the executions of 16
people in the United States in 1989, and U.S. court rulings that
permit the death penalty for teen-agers or retarded people
convicted of murder.
   In its annual world survey of human rights, the London-based
organization said repressive measures in many cases served to
entrench bitter conflicts and dimmed prospects for dialogue.
   ``Peaceful protesters in many countries were arbitrarily
arrested in vast numbers. Many were held for months without charge
or trial. In countless cases, state torture was the price citizens
paid for being identified as sympathizers with ethnic or
nationalist movements,'' it said.
   ``Around the world, particularly where the tensions erupted into
violence, tens of thousands of people became victims of security
operations resulting in `disappearances' and extrajudicial
executions,'' it added.
   The nearly 300-page survey said ethnic and nationalist groups
have been suppressed in Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Sri Lanka, India,
Burma, Indonesia, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, China, Chad,
Mauritania, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Bulgaria, Guatemala and
Brazil.
   In Eastern Europe, it said, new governments have emptied their
prisons of dissidents, but it said dissenters are still harshly
treated in Albania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.
   On a positive note, Amnesty noted the release of political
prisoners in Benin, Ethiopia, Somalia, South Africa and Namibia,
and significant reductions in executions in South Africa and
Nigeria.
   The report cited ``disturbing'' U.S. Supreme Court rulings
permitting the execution of offenders who are mentally retarded or
as young as 16.
   With 16 executions last year, the United States carried out more
legal death sentences than any other country in the hemisphere by
Amnesty's count. Cuba executed four, Guyana executed one and
Antigua and Barbuda executed one.
   Amnesty says it opposes the death penalty ``under all
circumstances.''
   The report highlighted these instances of ethnic or nationalist
tensions being met by government repression:
   _ Thousands of Sri Lankans were reported to have ``disappeared''
or were summarily executed by government troops and paramilitary
allies combating an armed Tamil rebellion.
   _ In Somalia, 46 members of the Issaq clan, including children,
reportedly were murdered by government soldiers in July. Similar
reprisals were reported against members of the Ogadeni clan after a
rebellion by Ogadeni soldiers.
   _ Forty-two members of the Dinka and Nuber communities in Sudan
reportedly were summarily executed in October, and members of the
Dinka, Nuber, Nuer and Shilluk communities have suffered gross
human rights violations ``solely because of their ethnic origin.''
   _ Twenty people were killed when Soviet troops broke up a
peaceful demonstration in Tbilisi, Georgia in April, and police and
troops assaulted an unarmed crowd of about 1,000 people in the
western Ukraine in October.
   _ An unknown number of Tibetans were killed and more than 1,000
arrested when Chinese troops broke up an independence demonstration
in Tibet in March 1989 and imposed martial law. Amnesty said there
were many reports of torture involving beatings, electric shocks
and hanging by the arms.
   _ Israeli troops shot to death more than 260 unarmed
Palestinians in the occupied territories, and 13,000 Palestinians
were held in prisons or detention camps.
   _ Kurds have been subject to brutal treatment in Iraq, Iran and
Turkey, the report said. Seven Kurds who surrendered to Iraqi
authorities during an amnesty in February were executed, the report
said, and Kurds were victims of a wave of secret executions in Iran
that ended in January 1989.
   The report challenged the tactics used against the Irish
Republican Army's armed campaign to drive Britain out of Northern
Ireland. Amnesty renewed its demand for judicial inquiries into
several killings of IRA suspects by British security forces,
claiming they were not adequately investigated.

<HEAD>Dollar Dives, Stocks Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar plunged to a 4{-month low against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo today, while the yen's rise gave a moderate
boost to prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 148.10 yen, down 1.50 yen from Tuesday's
finish of 149.60 yen. It was the lowest closing since 146.47 yen on
Feb. 23. The dollar now has fallen 2.90 yen in the last four
trading days.
   After opening at 148.42 yen, the dollar ranged between 147.65
yen and 148.75 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average for 225 selected issues gained 141.75
points, or 0.44 percent, closing at 32,294.18. The index dropped
385.85 points on Tuesday.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar's plunge followed a
decline overnight in New York and renewed speculation over an
increase in Japan's official discount rate.
   The yen firmed after a Washington-based investment advisory
company, Smick Medley International, predicted that Japan's central
bank would raise its key rate for loans to commercial banks within
the next few months.
   Bank of Japan officials declined to comment on the prediction.
   Japan's discount rate now stands at 5.25 percent, one of the
lowest among industrialized nations. The country has been under
pressure from its trading partners to raise the rate to stem the
yen's weakness against the dollar and other major currencies.
   Higher interest rates tend to make a currency more attractive to
investors.
   Daiwa Bank's Sumio Fukushima said there was little chance that
the Bank of Japan would raise the discount rate in the near future.
``But in the long term, it's a strong possibility,'' he said.
   Spot transactions totaled $19.591 billion, up from Tuesday's
$14.668 billion.
   On the stock market, dealers said the yen's surge and solid
Japanese bond prices encouraged buying of shares that have dropped
to attractively low prices.
   However, they said, many institutional investors sat on the
sidelines amid uncertainty over currency and interest rates.
   ``If interest rates go higher, the big investors could be
discouraged about risking their money in stocks,`` said Yoshiro
Inoue of Nomura Securities.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 400 million shares,
up from a thin 350 million shares the previous day.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds stood at 86.90 points as of 5 p.m., up
from Tuesday's close of 86.74. The yield stood at 7.215 percent,
down from 7.250 the previous day.

<TEXT>
   Japan's largest underworld organization has offered
more than $67,000 to the relatives of a man apparently killed by
mistake in a gang war, one of the syndicate's lawyers said today.
   Two men opened fire June 29 on an apartment in Osaka, western
Japan, where a leader of the Hadani gang, a rival of the mammoth
Yamaguchi-gumi, had lived until just two weeks earlier.
   The gunfire killed Akira Yamashita, a 66-year-old telephone
company employee who had moved into the apartment with his wife.
   It was the second death attributed to the Yamaguchi-gumi's
battle with the Hadani gang, which began when a Hadani gangster
allegedly shot a Yamaguchi-gumi member to death in the western
Japan city of Fukuoka on June 28.
   Police believe the shooting was to avenge a ``turf violation.''
   Both gangs are based in the Osaka area. Police say the
Yamaguchi-gumi has 22,000 members in about 800 affiliated gangs
across the country, while the Hadani gang has an estimated 220
members.
   ``It is very hard to imagine that Mr. Yamashita was not killed
by Yamaguchi-gumi members or their affiliates,'' said Yukio
Yamanouchi, one of the Yamaguchi-gumi's lawyers.
   Yamanouchi, contacted by telephone, told The Associated Press
that on the day after the killing, he was told by a Yamaguchi-gumi
``executive'' to take a briefcase containing 10 million yen
($67,500) to the home of Yamashita's widow and offer it as a
condolence.
   ``But before I could explain, her son closed the door in my
face,'' Yamanouchi said.
   Because many shootings have occurred in daylight and in crowded
areas, the gang war has received heavy media coverage and aroused
strong police concern.
   Police also see the conflict as part of the continued expansion
of the Yamaguchi-gumi, which has more than doubled its membership
since 1986 by forcing rivals to either join its ranks or wage
costly and bloody turf battles.
   The National Police Agency estimates that one in every four
gangsters in Japan is now affiliated with the Yamaguchi-gumi, whose
main sources of income are believed to be illegal gambling,
extortion and drugs.
   Though Japan prides itself on its low crime rates and strict
gun-control laws, police fear the Yamaguchi-gumi's growth will make
gangland shootouts an increasingly serious problem.
   ``We are being very cautious, and have seen no indication that
the conflict will end soon,'' said an Osaka police official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. He said 14 gang-related shootings
occurred in Osaka alone in the past two weeks.
   Thirteen Yamaguchi-gumi members were arrested last Friday after
Osaka police raided 62 Yamaguchi-gumi offices and homes. No one has
yet been charged in Yamashita's murder, however.

   With the smack of a sake bottle, Japanese
shipbuilders today christened the world's first ship that will use
superconductivity to push itself through the water.
   The high-tech ship, christened the Yamato No. 1, is a public and
privately funded experimental vessel shaped roughly like a
streamlined telephone.
   The ship's developers said they view the vessel as a prototype
for high-speed seacraft. It will use electromagnetic force instead
of a conventional screw propeller to thrust itself through the
water.
   The main purpose of the project, however, is to demonstrate that
superconductivity could be used to power a ship, they said.
   ``This ship has been developed without regard to cost. It's
experimental,'' said Jutaro Namba, a coordinator at Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries in Kobe, a major port in western Japan about 270
miles west of Tokyo.
   The 185-ton ship is 100 feet long and about 35 feet wide.
   It is drydocked in the Kobe shipyard of Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, Japan's largest shipbuilder and a member of a
consortium developing the ship's new technology.
   Superconductivity is expected to make the use of electricity
much more efficient, reducing the need for fossil fuels. It is
being developed for use in computers and their components, in
magnetically levitated high-speed trains, electric cars and other
devices.
   Superconducting coils made of niobium and titanium in thrusters
underneath the ship are used to create a magnetic field that is
repulsed by an electric current carried in water circulating
through the thrusters. The repulsion produces the same kind of
force used to propel superconducting trains on land.
   Engineers who worked on the ship say a combination of helium gas
and liquid nitrogen is used to cool the coils to minus 452.47
degrees Fahrenheit. At that temperature, electricity passes through
the coils without resistance.
   The use of water-propelled thrusters instead of conventional
rotating screw propellers is expected to minimize maintenance
problems as well as noise and vibration.
   The vessel also is energy-efficient. Most of the space on board
the ship is occupied, however, by diesel-engine generators used to
provide an electric current for the thrusters, for pumps and for
on-board equipment, the engineers said.
   The ship's main handicap at present is its speed, a mere 8
knots, compared with about 40 knots for fast hydroplanes. And to
minimize its weight, it has space for only about 10 people.
   Experts say new materials are needed to produce a strong enough
magnetic field to propel the ship at commercially viable speeds.
   Officials say sea trials will be held next spring after the ship
is fitted with thrusters and other seagoing equipment. A smaller
model of the ship first was successfully tested in 1987.
   The vessel is the brainchild of a consortium of companies,
universities and government researchers led by the Japan Foundation
for Shipbuilding Advancement, with funding from the Ministry of
Transport.

<HEAD>New NEA Definition of Obscenity Same as Supreme Court Standard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts has adopted
the U.S. Supreme Court's definition of obscenity in deciding what
works to fund.
   The new NEA guidelines on obscenity, released Tuesday, appear to
offer a much more vague standard than a previous definition of
obscenity imposed on the NEA by Congress last fall.
   Lawyer Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment specialist representing
the New School for Social Research in a lawsuit challenging the
obscenity restrictions, said the Supreme Court standard ``is a
possibly useful step forward, but certainly a confusing one, since
the NEA seems to continue to insist that the original language be
sworn to.''
   In a letter to the U.S. attorney's office sent Tuesday, Abrams
asked whether the Supreme Court definition may be substituted for
the Congress-imposed definition when artists sign contracts
accepting NEA grants.
   Abrams also asked that NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer be made
available for a deposition July 18 to answer questions about how
the new guidelines should be interpreted.
   Alan Taffet, the U.S. attorney representing the NEA against
Abrams, said the federal agency will ask that the complaint be
dismissed.
   The NEA's moves follows its denial of grants to four performance
artists whose work has a strong sexual content.
   The definition of obscenity imposed by Congress last fall barred
the NEA from funding work that in the NEA's judgment ``may be
considered obscene, including ... depictions of sadomasochism,
homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children, or individuals
engaged in sex acts and which, when taken as a whole, do not have
serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.''
   But NEA spokesman Josh Dare said under the new definition,
``Whether or not a photograph is homoerotic and obscene, for
example, will be determined based on the standard set forth by the
Supreme Court.''
   That standard defines as obscene any work that the average
person, applying contemporary community standards, would find
appeals to prurient interest; that depicts sexual conduct in a
patently offensive way; and that, on the whole, lacks serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
   The New School filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court
challenging the constitutionality of the obscenity guidelines in
connection with a $45,000 grant to build a sculpture garden.
   Abrams said that if the NEA had offered the Supreme Court
definition to begin with, rather than the Congress-imposed
definition, ``Certainly there would have been much less controversy
and less concern that people were being asked to sign away their
First Amendment rights. Now we have a situation of some confusion.''
   The anti-obscenity campaign was spearheaded by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C. His office did not return a call for comment.

   A 23-year-old Spaniard was badly gored
today in the fifth running of the bulls of the San Fermin festival,
which Ernest Hemingway made famous.
   Doctors at Navarre Hospital said Juan Manuel Garcia received a
deep wound in his left thigh and a skull fracture after being
tossed in the air by one of the six bulls that made the morning run
from the corrals to the city bull ring.
   He was listed in serious condition.
   Three other Spaniards were treated at area hospitals, including
a 17-year-old with a broken wrist, while 27 other people received
first aid at one of the emergency stations set up along the
mile-long route.
   The morning runs are the focal point of the weeklong revelry.
Dozens of runners, mostly young men, test their bravery by running
ahead of and alongside the bulls, which are later killed in the
day's bullfight.
   The annual festival attracts thousands of tourists from around
the world. It was the setting for Hemingway's 1926 novel, ``The Sun
Also Rises.''
   Not counting interruptions due to wars, the festival has been
held continuously since 1591. Since that date bulls have gored to
death 52 people, according to municipal records.

   A judge ordered a county hospital to
pay $121,030 to the mother of a 2-year-old who died of AIDS
contracted through a blood transfusion in 1983.
   ``I feel relieved. I feel peace of mind, and I feel that my baby
is finally at rest,'' Belinda Jackson said. ``I hate to see anybody
go through what my baby and myself went through.''
   Ms. Jackson sued the hospital district after learning her
daughter, Tristainne Omega Louise, contracted the AIDS virus
through one of eight transfusions she received at the hospital
after a premature birth. The girl died in 1985.
   In a decision released Tuesday, state District Judge William
Hughes found no negligence in the blood-testing methods of the John
Peter Smith Hospital's blood bank in 1983, but did find negligence
in the way it screened blood donors.
   Lowell Dushman, Ms. Jackson's attorney, said it is the first
court victory nationally in an AIDS-by-transfusion case that
occurred before there was general knowledge about the disease,
which appeared in 1981. The virus that causes it was discovered in
1983.
   ``We feel every time one of these can be won, it breaks down the
tremendous fortress of defense the blood banks have built,''
Dushman said.
   Assistant District Attorney Sullivan Bradley, who represented
the hospital, argued that no screening test for AIDS was available
when the child received transfusions in 1983.
   ``It is fair to say the industry is concerned about having
today's knowledge and today's standards imposed on what it should
have been doing. We're talking seven years ago,'' he said.
   Hughes said the hospital's screening process to eliminate
intravenous drug users as donors in 1983 ``fell below the standard
of care to accomplish that objective.''
   The judge said evidence showed that ``well prior to 1983,
hepatitis B was known to be a sometimes-fatal disease transmitted
by intravenous drug users.''
   The blood given to the child was contaminated with the human
immunodeficiency virus, which causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   One of the donors, identified only as Donor X during last
month's trial, was an intravenous drug user who testified in a
deposition that hospital employees did not ask about drug use
before accepting his blood.

<HEAD>Iraq Urges Increase of OPEC Oil, Wants To Coordinate With Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONA ZIADE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said today that it is willing to
cooperate with its former foe, Iran, to boost prices of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' oil to at least $25
per barrel.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted an unidentified official
at the Oil Ministry as saying Baghdad believes raising OPEC's
benchmark price could easily be achieved if all 13 member states
adhere to production quotas.
   The agency said the official was reacting to a statement earlier
this week from Tehran that higher oil prices was the only
``tangible'' common grounds between Iran and Iraq and should be
exploited in the search for a settlement of their 10-year-old
political dispute.
   The INA report, monitored in Nicosia, came as Iraq's Oil
Minister Issam al-Chalabi was in Jiddah for a meeting of five gulf
Arab OPEC heavyweights. The aim of the meeting hosted by Saudi Oil
Minister Hisham Nazer was to coordinate policy ahead of an OPEC
meeting set for July 25 in Geneva.
   ``Iraq is seriously calling for increasing prices to $25 per
barrel as soon as possible,'' the official said.
   ``This can be achieved through adhering to the set quotas and
avoiding violations and gluts until prices eventually reach $30 per
barrel,'' the official said.
   At its last meeting in December, OPEC set a total output ceiling
of 21.086 million barrels a day in an effort to defend an $18
benchmark price.
   But recently, prices dropped to $14 dollars per barrel. That was
attributed to a glut on the oil market caused by the violation of
production quotas by some OPEC members.
   The chief culprits for overproduction are Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates.
   The Oil Ministry official told INA that ``overproduction by
Kuwait and the U.A.E caused fragmentation'' within the 13-member
OPEC cartel.
   The official said even if a $30-dollar price is acheived, OPEC
members should keep working to increase crude prices under a
strategy that ``would not allow any alternative energy source to
compete with oil.''

<HEAD>Cost of Space-Station Maintenance Reportedly Sky High</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new NASA report concludes that the planned $37
billion space station will require nearly 75 percent more
maintenance than earlier predicted, a newspaper reported today.
   The conclusion prompted the space agency to set up a special
team to search for ways to reduce maintenance of the 500-foot-long
station, The New York Times said.
   The newspaper quoted NASA engineers it did not identify by name
as saying the station, intended as a centerpiece for study of the
solar system by spacewalking astronauts, must be redesigned.
   ``You can't do it as currently designed,'' one of the engineers
was quoted as saying. ``You have to build a different station.''
   He said political pressure was on to downplay the problem.
   ``There's a lot of pressure to make this problem not a
problem,'' he said.
   Neither the new maintenance estimate from an earlier team of
experts nor the result of the search for solutions has been made
public. Both may be released next week, the newspaper said.
   The space station would need more than 3,800 hours of
maintenance by astronauts each year, the newspaper said.
Preliminary findings in March by the earlier team said the station
would require about 2,200 hours of maintenance each year.
   The special team was put together in June at Johnson Space
Center in Houston to mount a crash search for design changes and
other possible solutions, but some on that team expressed doubt
Tuesday that significant progress can be made.
   ``The numbers suggest the station cannot be built,'' the Times
quoted a Johnson Space Center engineer as saying.
   The space agency hoped to begin building the station in the
mid-1990s. The station would have a life span of 30 years.
   Billie A. Deason, a Johnson Space Center spokeswoman, said NASA
will have no comment on either the new maintenance estimate or the
search for solutions until all findings are made public.
   NASA already is under fire for a serious defect in the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope, hobbled by a mirror defect, and
fuel leaks that have grounded the $25 billion space shuttle fleet.
   Possible solutions to the space station maintenance problem
include improvements to increase the lifetimes of parts, combining
several repair tasks at one time and having advanced robots make
repairs.

   Rain fell early today over the nation's mid-section, where a
clash of cool air from the north and tropical winds from the south
was expected to spawn violent thunderstorms.
   Dry weather prevailed in the West early today, but the region
was expected to suffer record heat. Temperatures were likely to
soar into the mid-90s in the Rockies and past 100 degrees in the
desert Southwest.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered today across the South.
Thunderstorms struck Southern Florida, central Georgia and along
the Mississippi River at St. Louis.
   Rain fell early today at Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis and
other parts of the Midwest.
   There was a thunderstorm at Pittsburgh and rain along the Maine
coastline.
   The Plains had mostly dry weather, but thunderstorms were
expected to develop later.
   The stationary front of the cool northern air and warm tropical
winds was to stretch from Maryland along the southern Ohio Valley
and Midwest to the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles. Heavy
thunderstorms were like along the front.
   Showers and thunderstorms were expected along the Texas and
Louisiana coasts.
   The Northeast was likely to be dry with seasonable temperatures.
   The nation's high on Tuesday was 110 degrees at Red Bluff, Calif.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady in Calm Trading, Gold Slightly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was steady in calm European trading
late this morning as the market's attention focused on the American
currency's weakness against the Japanese yen.
   Gold drifted slightly lower in modest dealings, traders said.
   The yen got a boost after Japanese authorities indicated they
might be willing to raise interest rates, dealers said.
   The Japanese currency is also expected to get some support from
the meeting of the seven major industrialized nations in Houston,
Texas which ends Wednesday.
   ``My impression is that the yen has finished its decline,'' one
analyst in Milan said. ``It might not have a sudden boom, but I
don't think it's going to keep losing.''
   The dollar was reported stalled in its tracks, although traders
said they think it still could move lower.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar plunged to a 4{-month low against the yen. It dropped
1.50 yen to a closing 148.10 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted
at a fractionally higher rate of 148.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6447 West German marks, down from 1.6465
   _1.3930 Swiss francs, down from 1.3945
   _5.5210 French francs, down from 5.5270
   _1.8523 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8555
   _1,205.50 Italian lire, down from 1,207.00
   _1.1586 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1570
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.8082, compared with $1.8155 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $353.50 an ounce, down
from $353.75 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $353.70.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $353.60, down from $353.90 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.89 to close at a bid $355.02.
   Silver was selling in London at a bid price of $4.82 an ounce,
unchanged from Tuesday's late bid.

<HEAD>Astronaut Suspension Called `Wrist Slapping' by New Commander</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air Force Col. Fred Gregory has reluctantly
accepted his new space shuttle command after a fellow astronaut was
grounded for disciplinary reasons.
   ``This is a very difficult and emotional time for us. We know
that,'' Gregory said Tuesday. ``It's like a mother spanking her
child and says this is going to hurt me more than you. It's a bad
experience. But these people are mature enough and the group is
mature enough to keep striving forward.''
   Gregory won a shuttle command slot Monday after NASA grounded
Navy Capt. David M. Walker. Walker, 46, was suspended for 60 days
for infractions that included an incident last year in which the
T-38 he was flying came within 100 feet of a Pan Am jetliner in a
near-collision outside Washington.
   NASA also announced Monday that Navy Cmdr. Robert L. ``Hoot''
Gibson was pulled from shuttle flight assignments and barred for a
year from making T-38 jet trainer flights for violating a policy
that restricts high-risk recreational activities. Gibson was
involved in a fatal plane crash at an air show during the weekend.
   ``Both Dave Walker and Hoot Gibson are terrific pilots, but this
is just a temporary activity and basically it's a wrist slapping,''
said Gregory, who said he has not talked with Walker or Gibson
since the action was taken. ``Sometimes we have to do it to get
somebody's attention.''
   A man answering the telephone at Walker's house Tuesday said he
was unavailable for comment. Gibson has an unlisted number.
   Gregory, with 7,000 hours of time flying high-performance
aircraft, will replace Walker on a Department of Defense flight
scheduled for March 1991. He has flown twice before in space, most
recently as commander of a Defense Department mission launched last
November.
   No replacement was named immediately for Gibson.
   Gregory said he was unaware of his being named to the upcoming
flight until two minutes before an astronaut meeting Monday morning.
   ``I didn't know, absolutely not,'' Gregory said. ``I was
shocked. People were wandering around and congratulating me on
getting another command, but it's one of these you take with great
reluctance.''

<HEAD>Tons of Potato Products Tainted With Wire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL ANN RIHA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of tons of french fries, hash
browns and potato puffs destined for fast-food chains were
impounded by a food processing company after pieces of wire were
found in them.
   Metal-laden potato products mysteriously began appearing at
Lamb-Weston Inc.'s Hermiston plant June 4, said Steven Johnson, the
plant's former quality assurance manager.
   ``It looks like wire from a wire brush that you use to scrape
paint off or something,'' Johnson said in a telephone interview.
``And we found this wire embedded in the french fry after it had
been processed. These wires had kicked off the metal detectors.''
   The potatoes were being processed for fast food restaurants in
the U.S. and Japan, but none ever reached consumers, according to a
state Agriculture Department official.
   Most of the impounded potato products never left the plant, but
were stored in a refrigerated warehouse, The Wall Street Journal
reported. The paper said about 100 cases of hash browns were sent
to McDonald's distribution centers, but were located and returned
unused to the plant.
   At Lamb-Weston's parent company, ConAgra of Omaha, Neb.,
spokesman Walt Casey said Lamb-Weston impounded the potatoes,
``they notified the FDA, and they worked with the FDA in resolving
the problem.''
   But a state official said the Oregon manufacturer of the spiked
spuds failed to notify state inspectors of the problem.
   James Black, administrator of the food and dairy division of the
state Agriculture Department, said the only notification was an
anonymous tip to a state field assistant on vacation in the
Hermiston area.
   Black said the state Agriculture Department is responsible for
inspecting plants in the state. He said the federal Food and Drug
Administration doesn't get involved unless the product is shipped
out of state.
   Johnson said at least 18 million pounds of potato products were
affected between June 4 and June 27, when he was fired.
   ``We run close to a million pounds a day,'' he said. ``It was a
lot of metal in a lot of french fries. ... We had 30 cases of metal
kicked off on the metal detectors.''
   Johnson said he discovered the wire June 15 and tried to track
the source until he and six other employees were fired because of
the problem. He did not elaborate on the firings and the company
refused to discuss them.
   Black said he did not know whether plant officials had isolated
the source of the problem. Johnson said he initially thought a wire
brush might have been caught in a water pump feeding the flume, a
water-filled chute that moves the potatoes into the processing area
from the receiving area, but none was found.

<HEAD>As Many As 23 Killed in Four Days of Riots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 23 people have been killed in
four days of clashes between riot police and stone-throwing mobs
demanding the end of one-party rule, a newspaper reported today.
   The English-language Daily Nation said the five new deaths had
all occurred Tuesday in Kiambu district, a region about 15 miles
west of Nairobi.
   Dozens more people also were injured by gunfire and beatings and
1,040 were charged in courts in Nairobi and Nakuru with looting and
rioting, the newspaper reported. The country appeared calm today.
   The Daily Nation said police shot dead four people in
Githunguri, a town in the district, on Tuesday after rioters tried
to force students to join them in building roadblocks. The paper
said a 6-year-old girl was killed in the district's Muchatha
village after being hit by a stray bullet.
   The government said that as of Tuesday morning, 15 people had
been killed and 61 injured in the violence. But at least three of
10 deaths confirmed independently prior to the official tally were
not included in the government breakdown. The independent tally,
including the deaths reported in today's Daily Nation, was 23.
   President Daniel arap Moi on Tuesday blamed the violence on
``hooligans and drug addicts.''
   The clashes followed last week's detentions of Kenya's most
prominent supporters of multiparty democracy. They began Saturday,
when police used tear gas and guns to disperse demonstrators in
Kenya's capital.
   By Monday, the violence had spread to outlying cities and rural
areas.
   Kenya has long been considered one of Africa's most stable and
successful nations. Since early this year, however, Moi has come
under increasing pressure to allow a multiparty system.
   But he has insisted that to do so would lead to ethnic divisions
and even warfare in Kenya.
   One prominent lawyer under threat of arrest for his criticism of
the government, Paul Muite, has gone into hiding since last week's
seizures and another, human rights lawyer Gibson Kamau Kuria, has
sought refuge at the U.S. Embassy.
   On Monday, Kenya issued a strong statement condemning the U.S.
decision to give Kuria asylum, and also accused the United States
of fueling the pro-democracy movement.
   The United States protested the charge in a meeting between
Herman Cohen, assistant secretary for African affairs, and Kenya's
ambassador in Washington, Denis Afande.
   On Tuesday morning, two large artillery guns were parked for a
time across the street from the U.S. ambassador's residence.
   The U.S. State Department has advised its citizens to delay all
non-essential travel to Kenya.

   Tens of thousands of miners struck the
Soviet Union's coal fields today in a 24-hour walkout aimed at
crushing Communist Party power and forcing the government to quit.
   The walkout in western Siberia, the Ukraine's Donetsk region and
the Soviet Far North falls on the anniversary of a protracted
strike last summer _ the worst Soviet labor unrest in 72 years.
   Last year's strike brought the coal industry to a standstill and
crippled factories before the government promised the strikers
improved living conditions and a greater saying in the management
of their workplaces.
   The miners say authorities have failed to keep their promises,
and say they'll form an independent union next month. President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev would be the first Soviet leader since
Vladimir Lenin to face such a union.
   ``They promise us everything. Our personal lives are worse than
they were a year ago, especially housing and food,'' lamented
Alexander Zuyevsky, 40, who works in the October Mine in Donetsk.
   The strikes come a day after Gorbachev was re-elected party
chief by the Communist Party's 28th Congress.
   Addressing the congress today, Gorbachev said his information
indicated the walkout was not a general strike. He said
participation in western Siberia was minimal.
   ``We feel more understanding from the side of the miners,'' he
said.
   Strike organizers say the walkout affected about 200 of the 250
mines in the eastern Ukraine's Donetsk basin, the Soviet Union's
largest coal field.
   They claimed that about 300,000 miners would halt work in westen
Siberia alone. But organizers in the coal basins could not provide
any firm figures on the number of miners who actually participated.
   Some miners have already taken tough action against the long
dominant but now discredited Communists, whom they blame for
failing to solve the country's chronic economic problems.
   Workers at the Kalinin and Panfilovsky shafts in the Donetsk
voted this week to evict party representatives from mine offices.
   Alexander Tupikin, a strike organizer at the Panfilovsky mine,
said the Communists should not be allowed special access so they
don't ``pressure the working class, which we've had for the 72
years of Soviet power.''
   At today's Donetsk rally, the mood of the crowd was angry.
Speakers stood on steps in front of the party and government
headquarters. Miners attending the rally fashioned hats out of
newspapers to shield them from the sun.
   ``From 10 years old, I was against the party, but only a few
years ago were we allowed to speak about that,'' Andrei Voronits, a
former miner from the region, said in an interview. He added that
his main demand was Ukrainian independence but that he also
supported demands for better living conditions.
   About 100 policemen kept order at the rally, and there were no
disturbances.
   At a pep rally Tuesday night, strike organizer Yevgeny Moiseyev
told about 150 miners: ``I will call for putting the party on
trial. I ask you to support me in that.''
   A red banner with the slogan ``Put the Communist Party on
Trial'' hung in the hall of the October Mine, where the rally was
held.
   On a bulletin board in the hall, a hand-written notice calling
for the resignation of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov was posted
next to official notices about mine activities.
   The miners went ahead with their walkout in defiance of appeals
by Gorbachev and the 28th Communist Party Congress under way in
Moscow.
   At the congress on Tuesday, a leader of last year's strike in
the Kemerovo region challenged Gorbachev in the election for party
leader.
   Gorbachev easily defeated the official, Teimuraz Avaliani, and
Solovyev said Avaliani's candidacy would damage his popularity
among miners highly critical of the Communist Party.
   Last summer's strike by miners was called to largely press
economic demands such as increasing supplies of meat, soap and
laundry detergent. But today's walkout was more political, with
miners demanding:
   _ that the Ryzhkov government resign;
   _ that Communist Party representation be eliminated at factories
and mines, in the KGB, the army and the police;
   _ that political education classes for children be eliminated;
and
   _ that party property be nationalized.
   Government and party leaders already have rejected the demands
and maintain they are doing all they can to improve working and
living conditions for miners.

<HEAD>Committee Says TV Coverage Of Commons A Success</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television coverage of the House of Commons, which
began as an experiment in November, has not increased rowdiness in
the chamber and should become permanent, a Commons committee said
in a report today.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and other critics had
originally opposed the introduction of TV cameras, saying they
feared for the reputation of the House because of frequent
boisterous behavior among legislators.
   But the all-party Select Committee on the Televising of
Proceedings of the House said in its report today that the TV
cameras had not affected the behavior of lawmakers.
   ``We believe we are justified in concluding that the experiment
should be judged a success,'' the committee said.
   The panel, which questioned legislators and broadcasters, added
that the experiment had met with a generally enthusiastic response
from millions of viewers.
   The 650-seat Commons, complete with speaker in traditional
horsehair wig, centuries-old ritual and legislators who bawl ``hear
hear'' and insults at each other, voted 318-264 in February 1988 to
let the experiment go ahead. Eight TV cameras began recording the
proceedings in the House on Nov. 21.
   The House appointed an independent company to supervise the
operation and sell the TV pictures to the British Broadcasting
Corp. and other broadcasters.
   The House ruled that when proceedings get rowdy, the cameras
must shun the disturbance and focus on the speaker, Bernard
Weatherill.
   The Commons is scheduled to vote on whether or not to accept the
committee's recommendation within the next two weeks. News reports
predicted it will accept the TV cameras on a permanent basis.
   The House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament,
has admitted the TV cameras since 1985. Radio broadcasting from the
Commons began in 1975, and newspaper reporters were first let into
the Commons in 1771.

<HEAD>White Actor in Asian Role on Broadway Stirs Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The choice of a white actor for the lead in the
play ``Miss Saigon'' has angered Asian-Americans who say the
Broadway role should go to an Asian.
   ``It's ridiculous to have a Caucasian actor with taped eyelids
play an Asian,'' Tony Award winner B.D. Wong told the Daily News
for a story published today.
   Jonathan Pryce, the actor chosen for the role of a Eurasian
pimp, also did the role in London, and received rave reviews and an
Olivier Award for his performance.
   ``Miss Saigon'' puts the ``Madame Butterfly'' tale of a military
man taking an Asian lover in a Vietnam War setting.
   ``I thought the yellowface days of Charlie Chan and Fu Manchu
were dead,'' playwright David Henry Hwang said, complaining about
the choice. Hwang won a Tony for ``M. Butterfly.''
   Scheduled to open on Broadway in April, ``Miss Saigon'' already
has $10.5 million in advance sales. The musical was written by the
team that created ``Les Miserables.''
   ``Personally, I think actors are actors, and shouldn't be
criticized for playing members of another race,'' said Geoffrey
Johnson, a casting director for ``Miss Saigon.''
   The Committee for Racial Equality of Actors' Equity met June 28
to discuss the controversy and Equity President Colleen Dewhurst
said, ``Everybody should be in an uproar ... because whoever does
this role will become a star.''
   Cameron Mackintosh, the show's producer, and Johnson said they
saw hundreds of auditions in San Francisco, Manila and New York but
were not able to find an Asian actor who fit the part.
   Wong, Hwang and other Asian-Americans are urging Mackintosh to
reconsider.

   Six pitchers pulled off a 2-0 shutout for the
American League in the 61st All-Star game.
   Manager Tony La Russa's toughest job Tuesday night was getting
up from his dugout seat to signal the bullpen.
   La Russa started Bob Welch then called for Dave Stieb, Bret
Saberhagen, Bobby Thigpen, Chuck Finley and Dennis Eckersley. Among
them they allowed only two hits.
   ``There wasn't much to swing at up there,'' La Russa said.
``They all pitched great.''
   The National League got singles to center field by Will Clark in
the first inning and Lenny Dykstra in the ninth. In between, there
were two walks, 16 consecutive outs and lots of raindrops. The
American League got seven hits.
   Julio Franco was selected the All-Star Most Valuable Player. He
hit a two-run double in the seventh inning off Rob Dibble.
   The game was delayed at the start 15 minutes by rain and again
in the seventh inning for 68 minutes.

<HEAD>Troops Overrun Rebel Camp, Find 20 Bodies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government troops overran a major
Tamil rebel camp in eastern Sri Lanka and found the bodies of 20
policemen believed to have been captured last month, military
officials said today.
   The camp, fortified with bunkers, land mines, booby traps and an
underground tunnel system, was captured Tuesday. There was no
resistance, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   They said at least 27 rebels and two soldiers were killed in the
five-day operation to capture the half-square-mile jungle camp at
Karijikudiaru in the eastern Ampara district.
   The 20 decomposed bodies found at the camp were probably of
policemen who were among the 850 captured by the rebels when they
overran a string of police stations along the east coast a month
ago, the officials said.
   Government troops have so far discovered about 300 bodies of
slain officers. Those who remain missing also are believed to have
been killed by the guerrillas.
   Last month's attacks broke a 13-month cease-fire in the
7-year-old Tamil rebellion. The guerrillas want independence for
the predominantly Tamil north and east from Sinhalese-dominated Sri
Lanka.
   The ethnic war started in 1983 with the rebels complaining of
discrimination by the Sinhalese majority in jobs, education and the
use of Sinhala language.
   Tamils account for 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
and the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population,
control the government and the military.
   More than 12,000 people have been killed in the rebellion; at
least 2,225 combatants have been killed since the latest fighting
started after a Tamil man complained to the rebels he was
manhandled by Sinhalese troops.
   On Tuesday, three soldiers were killed and eight wounded when
rebels attacked a military camp at Kokkavil village north of
Vavuniya, 135 miles north of Colombo, the military officials said.
   They said troops assisted by helicopter gunships replused the
assault, but that sporadic gunfire continued today.
   The rebels were reported to have suffered high casualties, but
the military officials said they did not have any details.
   Meanwhile, the government dispatched 12 trucks with food and
medicine today to the northern Jaffna peninsula where shortages are
growing acute.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today backed a top Ukrainian
official to be his Communist Party deputy in an election against
Yegor K. Ligachev, the candidate of traditionalists.
   Speaking to the Communist Party's Congress, the Soviet leader
threw his support behind Vladimir Ivashko, the 58-year-old
Ukrainian president and former party chief, for the post that will
assume responsibility for the party's day-to-day affairs.
   He expressed his confidence and closeness to the man he chose to
run the Ukraine, the Soviet Union's second-largest republic, last
fall when party traditionalist Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky retired.
   ``It is important that these two people be close,'' Gorbachev
said of the two top party leaders. On Tuesday Gorbachev was
overwhelmingly re-elected to lead the party, but he cannot devote
full attention to the job because he also is Soviet president.
   A third candidate, professor Anatoly Dudaryev, 45, of Leningrad,
proposed himself as a candidate. A vote was likely late today.
   ``As much as I have before, no matter what my job, I will be
working for perestroika,'' pledged Ivashko, an economist and
engineer by training. ``We have to do everything to renew the party
and change its priorities.''
   ``We have to understand that without us, without the party,
nothing will be left of perestroika,'' he said in a forceful
presentation to the delegates.
   The stout, white-haired Ligachev fought off a bid from the floor
to prevent him from running because of his age. Ligachev is 69, and
two efforts to require the deputy leader to be younger than 60, and
then 65, both failed.
   Ligachev, addressing the nearly 4,700 congress delegates, also
said he had worked well with Gorbachev.
   He stressed party unity in his speech, and in answer to
questions spoke out against allowing private property in the Soviet
Union.
   Ligachev said last month that one person could not handle both
the party leadership and the Soviet presidency, inferring that
Gorbachev should step down as party leader.
   But party traditionalists did not put up a candidate against
Gorbachev for the party leader's post, and he steamrolled his only
opposition, Teimuraz Avaliani, a local party official and coal
strike leader from western Siberia.
   Asked Tuesday why Ligachev did not run against Gorbachev for the
party leadership, Moscow party leader Yuri Prokofiev said: ``The
congress did not nominate him. That says it all.''
   In his brief acceptance speech late Tuesday, Gorbachev promised
to take ``the most serious, far-reaching conclusions'' from
strident criticism leveled at him during the congress.
   Earlier in the day, he ripped into his conservative critics.
   ``You can never go back to yesterday by any path, and no
dictatorship ... solves anything,'' he told the delegates. Some 40
percent of the delegates are party bureaucrats, and some continue
to run their districts as fiefdoms.
   ``If any of the delegates came to the congress with the hope of
returning the party to old conditions, comfortable or
uncomfortable, this is not a question,'' he said. ``They were
seriously mistaken.''
   Gorbachev and seven others were nominated for the top Communist
Party post. All but Avaliani, party leader in the Siberian city of
Kiselyovsk, withdrew.
   Avaliani, 58, also headed the strike committee in a protest for
higher pay and better working conditions in the Kuznetsk coal basin
last summer.
   His nomination came on the eve of a one-day political strike by
miners protesting the Communist Party's power and the government's
inability to fulfill the promises it made to end last year's
strike. Miners are calling for the resignation of Prime Minister
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and his Cabinet.
   Avaliani struck a moderate stance, saying he favored continued
government control of key enterprises. He said he would support
strikes only on a case-by-case basis.

<TEXT>
   The Syrian foreign minister said today
that Israeli air raids into Lebanon had complicated negotiations
for the release of one of 16 Western hostages held in that country
by Shiite Moslem extremists.
   In Lebanon, meanwhile, a senior Hezbollah official called for
the release of all Western hostages and of all Lebanese detainees
held by Israel. He reiterated the pro-Iranian group's standard
position that it is not involved in kidnappings.
   Hezbollah officials have often made such statements in their
effort to distance themselves from the kidnappings. But Western
intelligence sources insist Hezbollah is an umbrella for
underground factions holding most of the six American and 10
European hostages.
   Mohammed Yazbed, a member of Hezbollah's higher command, told
mourners in Baalbek today: ``We ask all those holding the hostages
and those holding our detainees as well to release them.
   ``We are against such operations (kidnappings), and support the
freedom of individuals,'' he said at the funeral of two Hezbollah
members killed in Israel's last air raid Monday.
   Farouk al-Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister, was the first
official to confirm a weekend report by the Iran's official news
agency that a hostage, most likely a European, might be freed soon.
Syria is the main power-broker in Lebanon.
   Sharaa said the raids Sunday and Monday against Hezbollah bases
in south Lebanon, which claimed at least 15 lives, had ``undermined
our efforts'' to secure the release of a hostage.
   The Syrians were instrumental in the release of American
hostages Robert Polhill on April 22 and Frank Reed April 30. Both
were freed in Lebanon and immediately whisked to neighboring Syria
for their freedom journey home.
   Syria maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate. They control Moslem regions as well as west
Beirut.
   Syria, Iran and allied Palestinian and Lebanese factions contend
that Western support of Israel encourages the Jewish state's
attacks against Arabs.
   Sharaa said he had no tangible developments to report, but it is
``not unlikely'' that that would change soon.
   He indirectly confirmed speculation in Beirut, London and Dublin
that the hostage to be released is Belfast native Brian Keenan.
   ``Syria is in constant contact with Iranian government officials
and we are also in contact with the Irish government,'' Sharaa said.
   `We are exerting efforts and we hope that these efforts will be
successful,'' he said.
   Asked when a release might take place, Sharaa said: ``I can't
tell you anything now.''
   He did not elaborate on the snags that followed the air raids,
but said: ``I hope we will overcome these difficulties.''
   Keenan, 39, was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut on April 11,
1986, as he walked from his home to the American University of
Beirut, where he taught English.
   In Beirut, Shiite sources said this week Iran was pushing hard
for the release of a hostage to express appreciation for relief
supplies it received from the West after the June 21 killer quake.
   Ireland had sent one of the first relief shipments to Tehran
after the disaster in which 40,000 people were killed, 60,000
injured and about half a million were left homeless.
   Irish Ambassador Declan Connolly said today: ``We continue to be
very hopeful'' about the possible release of Keenan,
   He spoke to reporters after a meeting at the Foreign Ministry
with one of Sharaa's senior aides, Nasser Qaddour.
   ``We talked about the possibility of a hostage release but at
this stage it would seem there have been no concrete
developments,'' Connolly said.
   ``I think we require a little patience,'' he added.
   Connolly, a non-resident ambassador, flew in from Saudi Arabia
on Tuesday. On arrival he said he was in Damascus to keep in closer
touch with Syrian officials to assess developments in a possible
hostage release.
   He said he had ``good reason'' to expect a release.
   Syrian sources and other Western ambassadors said they had no
concrete information to indicate the release of a hostage was
imminent.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani has been trying to end the
ordeal of the hostages in return for improved relations with the
West.
   But he is faced with growing opposition by Iranian radicals who
believe restoring ties with the West contradicts the teachings of
the late founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called pragmatist wing in the
Iranian hierarchy, argues that ending Iran's decade-long isolation
would lure foreign investment and technology and help the country's
war-battered economy.
   The longest held Western hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East corespondent for The Associated Press, who was abducted March
16, 1985.

   A fertility clinic agreed to pay up
to $6 million to a mother and three of her surviving septuplets to
settle a malpractice lawsuit.
   The fertility specialist who treated the woman, however, refused
to participate in the settlement and was dismissed as a defendant.
A court approved the settlement Tuesday, a day after jury selection
had begun.
   Patti Frustaci and her husband, Sam, contended Dr. Jaroslav
Marik and the Tyler Medical Clinic failed to properly monitor
fertility medication and perform tests that could have indicated
the potential for multiple births.
   Mrs. Frustaci delivered four boys and three girls in May 1985.
One baby was stillborn and three others died shortly after birth.
The surviving three have serious health problems, the couple say.
   The settlement was approved by Superior Court Judge David
Rothman.
   The clinic will pay $450,000 to the Frustacis immediately. The
three children also will receive monthly payments ranging from $400
to $1,000 until age 18. Then the monthly payments increase to
$1,000 to $3,000.
   Based on normal life expectancy, the payments could total up to
$6 million.
   ``I feel justice has been served in this case and I feel an
enormous sense of relief,'' said Mrs. Frustaci, 35, who also
announced that she was pregnant with twins, again by use of a
fertility drug.
   Marik, who had not commented publicly on the case, said Tuesday
that he was not to blame for the plight of the Frustaci septuplets.
He contended that Mrs. Frustaci did not follow his instructions in
her eagerness to become pregnant.
   As to who was at fault, he said: ``Why do you have to have
someone at fault? Sometimes these things just happen.''

<HEAD>North Before Iran-Contra Grand Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North made another appearance today
before a federal grand jury investigating the Iran-Contra affair.
   It is the former White House aide's fifth appearance since June
1 before the panel. The grand jury is examining whether Reagan
administration officials covered up aspects of the scandal from
Congress.
   The grand jury also heard June 27 from former North's boss,
then-National Security Adviser John Poindexter, who was sentenced
June 11 to six months in prison.
   Poindexter was convicted of covering up North's role in a secret
Contra resupply from Congress and of concealing the U.S. role in a
November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   As in past sessions, Iran-Contra prosecutor Craig Gillen went
into one of the grand jury rooms today at the U.S. Courthouse
minutes before North entered.
   Gillen works for the office of Independent Counsel Lawrence
Walsh. Walsh's office is trying to determine the precise roles in
the scandal of President Reagan, then-Vice President Bush and other
administration aides, sources have said.
   North worked closely with former State Department official
Elliott Abrams and former CIA officer Alan Fiers in connection with
the Contras. North also had contact with Donald Gregg, Bush's aide
on national security during the Iran-Contra affair.
   North was found guilty of aiding and abetting an obstruction of
Congress, altering and destroying National Security Council
documents and receiving an illegal gratuity. He and Poindexter are
appealing their convictions.
   North was placed on two years' probation, fined $150,000 and is
performing 1,200 hours of community service work.

   Masked Palestinians protesting the death of a
youth in their Jerusalem refugee camp hurled stones at riot police
who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets today.
   Police arrested three Palestinians during hit-and-run battles in
the Shuafat camp in Arab east Jerusalem, where 16-year-old Munser
Zuhdi Musa Adabed died Tuesday.
   Authorities initially said Adabed was killed by police gunfire
during clashes in Shuafat. But police spokesman Uzi Sandori said
medical evidence that became available today showed that Adabed
could not have been killed by a bullet and apparently died while
handling a bomb.
   Doctors at east Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital, where Adabed's
body was taken, said he had shrapnel wounds in his chest. The body
was later taken by relatives for burial, preventing further
examination.
   In Shuafat, black flags of mourning, outlawed Palestinian flags
and the green banners of the Moslem fundamentalists fluttered from
rooftops today. Dozens of masked youths rallied around Adabed's
house to protest his death.
   A total of 723 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since
the December 1987 start of the Palestinian uprising.
   An additional 233 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of helping Israel. Forty-five Israelis also have
died.

<TEXT>
   Italy and France are sending two ships to Albania
beginning Thursday to ferry out more than 3,500 Albanian
asylum-seekers who have holed up in three Western European
embassies, Italian authorities said.
   The first ship will leave the Italian port of Brindisi for
Albania on Thursday evening, an Interior Ministry spokesman said
today.
   It will bring out many of the approximately 2,200 people who
have packed the West German Embassy, since they have endured the
worst conditions, a Foreign Ministry official said. He spoke on the
usual ground rule of anonymity.
   The ferry operation was organized through the intercession of a
U.N. representative in Tirana, the Albanian capital. Italian
authorities said today that an accord had been reached with the
Communist government and ``now we are talking about details'' of
the operation.
   ``The Albanians have reserved for themselves the right to decide
at the last minute'' what time the ships will arrive at the
Adriatic port city of Durres, the spokesman said.
   He added that authorities were afraid that if people knew the
details of the operation, Albanians would rush to get on board and
``it would be a thing of biblical proportions.''
   Officials said the ships will transport about 2,200 people from
the West German Embassy, more than 800 from the Italian Embassy and
about 540 from the French Embassy.
   The other embassies in Tirana had fewer people and would work
out agreements individually with the Albanian government, the
Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
   Scores of Albanians began entering the embassies on June 28 in
an effort to escape Europe's last hard-line Communist bastion. Some
dodged bullets as they scrambled over embassy walls.
   The first 51 asylum-seekers left their country Tuesday for
Czechoslovakia on a plane sent by that nation's president, Vaclav
Havel.
   The Italian ferries, the Appia and Espresso Grecia, will bring
the asylum-seekers to Brindisi, about 85 miles across the Adriatic
Sea from Albania, the Merchant Marine Ministry said in a communique.
   From there, the Albanians who had been in the West German
Embassy will catch trains to West Germany, the Interior Ministry
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The two ships were chartered from the Societa Adriatica company
for the evacuation, the Interior Ministry said.
   The vessels, which carry about 1,000 people each, usually take
tourists to Greece. It was not clear whether they would have to
make return trips for the refugees.
   The first ferry will leave Brindisi Thursday evening and return
the next morning, the Interior Ministry said. The French ship will
go to Albania on Friday, the spokesman said, adding he did not know
its return destination.
   The Italian Red Cross has been preparing to provide assistance
to the refugees once they arrive in Italy. Those who sought shelter
in the French and West German embassies will be sent to those
countries, the spokesman said.
   The Italian spokesman said that ferrying out the Albanians was
``the most obvious thing'' to do since the airport in Tirana was
small.
   The Appia was used by the Red Cross during an Italian peace
mission in Lebanon in 1982, the agency said.
   Albanian leader Ramiz Alia introduced some economic reforms this
year and began to improve ties with other countries. The government
has said it would consider establishing relations with the United
States. But Alia has made clear he doesn't plan to adopt multiparty
democracy or shed key Communist principles.
   The turmoil at the embassies appeared to contribute to a
shake-up Saturday of Albania's ruling party Politburo and Central
Committee. Several hard-liners associated with the late Communist
ruler Enver Hoxha were dismissed.
   The Italian official said the shake-up ``favored this solution''
of the ferries. The official said he hoped that the adoption of
internal reforms in Albania would prevent a repetition of the
assault on the foreign embassies.
   Travel has been nearly impossible for most Albanians for 45
years, but the government recently said all Albanians over 16 were
entitled to a passport.

   Negotiators for Mozambique's leftist government and
the nation's rebels held their first direct peace talks this week
and said today they would try to end the 13-year-old insurgency.
   The talks, involving the rebels' No. 2 leader and a government
minister, could lead to a cease-fire by the end of the year, said
Mario Raffaelli, a parliamentary deputy who monitored the talks for
the Italian government.
   Both sides met Sunday, Monday and Tuesday at the Rome
headquarters of San Egidio Community, a religious organization that
aids poor immigrants in Italy, and which also observed the talks.
   The negotiations were not announced ahead of time and were held
privately.
   An estimated 600,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the
war in the southeast African nation. The rebels have been accused
of widespread civilian atrocities by the U.S. State Department and
others.
   The war has left Mozambique one of the poorest countries in the
world. Annual per capita income is about $200 and almost half the
15 million people require some level of food aid.
   Leading the Mozambican government delegation in the talks was
Armando Gebuza, minister of transport and communication. Raul
Domingos, No. 2 official for RENAMO, as the rebels are known,
headed the other delegation.
   ``We could be optimistic'' about the possibility for a
cease-fire, Raffaelli said. ``I think it's realistic that there
could be one by the end of this year, maybe in time for
Christmas,'' said Raffaelli, a Socialist who formerly was the
Foreign Ministry's undersecretary for Africa.
   Raffaelli said both sides would meet again in Rome ``as soon as
possible,'' probably within several weeks.
   RENAMO, the Portuguese acronym for the Mozambican National
Resistance, has been fighting a war against the government of the
country, which gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   ``Keeping in mind the greater interests of the Mozambican
nation, both sides have agreed on the necessity to put aside that
which divides them, and to concentrate, with priority, their
attention on that which unites them, toward creating a common
working base to realize, in a spirit of mutual comprehension, a
dialogue within which they can debate their different points of
view,'' said a communique signed by the two sides and released
today.
   Both sides said they were ready to commit themselves toward
``the search for a working platform to end the war and to create
political, economic and social conditions that will allow a lasting
peace and the normalization of life of all Mozambican citizens.''
   Before the peace talks this week, efforts by Kenya and Zimbabwe
had failed to get both sides to the negotiation table.
   Raffaelli said both sides agreed a month ago to have the talks
held in Italy. The Vatican was informed about the peace efforts but
was not directly involved, officials at the news conference said.
   Pope John Paul II visited Mozambique in September 1988.
   RENAMO says its wants recognition as a political party and free
elections, but its political program has never been clear. No
government publicly supports the rebels, although South Africa
openly backed them until it signed a mutual non-aggression pact
with Mozambique in 1984.
   Mozambique's ruling Frelimo Party dropped its Marxist label last
year and has been liberalizing the economy and politics. The
government of President Joaquim Chissano is working toward a more
market-oriented economy and is considering a constitution that
would allow independents to run for parliament. however, it has not
come out in favor of allowing opposition parties.
   The Mozambican government still receives most of its weapons
from the Soviets, but it has developed increasingly close ties with
Western countries.
   Britain helps train government troops and the United States is
the leading food donor to Mozambique.

<HEAD>Judge Broadens Supervision of Union Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge overseeing the settlement of the
government's racketeering lawsuit against the Teamsters union has
ordered broad supervision of the union's upcoming election.
   ``Complete supervision of all facets of the election process is
the only way to guarantee the integrity of the elections and
encourage extensive rank and file participation,'' U.S. District
Judge David N. Edelstein said Tuesday in approving new election
rules.
   The judge made more stringent the new voting procedures proposed
by a court-appointed administrator. He gave the elections
administrator, Michael Holland, authority over some election
functions previously assigned to officers of the local unions.
   ``The supervision in this election must indeed be expansive and
proactive,'' Edelstein said.
   Helen Hershkoff, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who
represented a Teamsters dissident group, said Edelstein's decision
was a victory for union democracy.
   ``The court really is asking for more strenuous, more vigorous
supervision than the court officer himself imagined necessary,''
said Hershkoff, who filed a brief in the case on behalf of
Teamsters for a Democratic Union.
   The rules establish secret-ballot elections of local delegates,
who in turn will nominate candidates for the Teamsters'
international board at the 1991 convention, also by secret ballot.
The board will be elected by a rank and file vote, again by secret
ballot.
   If successful, the election would be the first secret-ballot
vote in ``the history of a union which has been the historic
marionette of organized crime,'' Edelstein said.
   The election rules stem from the settlement in March 1989 of the
government's civil racketeering lawsuit against the Teamsters. The
settlement was intended to rid the 1.7 million-member union of
corruption and establish new voting procedures.
   In adopting the election rules, Edelstein overruled objections
by the union that the new voting system gave a court-appointed
administrator too much power over the union and its locals.
   At an earlier point in his opinion, the judge said he approved
rules that guaranteed elections ``completely secure from
harassment, intimidation, coercion, hooliganism, threats, or any
variant of these no matter under what guise.''
   The election rules were proposed in February by Holland, one of
three court-appointed administrators of the settlement, and were
the subject of eight hearings held around the country in March.
   ``An election under these rules beacons the coming of the light
of freedom to this dark union,'' Edelstein said. ``This court has
reiterated that this consent decree is a unique attempt to cleanse
this union. These election rules are the linchpin in that effort.''
   The judge specifically ordered that all Teamster locals submit
election plans to the administrator, that membership lists be
released to any accredited candidate and that no delegate
participate in the international convention unless directly elected.
   A call the union's general counsel, James Grady, was not
returned.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela, reportedly suffering from
pneumonia, arrived in Nairobi today and was whisked to town after a
low-key arrival ceremony. Sources said he was admitted to a
hospital.
   The black nationalist leader was diagnosed as having a slight
case of pneumonia and was flown from Ethiopia for treatment,
according to The Star newspaper of Johannesburg. The 71-year-old
Mandela was attending the Organization of African Unity's summit in
Addis Ababa.
   A hospital and a diplomatic source said Mandela was admitted to
Nairobi Hospital within hours of his arrival. Both sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Mandela looked sick upon arriving in Kenya accompanied by his
wife, Winnie. He walked slowly down the stairs to the runway,
clutching the railing.
   After greeting President Daniel arap Moi and his Cabinet and
waving to a small crowd of airport workers and security officials,
Mandela and Moi climbed into the president's limousine and were
driven away. Winnie Mandela left in a separate vehicle.
   The Star, which has a correspondent traveling with Mandela, said
the African National Congress leader caught a cold while in Ireland
and it developed into pneumonia. The paper quoted aides as saying
the pneumonia was slight and there was no cause for alarm.
   There has been repeated concern about Mandela's health since he
was released from prison in February after 27 years in jail for
fighting white minority rule.
   Mandela was hospitalized in June and had a benign cyst removed
from his bladder. Doctors have expressed concern about his heart,
and he undergoes regular medical checks. He also suffered from
tuberculosis in 1988.
   Mandela has undertaken a punishing schedule of political talks
and foreign tours since his release. But the black leader has
declined to trim his hectic schedule.

<HEAD>Library's Trustees Rescind Juvenile ``Carding'' Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK LAWN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public library trustees have rescinded a
policy that would have restricted children to a juvenile section.
   After a loud and often hostile public response Tuesday night by
more than 100 residents, the library board voted 4-3 to rescind the
limited access policy. Three of the seven trustees were absent when
the policy was adopted last month.
   The policy would have let parents in this south Chicago suburb
obtain cards for children under 14 years old that restricted them
to the juvenile section.
   Opponents of the policy argued that children would no longer
have access to such items as an encyclopedia and dictionary.
Backers of the change said parents would gain more control over
access to what their children read.
   For more than 13 years, library officials said, Oak Lawn has
allowed children access to Playboy magazine and all other library
materials, excluding music videos, which are available only to
patrons 18 and over.
   Residents attending the meeting gave the board a standing
ovation after the vote, saying the quiet suburb could return to
normal after receiving national media attention over the new policy.
   ``I'm deeply ashamed of our library and totally embarrassed,''
said resident Mary Grana before the vote. ``My friends from all
over are saying `Oh, you live in that Nazi village?'''
   Library Trustee Nancy Czerwiec, author of the limited access
policy, said arguments that it was censorship clouded the issue of
parental choice.
   ``An idea is on trial tonight _ the idea of parental choice,''
Ms. Czerwiec said.
   ``As a parent, I've always had the choice,'' said Kathleen
Miller, a resident for 25 years. ``Who are you to give me the right
I already have?''

<HEAD>College Entry Test Quizzes Students On Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High school seniors taking this year's college
entrance examination faced a new series of questions on last year's
pro-democracy protests, an official report said.
   Students were asked to ``analyze the reasons, essence and
lessons that should be drawn from last year's turmoil and
rebellion,'' said the Tuesday edition of the Yangcheng Evening News
of Canton, seen in Beijing today.
   Since it crushed the massive pro-democracy protests led by
college students, the Communist government has vowed to screen out
students who fail to meet ideological criteria.
   The government also has ordered schools at all levels to spend
more time on political education in order to ensure their graduates
are loyal socialists.
   More than 2.8 million youths nationwide took the tests on
Saturday, competing for 608,000 seats in the September freshman
class. The number of freshmen being admitted is up slightly from
last September's 597,000, but still below the 669,000 of September
1988. Authorities are believed to have cut college enrollment as
part of their efforts to prevent future student protests.
   The all-day college exams cover most academic subjects,
including history, politics, science and mathematics.
   The Yangcheng Evening News said the history section of this
year's test stressed patriotism and ``invasion and
counterinvasion'' in modern Chinese history.
   Questions focused on the mid-19th century Opium War with
Britain, which was shipping opium into China against the will of
the Chinese government, treaties that China was forced to sign
giving Western countries access to Chinese ports, and Japan's
invasion of China in World War II.
   In the past year, in the face of Western criticism of its
crackdown on the protests, China's official media have stressed
historical conflicts with the West and portrayed the country as
beseiged by imperialists.
   A separate report said the new emphasis on ideological education
was already showing success.
   The Beijing Daily said nearly 1,100 Beijing University students,
one-ninth of the student body, have applied to join the Communist
Party.
   It did not say over what period of time the applications were
made. It can take years for an application to be approved.
   ``After last year's political storm, many students at Beijing
University came to better understand through study and sober
reflection that the only way to strengthen the country is by
following the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist
Party,'' the report said.
   Beijing University students were among the leaders of the 1989
protests. The school has a tradition of political activism.

<HEAD>Aboriginal Leader Declares Provisional Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Aborigines declared a
provisional government today, claiming they have been neglected for
decades by state and federal governments and see little prospect
for change.
   Michael Mansell, secretary of the Aboriginal Provisional
Government, said it would be autonomous, raise its own funds, have
its own passports and seek recognition by foreign governments.
   ``It is a political body set up to provide leadership to the
aspirations of Aboriginal people,'' the Aboriginal activist told a
news conference. ``All we are asking is the right to control
ourselves on our own land. We don't want to interfere with you
people, but just leave us alone as well.''
   It was not immediately clear what effect, if any, the
declaration would have. The 1981 census said Australia had about
160,000 Aborigines, comprising less than 1 percent of the
population at the time.
   Estimates indicate the country had 300,000 or more Aborigines,
the indigenous people, when European settlers arrived.
   ``We would set ourselves a stage that in 20 to 30 years from
now, we would actually have enough land in this country so that
Aboriginal people could raise their own economy, legal system and
run their own government on it,'' Mansell said.
   The new government received an early rebuff when Federal
Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert Tickner canceled a meeting set
for Thursday with Mansell and other Aboriginal representatives to
discuss the return of ancestoral Aboriginal skeletal remains from
overseas.
   A spokesman for Tickner said the minister would not meet any
representatives of a provisional Aboriginal government.
   Mansell said the provisional government would encourage local
Aboriginal communities to take back what they consider their land
by squatting on it and would provide them with financial and
``people'' support to resist police and government attempts to
remove them.
   However, Mansell said the provisional government was purely a
political body and would not compete with any government bodies
that provide services to Aboriginal people.
   He said the provisional government's main aims were obtaining
land rights, gaining control over Aboriginal culture and heritage,
and pursuing the return of the Aboriginal skeletal remains from
overseas.
   Mansell denied the new government would cause greater division
between Aborigines and whites.
   ``There will always be divisions in this country because there
are two distinct peoples and there is nothing wrong with being
different,'' he said. ``The only thing that's wrong with people
being different is where one group imposes its will upon another.''
   Funding for the new government would be provided by a system of
rent payments, the sale of Aboriginal passports and donations.
   Under the rent-payment system, already in operation in Victoria
state, sympathetic whites who believe in Aboriginal sovereignty
over the continent pay nominal rent to the black community.

<TEXT>
   Artists, intellectuals and students said
today they would give up their strike only if the government agrees
to work under a new president with no links to the Communists or
their successors.
   The sit-in strikers, camping in scores of tents in the heart of
the city, forced the resignation on Friday of President Petar
Mladenov, a leading member of the governing Socialist Party of
reform Communists.
   Since then, they have made new demands and requested written
assurances from the main political parties that they will resolve
the country's problems democratically in Parliament.
   Spokesmen for the strikers said today they already had received
such assurances from the opposition Union of Democratic Forces, but
an answer from the Socialists was still outstanding.
   The peaceful strike was seen as significant because it has been
joined by top scientists and professors, including representatives
of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.
   The students began their sit-in about a month ago to protest
alleged manipulations in June's parliamentary elections, in which
the Socialists won a majority of seats.
   Their demands were contained in a declaration issued on July 6.
   Mladenov's resignation fulfilled one of those demands. But the
demonstrators also want a public trial of ousted Communist leader
Todor Zhivkov, who under investigation for alleged abuse of power,
incitement to ethnic hatred and misappropriation of state property.
   Their other demands, reiterated at an improvised open-air news
conference today, called for:
   _A new president who is not linked to the political and army
establishment.
   _Removal of parliamentary immunity from people implicated in the
running of prison camps in the 1950s, in the 1968 Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia and in the state persecution of ethnic
Turks in 1984-85.
   _The ``whole truth'' about the Bulgarian foreign debt, now about
$10 billion, and about the property of the ruling party and its
former leaders.
   Strikers have named their downtown tent camp ``the City of
Truth.''
   ``Every day we go to work, and we move in our old Communist
world. But after work we come here to this City of Truth,'' said
Ivailo Slatanov of the Academy of Science's Biophysics Institute.
   In Veliko Turnovo, 150 miles northeast of Sofia, Bulgaria's
first multiparty Parliament in 44 years faced a constitutional
crisis Tuesday as it convened its inaugural session without a
president.
   Mladenov resigned Friday after admitting he suggested in
December tanks be used to disperse tens of thousands of
demonstrators rallying against communist power. No tanks were ever
used.
   He had been instrumental a month earlier in toppling Bulgaria's
hard-line leaders, but the Communist Party remained in control of
the government.
   The opening session, a ceremonial affair held in sweltering
heat, was adjourned after only 40 minutes and will resume July 17
at the Parliament building in Sofia.
   The Grand National Assembly's first task will be to agree on a
presidential candidate and elections. There is no precedent for
electing a president in Bulgaria's parliamentary history.

   Democratic Chairman Ronald Brown made it
official today _ the party's 1992 national convention will be held
in New York City.
   ``Democrats will nominate the next president of the United
States two years from now this week in America's most dynamic city
and in one of the world's greatest cities _ New York, the Big
Apple,'' Brown said in announcing the decision.
   Brown also said he was considering several format changes for
the convention, including possibly cutting the event from four days
to three and holding it on the weekend instead of mid-week.
   Brown, flanked by Democratic members of the New York
congressional delegation, made the selection announcement at party
headquarters before heading to New York to celebrate the news with
Mayor David Dinkins and other city officials.
   New York was Brown's favorite from the outset of the search and
word of his choice leaked Monday after the chairman told top aides
he had made up his mind.
   New York officials believe the convention will pump some $100
million into the city's economy, and landing the event is a plum
for Dinkins, who lobbied agressively for more than a year to
convince Brown to bring the party to New York, which hosted
Democratic conventions in 1976 and 1980.
   ``It's a real shot in the arm for the city, and a real triumph
for Dinkins,'' said New York state Democratic Chairman John Marino.
   It was at the 1976 convention that the party nominated its last
winner, Jimmy Carter, and Brown predicted New York would bring the
Democrats luck again.
   ``In the 1990s, America will need a world class leader,'' Brown
said. ``George Bush falls short of that mark. In New York _ a world
class city _ we Democrats will nominate a president capable of
reclaiming America's rightful place as the world's most vigorous
advocate of freedom and most potent ally of Democracy.''
   Even before Brown's official announcement there was renewed
speculation over who will be the star of the nomination show at
Madison Square Garden, with New York Gov. Mario Cuomo figuring
prominently in the discussions.
   ``I think Cuomo will make the bid,'' said Democratic consultant
Bob Beckel, who predicted a handful of Democrats ultimately would
enter the 1992 race.
   For his part, Cuomo said landing the convention was ``great
news'' for New York City. But the governor, who faces re-election
this year, said the site would not affect his decision whether to
enter the presidential race.
   In any event, Cuomo said a New York convention wouldn't boost a
Cuomo candidacy. ``You could make the argument that having it in a
state other than your own would be better,'' he said Tuesday.
   Brown grew up in New York and is close to Dinkins, making the
city his favorite from the outset of the site search. New Orleans
was the other finalist, but Brown told aides Monday that New York
was his choice.
   The city's early pledge to come up with the more than $20
million needed to get the Garden ready for the event and a pledge
by prominent Democratic fund-raisers in the city to fill the
party's coffers went a long way in influencing Brown.
   Brown had said that New Orleans' chances were being hurt by the
Louisiana Legislature's passage of strong anti-abortion
legislation. ``It was a factor but not the deciding factor,'' Brown
said today while offering repeated praise for New Orleans and
Louisiana officials.
   The site search had attracted considerable attention, in part
because of the lack of declared Democratic challengers to Bush.
   ``This is the strangest, quietest presidential political
environment I have ever been in,'' said Democratic consultant Frank
Greer.
   But Beckel and other Democratic activists said potential 1992
candidates are taking a fresh look at the race of late because of a
growing impression that Bush can be beat.
   Democratic Sens. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, Albert Gore of Tennessee and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska are
among those said to be considering 1992 runs. And in the past week
several Democrats have said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt
of Missouri has indicated he might reconsider his pledge not to run
in 1992.
   Others frequently mentioned in such speculation include Govs.
Bill Clinton of Arkansas and L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia.

<TEXT>
   Mongolia on Wednesday reopened its consulate in
the northern Chinese region of Inner Mongolia after a 31-year
suspension of consular ties.
   Consul General Jundui Saara led a flag-raising ceremony at the
provisional site of the consulate in Hohhot, the capital of the
autonomous region, the official Xinhua News Agency said in a
three-sentence report.
   The dispatch did not say when the two countries decided to
resume consular ties, but it likely was discussed when Mongolian
President Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat visited China in May.
   His visit was the first for a Mongolian head of government since
1962, and the trip formally normalized three decades of strained
relations.
   About 3.5 million ethnic Mongols live in Inner Mongolia, a swath
of steppe and desert just inside China's northern border with
Mongolia, which has a population of 2 million.
   Inner Mongolia remained part of China when outer Mongolia won
independence in a 1921 uprising and became the world's second
Communist state.
   Mongolia, which has long been a Soviet satellite state, sided
with the Soviet Union when Moscow split with Beijing over
ideological differences in the late 1950s.

   A more than monthlong labor truce declared during
the soccer World Cup ended Wednesday with strikes at airports and
gasoline pumps.
   The strike by the technicians who approve plane takeoffs and
landings stranded thousands of travelers at Italian airports.
Unions had called a six-hour strike but the action was called off
after 4{ hours when the government agreed to consider their
demands, the Transport Ministry said.
   Strikers want increased overtime pay and more money for
increases in productivity.
   Union officials said they allowed planes running short of fuel
to make their scheduled landings, and regular service continued
between the mainland and the islands of Sicily and Sardinia.
   With a few exceptions, Italy's major unions refrained from
strikes to ensure visitors would not be inconvenienced during the
soccer tournament that ended Sunday.
   In another labor action, thousands of gas station operators shut
their pumps for 24 hours to pressure the government to lower the
taxes on their profits.
   Newsstand dealers seeking more revenue from newspapers have
announced they will stay open only in the mornings for three days
starting Thursday.

   Mozambican rebels killed three people in

Saturday, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The three Zambians died when Mozambique National Resistance
rebels ambushed a truck Tuesday near the town of Nyimba, 200 miles

   Rebels on Saturday axed seven people to death, wounded two and
kidnapped an unknown number to act as porters carrying salt into
Mozambique for the rebels, the Daily Mail said.
   The rebels, also known by the Portuguese acronym Renamo, often
cross from Mozambique into neighboring Zambia, mainly to steal food
and supplies.
   Zambian troops were sent to the Petauke border district Saturday
to patrol roads where attacks have occurred. No rebels have been
reported captured in recent days.

   The only pipeline feeding Moslem west
Beirut with drinking water burst Wednesday, flooding a coastal
highway linking the capital with south Lebanon.
   About a dozen ramshackle huts on both sides of the Ouzai highway
were flooded with water that damaged furniture and created panic
among refugees. Several shops were destroyed by the water pouring
in from the street at 5 a.m.
   Some refugees drained the water into buckets which they emptied
into the Mediterranean. Others dug holes in the floors of their
huts to let the water out.
   ``I was soaking. I woke up and didn't know what was going on,''
said Fatima Hasan, a squatter living in a beachside hut with her
husband and eight children. ``My daughters and I immediately began
filling up buckets and emptying them in the sea.''
   The water pressure carved a 43-inch crater in the street, which
children quickly turned into a swimming pool.
   There was no word on how long it would take to restore water to
the Moslem sector of the Lebanese capital, but the more than 1
million people living there have long been able to manage without
potable water by using bottled water or standing in lines at
springs.

<TEXT>
   Security forces nearly captured Pablo
Escobar, the reputed leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel, when
they arrested 11 top cartel members in a raid on a northeastern
town, police said today.
   The raid, which also seized 3{ tons of dynamite, came Tuesday
and followed last month's police killing of the mastermind of the
cartel's terror campaign.
   Among the 11 people arrested in Puerto Triunfo, 75 miles east of
Bogota, was Escobar's personal physician, according to a national
police report read over the RCN radio network.
   Also captured was one of Escobar's relatives, Hernan Dario
Quintero, who supplied dynamite and weapons to gunmen hired to
carry out the cartel's bombing and assassination campaigns, the
report said.
   A national police spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press today that security forces
nearly nabbed Escobar as well but that the billionaire fugitive
escaped into the jungle.
   The spokesman said Escobar, aided by about 15 bodyguards, fled
into the jungle near Puerto Triunfo during the raid.
   Drug traffickers fighting a 10-month-old war against the
government of President Virgilio Barco have responded with more car
bombings, massacres and police assassinations that have killed
hundreds of people.
   In Tuesday's raid, police also seized several Soviet-made AK-47
automatic rifles, revolvers, 7,700 pounds of dynamite,
sophisticated communications equipment and documents that could
lead to Escobar's capture, the police report said.
   RCN did not give details about the other alleged cartel members
arrested.
   Escobar remains at large despite a massive manhunt to find him.
The government is offering a reward of $400,000 for information
leading to his capture, dead or alive.
   Gen. Harold Bedoya, Medellin's army commander, has accused
Escobar of the June 23 massacre of 19 people, many of them teen-age
students, at a Medellin bar. He said the attack was carried out in
retaliation for authorities killing the cartel's terrorist
operations chief, John Jairo Arias, in the city June 13.
   Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city with almost 3 million
inhabitants 150 miles northwest of Bogota, has seen much of the
drug violence.
   Authorities say drug traffickers have placed a bounty of $4,300
on the heads of all police officers in the city.
   More than 100 have been killed this year.
   The army said security forces on July 4 seized 800 pounds of
cocaine aboard a plane that was about to take off for the United
States.
   Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a Medellin cartel leader killed in
December on Colombia's northern coast.
   The drug war began in August, when traffickers were blamed for
the assassination of leading presidential hopeful Luis Carlos
Galan. Two more presidential candidates were assassinated before
last month's election, and traffickers were linked to at least one
of those.
   Since August, Barco's administration has extradited 15 drug
suspects and confiscated hundreds of properties belonging to the
cocaine magnates.
   At one time, the Medellin cartel was believed responsible for
most of the cocaine that is smuggled into the United States.

   A 27-year-old woman testified today that she
and Marion Barry snorted cocaine repeatedly from 1987 to 1989 in
apartments, homes, boats and on two trips to the Bahamas.
   ``I hit the cocaine and he hit the cocaine,'' Theresa
Southerland said of a get-together with Barry in March 1988 at the
Washington residence of a friend of the mayor.
   Barry scooped up cocaine on a business card and inhaled it,
Southerland told the jury at Barry's drug and perjury trial.
   On another occasion, she tried opium with Barry, but didn't like
it, she testified.
   ``It had a funny taste,'' she said, and made her feel
``lightheaded.''
   She said the mayor smoked it with restaurateur Hassan Mohammadi
at Mohammadi's home. The restaurateur testified that he knew
Southerland only as Miss T.
   Southerland said she met Barry at a Washington nightclub and
that the two became intimate.
   ``Marion invited me'' to the Bahamas around Thanksgiving 1987,
she said. Barry produced some cocaine, piled it atop a dollar bill
and took ``three or four hits,'' she said.
   She asked Barry if she could go on a 1988 trip to the Bahamas.
They stayed in separate rooms ``because I was concerned about the
press,'' she said. She had carried some cocaine with her on the
trip and the mayor helped her snort it, she testified.
   Southerland said that on two occasions, the mayor invited her
aboard boats moored at Washington-area marinas, where the two used
cocaine.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued a bench
warrant for Southerland when she failed to appear in court Tuesday
due to a scheduling mixup with her lawyer.
   On Tuesday, Barry's lawyers sought to portray Mohammadi as
willing to tell any story to avoid being deported to his native
Iran.
   What would happen if he were sent back? asked Robert Mance, one
of Barry's lawyers.
   ``I would be prosecuted'' by the ``new regime'' in Tehran for
having worked for the deposed government of the late Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi at the Iranian Embassy here, Mohammadi replied.
   Mohammadi testified that he supplied cocaine and opium to Barry
at least 30 times. He said he and the mayor snorted cocaine in the
upstairs bathroom at Barry's home while 200 guests were outside the
house at a summer crab feast.
   He said he and the mayor smoked opium repeatedly at locations
around Washington.
   Mohammadi said initially that he used cocaine only with Barry.
Under questioning from Mance, he acknowledged that he did use it
once with a woman who was with Barry on a 1987 trip to the Bahamas.
   Under defense questioning, Mohammadi acknowledged he had pleaded
guilty and cooperated with the government in a prosecution
involving payoffs to an immigration official. The bribes were on
behalf of wealthy Iranians seeking permanent resident status in the
United States.
   ``Every time that you get into trouble ... you get out by
cooperating,'' Mance told Mohammadi.
   In connection with the probe of Barry, Mohammadi has pleaded
guilty to conspiring to possess cocaine.
   If Mohammadi is found to have cooperated fully with the
government, the Justice Department will recommend that he not be
deported.
   Mance suggested that Mohammadi's differing stories influenced by
his tenuous status in the United States and his desire to please
prosecutors by telling then what they want to hear.
   Mohammadi detailed at the trial how the mayor shoved cocaine
into a marijuana cigarette and smoked it, calling it an ``M.B.
Special.'' Mance noted that Mahammadi didn't mention the incident
in his grand jury testimony in April.
   Mohammadi said he didn't tell the grand jury about it because he
wasn't asked about it.
   He said he lied to police in February 1989 by denying that the
mayor was involved with drugs, then reported back to Barry on what
questions the police had asked.
   ``I covered wherever I could,'' said Mohammadi. ``I was a true
friend for Mr. Mayor; I was always there for Mr. Mayor.''
   The restaurateur said he started cooperating with the government
after Barry was arrested Jan. 18 in an FBI sting because
``everybody came from the woodwork. I did not have any choice''
because he had been implicated in Barry's drug use by others.
   Barry is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession, one count
of conspiracy and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury
about his drug use.

   Provincial riot police and Mohawk Indians
blocking access to a golf course expansion project engaged in a gun
battle today, and a police officer was shot and killed, authorities
said.
   Mohawk leaders also said they took a police officer hostage, but
police did not immediately confirm the report.
   ``We are now attacking the barricades and trying to pull them
down,'' said police spokesman Richard Bourdon. ``Indians inside are
firing at police.''
   Police said Cpl. Marcel Lemay, 31, was shot in the mouth and
died about an hour after arriving at nearby St-Eustache hospital,
doctors said.
   Hundreds of shots were exchanged in the gun battle along the
blocked access road.
   The crackle of semi-automatic gunfire and the thud of tear gas
canisters could be heard from the area as armed provincial police
officers, dressed in olive-green fatigues and wearing gas masks,
confronted the young natives, who had handkerchiefs tied across
their noses and mouths.
   As the wind moved the tear gas back across their lines, police
quickly retreated.
   Ambulances were dispatched to a campsite where about 300
Indians, including women and children, have been living to oversee
barricades in the land dispute involving Oka, a town of 3,000 that
is 18 miles west of Montreal, and the nearby Kanesatake Indian
community.
   South of Montreal, another Mohawk community blocked roads in
solidarity with the Indians in Oka, and thousands of commuters
could not reach the city.
   In Quebec City, acting public security minister Michel Page said
he did not authorize the police action in Oka. An aide to Premier
Robert Bourassa said the premier was not contacted before police
moved in.
   Earlier this week, John Ciaccia, the minister for native
affairs, pleaded with Oka town council to put its plans for a golf
course on hold.
   About 100 provinical riot police surrounded the wooded area in
Oka, a suburb northwest of Montreal Island early today.
   They ordered the people behind the barricade to move away so it
could be torn down to enforce a court injunction ordering the
Indians to let traffic pass. Bourdon said police then moved in to
tear them down and were shot at.
   ``The reason we moved was because the Mohawks were breaking the
law,'' Bourdon said. ``They were blocking a public road and this is
a criminal act.''
   A Mohawk woman standing near the police lines in Oka, Eleanor
Montour, 67, said: ``I find it awful that police would attack our
people.''
   ``We're not savages, we're proud to be Mohawks,'' she said. ``We
were pushed around for centuries and we're being pushed again and
we're getting awfully tired of it.''
   Police and the Mohawks pulled back from their positions after
the gunfight. The Indians then seized four police cars and two vans
and used a commandeered front-end loader to crush and overturn the
vehicles to form another barricade. Thick black smoke belched from
a pile of burning tires.
   The Indians also used the front-end loader to tear up one green
on the golf course, a photographer at the site said.
   One jubilant Mohawk fired his shotgun as the police cars were
put in place. Armed Indians barricaded a road to the golf course
three months ago to stop the expansion project.
   Oka _ which is next to the Kanesatake Mohawk community near the
golf course _ rents the land to the operators of the private
nine-hole course. The operators say they want to cut down the white
pine forest on the land and expand the course to 18 holes.
   The land has been in the hands of the town since 1947, but the
Kanesatake Mohawk settlement surrounds it, and the Indians have
always maintained it is their land.
   In a show of support for the Mohawks at Oka, armed Mohawks from
the Kahnawake reserve south of Montreal set up roadblocks on two
main highways leading to the Mercier Bridge, blocking thousands of
residents on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River from getting
to their jobs in Montreal.
   They parked pickup trucks and other vehicles including a dump
truck across the highways. Construction workers on the bridge were
evacuated.
   The roadblacks will remain until provincial police pull out of
Oka, said one of the Mohawks.

   A jury deliberated 11 minutes
before convicting a man of animal cruelty for stabbing his
rambunctious puppy to death.
   Everston Eugene Webb, 22, of Orange Park, was convicted Tuesday.
Prosecutors said they will seek the maximum sentence of five years
in prison and a $10,000 fine when Webb is sentenced July 31 by
Circuit Court Judge Giles P. Lewis.
   Webb stabbed the pup at least five times in the chest with a
butcher knife at his home May 11.
   He testified he killed the dog to ``put it out of its misery''
because it had been injured by a friend.
   However, under cross-examination, Webb said the puppy annoyed
him when it dug in the yard and got into the family's garbage.

   A moderate earthquake shook parts of
southeast Alaska and the southwest corner of the Yukon early today,
but no damage or injuries were reported.
   Paul Whitmore of the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said the
quake registered a preliminary magnitude of 5.7 on the Richter
scale, too weak to generate a tsunami or seismic sea wave.
   The quake was relatively shallow, about nine miles beneath the
surface, and was centered about 40 miles northwest of Haines,
Alaska, Whitmore said.
   It was felt strongly in Haines and also was widely noticed in
Juneau and in Whitehorse, the Yukon territorial capital, he said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable
damage, and 6 can be severe.
   The quake that killed 131 people in 1964 in Alaska registered
8.4 on the Richter scale.

   More than 2,000 firefighters on
Wednesday mastered a series of wildfires that had blackened scenic
southern France in the first major wave of fires to strike this
year.
   About 50 separate blazes burned through Tuesday night into
Wednesday, the worst consuming 4,950 acres of forest near the
village of Coudoux, north of Marseille.
   At least a dozen homes were destroyed in the region, but no one
was killed. Three firefighters suffered smoke inhalation.
   Officials said the casualty toll could have been much worse. In
a nearby pine forest, heat from the blaze exploded a stock of bombs
buried after World War II. Firefighters stayed clear of the area.
   Fires also struck near Aix-en-Provence, Septemes-les-Vallons and
dozens of other locations, but there were no reports of property
losses or injuries.
   In all, some 8,650 acres of brushland and forest burned. Flames
were driven by 75 mph wind pushing down the Rhone River from the
north.
   Investigators said at least two fires had suspicious origins. A
local resident said she saw youths hurl flaming, gasoline-soaked
tennis balls into dry brush.

   Summit? What summit?
   Houston's cab drivers and business owners had looked forward to
big profits from the onslaught of officials, aides and journalists
at this week's economic summit.
   Not so.
   Lavish spreads of food and prompt bus service _ all free _ left
local people with empty cash registers.
   ``Business hathere might as well not even be a
summit as far as I'm concerned,'' cab driver Charles Rough said.
``Nobody needs transportation.''
   Not even President Bush's favorite barbecue spot couls been so slow,
d lure
thousands of summit-goers out of the George R. Brown Convention
Center.
   Why leave? They were being served round-the-clock buffets of
kung pao chicken, swordfish and angel hair pasta.
   The endless selections, and roadblocks that made traveling a
hassle, did wonders for the caterers but not much for Houston's
Tex-Mex and Texas barbecue eateries.
   ``It's been terrible. We usually serve 500 people a day, but
Monday (the first day of the summit) we only served 100,'' said
Robin Upton, a manager at Otto's Bar-B-Q, President Bush's favorite
spot for mesquite-grilled fixings in Houston.
   ``They have barricaded the people so they can't get out or in.
We are right on Memorial (Parkway), where all the trafure aid. They gave
West
Germany the green light to complete a $3.1 billion loan, and aid
from the others will surely follow.
   Overall, it is a giant leap toward trust after decades of Cold
War suspicion and brinksmanship.
   The summit urged Gorbachev to take ``more radical steps'' to
shift billions now spent on the Red Army and on Cuba into the sad
Soviet domestic economy. He's probably planning to do this anyway
in his drive to improve living conditions and hold to the levers of
power.
   If Gorbachev succeeds in this, he stands to gain ``meaningful
and sustained economic assistance,'' the windup summit communique
said.
   It was the West's second philosophical swing within a week. Not
as dramatic perhaps as NATO's decision to reduce its reliance on
nuclear weapons, the rendering of first technical and then probably
more direct assistance can't help but draw East and West even
closer.
   ``The NATO summit took us toward a more peaceful world,'' a
British spokesman said on behalf Margaret Thatcher. ``She believes
this takes us to a more prosperous world.''
   A senior U.S. official who has played a prominent role in
framing administration policy put it this way:
   ``There is a potential for a new economic relationship between
the Soviets and the industrial West. I wouldn't say the
relationship is there yet. But what Gorbachev gets out of this
summit is a clear, unequivocal affirmation of the belief of the
Seven that it is incumbent upon the West to help perestroika
succeed.''
   Reflecting, the official concluded: ``What this says is that
we're serious about this. We would not be going through this effort
and analysis otherwise.''
   Unthinkable only last July, when Gorbachev knocked on the summit
door and was brushed aside as a Communist intruder, the United
States, Britain, France, West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada have
themselves crossed a threshold.
   They emerged from this year's summit in sun-baked Houston,
itself a testimony to nervy free enterprise, dedicated to
perestroika and committed to invest in Gorbachev's success.
   ``There's a common determination that we have to respond very
positively to Mr. Gorbachev's request for a sustained economic
dialogue between the Soviet Union and the Group of Seven,''
Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark said.
   In declaring nuclear weapons a highly unlikely last resort, the
NATO allies in their 41st year moved beyond containment toward one
Europe.
   In committing themselves to help Gorbachev in ``practical
ways,'' the summit leaders blurred the 45-year divide between
capitalism and communism.
   At the start, the industrialized democracies will take measured
steps, beginning with a study conducted by bankers and other
experts of the inefficient Soviet economy and the tentative moves
by Gorbachev over his five years in power toward free-market
reforms.
   The study, under the supervision of the International Monetary
Fund, is supposed to be completed by December _ although officials
at the World Bank said a year would be more like it.
   In the meantime, a tide of technical assistance is likely to
flow West to East.
   At this stage, Bush is reluctant to go further. He wants the
Soviets to cut military spending, abandon Cuba and convert to a
genuine free-market system. The summit agreed, and so if these
conditions are met, Bush may brave political fire from his right
and propose more significant U.S. aid.
   ``I don't think you should ever say never,'' Secretary of State
James A. Baker III said Tuesday in refusing to permanently rule out
direct U.S. aid.
   And will Gorbachev be pleased with the results of this summit?
   ``I think he will find in the response a positive encouragement
to persist in his reforms, and that seems to us all the essential
point,'' Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, concluded.

   A graduate student was sentenced to
life in prison for murdering a professor who denied him a doctorate.
   Jens Peter Hansen, 42, was sentenced Tuesday for the
first-degree murder of University of Florida cancer researcher
Arthur Kimura last Sept. 1.
   The sentence means Hansen must serve at least 25 years before
being eligible for parole. Circuit Judge Robert Cates also
sentenced him to four years for a burglary-with-assault conviction,
to be served concurrently.
   A jury convicted Hansen on June 21.
   Hansen and his attorney, Steve Bernstein, asked unsuccessfully
for a retrial. They claimed Hansen was insane when he devised an
elaborate plan to kill Kimura in the professor's home and attempt
to make it appear to be suicide.
   Assistant State Attorney John Carlin argued against the insanity
claim.
   ``What caused the tragedy was a monumental ego and a revengeful
spirit,'' he said.
   Kimura was head of a committee that in August 1989 denied Hansen
a doctoral degree in pathology. Trial testimony showed that Kimura
and other committee members voted to drop Hansen from the program
because he was straying from his goals and conducting low-quality
research.
   On Sept. 1, Hansen packed rope, a pistol and a padded baseball
bat into a rented van and drove to Kimura's home. He planned to
kill the professor by knocking him out and placing him in his car
with the engine running to make it appear to be a suicide,
testimony showed.
   The plan apparently failed when Kimura set off his burglar
alarm, alerting police. Hansen shot Kimura in the head outside the
house and was arrested a few minutes later, testimony showed.

   Ah, Fire Island. The sun, the surf, the
sand, the corroded telephones.
   New York Telephone is replacing all outdoor coin-operated phones
on the resort island with phones that accept no cash, company
spokesman Tom Pica said Tuesday. Coins tend to carry sand and salt
into the phones' innards, ruining the mechanisms, he said.
   Collect calls, or those billed to a third party or a calling
card, can be made on the new phones. Those carry surcharges ranging
form 30 cents to $1.48, he acknowledged.
   Pica said that on average, 20 percent of the phones are out of
service. Getting repair workers to Fire Island, a barrier island
off the south shore of Long Island, is expensive because of its
remoteness, he said.
   By August, all 80 outdoor pay phones should be replaced. Pica
said 25 coin-operated phones inside restaurants and other stores
will be kept.

   First lady Barbara Bush met with young cancer
patients today while the wives of the other summit leaders toured
different parts of the renowned Texas Medical Center.
   The women visited the medical center this morning before their
husbands issued their final communique on the three-day summit at
the George R. Brown Convention Center.
   Mrs. Bush went to the pediatric division of the M.D. Anderson
Cancer Center where she talked with children attending summer
classes at the hospital.
   One of the patients, 15-year-old Denis Lokter, came from the
Soviet Union to get treatment.
   ``We had a wonderful visit from your president,'' Mrs. Bush told
the youth referring Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev's recent trip
to the United States.
   The children gave her a book filled with drawings of dinosaurs
they had made on a computer. They also presented her with a package
of Christmas cards designed by children at the hospital.
   ``I think she was really good,'' said Patrick Chapman, who
turned 7 today.
   ``She called me a nickname _ Fang _ because I don't have a tooth
here,'' he said referring to his missing front tooth.
   Mrs. Bush was joined by France's Danielle Mitterrand, Canada's
Mila Mulroney, Italy's Livia Andreotti, and Japan's Sachiyo Kaifu.
They went to different hospitals at the 600-acre medical center
complex that includes 14 hospitals and two medical schools and four
nursing schools.
   England's Denis Thatcher, the only male spouse, did not visit a
hospital.
   Hannelore Kohl, wife of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and
Marie Delors, wife of European Commission President Jacques Delors
did not accompany their husbands to Texas.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Bush took the four women to San Antonio to
visit an 18th century mission and the Alamo, while Thatcher visited
his son, Mark, in Dallas.
   ``Nobody can come to Texas without seeing the Alamo,'' Mrs. Bush
told the crowd of several hundred people who braved the heat and
lined up along police barricades to cheer the first ladies.
   ``I wanted to show off a different part of Texas. I wanted them
to see a side of Texas that you might not see any place else, not
only in Texas but in this country,'' she said.
   ``You've really turned out for us and given us a wonderful
day.'' she said.
   At the Alamo, San Antonio Mayor Lila Cockrell gave the women
proclamations saying they were all ``alcaldes,'' or mayors, of the
original San Antonio.
   The Alamo is the site of the historic 1836 battle between the
Mexican army and a group of men led by Col. William Travis who were
fighting for Texas' independence from Mexico.
   Mexican Gen. Santa Anna's troops greatly outnumbered the Alamo
forces, although historical records do not provide an exact number.
The Mexican soldiers laid siege on the Alamo for 14 days before
attacking.
   All 189 of Travis' men were killed, and the tragic fight gave
birth to the battle cry, ``Remember the Alamo!''
   Earlier, the women were greeted by about 900 children at the
Majestic Theater, a palatial theater built in 1929 and restored and
reopened last August.
   The children, from the city's parks and recreation program, were
told about their prestigious visitors only at the last minute. They
cheered and waved miniature Texas flags as the women entered the
ornate theater.
   The spouses also visited the Mission San Jose where they heard
traditional mariachi music.
   The mission, established in 1720 by a Franciscan priest, is one
of five old Spanish missions still standing in San Antonio.

   Melody Augustin wound up wanting what she
didn't get when she bought pop rock performer Sinead O'Connor's new
compact disc, ``I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got.''
   Mrs. Augustin, 42, of this Pittsburgh suburb, bought the disc
Tuesday at a Camelot Music store. When she got home, she fed it
into her CD player while preparing to feed dinner to her kids,
5-year-old twins Matt and Mark and 9-year-old John.
   ``They came running in the kitchen and told me, `Rad, mom. This
is tremendous,''' Mrs. Augustin said. ``I said, `That's great. I'm
glad you like Sinead O'Connor.' They said, `We didn't know Sinead
O'Connor was in `Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.' ''
   The box and disc were marked Sinead O'Connor, but contained the
movie soundtrack from ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.'' Mrs.
Augustin said she jumped from track to track, trying to find
O'Connor's hit, ``Nothing Compares 2 U.''
   All she got was ``Turtle Power.'' ``Heavy, heavy rap,'' she said
Tuesday night, laughing. She planned to return the disc despite her
children's delight.
   The assistant manager of the music store, Jennifer Baker, said
such mix-ups are not unsual. A second woman who bought a CD Tuesday
thinking it would be O'Connor also wound up with another tape, she
said.

   The Sandinista labor union called
today for an easing of street skirmishes and asked the government
to open talks immediately to end the crippling strike they are
leading.
   The move by the National Workers' Front, the labor federation
leading the strike, followed a plea from the region's leaders for
the world to help the 10-week-old government.
   At least four people have been killed and 84 injured in unrest
that began after tens of thousands of government workers went on
strike 11 days ago. There were no new reports of victims today,
although gunfire and explosions rattled the city following gun
battles late Tuesday.
   ``In agreement with what the constitutional government
expressed, we urge the start of negotiations between the government
and the FNT (the front) to find a solution to the demands presented
by the workers,'' a front communique said.
   The statement, read on pro-Sandinista Radio Ya, proposed that
the negotiations begin at 2 p.m. (4 p.m. EDT).
   The front called on strikers ``to create conditions that favor
the start of negotiations by allowing circulation of citizens and
transportation at the points where Sandinista police demand it.''
   The statement indicated that the union was calling an informal
truce for only several hours. The front includes the three striking
Sandinista unions.
   A government statement late Tuesday expressed hope that the
situation would be resolved peacefully.
   The explosions and gunfire persisted into the early morning
hours, following gun battles Tuesday between government backers and
opponents.
   For a third day, the city was paralyzed, its streets a honeycomb
of brick barricades manned by armed people. Sandinista squads
opened trenches in roads.
   Police used bulldozers to try to clean the streets. Without
public transportation since Monday, thousands tried again to get to
their jobs on foot. Food supplies were shrinking because of the
transportation problems, and supermarkets again were closed.
   Police and army troops removed an armed pro-government group
that was occupying the independent Radio Corporacion about
midnight, and about 20 policemen remained inside the station this
morning, one of the group said.
   ``We were defending the station from the Sandinista gangs that
were trying to burn it,'' said Roger Leon Carranza, a journalist
with the station. He said police took the group to a location
provided by Roman Catholic priests.
   The group, which had been using Radio Corporation offices as its
headquarters, shot one of the soldiers and pulled the other from
their vehicle and beat him on Tuesday, witnesses said. The wounded
soldier was hospitalized.
   Some residents said they saw army soldiers joining Sandinistas
building barricades. The Sandinistas still control the army and
police.
   ``A minority of some 3,000 armed Sandinistas control the city
and are holding more than a million inhabitants hostage,'' the
government's Radio Nicaragua said today.
   The Sandinistas oppose layoffs of civil servants ordered by the
U.S.-backed government, which is trying to cut the budget deficit
and nurse back to health an economy ravaged by a decade of war and
U.S. trade sanctions.
   Opposition is also strong in the country of 3.7 million people
to government plans to sell many of the properties the Sandinistas
confiscated and nationalized after coming to power in a 1979
popular revolution.
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro ordered out the army and
police to restore order Monday night as both strike sympathizers
and opponents _ including some former Contra rebel leaders _
exchanged gunfire, rocks and punches.
   The presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and
Honduras issued a vague joint declaration late Tuesday ``calling on
the international community to lend its valuable assistance to the
Nicaraguan government in its search for a solution to the crisis it
is undergoing.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, speaking at a news
conference in Houston, hedged on the U.S. position on Nicaragua's
quandary but stated, ``It goes without saying that we would want to
be helpful in securing democracy in Nicaragua ... so we would want
to be helpful.''
   Strike leaders say 90,000 workers are taking part in the
walkout, which the government has declared illegal.
   The strike has closed the international airport, cut electricity
and water service, limited telephone and mail delivery, reduced
gasoline supplies and shut down factories and businesses.
   The violence poses the biggest challenge to Mrs. Chamorro since
her United National Opposition coalition took control of the
government April 25, having defeated the leftist Sandinistas in
free elections.
   In an effort at reconciliation, she left the Sandinistas in
control of the army and police. That angered the Contras, who for
months hesitated to surrender their weapons but finally gave in
last week.
   Many pro-Sandinista groups at roadblocks Tuesday carried
Soviet-bloc AK-47 assault rifles, standard issue in the Sandinista
army.

<HEAD>Ship Cruises To Albania To Pick Up Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian-chartered ferry left Wednesday for
Albania to pick up many of the 4,000 asylum-seekers who fled to
foreign embassies to escape hard-line Communist rule.
   Another Italian ship and a French vessel also are expected to
reach Albania in coming days as part of the operation, arranged
with United Nations assistance.
   ``The Albanians have reserved for themselves the right to decide
at the last minute'' what time the ships will arrive at the
Adriatic city of Durres, an Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
   He said authorities were afraid that if they released the
details, other Albanians would rush to get on board and ``it would
be a thing of biblical proportions.''
   The ferry operation was expected to defuse a crisis that has
shaken Albania's hard-line Communist government and stalled its
recent efforts to reach out to the West. The rush to the embassies,
and a series of accompanying demonstrations, were the biggest
challenge to the government in decades.
   One Italian-chartered ship, the Appia, left Venice on Wednesday
afternoon carrying nine nurses and three doctors from the Red
Cross, said Lino De Rosa, a director of the Societa Adriatica
Navigazione, the ships' owners.
   Another vessel, the Espresso Grecia, was to leave Thursday from
the southern Italian city of Brindisi, he said. The ships were to
wait in the Durres harbor until the Albanians decide to let them
dock, expected late Thursday or early Friday.
   The first ship will bring refugees back to Brindisi Friday
morning and a French ship would likely arrive in Albania the same
day, an Italian Interior Ministry spokesman said.
   The first Italian ship to return will probably carry many of the
Albanians who have packed the West German Embassy, since they are
in the worst condition, the Foreign Ministry official said,
speaking on the usual ground rule of anonymity.
   Scores of Albanians began entering the embassies on June 28 to
escape Europe's last Stalinist regime. Some dodged bullets as they
scrambled over embassy walls.
   Between 4,000 and 5,000 Albanians are believed to be in the
embassies, about 2,200 in the West German mission alone. The
arrivals have dropped off dramatically since police reimposed a
cordon around the embassy quarter this week, diplomats said.
   Italian authorities said an accord had been reached with the
Communist government on removing the Albanians and ``now we are
talking about details.'' The agreement was mediated by U.N. envoy
Stefan de Mitsura.
   Officials said the ships will transport the refugees in the West
German Embassy, more than 800 from the Italian Embassy and about
540 from the French Embassy.
   The other embassies in Tirana had fewer people and would work
out agreements individually with the Albanian government, the
Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
   Many embassies had been running low on food and medicine for the
asylum-seekers.
   Imre Koltai, an adviser at the Hungarian commercial office in
Tirana, was quoted in the Budapest daily Nepszabadsag as saying
that the 50 Albanians in the Hungarian Embassy were sleeping on the
floor of the dining room, covered with curtains.
   ``Most of them want to leave for economic reasons,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   The 51 asylum-seekers in the Czechoslovak Embassy in Tirana were
the first to depart, when they flew to Prague Tuesday on a plane
sent by Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel.
   The Italian ferries each carry about 1,000 people and usually
take tourists to Greece. They will take about five hours to travel
from Durres to Brindisi, about 85 miles across the Adriatic Sea, De
Rosa said.
   From Brindisi, the Albanians who had been in West Germany's
embassy will catch trains to that country, the Interior Ministry
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Interior Ministry said the Albanians who had been in the
Italian Embassy would be brought to a special reception center at
the town of Restinco, outside Brindisi.
   It was not clear where the French vessel would take its refugees.
   Albanian leader Ramiz Alia introduced some economic reforms and
social reforms this year, including allowing religious observances
and travel abroad, which Albanians have not been able to do for 45
years. The government also began to improve ties with other
countries and said it was considering establishing relations with
the superpowers.
   Since the turmoil at the embassies began, the government has
shaken up the ruling party Politburo and Central Committee. Several
hard-liners associated with the late Communist ruler Enver Hoxha
were dismissed.
   The Italian Foreign Ministry official said the shake-up
``favored this solution'' of the ferries.
   The official said he hoped that the adoption of internal reforms
in Albania would prevent another flood of asylum-seekers.

   Marvin Liebman, a founder of the modern
conservative movement, said today he decided to announce his
homosexuality in hopes that he can counter the homophobia he said
is rippling through right wing politics.
   Liebman, 66, revealed his homosexuality simultaneously in the
pages of William F. Buckley's conservative National Review and The
Advocate, a Los Angeles-based gay magazine.
   ``The primariy impact I wanted to have was on the conservative
community, to alert them to the dangers of homophobia and all that
comes with it,'' Liebman said in an interview today.
   At the same time, he said, he hopes he will be an example to
other gay people still living in hiding.
   ``The main thing I want to do within the gay community is to
help people come out _ to not go through all the crap I did for 60
years,'' he said.
   Liebman, who calls Buckley his best friend, announced that he
was homosexual in a letter to Buckley in the July 9 issue of the
National Review and in an interview in the July 17 edition of The
Advocate.
   To Buckley, he wrote, ``The conservative movement has room for
lots of different people, including gays.''
   Buckley _ who once suggested that gay people with AIDS be
tattooed on the buttocks _ responded that he understands Liebman's
pain, but asked if people should ``submerge convictions having to
do with that which we deem to be normal, and healthy?''
   Liebman said he feels no rancor toward Buckley even though they
disagree on whether homosexuality is moral or normal.
   ``There is nothing that Bill Buckley could say that would offend
me or make me feel bad,'' Liebman said today.
   Liebman, director of special projects at the Federal Trade
Commission, helped Buckley found the National Review and spent some
35 years involved in conservative causes. He helped found the Young
Americans for Freedom and was involved with the American
Conservative Union, the Conservative Party of New York and the
Goldwater and Reagan campaigns.

   The ``green cards'' issued to aliens living in the
United States henceforth be made in France, a French company
announced Wednesday.
   Thomson-CSF, a major manufacturer of military equipment, said it
had been selected by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service to produce a new generation of resident alien permits,
commonly known as green cards.
   ``The new system meets the demanding security and quality
standards for identity papers specified by the INS, with a view to
minimizing the risk of falsification, forgery and assumption of
false identity,'' Thomson said.
   No financial details of the deal were disclosed, and Thomson did
not say what company previously produced the cards.
   It said the new cards would be produced using advanced
electronic color imaging and digital processing techniques, so that
a color photograph of the individual and a black-and-white
photograph of the signature and fingerprints are processed together
onto the card.
   Thomson also produces identity papers for the French government.

   Here is a text of President Bush's remarks as he
commented and read from the concluding communique at the economic
summit:
   Well, I would say to my distinguished colleagues that we've had
a chance to review the declaration that was agreed this morning by
the eight of us, and I first want to thank all of you for the
spirit of full cooperation that I think we all agree existed here
in this summit.
   The eight of us, representing the people of France, the United
Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, Canada, Italy, Japan, the
United States and the European Community, all met. And our
declaration reflects decisions taken during the past three days
here in Houston, to extend our long economic expansion, strengthen
the world trading system, reiterate our support for the strength
and debt strategy, ensure open investment, assist reform in Central
and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, safeguard the environment,
help developing nations, and reduce the scourge of drugs.
   And on behalf of my colleagues, I'd like to note several points
of particular importance to us, summarizing _ not reading in its
entirety _ but summarizing some key points out of this declaration.
   
   We are enormously heartened by the resurgence of democracy
throughout much of the world. And we welcome the spread of
multi-party democracy, the practice of free elections, the freedom
of expression and assembly, the growing respect for human rights
and the rule of law, and the increasing recognition of the strength
of open and competitive economies. These events proclaim loudly
man's inalienable rights. When people are free to choose, they
choose freedom.
   We, the G-7, are now in the eighth year of an economic expansion
which has created millions of jobs, accelerated the growth of world
trade, and provided tangible support for developing countries.
   The process of economic policy coordination, which we have
developed over the years, has contributed importantly to this
economic performance. However, we cannot rest on current
accomplishments. Each of us will continue efforts, individually and
together, to maintain and improve conditions for growth.
   Economic prosperity depends critically on an open world trading
system. And we will devote close personal attention in the month
ahead to achieving a successful outcome of the Uruguay round of
multilateral trade negotiations.
   We have given our trade negotiators clear instructions on our
commitment to conclude a comprehensive agreement which expands
trade worldwide while bringing the greatest number of participants
into a strengthened General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
GATT. Each of us recognizes that reaching this goal will require
difficult steps by all participants. We will not hesitate to take
them. This is especially true for agriculture, where we are
committed, by this declaration, to provide the strong political
leadership necessary to ensure a successful and enduring result.
   We agreed on the significance of the steps under way in the
Soviet Union to liberalize and democratize its society, and to move
toward a market economy. We welcome President Gorbachev's message
to us, in particular his desire for a sustained economic dialogue
with the West. We want to support the reforms under way in the
Soviet Union, and all agree that technical assistance can help the
Soviets move toward a market-oriented economy. Some of us are
already prepared to extend large-scale credits to the Soviet Union.
   We all agree, however, all of us, that the Soviet Union could
greatly improve the prospects for sustained Western assistance if
it introduced further market reforms, cut its military spending and
ceased supporting governments which promote regional conflicts.
   We also took note of the importance to the government of Japan
of peaceful resolution of its dispute with the Soviet Union over
the Northern Territories. We see the need for a considered,
comprehensive Western response in support of Soviet reform efforts,
and we have asked the major international economic institutions to
provide us by year's end their recommendations for reform of the
Soviet economy and possible criteria for Western assistance.
   We are keenly aware of our responsibilities to pass on to the
future generations a world environment whose health, beauty and
economic potential are safeguarded. Environmental challenges such
as climate change, ozone depletion, deforestation, marine
pollution, and the loss of biological diversity require closer and
more effective international cooperation and action.
   We are united on the goals and measures to be taken now,
particularly in relation to climate change and the protection of
forests. And in this regard, we have agreed to complete by 1992 the
work of the IPCC on a framework convention on climate change; to
begin work immediately on developing a pilot project to address
tropical deforestation in Brazil; commence negotiations _ this is
the third point _ to commence negotiations on a global forest
convention or agreement to curb deforestation, promote
bio-diversity and encourage sound forestry practices and
reforestation.
   We recognize the difficult economic challenges facing many
developing countries, including reduced growth and severe debt
burdens. And we have been in the forefront of addressing these
problems and encouraged _ we are encouraged by the progress that
has been made under the international debt strategy over the past
year.
   We have agreed to review options for helping those countries
that are heavily indebted to our governments. Economic and
political reform are essential for economic prosperity and
political stability. For those countries undertaking these
difficult steps, we offer our experience, resources and good will.
   We leave Houston renewed by the strength of our common
commitments to healthy economic growth and prosperity and freedom
for peoples everywhere.
   And in conclusion, we have accepted Prime Minister Thatcher's
kind invitation to meet again next July in London.
   Again, my thanks to my colleagues.
   I think the plan is that we now go and have our own opportunity
to respond to questions from the press. But I want to thank my
colleagues for what I, at least, feel have been, has been a good
summit. And we're very pleased you were here. And I might I just
take one more opportunity to thank the people of Houston for their
hospitality. Thank you all very much.

   Here are excerpts from the final communique
issued by the leaders of the seven industrial nations at the
conclusion of their 16th economic summit.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Economic Declaration</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   1. We, the Heads of State and Government of the seven major
industrial democracies and the President of the Commission of the
European Communities, meeting in Houston for our annual Economic
Summit, celebrate the renaissance of democracy throughout much of
the world. We welcome unreservedly the spread of multi party
democracy, the practice of free elections, the freedom of
expression and assembly, the increased respect for human rights,
the rule of law, and the increasing recognition of the principles
of the open and competitive economy. These events proclaim loudly
man's inalienable rights: When people are free to choose, they
choose freedom.
   2. The profound changes taking place in Europe, and progress
toward democracy elsewhere, give us great hope for a world in which
individuals have increasing opportunities to achieve their economic
and political aspirations, free of tyranny and oppression.
   3. We are mindful that freedom and economic prosperity are
closely linked and mutually reinforcing. Sustainable economic
prosperity depends upon the stimulus of competition and the
encouragement of enterprise _ on incentives for individual
initiative and innovation, on a skilled and motivated labor force
whose fundamental rights are protected, on sound monetary systems,
on an open system of international trade and payments, and on an
environment safeguarded for future generations.
   4. Around the world, we are determined to assist other peoples
to achieve and sustain economic prosperity and political freedom.
We will support their efforts with our experience, resources, and
goodwill.

<HEAD>The International Economic Situation</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   5. In recent years, substantial progress has been achieved in
promoting a stronger world economy through sound macro economic
policies and greater economic efficiency. The economic expansion of
our countries, now in its eighth year, has supported notable income
growth and job creation in the context of rapid growth of
international trade. However, unemployment remains high in a number
of countries. Inflation, although considerably lower than in the
early 1980s, is a matter of serious concern in some countries and
requires continued vigilance. External imbalances have been reduced
in the United States and Japan, whereas in other cases they have
increased. Continuing adjustment remains a priority in order to
counter protectionist pressures, alleviate uncertainties in
financial and exchange markets, and contribute to avoiding
pressures on interest rates. Sound domestic macroeconomic policies,
which may differ according to conditions in each country, will make
a major contribution to further external adjustment.

<HEAD>Arizona Supreme Court Hears Challenge to Mecham Candidacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Impeached Gov. Evan Mecham was back in court
today, defending his right to run again for the office from which
he was removed in 1988.
   Mecham's candidacy is being challenged by Dennis Ingram, an
ex-highway patrolman who maintains that Mecham's impeachment and
subsequent conviction disqualified him from ever again seeking
public office in Arizona.
   The state Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the challenge
this morning.
   The Senate convicted Mecham in April 1988 of two of the charges
filed against him by the House, and voted 17-13 to invoke the
so-called ``Dracula clause,'' which would have banned him from
seeking office in the future.
   But under the rules of the impeachment trial, it would have
taken a two-thirds majority, or 20 votes, to invoke the clause.
   Arguments before the Supreme Court centered on language in the
constitution limiting the Senate to removal of the convicted
officer and disqualification from holding office in the future.
   Ingram's lawyer, Michael Meehan, argued that the language makes
both actions mandatory. But Mecham's attorney, Donald MacPherson,
said the language mandates only removal from office, and that
disqualification is discretionary.
   Vice Chief Justice Stanley Feldman acknowledged that the
constitutional language is unclear.
   ``Don't you think one could read this clause either way _ that
it is automatic or not?'' he asked. ``It's just not clear.''
   Both MacPherson and Lisa Hauser, who represented the attorney
general's office and the secretary of state, agreed that if the
court finds that the language is ambiguous that it must rule for
Mecham.
   Justice James Moeller told Meehan that had the Senate believed
that Mecham's convinction would have resulted not only in his
removal from office, but his permanent disqualification from
seeking office, there might have been a different verdict.
   ``How do we know what the vote would have been on impeachment
had they known it would forever bar?'' he asked.
   Chief Justice Francis X. Gordon Jr., who presided over Mecham's
impeachment trial, disqualified himself from hearing Ingram's
challenge.
   Feldman said the justices usually rule on such cases the same
day that arguments are heard. But he said the ruling may not come
that soon in this case and promised only that there would be a
decision ``as quickly as possible.''
   Mecham has said that he believes one of his opponents in the
September Republican primary is behind Ingram's challenge. Meehan
says Ingram acted ``as an individual'' and not on behalf of any
candidate. Ingram is a registered Republican, but is not known to
have been politically active in the past.
   With incumbent Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford not running, the
November election is wide open. Former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard
is considered the Democratic front-runner, and the Republican field
is split among five candidates.
   Mecham was convicted of misuse of money given to him by
supporters and obstruction of justice in a cover-up of an alleged
death threat made by an aide.

<HEAD>East German Defense Chief Warns Against Assumptions On NATO
Membership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's defense minister on Wednesday
warned against assuming that a united Germany will be a NATO member
and said only a joint German parliament can decide on its military
alignment.
   No NATO troops can be deployed in any case on what is now East
German soil, Rainer Eppelmann told East Germany's ADN news agency
in an interview.
   The future Germany's military alignment has been discussed in
the two-plus-four talks among the two Germanys and the four World
War II allies that defeated the Nazi dictatorship in 1945.
   Among those, the Soviet Union is resisting NATO membership for
what will be one of the mightiest military powers in central Europe.
   But the United States, along with France and Britain, maintain
the NATO alliance would be an effective watchdog over Germany
provided the newly united nation be a member.
   In the ADN interview, Eppelmann said the impression had gained
ground in recent weeks that ``many regard future NATO membership
for Germany as a done deal.''
   ``The ease with which many have mentioned `full NATO
membership,' as if nothing less would do, has made me worry that
the concerns and interests of our eastern neighbors aren't being
given all that much weight,'' he said.
   Eppelmann, whose official title is Minister of Defense and
Disarmament, said the question of NATO membership should be settled
after German unification by a newly elected all-German parliament.
   That would run contrary to the two-plus-four timetable, which
aims for the issue to be settled before a formal merger of the two
Germanys.
   Eppelmann added German membership in NATO should be tied to a
transformation of the military alliance into a political
organization renouncing the ``confrontational elements'' of its
strategy.
   No NATO troops, including the West German army, should ever be
deployed on East German soil, the conservative politician said.
   The Western allies have made similar suggestions in recent
months, and have also proposed that some American and Soviet forces
remain in their respective German zones for a certain period.
   Experts have predicted sheer logistics would stand in the way of
a full withdrawal of all foreign forces in less than four years.
   In the next two years, East Germany would reduce by half its
National People's Army of just under 100,000 active-duty troops,
and cut the number of ``main weapons systems'' by 25 percent to 50
percent, Eppelmann said.
   Together with West Germany's 465,000 soldiers, that would still
leave Germany with more than half a million troops.
   West German officials are ready to reduce the size of the joint
German armed forces, and sources say they will accept a limit of
400,000 or possibly less.

   It was hated, feared and flunked. But
soon the dreaded parallel parking test required of Florida drivers
will disappear.
   A straight-ahead parking test will replace the parallel parking
ordeal.
   ``Everybody hates it,'' state Senior Highway Safety Specialist
Joe Thompson said. ``It is a feared thing by many.''
   State officials decided to drop parallel parking from road tests
by Sept. 1 after six months of test programs at 15 sites, Thompson
said.
   The change comes after years of complaints calling the test
obsolete in the age of sprawling parking lots.
   The parallel parking test has also made nervous wrecks of many
trying to earn driving privileges _ no doubt another reason why
many have complained.
   ``From personal experience in the field, I would say it has to
be the Number One cause of failures on the road test,'' Thompson
said.

   Bush also said he expects political opposition in this country
to his goal of eliminating agricultural subsidies worldwide. Under
pressure from the United States, the summit agreed on a statement
establishing a goal of eliminating farm subsidies, despite European
opposition.
   The government spends more than $10 billion a year in direct and
indirect subsidies to American farmers.
   Bush opened the news conference with a statement saying the
summit partners are ``united in a common goal to extend (help) to
those who seek political and economic freedom.''
   He noted they agreed upon steps to boost the Soviet economic
reform effort, but several times sidestepped questions of when the
time might be right for direct U.S. assistance to the Soviets.
   Asked whether he would approve direct aid at the end of a
six-month International Monetary Fund study, he replied, ``not
necessarily.''
   At the same time, Bush said there was no reason for West Germany
and France to defer to the United States on the subject of direct
economic aid. Those two nations have said they favor giving aid to
Moscow.

   With his comments, Bush rang down the curtain on an
extraordinary week of post-Cold War diplomacy, beginning with last
week's meeting of NATO leaders in London and concluding with three
days of summit talks in the sweltering heart of Texas.
   In London, the western leaders offered a ``solemn commitment to
non-aggression'' to the Soviet Union and the new democracies of
Eastern Europe.
   In Houston, they went one step further, agreeing on the need for
assistance to give Gorbachev a boost in his effort to establish a
marketplace economy in his Communist land.
   On other issues, the summit partners:
   _Finessed the thorny issue of eliminating agricultural
subsidies. The final communique said the industrialized nations
have a long-term goal of ending subsidies.
   _Agreed to a pilot study to help save the Amazon rain forests.
But in a victory for the administration, they did not press for
specific targets for reducing the pollutants suspected of causing
global warming.

   A rancher who was a fugitive for two
decades pleaded innocent to charges that he masterminded an
international drug smuggling ring.
   Daniel James Fowlie, 56, entered the plea Tuesday to charges
including money laundering, income tax evasion and conspiracy to
smuggle 53,000 pounds of marijuana into the United States.
   A federal magistrate denied bail, calling Fowlie dangerous and a
flight risk.
   Fowlie's U.S. District Court trial was set for Aug. 28. If
convicted of all the charges, he could be sentenced to life in
prison and fined $2 million.
   Fowlie was extradited July 2 from a Mexico jail where he had
been imprisoned for three years on a U.S. warrant.
   Before that, authorities spent 20 years tracking him in Europe
and Central America.
   Prosecutors said Fowlie masterminded a marijuana- and
cocaine-smuggling ring from Rancho del Rio, a 213-acre ranch near
San Juan Capistrano. Narcotics agents seized the Orange County
ranch during a 1985 drug raid.
   Six of Fowlie's alleged associates, including sons Daniel Jr.
and Gus, have been convicted of drug charges.
   Fowlie was linked to drug guru Timothy Leary and a smuggling
ring known as the Brotherhood of Love during the 1960s, authorities
say.

   Rock star Madonna's ``Blond Ambition'' tour arrived
in Italy to a less-than-sellout crowd after weeks of protests
against her by Roman Catholic organizations.
   And she canceled a second planned performance in Rome because of
low ticket sales and a threatened general strike by labor unions.
   The show has angered the church and pro-family groups that
object to the lingerie-clad Madonna using a crucifix and other
Christian symbols during her sexually suggestive performance.
   Madonna, an Italian-American, tried to win over the concert
crowd Tuesday night by donning the No. 15 jersey of Italian soccer
star Roberto Baggio and by occasionally speaking Italian during the
show.
   Scalpers sold tickets at cost or less. Police estimate there
were 30,000 people at Flaminio stadium, which has a capacity of
32,000.
   ``The controversy has gravely damaged the take,'' said David
Zard, Madonna's promoter in Italy.
   The state-run RAI television network dropped plans to record the
concert for future broadcast.
   ``My blood boils when I am misunderstood and judged unfairly for
my convictions,'' Madonna said before the concert.

   The intriguing scar on the chin of movie star
Harrison Ford came from a mundane mishap. Years ago Ford smashed
his car into a pole as he reached for the seat belt while driving
to his job in a department store in Santa Ana, Calif.
   ``I hit the steering wheel, I think,'' Ford, 48, said in an
interview in the current issue of Vanity Fair.
   He said he crawled from the wreck and stood bleeding from his
chin. Other motorists ``would just creep around me at 5 miles an
hour and keep on going.''
   Someone finally stopped and took him to a hospital, where he
received ``not a very good job,'' he said.
   In a love scene with Melanie Griffith in ``Working Girl,'' the
Ford character first says the scar came from knife fight, then says
he fainted while piercing his earlobe and banged his chin on the
toilet.

   The Rolling Stones canceled a concert in Wales on
Wednesday night because lead guitarist Keith Richards has an
infected finger.
   ``The decision to cancel was apparently only made at midnight
when Keith consulted doctors. His septic finger was too bad for him
to play,'' said Stones' spokesman Neil Friedman.
   A crowd of 30,000 was expected at Cardiff Arms Park, the city's
national rugby stadium, as part of the band's Urban Jungle tour of
Europe.
   Promoter Harvey Goldsmith canceled the concert after doctors
advised Richards he risked permanent damage if he played.
   The guitarist reportedly accidentally cut himself on a knife.
   It was hoped Richards would be better in time for Friday's

   Ella Fitzgerald was nearly
recovered from exhaustion Wednesday but still needs several more
days of rest in a hospital before returning to the United States, a
spokesman said.
   The 72-year-old jazz great was taken to Bronovo Hospital Monday
after becoming ill in her hotel room. She was treated for
exhaustion and dehydration.
   ``Her condition has improved much over yesterday. She's sitting
up in her bed and eating and drinking normally,'' said Dr. Clifford
Booker, a physician and friend traveling with her.
   Miss Fitzgerald wears a pacemaker but her heart was not
affected, according to Booker.
   Her health problems forced cancellation of her European tour,
which was to begin Wednesday night at a gala in her honor at the
North Sea Jazz Festival in The Hague, and with appearances in
Montreux, Switzerland, and Antibes, France.
   Miss Fitzgerald's release date from the hospital had not been
set, according to Booker, who said she would then return to her Los
Angeles home.

   Olympic ice dancer Jayne Torvill
said Wednesday she's engaged to American sound engineer Phil
Christensen, who is touring with pop star Phil Collins.
   The 32-year-old skater said she met 35-year-old Christensen when
he worked on the Torvill and Dean ice show tour of the United
States last year.
   But she said their romance didn't begin until January when he
asked her for a date _ at a hamburger restaurant. Three months
later, he gave her a diamond engagement ring.
   ``I'm very, very happy,'' she told reporters here, where the ice
show is on tour.
   Torvill said work commitments meant they couldn't set a wedding
date.
   Christensen, from Chicago, is on tour until October with
Collins; the Torvill and Dean tour doesn't end until September.
   ``The show must go on,'' Torvill said.
   Torvill and skating partner Christopher Dean won a gold medal in
the 1984 Olympics and went on to perform their ice dance routines
all over the world.
   The engagement ended years of speculation over Torvill's
relationship with Dean, who told reporters he was overjoyed at her
engagement.
   ``We are very close platonic friends _ hopefully now people will
believe that,'' Dean said.
   ``It won't be the end of Torvill and Dean. When we are skating
we will do what we have always done. The love affair on ice will
continue,'' he said.

a shop he plans to open in September.
   See-through shirts, hip-hugger pants and one shoulder Lycra

clothing will be in stock or custom-ordered,'' said Jill Willis,
Prince's spokeswoman.
   Willis also said that a line of official Prince merchandise _
including T-shirts, sweatshirts, ``love symbol'' jewelry, photo
badges, calendars and posters _ may become available in department
stores.
   That project is still in its preliminary stages, ``which is

<TEXT>
   After three weeks of studying astrology charts
and occult books, police hit the streets Wednesday to await the
Zodiac gunman, who will strike after midnight if he follows his
pattern of the past four months.
   Twenty-one days ago, the letter-writing killer shot and wounded
a sleeping homeless man in Central Park, leaving behind a note. It
was the fourth time the Zodiac had struck; one of his victims died.
   The shootings all followed a 21-day pattern: the first occurred
March 8, followed by March 29, May 31 and June 21. The time between
the second and third shootings was 63 days, a multiple of 21.
   Each shooting has occurred early on a Thursday. The gunman has
vowed in his letters to police and news media that he will shoot 12
people _ one for each sign of the Zodiac.
   While police were out looking for the gunman, some wary New
Yorkers were staying inside. One census taker, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because he was afraid, said people were
refusing to cooperate with him after police suggested Tuesday that
the killer was getting people's birth dates through census forms.
   There are no questions about date of birth on the census, only
about year of birth and age, said U.S. Census Bureau spokeswoman
Deirdre Blackwood, who called police to complain about the comment.
   If the pattern continues, police believe the shooter is likely
to strike again sometime between 12:01 a.m. Thursday and dawn. A
police task force of 50 detectives has chosen sites where the
shooter is thought more likely to strike, and additional manpower
will be out around the city.
   Police refused to detail their plans or how the sites were
chosen, but theories about the gunman abound. Investigators have
probed the bizarre and offbeat in their efforts to anticipate the
next strike by the Zodiac, who shot three people on the
Brooklyn-Queens line and one in Central Park.
   Detectives reportedly studied a turn-of-the-century book called
``The Law is For All,'' which contains a series of revelations from
a deity named Aiwass.
   The 21st revelation in the Aleister Crowley book reads,
``Nature's way is to weed out the weak. This is the most merciful
way.'' Two of Zodiac's victims _ including the one who died _
walked with canes; another was shot while drunk, and the fourth was
wounded while sleeping.
   Another hypothesis involved the gunman superimposing the
constellation Orion over the city and shooting his victims to
correspond with its stars. Orion is the hunter in mythology, and
the Zodiac referred to himself as the hunter in a letter to police.
   The gunman claims to be the same Zodiac who terrorized San
Francisco during the late 1960s and early '70s, kiling six people.
Police doubt that, but think he may be getting his ideas from a
1986 book about the San Francisco attacks.
   Despite his self-promotional ways, the Zodiac remains a mystery
to police. Two sketches of the gunman, FBI psychological profiles
and 1,800 phone tips have so far turned up nothing. Fifty potential
suspects have all been cleared, police said.
   Despite the research and increased police patrols, Chief of
Detectives Joseph Borrelli acknowledges the best leads could come
after the killer claims another victim.
   ``The more times an incident occurs, the better the chance of
finding the individual,'' he said.

   The United States and its trading partners agreed
today to work toward a plan within the next two years to save the
world's forests from destruction, but papered over their sharp
differences on global warming in the interest of summit unity.
   President Bush hailed the stance taken by the seven-nation
economic summit on global warming as ``a reasoned position, not a
radical position that's going to throw a lot of American men and
women out of jobs.''
   He told a post-summit news conference that the save-the-forest
proposals were strongly supported by West Germany, which had been
the principal lobbyist for curbs on pollutants implicated in global
warming.
   Bush succeeded in keeping out of the final summit communique any
mention of European demands for target ceilings on emission of
polluting gases blamed for a gradual increase in the Earth's
temperature.
   The summit leaders declared that ``we as industrialized
countries have an obligation to be leaders in meeting these
challenges,'' including climatic changes, ozone depletion,
deforestation, marine pollution and loss of biological diversity.
   Environmental groups denounced the communique as a do-nothing
statement.
   ``Despite their green rhetoric, the ... leaders leave Houston in
the red on the environment,'' said the ``Envirosummit'' coalition
of prominent environmental groups.
   ``The summit is a failure on the environment because they did
nothing on global warming,'' said Dan Becker of the Sierra Club.
   However, the summit's agreement to devise a forestry action plan
could help the eventual easing of global warming because trees
absorb carbon dioxide, a major culprit among so-called greenhouse
gases.
   Scientist say 20 percent of global warming results from
deforestation.
   The United States agreed to join in working on ``appropriate
implementing protocols'' as quickly as possible to stem the warming
of Earth's temperature.
   U.S. officials said the protocols should consider all sources of
man-made gases and such mitigating measures as tree plantings.
   President Bush originally had said that these implementing
protocols should await an international agreement on global warming
in 1992.
   Meanwhile, at Bush's urging, the summit leaders agreed to begin
immediate negotiations on curbing worldwide deforestation. The
accord could include measures to prevent deforestation, replant
industrialized areas, train Third World countries in forestry
protection and discussions on control of acid rain and other
issues, U.S. officials said.
   The leaders said the forestry agreement should be ready for
signing by 1992.
   ``The destruction of forests has reached alarming proportions,''
the communique said.
   The summiteers also signed off on a deal struck Tuesday to
implement a plan within one year to save Brazil's tropical rain
forests, the officials said.
   Summit negotiators also debated a U.S. proposal to strengthen
the tropical rain forest rescue plan administered by the World Bank
and various United Nations groups. Environmentalists have
criticized the program a ineffectual.
   During talks by the summit partners, representing the United
States, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan,
environmental issues were overshadowed by trade, farm subsidies and
other matters, but there was general discussion of the so-called
greenhouse effect produced by air pollutants.
   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the agreement
included an urgent pilot project that would lead to a reversal of
the current destruction of rain forests. Officials said the World
Bank should oversee the project, but no cost estimates or other
details were disclosed.
   The decision to postpone action on global warming and hold a
study conference conforms with Bush's contention that more research
is needed before taking such dramatic steps to curb global warming.
   When the Economic Summit countries met a year ago in Paris, they
agreed to ``common efforts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases which threaten to induce climate change.''
Environmental groups have accused the United States of failing to
live up to that commitment.
   The European Economic Community on Tuesday challenged the Bush
administration to prove its contention that taking dramatic steps
to halt the warming trend will stall economic growth.
   Jan Laurens Brinkhorst, director of environmental matters for
the European Economic Community, said the facts do not bear out the
theory that curbing carbon dioxide emissions will slow economic
growth.
   Carbon dioxide is produced by the combustion of all fossil fuels.
   Brinkhorst said the world economy grew by 25 percent between
1973 and 1986 while energy consumption remained flat.
   Economists agree, he said, that energy use could be reduced 15
percent to 20 percent in the course of a decade without major
economic disruption.
   ``I would hope to see, in a serious way, the Europeans and
Americans compare notes and actually see what is true, (whether)
you would have this tremendous difficulty in your economic
performance if you would do something more'' about carbon dioxide
emissions, Brinkhorst said.
   Carbon dioxide has been estimated to account for about 55
percent of global warming, but the timing and the degree to which
the earth is expected to become hotter are uncertain.

   Western leaders urged the Soviet Union on
Wednesday to overhaul its sputtering economy, offering ``meaningful
and sustained'' aid if Moscow reduces military spending and
eliminates subsidies to communist allies like Cuba.
   After three days of tough debate, the Group of Seven reached an
11th-hour compromise to reduce agricultural subsidies and avoided a
showdown on global warming.
   It was a landmark economic summit, the first since democracy
swept through Eastern Europe and began to take hold in the Soviet
Union.
   ``Wherever people are free to choose, they choose freedom,''
Bush said.
   In a political endorsement, the leaders of the world's seven
richest nations hailed Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to salvage the
battered Soviet economy and adopt democratic reforms. The leaders
offered immediate technical assistance and commissioned a study of
Soviet needs, but President Bush said he wasn't ready to offer
direct U.S. aid.
   Dangling a carrot before Gorbachev, the leaders said prospects
for ``meaningful and sustained economic assistance'' would be
enhanced by Soviet decisions ``to introduce more radical steps
toward a market-oriented economy, to shift resources substantially
away from the military sector and to cut support to nations
promoting regional conflict.''
   ``Maybe this can lead'' to American cash support, Bush said,
adding ``I wouldn't set a time frame on when and if the United
States decides to go forward.''
   He pointedly said, ``I'm not enthusiastic about the
intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at U.S. cities'' and he
said he found $5 billion a year in Soviet aid to Cuba ``a little
contradictory.''
   According to a Rand Corp. study, the Soviets provide $5 billion
a year to Cuba, $1 billion to North Korea, $1.5 billion to Syria,
$1 billion to Libya and $2.5 billion to Viet Nam _ countries the
administration accuses of promoting conflict in their regions. The
Soviets also aid Afghanistan and Angola in civil wars.
   Not everyone was happy with the U.S. position or the study,
which will take half a year to do.
   Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti said, ``We are on the
front line as Europeans and maybe we can help the United States
understand why we want to help the Soviet Union ... When someone is
ill, you don't want to wait for medicine.''
   Bush described the the G-7 policy on Soviet aid as ``an effort
to encourage forward motion and be helpful.'' He said he would
brief Gorbachev on the summit results and had already sent a
preliminary cable.
   The various summit compromises were satisfying to Bush. He wrote
the summit's script for aid to the Soviet Union, won a face-saving
deal on trade and managed to hold off European demands for
aggressive action on the environment.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd acknowledged there had
been some hard words. ``But it will be a more successful summit
than if everybody had come here determined to sing from the
beginning a unified hymn of praise,'' he said.
   The summit shelved proposals from West Germany and France for a
coordinated $15 billion aid package for the Soviets but urged that
technical assistance, such as transportation and banking experts,
be dispatched to help Moscow ``mobilize its own resources.''
   The G-7 leaders said each country was free to send cash on its
own, and several were sure to do so. The West Germans have made a
$3.1 billion loan package designed in part to soothe Soviet
concerns about reunification.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he regarded the summit
position on aid to the Soviet Union to be ``strong backing'' for
him when he visits Moscow next Sunday and Monday.
   Kohl is working with the Soviet Union in trying to arrange
German unification. The Soviets still have 380,000 troops in East
Germany. The Bonn government has already expressed its willingness
to assume all the East German trade and financial obligations to
Moscow.
   The Group of Seven _ the United States, West Germany, France,
Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada _ are the world's wealthiest
democracies and Wednesday their leaders pronounced themselves
pleased with the West's economic health. Celebrating ``the
renaissance of democracy throughout much of the world,'' the
leaders offered this outlook:
   The upbeat language of the final communique masked sharp
differences on trade and the environment. Compromises were struck
on both subjects to allow everyone to claim victory, or at least
harmony.
   Against opposition from European leaders, Bush fought for the
eventual elimination of farm subsidies to clear the way for an
ambitious global free trade pact.
   A British source said the compromise _ the result of all-night
bargaining _ was ``sufficient to get the Americans on board but
does not go too far so it drops anybody off the other end.''
   The final agreement called for across-the-board cuts in all
categories of farm subsidies. However, it also contained a European
demand that it be allowed to add up its subsidies by using a
measuring device which the United States had opposed.
   On the environment, the European leaders decided not to press
Bush for specific ceilings on gas emissions widely blamed for
global warming of the envirnoment. Instead, they agreed to work on
steps to stem global warming ``as expeditiously as possible.'' The
U.S. position is that more study is required to determine the
causes of the problem.
   The leaders agreed to begin negotiations immediately to curb
deforestation. And they approved a plan to save Brazil's tropical
rain forests.
   Environmentalists decried the outcome.
   ``President Bush has lulled the other G-7 leaders into an
environmental sleep that abandons their commitment to advance
solutions to the world's most pressing ecological problems,'' said
George Frampton Jr., president of the Wilderness Society. Other
environmental leaders echoed his remarks.
   On the economic front, the leaders noted that unemployment and
inflationary pressures remained at unacceptably high levels in some
countries but it offered no solutions other than a promise to
continue their close cooperative efforts at managing the global
economy.
   The summit leaders also repeated past pledges to fight the
scourge of drug trafficking and to continue support for efforts to
reduce the oppressive $1.3 trillion debt burden being carried by
the Third World.

   The world's richest democracies wrapped up their
annual summit today, setting conditions for sending ``meaningful
and sustained'' financial aid to the Soviet Union and agreeing to
reduce worldwide agricultural subsidies.
   The last-minute trade compromise finessed a nasty dispute over
farm subsidies.
   The summit urged that Western technical assistance be dispatched
immediately to help Moscow ``mobilize its own resources,'' and the
leaders ordered a study to recommend ways to target future aid.
   President Bush, in a wrapup news conference, said the moves on
Soviet aid were ``an effort to encourage forward motion and be
helpful.'' Bush said he would brief Gorbachev on the summit results
and had already sent a preliminary cable.
   In a final communique, the seven leaders called on the Soviet
Union to ``shift resources substantially away from the military
sector'' and to ``quit support'' for satellite states and nations
involved in regional conflicts.
   ``Maybe this can lead'' to direct cash support from the United
States, he said. But Bush said ``I'm not enthusiastic about the
intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at U.S. cities,'' and
said he found $5 billion a year in Soviet aid to Cuba ``a little
contradictory.''
   Others were ready to move ahead. ``We are on the front line as
Europeans and maybe we can help the United States understand why we
want to help the Soviet Union,'' said Italian Prime Minister Giulio
Andreotti. ``When someone is ill, you don't want to wait for
medicine.''
   Satisfied with their 11th-hour compromises on farm subsidies and
the environment, the leaders quickly concluded their 16th annual
summit this morning.
   ``This was a summit that addressed itself to a rapidly changing
world,'' Bush said.
   Trade negotiators reached reached a compromise agricultural
agreement in the early hours today and the seven heads of
government spent just a half-hour reviewing the document before
giving their approval at their final session at Rice University.
   The United States insisted on language calling for
across-the-board cuts in all categories of farm subsidies. But the
agreement also contained ambiguous language acceptable to the
reluctant Europeans, urging each nation ``to make substantial,
progressive reductions.''
   The farm dispute had threatened to disrupt the annual gathering.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd acknowledged there had
been some hard words. ``But it will be a more successful summit
than if everybody had come here determined to sing from the
beginning a unified hymn of praise.''
   In a self-congratulatory final communique to be read by
President Bush at the close of the talks, the world leaders patted
themselves on the back for a global economy that was still chugging
along, although at a decidedly slow pace.
   The summit leaders noted that unemployment and inflationary
pressures remained at unacceptably high levels in some countries
but it offered no solution for the economic problems other than a
promise to continue their close cooperative efforts at managing the
global economy.
   The communique also agreed to a pilot-study to help save the
Amazon rain forests, but in a victory for the administration, did
not press for specific reduction targets for the pollutants
suspected of causing a global warming of the environment.
   The final communique basically recycled many of the
environmental pledges made by the same countries at last year's
summit session in Paris.
   The summit leaders also repeated past pledges to fight the
scourge of drug trafficking and to continue support for efforts to
reduce the oppressive $1.3 trillion debt burden being carried by
the Third World.
   A passage on Soviet aid was sure to cause reverberations because
an aide to Mikhail Gorbachev, Georgy Shakhnazarov, had said in
advance that preconditions to Western aid were unacceptable. ``We
aren't taking orders,'' he asserted.
   But Bush said he was optimistic about Gorbachev's response.
``I'd like to think he's going to try.''
   The final statement read this way:
   ``We also agreed that further Soviet decisions to introduce more
radical steps toward a market-oriented economy, to shift resources
substantially away from the military sector and to quit support to
nations promoting regional conflict will all improve the prospect
for meaningful and sustained economic assistance.'' The last
passage was a thinly disguised reference to Cuba.
   A Rand Corp. study says the Soviets provide $5 billion a year to
Cuba, $1 billion to North Korea, $1.5 billion to Syria, $1 billion
to Libya and $2.5 billion to Viet Nam _ all of whom the
administration accuses of promoting conflict in their regions.
   The leaders said, ``We all agree that technical assistance
should be provided now'' to help Moscow ``mobilize its own
resources.'' Stressing that aid should begin immediately, the
leaders tacitly gave a green light to West Germany which already
has announced a $3.1 billion loan package.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he regarded the summit
position on aid to the Soviet Union to be ``strong backing'' for
him when he visits Moscow next week to negotiate terms of German
unification.
   The Soviets still have 380,000 troops in East Germany. The Bonn
government has already expressed its willingness to assume all the
East German trade and financial obligations to Moscow.
   On the farm issue, Bush and his summit partners pledged to
``maintain a high level of personal involvement and to exercise the
political leadership to ensure the successful outcome'' of a
96-nation effort to overhaul the global trading system.
   The talks, known as the Uruguay Round for the country where they
were launched in 1986, are viewed by the administration as offering
America its best chance to reduce its staggering trade deficits by
expanding export opportunities for farmers and businesses.
   European nations were fighting Bush's proposal to phase out $245
billion in farm subsidies over the next decade, contending that
would eliminate the jobs of 3 million European farmers.
   In addition to the United States, the other countries
participating in the three days of talks in Bush's sweltering
hometown were Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and
Canada.
   Aid to Moscow was the overriding issue during the leaders first
post-Cold War summit. In advance, Gorbachev had written the summit
in a bid for aid and asking for a greater role in international
market institutions. The Soviet economy is so weak that there are
concerns that Gorbachev would not survive without serious
improvements.
   The summit leaders agreed to help Moscow, but could not develop
a coordinated approach. They rejected calls by West Germany, France
and Italy to put together a $15 billion aid plan, opting instead to
order a study under the direction of the International Monetary
Fund to assess what aid would be of most use to the Soviet economy.

<HEAD>Forest Service Says Forest Concert Too Close to Spotted Owls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pair of northern spotted owls is causing
problems for environmental groups who want to hold a concert in the
forest.
   The U.S. Forest Service says the event would disturb two spotted
owls near the concert site. The fifth annual Concert in the Forest
is set for Aug. 24-26 in the Willamette National Forest, 60 miles
southeast of Portland.
   Sponsors include Friends of the Breitenbush Cascades and Friends
of the Cathedral Forest. Both groups are active in the fight to
protect old growth forests, the habitat of spotted owls, from
logging.
   Jim Farrell, a Willamette National Forest biologist, said
recently that a survey turned up a breeding pair of spotted owls
with two owlets 1,000 to 1,500 feet south of the concert site.
   The northern spotted owl will be listed as a threatened species
under federal law on July 23. U.S. Fih and Wildlife guidelines for
protecting the owl prohibit activities such as the concert near
nests, Farrell said.
   However, environmentalists say the music is primarily acoustic.
And they contend that the crowd, which has reached 700 in past
years, will not pose a threat to the owls.
   ``It's an ironic slap to use the owl as a pretext to stop a
low-impact event,'' said Mark Ottenad of Friends of the Breitenbush
Cascades.
   Sponsors said they would go ahead with the concert whether or
not they receive the required Forest Service permit. The event has
been widely publicized in newsletters and outdoor magazines.
   Sponsors have rejected three alternate sites. The preferred site
is close to trails and offers views of the cascading South
Breitenbush River and many types of forest _ from young reforested
stands to centuries-old groves.

   With the Communist Party's top job safely in his
pocket once more, it was time for Mikhail S. Gorbachev to relax and
have some fun with his comrades on Wednesday.
   Gorbachev has been attacked by party traditionalists and radical
reformers during the party's 28th congress. In return, he showed
his pedagogical side, lecturing the army of gray-suited bureaucrats
_ the largest group of delegates _ on the wisdom of his views.
   Tuesday morning he lectured on the need for change, stabbing his
hands in the air and letting his voice slide into the soft accents
of southern Russia as he does when he speaks extemporaneously.
   Later in the day he handily won re-election as party leader, and
he appeared much more relaxed at Wednesday's session.
   Taking control of the congress after a break, a smile broke
across Gorbachev's broad face as read a brief note.
   ``Please congratulate Anatoly D. Kravchenko on the birth of a
son, an heir, on the 10th of July,'' the note said. The congress
applauded loudly.
   ``He just learned about it with us,'' Gorbachev continued,
referring to Kravchenko.
   Gorbachev put forward a proposal when the hall continued to buzz.
   ``Are we going to discuss what to call the son or not?'' he
asked the congress. ``And then vote on it?'' he continued to the
roar of laughter.
   Before the break, Gorbachev had rescued the congress as it
rumbled toward chaos under the unsteady hand of Ayaz Mutalibov, the
party leader of Azerbaijan.
   Gorbachev disappeared from the dais less than 20 minutes into
the meeting Wednesay morning, but Mutalibov ran into trouble
keeping order, and discipline crumbled.
   Just as the delegates were squabbling noisily about whether to
vote on a floor resolution whether to dismiss the government for
failing to meet miner's demands, Gorbachev strode on stage to put
the show in order.
   He apologized for his absence. ``You should understand, I have
to be here and there,'' he said.
   Within minutes he called a recess to cool off the congress.
   He was generous to the delegates, giving them more and longer
breaks than usual. He also appeared magnanimous with his foes.
   Gorbachev rebuffed efforts to put an age limit on candidates for
the post of deputy party leader, a move that if passed would have
excluded Yegor K. Ligachev, Gorbachev's toughest Politburo critic.
   At one point he gently reminded Ligachev of the name of a
delegate he had forgotten, rather than let him stumble. In earlier
sessions, he had not hesitated to cut off opponents when the debate
was not going his way.

   Black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela,
who reportedly has pneumonia, cut short a visit to Ethiopia on
Wednesday and flew to Kenya where he arrived looking weary and sick.
   Mandela arrived on a charter flight with his wife, Winnie. The
71-year-old African National Congress leader walked slowly down the
airplane stairs to the runway and used both hands to clutch the
stair rail and support himself.
   After greeting President Daniel arap Moi and his Cabinet, and
waving to a small crowd of airport workers and security officials,
Mandela and Moi climbed into the president's limousine and were
driven away.
   Mrs. Mandela left in a separate vehicle.
   The Star newspaper of Johannesburg said Mandela had contracted a
slight case of pneumonia and was seeking treatment in Nairobi.
   However, a member of Mandela's entourage, contacted at Moi's
official residence, said Mandela got a slight cold while in
Ethiopia and was resting.
   ``I can assure you he is not at any hospital,'' said the aide,
who refused to identify herself. She would not reveal Mandela's
whereabouts.
   Mandela, who was in Ethiopia for the annual Organization of
African Unity summit, cut short that part of his trip by one day to
fly to Nairobi aboard a special plane provided for him by President
Hassan Ali Mwinyi of Tanzania.
   One hospital and one diplomatic source said earlier that Mandela
had been admitted to Nairobi Hospital. A hospital official, when
asked if Mandela had been there, would only say the ANC leader had
not been admitted.
   The Star newspaper, which has a correspondent traveling with the
ANC leader, reported on Wednesday that Mandela had caught a cold
while in Ireland and it developed into pneumonia.
   The paper quoted aides as saying the pneumonia was slight and
there was no cause for alarm, but that he would seek treatment in
Nairobi.
   Concerns about Mandela's health have arisen several times during
his six-week tour through North America, Europe and Africa. Several
times he has had to postpone or cancel planned events due to
fatigue.
   He underwent surgery in June to have a benign cyst removed from
his bladder. Doctors also have expressed concern about his heart.
   Mandela generally has been reluctant to draw back from a
punishing schedule of political talks and foreign tours since his
release from prison in February.
   Mandela was jailed for 27 years for opposing South Africa's
white-led government. In 1988, he was hospitalized for tuberculosis.
   After Kenya, he was to stop in Mozambique before returning to
South Africa in time for his 72nd birthday on July 18.
   Mandela arrived from Addis Ababa nearly three hours late,
forcing Moi to make two trips to the airport.
   There were no welcoming speeches.

<HEAD>Mitchell Moves to End Trade Status for China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell moved
Wednesday to cut off President Bush's favored trade treatment for
China, saying the administration's hopes for improved human rights
have proved futile.
   Bush notified Congress on May 24 that he was renewing
most-favored-nation trading status and its preferential tariff
treatment for Chinese goods.
   The status took effect July 3 _ exactly 13 months after the
government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in and
around Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   But Mitchell, D-Maine, said that means China ``has no incentive
to improve its human rights record or to keep its commitments as a
citizen of the international community of nations.''
   Mitchell, with 16 other Democratic and Republican senators,
introduced a bill that would roll back the preferred trading status
until the president certifies that political prisoners in China
have been freed, free emigration is granted, surveillance of
Chinese students abroad is halted and religious persecution is
stopped.
   The certification also would have to assert that press freedom
has been restored, pro-democracy leaders aren't being persecuted
and internationally recognized human rights are being honored.
   While it's likely the bill could win majority support in the
House and Senate, it's far less probable it can win the two-thirds
vote needed to overcome an almost certain presidential veto.
   Mitchell said he was introducing the bill ``to give tangible
expression'' to what he called Americans' overwhelming support for
the dormant Chinese pro-democracy forces.
   Bush, Mitchell said in a Senate floor speech, has adopted a
policy of waiting and hoping for improvements in human rights.
   ``Waiting and hoping has not changed the policies of the Chinese
government,'' Mitchell said.
   Awarding most-favored-nation status, he said, ``rewards the
Chinese government for a year of political arrests and executions,
a year of intensive public security controls, a year of continued
arms sales to the Mideast, a year of restrictions on foreign
journalists in China and harassment of Chinese students residing in
the United States.''
   ``The hope for freedom in China is as remote today as it was a
year ago,'' Mitchell said.

^International Monetary Developments and Policy Coordination</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At a time of growing economic interdependence, the Summit
countries have developed a cooperative process based on a common
appreciation of the need for market-oriented policies and the
importance of sound domestic budgetary and monetary policies. This
process has contributed importantly to the strengthened performance
of the world economy and to improved stability of exchange rates by
concentrating attention on multilateral surveillance and close
coordination of economic policies, including cooperation on
exchange markets. ...
   Countries with sizable current account deficits should
contribute to the adjustment process by the reduction of fiscal
deficits, and undertake structural reforms to encourage private
savings and increase competitiveness. ...
   Countries with large external surpluses should contribute to the
adjustment process by sustained non-inflationary growth of domestic
demand with structural reform in order to improve the underlying
conditions for growth and adjustment and to promote increased
investment relative to saving.
   The investment needs of the world as a whole are expected to
grow in the coming years, particularly in Central and Eastern
Europe and in developing countries undertaking market reforms, as
well as in some industrial countries. To meet these needs,
industrial and developing countries alike should foster saving and
discourage dissaving. ...
   We welcome the prospect of a unified, democratic Germany which
enjoys full sovereignty without discriminatory constraints. German
economic, monetary, and social union will contribute to improved
non-inflationary global growth and to a reduction of external
imbalances. This process will promote positive economic
developments in Central and Eastern Europe.
   We call on the member countries of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to implement the agreement by the IMF to increase quotas
by 50 percent under the Ninth General Review of Quotas and to
strengthen the IMF arrears strategy.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Measures Aimed at Economic Efficiency</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We emphasize the widespread need for further steps to promote
regulatory reform and liberalize areas such as retail trade,
telecommunications, transport, labor markets, and financial
markets, as well as to reduce industrial and agricultural
subsidies, improve tax systems, and improve labor-force skills
through education and training.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The International Trading System</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The open world trading system is vital to economic prosperity. A
strengthened General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is
essential to provide a stable framework for the expansion of trade
and the fuller integration of Central and Eastern Europe and
developing countries into the global economy. We reject
protectionism in all its forms.
   The successful outcome of the Uruguay Round has the highest
priority on the international economic agenda. Consequently, we
stress our determination to take the difficult political decisions
necessary to achieve far-reaching, substantial results in all areas
of the Uruguay Round by the end of this year. ...
   We confirm our strong support for the essential broad objectives
of the negotiations; reform of agricultural policies; a substantial
and balanced package of measures to improve market access;
strengthened multilateral rules and disciplines; the incorporation
of new issues of services, trade-related investment measures, and
intellectual property protection within the GATT framework; and
integration of developing countries into the international trading
system. ...
   As regards agriculture, achieving the long-term objective of the
reform of agricultural policies is critical to permit the greater
liberalization of trade in agricultural products. ...
   We therefore reaffirm our commitment to the long-term objective
of the reform, i.e., to allow market signals to influence
agriculture production and to establish a fair and market-oriented
agricultural trading system. ...
   The achievement of this objective requires each of us to make
substantial, progressive reductions in support and protection of
agriculture -- covering internal regimes, market access, and export
subsidies -- and develop rules governing sanitary and phytosanitary
measures. Variations among countries in the mechanisms of
agricultural support reflect differences in the social and economic
conditions of farming. The negotiations on agriculture should
therefore be conducted in a framework that includes a common
instrument of measurement, provides for commitments to be made in
an equitable way among all countries, and takes into account
concerns about food security. The framework should contain specific
assurances that, by appropriate use of the common measure as well
as other ways, participants would reduce not only internal support
but also export subsidies and import protection in a related way.

   To the kids in the working-class
neighborhood of Villa Don Bosco, it was like a giant puzzle: How to
fit the paving stones back into the torn-up street just the way
they were.
   It was going slowly.
   The stones had been used by backers of a massive Sandinista
strike to make barricades, tying up this capital of 1 million. In a
few neighborhoods they had been taken down Wednesday and piled
neatly alongside the ruptured streets, available to be used again.
   But on the northern highway, the main entry to Managua, barriers
of burning cars and the Maltese cross-shaped stones remained.
   Army bulldozers pulled them down and left. Police stood by as
strike supporters rebuilt them. In some cases police even directed
the reconstruction.
   ``With so many people, what can we do?'' shrugged a member of
the Sandinista-controlled police. He said their orders were,
essentially, to keep the feuding sides apart.
   Radio Sandino, the voice of the Sandinista National Liberation
Front, is a drumbeat of accusations that the strikers are under
attack by backers of the government of President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro instead of being the instigators. There are dark hints of
an American invasion.
   North of Managua protesters felled large trees across highways
and rolled boulders onto the road. One bore the black-painted
message, ``Everything Will Be Better,'' the Sandinista campaign
slogan of last February's elections in which the Sandinistas lost
the presidency.
   At the edge of the capital police stood by as protesters threw
four-pronged spikes known as ``Miguelitos,'' or ``little
Michales,'' under the wheels of moving vehicles. Pro-Sandinistas
with megaphones tried to whip up the crowds, urging them to ``stand
fast.''
   In some poorer neighborhoods squads of men in red-and-black
Sandinista caps and scarves, armed with AK-47 assault rifles,
prowled the unpaved streets checking identities of strangers.
   It has been 11 years since the last Sandinista uprising but
clearly, they haven't forgotten how.
   The paving stones are still called ``Somoza stones'' by some. In
the 1979 uprising that toppled dictator Anastasio Somoza,
barricades of the stones played a key role in allowing the
Sandinistas to hang onto control of much of the city.
   Somoza owned the factory that produced them.
   Weapons are increasingly in evidence in Managua. There are few
shoppers in the public markets, gasoline is hard to find, and
hundreds of businesses are closed because people can't get through
the barricades to go to work.
   Reliable information hardly exists these days and rumors fly
like shrapnel across the hot, muggy lakeside capital.
   Wednesday's biggie was that the airport, closed by a strike of
traffic controllers, might open.
   About 50 people were there Wednesday morning, some having spent
the night on the marble floor.
   But there were no planes coming or going.
   Zurita Winzeler, 25, a naturalized American citizen who left
Nicaragua for Miami in 1983, had come back to Nicaragua for a
wedding and got caught by the strike.
   ``We're just waiting for the first flight out, we don't care
where,'' she said.
   ``We thought things would be better here under Chamorro. But the
Sandinistas are still the ones running the show.''

   However quarrelsome, the Western industrial
giants took a historic and probably irreversible turn at their 16th
economic summit toward a permanent post-Cold War relationship with
the Soviet Union.
   President Bush and his six partners agreed Mikhail Gorbachev was
entitled to their assistance. They argued over details: How much?
How soon? What in return?
   But they agreed on immediate technical assistance and dispatched
a study team to recommend how to target future aid. They gave West
Germany the green light to complete a $3.1 billion loan, and aid
from the others will surely follow.
   Overall, it is a giant leap toward trust after decades of Cold
War suspicion and brinksmanship.
   The summit urged Gorbachev to take ``more radical steps'' to
shift billions now spent on the Red Army and on Cuba into the sad
Soviet domestic economy. He's probably planning to do this anyway
in his drive to improve living conditions and hold to the levers of
power.
   If Gorbachev succeeds in this, he stands to gain ``meaningful
and sustained economic assistance,'' the windup summit communique
said.
   It was the West's second philosophical swing within a week. Not
as dramatic perhaps as NATO's decision to reduce its reliance on
nuclear weapons, the rendering of first technical and then probably
more direct assistance can't help but draw East and West even
closer.
   ``Coming after last week's very successful NATO summit, which
took a major stride towards a more peaceful world, the results of
thee meeting in House are an important step towards a more
prosperous world for everyone,'' British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher said at a news conference.
   A senior U.S. official who has played a prominent role in
framing administration policy put it this way:
   ``There is a potential for a new economic relationship between
the Soviets and the industrial West. I wouldn't say the
relationship is there yet. But what Gorbachev gets out of this
summit is a clear, unequivocal affirmation of the belief of the
Seven that it is incumbent upon the West to help perestroika
succeed.''
   Reflecting, the official concluded: ``What this says is that
we're serious about this. We would not be going through this effort
and analysis otherwise.''
   Unthinkable only last July, when Gorbachev knocked on the summit
door and was brushed aside as a Communist intruder, the United
States, Britain, France, West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada have
themselves crossed a threshold.
   They emerged from this year's summit in sun-baked Houston,
itself a testimony to nervy free enterprise, dedicated to
perestroika and committed to invest in Gorbachev's success.
   ``There's a common determination that we have to respond very
positively to Mr. Gorbachev's request for a sustained economic
dialogue between the Soviet Union and the Group of Seven,''
Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark said.
   In declaring nuclear weapons a highly unlikely last resort, the
NATO allies in their 41st year moved beyond containment toward one
Europe.
   In committing themselves to help Gorbachev in ``practical
ways,'' the summit leaders blurred the 45-year divide between
capitalism and communism.
   At the start, the industrialized democracies will take measured
steps, beginning with a study conducted by bankers and other
experts of the inefficient Soviet economy and the tentative moves
by Gorbachev over his five years in power toward free-market
reforms.
   The study, under the supervision of the International Monetary
Fund, is supposed to be completed by December _ although officials
at the World Bank said a year would be more like it.
   In the meantime, a tide of technical assistance is likely to
flow West to East.
   At this stage, Bush is reluctant to go further. He wants the
Soviets to cut military spending, abandon Cuba and convert to a
genuine free-market system. The summit agreed, and so if these
conditions are met, Bush may brave political fire from his right
and propose more significant U.S. aid.
   ``I don't think you should ever say never,'' Secretary of State
James A. Baker III said Tuesday in refusing to permanently rule out
direct U.S. aid.
   And will Gorbachev be pleased with the results of this summit?
   ``I think he will find in the response a positive encouragement
to persist in his reforms, and that seems to us all the essential
point,'' Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, concluded.

   Leaders of the world's seven richest democracies
today reached a last-minute compromise on government payments to
farmers in hopes of giving a push to stalled efforts to overhaul
the world trading system.
   President Bush and the other leaders, winding up their annual
economic summit, endorsed the compromise language in a short
morning session. The deal between the United States and its
European trading partners had been arranged during an all-night
bargaining session among negotiators.
   Bush said at a mid-day news conference he hoped the compromise
would help efforts to reach a broad international trade agreement
in negotiations that have been going on for four years.
   The summit agreement called for across-the-board cuts in all
categories of farm subsidies, as demanded by the United States, but
it also contained less specific language that was more acceptable
to the Europeans.
   Bush acknowledged that ``there will be some political
opposition'' in the United States to phasing out subsidies at home.
But when asked if he would press for such action, he said,
``Absolutely. We have to do it.''
   Noting that no quick action was expected in Europe, he said of a
U.S. effort, ``That's a little down the road.''
   The final language in the communique urged each nation ``to make
substantial, progressive reductions'' in the areas of export
subsidies, internal price supports and barriers to imports.
   The compromise also contained a European demand that it be
allowed to work out a formula to measure, and then reduce, a
variety of farm subsidies. This measuring mechanism had been
opposed by the Americans.
   The leaders pledged to maintain ``a high level of personal
involvement'' to bring a successful end to the Uruguay Round of
international trade talks in December.
   The farm fight had been a major focus in the three days of talks
between the heads of government of the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Britain. The summit was held on
the campus of Rice University. The sessions were also attended by a
representative from the 12-nation European Community.
   ``We consider the text in general as a satisfactory outcome of
this meeting,'' said a community official, demanding anonymity.
``Everybody has got something out of it.''
   A British official hailed the farm agreement and said Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher believed it would mean a successful
windup of the world trade talks.
   Bush had made achieving progress on farm subsidies a top
priority at this year's summit, believing that without movement on
farm subsidies an ambitious effort to rewrite the rules governing
world trade could be doomed.
   The United States has a lot riding on the 96-nation Uruguay
Round talks. The president has said they offer the best hope of
expanding export opportunities for U.S. farmers and businesses and
thus reducing America's huge trade deficits.
   Bush spoke forcefully during the sessions but he faced strong
resistance from European countries, who contended that his
insistence on complete elimination of all trade-distorting farm
subsidies could end up costing the jobs of up to 3 million farmers.
   The leaders had extended their afternoon session on Tuesday for
an extra 90 minutes, grappling with the farm subsidy issue, finally
sending lower level negotiators off to work through the night in an
attempt to come up with compromise language.
   The draft agreement specifically mentions reductions in the
three areas of farm subsidies targeted by the United States for
cuts. These include export subsidies, internal price supports and
barriers to imported goods.
   The United States had insisted that the areas be spelled out in
any agreement, despite opposition from the European Community.
   But in an effort to bridge the gap between the two sides, the
agreement also refers to the community's more general approach to
cutting subsidies which employs a technical yardstick to measure
subsidy levels.
   The global trade negotiations, which opened in 1986 in Uruguay,
are due to wind up with a final round of hard bargaining in early
December in Brussels, Belgium.
   European Community officials have long fought to protect their
expensive export subsidies. They contend that getting rid of the
program would translate into higher farm prices in Europe and
result in the loss of jobs for millions of farmers.
   The program gives exporters help so more high-priced European
farm products can compete with lower prices on the world market.
The United States has responded by setting up its own Export
Enhancement Program.
   American officials also have pressed the community to open its
markets wider to foreign farm products and reduce farm payments
that encourage overproduction of crops.
   The Uruguay Round is being held under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a forum and agreement for
promoting freer trade.

<HEAD>Farmers Carry Out Threat of Nationwide Road Blockade, Angering
Drivers</HEAD>

   Farmers ignored motorists' jeers and
blocked roads nationwide Wednesday with tractors, trucks and
combines to try to pressure the government into guaranteeing
minimum farm prices.
   ``All main highways have been blocked with farm machinery,''
police spokesman Aleksander Chyl said shortly after the start of
the two-hour protest organized by the farmers union Rural
Solidarity.
   All 49 provinces were affected, including the road to the main
border crossing with the Soviet Union at Brest, PAP said. In
addition to highways, many local streets were blocked. Police did
not interfere.
   Although the protest appeared largely successful, there were no
signs that the government intended to retreat from its refusal to
grant minimum prices.
   The roadblocks were the latest challenge to the Solidarity-led
government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who in recent
months has grappled with strikes by farmers and rail workers and a
stream of criticism from Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa over his
tough economic policies.
   In an attempt to smooth relations with workers, Mazowiecki met
for two hours Wednesday with a blue-collar delegation from the
Gdansk shipyards. Union members there accuse the government of
forgetting its roots and not explaining itself to the people who
elected it.
   On the main Warsaw-Poznan road just west of Warsaw, promptly at
noon farmers rolled four tractors, a truck and a delivery van
decorated with white-and-red Polish flags across the highway.
   Traffic piled up for a half-mile almost immediately. Some
frustrated drivers turned around and others parked their vehicles
and sat in a roadside restaurant.
   Some drivers yelled at the farmers.
   ``Who's going to pay this bill?'' stranded driver Mariusz
Maciejeski shouted, referring to his lost time.
   ``If this were 20 years ago, during Communist times, you would
be hanging from a tree,'' said an outraged retiree, who hit Rural
Solidarity chairman Gabriel Janowski on the shoulder.
   Janowski remained calm and appealed to motorists for sympathy.
   ``I hope you understand what this is all about. This is our only
form of protest,'' he told one couple headed on vacation with their
children. They had shouted an epithet at him.
   A few of the drivers did sympathize.
   ``It's not very pleasant to sit here for two hours, but in my
opinion the farmers are right _ nobody listens to them,'' said
Mariusz Wojciechowski of Suwalki in northeastern Poland.
   Janowski's Rural Solidarity is independent of the Solidarity
trade union movement under Walesa, although the unions were broadly
allied in the fight against communism. Walesa is on vacation and
planned no statement on the farmers' protest, his office said
Wednesday.
   Janowski said the protest was justified despite some concessions
granted farmers this week. He said guaranteed minimum prices were
as necessary for farmers as a national minimum wage is for workers.
   Poland's 2.5 million private farmers have been among the groups
most harshly affected by the Mazowiecki government's ``shock
therapy'' to reform the Polish economy. Higher consumer prices have
sharply limited the market for their crops and dairy products, and
the big cooperatives that buy from them are on the brink of
bankruptcy, squeezed by high interest rates.
   On Monday, the Cabinet acknowledged the farmers' difficult
situation and made several conciliatory gestures, including
lowering interest rates on farm loans and providing emergency funds
to allow dairies to pay off debts to farmers.
   But the government has refused to give in to the demand for
government-set minimum prices, saying that would run counter to the
basic principle of establishing a market-based economy.
   The government twice has had to resort to force in the past
month to counter farm protests, first to unblock the main road
between Gdansk and Warsaw and then to end a three-day sit-in at the
Agriculture Ministry.

   The Soviet Union welcomes efforts by the leading
capitalist powers to create a new model of economic cooperation
between East and West, a Soviet spokesman said Wednesday.
   Speaking at a regular news briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov said his country welcomed new approaches that
``correspond to the spirit of the times.''
   Gerasimov's comments were reported by the Tass news agency.
   Wrapping up a three-day summit meeting in Houston, Texas, the
leaders of the seven largest capitalist economies urged that
Western technical assistance be dispatched immediately to help the
Soviet Union ``mobilize its own resources.''
   They ordered a study to recommend ways to ensure that any future
aid will be useful.
   President Bush said he would brief Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on the results of the summit, and had already sent a
cable to him.
   France and Germany have urged a large aid package to Gorbachev
to bolster his reforms, but other countries expressed doubts
whether the Soviet Union could use the aid effectively.
   Gerasimov added that the Soviet Union also backed appeals by the
capitalist powers for negotiated settlements to the conflicts in
Afganistan, Cambodia and Angola.
   He said the Soviet Union regretted a paragraph in summit
documents on the Soviet Union's dispute with Japan over the Kurill
Islands.
   The Soviet Union took control of the islands after World War II,
and both sides consider them to historically be part of their
territory. The two countries never have signed a peace treaty
ending hostilities in World War II because of their differences
over the islands.
   ``The Soviet Union favors concluding a peace treaty with Japan
that, naturally, will cover the geographic aspect,'' Gerasimov
said. ``But talks to conclude such a treaty are part of bilateral
relations and therefore we regard the attempt at internationalizing
the question of the so-called Northern Territories as
counterproductive.''

   A woman whose dog died during a four-hour
flight delay has sued two airlines for $13 million, charging that
the animal was left in the cargo hold on a hot summer day.
   Mary Elizabeth O'Brien of McLean, Va., filed the lawsuit Tuesday
against Piedmont Airlines and USAir. The lawsuit claims her
purebred chow chow, Maxwell, was kept in the cargo area of a
Piedmont Airlines plane at Baltimore-Washington International
Airport during part of a four-hour delay for mechanical repairs
July 12, 1987.
   The high temperature at the airport that day was 94 degrees.
   The woman contends she reminded Piedmont employees of the high
temperature, asked them repeatedly to be sure the dog had water and
sufficient ventilation, the lawsuit said.
   USAir merged with Piedmont last year.
   Dave Shipley, USAir spokesman, said Tuesday that the company
does not comment on lawsuits.

<HEAD>Treasury: Debt Limit Must Be Raised or Government Will Default</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government likely will default on its debt
for the first time next month unless Congress raises the limit
before leaving Aug. 6 on its month-long recess, the Treasury
Department warned on Wednesday.
   ``Treasury's current estimates show that the permanent ceiling
of $3.12 trillion will be sufficient only until mid-August,''
Treasury Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber told the House Ways and
Means Committee.
   The nation's debt topped the $3 trillion mark last April and by
Monday had surpassed $3.09 trillion.
   While Glauber did not say how much of an increase was needed
immediately, he did provide estimated ceilings for the next three
fiscal years to guide congressional and White House budget
negotiators as they continue their budget-cutting talks.
   ``We estimate that a debt limit of $3.51 trillion will be
sufficient'' to last through the 1991 fiscal year that begins Oct.
1, he said. Current estimates indicate a need for ceilings of $3.81
trillion through fiscal 1992 and $4.05 trillion through fiscal 1993.
   Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., expressed anger that the Bush
administration was planning to add hundreds of billions of dollars
to the national debt.
   ``He's the president of the United States, he's convinced the
voters they don't need to pay for anything, we can just keep on
borrowing,'' Gibbons said. ``My answer to him is, `No.'''
   Another panel member, Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., asked Glauber
if he felt ``a twinge of hypocrisy'' asking for increased borrowing
at a time that the administration is supporting a constitutional
amendment requiring a balanced budget.
   ``No,'' he replied.
   Glauber testified that without an increase in the debt limit
before the congressional recess, it is likely the Treasury will run
out of cash and borrowing authority and efault on $20 billion of
notes maturing on Aug. 15 and interest payments totaling about $21
billion due that day.
   ``Also, the United States most likely could not honor, on Aug.
3, $3 billion of military retirement and salary payments or
payments totaling over $11 billion to Social Security and
supplemental security income recipients, railroad retirees and
veterans,'' he added.
   Glauber also repeated Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's
warning last month that the government's estimates are uncertain
because of difficulty in predicting the cash needed to bail out the
savings and loans industry.
   The government narrowly averted its first default last November
when Congress raised the debt limit from $2.8 trillion for the
fiscal year ending Sept. 30. It also had come close to default on
several other occasions.
   The national debt has more than tripled since the beginning of
the decade as the Treasury was forced to borrow more and more money
to finance government spending that exceeds tax receipts.
   The annual deficits have gone down from their peak of over $200
billion a year, but the deficit still totaled $152.1 billion in the
year ending last Sept. 30. It totaled $151.68 billion after the
first eight months of the current fiscal year and some analysts say
it could return to the $200 billion level again by year's end.

   New York University President John Brademas,
credited with transforming the university from a commuter school to
a national university, will step down next year, officials said
Wednesday.
   Brademas, who came to NYU in 1981 after 11 terms as a Democratic
congressman from Indiana, will step down as president in December
1991, said NYU spokesman Virgil Renzulli.
   He would officially retire in March 1992 at age 65, after a
nearly three-month sabbatical.
   Brademas would become president emeritus and help the university
raise money and develop its international programs.
   ``Under his tutelage NYU basically went from a commuter school,
with most of our students coming from the metropolitan New York
area, and became a major national research university,'' Renzulli
said.
   During his tenure, Brademas recruited top faculty members and
saw enrollment soar to about 40,000 students. He also helped raise
$800 million and increase the university's endowment from $287.5
million to $540 million.
   To ease his departure, the responsibilities of NYU Chancellor L.
Jay Oliva, considered a likely successor, have been expanded to
include oversight of campus construction and the implementation of
new programs.
   Laurence A. Tisch, chairman of the NYU trustees, said the board
hopes to name a new president before Brademas leaves.
   The university, founded in 1831, employs 12,000 people, has an
annual budget of $1.1 billion and offers more than 25 degrees.

   Seven people cited for improving the lives of the
mentally retarded were named winners Wednesday of the 1990 Joseph
P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation Awards in Mental Retardation.
   The winners are former Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., of
Connecticut (Human Service Award); Edward Zigler, Ph.D., of Yale
University (Scientific Leadership Award); the Kingsley family of
Chappaqua, N.Y. (Special Achievement Award for Families); Paul
Wehman, Ph.D., of Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Va.,
and Marty Wyngaarden Krauss, Ph.D., of Brandeis University, Waltham
(Future Leaders in Mental Retardation Award).
   The awards will be presented at a ceremony Sunday in Hyannis
Port celebrating the 100th birthday of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy.
   Three women will also receive the first Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy
Leadership Award for work in the field. Their names will be
announced Sunday. The award includes a $15,000 prize.
   Weicker, who has a child with Down's syndrome, wrote legislation
mandating educational services to all handicapped pre-school
children, wrote the initial Americans with Disabilities Act and led
the passage of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. He
will be awarded $15,000.
   Zigler, who also wins $15,000, wrote groundbreaking books on
child development and early childhood education.
   The Kingsley family includes Jason, 16, an actor on ``Sesame
Street'' who has Down's syndrome; his mother, Emily, who wrote the
acclaimed ``Kids Like These'' television program in 1987; and his
father, Charles, who has served on many committees devoted to
improving the lives of the handicapped. They will share $5,000.
   Krauss is the director of the Starr Center for Mental
Retardation at Brandeis.
   Wehman developed the concept that with on-the-job support,
mentally retarded people can be productive employees in private
industry.
   Krauss and Wehman will share a $2,500 prize.
   The foundation, which has given the awards seven times since
1962, is named for Joseph and Rose Kennedy's eldest son, who died
during World War II. Their daughter, Rosemary, is mentally retarded.

   Free flows of investment increase global prosperity by
complementing the open international trading system. In particular,
foreign direct investment can help restructure the economies of
developing and Central and Eastern European countries, create new
jobs, and raise living standards. All countries should therefore
seek to reduce their barriers to investment and resist
protectionist pressures to discourage or discriminate against such
investment. ...

<HEAD>Reform in Central and Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We welcome the political and economic reforms taking place in
Central and Eastern Europe. At the recent Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Bonn and by the agreement to
establish the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD), the participating countries of the region accepted the key
principles underpinning market economies. However, the degree of
implementation of economic and political reform varies widely by
country. Several countries have taken courageous and difficult
measures to stabilize their economies and shorten the transition to
a market economy. We and other countries should assist Central and
Eastern European nations that are firmly committed to economic and
political reform. Those providing help should favor countries that
implement such reforms. Foreign private investment will be vital in
the development of Central and Eastern Europe. Capital will flow to
countries with open markets and hospitable investment climates.
Improved access for their exports will also be important for those
Central and Eastern European countries that are opening up their
economies. Western governments can support this process by various
means, including trade and investment agreements. The recent
decision by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export
Controls (COCOM) to liberalize export controls is a positive step.

<HEAD>The Soviet Union</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We discussed the situation in the Soviet Union, and exchanged
views regarding the message that Soviet President Gorbachev sent us
several days ago on his economic plans. We welcome the efforts
underway in the Soviet Union to liberalize and to create a more
open, democratic, and pluralistic Soviet society, and to move
toward a market-oriented economy. These measures deserve our
support. The success of perestroika depends upon the determined
pursuit and development of these reform efforts. In particular, we
welcome President Gorbachev's suggestion for a sustained economic
dialogue.
   We have all begun, individually and collectively, to assist
these reform efforts. We all believe that technical assistance
should be provided now to help the Soviet Union move to a
market-oriented economy and to mobilize its own resources. Some
countries are already in a position to extend large scale financial
credits. We also agreed that further Soviet decisions to introduce
more radical steps toward a market-oriented economy, to shift
resources substantially away from the military sector and to cut
support to nations promoting regional conflict will all improve the
prospect for meaningful and sustained economic assistance. We have
taken note of the decision of the European Council in Dublin on
June 26.
   We have agreed to ask the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD and the
designated president of the EBRD to undertake, in close
consultation with the Commission of the European Communities, a
detailed study of the Soviet economy, to make recommendations for
its reform and to establish the criteria under which Western
economic assistance could effectively support these reforms. This
work should be completed by year's end and be convened by the IMF.
   We took note of the importance to the Government of Japan of the
peaceful resolution of its dispute with the Soviet Union over the
Northern Territories.

<HEAD>Report Says Medicare Losing Millions in Double Payments for Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Medicare program pays at least $400
million annually for medical services that should instead be
covered by private insurance plans, a federal official told a
Senate subcommittee Wednesday.
   Michael Mangano, a deputy inspector general at the Department of
Health and Human Services, testified the money is being lost
because the Medicare program does not ensure that companies that
insure people who also receive Medicare pay the primary cost of
their medical bills.
   He estimated the annual loss at between $400 million and $600
million based on 1988 data, but added, ``that is a very
conservative estimate.''
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., ranking member of the Senate
Government Affairs' investigations subcommittee, said other
estimates put the loss as high as $1 billion a year and called the
problem ``absolutely astounding.''
   ``It gives lie to claims that the federal government needs to
raise taxes to make its budgetary ends meet,'' said Roth. ``Until
we get our house in order on the waste, fraud and abuse that cost
the taxpayers so dearly, we have no right to ask these same
taxpayers to shell out even more in taxes.''
   Mangano said his office has recommended that the Health Care
Financing Administration, which handles Medicare, improve efforts
to determine when beneficiaries are also covered by private
insurance. Although HCFA has taken some actions, agency officials
``have not eliminated the problems,'' he said.
   The $105 million Medicare program helps pay the medical expenses
for about 34 million Americans who are 65 and older or are disabled.
   The subcommittee focused on one insurance company _ Provident
Life and Accident Insurance Co. _ which Roth said ``allegedly
followed a deliberate policy of evading payments on claims of
patients they had insured by foisting these claims off on
Medicare.''
   The inspector general's office recommended government action
against the company, but the Justice Department declined to
prosecute ``due to manpower shortages'' and because other remedies
were available, Mangano said.
   Larry Simmons of the inspector general's office said the inquiry
and internal company memos show Provident's strategy appeared to be
that ``they would not pay until someone told them to.''
   Winston W. Walker, president of the Chattanooga, Tenn.-based
insurance company, testified that the blame was Medicare's alone.
   ``Our company was prepared to pay as primary payer,'' but its
efforts to determine how much and when to pay a claim were
``rebuffed'' by Medicare officials, he said.
   He said Medicare has no procedures to identify beneficiaries
with other insurance coverage before it pays a claim.
   Medicare and an insurance plan often both paid benefits to
health-care providers or beneficiaries, he said. Medicare then
expected the recipient to volunteer to repay Medicare the amount
overpaid, he said.
   ``Provident did not cause this breakdown, and Provident cannot
fix it,'' Walker said. ``Only the government can fix it, and then
only by implementing rational administrative procedures.''

   The sound of music is a silent one for
Audrey Stevenson, but that won't stop her from singing her kind of
music at the Miss New York State Pageant this week.
   The 20-year-old Stevenson is the first deaf contestant ever in
the Miss New York State Pageant. She is one of 17 women vying to
become the successor to the reigning Miss New York, Lisa Molella,
Saturday night in Watertown.
   Stevenson, a civilian postal clerk at the U.S. Army's Fort Drum,
enters the state pageant as Miss Thousand Island, a title she won
in part by singing in sign language.
   ``It's hard not to be moved by her talent,'' said Sharon
Cantwell, director of the Miss Thousand Island pageant.
   Stevenson turned down an opportunity to compete in the
preliminaries for the Miss Deaf America pageant for a chance at the
Miss New York crown.
   ``It's very important for me to be in this pageant. I want
hearing people to understand better the world of a deaf person. I
want to show other deaf people that they can realize their goals,
too,'' said Stevenson, who is accompanied by an interpreter
although she speaks clearly on her own.
   Clear enough, in fact, that she delivered a graduation speech to
local eighth-graders last month.
   ``Her deafness has never been a handicap. She's always done
precisely what she wanted,'' said her mother, Margaret Scougal.
   Stevenson has been deaf since she had meningitis when she was 18
months old.
   The 5-foot-7, 112-pound contestant has blue-green eyes and sandy
brown hair. One of her dreams has always been to compete in a
pageant.
   ``This year I just decided `I'm going to do it. It's now or
never,'' said Stevenson.
   Stevenson ``blew away the judges with a strong, opinionated
interview,'' recalled Cantwell. Then she stole the talent segment
by signing the words to ``I Hear Your Hands,'' a song she had first
performed at her high school graduation.
   As the runners-up were being announced and Stevenson's name
wasn't being mentioned, Scougal said she was preparing what she
would say to comfort her daughter. Words that never needed saying.
   ``I was so amazed that I won because it was the first time,''
said Stevenson, who clapped and looked around the stage for several
seconds until she realized the master of ceremonies had announced
her name as the winner.
   Stevenson is planning to repeat her signing song at the state
pageant, with some minor alterations and enhanced choreography.
   The national pageant had its first deaf contestant last year,
Jennifer Wall, Miss Washington, said Bill Caligari, stage producer
for the Atlantic City extravaganza. She was one of the 10 finalists.

   First Lady Barbara Bush, who lost a daughter to
leukemia, visited young cancer patients Wednesday while other
summit spouses toured different parts of a sprawling medical
complex.
   On the final day of the three-day economic summit, the spouses
went to the Texas Medical Center, which is made up of hospitals and
medical schools.
   At the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Mrs. Bush first talked to
adults receiving anti-cancer drugs in the center's ambulatory
treatment center, the world's largest facility for outpatient
chemotherapy.
   She then visited two children in their rooms before going to see
a group of youths attending summer school as they receive
outpatient treatment at the hospital.
   ``Wow, what a day, what a weird day,'' said 5-year-old Eric
Edelmann.
   Many of the children wore caps on their heads to hide the hair
loss they've suffered from chemotherapy treatment and several were
attached to intravenous tubes.
   The Bushes' daughter, Robin, died at age 3 of leukemia in 1951.
   Mrs. Bush specifically asked to see Denis Lokter, a 15-year-old
cancer patient from the Soviet Union who came to the hospital for
treatment several months ago.
   ``We had a wonderful visit from your president,'' she said,
referring to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's recent trip to the
United States. Lokter, who speaks limited English, said later he
did not know much about politics.
   Mrs. Bush wished happy birthday to Patrick Chapman, who turned 7
Tuesday, and asked him to open his mouth for a quick inspection.
Patrick is missing a front tooth.
   ``You have one enormous tooth. Where's the other one?'' she
asked. ``Certainly, it's going to have a friend, isn't it. They're
going to call you Fang.''
   Mrs. Bush told reporters she felt the spouses attending the
summit were impressed with the city.
   France's Danielle Mitterrand, Canada's Mila Mulroney, Italy's
Livia Andreotti, and Japan's Sachiyo Kaifu also went to the medical
center Wednesday.
   England's Denis Thatcher, the only male spouse, did not go to
the center. Hannelore Kohl, wife of West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, and Marie Delors, wife of European Commission President
Jacques Delors did not accompany their husbands to Texas.
   Mrs. Mitterrand toured the Texas Heart Institute, watched a
presentation on pediatric AIDS at Texas Children's Hospital and
went to the Houston Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children.
   Mrs. Mulroney also toured the Texas Heart Institute and the
Texas Children's Hospital, where she talked to doctors about
current research and treatment for cystic fibrosis. She also met
with some teen-agers with cystic fibrosis.
   Mrs. Andreotti visited a cholesterol research laboratory at The
Methodist Hospital and sampled some low-cholesterol Italian food at
the hospital's heart-healthy gourmet restaurant. She also met
doctors from the Texas Heart Institute and St. Luke's Episcopal
Hospital.
   Mrs. Kaifu met with famed heart surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey and
saw some of his pioneering inventions for heart surgery. She also
met heart transplant recipients.

<HEAD>Arkansas State Attorney General Charged With Theft by Deception</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state attorney general was charged
Wednesday with theft for allegedly entertaining political allies
and friends at taxpayers' expense.
   Steve Clark, 43, who in February withdrew from the race for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination because of the allegations,
pleaded innocent to the charge.
   After a brief court appearance, he said, ``My only statement is,
I am innocent of the charge against me and I do not to intend to
resign.''
   The charge followed a ruling by Little Rock Municipal Judge
Marion Humphrey that there was probable cause to charge Clark with
one count of theft by deception. His ruling was based on a 55-page
affidavit submitted by Pulaski County Prosecutor Chris Piazza.
   Bond was set at $2,500. The felony charge carries a maximum
penalty of five to 20 years in jail and a $15,000 fine upon
conviction.
   The case was sent to circuit court for trial.
   The affidavit accused Clark of covering up his use of a
state-issued Visa card for personal meals by submitting names of
people who did not dine with him. He also claimed to discuss state
business at the meals when private matters were discussed, the
affidavit said.
   The affidavit listed 86 allegedly improper transactions totaling
$8,448.27. Fifty-six were allegedly for private meals charged to
the state.
   Among them were a $713 party in Memphis, Tenn., which included
$613 worth of alcoholic beverages charged to the state. Included
were four $125 bottles of Dom Perignon champagne.
   Three of the four people listed by Clark as guests _ including
Arkansas State University President Eugene Smith _ said they didn't
attend. The purchase of alcohol at taxpayers' expense in prohibited
by state law.
   The affidavit also said Clark charged the state for a meal with
his mother, reporting to the state's finance department that he met
with officials to discuss improvements to a state highway.
   Clark said in January the errors were made when he tried to
itemize his expenses 60 or 90 days after the fact. He blamed the
discrepancies on sloppy bookkeeping. The attorney general is not
required by state law to itemize his expense claims; Clark said he
wanted to be more accountable.
   Clark has been attorney general since 1979.

   Here is the text of President Bush's news
conference Wednesday at the seven-nation Economic Summit:
   President Bush: Well, thank you all very much. And I have a
brief opening statement, and then I'll be glad to respond to your
questions.
   My colleagues from France and the United Kingdom, Germany,
Canada, Italy, Japan, and the European Communities and I have just
completed this 16th meeting of the leaders of the largest
industrialized democracies. And this, the first economic summit of
the postwar period, celebrates the resurgence of democracy and free
markets around the world.
   Over the past three days, we've had full discussions on the key
issues of our time: advancing political and economic freedom;
promoting sustained economic growth, both in developed and
developing countries; assisting the transition to market economies
in Central and Eastern Europe, and indeed in the Soviet Union; and
protecting the environment.
   We are united in a common goal: to extend to those who seek
political and economic freedom a helping hand with our resources,
talents, and experience. As our declaration states, ``when people
are free to choose, they choose freedom.''
   We identified the successful completion of the Uruguay Round of
global trade talks as one of the highest economic priorities, and
we recognized that agreement on fundamental reform of agriculture
is critical to achieving this goal. We commended the report by the
chairman of the GATT _ the GATT Agricultural Group, the De Zeeuw
report to our negotiators as a vehicle to move these talks forward.
And we also committed to maintain our personal involvement and to
exercise political leadership at every step along the way as we
move toward the final ministerial meeting in December.
   On the Soviet Union, we discussed our common efforts to assist
the Soviet reform effort, the success of which is in our common
interest. In addition to offering the Soviets technical assistance,
we've asked the IMF to coordinate a major study of the Soviet
economy and make recommendation for its reform. In keeping with the
agreements reached here, I will be conveying to President Gorbachev
the results of our deliberations.
   We achieved major progress on the environment, particularly on
climate change and forests. We committed to finish the negotiations
on a framework climate change convention by 1992. In a first, we
agreed that implementing protocols should consider all sources and
sinks of greenhouse gases consistent with the comprehensive
approach that we recommend.
   We agreed to launch a special effort to address the
deforestation in the rain forests, a concern that was very
forcefully raised by Chancellor Kohl. And I found a very receptive
audience for my proposal that a free-standing global forest
convention be negotiated without delay, and we agreed to move ahead
on this rapidly.
   In short, this was a summit that addressed itself to a rapidly
changing world. We agreed to welcome, respond to and manage the
changes on behalf of free markets, free political systems and a
better life for people everywhere. It is no small achievement that
we came to a positive and unanimous conclusion on so many important
and difficult issues. And I would stress those two words: positive
and unanimous.
   And I want to congratulate my colleagues on the results of the
collective effort. I think they left feeling good. We had a very
generous letter to our Secretary of State just now received from
Prime Minister Mulroney, and he's a veteran of these summits.
   And I must say to the Canadians here, I, once again, benefited
from his _ not only his commitment _ learned from his commitment on
certain issues like the environment _ but benefited from his advice.
   I also want to thank the two secretaries who were at my side,
Secretary Baker and Secretary Brady, Ambassador Carla Hills,
Secretary Yeutter, Secretary Mosbacher, who worked with their
colleagues and others at this summit. I want to thank the sherpas _
most of them stayed up _ I understand they all stayed up to 4 this
morning in ironing out this final communique. So, it was a team
effort, and I think most of our _ well, I think all of our summit
participants left feeling good about this particular summit.
   And now, I think Terry Hunt has the first question.

   What is believed to be the last hand-cranked,
magneto-operated telephone party line in the United States is
hanging it up after six decades, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
   The 20-party, single line system runs for 40 miles, strung on
trees, fence posts and treacherous cliffs high above the Salmon
River in an isolated section of east-central Idaho in the Salmon
River National Forest.
   The line, operated by the non-profit North Fork Telephone Corp.,
was installed by the U.S. Forest Service in 1931 and sold to users
for $1 in 1952.
   In its place will be a $250,000, state-of-art digital system
operated by the Rural Telephone Co. of Glenns Ferry, Idaho, said
the department's Rural Electrification Administration, which
provided financing for the new system.
   One of the old system's last customers, Garry Pedrow, said he
hated to see the change, because of the system's historical value,
but ``as far as being in business, it's hard to communicate on this
line.''
   His wife, Peggy, agreed.
   ``Once it's gone, it's gone forever. But ... I guess I'm ready
because I can't hear anything'' on the 40-mile party line.
   The size of the system will almost triple immediately to a total
of 37 subscribers, the REA said.
   A buried cable is the heart of the new system, most of it along
a narrow, dead-end roadbed, the only way _ other than the river _
in and out of the 40-mile canyon.
   The first call, scheduled for early Friday, is to be made from
Shoup's Country Store and post office, run by the Pedrows in the
canyon's only town, population 2.
   Joe Miller, president of the Idaho Public Utilities Commission,
was scheduled to make the ceremonial call to Gary C. Byrne, REA
administrator, who will be attending a rural development conference
in Denver.
   The REA began making rural electric loans in 1935 and was
authorized by Congress in 1949 to develop a similar program for
telephones. Since then, the agency has approved $8.9 billion in
direct and guaranteed loans for more than 1,000 telephone systems.
   REA spokesman Jim McKenna said nearly all rural hand-cranked
magneto telephones were converted to modern versions by 1970. At
the peak, he said, perhaps 1.25 million had served the nation's
farms, by conservative estimates.
   When they were installed decades ago, most hand-cranked phones
were wall-mounted units with a black metal mouthpiece on an arm and
a receiver hung on a two-prong hook on the left side.
   A crank on the right side rang bells along the line, and _ if
one persisted in cranking _ in a ``central'' office where an
operator took care of calls to town numbers or long-distance.
   Each farm had a coded ring _ two longs and a short, for example.
The customer being called was supposed to answer that ring and
ignore the rest.
   But party line chatter, with two or three parties talking and
several more secretly listening, was a popular rural recreation,
long before electricity, television and even radio.
   A ``line call'' of continuous ringing was often used to alert
families of emergencies such as approaching storms, tornadoes, or
fires in forest areas and on the prairie.

<HEAD>HOUSTON: First question.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about Soviet aid. Is this
six-month study of Soviet needs a way of delaying a political
decision on aid? Or at the end of that, will the United States make
a commitment to send some cash to Moscow?
   A: Well, it's not an effort to delay anything. It is, as we said
in the report, a step towards assisting the reforms. And I'll make
clear to President Gorbachev that he ought to view this outcome of
this summit very positively. You may remember that in London only a
few days ago, I gave my views on the U.S. lending money at this
time. So, it's not an effort to forestall anything, it's an effort
to move forward and encourage forward motion and be helpful to the
Soviet Union in terms of reform. They need much, much more reform,
and they're the ones that say this.
   And in Gorbachev's letter, he asked for assistance in many areas
_ personnel management and how they change their systems _ and
we've already started bilaterally, as have other countries, in
trying to assist. So, it's really a coordinated effort to help the
Soviet Union.
   Q: Well, in six months then can Mr. Gorbachev expect that the
United States will be sending some financial assistance to meet
these needs?
   A: Not particularly. Not necessarily. But, what he can expect is
that we will have been helpful to him in the reforms that he knows
that he has to undertake. And maybe, you know, this _ this could
lead to support. But there are things that have to happen. And I've
been very up front with him personally and then in public
statements as to what has to _ what has to happen for the United
States to send money.
   And, incidentally, I don't _ I'm trying to think on the
Gorbachev letter. I don't think there was a request for sending
money. And then, I also told our Soviet partners that we had some
problems, legal problems _ the settlement of this Kerensky debt,
for example _ before we would be free to give more, like direct
financial support. So, I wouldn't set a time frame on when and if
the United States decides to go forward.
   But I must say that I hope he will _ I hope the Soviets will
view this as positive. And, indeed, I have contacted Mr. Gorbachev
already by cable telling him I want to talk to him about the
summit, and telling him that _ why I felt that it's positive, and
also congratulating him on his landslide win. Certain readings I
was doing before then, I wasn't sure that it was going to work out
quite that way. But he's in the political arena, and he did pretty
darn well, and I congratulated him. Helen?
   Q: Mr. President, for 40 years, we've spent untold billions to
fight the Soviet Union. Is it conceivable, as you and Secretary
Baker have portrayed, that the U.S. _ American taxpayer would not
be willing to spend a dime to help them now?
   A: We are trying to help them now. And I think we're going to
send the kind of help that in the long run will be most beneficial
to them. And they need reform, and they know it, and we're going to
try in every way to facilitate that reform because we are in a very
different age. But we have some problems. I'm not particularly
enthusiastic about the intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at
US cities. I find it a little contradictory to think that they will
continue to spend $5 billion a year for Cuba, a totalitarian system
whose leader is swimming against this tide of democracy and freedom
that is lifting up most hopes in the Soviet Union. So, there's _
certain things have to happen before I, as president, will make
recommendations for direct financial aid. So, what we're trying to
do is carry our part of the load in helping the reforms.

   The United States and its partners at the
economic summit sidestepped differences on global warming
Wednesday, but issued an environmental declaration that emphasized
forestry protection.
   The seven leaders pledged to negotiate an international
agreement to curb deforestation as expeditiously as possible.
   The environmental declaration contained mostly general language
on global warming and called for an international convention on the
subject to be completed by 1992. The United Nations is already
working on the issue.
   The Bush administration prevailed in blocking European wishes to
specify exactly how much the industrialized nations should reduce
carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming.
   Carbon dioxide has been estimated to account for about 55
percent of global warming, but the timing and the degree to which
the earth is expected to become hotter are uncertain.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Germany had wanted
tougher commitments in the area of emissions, but added, ``We can
live with'' the communique.
   Environmental groups immediately lambasted the summit as having
failed to produce substantive progress on environmental concerns.
   President Bush fired back, saying he wasn't out to ``get some
brownie points'' from the environmental groups.
   He told a news conference that the summit had produced ``a
reasoned position, not a radical position that's going to throw a
lot of American men and women out of jobs.''
   The summit declaration emphasized forestry planks. It called for
immediate negotiations to forge a worldwide forestation program; a
World Bank plan to stop destruction of Brazil's tropical rain
forests, and a toughening of the World Bank's current Tropical
Forestry Action Plan to emphasize ``conservation and biological
diversity.''
   ``The destruction of forests has reached alarming proportions,''
the summit communique said.
   A forestry program could end up helping combat global warming
eventually because trees absorb the carbon dioxide emissions that
are contributing to the earth's warming. Scientists say 20 percent
of global warming is due to deforestation.
   Kohl said he was pleased about the summit leaders' commitment on
Brazilian rain forests. ``The continuing destruction of tropical
forests must be stopped through an immediate program,'' he said.
   The leaders said the forestry agreement should be ready for
signing by 1992.
   The general language of the summit communique stated: ``We as
industrialized countries have an obligation to be leaders in
meeting these challenges'' on climate change, ozone depletion,
deforestation, marine pollution, and the loss of biological
diversity.
   But environmentalists said the seven leaders had abandoned their
promise at their Paris summit a year ago to take decisive, urgent
action on environmental problems.
   ``Despite their green rhetoric, the G-7 leaders leave Houston in
the red on the environment,'' the Envirosummit coalition of
prominent environmental groups said. The group welcomed the promise
of a forestry protection plan, however.
   ``The summit is a failure on the environment because they did
nothing on global warming,'' said Dan Becker of the Sierra Club.
``In order to cover over their inaction on global warming, they've
added a fig leaf on rain forests.''
   On the contentious issue of global warming, the communique
included vague compromise language calling for ``appropriate
implementing protocols'' to stem global warming ``as expeditiously
as possible'' but it was unclear whether such protocols would have
to wait until after a 1992 convention on global warming.
   The Bush administration says more research is needed on climate
change before dramatic steps are taken to curb carbon dioxide
emissions.

<HEAD>Captain Tells Coast Guard His Crew Staged Mutiny, But No Charges
Pressed</HEAD>

   A New Bedford fishing boat captain who reported
that his crew was staging a mutiny decided Wednesday not to press
charges. Authorities suspect the problem was a homesick teen-ager.
   Capt. Gary Feener, the 30-year-old skipper of the Barnacle Bill
first called the Coast Guard Tuesday night. He said he was locked
in the pilot house with his first mate, fearing for his life,
according to Coast Guard Seaman Steve Aitkins. His seven crew
members were in a state of mutiny, he said.
   A half-hour later, the captain called saying calm had been
restored. Fifty minutes later, Feener was telling the Coast Guard
that his men were tearing up the 73-foot vessel, armed with knives
and hammers.
   A Coast Guard cutter steamed out to meet the scalloper and
reached it at dawn Wednesday about 90 miles east of Nantucket.
   About five armed Coast Guard officers boarded the boat and the
cutter escorted it back to shore in Nantucket. Once they arrived
Wednesday morning, Feener decided he wouldn't press charges and the
crew was allowed to leave.
   Nantucket Police Sgt. Charles Gibson gave eight men and the
14-year-old son of one of them a lift to a ferry that would take
them to Hyannis to go where they pleased.
   The crew members were calm and orderly although the captain
appeared to be upset, Gibson said.
   They said ``something about the crew wanting to come back to
port and the skipper not wanting to come back,'' according to
Gibson. Apparently the 14-year-old was on board and wanted to
return home after three days at sea, but the skipper refused and
that's when the troubled started, Gibson said.

   Q: In your discussions, why did Germany and other countries
think it's necessary now?
   A: Well, Germany has some very special interests that we
understand. And we're not _ as I said over in London, Helen, we're
not urging everybody to march in lockstep. Just as on our programs
for Central America, I want to see more help from the G-7 and the
G-24, and anybody else who will listen, to help the democracies in
Central and South America. And they've got certain priorities, and
I hope they will be able to help in this way. But if we go forward
as we have in assisting Nicaragua and Panama, I don't feel that
everybody has to move in lockstep on that support for democracy.
   Brit?
   Q: Mr. President, the final communique here reflecting your
views in no small part on agricultural subsidies calls upon each
nation to, quote, ``make substantial progressive reductions in
support and protection of agriculture.'' Does this mean, sir, that
you're prepared to ask Congress to abolish some of the more
notorious forms of support subsidy that are part of our farm
program?
   A: Absolutely. And we have to do it, and it's a two-way street,
and I expect there would be some political opposition, because like
many of these countries, we protect. But I am convinced, and I
believe Congress would support the concept, that if we all do this
and we all reduce barriers and we all make a freer trading system,
that the United States can compete. But I'm sure I would have some
obstacles for certain _ from the supporters of certain programs
that have been in existence for a long time. But that's a little
down the road now, and I think as far as the EC goes it's a little
down the road, so what we're trying to do is move the whole thing
forward without saying that we have to have, tomorrow, totally
unprotected trade. I'd like to shoot for that some day. I've said
that before.
   Q: Well, how soon, sir, will you be going to Congress with a
legislative package to begin to undo _
   A: Well, as soon as we see what progress is made in the GATT.
That's where the next action is, is in these talks that are coming
up, I think it's just on the 23rd of this month or some time. And
that's _ that's why I think this language that we worked out and
that all of you have I think now, is encouraging, because we all
know that agriculture has been a major stumbling block. And my
special Trade Representative, Carla Hills, impressed on me the need
to move that particular category forward. And that's why _ and we
did get agreement. So, let's _ but the next step, before we talk
about needing a legislative package, is to get agreement out of the
GATT. Kathy?
   Q: Mr. President, if the study delays a decision on aid to the
Soviet Union beyond German reunification, would it not be expected
that there would be a lessening of interest in the (summit ?)
countries in helping the Soviet Union, if the German unification
question is resolved by that time?
   A: No, I think events are changing so fast that different
countries are going to look at this with slightly different senses
of priority, but in the meantime this study will go forward.
   We have sent, in a bilateral sense, many missions to the Soviet
Union. Alan Greenspan was over there on his own. We've had Dick
Thornburgh over there talking about reordering the _ helping
reorder the justice system. We have people from the stock markets
over there. We've had a wide array of individuals and groups of
business people go. And so the _ that process of trying to assist
in change and in reform is underway bilaterally.
   But this look that the IMF will coordinate and be done by these
other agencies will kind of give an official _ at least for the G-7
_ we will look at it in rather an official way and then see if we
can decide on more collective action at the next summit or whether
we proceed individually on a case-by-case basis. John and then Ann.

<HEAD>Tass Says Gorbachev Protege Has Won Party's No. 2 Job</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Ukrainian protege of Mikhail S. Gorbachev was
elected Wednesday to be his right-hand man in the Communist Party,
the Tass news agency reported, in a stinging rebuff to the party's
leading traditionalist.
   Vladimir Ivashko, the man Gorbachev picked to run the Ukraine
last fall, was elected to the post of deputy general secretary of
the Communist Party by delegates to the 28th party congress, Tass
reported, citing unidentified ``trustworthy sources.''
   He defeated Politburo conservative Yegor K. Ligachev, who has
been Gorbachev's most vocal hard-line critic. Tass did not give any
vote totals in its brief report.
   Ivashko will run the party's day-to-day affairs. Gorbachev, who

   Ligachev's loss was a stunning defeat for the conservatives, who

<HEAD>HOUSTON: Then Ann.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, on the question of the environment, you, in
the past, and your chief of staff, to say the least, too, have
always said that there has not been enough information, you needed
to study more. Now you're prepared to move, particularly on the
global warming question. Who twisted your arm? What changed your
mind here?
   A: Well, I think we're moving forward because we recognize there
is a problem. I thought we called for more data in here, but we
need _ clearly we need more. When you take the NASA study, and then
some people point to that as challenging the concepts of global
climate change, why, I think everybody _ well, put it this way:
Everybody at this summit agreed that we need _ needed more
scientific information, but the steps that we've recommended here
in this communique we can enthusiastically endorse.
   And so I think we came out with a reasoned position, not a
radical position that's going to throw a lot of American men and
women out of jobs. And yet we've done an awful lot, and I think
others at the summit recognized it, in terms of cleaning up the
air. We've got a proposal, and I told them proudly of it, to redo
our Clean Air Act, and they were very much impressed with that. You
might have heard
   Prime Minister Mulroney's supportive comments about that. So
there's a lot of things working bilaterally, and _ in terms of
emissions, and I think we have a very reasonable position at this
point.
   Q: If I can follow _
   A: Yes.
   Q: _ there seems to be a little wiggle room on CO2. Are
   you making a clear commitment to do something about it?
   A: No. I wouldn't read anything into the _ into these texts
beyond what is actually printed there. Yes, Ann?
   Q: I understand it would take some time for the Soviet economy
to reform, but are you suggesting, when you link Soviet aid to arms
control, that you could never imagine any direct aid so long as
there are any Soviet weapons aimed at the West?
   A: No, I didn't say that. But I'm _ I would really prefer to
stand on what I have simply said; there may _ the world is changing
very fast. But they know that we've got some big difficulties on
the regional questions and on the fact that a lot of missiles are
aimed at the United States. But a good way to start in doing
something about that is to have a successful conclusion on the
START treaty. So, I don't want to go beyond where we are right now.
   If you'd asked me last year at this time if I could have
predicted the rapidity of change, I would have _ or the changes
that took place _ have taken place, I couldn't have predicted them.
So, I don't know exactly where we will be. But I do know that this
proposal we've made is sound.
   Q: Do you think if the IMF does say that some direct aid is
necessary, that perhaps that would spur greater arms control
movement?
   A: If they say _ excuse me, the IMF says what?
   Q: If the IMF study suggests that direct aid is appropriate, do
you think that in turn could stimulate or speed up arms control on
behalf of the Soviets?
   A: I would think _ I would hope so. I would take _ I think
Gorbachev is committed to a fast track on strategic arms. Yeah,
John, and then we'll take these.
   Q: On aid to the Soviets. You keep saying that the American
people simply aren't ready to give cash to Gorbachev. Now, if the
IMF comes back with a report, Gorbachev accepts some of those
recommendations, they cut way back on aid to Cuba, largely which
consists of oil shipments after all, not money, he does these
things you want, are you ready before the 1992 presidential
campaign to go out there and tell the American people that you
would send American cash or credits _ provide credits to Gorbachev?
   A: Your question is too hypothetical. I can't go into a
hypothesis like that. And we'll wait and see. We've taken a path
that's based on the facts right now. And I would just say that I
think Mr. Gorbachev understands that at this juncture sending money
from the United States is not in the cards. And he knows what needs
to be done to change the formula. And I like to think he's going to
try and maybe he'll come out of this Congress where many predicted
his demise and feel encouraged to go forward. But I'm not going to
answer a hypothetical question of that nature.

<HEAD>Study Finds More Time Needed for Station Maintenance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An internal NASA study concludes that
astronauts will have to spend 75 percent more time spacewalking to
maintain the space station than previously thought, a congressman
said Wednesday.
   ``It's going in the wrong direction, not the right direction,''
Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., said in a telephone interview.
   Green, the ranking minority member of the appropriations
subcommittee that oversees NASA spending, said his staff had seen
some of the same gloomy forecasts as The New York Times, which
published the results in its Wednesday editions.
   NASA has said it will make the document public next week, along
with plans to reduce the number of space walks through design
changes and other means. The agency declined requests to make the
study public immediately.
   The space station's top official, William B. Lenoir, has
maintained that the estimates would be high but that the number
could be cut sharply.
   Green said the maintenance requirements were only one issue. The
other, he said, is the limited amount of electrical power that
appears to be available for microgravity experiments on the station.
   NASA plans initially to have 75 kilowatts of power, of which 45
kilowatts will be needed for housekeeping.
   Green said that if NASA can't bring maintenance under control or
provide enough power to be useful, it might be time to change
designs.
   ``One has to look at the possibility that if the situation
continues to deteriorate in terms of safety and the capacity of the
station, there comes a point where we say, `Hey, this design is not
working' and maybe go back to the design this country had,
Skylab,'' Green said.
   The Skylab program in 1973 and 1974 involved sets of three
astronauts working inside the orbiting laboratory for periods of
28, 56 and 84 days.
   The space station, whose cost has more than tripled from the $8
billion estimate when President Reagan proposed it in 1984, is in
the preliminary design phase. A review late this year will lead to
the start of detailed designs.
   A preliminary report in March by a 12-member team headed by Dr.
William J. Fisher, an astronaut, and Charles R. Price, a robotics
engineer, found the station would need more than 2,200 hours of
maintenance each year, far more than the 130 hours that had been
budgeted.
   The New York Times said the final report expects that more than
3,800 hours of spacewalking time would be needed. To date,
astronauts have logged 400 hours of space walks, each a risky
exercise.
   ``You can't do it as currently designed,'' the newspaper quoted
an unnamed engineer. ``You have to build a different station.''
   Green said the space station would be useful for two major
tasks: learning what happens when humans spend extended time in
space and processing materials in a near-zero gravity environment.
   Congress is considering a request of $2.5 billion for the
station in the next fiscal year. The first elements of the station
are expected to be put into orbit early in 1995, with completion
some 28 flights later in 1999.

   Significant progress has been made during the past year under
the strengthened debt strategy, which has renewed the resolve in a
number of debtor countries to continue economic reforms essential
to future growth. In particular, the recent commercial bank
agreements with Chile, Costa Rica, Mexico, Morocco, the Philippines
and Venezuela involve significant debt and debt-service reduction.
Important financial support for debt and debt-service reduction is
being provided by the IMF and the World Bank, as well as by Japan.
The Paris club has agreed, in order to support medium term
IMF-supported reform and financing programs, to provide adequate
restructuring agreements, notably through multi-year reschedulings
and through lengthening of the repayment period.

<HEAD>The Environment</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   One of our most important responsibilities is to pass on to
future generations an environment whose health, beauty, and
economic potential are not threatened. Environmental challenges
such as climate change, ozone depletion, deforestation, marine
pollution, and loss of biological diversity require closer and more
effective international cooperation and concrete action. We as
industrialized countries have an obligation to be leaders in
meeting these challenges. We agree that, in the face of threats of
irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific
certainty is no excuse to postpone actions which are justified in
their own right. We recognize that strong, growing, market-oriented
economies provide the best means for successful environmental
protection
   Climate change is of key importance. We are committed to
undertake common efforts to limit emissions of greenhouse gases,
such as carbon dioxide. We strongly support the work of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and look forward
to the release of its full report in August. The Second World
Climate Conference provides the opportunity for all countries to
consider the adoption of strategies and measures for limiting or
stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions, and to discuss an effective
international response. We reiterate our support for the
negotiation of a framework convention on climate change, under the
auspices of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the
World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The convention should be
completed by 1992. Work on appropriate implementing protocols
should be undertaken as expeditiously as possible and should
consider all sources and sinks.
   We welcome the amendment of the Montreal Protocol to phase out
the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000 and to
extend coverage of the Protocol to other ozone depleting
substances. The establishment of a financial mechanism to assist
developing countries to tackle ozone depletion marks a new and
positive step in cooperation between the developed and developing
worlds. We applaud the announcement in London by some major
developing countries, including India and China, that they intend
to review their position on adherence to the Montreal Protocol and
its amendments. We would welcome their adherence as a crucial
reinforcement of the effectiveness of the Protocol, which would
ultimately lead to a worldwide phase out of ozone depleting
substances. We urge all parties to ratify the amended Protocol as
quickly as possible. to combat desertification; expand projects to
conserve biological diversity; protect the Antarctic; and assist
developing countries in their environmental efforts. We will work
within UNEP and other fora to achieve these objectives, and will
participate actively in UNEP's work to protect bio diversity...
   To cope with energy-related environmental damage, priority must
be given to improvements in energy efficiency and to the
development of alternative energy sources. For the countries that
make such a choice, nuclear energy will continue to be an important
contributor to our energy supply and can play a significant role in
reducing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. Countries should
continue efforts to ensure highest worldwide performance standards
for nuclear and other energy in order to protect health and the
environment, and ensure the highest safety.

<TEXT>
   Covenant House said Wednesday it has selected a
nun as its new president, nearly five months after its founder
resigned the position amid charges of sexual and financial
impropriety.
   The troubled shelter system for young runaways will be led by
Sister Mary Rose McGeady, 62, a social services worker and
associate executive director of Catholic Charities in the Roman
Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn.
   Church-affiliated Covenant House had been seeking a Catholic
clergy member as its president, preferably one with a social
service background. Its founder, the Rev. Bruce Ritter, is a
Franciscan priest.
   After reviewing 120 possible candidates, ``I could not be more
confident that we have made a superb choice in Sister Mary Rose,''
said Ralph Pfeiffer Jr., chairman of the Covenant House Board of
Directors.
   The board named Sister McGeady to the top administrative job at
a special meeting Tuesday night.
   In a statement, she said: ``I look forward to the challenge of
insuring that Covenant House continues to shine as a beacon for the
thousands of kids who are still out there without a family or
home.''
   Covenant House runs the nation's largest shelter program for
young runaways. It houses 25,000 youths annually in 17 dormitories
across in the United States, in Canada and Latin America.
   It has been beleaguered in the first half of this year by
allegations against Ritter and by persistent charges of
mismanagement. Anticipating a continuing drop in the donations that
sustain it, the board has laid off 111 of its 420 employees and has
cut its budget from $86 million to $72 million.
   Ritter, who resigned Feb. 27, had been accused of having sexual
relations with shelter residents and lending Covenant House funds
to two former board members. He has denied wrongdoing.
   In a telephone interview, Sister McGeady said: ``We're hoping
the donations will come back up.''
   While no further budget cuts are planned now, she added, ``If
they don't it might be necessary for us to do some more cutting.''
   A member of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul,
Sister McGeady has served as executive director of the Astor Home
for Children in Rhinebeck; the Nazareth Child Care Center in
Boston; and the Learning Center for Exceptional Children at the
Brooklyn diocese.
   At Catholic Charities she directs 80 diocesean social service
programs in Queens, which is part of the Brooklyn diocese. She
oversees a staff of more than 800 people and a budget of $40
million.
   She takes office at Covenant House on Sept. 1.

   Q: Let me ask you this. You got sort of a delay on aid to the

NATO summit, as a victory for George Bush across the board, whether
it's cutting agricultural subsidies or Europeans, or whether it's
the environment. What didn't you get at this summit that you

<HEAD>Library Board Rescinds Restrictive Children's Card</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK LAWN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bowing to public pressure, library
trustees have reversed their decision to introduce a ``PG-13'' card
that would have confined young people to the children's area of the
library.
   More than 100 people packed the trustees' meeting Tuesday to
protest the card. It would have given parents the option of
restricting their children younger than 14 to the children's room
of Oak Lawn Memorial Library in suburban Chicago.
   ``I was so proud of the people of Oak Lawn last night,'' Beth
Baird of the Friends of the Oak Lawn Library said Wednesday. ``They
just came on their own _ just people who felt deeply about freedom
and the freedom to read.''
   Even those in favor of keeping the card _ dubbed ``PG-13'' after
the movie rating system that advises parental guidance for kids 13
and younger _ were pleased with the turnout.
   ``I think it was wonderful. Government in action _ you couldn't
ask for anything better,'' said trustee Carol James, who favored
keeping the limited-access card.
   At June's board meeting, with three members absent, the trustees
voted 3-1 to introduce the optional card. Adult books and the
reference room, which houses encyclopedias and other reference
books, would have been off-limits for children with the card.
   Tuesday, the board voted 4-3 to rescind the policy.
   James said the card had been largely misunderstood. She said it
was intended ``to give parents the right to choose a library card
for their children.''
   ``They were all there, pumped up ... against censorship,'' James
said. ``I'm against censorship _ that was not the motion that we
rescinded.''
   The American Library Association decried the card's introduction
as a bad precedent.
   ``Kids who read succeed,'' association President Richard
Dougherty said after the board suggested the card. ``Anything that
puts barriers in front of that is not good.''
   Residents said they were chagrined by the media attention the
card attracted.
   ``I'm deeply ashamed of our library and totally embarrassed,''
said resident Mary Grana before the vote. ``My friends from all
over are saying `Oh, you live in that Nazi village?'''
   ``As a parent, I've always had the choice,'' said Kathleen
Miller, a resident for 25 years. ``Who are you to give me the right
I already have?''

   Q: Isn't it drawing it a little fine, though, to say arms
control, yes, but Soviet _ aid to the Soviets, which really there
were no conditions placed on, that could be used for anything _
German aid that could be used for anything? Isn't that _
   A: Well, I don't _ you may be a little ahead of me on what the
Soviets plan to use the German aid for, aid that has not yet been
forthcoming. I understand that Chancellor Kohl is going to Moscow,
I think. Where's _ (to staff:) Is that correct, within the next
couple of weeks _ (returning), but we don't know that, as to what
conditions will be on the funding and how it will be _ how it'd be
used in the Soviet Union.
   But I gave him our position, he gave me his. But that's not
enough to break up a strong alliance and a very comfortable and
strong relationship, bilateral relationship, between the Federal
Republic and the United States. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, on the forestry issue, there are a number of
sentences in the declaration talking about the importance of
preserving forests globally. What impact would that have on the
American domestic field? Would it, for example, change the balance
that your administration has been trying to strike on the issue of
the Pacific Northwest forests and the spotted owls there?
   A: No. We are committed to prudent forest management, but we are
also committed to planting a billion trees a year, and putting real
emphasis on reforestation. So I don't think there's any
contradiction. Some would argue _ some of the purists in the
environmental movement _ that you've got to stop right where we
are, not harvest any lumber at all. And some of it would be done in
protection of the owl, and some because they're opposed to
harvesting the old growth forests. I don't share that view, and I
do think we can find a balance where the net is an increase in the
numbers of trees. Yes?
   Q: If I could follow up _
   Q: Back on agriculture _
   Q: _ what response do you have to the people in Third World
countries who argue that you're asking them to make sacrifices on
their economic development, that you're not willing to ask American
workers to make parallel sacrifices?
   A: I think we have to find ways to assist those who would take
that view, and I think many of our countries who moved forward and
did not have great respect for the environment now _ and now are
doing a good job on it, and I would put the United States in that
category, with pride, I might say _ should find ways to assist
these countries. Yes?
   Q: Back on agriculture, Mr. President. You said that you were
encouraged about the language on agricultural subsidies. Could you
say why, specifically when the U.S. gave in on the key question of
allowing one common measure to be used for all subsidies? And also
on a separate matter, could you tell us whether you got any
commitment for help from your allies on the Latin American aid
initiative?
   A: Not being a technical expert on these highly technical GATT
negotiations, I relied heavily on advice from experts like Carla
Hills, who is one such an expert, and Clayton Yeutter, Bob
Mosbacher involved also. And these people who've been wrestling
with the technicalities of the trade question were very pleased at
the formulation we came up with. They felt without such
formulation, the whole successful conclusion of the GATT round was
at stake. But they think that the wording we have that refers
peripherally to this De Zeeuw report, and _ is enough now to move
the agricultural discussions forward when they _ when they meet
soon again.
   So _ and what was the second part? I don't know on the others. I
know that some of them have expressed an interest in helping, but I
didn't ask for a collective decision out of the G-7 on that
question. Yes?

<HEAD>Strike Paralyzes Capital; Radio Report: Duvalier Plans Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A protest strike over the return
from exile of two former officials linked to human rights abuses
under dictatorial regimes on Wednesday paralyzed this normally
bustling capital of 1 million people.
   Meanwhile, the independent Radio Haiti-Inter reported deposed
dictator Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier had booked a flight to
Haiti for July 29 and that two of his former ministers were
expected to arrive Wednesday night.
   Duvalier has lived in exile in France since he was ousted in a
popular uprising in February 1986.
   The radio station gave no attribution for the report, which
could not be independently confirmed.
   The one-day protest strike was supported by political groups,
labor unions and many civic groups. Strike supporters expressed
concern that Duvalier supporters were attempting to make a comeback
in Haiti.
   Downtown shops, open-air markets and gas stations were closed
for the one-day protest, and no buses were running. Streets were
virtually deserted.
   Employers sent home the few assembly line workers who showed up
for work at the sprawling industrial park near the airport,
independent Radio Antilles reported. About 15,000 people are
employed there.
   Reports from Cap-Haitien and Gonaives, Haiti's second- and
third-largest cities, indicated widespread support for the strike
in the provinces. Most businesses were closed but buses were still
running.
   There were no reports of violence.
   Unity Assembly, a coalition of 12 political groups, called the
strike Tuesday after the government failed to comply with its
demand to arrest two former high-ranking officials, Roger Lafontant
and Williams Regala, who returned separately from exile last week.
   As interior and defense minister under ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier,
Lafontant reputedly headed the dreaded Tonton Macoutes paramilitary
force. Duvalier's ouster ended the 29-year dynasty founded by his
father, Francois ``Papa Doc,'' who died in 1971.
   Regala, a retired army major general, served as interior and
defense minister under two previous military regimes. He is widely
regarded as the mastermind of the election day massacre of Nov. 29,
1987, in which thugs supported by the army shot and hacked to death
at least 34 voters at polling stations.
   Lafontant had been living in self-imposed exile in the
neighboring Dominican Republic the past 4{ years.
   Regala fled to the United States in March when military ruler
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril was forced into exile by a popular uprising.
   Their return to Haiti heightened fears of an organized attempt
to disrupt general elections scheduled for Nov. 4.
   Unity Assembly declared in a statement that Lafontant and Regala
``at large are ill omens of growing insecurity and a slap in the
face of justice.''
   In San Juan, Puerto Rico, Paul Laortue, a Senate candidate in
the aborted 1987 elections, said the return of Lafontant and Regala
was a ``very serious test by the Duvalierist sector to find out if
they can make a comeback.''
   ``If these two guys can stay in Haiti, that means that before
the end of the year Jean-Claude Duvalier could attempt to come
back. ... I don't know if he would dare, but it would be viable,''
said Latortue, who now teaches at the University of Puerto Rico.
   The Unity Assembly coalition had given civilian President Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot until noon Tuesday to arrest Lafontant and Regala.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, who was appointed president to succeed
Avril, made no public statement in response to the protest.
   Her silence underscored a long-standing rift between the
president and the 19-member Council of State, which was appointed
to govern alongside her in a caretaker civilian government.
   In a statement Monday, the Council of State said Lafontant and
Regala had been widely accused of ``repeated human-rights
violations and illicit enrichment.''
   The council said their return from exile was ``due to the policy
of the present executive (Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot), which hasn't
managed to set the legal process in motion.''
   An arrest warrant for Lafontant, issued Saturday by government
prosecutor Bayard Vincent, was not served. But the police chief,
Col. Jean-Claude Duperval, said it would be, independent Tele-Haiti
reported Tuesday. A second warrant was issued Tuesday morning.

<HEAD>Seven More Cubans Seek Refuge in Czech Embassy in Havana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven more Cubans took refuge
Wednesday at Prague's embassy in Havana, the Czechoslovak news
agency CTK reported, bringing the number of Cuban asylum-seekers to
14.
   Czechoslovakia accused Cuba of failing to keep additional Cubans
out, as promised. Cuba assailed the embassy staff and said the
refugees must quit the embassy at once.
   Five Cuban opposition activists sought refuge in the embassy on
Monday, walking through the main door apparently without incident,
Czechoslovak officials said earlier in Prague.
   On Tuesday, two Cubans scaled the mission's fence and asked
asylum. CTK identified them as Igor Campana and Alejandro R. Lugo.
They said they were students.
   Cuban police then cordoned off the street leading to the
embassy, but the seven new arrivals apparently climbed over the
fence during a power outage in the neighborhood during the night,
CTK said. It said they forced their way into the embassy building
Wednesday morning, damaging the glass doors.
   CTK said the seven ``penetrated'' the Czechoslovak mission ``in
spite of the fact that Cuban authorities promised maximum help in
guarding the building, to avoid further complication of the
situation.''
   Later, CTK said Cuban police were not at their posts during the
blackout.
   ``The seven Cubans are mostly jobless persons, who were not
active in the opposition. This fact gave rise to conjectures that a
provocation might be involved,'' CTK said, without elaborating.
   Czechoslovakia's charge d'affaires in Havana, Jan Doemoek, went
to the Cuban Foreign Ministry on Wednesday to convey Prague's
``protest that Cuban authorities did not keep their promise not to
allow any other Cubans'' to enter the mission, the state agency
said. Doemoek received no explanation, it said.
   The news agency said Cuban officials accused the embassy staff
of having ``violated ... all valid international regulations and
agreements.''
   It quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying the Cubans must leave
the Czechoslovak Embassy ``immediately, without any preliminary
conditions.''
   Czechoslovak authorities had said Tuesday they were not
considering turning the Cubans over to the authorities.
   The two countries were close allies before the democratic
revolution in Czechoslovakia last year swept Communists from power.

   A former roommate of the jogger gang-raped and
beaten almost to death in Central Park testified Wednesday that he
didn't recognize her when he first saw her after the attack, lying
comatose in a hospital bed.
   ``I looked at her for 10 minutes,'' said Patrick Garrett, 29.
``It was actually difficult to identify her, as well as I know
her.''
   ``Police showed me her ring,'' Garrett said. ``I knew it was her
ring.''
   During his testimony, prosecutors entered into evidence color
photographs taken four days after the April 29, 1989, attack,
showing cuts, bruises, scrapes, and red welts and scratches on
almost every part of the woman's body.
   Garrett, the prosecution's 28th witness in the trial of three
youths, said he met the victim when both joined the Salomon
Brothers investment banking firm in 1986.
   For a time they shared a two-bedroom apartment, as platonic
friends, he said. They took separate apartments in January 1989.
   Garrett said he got worried and went to Metropolitan Hospital on
April 30 after the woman failed to keep an appointment the night
before and didn't return a telephone message, then failed to show
up for work or call in.
   When he called, prosecutors say, the woman was lying in a ravine
in the park, where she had been gang-raped and beaten by a pack of
youths.
   Defense lawyers objected to Garrett's testimony and to the
showing of the photographs, saying neither added anything new and
that the latter could prejudice jurors.
   On trial in Manhattan state Supreme Court are Raymond Santana
and Yusef Salaam, both 16, and Antron McCray, 15. They are charged
with attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, assault, robbery and
riot in the attack on the woman and attacks on two male joggers.
   The woman, now 29, has returned to work, but suffered brain
damage and does not remember the attack, says Assistant District
Attorney Elizabeth Lederer, who won't say whether the woman will
testify.
   McCray, Santana and Salaam are on trial in an adult court, but
if convicted they will be sentenced as juvenile offenders, to up to
10 years in prison.
   Three other youths are to stand trial on the same charges later
this year.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Urges Heart-Valve Maker Warn Patients of Defects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Deborah Mesce</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group petitioned federal
authorities Wednesday to force a heart-valve manufacturer to warn
56,000 people living with the implanted device about the valve's
defects.
   Public Citizen wants the Irvine, Calif.-based Shiley Inc., a
subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., to notify all those who have had the
device implanted about the symptoms and consequences of a failed
valve. The group also wants the company to advise patients of the
risks and benefits of having the valve removed.
   The company has reported to the FDA more than 250 deaths that
have resulted from fractures of the valve.
   Public Citizen asked the FDA to order the company to send a
notice to each person who has had a Shiley valve implanted
describing the signs and symptoms of imminent valve failure.
   The notice also would list each hospital in the United States
where open heart surgery is performed so patients would know where
to go for emergency valve replacement surgery.
   Public Citizen filed suit against the company in March to force
the company to notify patients directly, but the suit was dismissed
in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Public Citizen has filed an
appeal.
   Robert J. Fauteux, a spokesman for Shiley, said the company has
followed the FDA's policy on the matter, which recommends that
companies communicate with patients through their physicians.
   Shiley has kept physicians of patients with Shiley valves
updated on the device's problems on a regular basis since 1980, he
said.
   The FDA is reviewing its recommendation on how to get
information to patients, and ``if the FDA were to reconsider its
policy, Shiley would reassess our policy,'' Fauteux said.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said agency officials would review
Public Citizen's petition.

   The Senate approved a broad crime bill
Wednesday that stiffens prison terms for savings and loan fraud,
bans nine semiautomatic weapons and makes three dozen federal
offenses punishable by death.
   The election-year measure sailed through the Senate, 94-6, with
opposition coming largely from critics of capital punishment.
   ``This is the toughest and most comprehensive crime bill in our
history,'' said Judiciary Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del. He
said the measure could cost up to $2 billion in 1991 and added the
source of the funds was uncertain.
   At the last minute, the Senate added $162.5 million to combat
savings and loan fraud and tough prison terms for those convicted
in the scandal, including life for ``kingpins.'' Whistle blowers
could collect rewards of up to $300,000 for turning in S&amp;L looters.
   The bill would add hundreds of savings and loan fraud
investigators and allow the government to seize the assets of S&amp;L
looters in the same fashion that it now confiscates those of drug
kingpins.
   Lawmakers said they have felt distinct pressure from back home
to step up prosecution of S&amp;L offenders.
   ``We need to be cracking down on the orgy of fraud and
lawbreaking that occurred in the savings and loan crisis,'' said
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
   Among the provisions settled earlier was the ban on import or
domestic manufacture of nine kinds of semiautomatic assault
weapons, approved over the fierce opposition of the National Rifle
Association.
   Senators also had agreed on provisions allowing executions for
34 federal offenses including treason, hostage-taking and
presidential assassination. It is already possible under current
law to seek capital punishment for drug kingpins who commit murder
and terrorists who kill Americans overseas.
   Other parts of the crime bill would streamline the appeals
system with an eye to ending delays of a decade or more in carrying
out executions, tighten money laundering laws and provide for 1,000
new FBI agents, 1,000 narcotics agents, 500 Border Patrol officers
and 480 federal prosecutors.
   Additional features range from an increase in funding for ``boot
camp'' prisons to tougher penalties for sale of the new drug
``ice.''
   The House currently is fashioning its own version of a
comprehensive crime bill.
   The Bush administration has been cool to the Senate package,
largely because of its gun features. The administration has banned
import of a number of ``non-sporting'' semiautomatic weapons and
has urged a limit on the size of ammunition clips, but opposes a
ban on semiautomatics manufactured here.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh issued a statement Wednesday
afternoon, however, saying he wanted to ``commend the Senate
action'' in adopting an amended version of the crime bill with
``most of President Bush's proposals to combat crime and institute
much needed criminal justice reforms.''
   ``While there are some provisions of the Senate-passed bill that
the administration opposes, I am convinced that with continued
bipartisan cooperation the 101st Congress will help achieve the
president's goal,'' Thornburgh said.
   The Senate bill started life as President Bush's crime package
but over the last year was virtually rewritten on Capitol Hill. The
process has been punctuated by potshots back and forth between Bush
and Senate Democrats.
   As the Senate wrapped up its work, Biden grumbled that he was
tired of ``four months of political rhetoric'' from the
administration on the crime issue. ``Willie Horton is back in jail,
figuratively speaking,'' he said. ``The 1988 campaign is over.''
   Horton is a convict who went on a crime rampage after failing to
return from a weekend furlough. Bush supporters during the 1988
presidential campaign made him into a symbol of the need for a
crackdown on crime.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said Bush had been a powerful
stimulus to Senate action on the issue.
   ``Willie Horton is still a figure to be reckoned with in America
and on the Senate floor,'' Specter said.
   The crime bill being fashioned by the House Judiciary Committee
contains only minor firearms provisions. But a gun bill that
already has been approved by the panel would outlaw domestic
weapons that fail to meet the administration's ``sporting
purposes'' test.
   Gun-owner organizations say that bill could be tougher than the
one approved by the Senate. They say the plan could possibly be
added to the House crime bill when it reaches the floor.
   Despite its vaunted political power, the NRA was beaten
repeatedly in the Senate in recent months as it tried to rid the
crime bill of its firearms provisions. The heart of the lobbying
effort was a series of strongly worded mass mailings to home-state
gun owners.
   Sponsors of the ban credited their success to lobbying by police
organizations, although the Washington-based group Handgun Control
Inc. also waged a vigorous campaign.
   The effort began in January 1989 after a schoolyard massacre in
Stockton, Calif., carried out by a deranged man with the
semiautomatic version of the AK-47 assault rifle.
   Under the Senate bill, the following guns would be banned for
import or domestic manufacture:
   Norinco, Mitchell and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs
(including the AK-47); Action Arms Israeli Military Industries Uzi
and Galil; Beretta AR-70 (SC-70); Colt AR-15 and CAR-15; Fabrique
Nationale FN-FAL, FN-LAR and FNC; MAC-10 and MAC-11; Steyr AUG;
INTRATEC TEC-9 and the Street Sweeper and the Striker.
   Senators voting against the crime bill were William Armstrong,
R-Colo.; David Durenberger, R-Minn.; Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and William
Roth, R-Del.

<HEAD>Senator Concerned About Pentagon Plans for Unproven Radar Jammer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a Senate panel expressed
concern Wednesday that the Pentagon might move ahead on a $7
billion program to build radar jammers for military aircraft
without independently testing the system.
   In a letter to a top Pentagon official, Sen. David Pryor,
D-Ark., also questioned whether proceeding with the Airborne
Self-Protection Jammer early next year violates the fiscal 1990
defense spending bill, which prevented the release of funds until
operational tests are completed.
   ``This acquisition plan could be construed as an end-run around
the appropriations language,'' Pryor wrote in a two-page letter to
John A. Betti, the Pentagon's acquisition chief.
   Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hansen said the department had not
seen the letter and would have no immediate comment. She added that
Pentagon officials discussed the program at length during testimony
before Congress in May.
   Pryor pointed out in the letter that under the current test
schedule, independent Navy developmental tests will not begin until
October and will not be completed until June 1991.
   Operational tests by the service will not begin until July 1991
and will not be completed until December 1991, the senator said.
   The only test results that will be available to the Pentagon
when officials make their decision on the program will be from the
contractor.
   ``These contractor tests are not considered independent; these
tests, with one exception, will not include any of the test areas
which the ASPJ (the jammer) flunked in 1988-89 Navy tests,'' said
Pryor, who chairs the Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee on
federal services, post office and civil services.
   The senator has been highly critical of the program, which was
the focus of a May 11 hearing before his panel.
   At the hearing, the Pentagon's deputy inspector general, Derek
Vander Schaaf, testified that the system's effectiveness was
unproven and recommended delaying production decisions until tests
are completed.
   The Pentagon envisions that the electronic system, to be
installed on more than 2,000 Navy and Air Force aircraft, would
increase the survivability of the planes by jamming or deceiving an
enemy's radar-controlled weapons.

<HEAD>HOUSTON: Question. Yes?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, the Soviets have already reacted negatively to
advance word of the part of the communique that said that they
should reform if they would _ that reform would help them get
further aid. What would you tell Mr. Gorbachev when you speak to
him why he should not view this as the allied countries saying,
``The Cold War is over, you lost; here's what you have to do, here
are our conditions for integrating you back into Western society''?
   A: I think you phrased it well because we've got to be careful
that we don't send a signal that we don't want to send. But I don't
worry about this one because I sat up there at Camp David with Mr.
Gorbachev in a very frank discussion and told him the problems that
I have with going forward with financial aid.
   I've been quite open about it in the press conference following
a highly successful NATO summit. And incidentally, I think the
reaction from the Soviet Union on the NATO summit has been
extraordinarily positive, and so _ and extraordinarily so. And some
of that, I think, has been masked by the understandable attention
given to the G-7 meeting here. But it's been an _ extraordinarily
positive. And so far _ I think _ I think put it this way. It just
totally diminishes the risk of the kind of misunderstanding that
your question implies.
   Now, you saw the lively debate in the People's Congress. It
looks like our own Congress up there, yelling at each other and
debating and calling people names and doing all these frantic
things. So I'm not saying that somebody's not going to jump up,
having finished trying to fillet Gorbachev, and jump on me for the
way the _ the way we've reacted in this summit.
   I am saying that I am not going to have misunderstanding creep
in because of failure to communicate. And indeed, I've already sent
off a communication to Mr. Gorbachev and I will be in touch with
him personally very soon to discuss this. But I don't think there's
too much of a danger of that. Yeah?
   Q: If I could follow up, in his letter to you in your role as
host of this summit, did he ask for direct cash aid?
   A: I need help on that, but I think not. My reaction is that he
did not ask for that. I know he didn't have a price tag on it. But
he listed several categories of places where we could give support,
including credits. But let me _ Bob, was that a proper answer? I
don't want to (Response inaudible.) Okay. So I was right. Yeah,
Owen?
   Q: Some of your colleagues accused you of a double standard, Mr.
President, in supporting language yesterday that opened the door to
lending to China, particularly if it moves toward economic reforms,
and yet taking a much less flexible position regarding the Soviet
Union. How do you respond to that?
   A: I respond by saying we already have sanctions on China;
because China has not moved forward far enough on human rights,
those sanctions remain. We have offered the hope that, if they take
further steps in the human rights field, more can be done.
   We've said that we, for our _ well, we _ all of us together
would consider World Bank loans, which are _ which right now are
discouraged by the G-7 _ consider World Bank loans that would
contribute to the reform of the Chinese economy, and then I think
we added a little thing about especially those that would help on
this world environmental problem.
   So my answer to those is that they're wrong and that the
pressure is still on. And let's hope it will not be
counterproductive. I _ and I _ again, my position is, and I think
every summit leader there agrees with me _ every one, I believe _
that we should not further isolate China. There have been some
things that we can take some encouragement from.
   But we sanction _ sanctions are on China. We took the lead on
this question a year ago at the G-7 summit, and some who criticize
me fail to realize that. But I want to see them move forward, and I
want to see restored good relations with China, but we're not there
yet.

<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter said
Wednesday that he was willing to mediate Ethiopia's 29-year-old
civil war, but he expressed concern that northern rebels now may
favor a military victory.
   Carter spoke to reporters before leaving Addis Ababa. He came to
the Ethiopian capital for the three-day annual summit of the
Organization of African Unity.
   Carter also said he believed more emergency food supplies could
be distributed in the drought-stricken north through a recent
agreement reached by rebels and the government. That accord gave
international aid agencies permission to move supplies from the
rebel-held port of Massawa.
   The United Nations estimates 4.5 million of Ethiopia's 50
million people face starvation in the north. Many of those
imperiled live behind rebel lines.
   Carter said peace talks between President Mengistu Haile
Mariam's leftist government and the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front could resume any time with himself and former President
Julius Nyerere of Tanzania acting as brokers.
   But he added, ``Maybe the Eritreans believe they can win a
military victory easier than they can negotiate.''
   The Eritrean rebels and the Tigre People's Liberation Front are
fighting separate insurrections and control most of northern
Ethiopia. The Eritreans in particular control Massawa, one of two
Red Sea ports used for Ethiopian trade.
   Peace talks orchestrated by Carter and Nyerere broke down last
month after the guerrillas refused to sit at a negotiating table.
   Carter told the 26th OAU summit on Tuesday that Africa and its
550 million people would remain backward and impoverished if civil
wars continue.
   The United Nations has sent a team to Massawa to gauge prospects
of using the harbor as a gateway for aid shipments.
   In 1986, 1 million people died from starvation or related
illnesses in the worst famine in Ethiopia's history.

<HEAD>Mulroney Says Partners Baffled By Canada's Constitutional Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said
Wednesday his economic summit partners were ``absolutely baffled''
by Canada's constitutional crisis.
   Canada's 1986 plan to grant Quebec recognition as a ``distinct
society'' in the Canadian federation fell apart last month when the
Newfoundland legislature refused to ratify it, raising the
possibility of a renewed drive for independence by Quebec.
   Mulroney told reporters at a news conference following the close
of the summit that the other countries ``were quite surprised ...
that such a reasonable approach would not be quickly and
overwhelmingly approved.''
   No other nation asked about the status of the Canadian
federation, he said, but it came up on a procedural point at lunch
Tuesday. In response he said he offered remarks that ``covered the
waterfront'' and elicited comments from the others.
   He said he told the luncheon that Canada without Quebec would be
the relative equivalent in population terms of the United States
without New York, Texas and California, ``and they didn't think
that made a lot of sense.''
   ``They are absolutely baffled that any nation in its right mind
would consider anything other than measures to strengthen its
unity,'' Mulroney said.

   Q: Can you just say, do you believe that financial aid could
play a role in stimulating reforms in the Soviet Union?
   A: Well, some think that. I don't particularly agree with that.
I think, when you see the Japanese move forward, as they plan to
do, to keep a commitment, they feel a solemn commitment to China
for this third yen loan, that they feel that way. I have great
respect for Prime Minister Kaifu, and I had a long talk with him
about that, and he _ as you know, they plan to move forward.
   And just as I can't get all exercised over what Chancellor Kohl
does, I feel the same way about what Prime Minister Kaifu is doing.
But he feels that the step he is about to take would encourage
reformers. I'm not sure that he's right in this regard, and I think
that the people in power there can build on the steps that they've
taken in a way to satisfy the rest of the people in the G-7 that we
should go back to more normal relations. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, a follow-up on Craig's question. In the past,
the United States did call the tune on allied relations with the
Soviet Union. Now that we're seeing key allies going their own way
on aid to the Soviet Union, aren't we seeing at least a subtle
change in the way the United States has to lead the Alliance?
   Aren't you having to give a little more leeway to the allies now
that the Cold War is over?
   A: We're dealing in entirely different times. Earlier on, in
terms of the Alliance, we had a much more formidable military
opposition. Now we see the Warsaw Pact in almost a state of
disarray. We see troops coming out. We see democracies replacing
totalitarian systems. So you have an entirely different era for the
United States. So I _ we have _ I think we have very good
understanding inside the G-7 about the Soviet Union.
   But if your question is, is it bad or does it alter the US role
if Chancellor Kohl, for very special reasons, goes forward, I would
argue that it does not. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, there's a lot of concern over President
Gorbachev's ability to hold onto power. Does his victory yesterday
suggest he will be around for a good while despite his serious
economic problems?
   A: Well, I don't know yet. But certainly he's surprised a lot of
us in this room, hasn't he? And including me. Who would have
thought he'd have a three to one victory, or whatever it was _ I
had the figures at the tip of my tongue a while back _ because it
was an impressive landslide inside a body, where, if I had gone by,
you know, just some impressions, wouldn't have thought he'd have
gotten quite that big a _ big a landslide. So, I don't know.
   And I think there's some discontent inside the Soviet Union. I
think he's got enormous problems. I hope that what we're doing to
help here will help with those problems. But certainly I'd have to
leave it there because I couldn't go beyond that. And I think if
you go to experts you'll find divisions on that question.
   Q: You don't think the election proves that he has a grip on
power then?
   A: Well, I think it does at this juncture, certainly in terms of
the Party, and certainly I think the way he's handling his foreign
affairs is probably getting great credit at home. I do understand
there's consumer concern, and that there's _ that everybody,
including Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze recognize that they
have enormous economic problems inside the Soviet Union. John?

<HEAD>HOUSTON: Union. John?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, on an issue outside the purview of this
summit, your son Neil _
   A: Yes?
   Q: Your son Neil has suggested that the savings and loan
regulators are conducting something of a vendetta against him
largely because his last name is the same as yours. Do you agree
with that charge?
   A: I agree that the president ought to stay out of it and that
the system ought to work. And I have great confidence in the
integrity and honor of my son. And beyond that, I'm _ say no more.
And if he's done something wrong, the system will _ will _ will
digest that. I have _ this is not easy for me, as a father; it's
easy for me as the President because the system is going to work
and I will not intervene. I've not discussed this with any
officials and suggested any outcome.
   But what father wouldn't express a certain confidence in the
honor of his son? And that's exactly the way I feel about it, and I
feel very strongly about it. And for those who want to challenge
it, whether they're in the Congress or elsewhere, let the system
work and then we can all make a conclusion as to his honor and his
integrity.
   And it's tough on people in public life to some degree. And I've
got three other sons and they all want to go to the barricades,
every one of them, when they see some cartoon they don't like,
particularly those that are factually incorrect in total _ total
demeaning of the honor of their brother. They want to _ they want
to do what any other _ any other kids would do. And I say, ``You
calm down now, we're in a different role now. You can't react like
you would if your brother was picked on in a street fight. That's
not the way the system works.'' But we have great emotions that I
share with Barbara, I share with my sons and my daughter that I
won't share with you, except to say: One, as President I am
determined to stay out of this and let it work and let it work
fairly. And secondly, I have confidence in the honor and integrity
of my son, and if the system finds he's done something wrong he
will be the first to step up and do what's right.
   Q: Does that same confidence, sir, extend to William Seidman who
has _
   A: I am _
   Q: _ Democrats as well as Republicans _
   A: He wouldn't be there if I _ well, I guess I don't know about
_ about _ I was about to say he wouldn't be there if I didn't have
confidence in him. I have confidence in his integrity and his
honor. Last question.
   Q: Mr. President, the environmental groups that were very much
in evidence here don't seem too happy with the results of the
summit.
   A: Hey, they haven't seemed happy with me for a long time. And
I'm not too happy with them. And I think their grading system is
absolutely essentially absurd. But what's the question?
   Q: Well, sir, the question is, they're calling your forestation
initiative a fig leaf to cover up your inaction on the environment.
A second portion of this question is, why did you leave Bill Reilly
home when last year you brought him to Paris when you weren't even
planning to put him in the Cabinet?
   A: Yeah, last year many of the environmental ministers were
there and including some of the people _ you remember that was the
Paris centennial _ and many from other countries were there as
well. So, he was not here for that reason, nor were other
secretaries whose counterparts were not here. So that was the
reason. This is predominantly an economic summit, but lest anybody
have any doubt about it, Bill Reilly retains my full confidence and
my full support. I have great respect for him.
   What was the rest of your question?

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Scattered Across Ohio Valley, Middle Atlantic Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms that lingered in the Ohio Valley posed
the threat of more heavy rain, large hail, damaging winds, and
flash flooding Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, storms extended from New Mexico across Missouri and
northern Arkansas to the Middle Atlantic States and southern New
England.
   A fast-moving storm pelted metropolitan Denver with golf
ball-size hail and heavy rain Wednesday, triggering a series of
thunderstorm and tornado warnings.
   There were reports of dozens of shattered windows and some
flooding along the roads.
   Hot, humid air in the Southeast produced showers and
thunderstorms in Alabama, southern Florida, and the central Gulf
Coast region. A thunderstorm in northern Georgia produced high
winds which blew a tree onto a house at Tunnel Hill Wednesday
afternoon.
   Showers were scattered in South Dakota and Minnesota, and a few
showers also dotted the Pacific Coast region.
   Sunny skies prevailed across the northern Plateau, Great Basin,
and the northern and central Rocky Mountains.
   Temperatures were generally in the 70s and upper 60s across the
north-central Plains and Northeast. But readings were in the 90s
from Texas to the southern half of the Atlantic Coast.
   Record high temperatures for the date were set Tuesday at
Beckley, W.Va., 88, Columbia, S.C., 105, Greensboro, N.C., 99,
Raleigh, N.C., 98, Roanoke, Va., 97, Tampa, Fla., 96. Tied for the
record were Greenville, S.C. 98, Redding, Calif., 108, and Paducah,
Ky., 101.
   Temperatures in the West were again into the 90s as far north as
Washington state. Northern and central Pacific Coast readings were
in the 60s and 70s at midday, while southwestern deserts
temperatures ranged from the 90s to above 100 degrees.
   The nation's low Wednesday morning was 39 at West Yellowstone,
Mont.

<TEXT>
   Q: Why _ they call the forestation initiative a fig leaf to
cover up your inaction on global warming.
   A: Oh, I can't _ look, come on, I'm not going to respond to
those groups that have been attacking us every time we turn around.
And you cannot _ you cannot appeal _ I have to be careful because
there were some reasonable people involved. But on the
environmental extreme, they don't want this country to grow.
   They don't want _ and they don't want to take _ look down the
road at the human consequence of men and women thrown out of work
and families put into a whole new state of anxiety. And I, as
president, have to be concerned about that, as well as being a good
custodian, a good steward for the environment.
   And so _ but we cannot govern by listening to the loudest voice
on the extreme of an environmental movement. And I did not rely
heavily on them for support in getting elected president of the
United States, and I'm not going to be persuaded that I can get
some brownie point by appealing to one of these groups or other.
   And the attacks that they made on some of my summit partners, I
resent them too, because it's not just the United States and
attacking the President, it's _ or the policies of the government,
it's the attack on some of these other leaders. So they're entitled
to their opinion, their signs can be held just as high as others
and their rating systems can attract as much or as little attention
as you care to give them. But I am not going to shape the policies,
when I know we have sound environmental policies, by the loudest
voice or the biggest sign. And so it's _ they're welcome to
Houston. I hope they've enjoyed it, I hope they feel they've had an
opportunity to get their message out.
   But I had a little cloakroom conversation with some of the
participants and I think most of them are disinclined to change
policies in their countries that they think are sound because of
some of the statements that I saw and perhaps some that you were
referring to here.
   So, I'd say welcome and we'll listen and keep trying to do
better, but I am determined that we can find a sound environmental
path _ and I think we've found it _ continue to be good stewards
for the environment, and still have some concern for the working
man and the working woman in this country. And that really is what
it boils down to when you talk about no growth. And I'm not going
to talk about no growth for the United States because I feel a deep
concern about the human equation as well as the environment.
   So I was very pleased with the _ the mood amongst the summit
leaders as the result of the common ground that we hammered out on
the environment here.
   Thank you all very much.

   Harvard University plans to purchase
about $5 million Ecuadoran debt to fund a pioneering scholarship
program aimed at easing the country's financial burdens, officials
said Wednesday.
   ``It's a rather special situation that provides a model that
could be built on for other countries in similar circumstances,''
Harvard President Derek C. Bok said.
   The elaborate ``debt-for-scholarship swap'' essentially takes a
lose-lose situation and turns it into an all-around winner by
converting a portion of Ecuador's $11 billion foreign debt into
cash for education. The Colorado-sized South American country's
debt burden gets reduced, its U.S. creditors get rid of bonds they
fear will never be repaid and Harvard gets some of Ecuador's top
scholars.
   ``Harvard is the only one I know of doing this,'' said Robert H.
Scott, the school's vice president for finance.
   Scott worked with Ecuadoran Vice President Luis Parodi in
developing the program. The agreement was signed here Monday.
   Here's how it works:
   _Harvard purchases $5 million of Ecuadoran debt for $750,000 in
the form of discounted loan certificates from U.S. banks eager to
remove the loans from their books.
   _The university then donates the certificates to the Fundacion
Capacitar, an Ecuadoran education fund, which can exchange them
locally at the nation's central bank for government bonds worth 50
percent of the loan's face value, or about $2.5 million.
   _Fundacion Capacitar then sells the bonds on the securities
market for $2.5 million in local currency, which is then invested
in dollar-denominated securities that will be used as an endowment
to support Harvard scholarships for about 70 Ecuadoran students
during the next 10 years.
   The $100,000 to $200,000 annual scholarships were expected to
fund five to eight Ecuadoran students at Harvard by the fall of
1991, officials said.
   ``This is a very attractive way to develop a financial base to
provide for the financial aid costs of students from Ecuador,''
said Bok, who has announced he will leave Harvard next year after
20 years as president.
   ``Through the debt-swap we're able to leverage the investment we
make by several times in order to provide a larger fund.''
   Harvard officials said they plan to discuss creating similar
programs in other Latin American countries.
   Gerard Cassidy, a bank analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc. in
Boston, predicted many commercial lenders would be eager to sell
their debt in secondary markets, even at depressed prices.
   ``It's a creative way of solving a very difficult situation,''
he said. ``It's not a panacea, ... but it shows the kind of
creativeness that is needed.''
   Such debt-swap plans have cropped up in several Latin American
nations in recent years. Many have been funded by northern European
and U.S. environmental groups who want to protect rain forests and
national parks.
   ``The nice thing about these conversions is that they foster
some social goals that governments haven't always been able to
address ... because they've been financially strapped,'' said Tom
Fullerton, an economist with the WEFA Group, formally Wharton
Econometrics, of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   The Ecuadoran government has in recent years been looking for a
way out of the debt it accrued in the mid-1980s, when world oil
prices dropped and an earthquake severed a trans-Andean pipeline
through the nation of about 10 million people.
   Ecuadoran officials are negotiating a debt-restructuring program
that would could reduce their interest rates or up to 70 percent of
the principal owed.
   Fullerton said the scholarship plan was a ``step in the right
direction'' but cautioned that it will dissolve only a fraction of
Ecuador's hefty debt, which includes $6 billion owed to foreign
commercial banks.
   ``The amount that we're dealing with is very small compared with
total Ecuadoran debt overseas,'' he said. ``But it addresses an
important social goal and will help improve the human capital
available in Ecuador.''

provisionally terms of the Convention. We welcome the conclusion of
the UN Special Session on Drugs and urge the implementation of the
measures contained in the Program of Action it has adopted. We
support the declaration adopted at the ministerial meeting on drugs
convened by the United Kingdom that drug demand reduction should be
accorded the same importance in policy and action as the reduction
of illicit supply. Developed countries should adopt stronger
prevention efforts and assist demand reduction initiatives in other
countries.
   We endorse the report of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
and commit our countries to a full implementation of all its
recommendations without delay. As agreed at the May meeting of Task
Force Finance Ministers, the FATF should be reconvened for a second
year, chaired by France, to assess and facilitate the
implementation of these recommendations, and to complement them
where appropriate. Effective procedures should be adopted to ensure
that precursor and essential chemicals are not diverted to

   The company that built faulty mirrors on the
Hubble Space Telescope also gave a subcontractor reversed drawings
for Hubble guidance parts in 1981, according to government
documents obtained by The Associated Press.
   The backward blueprints drawn by prime contractor Perkin-Elmer
Corp. forced the company in 1981-82 to pay the same subcontractor
to rebuild a Hubble tower assembly part used to aim the telescope.
   Lewis Rinker, deputy NASA inspector general, said the tower
assembly guidance system did not cause the blurred focus on the
telescope's mirrors. But the faulty engineering plans for the
guidance part were drawn during the same period when the Danbury,
Conn., company was grinding and polishing the defective Hubble
mirrors.
   The disclosure came in an audit released to the AP under the
Freedom of Information Act. It is the first public indication that
NASA knew nearly a decade ago of problems in Perkin-Elmer's
engineering work.
   Errors by Perkin-Elmer, now known as Hughes Danbury Optical
Systems Corp., also allowed the assembly part subcontractor,
Composite Optics Inc., of San Diego, Calif., to make a profit of
more than 63 percent rebuilding the assembly part, according to a
1988 audit by NASA's inspector general.
   Normal NASA contracts have a 10 percent to 15 percent profit.
NASA auditors consider profits over 25 percent to be excessive.
   The audit also criticized Perkin-Elmer and other NASA prime
contractors for awarding subcontracts without competitive bids and
for overpaying some subcontractors.
   Hughes Danbury spokesman Thomas Arconti said Wednesday the
company was ``in the process of obtaining a complete copy of the
inspector general report and will have no specific comment on it
until we review it.''
   The 1988 audit and two others released Tuesday night also
concluded:
   _The purchasing system at Perkin-Elmer, which makes key spy
satellite equipment, failed to meet Defense Department standards in
February 1987. Rinker said that should have triggered closer
supervision of all its government contracts. He said the Pentagon
found the company was not properly justifying no-bid subcontracts
or analyzing subcontractor costs.
   _Acting just before auditors arrived in 1987, NASA belatedly
approved some Perkin-Elmer subcontracts issued between 1981 and
1985.
   _Four of 17 Lockheed Missile and Space Co. subcontracts on the
Hubble exceeded normal profit margins. Rinker said Lockheed was
seeking refunds but has not obtained any.
   _Perkin-Elmer sided with a subcontractor whose labor cost
estimates were challenged by Defense Department auditors. As a
result, the subcontractor made a profit of more than 26 percent,
instead of 15 percent called for in the subcontract.
   _The taxpayers may have paid for up to $108,000 a year in
personal long-distance telephone calls by workers at the Hubble
ground station at Johns Hopkins University.
   _NASA may have overpaid incentive bonuses by $1 million to
Perkin-Elmer and Lockheed between 1977 and 1987 on the Hubble
telescope because of the way cost overruns were allocated.
   The 1988 audit found that six of 11 Perkin-Elmer subcontracts on
the Hubble had profits greater than 15 percent. The auditors
calculated that five of those subcontracts produced a total of
$98,000 in excess profits. They recommended NASA seek refunds for
that money.
   Rinker said in an interview that Hughes Danbury had been seeking
refunds from the subcontractors, but ``so far nothing has been
returned to the government.''
   ``It's difficult to get money back from the subcontractor on
fixed-price contracts unless there was defective pricing,'' Rinker
said. Citing the second Composite Optics subcontract, Rinker said,
``We expect not to be charged twice for the same part.''
   Perkin-Elmer ordered the guidance part from Composite Optics in
July 1981.
   ``However, during assembly at the Perkin-Elmer facilities, it
was discovered that the prime contractor had furnished Composite
Optics engineering drawings in reverse of what was needed,'' the
auditors found.
   The audit said Composite Optics acknowledged it salvaged a
significant portion of the backward guidance part. But, the
auditors said, ``Perkin-Elmer did not make any reductions to the
subcontractor's proposed costs'' in December 1981 when it gave out
a new contract to rebuild the part.
   David Chamberlain, director of administration at Composite
Optics, said he doubted many parts were salvageable.

   A Ukrainian protege of Mikhail S. Gorbachev was
elected Wednesday to be his right-hand man in the Communist Party,
the Tass news agency reported, in a stinging rebuff to the party's
leading traditionalist.
   Vladimir Ivashko, the man Gorbachev picked to run the Ukrainian
republic last fall, was elected to the post of deputy general
secretary of the Communist Party by delegates to the 28th party
congress, Tass reported, citing ``trustworthy sources.''
   Ivashko defeated Politburo conservative Yegor K. Ligachev, who
has been Gorbachev's most vocal hard-line critic. Ivashko has been
a member of the party's ruling Politburo since December.
   In its brief report, Tass did not give any vote totals from the
secret ballot held Wednesday night. The results were to be
officially announced on Thursday at the congress.
   Ivashko, a 58-year-old economist and engineer, will run the
party's day-to-day affairs. Gorbachev, who was re-elected as party
leader on Tuesday, had sought a protege to handle those tasks while
he concentrates on his presidential duties.
   Ivashko's election gave Gorbachev a further triumph at the
congress. It showed his personal strength at a congress that has
been dominated the past nine days by conservatives who have
criticized his reforms.
   It was also a personal repudiation of Ligachev. On Tuesday,
Moscow party boss Yuri Prokofiev told reporters that he thought
Ligachev's political career was over.
   Meanwhile, about 500 anti-Communist demonstrators rallied on the
edge of Red Square, and shook their fists in the face of departing
delegates. One man spat at a delegate, and police had to hold back
many of the protesters, who whistled derisively or shouted
``Shame!'' and ``Resign!''
   ``Communism, go away!'' said Maya Ivanova, who described herself
as a supporter of Boris N. Yeltsin, the reform president of the
Russian republic.
   The crowd, which waved czarist flags and anti-Communist placards
such as ``Communism is Worse than AIDS,'' listened to speakers
through a megaphone that didn't always work. Scores of uniformed
police kept protesters off the cobblestones of Red Square, and
undercover agents milled at the rally's edges, speaking into
plastic bags that concealed their walkie-talkies.
   The vote between Ivashko and Ligachev gave delegates a clear
choice between giving Gorbachev a loyal deputy or saddling him with
a rival in charge of day-to-day party affairs. A third candidate,
Leningrad professor Anatoly Dudaryev, also was on the ballot.
   Ligachev, who eight days earlier had been applauded by the
largely conservative congress for his harsh criticism of
Gorbachev's policies, almost didn't make it onto the ballot for the
No. 2 job.
   Hours after nominations had closed, Gorbachev told the congress
that the rules required a final vote certifying the ballot. Several
delegates promptly rose to complain that Ligachev did not truly
support Gorbachev's reform program.
   The congress then voted 2,293 to 1,916 to drop Ligachev from the
ballot.
   But other delegates immediately objected. One argued that the
congress was the party's ruling body and could change its own
rules. So the group voted 2,349 to 1,816 to ignore the ballot
certification requirement and restore Ligachev's candidacy.
   Afterward, delegate Dr. Svyatislav Fyodorov said he believed
Gorbachev engineered the incident. Ligachev told reporters: ``It
was just a procedural question. Don't look for politics in it.''
   Ligachev also fought off a bid from the floor to prevent him
from running because of his age. Ligachev is 69, and two efforts to
require the deputy leader to be younger than 60, and then 65, both
failed.
   Ligachev, who stumbled badly when speaking to delegates and
frequently forgot questions, told delegates he had worked well with
Gorbachev. He spoke against allowing private property in the Soviet
Union.
   Gorbachev chose Ivashko to run the Ukraine, the Soviet Union's
second-largest republic, when party traditionalist Vladimir V.
Shcherbitsky retired last fall.
   ``It is important that these two people be close,'' Gorbachev
said of the two top party leaders.
   ``As much as I have before, no matter what my job, I will be
working for perestroika,'' pledged Ivashko. ``We have to do
everything to renew the party and change its priorities.''
   ``We have to understand that without us, without the party,
nothing will be left of perestroika,'' he said in a forceful
presentation to the delegates.
   Ivashko resigned the party leadership of the Ukraine this spring
after he was elected president of the republic. He offered his
resignation as the Ukraine's president Wednesday, the Tass news
agency said.
   The Ukrainian parliament had urged all of its members to return
to the Ukraine for a key decision on the republic's sovereignty.
Many, including Ivashko, were at the party congress.
   Tass quoted Ivashko as saying that he was offering to resign
because he felt a lack of support from parliament.

   Six weeks of hot, dry weather have seared
corn, soybean, cotton and tobacco crops in the Southeast, but farm
experts looked hopefully for weekend rains that could avert an
agricultural disaster.
   Karl Harker, an agricultural meteorologist with the National
Weather Service at Auburn University in Alabama, said a low
pressure system will move into the region as early as Thursday,
increasing the likelihood of showers and thunderstorms.
   ``My farm is on irrigation, but our water supply is gone,'' said
Albert Johnson, who owns a 53-acre farm in South Carolina. ``The
extreme heat is making tobacco do things that I've never seen
before. ... The tobacco is literally baking.''
   Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin said without
significant rain in the next two weeks, farmers could face their
worst disaster since the 1986 drought.
   ``We're at a crossroads,'' he said. ``If it doesn't improve, we
stand to be worse than then.''
   Irvin said farmers need a break in the heat and two or three
days of light showers to soak the ground.
   Harker said 30-day rainfall totals in Georgia are running 2 to 6
inches below normal.
   The weather service said North Carolina averaged 1.25 inches in
June, instead of the usual four inches.
   South Carolina has shortfalls of two to five inches, according
to the Southeast Regional Climate Center in Columbia, S.C.
   The center's director, John Purvis, said Tennessee also has been
dry. Nashville's shortfall is 9.14 inches since Jan. 1.
   Irvin said the drought has severely damaged Georgia's corn crop,
has killed soybean plants and is expected to substantially reduce
cotton yields.
   It has also lowered milk production, forced farmers to feed
their cattle hay normally reserved for winter, has lowered egg
production and has reduced the weight of chickens.
   South Carolina officials said corn, tobacco and soybeans have
been hardest hit.
   Joe Burns, a crop specialist with the University of Tennessee
Agricultural Extension Service, estimated that farmers in eastern
Tennessee are losing about 400,000 bushels of corn a day _ or about
$1 million a day _ because of the drought.
   Tobacco, the main cash crop in eastern Tennessee, have virtually
stopped growing, said Charles Farmer, an Extension Service
economist.
   ``It's an iffy situation,'' Farmer said. ``I think we can still
make some good crops if we get some moisture pretty soon. But
obviously we have lost some ground.''
   North Carolina's tobacco crop is protected by irrigation on most
farms, but corn has withered in some fields, officials said. Most
of the state's 1.25 million acres of corn is in the hard-hit
eastern part of the state.
   Columbus County extension director Garland McMullen said farmers
in his county will lose about half their corn.
   ``We have some areas ... the farmers will not be able to harvest
at all,'' he said. ``There's no ears on the stalk.''
   Carl Cross, a statistician with the North Carolina Agriculture
Department in Raleigh, said only an eighth of the state's corn crop
was rated good this week, compared to one-third last week.

   When Ukrainian coal miners learned at a
rally Wednesday their republic's president might be moving to a top
Communist Party post in Moscow, they cheered and applauded.
   It was not happiness for a local boy making good. It was more
pleasure at the prospect of getting rid of Vladimir Ivashko.
   ``He's a windbag. He doesn't do anything,'' said Anatoly
Berezhnikov, one of about 3,000 angry miners demonstrating in the
heart of the Ukraine's coal fields during a one-day strike to press
demands that the Communist Party get out of their lives and the
Soviet government resign.
   Ivashko defeated fellow Politburo member Yegor Ligachev for the
No. 2 Communist Party job in a vote Wednesday night at the 28th
party congress in Moscow, the official Tass news agency reported.
   Ivashko, a protege of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, will
run the party's day-to-day affairs in his new post as deputy
secretary general. This will allow Gorbachev to concentrate on his
duties as Soviet president. dispute with the republic's parliament.
   Ivashko also offered his resignation as Ukrainian president
Wednesday in a dispute with the republic's parliament.
   Miners here in the Soviet Union's biggest coal-producing region
admit they don't know Ivashko well because he has been in the
Ukrainian leadership only since last fall.
   But still they cast him as a part of the Communist Party and
government apparatus that has failed to improve their living and
working conditions.
   ``Have you been around to the stores?'' the 34-year-old
Berezhnikov, who has spent 13 years in the mines, asked a reporter
interested in his view of Ivashko. Without awaiting an answer, he
offered: ``They're empty.''
   The cigarettte-smoking miner said Ivashkov must share the blame
along with the rest of the republic's leaders. The officials, he
said, ``are fighting for power and doing nothing for us.''
   But there was a dissenter in the crowd. The wife of a miner said
she respects Ivashko and thinks it will be a loss for the Ukraine
if he moves to Moscow.
   ``You can sense his knowledge. He's not stupid and has common
sense. He knows how to assess things and propose what is needed,''
said the woman, who would identify herself only as Ludmilla.
   Ivashko, a 58-year-old economist and engineer, is much more
closely identified with Gorbachev than the former Ukrainian leader,
Vladimir Shcherbitsky, a party traditionalist.
   Speaking to the party congress on Wednesday, Ivashko pledged
total support for Gorbachev's policies.
   Organizers of the one-day national miners strike said they
weren't happy with any of the proposed candidates for the No. 2
party job.
   ``Ligachev and Ivashko are from the same regime. There's no way
we can support him,'' Yuri Makarov, a Donetsk strike organizer,
told a news conference.
   Another organizer, Yuri Boldyrev, said the miners had all but
given up on the party.
   ``We don't have hope for a party headed by either Ligachev or
Ivashko,'' he said.

<HEAD>City Hall Welcomes Democratic Convention</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins told the Democratic Party on
Wednesday it won't be disappointed it chose his city for its 1992
national convention.
   ``We won't let you down,'' Dinkins told Democratic National
Chairman Ronald Brown, an old friend. ``New York is a great
convention town.''
   Brown came to New York after announcing in Washington that his
hometown was chosen as the convention site. The gathering should
bring 35,000 delegates, guests and journalists to town and pump an
estimated $100 million into the city's economy.
   ``Democrats will nominate the next president of the United
States two years from now this week in America's most dynamic city
and in one of the world's greatest cities _ New York, the Big
Apple,'' Brown said.
   The race to be that nominee is wide open, but one possibility _
Gov. Mario Cuomo _ was on hand for the hoopla at City Hall. Cuomo
added his signature to a contract signed by Dinkins and Brown, then
parried reporters' questions about national office.
   ``I have no plans to run for president,'' Cuomo said. ``I have
no plans to make plans,'' he continued, adding with a laugh, ``You
guys don't believe me. It's too bad.''
   Political experts say New York's selection as host would help a
Cuomo candidacy only in the unlikely event the convention is
contested.
   ``I don't think it matters where the convention is because
that's the end of the process,'' said former Iowa Democratic Party
Chairwoman Bonnie Campbell. ``Certainly it makes it easier for the
governor if he's our nominee. He won't have to travel as far.''
   At a flag-bedecked City Hall, Dinkins and Brown sat at a desk
that belonged to George Washington and a band played ``Happy Days
Are Here Again.''
   The two men engaged in some Republican-bashing, stressing the
savings and loan bailout.
   Dinkins said $500 billion was being spent to bail out the ailing
thrifts, adding: ``We must not ask honest borrowers and businesses
to bail out the savings and loan stockholders, the big depositors
and, in many cases, the same crooks and thieves who caused this
mess in the first place.''
   He said he hoped the '92 convention would be ``a time to renew
America's progressive values and principles.''
   Brown said the S&amp;L crisis lay in the laps of President Bush and
former President Reagan.
   ``It happened on their watch,'' he said. ``It's the fox and the
chicken coop with no prosecution of the thieves.''
   Brown said he was considering several format changes for the
convention, including cutting it to three days from four and
holding it on a weekend instead of midweek.
   The site selection committee had narrowed its search to New York
and New Orleans. Brown said New Orleans' chances were hurt by the
Louisiana Legislature's passage of strong anti-abortion
legislation, but said that was not the deciding factor.
   New York's early pledge to come up with more than $20 million to
get Madison Square Garden ready for the convention, and a promise
by prominent Democratic fund-raisers here to fill the party's
coffers, helped persuade Brown the Big Apple was the place to go.
   New York played host to the convention in 1976, when Jimmy
Carter was nominated and won the presidency, and in 1980, when
Carter was renominated and lost.

   Spurned by the Democrats, who chose New York
City to host their 1992 national convention, New Orleans officials
Wednesday said they would try to get the Republicans.
   Mayor Sidney Barthelemy's chief of staff, Terry Alarcon, said
Republican officials on Tuesday asked New Orleans to start working
on a proposal to play host to the 1992 GOP convention.
   ``They said we set the standard'' in 1988, when the Republican
convention was held at the Louisiana Superdome, Alarcon said.
   Economists estimated the 1988 convention pumped up to $130
million into the New Orleans economy. For weeks, New Orleans had
been battling New York for the 1992 Democratic do.
   Alarcon and Steve Hand, who led the New Orleans campaign, said
New York edged out their city because the Democrats want the Big
Apple's access to big-money individuals and corporations. Both have
been in relatively short supply in New Orleans since the oil
industry declined in the early 1980s.
   ``We feel like New York won based on one very simple reason,''
said Alarcon. ``It is the financial capital of this nation.''
   In Washington Wednesday, Democratic Chairman Ron Brown said ``a
factor but not the deciding factor'' was the Lousiana Legislature's
recent passage of the toughest sta divisions some unions would accept women
as pastors, but
indications are that the majority of unions do not find this
acceptable.''
   The delegates' vote against ordaining women is binding on all
congregations within the church.
   A vote to close off the debate Wednesday morning prevented 45
delegates from taking their turns at the microphone.
   During Tuesday's two-hour debate, many of those supporting the
ordination of women referred to Ellen G. White, an early church
leader thought by some Seventh-day Adventists to be a prophet.
   ``We need to liberate the Holy Spirit to do his work with
whomever he chooses to do his work with,'' said Stella Greig,
representing Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Mich. ``If God
can ordain women, as Ellen White told us he did her, I cannot see
why the Seventh-day Adventist Church cannot also ordain women.''
   Delegates opposing the ordination of women relied on the Bible,
which provides the guiding principles for the 127-year-old church.
   Gabriel Boakye-Dankwa of the church's African division urged
other delegates to resist social pressures.
   ``The Bible is silent on the ordination of women; the writings
of Ellen G. White are silent on the ordination of women and we
should also be silent,'' Boakye-Dankwa said. ``If it is in the
Bible we want it. If it is not in the Bible, this church must
reject it.''

<HEAD>Syrian Official Says Israeli Raids in Lebanon Hurt Hostage Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Syrian foreign minister said
Wednesday that Israeli air raids into Lebanon had complicated
negotiations for the release of one of the 16 Western hostages held
by Lebanese Moslem groups.
   In Lebanon, a senior Hezbollah official called for the release
of all Western hostages and Lebanese detainees held by Israel,
reiterating the pro-Iranian group's standard posture that it is not
involved in kidnappings.
   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was the first official
to confirm a weekend report by Iran's official news agency that a
hostage, most likely a European, might be freed soon. Syria is the
main powerbroker in Lebanon.
   Most of the six American and 10 European hostages are believed
held by pro-Iranian zealots operating under the umbrella of
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Sharaa said the Israeli raids Sunday and Monday against
Hezbollah bases in southern Lebanon had ``undermined our efforts''
to secure the release of a hostage. At least 15 people died in the
raids.
   There was no immediate reaction by the Israeli government to
Syria's remarks.
   The Syrians were instrumental in the release of U.S. hostages
Robert Polhill on April 22 and Frank Reed on April 30. Both were
freed in Lebanon and immediately taken to neighboring Syria before
going on to the United States.
   Syria maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate from 1976, a year after Lebanon's
Christian-Moslem civil war began. The Syrians control west Beirut
and Moslem regions.
   ``The Israeli air raids into Lebanon have complicated the issue,
and undermined our efforts,'' said Sharaa.
   The remaining Western hostages in Lebanon are six Americans and
10 Europeans _ four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an
Irishman and an Italian.
   ``We ask all those holding the hostages and those holding our
detainees as well to release them,'' said Mohammed Yazbed, a member
of Hezbollah's higher command.
   ``We are against such operations (kidnappings), and support the
freedom of individuals,'' he said in Baalbek, Lebanon, at the
funeral of two Hezbollah members killed in Israel's last air raid
Monday.
   Hezbollah officials often have made such statements in their
effort to distance themselves from the kidnappings. But Western
intelligence sources insist Hezbollah is an umbrella for
underground factions holding most of the hostages.
   Syria, Iran and allied Palestinian and Lebanese factions contend
that Western support of Israel encourages the Jewish state's
attacks against Arabs.
   Sharaa said in Damascus that he had no tangible developments to
report, but it is ``not unlikely'' that situation would change soon.
   He indirectly confirmed speculation in Beirut, London and Dublin
that the hostage to be released is Irish educator Brian Keenan.
   ``Syria is in constant contact with Iranian government officials
and we are also in contact with the Irish government,'' Sharaa
said. `We are exerting efforts and we hope that these efforts will
be successful.''
   Asked when a release might take place, Sharaa said, ``I can't
tell you anything now.''
   He did not elaborate on the snags that followed the air raids,
but said, ``I hope we will overcome these difficulties.''
   Keenan, 39, was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut on April 11,
1986, as he walked from his home to the American University of
Beirut, where he taught English.
   A native of Belfast, Keenan also holds a British passport.
   In Beirut, Shiite sources said this week Iran was pushing hard
for the release of a hostage to express appreciation for relief
supplies it received from the West after the devastating earthquake
June 21.
   Ireland sent one of the first relief shipments to Tehran after
the disaster in which 40,000 people were killed, 60,000 injured and
about half a million were left homeless.
   ``We continue to be very hopeful'' about the possible release of
Keenan, said Irish Ambassador Declan Connolly.
   He spoke to reporters after a meeting at the Foreign Ministry
with one of Sharaa's senior aides, Nasser Qaddour.
   Connolly flew in from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. On arrival, he
said he had come to Damascus to keep in closer touch with Syrian
officials to assess developments in a possible hostage release.
   ``We are hopeful on behalf of the Irish hostage Brian Keenan,''
he said, noting that he had ``good reason'' to expect a release.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani has been trying to end the
ordeal of the hostages in return for improved relations with the
West.
   But he faces growing opposition by Iranian radicals who believe
restoring ties with the West contradicts the teachings of the late
founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

   A rebel delegation headed by
Thomas Woewyu arrived here late Wednesday to open peace talks with
the beleaguered Liberian government of President Samuel Doe.
   The four rebel negotiators came here by sea from the rebel-held
port of Buchanan, about 60 miles southeast of Monrovia. They
arrived at the Sierra Leone government wharf after nightfall in a
heavy tropical rainstorm and were driven immediately to their hotel
in the resort suburb of Aberdeen.
   Woewyu, who resides in East Orange, N.J., told reporters he was
too tired to make any immediate statement but he might meet press
repesentatives Thursday. He said he had no plans for any immediate
meeting with the government delegation headed by Senate president
Tambakai Jangaba.
   Jangaba has been waiting for the rebel delegation to return to
Freetown since June 14 when a previous round of peace talks was
broken off. The two delegations conferred here under the protection
of the Sierra Leone government.
   Rebels have been advancing on the capital of Monrovia since
December in the hopes of disposing Doe.

<HEAD>Watkins Changing the Way DOE Does Business At Nuclear Waste Sites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James Watkins said Wednesday
his department will take more direct control of the contaminated
Hanford Nuclear Reservation as part of a plan to clean up problems
at the nation's nuclear weapons program.
   ``We are changing the way of doing business at one of our major
facilities. This is the first of a number of shoes to drop,''
Watkins said at a news conference.
   In addition to taking a greater government role in managing the
Hanford site at Washington state, Watkins said the Energy
Department will enter a new agreement with the Army Corps of
Engineers on Thursday to help clean up radioactive wastes at the
nation's nuclear weapons plants.
   Watkins said he was ``extremely disappointed'' with the
condition of the nuclear weapons plants when he initiated a 30-year
cleanup plan about 18 months ago.
   ``It was a shock to me. I had no idea we had not learned the
lessons of Three Mile Island,'' he said. ``Now is the time to pay
the piper and clean up 40 years of waste.
   The department announced last week it was increasing its
estimate of the cleanup costs nationally to nearly $30 billion over
the next five years.
   Watkins said Wednesday the boost was due partly to budget
officials who fear they will be subject to lawsuits if they don't
ask for enough cleanup money and partly to the discovery of
additional contamination.
   Watkins said the work one official currently performs at Hanford
will be handled by three deputies under his new management plan,
including one who will be directly responsible for waste cleanup.
   Also under the new plan, the new site manager John Wagoner will
report directly to the director of the department's office of
environmental restoration and waste management. Wagoner, deputy
manager of the Savannah River facility the past two years, replaces
Hanford site manager Mike Lawrence, who resigned last week to take
another job.
   ``Now we will have direct reporting from one of our major
sites,'' Watkins said.
   The Hanford site along the Columbia River near Richland, Wash.,
contains 600,000 cubic yards of radioactive waste, Watkins said.
   Disclosures in recent years show that dangerous contaminants
were released directly into the air, water and soil.
   Watkins said the Energy Department, which oversees the nation's
nuclear weapons plants, is trying to upgrade plant operations by
adding workers and administrators directly charged with improving
of safety.
   ``We need people in the plant walking, looking, being sensitive
to the health issues on a seven-day a week, 24-hour a day basis,''
he said. ``None of that's been done in the past. That is one of the
reasons we've been targeted and targeted so successfully by groups
who have legitimate complaints against us.''
   Watkins said details of the memo of understanding with the Army
Corps of Engineers will be made available on Thursday. He said more
specific plans for the agreement at Hanford are expected over the
next week with other site-specific plans to follow in the future.

   About 200 armed Mohawk Indians wearing war
paint fought off a police assault Wednesday in a dispute over plans
to expand a private golf course surrounded by tribal land. One
officer was killed.
   Provincial police officers in helmets, fatigues and gas masks
exchanged hundreds of rounds of bullets with the Indians and fired
tear gas and stun grenades during a battle over several hours.
   Police later retreated and both sides remained behind barricades
in a standoff. The Indians patrolled the edge of the disputed golf
course in stolen carts in preparation for another attack.
   On Tuesday, Oka Mayor Jean Ouellette had asked police to
intervene to enforce a court injunction ordering the removal of a
Mohawk barricade set up three months ago on the access road to the
disputed land.
   ``The reason we moved was because the Mohawks were breaking the
law,'' police spokesman Richard Bourdon said. ``They were blocking
a public road and this is a criminal act.''
   Mohawk tribe members reacted angrily to the police attack.
   ``I find it awful that police would attack our people,'' said
tribe member Eleanor Montour, 67.
   ``We're not savages, we're proud to be Mohawks. We were pushed
around for centuries and we're being pushed again and we're getting
awfully tired of it.''
   The dispute centers on land owned by the town of Oka since 1947.
The Indians have always maintained it is their land, and their
Kahnesetake settlement surrounds it.
   Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal, rents the land to the operators
of the private nine-hole course. The operators say they want to cut
down the white pine forest on the land and expand the course to 18
holes.
   Quebec's public security minister Sam Elkas insisted neither he
nor any other government official knew that provincial police were
headed to Oka. He said the police intervened at the request of Oka
municipal authorities.
   After the police warned Oka officials of the possible
consequences, the police then asked the Mohawks to leave the
barricade, Elkas said.
   ``They refused, at that point we went in to remove them, and
gunshots were fired,'' Elkas said.
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa blamed the violence on the
Mohawks.
   ``What we saw this morning was revolting and intolerable,'' said
Bourassa.
   ``We cannot accept the use of violence under any pretext, and
even less so when the use of such violence is directed at those
whose aim is to uphold the law,'' he said.
   But Mohawk spokesman Harvey Nicholas said the Indians were just
returning fire after police began shooting.
   ``They can shoot us down like animals, but we can't shoot
back,'' Nicholas said. ``People are getting killed because boys
want to run around and play golf.''
   Earlier this week, John Ciaccia, the minister responsible for
native affairs, pleaded with the Oka Town Council to put its plans
for the golf course expansion on hold.
   About 100 police officers in helmets, fatigues and gas masks
moved into the area at about 5:30 a.m. Wednesday. Shots were fired
and tear gas was lobbed into the Mohawk encampment near the
barricade, but nobody was hurt.
   After bringing up heavy equipment and placing snipers in trees
around the barricade, police staged an assault about 9 a.m. with
automatic weapons, stun grenades and more tear gas.
   Cpl. Marcel Lemay, 31, was shot in the face and was declared
dead about an hour later at nearby St. Eustache hospital.
   About 200 armed Mohawks wearing war paint and covering their
faces with bandannas fought the police assault from the barricade.
They were joined by about 100 women and children from the
1,000-member Kahnesetake community.
   The crackle of hundreds of rounds of gunfire was punctuated by
the thud of tear gas and stun grenades detonating just outside Oka.
   As the wind moved tear gas back across their lines, police
retreated toward Oka and the situation turned into a standoff.
   The Indians took advantage of the retreat to seize four police
cars and two vans, then used a commandeered front-end loader to
crush the vehicles to form a barricade on a hill across the main
highway through the region. Their position overlooked a police
roadblock at the bottom of the hill.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, in Houston for the
summit of the Western industrial powers, said he understood ``the
matter was being properly handled by the authorities in Quebec.''
   ``I have instructed my colleagues in Ottawa to make sure all
proper assistance is offered to the provincial authorities in
Quebec to bring the matter to a successful conclusion,'' he said.
   In a show of support for the Indians, armed Mohawks from the
Kahnawake reserve south of Montreal used pickup trucks and other
vehicles to set up roadblocks on two main highways leading to the
Mercier Bridge, blocking thousands of residents on the south shore
of the St. Lawrence River from getting to their jobs in Montreal.
   Three Mohawk men were arrested after they tried to flee a police
patrol in the area. A police officer was slightly injured after he
grabbed the door handle of the Indians' truck and was dragged for
about half-a-mile.
   Other Mowhawk settlements on or near the U.S.-Canadian border
have had similar confrontations with authorities.
   The Ganienkeh Mohawk encampment in northern New York was the
scene of an 11-day standoff March 30 after a National Guard
helicopter was shot down over Indian land.
   Police were called to the St. Regis Indian Reservation on the
U.S.-Canadian border after an inter-tribal gambling war resulted in
two shooting deaths May 1. Police remain on the reservation to this
day.

<HEAD>High-Tech Research Funding Advances in House Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The House approved Wednesday a bill
authorizing $290 million for the National Institute of Standards
and Technology and expanding government technology programs.
   The bill would authorize $50 million this year and $100 million
next year for the Advanced Technology Program, established in 1988
trade legislation to promote industrial consortiums in high-tech
areas such as high-definition television, superconductivity and
advanced manufacturing.
   It would authorize $250 million in fiscal 1992 for that
technology program. President Bush had requested only $10 million
for the progam, and Republicans mounted an unsuccessful effort to
strip the $250 million 1992 authorization from the bill.
   The House voted 327 to 93 to approve the bill.
   Grants under the Advanced Technology Program would be awarded to
research ventures on technology important for various industries,
but which no single company is likely to undertake on its own,
sponsors said. The Commerce Department would be required to
negotiate agreements to ensure the govermment receives a return on
its investment.
   Sponsors said the bill would help the United States be more
competitive in high-technology industries in world markets.
   Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., said the Bush administration wanted
no specific amount of money named in the bill for the Advanced
Technology Program and warned that Bush may veto the bill.
   Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., chairman of the Science, Space and
Technology Committee, responded: ``Every time we go to the bathroom
around here somebody says, `check with the White House, they're
going to veto.' Well, let them veto.''
   The bill would authorize $290.2 million in fiscal 1991 for the
National Institute of Standards and Technology, the federal agency
that regulates weights and measures. That figures includes money
for the technology program.
   A similar bill has passed the Senate, and differences will have
to be worked out in conference.

<HEAD>Brewers, Farmers Protest; EGerman Gov't Promises Price Crackdown</HEAD>

   East German beer brewers and farmers
temporarily blocked West German border crossings with their trucks
Wednesday to protest what they said is unfair competition from the
West.
   The government, meanwhile, threatened to close retail stores to
stop price gouging by former state-owned businesses now feasting on
the nation's new free market.
   The government said it would take tough measures to break up the
retail monopolies that have been charging arbitrarily high prices
in the country since it shifted to a market economy on July 1.
   East Germany merged its economy with West Germany's on that date
and began using the West German mark as its official currency.
   Former state-owned grocery and gas station chains that once sold
goods at government-set levels have raised many prices
dramatically, some of them even higher than in wealthy West Germany.
   Government spokesman Matthias Gehler said West German food
retailers agreed to send ``mobile shops'' with their goods to
compete against the East German firms.
   The government last week said it would break up the chains by
selling individual stores.
   The Cabinet of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere on Wednesday
issued an order saying that employees of the giant HO grocery and
retail chain would have the first opportunity to buy those stores.
   De Maiziere toured two grocery stores in East Berlin and
threatened to close shops and levy fines on stores guilty of price
gouging.
   He also criticized the fact that only 15 percent of the goods
sold in the stores he visited were produced in East Germany. The
rest were Western products.
   ``My impression confirms the reports I've read,'' he said. ``We
will see what we can quickly do about this.''
   East Germany's beer brewers blocked a West German border points
in the southwest corner of the country for about 30 minutes,
creating huge traffic snarls, the East German news agency ADN said.
   It said the domestic brewers have lost 90 percent of their
business since East Germany opened its doors to Western products on
July 1.
   Rainer Doetsch, head of the Castle Brewery, accused West German
brewers of ``dumping'' their beer in East Germany at below-market
prices.
   Meanwhile, farmers in the agricultural heartland of the north
blocked a main highway leading to the West German border with
scores of tractors and trucks, ADN said.
   Farmers say the refusal of East German retailers to stock their
goods in favor of West German products is denying them a chance to
compete.
   Many East German retailers have signed agreements with West
German grocery chains that prevent them from stocking many East
German goods in their stores.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Denies Selective Prosecution of Black Politicians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Wednesday
angrily denied suggestions by some civil rights leaders that the
Justice Department has targeted black politicians for prosecution.
   ``We are prosecuting people on the basis of whether or not there
is legally admissible evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
their wrongdoing regardless of race, religion or color or political
affiliation,'' Thornburgh said.
   The attorney general expressed disappointment that Benjamin L.
Hooks, executive director of the NAACP, had accused federal
prosecutors of targeting Washington Mayor Marion Barry and other
black officials while ignoring savings-and-loan fraud by rich
whites.
   Thornburgh told reporters at a luncheon that he had spoken to
Hooks privately about the criticism that the civil rights leader
had previously leveled at the Justice Department.
   ``Apparently his public response is to simply repeat these
allegations as he did earlier this week,'' Thornburgh said. ``It
disappointed me that he did.''
   Hooks, in an interview with The Washington Post, charged that
overzealous prosecutors had spent millions of dollars pursuing such
black politiicans as Barry while ignoring ``those lying, conniving,
thieving savings and loan officials who robbed this country blind.''
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., voice a similar charge that black
public officials were targeted for prosecution last spring when
Thornburgh testified before the House Judiciary Committee.
   ``That would be a pretty hard message to sell to former Gov.
Arch Moore, a white Republican who is now facing a long time in the
slammer,'' said the attorney general.
   The former West Virginia governor was sentenced this week to
nearly six years in prison for mail fraud, extortion, filing false
income taxes and obstruction of justice.
   Thornburgh said the department did not have any figures to rebut
the contention of black commentators that prosecutors spent
millions of dollars to obtain the drug possession and perjury
indictment of Barry, who is now on trial here.
   ``How can you put a price tag on justice? Our investigations
cost whatever it takes to get a conviction,'' Thornburgh said.
   Asked what steps he was taking to counter the perception that
black public officials are being singled out, Thornburgh said: ``I
don't know how you address false perceptions other than by inviting
people to look at the record.
   ``The record clearly indicates there is no such pattern of
prosecution,'' he said.
   The attorney general said the department does not compile
statistics on the race, religion or political affiliation or
criminal defendants that he contended would rebut the charges.
   ``Do you think it would make any difference?'' he said.
   Of 21 congressmen convicted of crimes relating to their conduct
in office since 1976, only one was black, according to a list
provided later in the day by the Justice Department. Former Rep.
Charles Diggs, D-Mich., was convicted of payroll padding.

   Artists, intellectuals and students said
Wednesday they would end their sit-down strike only if the
government agrees to work under a new president with no links to
the Communists.
   The strikers, camping in scores of tents dubbed ``the city of
truth,'' forced the resignation last Friday of President Petar
Mladenov, a former leading member of the governing Socialist Party,
which is the renamed Communist Party.
   The main opposition alliance, the 16-party Union of Democratic
Forces, has indicated it would nominate Petar Dertliev, the
respected 74-year-old leader of the Social Democratic Party, as the
UDF presidential candidate.
   But the leader of another influential party within the UDF said
Wednesday he opposed Dertliev's candidacy.
   Milan Drenchev, leader of the opposition Agrarian-Nikola Petkov
Party, charged the Social Democrats harbor many former Communists.
   Drenchev's reasoning for rejecting Dertliev contradicts
Dertliev's own account of his hardships under the Communists.
   Earlier this year, Dertliev said that as a Social Democratic
Party activist he had spent 10 years in prison for his political
activities after the Communist takeover.
   Drenchev ruled out a candidacy for himself.
   According to Bulgarian newspapers and analysts, other possible
candidates may be Zhivko Stalev, head of the Central Electoral
Commission, and Blagovest Sendov, president of the Academy of
Sciences. Both are considered unaffiliated.
   The Socialists won an absolute majority of 211 of Parliament's
400 seats in last month's multiparty elections. The UDF garnered
144 mandates, 32 of which went to the Agrarian-Nikola Petkov Party,
Drenchev said.
   The student demonstration, which began about a month ago, was
seen as significant because it has been joined by top scientists
and professors, including representatives of the Bulgarian Academy
of Sciences.
   The students began their protest because of alleged
manipulations in June's parliamentary elections, in which the
Socialists won a majority of seats.
   The demonstrators are also demanding a public trial of ousted
Communist leader Todor Zhivkov, under investigation for alleged
abuse of power, incitement to ethnic hatred and misappropriation of
state property.
   The demonstrators reiterated their other demands at an
improvised open-air news conference Wednesday. They want:
   _A new president who is not linked to the political and army
establishment.
   _Removal of parliamentary immunity from people implicated in the
running of prison camps in the 1950s, in the 1968 Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia and in the state persecution of ethnic
Turks in 1984-85.
   _And the ``whole truth'' revealed about the Bulgarian foreign
debt, now totaling about $10 billion, and about the property of the
ruling party and its former leaders.

   Miss America contestants will no
longer pose for photographers in swimsuits, but the swimsuit
competition will remain a part of the preliminary and final
contests, the pageant director said Wednesday.
   ``I personally find it difficult to rationalize putting a young
college woman in a swimsuit and high heel shoes,'' said Leonard
Horn, who feels the photo sessions no longer fit in with a pageant
he envisions as a scholarship contest.
   He noted, however, that pageant traditionalists oppose removing
that segment, adding, ``It's such an integral and traditional part
of the competition that I would be loathe to change it without an
alternative.''
   In years past, photo sessions with bathing suit-clad contestants
were held at sites around Atlantic City.
   Judges tally the score according to a formula that gives 15
percent each to the swimsuit and evening gown competitions, 30
percent for an interview with a preliminary panel of judges and 40
percent for talent.

   Marion Barry collapsed from a cocaine overdose
during a 1987 trip to the Super Bowl and friends helped cover up
the cause of his medical treatment, a lawyer testified Wednesday at
the mayor's drug and perjury trial.
   Lloyd Moore, who also described using drugs with the mayor, said
he learned of the cocaine overdose in January 1987 in a telephone
conversation with a friend of Barry's who was in Los Angeles with
Barry.
   Barry's friend, Jeffrey Mitchell, ``indicated that they had
smoked ... cocaine laced with something,'' Moore said of the phone
call.
   Barry was ``very sick. ... They thought he was going to die,''
Moore said Mitchell told him.
   Moore was the sixth prosecution witness to describe using drugs
with the three-term mayor. He followed to the stand Theresa
Southerland, a 27-year-old secretary who said she snorted cocaine
repeatedly from 1987 to 1989 at apartments and homes and on two
trips to the Bahamas.
   Barry is facing 10 counts of cocaine possession, one count of
conspiracy and three counts of lying to a grand jury about his
alleged involvement with drugs.
   Prosecutors are using the testimony of Moore, who was appointed
by Barry to the city boxing and arts commissions, to support a
charge that Barry conspired to conceal his cocaine use.
   Barry was hospitalized for what was officially described as a
hiatal hernia in 1987 in Los Angeles, where he had traveled to see
the New York Giants play the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl.
   In the phone call, Mitchell said he told hospital workers ``what
he would allow them to do,'' testified Moore. The hospital ``was
not allowed to take blood'' from the mayor, Moore said Mitchell
told him.
   Moore, who practices law in Washington, testified he and Barry
used cocaine together at Moore's home about six times from May 1986
to March 1987. Barry used cocaine by himself at Moore's home about
three times, Moore said, adding that he gave Barry cocaine ``a
couple of times,'' each time in an amount worth about $50.
   ``Thirteen times you saw the defendant use or possess cocaine in
your home?'' asked assistant U.S. attorney Richard Roberts.
   ``That is correct,'' replied Moore.
   Moore was appointed by Barry to the D.C. Boxing Commission and
the D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities.
   The testimony of Southerland, the second woman to testify about
having a romantic relationship with Barry, echoed statements by
other witnesses who said they had used drugs with the mayor at
Washington homes and in the Bahamas.
   ``I hit the cocaine and he hit the cocaine,'' Southerland said
of a March 1988 get-together with Barry at the Washington residence
of a friend of the mayor.
   ``I used my fingernail'' to snort the cocaine up her nose and
``he used a (business) card,'' she said of Barry.
   FBI tests last month turned up traces of cocaine on Barry's
business cards seized Jan. 18 when he was videotaped in a sting
operation smoking crack, according to earlier testimony.
   Southerland met the mayor at a Washington nightclub, became
romantically involved with him and the two started taking drugs in
November 1987, she said. They last used drugs last November, she
said.
   Southerland testified that ``Marion invited me'' to the Bahamas
around Thanksgiving 1987. She testified she was known to Barry's
group simply as ``T or Miss T.''
   In his hotel suite, Barry produced some cocaine, which was piled
atop a dollar bill, and the mayor took ``three or four hits,'' she
said. Restaurateur Hassan Mohammadi testified earlier that he had
given the cocaine for that trip to Barry in the mayor's office.
   Southerland said she also carried some cocaine with her on the
trip and the mayor snorted it with her.
   She said Barry also smoked opium, a drug she said she did not
like, at Mohammadi's home.
   Under cross-examination by Barry's lawyers, Southerland said she
and Barry often had ``five to eight shots'' of liquor each when
they used drugs.
   She admitted that she had been a cocaine user for about a year
before she met Barry and said she often supplied the drugs that the
two used.

<TEXT>
   The president of the American Chamber
of Commerce in the Philippines, who criticized government economic
policies, has left the country after receiving warnings that his
life was in danger, sources said Thursday.
   Mark Blacker, who is also first vice president of the American
Express Bank and executive director of the International Corporate
Bank, left for Hong Kong last week, sources in the business
community said.
   It was uncertain when he would return. His departure comes amid
increasing concern over security for about 140,000 Americans
residing in the Philippines.
   Officials of the chamber are not generally known outside the
business community. But Blacker had been in the news recently after
publicly criticizing President Corazon Aquino's government for
failing to provide incentives to foreign investors.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Blacker
was warned that Communist rebels planned to kill him.
   They said Blacker had been planning to go abroad anyway for eye
surgery but that the timing of his departure was influenced by
concern over his security.
   Communist rebels are believed to have killed eight Americans in
the Philippines since April 1989. All but two of them were U.S.
service members or affiliated with the military.
   In a statement last year, Romulo Kintanar, commander of the New
People's Army, said U.S. service members were the principal targets
and that the rebels would not harm ordinary civilians who were not
linked to the government's counterinsurgency program.
   Last month, the U.S. government withdrew all Peace Corps members
and suspended the program because of fears that the rebels would
try to kill or kidnap a volunteer.
   After the order, U.S. officials learned that one volunteer,
Timothy Swanson of Cheyenne, Wyo., had been held by the rebels on
Negros Island since June 13.
   The newspaper BusinessWorld said Blacker received a warning from
a U.S. official one day after he told foreign correspondents that
would-be investors were being driven from the Philippines because
of inadequate infrastructure and government indecision.
   ``I don't see any solution at hand,'' Blacker said in a meeting
with correspondents July 3. ``I don't know what they (government
agencies) are doing. I would like to see more unity of purpose
between everybody in this country.''
   Blacker's comments were widely reported in the Philippine media.
Some commentators claimed the remarks were part of an orchestrated
U.S. government plot to pressure the government to extend the lease
on the six American military bases, which expires in September 1991.

   The Mohawk Indians who live on the border between the United
States and Canada are again in conflict with the authorities. Here
is a look at their relations with the governments on both sides of
the border in recent years.
   1979 _ 20 ``traditionalists'' Mohawks were arrested after a
handful of Franklin County deputies were held hostage over the
cutting down of trees by tribal Mohawks who elect the tribe's
leaders.
   1980 _ New York State sends 70 heavily armed policemen onto the
reservation to head off a confrontation between tribal Mohawks and
traditionalist Mohawks.
   June 1989 _ State police complete a two-day raid on the St.
Regis Mohawk Reservation, arresting four people for illegal
gambling and confiscating more than 200 gambling machines.
   July 1989 _ 300 FBI agents and state troopers raid gambling
casinos on the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation, arresting 12 Mohawk
Indians on gambling charges. Following the raid, there is a 10-day
standoff between state and federal authorities and the Warriors
Society, a self-appointed Mohawk security force.
   August 1989 _ Shots are fired at a one of the gambling casinos
on the St. Regis Reservation in the latest round of violence
stemming from gambling on the Reservation.
   November 1989 _ Offices of a weekly pro-gambling newspaper on
the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation are hit by gunfire in further
violence over illegal gambling casinos.
   March 1990 _ A doctor aboard a Vermont National Guard

   The 15 republic Communist Party leaders to become
Politburo members under new rules adopted by the party congress
include traditionalists and reformers. Most want a deal with the
Kremlin to give the regions more autonomy.
   Following are thumbnail sketches:
   ARMENIA _ Vladimir Movsisyan took office in April, succeeding a
strong Armenian nationalist. Born in 1935, he has spent his entire
career in Armenia, specializing in agriculture. He is thought to be
a traditionalist inclined toward reforms, including more
sovereignty for the republics.
   AZERBAIJAN _ Ayaz N. Mutalibov leads a republic that has been
under martial law for six months due to ethnic rioting. Mutalibov
was elected in January after his predecessor was expelled from the
party. An economist and technocrat, Mutalibov worked at a household
appliance factory in the republic's capital of Baku before
switching to party work in 1977. In a 1989 interview in the
government newspaper Izvestia, he was quoted as saying it was
necessary to strengthen the economy before tackling social problems
such as unemployment.
   BYELORUSSIA _ Yefrem Sokolov supports glasnost and advocated
open discussions of public policy before President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev came to power in 1985. However, Byelorussia was one of
the last republics in which grassroots movements took hold and it
has acquired a reputation as a conservative backwater.
   ESTONIA _ The Estonian Communist Party plans to split this fall
into two factions, both of which are represented at the Congress.
The independent faction is led by chairman Vaino Vyalyas, a former
ambassador and Communist Youth League comrade of Gorbachev's youth,
and first secretary Enn Arno Sillari. The loyalist faction is led
by Alexander Gusev. It is not known which faction's leader would be
chosen for the Politburo.
   GEORGIA _ Givi Gumbaridze, an enthusiastic supporter of
Gorbachev and his reforms, was born in 1945, making him one of the
youngest republic party leaders. He was chairman of the KGB in the
southern republic for four months before taking over the party post
in April 1989, replacing a leader blamed for permitting a military
crackdown on demonstrators. Georgia is pushing for independence and
has a strong secession movement supported by many republic
Communist leaders.
   KAZAKHSTAN _ Nursultan Nazarbaev supports reforms to give his
Asian republic control of its natural resources and revive its
language. He wants to close the nuclear testing range at
Semipalatinsk. Born in 1940 and trained as a technocrat, he
advanced rapidly in the party and was elected first secretary in
June 1989. Speaking to the congress, he pleaded for clearer
direction from the Kremlin, likening current policy to ``an army
that is retreating in haste without a plan.''
   KIRGHIZIA _ Absomat Masaliyev is a traditionalist who feels
party leaders have not adequately defended the party from critical
attacks. He called for the safeguarding of communist ideals, saying
anything else would be a betrayal of whole generations of
communists. He repeatedly quoted Lenin to a congress that has
otherwise rarely referred to its former leader.
   LATVIA _ Alfreds Rubiks, 54, was listed by a Latvian youth
magazine in 1988 and 1989 as one of the most unpopular men in his
small Baltic republic. A career party worker, Rubiks came to
prominence as mayor of the capital city of Riga in 1984. Rubiks
opposed Latvia's independence declaration in May. The republic's
Communist Party has split, and Rubiks leads the majority pro-Moscow
faction. He complained at the congress that Communist parties were
too eager to make compromises with other groups.
   LITHUANIA _ Mikolas Burakevicius, a hard-liner, represents a
close-knit Communist group opposed to independence. His faction is
greatly outnumbered by the pro-independence faction led by Algirdas
Brazauskas, which was not invited to the party congress.
   MOLDAVIA _ Pyotr Luchinsky, a reformer, is a native of Moldavia,
which shares language and culture with bordering Romania and which
has declared itself sovereign with the right to overturn national
laws. Luchinsky, who took office in November 1989, says the earlier
the 15 republics obtain full self-reliance, the faster ethnic
tensions will subside. The son of peasants, Luchinsky studied
history and philosophy before launching a career in Moldavia's
Young Communist League. He worked in the party's propaganda
department in Moscow and was second-secretary in Tajikistan before
returning to Moldavia.
   RUSSIAN FEDERATION _ Ivan Polozkov, 55, swept to power on a tide
of conservatism last month at the reconstitution of the Russian
wing of the party. The previous month he narrowly lost the Russian
presidency to Boris Yeltsin. As party leader in the southern
Russian region of Krasnodar, Polozkov gained attention for a
vigorous campaign against cooperatives, the small, privately held
businesses permitted under Gorbachev's reforms. Polozkov, an
economist, says he's not as conservative as critics claim.
   TADZHIKISTAN _ Kakhar Makhkamov complained to the congress that
new social groups and parties criticize the Communist Party without
taking any responsibility themselves for society's problem. He
advocated a strong party and implied it was still virtually
indivisible from the government. However, he backed more
independence for republic parties and defended Gorbachev.
   TURKMENIA _ Sappar Niyazov appears to be a centrist trying to
steer a middle course on perestroika, but occasionally veers to the
right.
   UKRAINE _ Stanislav Gurenko, the newly elected party chief in
the second-largest republic, warned congress delegates not to
underestimate the dangers of anti-communism: ``We should rebuff
mud-slinging slander. We should not retreat from our positions, we
should stop committing suicide, we should stop this
self-flagellation.'' Gurenko faces anti-communist challenges in the
Don River coal-mining basin in the eastern Ukraine and in the
western region near Lvov.
   UZBEKISTAN _ Islam Karimov, 52, gave a cautious speech to the
congress, mildly criticizing central authorities for their handling
of ethnic disputes. He said he supported Gorbachev as party leader
but felt the party should not deviate from its core policy of
democratic centralism.

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday it needs
$2.2 billion a year in aid from industrialized countries to stop
the destruction of the Amazon, the world's largest wilderness.
   Science and Technology Secretary Jose Goldemberg said the money
would be used to replant deforested areas, relocate settlers and
patrol the Amazon to stop slash-and-burn devastation of the vast
jungle.
   Scientists say slash-and-burn destruction of Amazon rain forest
by ranchers and farmers releases carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
and adds to the greenhouse effect, which increases the Earth's
temperature.
   ``This wouldn't be charity,'' Goldemberg told The Associated
Press. ``The developed countries would be defending their own
interests by stopping the global warming.''
   An average of 8,700 square miles of rain forest has been cut and
burned each year since 1978, or about 8 percent of the
2-million-square-mile wilderness, Goldemberg said.
   He said the data was obtained from Brazil's Space Research
Institute, based on 222 Landsat satellite photos of the rain forest.
   Earlier estimates of Amazon destruction had ranged from 5 to 20
percent.

   Homeless Israelis living in tents throughout
the country on Wednesday blocked major road junctions and burned
tires as protests for housing solutions turned violent.
   In Tel Aviv, dozens of protesters burned tires at the Tel Kabir
junction. They were later dispersed by police, and no arrests were
reported.
   At the Housing Ministry in Jerusalem, 22-year-old Yaakov Azulai
poured petrol on his body and threatened to set himself on fire,
Israel radio reported.
   It said police and an ambulance crew called to the scene
persuaded Azulai not to go through with his threat.
   In downtown Jerusalem, hundreds of protesters marched toward the
Parliament and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's residence, blocking
roads on their way.
   Some demostrators scuffled with police who tried to force them
off the roads, witnesses said.
   There were no arrests or injuries, although one demostrator
fainted and was taken to a hospital. The protesters returned to
their tent encampment across from Israel's Parliament later
Wednesday.
   Rents have doubled and even tripled throughout Israel with the
arrival of Soviet immigrant wave, which has totalled more than
63,000 since 1989. It is expected to reach a total of 150,000 this
year.
   The demonstrations were the first violent protests by Israelis
forced out of their rented homes by the inflated housing prices.
   The immigrants, meanwhile, are beginning to experience housing
shortages themselves. A group of Soviet Jews joined the protesters
living in tents in Jerusalem, saying they would soon become
homeless as well.
   A violent incident involving Soviet Jews was reported Wednesday
in Nazareth Ilit, or Upper Nazareth, the Jewish suburb of the
biblical Nazareth in northern Israel.
   Israel radio said the state-run Amidar housing company invted
Soviet immigrants to look at 250 renovated apartments available in
the city. Roughly 900 Soviets arrived from across the country, and
a scuffle between them soon developed into a ``full-scale riot'' as
a result of which four immigrants were hospitalized, the radio
reported.

<TEXT>
   Security forces nearly captured Pablo
Escobar, reputed leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel, but the
billionaire fugitive escaped into the jungle, police said Wednesday.
   During a widespread drug raid Tuesday in northeastern Colombia,
police closed in on Escobar, Colombia's most wanted man, a national
police spokesman told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance with police
policy.
   Police said that during the raid they arrested 11 employees of
the Medellin drug cartel, all of whom are reportedly close
associates of Escobar.
   But the drug lord, aided by about 15 bodyguards, fled into the
jungle near Puerto Triunfo, about 75 miles east of Bogota, the
police spokesman said.
   A police spokeswoman blamed a television station for blowing the
cover on the supposedly confidential raid.
   Attempting to explain how Escobar had eluded capture once again,
she said Colombia's TV Hoy had disclosed the raid.
   ``This has hurt us. It has taken the element of surprise from
the operation,'' she said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The raid was the latest attack in the government's 11-month-old
war on drug traffickers. It began last August when traffickers were
blamed for the assassination of leading presidential hopeful Luis
Carlos Galan.
   Since then, the traffickers have retaliated with a terror
campaign of car bombings, massacres and police assassinations, and
hundreds of people have been killed.
   About 600 army troops and policemen participated in the raid, a
presidential press spokesman told The AP. He also spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Some of the officers who directed the operation were trained by
the British and Canadian armies, the police spokesman said.
   The police spokesman said the operation will continue
indefinitely, and the head of Colombia's national police, Miguel
Gomez Padilla, told reporters he still hoped to capture Escobar.
   ``We believe that he is still in the region. We are close to
him,'' Gomez said.
   Police said that among those arrested was Escobar's
brother-in-law, Hernan Quintero. The police spokesman said Quintero
supplied dynamite and weapons to be used in the cartel's bombing
and assassination campaigns.
   Also arrested was the man believed to be Escobar's personal
physician, Jose Cortes, the police spokesman said.
   The other suspects allegedly included Escobar's security chief
and a man believed to be in charge of transporting hired assassins
around Colombia, the Bogota daily newspaper El Tiempo said, quoting
police sources.
   Troops sweeped the region, using helicopters and radio
equipment, after a private citizen requesting anonymity tipped
authorities to Escobar's whereabouts, authorities said.
   The police spokesman said officers seized 7,700 pounds of
dynamite, assault rifles, revolvers, sophisticated communications
equipment and documents that could lead to Escobar's capture.
   At one point during the raid, security forces were able to
intercept Escobar's communications with his guards, the police
spokesman said.
   Escobar had escaped manhunts twice before in the last year.
   The last time was in central Colombia in November when he fled
into the jungle in his underwear after being encircled.
   The government has offered to pay $400,000 for information
leading to Escobar's capture, alive or dead.
   Authorities say his drug empire is based in Medellin, Colombia's
second-largest city with almost 3 million inhabitants. The city,
150 miles northwest of Bogota, has been plagued by drug violence.
   Gen. Harold Bedoya, Medellin's army commander, has accused
Escobar of the June 23 massacre of 19 people, many of them teen-age
students, at a Medellin bar. He said the attack was carried out in
retaliation for authorities killing the drug cartel's terrorist
operations chief, John Jairo Arias, in the city June 13.
   Authorities say drug traffickers have placed a bounty of $4,300
on the heads of all police officers in the city. More than 100 have
been killed this year.
   One of the cartel's leaders, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, was killed
in December on Colombia's northern coast.
   Since August, the administration of President Virgilio Barco has
extradited 15 drug suspects to face charges in the United States
and confiscated hundreds of properties belonging to the cocaine
barons.
   At one time, the Medellin cartel was believed responsible for
most of the cocaine that is smuggled into the United States.

<HEAD>Philly Mayor's Task Force on Homeless Resigns in Protest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL STIEG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A committee formed in 1983 to advise the
mayor on the homeless quit in protest Wednesday, saying Mayor W.
Wilson Goode ignored it while making drastic cuts in services.
   Some 80 members of the Mayor's Public-Private Task Force on
Homelessness resigned in a unanimous voice vote at a meeting two
days after its leadership recommended the action.
   After the vote, the city's managing director, David Pingree,
told the group that quitting en masse would leave the homeless
without a voice in City Hall.
   ``They are advocates for the homeless,'' Pingree said afterward.
``The task force provided them an internal mechanism in government
that very few groups had the opportunity to have.
   ``In order to preserve the purity of their advocacy, they were
throwing away a very pragmatic tool.''
   ``We're not losing anything _ we're gaining the ability to go
back to being advocates,'' said task force steering committee
co-chairwoman Chris Simiriglia.
   ``It sent them a message,'' said Chris Sprowal, founder of the
Committee for Dignity and Fairness for the Homeless and a member of
the task force's steering committee. ``It says the most
conservative homeless group in the city will not sit still while
you try to implement these terrible, terrible cuts.''
   Steering committee member Phyllis Ryan, director of the
Philadelphia Committee for the Homeless, a private organization,
estimated last year's budget cut money for the homeless in half, to
$17 million.
   The current budget cuts leave only about $10 million for
homeless services, she said.
   ``Nobody can use us again to say there is a rational process
going on here,'' Ryan said. ``That was destroyed today.''
   The task force _ made up of officials from city agencies,
directors of private efforts such as shelters and soup kitchens, as
well as homeless people _ had no real power, members said.
   ``This has been a con job for years,'' Sprowal said. ``They have
made people feel important by saying `You're a member of a task
force,' and they get letters from the mayor, saying `Come to a
meeting.'
   ``And they feel important, that they have some influence. When
in the end they found out they had no damn influence at all.''
   Pingree, managing director for four months, said he regretted
that the group quit. He said nobody from the group had come to him
during budget talks to argue their case.
   A statement from the steering committee said: ``Our protests
against the devastation of the cutbacks fell on deaf ears. It's now
impossible to remain in this group whose forum has no influence.''

<HEAD>Parliament Rejects Probe of Rabin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Wednesday rejected calls for a
probe of former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's handling of the
Palestinian uprising.
   The move came hours after a new poll was released indicating
Rabin has become Israel's most popular politician.
   The poll showed Rabin, the No. 2 man in the left-leaning Labor
Party, could defeat Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Housing
Minister Ariel Sharon, the leading figures in the right-wing Likud
bloc, if direct elections were held.
   However, the poll indicated both Shamir and Sharon could defeat
the Labor Party leader, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, if the
elections were held now. The poll was expected to strengthen
Rabin's hand in challenging Peres for party leadership.
   Voters currently select slates of candidates, but Parliament has
given preliminary approval to a bill for election reform for direct
balloting.
   The motion for a probe of Rabin's handling of the Palestinian
uprising was defeated by a vote of 65 to 16. Both right- and
left-wing legislators had accused Rabin of illegally ordering
soldiers to beat rioters in January 1988.
   The orders led to a number of deaths and serious injuries of
Palestinians. Rabin was defense minister until March 13, when he
resigned with other Labor ministers to protest Shamir's hesitancy
to accept American peace proposals. Shamir last month formed a
right-wing government that excluded Labor.
   In all, 723 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
and civilians since the uprising began in December 1987. An
additional 233 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs, most
for alleged collaboration with Israeli authorities. Forty-five
Israelis also have been killed by Arabs.
   One sponsor of the call for a probe accused Rabin of failing to
support army officers charged with illegally beating Palestinians
to death. He claimed troop morale was also at stake.
   ``You personally gave these orders, why shouldn't you stand
trial?'' said Michael Eitan of Shamir's Likud bloc. ``Soldiers from
now on will fear that all the orders they get will later be
disavowed.''
   Another sponsor, Yossi Sarid of the left-wing Citizens' Rights
Movement, said ``if the government found it necessary to establish
an investigation into Sabra and Chatilla, it should certainly do so
now.''
   He was refefering to the 1982 massacre in Beirut refugee camps
by Lebanese militiamen during Israel's occupation. An official
inquiry into the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees ended
in the resigation of Sharon as defense minister.
   Rabin defended his policies by saying that beatings were ordered
to limit the use of live ammunition, which were causing many
fatalities at the time.
   He insisted his instructions were clear that once a
demonstration was under control, beating should cease.
   Rabin said he told senior officers on Jan. 21, 1988, that ``the
aggressive response by our soldiers, including beatings, during
riots and against attacks on our forces, are necessary to prevent
the worst -- opening fire and causing death.''
   ``And I also said in the same discussion, `this, which means
beatings, is better than what went before, which means opening fire
with live ammunition, on condition it is done during demonstrations
and attacks and not afterwards.''
   The Israeli-born Rabin, 68, also a former prime minister, gained
popularity in Israel for his tough stance against the Palestinian
uprising.
   The poll indicating his most recent popularity was conducted
between June 24 and July 3 among 1,200 Jewish adults by independent
pollster Hanoch Smith. It had three percent margin of error. It was
published in The Jerusalem Post daily.
   It showed that in a direct election Rabin would gather 50
percent of the vote, to Shamir's 33 percent. The remainder were
undecided.
   Against Sharon, 54 percent would choose Rabin, 28 percent Sharon.
   Shamir, however, would out-poll Labor leader Peres 44 percent to
29 percent, and Sharon would beat him 37 percent to 34 percent.
   New elections are not scheduled until 1992.

   The Byelorussian legislature declared the republic
a ``national ecological disaster zone'' Wednesday because of the
Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster and ordered that supplies of cars
and tractors to other regions be cut, Tass said.
   The news agency said the supplies were being reduced because
contaminated vehicles must be taken out of service. It offered no
explanation. Tass said milk and meat supplies to other republics
were also being reduced.
   Byelorussia received much of the radioactivity from Chernobyl,
which is in the neighboring Ukraine, but its leaders have been slow
to order evacuations of residents and take cleanup measures.
   More than 2 million Byelorussians are living on contaminated
land four years after the accident, Tass said, and more than
119,000 of them must be moved.
   In Gomel, Byelorussia, workers at 20 factories struck for two
hours Wednesday to complain about government handling of the
Chernobyl cleanup.

   Disputing a report that ``Dick Tracy''

Co. said Wednesday that the film's video debut has not been set.
   The Wall Street Journal, citing industry sources, reported
Wednesday that ``Dick Tracy'' could arrive in video stores for the

   A spokeswoman for Disney's home video arm said that although the
company has discussed the video release of ``Dick Tracy'' with
retailers, no firm decision has been made.
   ``This is really in the discussion stage,'' said the
spokeswoman, Tania Steele, who said Disney also hasn't picked a

   ``Dick Tracy,'' starring Warren Beatty, Al Pacino and Madonna,
is playing in more than 2,200 theaters and has been one of the
box-office blockbusters of the summer season.

   An earthquake in northwestern
British Columbia jolted parts of the Yukon and Alaska on Wednesday,
the Pacific Geoscience Center reported. There were no reports of
damage or casualties.
   The quake measured 5.4 on the Richter scale and was centered in
the St. Elias Mountains about 35 miles west of Haines, Alaska. It
was felt at Whitehorse and Haines Junction in the Yukon and in
Alaska.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   A quake of 5.0 magnitude can cause considerable damage.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson on Wednesday called on
President Bush to hold a domestic summit to discuss social and
economic justice in the United States.
   Jackson made his call at the 81st annual convention of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People while
Bush wrapped up an economic summit with world leaders in Houston.
   ``If indeed Mr. Bush can have a summit meeting with world
leaders ... he can have a domestic summit with civil rights
leaders,'' Jackson said.
   ``We need and deserve a summit to discuss urban development and
a rural renaissance,'' he told several thousand NAACP delegates.
``We need a call for perestroika, for restructuring our economy,
for openness.''
   The federal government should offer developers of small
businesses and low-income housing the same kinds of long-term,
low-interest loans it gives other nations, and set aside the same
kind of money it is spending to bail out failed savings and loans,
said Jackson.
   ``Money must be found to bail out urban and rural America,'' he
said.
   Jackson said the difference between Bush's foreign and domestic
policies and those of former President Ronald Reagan was
``onionskin thin.''
   ``There has been a false perception that there has been a
fundamental change in the White House,'' he said. ``Both used
quotas as scare tactics. Bush cut the housing budget, Reagan cut
the housing budget. Neither supports the Equal Rights Amendment for
women.''
   Jackson also reiterated his support for statehood for
Washington, D.C., and his plans to run for ``shadow'' senator of
the district in November.
   ``We pay more taxes per capita than 49 states,'' Jackson said.
``Every other (national) capital in the Western world has
representation but us. We've been robbed of representation.''
   Jackson, who has made two unsuccessful bids for the presidency,
would not say if he would try again. ``I've not made that decision
yet,'' he said.
   Earlier, NAACP delegates ratified numerous resolutions,
including one that supports dropping the employer sanctions in the
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, under which employers
can be fined if they knowingly hire illegal immigrants.
   Those who proposed the resolution said dropping the sanctions
provision would decrease discrimination against immigrants. Others
voiced concern that immigrants take jobs from low-income black
teen-agers.
   NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks said delegates should
worry about creating jobs for all people who want and need them,
not whether one group is ``taking'' jobs from another.
   ``The real problem in America is creating more jobs,'' Hooks
said.

   President Bush defended his son Neil's integrity
anew on Wednesday and said he has had to calm down other Bush sons
who wanted to ``go to the barricades'' over public criticism of
Neil's role in a savings and loan controversy.
   Bush renewed his promise not to intervene in an investigation by
federal bank regulators of his 34-year-old son's role as a director
of a Denver S&amp;L that went bankrupt at a cost to taxpayers of $1
billion.
   ``This is not easy for me as a father. It's easy for me as a
president because the system's going to work,'' said Bush at a news
conference shortly after wrapping up the economic summit.
   In Washington, federal officials said they were considering a
negligence lawsuit against Neil Bush and other former directors of
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association.
   Bush was asked if he thought regulators were conducting a
vendetta against his son because of the relationship with the
president.
   ``I agree that the president ought to stay out of it and that
the system ought to work,'' he said. ``I have great confidence in
the integrity and honor of my son.''
   ``And if he's done something wrong, the system will digest
that,'' said Bush.
   Commenting on his family more generally, he said, ``It's tough
on people in public life to some degree.''
   ``I've got three other sons and they all want to go to the
barricades. Every one of them, when they see some cartoon they
don't like, particularly those that are factually incorrect and
total demeaning of the honor of their brother, they want to do what
any other kids would do,'' the president said.
   He said he has advised them: ``You calm down now. We're in a
different role now. You can't react like you would if your brother
was picked on in a street fight. That's not the way the system
works.''
   As he spoke, his wife Barbara sat listening in the front row.
   ``We have great emotions that I share with Barbara and I share
with my sons and my daughter that I won't share with you,'' Bush
said.
   Later, as the Bushes returned to Washington aboard Air Force
One, Mrs. Bush was asked her reaction.
   ``The president spoke for all the family today,'' she told

<HEAD>`Jersey City': A Play About Children with Trauma</HEAD>

   Off-Broadway's Second Stage, founded, like a
thrift shop, to give good products a second home, is increasingly
turning to the presentation of new plays.
   The latest effort is ``Jersey City,'' which opened Wednesday
night. Its protagonists are two adolescents, damaged by childhood
traumas, trying to become adults.
   The girl, Magaly, has been forced into incest by her father
since she was 5. The boy, David, had his father taken away and
found his brother's body after a shooting in the streets of San
Salvador.
   They run away and meet in Jersey City, N.J.
   The play, written by Wendy Hammond, moves with realism and
suspendse to a hope-filled ending. Ms. Hammond has had two previous
plays done outside New York.
   The story begins in Brooklyn, with Magaly's never-visible mother
working nights and father slapping and knocking her into
submission. Then he rapes her. Sex scenes are done with actors
clothed or partly clothed.
   Magaly and David are impossibly nice and well-adjusted,
considering what they've been through. This makes the play easier
for the audience to take.
   But their problems aren't glossed over. Esther, a bar dancer who
sends Magaly home with David to escape her father's pursuit, also
is impossibly nice. But her problems as a mother of two children
with different fathers are real.
   Megaly and David fall in love, but she remains troubled by her
past. She has nightmares. And she can't make love without being hit.
   She eventually finds free counseling.
   The playwright has simplified their problems, focusing on the
psychological harm wrought by child abuse and shock.
   The acting was first-rate, by two ``Sesame Street'' veterans,
Alison Bartlett as Magaly and Eddie Castrodad as David, Jude
Ciccolella as Pa and Adina Porter as Esther.
   The director was Risa Bramon, a member of the Ensemble Studio
Theater.

   The Bush administratation says the most useful
thing it can do now for the Soviet Union, rather than send cold,
hard cash, is to give it a few lessons in good old American
know-how.
   Sending experts abroad to help needy countries, known as
``technical assistance'' in foreign-policy jargon, has been a
centerpiece of the U.S. foreign aid program for years. And now it
is a feature of the new spirit of cooperation between the
superpowers.
   Some allies, including West Germany and France, hoped the United
States and other industrial democracies would go much further _ and
agree at the economic summit in Houston to fashion a coordinated
package of direct assistance to the reeling Soviet economy.
   President Bush, among others, resisted. The dispute was blunted,
for the time being, when the seven summit partners agreed instead
Tuesday to organize a quick study of the Soviet Union's needs.

   The region's leaders have called on
the world to help President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, whose
10-week-old government is struggling to end a crippling
Sandinista-led strike and street skirmishes.
   Sporadic gun battles between government backers and opponents
continued on Tuesday. At least four people have been killed and 84
injured in unrest that began after tens of thousands of government
workers went on strike 11 days ago.
   The Sandinistas oppose layoffs of civil servants ordered by the
U.S.-backed government, which is trying to cut the budget deficit
and nurse back to health an economy ravaged by a decade of war and
U.S. trade sanctions.
   Opposition is also strong in the country of 3.7 million people
to government plans to sell many of the properties the Sandinistas
confiscated and nationalized after coming to power in a 1979
popular revolution.

   AIDS is rapidly rising through the ranks of
killers of American women of childbearing age and by next year will
probably be the fifth leading cause of death among them, scientists
reported today.
   The AIDS death rate is dramatically higher among young black
women than whites, and the disease is far more prevalent in the
Northeast than in other regions, the scientists said in the Journal
of the American Medical Association.
   AIDS already claims more black women ages 15 to 44 in New York
state and New Jersey than any other health problem, wrote the
researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   ``We've known how serious the problem is in New Jersey,''
Christine Grand, deputy state health commissioner, said by
telephone Tuesday from Trenton. ``However, even those working in
the field are shocked to see how high the standing is vis-a-vis all
causes of death.''

   Tens of thousands of coal miners
challenged Communist leaders today with a 24-hour strike, giving
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev a fresh headache just a day after
his re-election as party chief.
   The walkout falls on the anniversary of a protracted strike last
summer that brought the coal industry to a standstill and crippled
factories.
   It was the worst Soviet labor unrest in 72 years and ended only
after the government promised improved living conditions and
market-oriented reforms.
   The miners say authorities have failed to keep their promises,
and say they'll form an independent union next month. Gorbachev
would be the first Soviet leader since Vladimir Lenin to face such
a union.

<HEAD>New Book Stirs Old Argument About Deaths on the Matterhorn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new book has revived the 125-year-old dispute
about whether four members of the first party to climb the
Matterhorn died by accident or design.
   Rumors and suspicions have lingered since the rope connecting
them to the three other climbers broke on the Matterhorn's north
face less than two hours after the team conquered the 14,700-foot
peak on July 14, 1865.
   They fell 4,000 feet to their deaths.
   The victims were French guide Michel Croz and three Englishmen:
the Rev. Charles Hudson, 36; Douglas Hadow, 19, and Lord Francis
Douglas, 20, whose body was never found. The survivors were British
writer-artist Edward Whymper, who initiated the expedition; a local
guide, Peter Taugwalder, and the guide's son.
   An investigation found no evidence of foul play, but police kept
the result secret and it became known only 55 years later, through
an article published in Britain's Alpine Journal.
   Early rumors, first mentioned in a Vienna newspaper, alleged
that Whymper cut the rope to enhance his own fame. He said in a
letter to The Times of London in August 1865 that none of the three
survivors could be blamed for the deaths, but did not refer to the
rumors.
   Six years later, a graphic account of the climb in Whymper's
``Scrambles Amongst The Alps'' added fuel to the controversy. It
said suggestions that the Swiss guide, Taugwalder, cut the rope
were ``infamous.'' Whymper said such rumors persisted in the
guide's native Zermatt, at the foot of the Matterhorn.
   Whymper's book also referred, however, to ``grave suspicion''
falling on the Swiss guide because the rope between Taugwalder and
the nearest of the four others, Lord Douglas, ``was the thinnest
and the weakest one we had.''
   This was ``suspicious because it is unlikely that the four men
in front would have selected an old and weak rope when there was
abundance of new, and much stronger rope to spare,'' Whymper wrote.
   If Taugwalder ``thought that an accident was likely to happen,
it was to his interest to have the weaker rope where it was
placed,'' he said, implying this would protect Taugwalder from
being dragged along.
   More than a century later, that comment by Whymper caused Swiss
writer Hannes Taugwalder, a distant relation of the guide, to begin
two decades of research. The result, ``Closer to the Truth,'' was
published just before the 125th anniversary.
   Taugwalder portrays Whymper as an ``ice-cold,'' fiercely
ambitious man whose education and intelligence easily allowed him
to dominate the two Swiss survivors.
   ``Of course, there were others in Zermatt who envied Peter
Taugwalder, but the rumors about him started only after Whymper's
book came out,'' the writer said in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press.
   His book contends the guide had to use the weak rope because
Whymper cut the better one shortly before reaching the summit so he
could race up the last few yards.
   Whymper's account does not mention any cutting, but says he and
the French guide, Croz, ``dashing away, ran a neck-and-neck race,
which ended in a dead heat.''
   Citing the works of Sir Arnold Lunn, the late British author of
mountaineering and skiing books, Taugwalder wrote that Whymper once
told a dinner companion he vaguely remembered cutting the rope to
free him for the race with Croz.
   ``There were two strong Manila hemp ropes, each 30 meters
long,'' the book says. ``One linked the first four descending, The
other, being cut, was not long enough to tie it to the last of the
four.''
   ``And Whymper insinuated that Taugwalder, who had actually no
alternative, chose the weak rope because it would have saved his
life in case of an accident,'' he said. ``This was malevolent
slander.''
   Hannes Taugwalder, who has scaled the Matterhorn twice, concedes
the full story may never be known. ``That's why I titled the book
`Closer to the Truth','' he said.

   Disregarding Iran's antagonism toward America,
U.S. church agencies have sent money and supplies to help the
thousands of victims of the devastating June 21 earthquake in the

   Church World Service, relief arm of the National Council of
Churches, last week airlifted 5,606 pounds of antibiotics, blood
bags and disinfectants valued at $286,557, assembled in cooperation
with Interchurch Medical Assistance.
   CWS also has raised $50,000 from member denominations as part of
a $150,000 appeal to meet needs for food, tents and sanitation
equipment in Iran, where an estimated 40,000 were killed, 60,000
injured and half a million left homeless.
   ``We are not looking at the political behavior of the Iranian
government, but at the needs of the Iranian people,'' said the Rev.
Dale Bishop of the NCC's Middle East office.
   Feed the Children of Larry Jones International Ministries in
Oklahoma City shipped 40 tons of medical supplies, food and
clothings. Catholic Relief Services gathered donations for victims,
and Lutheran World Relief sent 21,591 pounds of quilts and clothing
valued at $35,567 as an initial response, while United Methodism's
disaster relief agency sent an initial emergency grant of $10,000.
   U.S. churches are working with the Middle East Council of

<HEAD>Fundamentalists Vow To Force Mormon Branch Back To Roots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERN ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDEPENDENCE, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of dissenters, Richard Price,
sees no end to the turmoil afflicting the Reorganized Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, unless its assertedly
``liberal'' leadership resigns or does a doctrinal about-face.
   ``We don't know exactly how we will get the church back, but we
intend to do it,'' says Price, one of thousands of former or
dissenting members, called fundamentalists, who want the church to
return to its 19th century roots.
   Just as firmly, the faith's president says that while discontent
among a small minority is regrettable, their departure from the
main body has unified those who remain.
   ``I hate to say that it helps us, because it certainly does
not,'' said Wallace B. Smith, RLDS president. ``At the same time I
would have to say that to the extent there is less contention, less
day-to-day bickering ... it could be advantageous.''
   Many of the issues dividing about 150 dissenting congregations,
called Restoration Branches, from the American-born church's
mainstream of about 1,100 congregations have brewed for decades.
But discontent rose sharply after Smith in 1984 announced a
revelation encouraging priesthood ordination for women.
   ``That was just the last strw because it was a very tangible
issue,'' said William Russell, a professor at church-operated
Graceland College in Limoni, Iowa, who is writing a book about the
split.
   The 243,000-member RLDS shares a common 1830 origin with the 4
million-member Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
(Mormons). Its members followed leader Brigham Young to Utah after
the death in Illinois of church founder Joseph Smith Jr. in 1844.
   The RLDS Church was organized in 1860 by followers of Smith in
the Midwest with his son, Joseph Smith III, as its prophet. Its
canon of scripture includes the Bible, the Book of Mormon and the
Doctrine and Covenants, but its theology differs substantially from
the larger body.
   Sharp differences over the future of the RLDS church and
interpretation of its past, including the historicity of the Book
of Mormon and its author's visionary claims, have fractured many
RLDS congregations and families.
   Fundamentalists say the hierarchy has de-emphasized the Book of
Mormon and ignored Joseph Smith's divine mandate to restore the
true gospel to a Christian world fallen into apostasy since New
Testament times.
   Moderates counter that the church must change to meet new
conditions.
   ``The conservatives seem to me just to kind of want to freeze
the church at a point they feel represents kind of an ideal ...
doctrinal position,'' Wallace B. Smith said. However, he said the
church holds that through divine inspiration, ``gospel principles
can be subject to further interpretation in order to meet the needs
of a changing society.''
   Since 1984, the conservative movement has grown to about 20,000,
a majority in the Independence-Kansas City area, according to a
Price survey. Russell believes the figure is accurate and that
fundamentalists make up about 15 percent of regularly attending
RLDS membership.
   Through his Independence publishing company, Price has printed
dozens of books, pamphlets and a 7,000-circulation magazine aimed
at showing, point by point, that the church is being led toward
mainstream Protestantism by leaders who ignore or distort the
faith's founding beliefs.
   ``It took 30 years for the hierarchy to inject this humanistic
theology in the church, and we're prepared to wait even longer if
necessary to take it back,'' said Price, who was expelled from the
church in 1987, in part for his practice of running full-page
newspaper ads challenging RLDS leaders.
   Smith and other church leaders dispute the size of the
insurrection but have acted decisively to quell it, seizing chapels
of dissident congregations and officially silencing rebellious
elements of the lay ministry. In 1988-89 alone, 1,242 men were
silenced or released from the priesthood.
   ``We have particularly expected our priesthood members to be
supportive of our actions and not use the pulpit to oppose them,''
said Smith, 60, RLDS president since 1978.
   Most observers of the conflict say it originated with the advent
in 1958 of President W. Wallace Smith, the current president's late
father, and his associates who led a re-evaluation of mission as
the church expanded abroad.
   ``There was much less emphasis on Joseph Smith and the Book of
Mormon; more on the Bible and general Christian thinking,'' Russell
said.
   Smith said the church will continue to emphasize evangelism and
``spend ourselves in the pursuit of peace and justice.''
   He said the church views the Book of Mormon as scripture which
speaks truth about God, but that determining its ``exact
historicity ... simply will have to await that time when there are
some archaeological proofs or evidences.''
   The book, which Joseph Smith claimed to have translated from
gold plates given him by an angel, purports to be a history of
peoples from the Middle East who came to the Americas and were
visited by a resurrected Christ.

   Seeking an objective opinion of where financial
markets are headed, Fidelity Investments, one of the world's
biggest buyers and sellers of securities, has gone to the source:
It's asking investors.
   While that step might not seem revolutionary, it is decidedly
the opposite of how the marketplace usually functions. More often
than not, most popularly circulated opinions originate with brokers
rather than investors.
   Wall Streeters are prolific advisers, dispensing a flood of
opinions every minute, hour and day about almost any subject known
or unknown to them, the primary purpose of which is to keep the
market active and remunerative.
   Whether it accomplishes the latter is a moot point since the
proliferation of opinion comes at a great cost in credibility.
   In contrast, there is probably no opinion more solid than that
of buyers or potential buyers, whose views are based on their own
financial condition, expectations and ability to buy or sell.
   It is into this mine of data that Fidelity is delving to create
its Survey of Individual Investors, a statistical measurement of
investor sentiments and expectations, including intentions three
months into the future.
   Good news or poor, Fidelity will have to live with results of
the survey because it is being conducted and controlled by the
University of Michigan's Survey Research Center, already noted for
surveys of consumer sentiment.
   Sindlinger &amp; Co., a Wallingford, Pa., marketing and research
firm, already produces similar surveys for clients, but this is the
first time a worldwide marketer of securities, which Fidelity is,
has entered the field.
   The rationale for doing so is that sound surveys of consumer
sentiment and expectations already have demonstrated that a
relationship exists between consumer expectations and actual
changes that later occur in the economy.
   That relationship has been demonstrated, for example, in the
areas of interest rates, unemployment levels, inflation rates,
gross national product, homebuying and vehicle purchases. Why not
securities, too?
   Fidelity's questions were added to the Michigan survey in
January, so as yet there is little historical record with which to
make comparisons. But in those few months of existence some
significant findings have emerged.
   Michael Hines, Fidelity vice president for marketing, points
out, for example, that June's investor expectations were
encouraging, since investor households measured significantly
higher than households in general.
   Another important finding was that after four straight months of
expecting interest rates to rise, investors in June said they
anticipated a decline over the next 12 months.
   The survey also found:
   _Established investors continue to view prospects for their own
financial situation in favorable terms.
   _Among various types of mutual funds, owners of money market
funds are most likely to plan additional investments in the next
three months.
   _Owners of individual stocks in May seemed to be more content
with their position than in April. Fewer were likely to make
additional investments, and fewer were likely to sell.
   These are among the first findings released by Fidelity.
Hereafter, said Hines, detailed results will be issued on a regular
monthly basis, within a week of each survey's completion.

   As they map out strategies for managing their
personal finances in the 1990s, many Americans seem to have agreed
on a common precept: Put a little less faith in credit.
   They haven't sworn off borrowing by any means. As of May they
carried no less than $725 billion in credit card balances, auto
loans and other types of consumer debt.
   But the growth of borrowing and lending activity, which
sometimes proceeded at a dizzying pace in the 1980s, has shown
distinct signs of slowing.
   While that threatens to worsen the various woes of the economy
in the near future, many economists say it could well prove over
the longer term to be a sensible and beneficial development for all
concerned.
   The cutback on credit often is seen as the result of, and a
necessary response to, the borrowing spree of the past decade.
   Most analysts agree that is a primary force behind the trend,
but see several other important influences as well.
   ``A fundamental shift in attitude towards leverage has occurred
in the U.S. economy and is being reinforced by government policy,''
says Richard Hoey, chief economist in the United States for the
international investment firm of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Inc.
   ``There is both a reduced willingness to demand credit and a
reduced willingness to supply credit.''
   The government has played a part on both sides of the equation.
Pressure from bank regulators has helped push many lending
institutions toward extracautious standards in deciding who
qualifies for a loan.
   At the same time, tax changes put into effect over the past
several years seem to be crimping consumers' demand for loans.
   Just a decade ago, Uncle Sam permitted tax deductions that
subsidized borrowing to the tune of as much as 50 cents for each $1
in interest that consumers paid. Now that deduction is worth 3.3
cents per dollar of interest, at most, and it disappears altogether
next Jan. 1.
   If tax changes make borrowing these days seem more expensive, so
does the relatively high level of interest rates in comparison to
the inflation rate.
   While inflation runs at an annual pace of 4 percent to 5
percent, a car buyer might pay an average of 12.29 percent on a
four-year, $9,000 auto loan, according to the Bank Rate Monitor.
   Personal loans and credit card borrowing typically run in the 17
percent to 19 percent range, or higher in some cases.
   Gone is the incentive that existed in the late 1970s and early
1980s to borrow freely, paying interest costs of nearly nothing
once inflation was taken into account.
   Furthermore, with the flattening out of the boom in the housing
market, the use of debt as speculative leverage in real estate has
lost a lot of its appeal.
   Observers like Hoey also say an absence of heady gains in home
prices has dampened enthusiasm for types of credit other than
mortgages and construction loans.
   ``We believe that real estate values and the perception of real
estate liquidity are crucial to consumer confidence,'' he says.
``Even in the absence of a major change in real estate prices, the
perceived, or psychic, liquidity of real estate fluctuates.
   ``Middle-class balance sheets become less liquid when real
estate turnover drops, putting downward pressure on the willingness
to spend among consumers.''

<HEAD>Robertson, Falwell Take Diverging Paths After Organizing Religious
Right</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Television broadcasters Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell both
retreated from national politics and began tending to their own
spiritual gardens after sowing the seeds that brought forth the
political movement of the religious right.
   But their paths now seem to be diverging.
   Both of their TV ministries have rebounded from drops in
viewership and donations in the 1980s and the Christian
universities they founded in Virginia are expanding with record
enrollments.
   Falwell's Moral Majority political action organization, which
grew to 6.5 million members, disbanded in 1989. Robertson's Freedom
Council also faded away after his unsuccessful bid for president in
1988.
   Now, Robertson, the Pentecostal son of a U.S. senator and
distant relative of two presidents, is trying to remobilize his
political troops. Falwell, the fundamentalist grandson of a
bootlegger and son of a successful businessman, is resolved to stay
out of politics.
   Jeffrey Hadden, a University of Virginia sociologist and expert
on the Christian right, said there is more than a difference in
religion to explain the diverging paths.
   Robertson has politics in his blood, Hadden said. After his
exposure in the 1988 presidential campaign, ``It's hard for him to
walk away and say, `I'm not interested,''' Hadden said. ``Jerry did
it, but Jerry is less of a political animal.''
   Falwell is spending most of his time in Lynchburg running
Liberty University and said he believes the way to change a culture
is by educating the youth.
   ``I felt I did what I had to do, that is organize the religious
right,'' Falwell, 56, said during an interview on campus. ``I never
had any intentions of staying out there in the political arena.''
   Robertson, meantime, is once again trying to enlist the aid of
conservative Christians who backed his failed Republican
presidential bid in 1988.
   The Christian Coalition was formed by Robertson this summer to
help Christian candidates get elected to local and state offices
and Congress, director Ralph Reed Jr. said.
   In addition, the coalition ran a full-page advertisement in the
Washington Post on June 20, signed by Robertson, that warned
members of Congress against financing the National Endowment for
the Arts without restrictions on what he considers pornographic art.
   Robertson said he has no plans to make personal use of the
organization, which hopes to more than triple its membership of
30,000 before year's end.
   During an interview at his sprawling Christian Broadcasting
Network in Virginia Beach, Robertson laughed when asked what it
would take to get him to run for elected office.
   ``I think an angel coming down and standing in front of me, and
then three or four other signs. It would not be something I would
do lightly. It's too big an ordeal and the price is too great,'' he
said.
   ``For a politician to run for president, all they do is go back
to being senator or governor or what have you. For me, the cost was
over $150 million, and that's just too great a price to pay,'' he
said.
   Hadden said he believes Robertson will find it too hard to
resist entering the 1996 presidential race if there is no heir
apparent to George Bush and said the Christian Coalition may be
``greasing the skids.''
   Roberston's organization is an attempt to fill the gap in
leadership among conservative Christians, Hadden said.
``Conceivably, it could work. But we'll have to wait and see.''
   Robertson wrote in a Christian Coalition newsletter mailed to
250,000 homes that ``we want the activists mobilized in 1988 to
stay involved in the political process, not for a single campaign,
but for the long haul.''
   Robertson said in an interview that his primary campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination was ``a valuable learning
experience.''
   ``I'm beginning to see enormous benefits from the campaign that
I didn't see at the end of 1988,'' he said.
   Those benefits include what Robertson calls thousands of
political activists who supported his campaign. Those activists
gained experience and are now taking local and state leadership
positions within the party, he said.
   Besides a cadre of battle-seasoned political activists,
Robertson said, he has a list of 1.8 million families who expressed
an interest in his politics. ``Plus there's a very substantial list
of contributors to the campaign. Those together make a very nice
base for another organization.''
   Christian conservatives make up about 20 percent of the
electorate, said A. James Reichley, an expert on the impact of
religion in history and a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution in Washington.
   ``Falwell and Robertson played a significant role in persuading
them to become involved in politics,'' Reichley said. ``They have
both drawn back somewhat, as religious groups in general have in
the last couple of years.''
   Robertson's loss in 1988, he said, ``gave the whole movement
somewhat of a setback.''

<HEAD>Wrongful Convictions Leave Questions About Dallas Justice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five times in little more than a year, Dallas
County has freed prisoners who were unjustly convicted, earning it
a reputation as a modern-day practitioner of the Old West necktie
party.
   Does Dallas hang first, and ask questions later?
   Randall Dale Adams, Martin Kimsey, Joyce Ann Brown, Michael
Anthony Woten and Stephen Lynn Russell would agree; they spent a
total of 44 years in prison before courts or the governor decided
they never should have been sent there.
   But prosecutors say the county is getting a bum rap, and many
defense lawyers say Dallas differs from other justice systems only
in the celebrity of its wrongfully convicted prisoners.
   Foremost among them is Adams, 41, released last year after more
than 12 years in prison. Adams' conviction in the shooting of a
Dallas police officer was overturned after a key witness recanted
his testimony and the courts found a prosecutor had withheld
evidence.
   His story was recounted in the film ``The Thin Blue Line,'' and
Adams, who once was just days away from execution, now tours the
lecture circuit.
   His attorney, Randy Schaffer of Houston, says an Adams case
could happen anywhere. ``I suspect it is something that extends
across the country,'' he said. ``I don't think it's limited to
Dallas County.''
   But it has happened with unnerving regularity in Dallas:
   _ Kimsey, 49, was freed Feb. 9 after spending five years in
prison on a 1985 armored-car robbery conviction. A federal prisoner
since has confessed to the crime. Kimsey, rearrested after being
found with marijuana and alcohol, was pardoned by the governor May
21 and released two days later.
   _ Brown, 42, who spent nine years in prison for the armed
robbery of a Dallas fur store, learned in February she would not be
retried. An appeals court overturned her 1980 conviction, ruling
prosecutors should have told the defense a key witness had been
convicted of lying to police.
   _ Woten, 36, was pardoned in February after serving almost eight
years for an April 1982 grocery-store robbery; another man has
admitted the crime.
   _ Russell, 37, was pardoned in April after serving 10 years.
Another man confessed to the 1980 holdup of a Garland fast-food
restaurant.
   Another case of Dallas justice gone wrong was that of Lenell
Geter, an aerospace engineer who served 16 months in prison for the
1982 armed robbery of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. The case
drew national attention when it was examined on ``60 Minutes.''
   ``If you go into any other state ... you'll find the same thing
is going on there,'' said Tom Krampitz, executive director of the
Texas District and County Attorneys Association in Austin.
   Others _ among them, John Boston, executive director of the
Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association in Austin, and Ronald
Huff, director of the Criminal Justice Research Center at Ohio
State University _ say Dallas County seems to convict an unusual
number of innocent people.
   ``Certainly in terms of known cases ... Dallas County has had
more than one would expect,'' said Huff, author of the upcoming
book ``Convicted but Innocent: Wrongful Conviction and Public
Policy.''
   Neither side has data to back up its perceptions. Legal experts
say no one tracks wrongful conviction rates, except in death
penalty cases. But even those who defend Dallas justice say it has
characteristics not common elsewhere.
   Huff advocates re-investigating many cases that date to the days
of Henry Wade, the cigar-chomping prosecutor who ruled the Dallas
County district attorney's office for 36 years before retiring in
1987.
   Wade pegged his employees' promotions to the number of people
they put behind bars and the length of their sentences.
   Dallas still has a national reputation for promoting prosecutors
on the basis of their conviction rate, said Scott Wallace,
legislative director of the National Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers in Alexandria, Va.
   ``It's a system that tends to promote the numbers of convictions
over fairness and due process. To my knowledge, that is quite
unusual,'' he said.
   The emphasis has changed since John Vance succeeded Wade in the
district attorney's office, said Vance's first assistant, Norm
Kinne.
   Conviction rates, he said, are ``not as important a factor in
our determination if someone is ready to be promoted. It's just
something that is taken with all the rest of his or her
statistics.''
   The critics cite other reasons for wrongful convictions. High on
the list is ``trial by ambush,'' as defense attorneys have tagged
prosecutors' practice of springing new evidence at a trial.
   ``I think the mentality at the forefront in Dallas is, `Let's
hide everything we can ... let's play it like a game,' '' said
Schaffer, who got Adams' conviction overturned partly because of
withheld evidence.
   Kinne maintains the argument should be the other way around.
   Unlike many states where both sides of a legal case are required
to disclose evidence to the other, Texas criminal law is one-sided:
prosecutors are required to share certain information with the
defense, but defense attorneys are under no obligation to
reciprocate.
   ``I find it strange that they can say `trial by ambush' when
they give us nothing in the way of discovery and we give them a
whole lot. How is that an ambush? Who's ambushing who?'' Kinne
asked.
   Critics also cite a lack of funds for public defenders. Texas'
system of public defense offices representing the indigent is less
developed than most other states, said Mardi Crawford, a staff
attorney with the National Legal Aid and Defender Association in
Washington.
   In 1986, Texas ranked 39th in public-defense spending, Ms.
Crawford said, citing a Bureau of Justice report of the latest
figures available.
   Texas spends an average of $154 per inmate on public defense,
she said. New Jersey spent the most _ $540 per inmate _ and
Arkansas the least, $63.
   Krampitz of the District and County Attorneys Association said
all law enforcement authorities need better training and higher
pay. And that applies to prosecutors and judges, along with defense
attorneys, he said: ``You pay peanuts, you get monkeys.''
   Even those who fault Dallas' justice system say no one should
place blame solely on prosecutors.
   ``There's a whole lot of other folks that have been involved in
this process,'' Krampitz said. Each wrongful conviction was decided
by a jury, and each convict had a lawyer.
   ``Anybody that says the system is perfect is nuts,'' said
Schaffer.
   ``Juries bring to the courtroom whatever biases they hold
outside the courtroom,'' he said. ``Not every defendant is guilty,
not every police officer tells the truth, not every eyewitness is
perfect. The problem is, in individual cases, everybody forgets all
that.''

<HEAD>Romanian Police Crack Down on Black Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GABRIEL PASLARU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While Prime Minister Petre Roman
pledges to move toward a free economy, Bucharest police are
cracking down on the bustling black market.
   In a few days last month, they arrested 1,680 black market
operators and confiscated goods worth $270,000, a police statement
reported. It also said the illegal trade would be ``eradicated,''
but success has been elusive.
   The black market is the only source for many items. The goods
often are stolen from factories or stores, sometimes with the aid
of bribed workers.
   Fighting the trade and the corruption it feeds is made more
difficult by tolerance of the underground market by a public long
accustomed to facing shortages in stores and seeking ways around
them.
   After more than four decades of a planned economy and shortages
of virtually everything, Romanians are uncertain of how to approach
a free market.
   Officials speak proudly of more liberal rules on private
initiative promulgated since Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu
was deposed and executed in December, but say theft and
profiteering have accompanied freedom.
   Vasile Sebe, president of the Free Trade Union in Commerce, was
quoted by the daily Romania Libera as saying: ``Free initiative
must not turn into speculation with products which are scarce ...
but should stimulate entrepreneurs to find new sources of
supplies.''
   Production businesses have been slow to emerge because private
enterprises are limited to 20 employees and the bureaucracy remains
cumbersome. Thievery and the black market have flourished.
   Police reported the theft of coffee worth $50,000 in June and
said only one-fifth of it was recovered.
   State television said eight men were arrested in the act of
stealing boots from the Dimbovita footwear factory in Bucharest for
sale on the black market.
   The ease of travel in and out of this once tightly guarded
country has added an international dimension to the illicit trade.
   In Brasov, 125 miles north of Bucharest, three workers at a
manufacturing plant stole spare parts worth more than $7,500 and
sold them to a Yugoslav for a combination of Romanian currency,
German marks and foreign goods.
   At a factory in Botosani, in northeastern Romania, the sales
manager ordered 872 men's shirts worth $4,600 from the warehouse,
sold them to people planning trips to Poland and kept the money,
officials reported.
   Authorities hope a customs law that took effect this month will
help impede the black market by limiting the amount of goods
visitors can take in or out of the country without submitting to
the foreign trade law.
   Despite the crackdown, everything from bubble gum to Mercedes
cars continues to be sold in Bucharest's illegal street markets.
   During the June raids, police arrested several gypsies who were
selling cold beer in the street for more than five times the
official price.
   A bottle of wine may be worth $1 officially in a country where
average monthly pay equals about $125, but the state shops don't
have any because profiteers pay $1.75 a bottle under the counter
and sell it for $2.50.
   Grigore Untulescu, who sells soft drinks at quadruple the
official price, said someone else would do it if he didn't, ``and
besides, they can't arrest us all.''

   Here is a chronology of important events in the Wall Street
insider trading scandal, leading up to the conviction Tuesday of
ex-speculator John A. Mulheren Jr. on conspiracy and stock
manipulation charges:
   _May 1986 _ Federal authorities arrest Dennis Levine, a managing
director of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and accuse him of making
$12.6 million in illegal profits on insider trading tips.
   _June 1986 _ Levine pleads guilty and begins implicating a
number of industry colleagues including Ivan F. Boesky, the
best-known stock speculator on Wall Street, for extensive insider
trading abuses and other frauds.
   _November 1986 _ Boesky settles insider trading charges with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, paying a then-record $100
million in fines and penalties. He begins providing extensive
evidence against some of the most successful names on Wall Street,
notably junk-bond investment giant Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
its chief financier Michael Milken.
   _February 1987 _ Three leading Wall Street professionals,

   In an early version of an article July 10 on the
federal fraud trial of three commodities traders, The Associated
Press erroneously reported that the jury failed to reach a verdict
on more than 70 counts against Chicago Mercantile Exchange trader
Robert D. Mosky. The jury convicted Mosky of five fraud counts and
two counts of violating trading rules, acquitted him of 20 other
counts and failed to reach a verdict on 55 counts.

   A securities analyst fired after panning
Donald Trump's new casino is seeking $2 million in damages for
alleged defamatory comments by the developer that he was a ``bad
analyst'' and ``unguided missile.''
   Marvin B. Roffman, formerly a vice president with the
Philadelphia brokerage firm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., sued the
New York real estate and casino operator in U.S. District Court on
Tuesday.
   Roffman, 50, was fired March 23, three days after a negative
critique in The Wall Street Journal about Trump's new Taj Mahal
Casino Resort in Atlantic City, N.J.
   The case has attracted wide attention, not only because it
involves Trump but because it has raised questions about the
independence of securities analysts who comment frequently about
companies and business trends.
   Roffman told the Journal Trump's casino would flourish
immediately after it opened in April, but ``once the cold winds
blow from October to February, it won't make it. The market just
isn't there.''
   John Barry, a Trump spokesman, said he expects the lawsuit to be
dismissed. ``We will take the appropriate action to have the suit
dismissed as quickly as possible,'' he said.
   In a letter to Janney Montgomery President Norman T. Wilde after
Roffman's comments were published Trump said, ``For a long while I
have thought of Mr. Roffman as an unguided missile,'' according to
the suit.
   The lawsuit contends Trump's letter ``contained false and
defamatory material'' because Roffman's comments ``were not
outrageous; he is not an unguided missile, unprofessional ... and a
bad analyst.''
   Roffman's attorney, Martin Sobol, said his client believes he
lost his job because ``he was honest.'' Roffman, who is currently
unemployed, declined to comment.
   The lawsuit quotes publications that reported Trump's comments
about Roffman as evidence of defamation.
   In the April 2 edition of Barron's, Trump said of Roffman:
``He's a very unprofessional guy, a hair trigger.'' In the May 7
edition of Fortune, Trump is quoted as saying: ``They got rid of a
bad analyst, a man with little talent,'' the lawsuit said.
   Barry said Trump was free to express himself. ``If Mr. Roffman
thought the statements were defamatory, why isn't he suing the
publications in which they appear?'' Barry said.
   The lawsuit also claims Trump ``maliciously'' persuaded Janney
Montgomery to fire Roffman.
   ``Mr. Trump has no financial interest or control over Janney
Montgomery. To blame Mr. Trump for Janney Montgomery's action is
incomprehensible,'' Barry said.
   Trump threatened to sue Janney Montgomery unless Roffman
publicly retracted the comments or the firm fired the 16-year
veteran analyst. Roffman initially signed a letter of apology, but
withdrew it in a second letter and then was fired.
   Janney Montgomery contended Roffman was dismissed because he
violated company policy by issuing statements to the press that had
not been cleared or disseminated to the firm's clients.
   Wilde said in a statement that Roffman also disobeyed a
supervisor's orders by sending the second letter to Trump
retracting his apology.
   ``In dismissing Mr. Roffman, we took measures to uphold industry
standards concerning the professional integrity of security
analysts,'' the statement said.
   Janney Montgomery is a wholly owned subsidiary of Penn Mutual
Life Insurance Co. The firm has 1,050 employees and 40 offices.
   Roffman's comments about Trump made him a highly sought subject
for interviews, especially after recent disclosures that Trump
faced a cash crunch.
   Trump made a last-minute deal with bankers June 26 that allowed
him to meet the $43 million payment to holders of high-yield junk
bonds backing another casino, the Trump Castle.

   From the trading floors to the executive suites,
futures industry professionals breathed a little easier after the
government failed to prove a fraud racket operated at Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   ``The reaction here is a deep sigh of relief,'' said John
Damgard, president of the Washington-based Futures Industry
Association, a trade group for commodity futures brokerage firms.
   ``The verdicts shore up the contention that this was petty theft
compared with everything that's gone on in the savings and loan and
securities industries, and we can feel pretty good about
ourselves,'' Damgard said.
   Business was brisk Tuesday in the Merc's Swiss franc futures pit
_ one day after a federal jury convicted two franc traders of
relatively minor trading violations and acquitted a third.
   The jury could not reach verdicts on scores of more serious
charges, including a racketeering count against one defendant and
mail and wire fraud charges against all three.
   Federal prosecutors have said they plan to refile the remaining
charges against the men, whose sentencings are tentatively
scheduled for November.
   Two more commodity fraud trials resulting from an FBI sting
operation at the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade are scheduled
for September.
   Monday's conclusion of two months of U.S. District Court
proceedings felt ``like kissing your sister,'' said Anton Valukas,
the former U.S. attorney, now in private practice, who initiated
the 1988 undercover probe and announced the indictments last August.
   But Valukas said he was not disappointed in the verdicts.
   ``In terms of the overall investigation and prosecution, my
sense is that you await the outcome of all of the cases and then
you can sit back and talk about whether it was appropriate or not
appropriate,'' he said.
   Several defense lawyers preparing for the September trials said
they were heartened by the verdicts.
   ``It puts into serious question the government's basic claim
that what happened here is that customers were defrauded on a
wholesale basis,'' said James Streicker, attorney for indicted yen
futures trader Michael Smith.
   Defense lawyers said the government's failure to win a
conviction on the racketeering count would dissuade other traders
charged with racketeering from pleading guilty to reduced charges.
   Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's executive committee, noted
that the guilty verdicts on eight counts _ seven against floor
broker Robert D. Mosky and one against independent trader Danny
Scheck _ represented a total of $200 in funds lost to their
customers through trading irregularities.
   Melamed said the Merc did not condone any wrongdoing but added,
``It has to be put in perspective.''
   ``We clearly don't believe this is as major a federal crime as
some of these other things that are going on,'' he said, citing
scandals in the S&amp;L industry and the Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
   Sol Kaufman, an independent trader of currency futures at the
Merc, said news of the investigation and indictment's had tarnished
the Merc's image.
   ``I think to a certain degree this verdict will redeem that
reputation,'' he said.
   The jury found independent trader David Zatz innocent of two
counts of trading violations. The jury also acquitted Mosky of 20
counts of mail and wire fraud and couldn't reach a verdict on the
racketeering count against him.
   The panel returned verdicts on just 30 of the 116 counts in the
federal indictment.
   Each commodity fraud count conviction carries a maximum prison
sentence of five years and a $100,000 fine, prosecutors said.
   The two-month trial was the first to result from a sweeping
undercover FBI investigation of corruption at the Merc and the
larger Chicago Board of Trade, the world's two biggest futures
exchanges.
   In all, 48 people have been indicted since August. Sixteen have
pleaded guilty to reduced charges, including two Swiss franc
traders who testified against Mosky, Scheck and Zatz.
   Two other groups _ 13 soybean traders from the Board of Trade
and 15 Japanese yen traders from the Merc _ go on trial in
September.

   With the smack of a sake bottle, Japanese
shipbuilders on Wednesday christened the world's first ship that
will use superconductivity to push itself through the water.
   The high-tech ship, christened the Yamato No. 1, is an
experimental vessel shaped roughly like a streamlined telephone. It
is drydocked in the Kobe shipyard of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,
Japan's largest shipbuilder and a member of a consortium developing
the ship's new technology.
   The ship's developers said they view the vessel as a prototype
for highg-spped seacraft. It will use electromagnetic force instead
of a conventional screw propeller to thrust itself through the
water.
   The main purpose of the project, however, was to demonstrate
that superconductivity could be used to power a ship, they said.
   ``This ship has been developed without regard to cost. It's
experimental,'' said Jutaro Namba, a coordinator at Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries in Kobe, a major port in western Japan about 270
miles west of Tokyo.
   The 185-ton ship is 33 yards long and about 11 yards wide.
   Superconducting coils made of niobium and titanium in thrusters
underneath the ship are used to create a magnetic field that is
repulsed by an electric current carried in water circulating
through the thrusters. The repulsion produces the same kind of
force used to propel superconducting trains on land.
   Engineers who worked on the ship said a combination of helium
gas and liquid nitrogen is used to cool the coils to minus 452.47
degrgees Fahrenheit. At that temperature, electricity passes
through the coils without resistance.
   The use of water-propelled thrusters instead of conventional
rotating screw propellers is expected to minimize maintenance
problems as well as noise and vibration.
   The vessel also is energy-efficient. Most of the space on board
the ship is occupied, however, by diesel-engine generators used to
provide an electric current for the thrusters, for pumps and for
on-board equipment, the engineers said.
   The ship's main handicap at present is its speed, a mere 8
knots, compared with about 40 knots for fast hydroplanes. And to
minimize its weight, it has space for only about 10 people.
   Experts say new materials are needed to produce a strong enough
magnetic field to propel the ship at commercially viable speeds.
   Officials said that sea trials would be held in the spring of
1991, after the ship is fitted with thrusters and other seagoing
equipment. A smaller model of the ship first was successfully
tested in 1987.
   The vessel is the brainchild of a consortium of companies,
universities and government researchers led by the Japan Foundation
for Shipbuilding Advancement, with funding from the Ministry of
Transport.
   Superconductivity is expected to make the use of electricity
much more efficient, reducing the need for fossil fuels. It is
being developed for use in computers and their components, in
magnetically levitated high-speed trains, electric cars and other
devices.

<TEXT>
   The state's highest court has upheld investors'
ability to take some stockbroker disputes to independent
arbitration, dealing a blow to brokerage firms that have sought to
limit them to industry-run panels.
   The 6-0 ruling Tuesday by the New York state Court of Appeals in
Albany could affect thousands of investors nationwide who must sign
contracts with stockbrokers out how they must resolve disputes.
   ``It's really a victory for the consumer,'' said Theodore
Eppenstein, who represented investor Jeffrey Anderson in a case
against the brokerage Cowen &amp; Co. ``It gets us up to the level
playing field we're looking for.''
   Anderson in December 1988 sought to use a loophole in his
arbitration contract to have a dispute settled by the American
Arbitration Association rather than one of three industry-run
panels. Anderson claims he lost $250,000 through mishandling of his
accounts.
   Opponents claim the securities industry's abitration system is
stacked against the investor because the majority of arbitrators
have some industry affiliation. The industry denies any unfairness.
   Many investors have sought to bypass restrictions in contracts
via a clause in the American Stock Exchange's constitution that
permits customers to use the AAA unless the contract limits
arbitration to specific exchanges.
   The Cowen contract states arbitration must be settled ``in
accordance with the rules'' of the Amex, New York Stock Exchange or
National Association of Securities Dealers. The court interpreted
``rules'' to include the Amex constitution.
   ``Arbitration agreements are contracts and their meaning is to
be determined from the language employed by the parties under
accepted rules of contract law,'' the court said.
   The federal 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this year
closed the so-called ``Amex window'' in two cases, stating that the
contract language restricted arbitration the industry forums.
   Matthew Farley, an attorney for Cowen, said the ruling would not
resolve the issue of where customers can arbitrate their claims
because it was limited to the language of the Cowen contract.
   ``I take some comfort in the fact that the court did not choose
to issue a broad public pronouncement,'' Farley said. ``So I don't
think it has any universal application, that it's such a dire event
for the industry.''
   But Eppenstein said many brokerage contracts use the same
language as in Cowen's, and many states choose to follow New York
state law on securities issues.
   In a brief filed on behalf of Cowen, the Securities Industry
Association said ``many members have arbitration agreements
similar'' to Cowen's.
   The group said the ruling ``will affect the contracts of many of
our members and hundreds of thousands of their customers'' and have
``major implications for the securities industry.''
   A spokesman for the SIA could not be reached for comment. Amex
associate general counsel Scott Noah said he not read the decision
yet and could not comment.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering an Amex
proposal to clarify its constitution to give customers the right to
go to the AAA only if their contracts do not limit arbitration to
the industry forums.

   Budget bargaining between the Bush
administration and congressional leaders is resuming, with
participants hoping they can make a deal before Congress takes its
August recess.
   The negotiators held their first session Tuesday since June 29,
when Congress began a Fourth of July break. They spent most of
their time discussing possible changes in the budget process but
planned to return today to an exploration of possible spending cuts.
   The bargainers are trying to find at least $50 billion in new
taxes and spending reductions for fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1.
Lawmakers worry that with this year's congressional session cut
short for election campaigning, they need to work out a deal soon
to allow enough time to enact their package into law.
   ``If we don't make a deal before the recess, we're not likely to
make a quick deal after the recess,'' said a negotiator, Rep. Bill
Frenzel, R-Minn.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told Republican
senators, meantime, that a solid, multi-year deficit-cutting deal
would be a major boost in lowering interest rates, participants
said.
   Greenspan's luncheon comments cheered boosters of a budget pact,
who have long argued that such a package would benefit the economy
by producing lower interest rates.
   Meanwhile, the administration reiterated its support for a
balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, telling Congress it
would support such a measure when the full House votes on it next
Tuesday. House Democratic leaders oppose the proposal and expect to
defeat it.
   A requirement for a balanced budget would cut government
borrowing, which simply passes costs onto future generations in the
form of loans that must be repaid, said White House budget director
Richard Darman.
   ``Although the voters of the present are extremely
well-represented in our democratic system, the voters of the future
are not,'' Darman told the House Judiciary economic and commercial
law subcommittee.
   But subcommittee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, said such an
amendment would simply require what everyone wants _ a balanced
budget _ but not provide any help in achieving the difficult goal.
   ``Why don't we pass a constitutional amendment that simply
declares that we shall have clean air henceforth, we'll have a
drug-free society, and AIDS shall no longer be a menace to
society,'' Brooks said.

   Fox Broadcasting Co. is going after
pint-sized television viewers with the same vengeance it courts hip
adults.
   Doing battle with Disney Studios, the upstart network on Tuesday
announced its bold foray into children's programming.
   The Fox Children's Network will debut Sept. 8 and will include
5{ hours of animated and live-action shows, Margaret Loesch,
president of a new children's programming division, said during
Fox's annual summer presentation to critics.
   Among the programs Fox unveiled Tuesday was an animated series
featuring Peter Pan. Disney first featured the animated version and
produced the classic feature-length film.
   The Walt Disney Co. last February brought an antitrust lawsuit
against Fox, contending Fox threatened to drop some affiliate
stations to force them to carry its own afternoon children's
programming rather than Disney's.
   Citing figures that showed cartoon audiences, just like
prime-time viewers, are turning away from the big three networks _
CBS, NBC and ABC _ Fox executives said they hope to grab the
defectors.
   The Saturday morning package includes ``Tom and Jerry Kids,'' a
new Hanna-Barbera production of the cat-and-mouse series known to
millions of youngsters. This version takes place in Tom and Jerry's
adolescent years.
   Also on the kiddie slate: ``Bobby's World,'' an animated look
into the daydreams of a 4-year-old boy. The show was created by
comedian and actor Howie Mandel, who also provides Bobby's voice.
   There is also ``Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,'' based on the
cult feature film of the same name. John Astin recreates the voice
of Dr. Putrid T. Gangreen, the character he played on the big
screen.
   The executive producers of the hot prime-time cartoon ``The
Simpsons'' also addressed the critics' meeting. Cartoonist Matt
Groening, an executive producer of the show, said a movie was
possible ``if we could come up with a story idea that could sustain
a feature film.''
   Groening, whose ``Life in Hell'' comic strip is on greeting
cards and in newspapers, said he has considered penning a Simpsons
strip.
   Groening and his fellow Simpsons producers, Sam Simon and Oscar
and Emmy-winner James Brooks, said they were miffed to learn Fox
decided to move the show to Thursday night against NBC's top-rated
``The Cosby Show.''
   ``We're worried,'' Brooks said. ``It's formidable. I mean we're
going up against `The Cosby Show,' for God's sake.''

<HEAD>Contractors Meet To Discuss Getting Trump To Pay Them</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After weeks of debt negotiations with
bankers, Donald Trump now has to deal with about 150
subcontractors, who claim the developer owes them $70 million for
their work on his Taj Mahal Casino Resort.
   On Tuesday, the subcontractors elected a seven-person committee
to negotiate the alleged overdue payments in a three-hour meeting
that included Trump officials. The group refused to discuss the
talks.
   Before the meeting, Atlantic Plate Glass executive Marty
Rosenberg, whose company is owed $1.1 million, said Trump officials
had offered to resolve the dispute. But he said, ``I do not feel it
is a fair offer.''
   Trump offered to pay $20 million in cash to the contractors but
wanted to use non-interest-bearing notes to pay the remaining $50
million over the next five years, according to today's editions of
The Press of Atlantic City.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying Trump
offered an immediate payment of $5 million to a number of the
smaller creditors and $15 million to the remaining creditors in two
installments, one this month and one in August.
   Although some of the subcontractors had promised to discuss the
negotiations with the media, they clammed up midway through the
meeting shortly after Trump officials entered the discussions.
   Trump attorney Nicholas Ribis also refused to comment on
Tuesday's talks at Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino Hotel, which is
next door to the Taj Mahal on the Boardwalk.
   The dispute with the contractors follows reports that Trump is
suffering from a severe cash crunch caused by the enormous debt on
his casinos and real estate properties. He negotiated a deal with
banks last month that allowed him to meet a $43 million payment to
holders of high-yield junk bonds backing another casino, the Trump
Castle.
   The Taj Mahal, the city's largest casino, has averaged daily
gross gaming revenues of just under $1.2 million a day since its
April 2 opening. Analysts have said it needed about $1.3 million a
day to break even.
   Larger contractors are watching the progress of the negotiations
with the smaller contractors before deciding how to claim the $30
million they contend Trump owes them.
   ``It's something that has been going on for some time,'' said
attorney Noah Bronkesh, who represents Avalon Commercial Corp.,
which laid down tiles, marble and carpeting in the casino. Avalon
was not at the meeting Tuesday.
   ``People are getting restless,'' Bronkesh said. ``They're tired
of waiting. We're probably going to have some action by week's
end.''
   Trump has been sued three times in connection with construction
work on the Taj. One of the plaintiffs is Molded Fiber Glass of
Ashtabula, Ohio, which built the minarets and onion domes patterned
after the casino's namesake, a 17th century white marble mausoleum
in India.

<HEAD>IMF Chief Urges Rapid Moves In Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the International Monetary Fund on
Wednesday urged East European countries to move quickly toward
market economies.
   But Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said the financial
institution would not divert resources away from the Third World to
help the fledgling democracies in East Europe.
   He told a news conference that the 152-nation fund might be able
to provide technical assistance to the Soviet Union, although that
country would not qualify for direct financial aid.
   Leaders of the seven industrialized nations at the economic
summit in Houston have proposed the IMF take part in a detailed
study of Soviet economic needs.
   Camdessus, who was in Geneva to speak to the United Nation's
Economic and Social Council, outlined a series of recommendations
for East European countries moving away from centrally planned
economies.
   Warning against half measures, he stressed market reform
programs must be introduced as rapidly as possible and must be as
general as possible for them to succeed.
   ``You can't take a little liberalization of prices, a little
autonomy of enterprises ... a little less state regulation because
that doesn't work,'' he said.
   He also emphasized the need for a ``social safety net'' to
cushion the impact of the reforms on vulnerable sectors of the
population.
   ``The passage to a market economy does not create poverty, but
it reveals it. The characteristics of a centralized economy are
unemployment and inflation in waiting. When you liberalize prices
... these increase,'' he said.
   The Washington-based IMF provides loans to Third World countries
in exchange for promises of economic reform. The fund currently has
about $175 billion.

   The stock market turned upward today, bouncing
back from Tuesday's late slump.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 23.27 points on
Tuesday, rose 22.53 to 2,913.37 by noontime today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading

   Analysts noted some tentative buying interest among traders
looking for short-term ``bargains'' after Tuesday's drop in prices.

   The EC Commission urged its member
states Wednesdasy to help East European nations draft key legal
frameworks, including corporate, banking and tax laws, to improve
investment conditions there.
   It's not enough, the commission said, for the new East European
democracies to only acquire capital goods and new technologies and
engage in joint ventures with the West.
   ``They also need help in creating an entirely new legal,
administrative, banking and tax environment in order to pave the
way for industrial expansion and to improve the conditions for
foreign investors,'' the Commission said in a report to the 12 EC
states.
   Western companies still complain about the lack of
communications and banking facilities, ``a defective or
non-existing network of services, bureaucratic procedures and the
non-convertibility or, at any rate, insufficient convertibility of
currencies,'' the report said.
   The Commission made a series of proposals to boost East-West
trade, including providing help in drafting company laws and
legislation on fair competition.

<TEXT>
   Paramount Communications Inc. has boosted its
majority stake in a company that owns six television stations to
83.3 percent and offered to buy the remaining interest for about
$52 million.
   Paramount, the entertainment and publishing giant, said Tuesday
in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had
agreed to purchase 757,852 shares of TVX Broadcast Group Inc. stock
from Citicorp Venture Capital Ltd. and First Capital Corp. of
Chicago.
   It said the purchase boosted its stake in the company to 83.3
percent from about 79 percent.
   At the same time, Paramount said it offered to buy the remaining
7 million shares or equivalents that it does not control for $7.50
a share, or about $52 million.
   In national over-the-counter trading, TVX jumped $2 a share
Tuesday to $7.25 in the wake of the Paramount announcement.
   Paramount acquired control of TVX last December from Salomon
Brothers Holding Co., paying $110 million and assuming debt
estimated at about $30 million.
   TVX owns TV stations WTXF in Philadelphia, WDCA in Washington,
D.C., KTXA in Dallas, KTXH in Houston, WLFL in Raleigh-Durham,
N.C., and KRRT in San Antonio, Texas.
   In April, the Federal Communications Commission approved a
petition by a Paramount affiliate to take control of TVX.
   Paramount said its acquisition of the TV stations ``broadens our
participation in the television industry and provides a strong base
for expansion in broadcasting.''
   Paramount is a major supplier of television programs.

   Some 2,300 workers on Wednesday ended a 14-week
strike at Waterford Wedgwood Group PLC's crystal-making operations
in Ireland, the company said.
   Waterford said it would begin phasing in production Wednesday
night.
   The plant shut down April 5 when workers refused to implement a
cost-cutting plan. The company has suffered losses in the past
three years, partly because of a weaker dollar and its dependence
on the U.S. market.
   Workers now have accepted some of the cost cuts, and management
and the unions have agreed to refer issues still in dispute to
binding arbitration, the company said.
   In a statement, Waterford Wedgwood Chairman Paddy Byrne said,
``Whilst I am obviously pleased that a formula has been agreed that
allows a return to work, it must be recognized that we still have a
long way to go in order to transform Waterford Crystal into a
robust and profitable part of Waterford Wedgwood Group.
   ``Until this is achieved, the future of the crystal division
will not be secure,'' he said.

   West Virginia University has stopped
accepting money from tobacco giant R.J. Reynolds Co. for tobacco
growth research, university President Neil Bucklew said.
   The university had continued to accept Reynolds funding after
announcement of a ban on the sale and use of all tobacco products
on university property, beginning July 1.
   But a committee formed by Bucklew recommended that the
university stop accepting the grants due to the negative health
effects of tobacco use.
   The school has received $168,000 in grants from Winston-Salem,
N.C.-based Reynolds since 1977.
   West Virginia ranks second in the nation in tobacco-related
deaths, with almost 3,300 each year, said Dr. Fred Butcher,
director of the university's Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center.
   The campus smoking ban grew out of concern about the effects of
second-hand smoke.

   Stock prices soared on London's Stock Exchange
Wednesday, boosted by a weaker pound and a strong performance on
Wall Street.
   The rise in U.S. shares helped London sustain early gains caused

   The low, a decline of 2.9 points, came at the start of trading.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 22.7 points at 1,877.7
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 14.86 points

   The U.S. dollar gained against the major
currencies in European trading on Wednesday in what dealers said
was a modest rebound from its sharp decline of Tuesday.
   Gold prices moved higher.
   Foreign exchange dealers said that despite the dollar's better
showing it was still weak against the yen, while high interest
rates were still shoring up European currencies.
   They said the final communique from the Group of Seven richest
nations in Washington had little effect on their markets.
   The British pound lost 1.75 cents after zooming to an 18-month
high of 1.8155 dollars Tuesday.
   Dealers agreed there was room for a modest correction of the
pound, which moved strongly on speculation that Britain will soon
enter the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System,
designed to curb exchange rate fluctuations.
   However, they said the pound should remain firm because of the
government-imposed 15 percent base interest rate on bank lending to
curb inflation. The high interest rate continues to attract
investor money to London.
   One British pound cost $1.7980 in London late Wednesday, cheaper
for buyers than Tuesday's $1.8155. At midday in New York, sterling
was quoted at $1.79825.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Tuesday's prices,
included: 1.6507 West German marks, up from 1.6465; 1.4030 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3945; 5.5285 French francs, up from 5.5270;
1.8582 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8555; 1,207.04 Italian lire, up
from 1,207.00; and 1.1586 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1570.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at 148.10 Japanese yen, a new
4{-month low and down from 149.60. In London late Wednesday the
dollar closed higher at 148.64 yen, and in New York, it was quoted
at midday at 148.65 yen.
   Other selected midday quotes for the dollar in New York
included: 1.6500 West German marks; 1.4000 Swiss francs; 1,208.25
Italian lire; and 1.15925 Canadian dollars.
   Gold bullion prices rose by 70 cents in London and 20 cents in
Zurich after declines of $4 Tuesday on reports that between 10 and
15 tons of the metal had been unloaded by Middle East sources.
   Gold dealers said there was good demand from industrial
consumers and some professional interest but investor interest was
still lacking and there was general resistance to gold going much
above the $355 level.
   In London, the major market, the late bid price of gold was
$354.45 a troy ounce, up from $353.75. The late bid price in Zurich
was $354.10 up from $353.90.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $354.15 bid a troy ounce,
down from $358.25.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $4.84 a troy
ounce, up from $4.82.

<TEXT>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has
filed a federal lawsuit charging that United Parcel Service
discriminated against employees on the basis of religion.
   The lawsuit said Greenwich, Conn.-based UPS has failed to allow
a religious exception to the company's practice of prohibiting
employees with beards from working in positions that deal with the
public.
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in a Chicago federal court, alleges
UPS violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing
to accommodate the religious practices of employees and job
applicants. The act prohibits employment discrimination based on
race, religion, sex or national origin.
   ``Title VII requires that an employer try to `reasonably
accommodate' employees' or applicants' religious beliefs or
practices whenever the employer can do so without incurring undue
hardship,'' said Zachary Tobin, trial lawyer for the EEOC's Chicago
office.
   The commission is seeking back pay and job offers for people
denied consideration for public contact positions because they wear
beards for religious reasons. The EEOC also is asking for an
injunction to prevent UPS from engaging in any employment practices
which discriminate on the basis of religion.
   The class-action lawsuit was sparked by a complaint the
commission received a year ago from former UPS employee Ayub Patel,
whose request to become a UPS driver was denied, Tobin said.
   ``But anyone who has ever worked or applied for a job with UPS
could seek relief if this lawsuit prevails,'' Tobin said.
   Efforts today to obtain comment from a UPS spokesman at its
Connecticut headquarters were unsuccessful.

<HEAD>American to Increase Ticket Price at Five Airports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines Inc. is adding $1 to
$4 to the cost of a ticket at five airports to help pay for what it
calls ``exorbitant and intolerable'' fees at airports.
   Other airlines said they would not follow the lead of the
nation's largest carrier, and analysts don't expect the surcharges
to establish a norm within the industry.
   ``I don't see that as any particular trend,'' said Lee Howard,
vice president of consulting firm Airline Economics Inc. in
Washington. ``It deals with a specific issue which has arisen, and
American Airlines has chosen to see that way as covering what they
consider to be excessive expenses.''
   Al Becker, spokesman for Fort Worth-based American, said the
increased charges will amount to about $4 million a year. They will
take effect Sunday at New York's LaGuardia Airport, Newark
International Airport, New Orleans International Airport, Palm
Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Fla., and Southwest
Florida Regional in Fort Myers, Fla.
   The fees range from $4 per ticket in Newark to $1.50 in New
Orleans and $1 for the other three airports. Analysts doubted the
increases would affect American's business because they are small
compared to average ticket prices of $200.
   The fees will be applied only to local boardings at those
airports, so they will not affect people passing through or coming
home, the company said.
   ``It's very simple and straightforward,'' Becker said. ``At
those five airports we are covering what we believe to be excessive
and unreasonable costs. It only makes good business sense to do
that.''
   Becker said increases involve ``budget overages or charges at
those specific airports that go far beyond what they ought to be,''
Becker said.
   At LaGuardia, for example, the complaint involves a floor
covering used in renovations.
   American is not trying to exert control over budgets at local
airports, Becker said, but ``we are in the position of explaining
to the airports what we believe is fair and equitable, based on our
experience.''
   ``There is simply no way that we can tolerate those sorts of
unreasonable charges,'' said Becker, who noted that two or three
years ago American implemented a similar surcharge at the Las Vegas
airport because the local airport authority wanted to build an
``outlandishly extravagant'' new terminal.
   ``In the end, the airport changed its plans,'' he said.
   The fees, however, did not sit well with some groups.
   American is attempting ``to make the public think'' that the
surcharge is the airport's fault, said Robert Inman, properties
manager for Palm Beach International. Inman said the fees American
pays at West Palm Beach actually will drop by 14 percent beginning
in October.
   ``This is a gimmick to justify increased fares,'' charged David
Blackshear, director of airports for New Orleans.
   Consumer advocate David Livingston, president of Airline
Passengers of North America, also objected to the surcharge.
``Every time the price of a legal pad goes up, you don't
automatically pass it on to the client,'' he said.
   Becker said the surcharges are unrelated to a bill pending in
Congress that would allow airports to charge up to $3 in
``passenger facility charges.''
   Airports would be allowed to collect the fees to increase
capacity, enhance safety or security, or reduce noise.
   American is one of the airlines supporting the legislation,
according to Bob Bunnell, spokesman for the Airport Operators
Council International, a trade group in Washington.
   American, the principal subsidiary of AMR Corp., last year had
$9.96 billion in revenues and earned $730.8 million.

   Inside a cluster of plush buildings
baked by the Silicon Valley sun, Apple Computer Inc. employees
wearing sport shirts and jeans are readying products they hope will
revive the company's breathtaking growth.
   Their casual dress and California-ready smiles belie the
seriousness of their task: to overcome a major challenge to Apple's
main product, the Macintosh, and revamp what critics call a tired,
overpriced product line. The combination has caused sales growth to
slow and Apple's stock price to falter.
   The personal computer giant, hatched in a garage 14 years ago,
also must dispel the appearance of instability created by recent
leadership changes.
   Since January, Apple lost its product-development chief and the
president of its domestic marketing operation. In addition, its top
U.S. sales executive moved to part-time status, and a senior
scientist who helped develop the Macintosh announced earlier this
month he was quitting to form his own company.
   ``There is nothing technically wrong with Apple's products and
it has plenty of room for growth,'' said Richard Shaffer, publisher
of Technologic Computer Letter, an industry newsletter. ``But the
company has taken too long to get some products out and it has not
had its marketing act together.''
   Although Apple remains one of America's most dynamic and least
indebted young companies, the executive changes haven't helped
answer the persistent question of who's in charge.
   ``You can't have the management turnover like they had at Apple
without problems,'' Shaffer said.
   Last month, Apple finally named a new president for the domestic
division, an important post vacant for six months. Robert Puette, a
longtime Hewlett-Packard Co. executive, expressed confidence in his
new employer.
   ``I think the turmoil is going to pretty well disappear and
you're going to see some strong marketing messages from the
company,'' he said.
   Those messages will be needed, since Apple must respond to the
most serious threat yet to the Macintosh's primacy.
   The 6-year-old computer is acclaimed for a graphics-based
operating system that makes it easy even for computer novices to
run the machines as soon as they take them out of the box.
   The Macintosh popularized the use of an on-screen arrow,
manipulated with a device called a mouse. By moving the arrow to
pictures on the screen and pushing a button on the mouse, users can
open computer files, print copies and perform other tasks.
   By comparison, on most International Business Machines Corp.
computers and IBM-compatible models, users must type technical
commands.
   But in May, Microsoft Corp. released a much-improved version of
a software product called Windows, which replaces the typed
commands with user-friendly graphics also manipulated by a mouse.
   Though the Macintosh is still easier to use in some respects _
and Windows can't be used on all IBM computers and compatibles _
many analysts believe the new Windows gives computer novices and
others their first real alternative to the Macintosh.
   Another problem facing Apple, critics say, is its pricey
computers.
   The Macintosh line is about 25 percent costlier than comparable
models from IBM and Compaq Computer Corp., two major competitors,
said Rick Martin, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Before Windows, Apple could charge a premium for its machines
because of their relative ease of use, Martin said.
   ``You take that wide (price) gap and throw Windows on top of it,
and you now have the beginnings of what could be a major problem,''
he said.
   Joeann Stahel, president of Storeboard-Computer Intelligence,
said surveys her market research firm takes of computer dealers
show that lowering the price of Macintoshes is a priority.
   ``The dealers were very concered about Apple's pricing in a
market where you've got such heavy competiton from the (IBM) PC
compatibles,'' she said.
   Last month, IBM announced a new home computer line that could
spell more trouble for Apple. The machines feature a mouse and
on-screen graphics designed to make them easy to use, though they
aren't as sophisticated as a Macintosh. But the low end of the line
costs $999, vs. the cheapest Macintosh at $1799.
   Apple sold $4 billion worth of Macintoshes last year, by far the
most important product it offers. Faced with new assaults, Apple
isn't standing still.
   Later this year, the company plans to introduce lower-priced
versions of the Macintosh, with both color and black-and-white
screens.
   Mike Homer, director of domestic product marketing, said a
lower-priced Macintosh with a color monitor is ``clearly a hardware
product hole we have to plug.'' Apple's cheapest color Macintosh
today lists for $4,669, while IBM clones with color screens cost
thousands less.
   To reduce the cost of Macintoshes, Apple most likely will limit
the number of options on new models and accept a lower profit
margin, said Jim Davis, Apple's director of operating system
software.
   Martin said he expects the new low-end color Macintosh will cost
$2,000 to $2,500. Ms. Stahel said she has heard the low-end
black-and-white Macintosh will sell for about $1,000. Apple
wouldn't comment on pricing plans.
   Besides lower-priced computers, Apple recently introduced
cheaper laser printers in response to challenges from competitors.
It also is readying a new version of its operating system, which
controls a computer's basic functions such as organizing files,
that will enhance the Macintosh's performance.
   Not all Apple's products need facelifts. The company revamped
the top end of the Macintosh line over the past year, and says
sales of these expensive, high-powered machines, aimed at corporate
users, are strong.
   Meanwhile, Apple officials say the hype about Windows benefited
Apple, since it drew more attention to graphics-based computing
systems. Davis contends the Macintosh will win any comparison with
a Window-equipped IBM or compatible computer.
   Apple executives and industry analysts also point out that the
library of software that takes advantage of Windows' capabilities
is small compared with the several thousand Macintosh programs on
the market.
   In coming months, Apple's advertising will more clearly point
out these differences, Davis said.
   ``Some of the ads in the U.S. were a little fuzzy,'' he said.
   Shaffer agreed. ``Unless Apple begins to stress those
still-important differences, Apple will lose market share,'' he
said.
   Infocorp, a market research firm that tracks computer sales,
reckons Apple's sales fell in the first three months of this year
vs. a year earlier, but since have picked up. Analysts say Apple
holds about 10 percent of worldwide personal computer market.
   This is hardly Apple's first slump. The company's history has
been shaped by booms and busts since its founding in a garage by
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976. Its current malaise is a mild
headache compared with the turmoil, layoffs and financial losses
that led to Jobs' ouster in 1985.
   Despite the current troubles, Apple's finances are strong. The
company has almost no debt and about $1 billion in cash on hand.
Analysts expect its profit will grow at least 10 percent in the
fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.
   However, Apple's stock price has suffered, reflecting some
pessimism in its ability to continue the quantum-leap innovations
that first made the company a household word in the late '70s.
   Soon after Windows premiered, Apple shares slumped from the
mid-40s into the high $30s, though it recent weeks the stock has
moved sharply higher.
   ``This company is doing just fine,'' said Martin. ``But all the
turmoil caused investors to be very, very nervous.''

keyboard or case. They call it Apple I.
   April 1976 _ Wozniak and Jobs form the Apple Computer Co. on
April Fool's Day.
   May 1976 _ Jobs sells his Volkswagen and Wozniak sells his
Hewlett-Packard programmable calculator, raising $1,350 to finance
production of Apple I boards. They begin building the boards in
Jobs' garage.
   July 1976 _ Apple I board released for sale to computer
enthusiasts for $666.66.
   November 1976 _ Apple formulates a business plan for sales to

exceeding 300.
   February 1979 _ Apple proclaims its own business goal of ``no
more typewriters.''
   June-September 1980 _ Apple opens customer support and
manufacturing centers in several U.S. locations, as well as Cork,
Ireland and Zeist, the Netherlands, the beginnings of a major
international expansion.
   December 1980 _ Apple goes public in one of the biggest stock
offerings ever undertaken, with 4.6 million shares priced at $22
each snapped up within minutes. Apple's staff surpasses 1,000 and
its distribution network becomes the largest in the world.

<HEAD>Easter Holiday Helps Push Second-Quarter Profits Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safeway Inc. on Wednesday reported a 206
percent jump in second-quarter profits over the same period a year
ago, crediting the Easter holiday for much of the increase.
   Net income for the three months that ended June 16 was $23.6
million, or 25 cents a share, up from $7.7 million, or 10 cents a
share for the same period last year.
   The Easter shopping period, which fell in this year's second
quarter, fell in the first quarter of 1989.
   Second-quarter sales rose 5 percent, from $3.27 billion to $3.4
billion. Although the number of stores at midyear dropped from
1,125 in 1989 to 1,112 this year, square footage rose slightly as
Safeway expanded stores and replaced small markets with larger ones.
   The company also said its interest expense fell in the second
quarter from $90.2 million to $86.4 million, as the result of lower
average borrowings following the initial public offering of 11.5
million shares of common stock in April.
   Earnings for the first half of the year rose 135 percent, from
$16.4 million, or 22 cents a share, in 1989 to $38.6 million or 42
cents a share this year. Sales for the first half of 1990 rose from
$6.5 billion to $6.77 billion.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration says the most useful
thing it can do now for the Soviet Union, rather than send cold,
hard cash, is to give their leaders a few lessons in good old
American know-how.
   As the seven-nation economic summit ended in Houston, President
Bush said he had cabled Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
asking to explain the summit's decision to send technical
assistance to Moscow and commission a study of the Soviet Union's
economic needs.
   ``I'll make clear to President Gorbachev that he ought to view
the outcome of this summit very positively,'' Bush told a news
conference. ``What he can expect is that we'll be helpful to him in
the kinds of reforms that he has to undertake.''
   Bush balked at sending direct U.S. assistance to the Soviets and
repeated his criticism of their $5 billion annual support of
Marxist Cuba. ``I think we will send the kind of help that in the
long run will be most beneficial to them,'' he said.
   Sending experts abroad to help needy countries, known as
``technical assistance'' in foreign-policy jargon, has been a
centerpiece of the U.S. foreign aid program for years. And now it
is a feature of the new spirit of cooperation between the
superpowers.
   Some allies, including West Germany and France, hoped the United
States and other industrial democracies would go much further and
agree at the economic summit in Houston to fashion a coordinated
package of direct assistance to the reeling Soviet economy.
   Bush, among others, resisted. The dispute was blunted, for the
time being, when the seven summit partners agreed instead Tuesday
to organize a quick study of the Soviet Union's needs.
   Meanwhile, the summit leaders gave Gorbachev a warm endorsement
and pledged to ``help in practical ways those countries that choose
freedom.''
   The final communique issued at the close of the summit today
said ``Prospects for fundamental and long-term economic aid could
improve if the Soviet Union comes to a substantial change in
resources from military to civilian production, and ends the
support to those states which create regional conflict.''
   The Western leaders called for group of international financial
institutions, under International Monetary Fund supervision, to
conduct the Soviet study and complete it by year's end. But the
World Bank, part of that group, immediately pronounced the deadline
unrealistic, saying ``a study of this nature would take a long time
_ a year or so.''
   In the interim, for the United States to extend even technical
assistance is a gesture that is downright revolutionary, when
measured by the standards of just 8{ years ago.
   After the Polish government's crackdown, with Soviet
acquiescence, on the Solidarity labor union in December 1981, the
Western allies were debating how severely to punish the Soviets
economically. Now the debate is focused on how much the Kremlin
should be rewarded for its change of heart under Mikhail
Gorbachev's stewardship.
   Bush and Gorbachev set in motion the concept of U.S. technical
assistance at the Malta summit seven months ago. Officials now say
an acceleration of that cooperation may be possible.
   Technical assistance can cover a variety of different endeavors.
In Panama, it means helping the government form a new police force.
In Nicaragua, U.S. experts are helping to implement the
government's economic policy. In El Salvador, American advisers are
trying to upgrade the country's woefully deficient judicial system.
   The U.S. position on the Soviet Union is that direct aid would
merely be wasted by a system plagued by gross inefficiencies. Baker
said on Tuesday the biggest favor the West could do for the Soviets
would be to offer its advice to help Gorbachev achiev his goal of
streamlining the Soviet economy. A number of private experts agree
with that approach.
   Some ideas which are at various stages of discussion include
helping the Soviets devise a consumer price index and a stock
market in a transition to a market economy.
   Leon Aron of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research
group, said the United States is uniquely positioned among the
allies to offer advice on these areas to a country as large as the
Soviet Union because of the scale of the U.S. economy.
   Aron rejected the suggestion of some European nations that
direct financial aid to the Soviet Union is feasible. He said that
because of systemic inefficiencies, there is $8 billion worth of
imported equipment languishing unopened in Soviet ports.
   ``A blank check is wasted,'' he said.
   Ed A. Hewitt of the Brookings Institution said U.S. experts
could aid the Soviets in overcoming such problems as getting food
to the market place. About a third of all Soviet food rots before
reaching the dinner table because of inadequate transportation or
storage facilities, he said.
   Both Hewitt and Richard Feinberg, executive vice president of
the Overseas Development Council, strongly support a major role for
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in helping the
Soviets.
   Financial stabilization and structural changes are sorely needed
in the Soviet Union and are precisely the areas the bank and the
fund have been set up to deal with, Feinberg said.
   The IMF makes loans to developing countries providing they agree
to undertake measures that it believes are necessary to put them on
a sounder economic footing.
   Feinberg says that among the IMF's success stories are Turkey,
Mexico, Bolivia and Chile. Critics argue that IMF policies have
impoverished some countries.
   The Soviets are not now in a position to benefit from the fund
or the bank because they are not members of either institution. But
they have indicated a desire to join, and the Bush administration
reportedly is weighing options on the subject.
   There are other ways the United States could help the Soviets
short of direct assistance.
   As an example, if the Kremlins drop barriers to emigration, the
United States could waive the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment,
thereby permitting normal trade between the two countries.
   That step, in turn, could be followed by U.S. trade credits and
the easing of high technology exports. The Soviets may act on the
emigration question in September.
   Will direct U.S. aid ever be in the cards?
   ``I don't think you should ever say never,'' Baker said Tuesday.
``Things can change.''

   The stock market turned upward today, rebounding
from Tuesday's setback.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 23.27 points on
Tuesday, rose 24.01 to 2,914.85 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 855 up, 553 down and
540 unchanged.
   Analysts noted some tentative buying interest among traders
looking for short-term ``bargains'' after Tuesday's drop in prices.
   But many observers questioned whether the market could launch a
sustained rally as earnings reports for the second quarter begin to
come out in earnest.
   Projections and results issued by a fairly broad sampling of
companies to date have produced a series of negative surprises.
Brokers say that has put investors in a generally cautious mood
about chasing after stocks for which profit figures are still due.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up | at
48}; General Electric, up } at 71{; Exxon, up | at 47&rsqb;, and Abbott
Laboratories, up { at 43\.
   Hilton Hotels, which reported lower second-quarter earnings on
Tuesday, dropped 1} to 51\.
   Oracle Systems fell 2| to 19} as the most heavily traded issue
in the over-the-counter market. The company posted an earnings gain
for the fiscal quarter ended in May that came in below expectations.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.40 to 196.16. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .69 at 358.42.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 127.56 million shares with an

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are considering filing a
negligence lawsuit against President Bush's son Neil and other
former directors of a failed Colorado savings and loan, a
government spokesman says.
   Meanwhile, the Office of Thrift Supervision released documents
charging that Neil Bush engaged in ``one of the worst kinds'' of
conflict of interest when he served as an outside director of
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver.
   President Bush reiterated today his ``confidence in the honor
and integrity'' of his son and renewed his promise not to interfere
with the regulators' investigation.
   ``If he's done something wrong, the system will digest that,''
the president told a news conference in Houston following the
economic summit. ``This is not easy for me as a father; it's easy
for me as a president. I am determined to stay out of this.''
   The OTS documents revealed new details of Silverado's
operations, alleging in specific cases that Bush violated his
responsibility as a director to see that the thrift was run in the
best interests of its shareholders.
   The regulators said Bush ``did everything in his power to bring
about a regulatory violation. The reason no violation occurred was
beyond his control. Bush's conduct was clearly contrary to
generally accepted standards of prudent operation.''
   The documents also alleged that Bush was ``unqualified and
untrained'' for his position as a Silverado director.
   ``Certainly he had no experience in managing a large
corporation, especially a financial institution with almost $2
billion in assets,'' the documents said. ``Unfortunately, he was
not cognizant of the conflict-of-interest situations he encountered
as a director of Silverado. ...Inexperience does not excuse Neil
Bush from the harm and potential harm he caused.''
   Silverado's December 1988 collapse is expected to cost taxpayers
an estimated $1 billion.
   Bush, 34, has denied any wrongdoing. He said Tuesday in an
interview with The Associated Press in Denver that he and the
collapsed thrift were victimized ``by a system that was doomed to
fail, has failed and will continue to fail.''
   A $200 million suit against former directors of Silverado has
been authorized by William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., ABC News reported Tuesday.
   But FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said the suit is still under
consideration. He declined to comment on the $200 million figure or
to provide any other details.
   ``No final decision to bring such a suit has been made,''
Whitney said. He said ``it's not uncommon'' for the FDIC to file
suits against directors in cases of savings and loan failure.
   Bush told ABC he was not aware of an FDIC lawsuit against him.
His attorney, James Nesland, said after the broadcast he also was
unaware of any pending suit.
   In one of the most highly publicized thrift collapses, the FDIC
last year filed a $1.3 billion suit against Charles Keating Jr. and
other directors of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine,
Calif.
   Neil Bush has been ordered by regulators to answer allegations
of conflict of interest in his role as a director of Silverado,
which loaned millions of dollars to a Bush business partner who
never repaid the money.
   Bush said Tuesday the investigation by regulators is
``self-serving.''
   ``The regulators are politically motivated,'' he told the AP in
Denver.
   Bush said he had performed properly, and that all loans that
came before the directors were for projects previously approved by
others more knowledgeable than he.
   Several former Silverado executives have settled charges with
regulators and have effectively been barred from future positions
in the thrift and banking industry.
   OTS has alleged that Bush, who served on the board of Silverado
from August 1985 to August 1988, voted to approve loans or business
deals totaling more than $45 million to a business partner, Bill L.
Walters.
   An administrative law judge is scheduled to hear the Bush case
Sept. 25 in Denver before making a recommendation to OTS Director
Timothy Ryan.
   ABC said the lawsuit would charge that the negligence of
Silverado's directors partly caused the losses. The network quoted
an unnamed source as saying that the negligence was ``particularly
egregious.''
   It said the suit would contend the Silverado directors acted
irresponsibly in approving dozens of questionable loans. The
evidence for the suit, ABC said, includes a memo in which a top
Silverado executive acknowledged that the board was a ``rubber
stamp'' for the thrift's officers when it approved several loans.
   Bush and other former directors and officers of Silverado
testified in hearings in May and June before the House Banking
Committee.
   President Bush, who has pledged to vigorously prosecute fraud in
the savings and loan industry, has said he has ``full confidence in
the integrity and honor'' of his son. The president also has
promised not to interfere with the investigation.
   The OTS documents alleging conflict of interest by Neil Bush
were first disclosed in reports by The Denver Post, The Rocky
Mountain News and The Washington Post.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Retreat on Bearish Production Outlook</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices retreated
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as some analysts increased
their corn and soybean production forecasts in light of beneficial
crop weather in the Midwest.
   Last week, for example, market analysts were projecting a U.S.
corn crop of 7.6 billion to 7.7 billion bushels.
   But by Wednesday some observers were predicting a corn harvest
of as much as 8.3 billion bushels, said William Biedermann,
research director with the commodities brokerage Allendale Inc. in
Crystal Lake, Ill.
   ``Those kind of numbers scared speculators out of the
marketplace,'' he said.
   Analysts are increasing their production estimates because
weather conditions in the Midwest have been ideal for crop
development after an unusually wet spring.
   ``The weather in the main Corn Belt and the main Soybean Belt is
absolutely perfect at the moment,'' said John Frazier, director of
agricultural futures trading for Gerald Inc. in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1\ cents to 3 cents lower with
July at $3.04\ a bushel; corn was 3\ cents to 4{ cents lower with
July at $2.79{ a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 5 cents lower with
July at $1.25{ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 10 cents lower
with July at $6.09 a bushel.

   Federal officials are considering lawsuits to
recover misspent funds from the officers and directors of 1,300
failed banks and savings institutions, a top regulator said today.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., said suits already have been filed against 500 institutions.
Approximately $100 million was recovered last year and more than
$200 million in the first half of this year, he said.
   ``That is in excess of $1 million per day in recoveries'' in
1990, he said.
   The agency's officials said one suit under consideration would
be against the former officers and directors of Silverado Banking,
Savings and Loan Association, a Denver thrift whose December 1988
collapse cost taxpayers approximately $1 billion.
   One of President Bush's sons, Neil, would be among the
defendants.
   Separately, FBI officials announced in Dallas that they have
charged the former chairman of a Texas savings and loan with fraud.
Edward T. McBirney III, former president of Sunbelt Savings
Association, one of the Texas' costliest failures, was indicted in
connection with a $700 million real estate scheme.
   Seidman's remarks came in testimony prepared for the House
Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice, chaired by Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y. The panel is reviewing a package of reforms
designed to speed the government's anti-fraud effort.
   The legislation, a version of which was passed by a House
Banking subcommittee two weeks ago, was endorsed by Seidman, Office
of Thrift Supervision Director Timothy Ryan and James G. Richmond,
a newly appointed Justice Department official in charge of
prosecuting bank and thrift fraud
   It would provide more money to hire investigators and attorneys
to prosecute fraud, prevent people convicted of fraud from evading
restitution by filing for bankruptcy, and allow regulators and
prosecutors to ask a judge to freeze the assets of those accused of
fraud even before they are found guilty.
   In another development, the board of the Resolution Trust Corp.
voted 4-0 Tuesday to adopt a new strategy, trying to save
taxpayers' money by closing troubled thrifts just before, rather
than after, the institutions fail.
   Seidman said the new ``accelerated resolutions program'' will
become the ``preferred course of action'' for handling failing
thrifts.
   Officials estimate they could use the program for between 155
and 180 of the 260 S&amp;Ls expected to fail over the next year. They
plan to see how it works with 10 institutions over the summer.
   Congress has been holding hearings on S&amp;L fraud for months, but
the issue in recent weeks has become politically charged, with
Democrats and Republicans each blaming the other for creating the
crisis. Democrats have been hammering particularly hard at
conflict-of-interest allegations made by regulators against Neil
Bush.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision released documents charging
that Neil Bush engaged in ``one of the worst kinds'' of conflict of
interest when he served as an outside director of Silverado. The
documents alleged in specific cases that Bush violated his
responsibility as a director to see that the thrift was run in the
best interests of its shareholders.
   Schumer, in his opening remarks, acknowledged that the S&amp;L issue
had become politicized. But, he said, ``if the flames of partisan
passions lit a fire under the administration to prosecute S&amp;L
thieves, so be it.''
   ``There is a volcano of frustration among the American people
that these white collar crooks are going unprosecuted. I am very
worried that if the government cannot prosecute these huge crimes
fully and efficiently, there will be an eruption of real anger and
cynicism from the American people,'' he said.
   Richmond, the Justice Department's special counsel for financial
institutions, said, ``We are acutely aware that the American people
want the savings and loan wrongdoers swiftly and appropriately
punished. We do, too.''
   Seidman said fraud has been discovered in about half of the 460
S&amp;Ls seized by the government since February 1989. In 40 percent of
the institutions, fraud contributed significantly to an S&amp;Ls
failure, he said.
   ``Many were owned or dominated by one individual and operated
more like real estate development organizations, investment banks,
or mutual funds than thrift institutions,'' he said. ``This
situation allows for abuse and lack of control.''

   The new managing editor of Entertainment Weekly
says readers can expect more changes at the five-month-old startup
magazine that has become one of the industry's most closely-watched
launches.
   James W. Seymore Jr. took over the top editorial post at the new
magazine from Time Warner Inc. last month after the founding
managing editor, Jeff Jarvis, resigned over ``creative
differences'' with senior management.
   Entertainment Weekly has commanded intense interest since its
launch in February because it is the first weekly from the Time
Inc. Magazine Co. since the costly failure of its TV-Cable Week
magazine in 1983.
   It also is being watched to see how even-handed a publication
can be when it is offering opinions on movies, music and the like
from sister companies and their competitors.
   Media analysts also wonder how patient debt-heavy Time Warner
will be for the magazine to become profitable. Time Warner has a
$10.6 billion debt resulting from Time Inc.'s purchase last year of
Warner Communications Inc.
   Magazine executives refuse to disclose how the magazine is doing
financially. Startup costs reportedly were more than $30 million.
Publisher Michael J. Klingensmith said it is on target with an
average 600,000 circulation and is ahead of projections in ad
revenues despite a weak market.
   Jarvis and Klingensmith are credited for separately conceiving
the concept for the magazine six years ago. Entertainment Weekly's
mission would be to give busy people a one-stop guide on how to
entertain themselves.
   The heart of the magazine has been reviews of entertainment
products _ television, movies, music, videos, books and magazines.
Feature stories focused on how the products were made, not gossip
about the celebrities in them.
   After less than three weeks on the new job, Seymore said in an
interview that reviews would remain the centerpiece, but added the
magazine has ``a wider mandate.''
   He wants more feature and news coverage of entertainment, such
as the magazine's recent stories on TV's use of FBI videotapes of
Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry's drug arrest.
   Seymore wants more information on the opinion pages than readers
have been getting to help them decide what might be worthwhile to
watch, read or hear.
   And he said readers can look for shorter reviews and features.
   Some staffers feared Jarvis' departure meant the magazine would
become another version of People, the personality magazine also
from Time Warner.
   But Seymore, 47, the former executive editor of People, said
that isn't his intention. ``Our focus will be strictly and
exclusively on entertainment and informing people about what is
going on,'' he said.
   Seymore said he generally agrees with the design changes
implemented a few weeks before Jarvis resigned on June 11.
   The magazine was redesigned in late May in what senior managers
said was a response to complaints from readers and advertisers that
the magazine was cluttered and hard to read.
   The cover was simplified, the logo straightened and a column
that ran along the edge of each cover touting other stories was
dropped. The ``News &amp; Notes'' columns that ran along the edges of
each section were given separate pages at the end of each section.
A bolder typeface and heavier paper were used.
   The magazine also adopted a new approach to choosing cover
topics. Instead of running covers relating to products just being
released, cover stories now will focus on products that have been
out for awhile.
   The old approach left the magazine with some arcane and esoteric
covers, such as one about Vietnam novels, said the magazine group's
editorial director, Richard Stolley. The new approach will mean
more mainstream covers which could help sales, he said.
   Jarvis declined comment on his reasons for resigning.
   His colleagues say he chafed under senior managment's heavy
involvement in the magazine and felt it was becomimg too
celebrity-oriented.
   Stolley and the magazine group's editor in chief, Jason McManus,
and corporate editor Gilbert Rogin became involved in editing and
layout for four to five weeks before Jarvis decided to resign.
   Analysts remain divided on the magazine's prospects.
   Magazine consultant Martin S. Walker said the original magazine
covered too many subjects and was too intellectual to attract a
mass audience every week. Walker also thinks it is too late to save
it.
   But John Gray, a top media planner at the ad agency J. Walter
Thompson, said he remains bullish on the magazine. ``There is a
tendency to expect that a new magazine will come out of the womb
already perfect and grown up, and that's unrealistic,'' he said.

   The stock market swept ahead to a 3{-week high

   The advance picked up momentum as the session progressed,
propelled by computer-program buying from professional traders
engaged in multiple strategies involving stock-index options and
futures.
   Analysts said stocks also seemed to benefit from a slight
decline in open-market interest rates.
   Prices of long-term government bonds edged upward in the credit
markets, putting their yields in the 8.55 percent-8.60 percent
range.
   But perhaps the biggest plus, brokers said, was the market's
steady showing of late in the face of a succession of

   William Atkinson, one of Apple Computer
Inc.'s leading scientists, has left the personal computer maker to
form a new company with two other former employees, Apple announced
Wednesday.
   The new venture, General Magic Inc., will design and develop a
``personal intelligent communicator,'' said Andrew Hertzfeld, a
founder of the new company and one of the architects of Apple's
Macintosh. He declined to elaborate except to say it will be two
years before the product is on the market.
   Atkinson's move follows departures this year by several senior
Apple executives, notably its product-development chief and the
head of its domestic sales operation.
   Apple will become a minority investor and the largest corporate
shareholder in the new company. Hertzfeld declined to say how much
Apple has invested in General Magic or how much equity it holds,
but said it has the option to increase its stake.
   Apple also holds the first non-exclusive license to manufacture
and market General Magic's technologies, and Apple Chairman and CEO
John Sculley will serve on its board of directors.
   Atkinson, who developed the HyperCard software technology for
Apple, will be chairman of General Magic. Former Apple engineer
Marc Porat, another founder of General Magic, will be president of
the new company, which will be based in Mountain View.
   HyperCard, an accessory for Macintosh computers, stores
information for database applications as well as sound, animation
and video. It is designed to make multimedia presentations.
   Atkinson will continue to work with Apple as a consultant, Apple
said.
   Sculley said in a statement that Apple decided to ``spin out''
the new project because General Magic will address sections of the
market outside Apple's mainstream business.

<HEAD>Posts 16 Percent Rise in Second-Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. said Wednesday its second-quarter
profit rose 16 percent as an improved performance by its
broadcasting operations offset a decline in interest income.
   Despite the latest improvement, Chief Executive Laurence A.
Tisch said the profit outlook remained uncertain because of a
sluggish national economy, intensified competition for viewers and
increased sports rights costs.
   CBS, which operates the CBS Television Network as well as TV and
radio stations, said it earned $138 million, or $5.36 a share, in
the three months ended June 30 compared with $118.8 million, or
$4.62 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 7 percent to $829 million from $772 million a year
earlier.
   Operating profit for the broadcast group rose 31 percent to
$180.9 million in the quarter as the CBS TV network reported a
significant increase in operating income because of lower
prime-time programming costs and revenues from added National
Basketball Association playoff games.
   Programming costs had been unusually high in the second quarter
of 1989 because of the impact of a writers' strike. The strike
delayed the start of the 1988-89 television season and resulted in
the debut of more first-run series than normal in the second
quarter last year, adding to programming costs.
   This year, CBS Sports had more broadcasts of NBA playoff and
championship series games, boosting second-quarter revenue.
   The CBS TV network also benefitted from a second-place showing
in the prime-time audience ratings during the May sweeps period,
when benchmarks are set for advertising rates. The network was
third for the full season, however.
   The CBS TV and radio stations each had higher sales and profits
for the quarter despite softness on local advertising.
   Net corporate interest income amounted to $44.0 million in the
quarter, down from $54.6 million a year earlier when interest
income was augmented by a pretax gain of $13.8 million resulting
from the sale of securities.
   For the six months ended June 30, CBS said it earned $223.2
million, or $8.67 per share, up 28 percent from $174.9 million, or
$6.80 a share, a year earlier.
   First-half revenue rose 12 percent to $1.68 billion from $1.50
billion a year earlier.

   Teetering trade barriers in the west and the
opening of closed economies in the east have been making Europe as
a whole the target of U.S. automakers, which are moving with
unaccustomed speed to exploit the market.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and to a lesser extent
Chrysler Corp. have engaged in business in Europe for years.
   But more recently they quickly have been setting up joint
manufacturing and supply ventures, establishing marketing
associations and buying all or parts of European automakers as the
Continent begins to emerge as the world's largest auto market.
   Trade barriers among the 12-member European Economic Community
are to be eliminated in 1992, creating an auto market larger than
North America.
   The market would swell further if free trade agreements are
reached between the dozen EC members and other Western and Eastern
European nations.
   General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, each facing weakening
performances at home, increasingly are looking to Europe as a
source of profits and a market for excess U.S. manufacturing
capacity.
   Auto analyst David Healy, of the investment banking firm
Barclays de Zoete Wedd in New York, said Tuesday he expected the
European market to grow to about 13 million cars this year.
Generous estimates put the U.S. car market at about 10 million for
1990.
   ``It's something that's a good deal bigger in just passenger
cars than the United States,'' Healy said. ``Sales have grown a lot
over the last few years, but have sort of leveled out this year.''
   There's potential growth in the European minivan and
sport-utility segments.
   Chrysler, which sparked the popularity of minivans in the United
States, has signed an agreement with Steyr-Daimler-Puch to make
minivans in Austria beginning in Spring 1991. Executives have said
the project also may market right-hand drive vehicles for the
United Kingdom.
   ``I think there is going to be a scramble to either introduce
those vans from the United States or companies building them on
their own,'' Healy said. ``This is something coming very rapidly.''
   Historically, automakers have wanted to build vehicles where
they sell them. That way, they can react quicker to market changes,
avoid import duties and attempt to lessen the stigma of a foreign
company invading the homeland.
   Japanese automakers have used the strategy with great success in
the United States, where they faced pressure to restrict imports.
Seven Japanese companies now operate U.S. ``transplants,'' with
Honda Motor Co. Ltd. having opened the first in November 1982 in
Marysville, Ohio.
   The Big Three have a much older history in Europe. Ford opened a
British assembly plant in 1911, three years after establishing a
sales branch in France and the same year GM set up an exporting
company.
   Since then, Ford and GM have grown substantially in Europe. Each
now has sales or manufacturing operations in more than a dozen
Western European nations. Chrysler has had a small sales presence
on the Continent.
   In 1988, the latest figures available from the Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Association, about 37 percent of Ford's worldwide
production came from its European operations and 25 percent of GM's
came from the region.
   Recent moves have stepped up the pace of European operations.
   GM acquired half of Sweden's Saab Automobile AB, signed an
agreement to begin making cars in East Germany later this year and
agreed to a $150 million investment in a Hungarian vehicle making
plant.
   Ford spent $2.5 billion to acquire the British
luxury-performance car maker Jaguar PLC and has announced that it
is involved in negotiations focusing on heavy truck and farm
implement manufacturing with the huge Italian company Fiat Group.
   Also, GM and the Soviet automaker Volga Auto Works have signed a
$1 billion deal under which GM will supply pollution and engine
control systems to the Soviet company.
   ``It does provide a very good foundation from which to start, to
learn how to do business, learn how to find hotel rooms and make
telephone calls,'' William Hoglund, GM's executive vice president,
said last month in announcing the deal.
   Sixteen months ago, Ford left a consortium of companies looking
into joint ventures with Soviet businesses and is not involved in
any discussions in that nation now.
   At the time of its withdrawal, Ford said a primary problem was
finding a way to convert profits paid in Soviet rubles into
currency traded in international markets.
   Convertibility problems also faced U.S. companies interested in
moving into East Germany. But the recent unification of the West
and East German marks eliminated that hurdle.
   In March, GM signed an agreement to begin making cars this
October in East Germany for the East German market. About 10,000
cars will be made this year, and production will increase to about
150,000 annually by the mid-1990s.
   That's a modest production by U.S. standards, but is expected to
help meet the automobile supply problem in East Germany, where
citizens sometimes wait more than half a year for delivery.

<TEXT>
   A floor broker accused of trying to manipulate
silver prices before the world silver market plunge in 1980 agreed
Wednesday to pay $100,000 to settle administrative charges by
federal futures regulators.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced it had
accepted a settlement offer from Norton Waltuch, a former floor
broker and account executive with the now-defunct firm of
ContiCommodity Services Inc.
   Waltuch and eight other individuals and concerns were accused of
manipulating and attempting to manipulate the price of silver
futures contracts and silver bullion in 1979 and 1980.
   Without admitting or denying the allegations, first made by the
CFTC in February 1985, Waltuch agreed not to violate federal
futures trading laws and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.
   In addition, the CFTC suspended his floor broker registration
for six months and ordered him not to trade for his own account on
the floor of any exchange for six months.
   From September 1979 to mid-January 1980, silver prices rose from
$11 an ounce to an all-time high of $50 an ounce.
   But the price then declined, and on March 27, 1980, the wealthy
Hunt brothers of Dallas couldn't meet a call for $100 million in
silver futures contracts and the world market plummeted to below
$11 an ounce.
   Of the other eight others accused of violations by the CFTC,
cases remain pending against only one, International Metals
Investment Co. Ltd.

   A former president of the Sunbelt Savings
Association has been indicted on bank fraud charges in a $700
million real estate deal, the FBI announced today.
   Edwin T. McBirney III's indictment comes one month after the
indictment of Donald R. Dixon, former owner of the collapsed Vernon
Savings &amp; Loan Association in Texas.
   McBirney is one of four high-profile thrift executives who have
been subpoenaed by the U.S. House Banking Committee to discuss the
billion-dollar failures of their institutions.
   McBirney acquired Sunbelt Savings in 1982 with five associates.
The thrift engaged in high-risk loans that were either unsecured or
inadequately secured by commercial real estate and land, according
to government documents.
   McBirney, under pressure from government regulators, resigned as
chairman in 1986.
   In August 1988, Sunbelt and seven other insolvent thrifts were
consolidated and managed by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp.
   The government spent at least $2.5 billion in that bailout. It
was part of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's Southwest Plan to
consolidate and recapitalize ailing thrifts in the region.
   The 17-count indictment involves the sale of a 708-acre plot of
land in Denton County, north of Dallas.
   The indictment charges that McBirney promised Western Savings
Association, another Dallas thrift, a $6 million profit on any
property Western wanted to sell if Western would provide $30
million in funding to close another transaction.
   That transaction, through Sunbelt subsidiary Sun Cal, involved
approximately $700 million worth of California real estate.
   McBirney, who is expected to surrender Thursday, faces to up 85
years in jail and a $4.25 million fine if convicted.

   Energy futures prices ended higher Wednesday,
boosted by an OPEC resolve to rein in production, a favorable
report on energy stocks and rumor of earthquake damage to Alaska
oil installations, traders said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for August
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
rose 53 cents to $17.47 a 42-gallon barrel, following a 36-cent
rise Tuesday. Later contract months climbed by lesser amounts.
   Gasoline prices also rose. The August contract for wholesale
unleaded gasoline settled .14 cent higher at 58 cents a gallon,
following a 1.01-cent rise Tuesday. Later contract months rose by
greater amounts.
   Among other refined products traded on the Merc, August home

   The market's tone was set by a weekly report from the American

showed a drop in stocks of crude oil and gasoline from the previous

   The stock market rallied with renewed force
Wednesday, climbing close to last month's peaks in spite of
uncertainties over corporate earnings.

971 up, 506 down and 521 unchanged.
   The advance picked up momentum as the session progressed,

   Pharmaceutical and consumer-products stocks chalked up some

<HEAD>Dollar Rises in Modest Rebound; Gold Prices Are Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rebounded modestly Wednesday, but
foreign exchange dealers predicted the U.S. currency would resume
its downward course in short order.
   Gold prices were mixed, moving higher overseas but falling in
later New York trading.
   The dollar picked up more than 2 cents against the British pound
and more than 1 pfennig against the West German mark in New York
trading. Dealers attributed Wednesday's gains to profit-taking as
traders sold other currencies that have soared in recent weeks
against the dollar.
   Dealers cautioned that despite the dollar's better showing it
was still fundamentally weak against the yen, while high interest
rates were still shoring up European currencies including the pound.
   They said the pound should remain firm because of the
government-imposed 15 percent base interest rate on bank lending to
curb inflation. The high interest rate continues to attract
investor money to London.
   The pound has also advanced sharply against other currencies on
speculation Britain will soon enter the Exchange Rate Mechanism of
the European Monetary System, designed to curb exchange rate
fluctuations.
   Karen Gibbs, senior futures analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in Chicago, said the markets were awaiting Friday's expected
release of British inflation figures. If the numbers show an
acceleration of inflation, the Thatcher government is expected to
nudge interest rates even higher and boost the pound in the process.
   Sterling slipped to $1.7995 in New York Wednesday from late
Tuesday's $1.8220. Earlier in London, the pound closed at $1.7980,
down 1.75 cents from $1.8155 late Tuesday.
   The dollar rose to 1.6540 marks in New York, compared with
1.64185 late Tuesday. In earlier European trading, it closed at
1.6507 marks, up from 1.6465.
   The dollar reached a 4{-month low against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo, slipping to 148.10 from late Tuesday's 149.60. However, the
U.S. currency did manage to chalk up a gain in New York, rising to
148.40 yen from late Tuesday's 148.225, and it was quoted at 148.64
yen in late London trading.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
late rates, included: 1.4020 Swiss francs, up from 1.3930; 5.5515
French francs, up from 5.51225; 1,211.25 Italian lire, up from
1,203.00; and 1.15885 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15695.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Tuesday's prices,
included: 1.4030 Swiss francs, up from 1.3945; 5.5285 French
francs, up from 5.5270; 1.8582 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8555;
1,207.04 Italian lire, up from 1,207.00; and 1.1586 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1570.
   Gold bullion prices rose overseas after falling $4 Tuesday on
reports that between 10 and 15 tons of the metal had been unloaded
by Middle East sources. But gold was lower in domestic trading.
   Dealers said there was good demand from industrial consumers and
some professional interest but investor interest was still lacking
and there was general resistance to gold going much above the $355
level.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold fell $1.40 a troy
ounce to $354.10, and Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of
$353.40, also off $1.40 from Tuesday.
   In London, the late bid price was $354.45 a troy ounce, up from
$353.75. The late bid price in Zurich was $354.10 up from $353.90.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $354.15 bid a troy ounce,
down from $358.25.
   Silver prices advanced. On the Commodity Exchange, a troy ounce
rose 2.5 cents to $4.836, and in earlier London trading, silver was
quoted at a bid $4.84, up from late Tuesday's $4.82.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Hit Two-Month High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices leaped to their highest levels in two
months Wednesday amid heavy buying by West German interests and
renewed supply concerns.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals were mixed; grains
nd soybeans retreated; energy futures advanced; and livestock and
meat futures were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 2.9 cents to 5.75 cents higher on New
York's Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in July at
$1.2435 a pound, the highest settlement of a near-term copper
contract since May 11.
   Prices shot up from the opening bell in reaction to a sharp
increase in copper prices on the London Metal Exchange that
analysts attributed to strong buying from West Germany.
   Market ruors linked the buying to a West German company said to
be part of a consortium trying to buy a large state-owned copper
mine in Cananea, Mexico.
   The German firm was believed to have sold forward contracts in
London earlier because it believed the Mexican government would
accept the group's bid for the mine.
   But a Mexican court blocked the transaction, citing a law
forbidding foreign ownership of natural resources, according to the
market rumors.
   The ruling was said to have forced the German company to cover
its market position in London by buying forward contracts, which
caused ``a massive runup in London,'' said James Steel, a metals
analysts with Refco Inc. in New York.
   The market was further supported by reports of declining
warehouse stocks of copper and by production problems in Zambia,
analysts said.
   Bette Raptopoulos, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., also cited a report that Peruvian miners have threatened to
strike Monday at a small state-owned mine and a large Peruvian
copper refinery.
   Meanwhile, a strike at Asarco Inc.'s Ray copper mine in Arizona
stretched into its 11th day Wednesday, adding another bullish
factor.
   In precious-metal trading on the Commodity Exchange, gold
futures settled $1.50 to $1.70 lower with August at $355.60 a troy
ounce; silver futures ended 2 cents to 2.5 cents higher with July
at $4.836 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures prices retreated on the Chicago Board
of Trade as some analysts increased their corn and soybean
production forecasts in light of beneficial crop weather in the
Midwest.
   Last week, for example, market analysts were projecting a U.S.
corn crop of 7.6 billion to 7.7 billion bushels.
   But by Wednesday some observers were predicting a corn harvest
of as much as 8.3 billion bushels, said William Biedermann,
research director with the commodities brokerage Allendale Inc. in
Crystal Lake, Ill.
   ``Those kind of numbers scared speculators out of the
marketplace,'' he said.
   A National Weather Service forecast released after the close
predicted seasonal temperatures and normal to above-normal rainfall
in the Midwest during the latter half of next week.
   Wheat futures prices settled unchanged to 3 cents lower with
July at $3.05{ a bushel; corn was 3\ cents to 4{ cents lower with
July at $2.79} a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 5 cents lower with
July at $1.25{ a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 10 cents lower
with July at $6.09{ a bushel.
   Petroleum futures ended higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, boosted by an OPEC resolve to rein in production, a
favorable report on energy stocks and rumor of earthquake damage to
Alaska oil installations, traders said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 31 cents to 53 cents
higher with August at $17.47 a barrel; heating oil was 1.1 cents to
1.22 cents higher with August at 50.38 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .24 cent to 1.13 cents higher with August at 58.10
cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures settled
.05 cent to .25 cent higher with August at 74.20 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August at
85.42 cents a pound; live hogs were .57 cent lower to .43 cent
higher with July at 60.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
1.85 cents lower to .25 cent higher with July at 50.65 cents a
pound.

<TEXT>
   The Federal National Mortgage Association, the
nation's largest investor in home mortgages, said Wednesday its
income rose in the second quarter, largely due to a drop in
foreclosures.
   Fannie Mae reported second-quarter earnings of $289.6 million,
or $1.10 a share, compared with $193 million, or 75 cents a share,
a year earlier.
   ``This was a very successful quarter,'' said David O. Maxwell,
Fannie Mae's chairman and chief executive officer. ``Continued
strength in Fannie Mae's portfolio and mortgage-backed securities
business helped generate our 10th consecutive quarter of record
earnings.''
   For the first six months of 1990, the federally chartered
corporation reported income of $566.2 million, up from $358.2
million for the same period in 1989.
   That increase is mostly due to a $2.1 billion increase in its
average investment balance, a 4 basis point rise in net interest
margin and an $8.3 million rise in mortgage-backed security
guaranty fees, said Fannie Mae President and Chief Operating
Officer Roger Birk.
   In addition, the number of foreclosures was greatly reduced, to
the level of those in 1984, the officials said. The company said it
foreclosed on 2,315 properties in the second quarter, down from
2,997 in the second quarter of 1989 and 2,455 in first quarter 1990.

<HEAD>Mulheren Jury Continues Deliberations After Partial Verdict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury on Wednesday resumed deliberations over
26 felony counts against former Wall Street trader John A. Mulheren
Jr.
   The panel recessed in the afternoon without reaching verdicts on
the counts.
   The deliberations followed Tuesday's partial verdict in which
Mulheren was convicted of conspiracy and stock manipulation for his
dealings with admitted insider trader Ivan F. Boesky.
   The outstanding charges are allegations that Mulheren secretly
held large blocks of stock to help Boesky evade taxes and federal
securities disclosure laws.
   On Wednesday, the jury reheard testimony about these
transactions.
   The jurors are considering 26 counts of securities fraud, mail
fraud and record keeping violations, which each carry up to five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   The panel convicted Mulheren, 41, on four counts of conspiracy
and securities fraud, which carry the same penalty.
   Co-defendant Leonard DeStefano, 34, a former trader at
Mulheren's defunct firm Jamie Securities, was acquitted Tuesday of
all conspiracy and record-keeping violations charges brought
against him.

   Striking GTE Northwest telephone workers
in Northern California, Oregon and Washington narrowly approved a
new contract, ending a 19-day walkout, a union spokeswoman said.
   Tuesday's vote was 1,382 in favor and 1,227 against, said Barb
Hougen, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical

   The strike, which began June 22, had idled about 3,200 GTE
employees.
   Hougen said the new three-year pact includes across-the-board
wage increases of 3 percent in each of the first two years and 1.5
percent in each half of the final year.
   GTE originally offered an 8 percent increase over three years
plus a $270 signing bonus, but in the final contract eliminated the
bonus and added 1 percentage point to the wage package.
   Hougen said the union remained disappointed with the deal.
   ``We certainly feel that our membership is worth more in dollars

deserve to be paid as professionals,'' she said.
   About 1,300 GTE managers maintaind telephone service during the
strike.
   GTE Northwest employs about 5,400 people in Oregon, Washington,
Idaho and portions of Montana and Northern California. Workers in
eastern Washington, northern Idaho and western Montana are
represented by another union and were not involved in the strike.

<HEAD>Midland, Dow Have Good Chemistry _ Most of the Time</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once it was a dying lumber town in rural
Michigan, best known for the 14 bars on muddy Main Street.
   That was the Midland of the turn of the century, when a
fledgling chemical company called Dow decided to set up shop there.
   Today, the city of 37,000, about 100 miles north of Detroit,
lives and breathes Dow Chemical Co. The company provides jobs,
taxes, foundation money and an international ambience shared by few
other small Midwest cities.
   But it also spews fumes that smell faintly of solvent and
discharges treated wastewater into the local river, prompting
warnings that anglers shouldn't eat too many bottom fish.
   Nonetheless, the chemistry between Dow and Midland seems to
work. In many respects, it serves as a modern-day model for the
relationship between a city and a major employer, Midlanders say.
   ``We would perhaps be nonexistent if Dow had not come here and
established this chemical company,'' Assistant City Manager David
Wirth said.
   Dow Chemical has grown into Michigan's fourth-largest
manufacturer and a global giant since it was founded in 1897, and
it has taken Midland along for the ride.
   It all started with Herbert Henry Dow, who came to town in 1887
after getting a chemistry degree at Cleveland's Case Institute of
Technology.
   Major commerce in those days was a fading timber industry that
had surged as Chicago rebuilt after its disastrous fire of 1871.
   Dow tried something new. He began his business by drilling brine
wells and using electric charges to separate chemicals like
chlorine, bromine and sodium hydroxide, still the main ingredient
in Dow Oven Cleaner.
   ``Many of the people who came here with Dr. Dow and supported
him and started off with him became comfortably well off,'' said
Catherine Cummins, of the Midland Historical Society. ``Instead of
moving to Italy with a big boat or living in New York, many of them
are still in town.''
   Dow, with 55,500 workers worldwide, employs about a quarter of
Midland County's labor force of 35,250.
   The Michigan division of Midland serves as a research and
specialty division, producing things like latex and aspirin powder,
items that historically have withstood economic whims.
   Other Michigan cities haven't been so fortunate.
   Take the automaking town of Flint, about 50 miles south of
Midland. During the recession year of 1982, Flint's unemployment
rate averaged 21.1 percent, vs. 12.7 percent for Midland.
   Over the past 2{ years, Flint's jobless rate has seesawed
between 8.2 percent and 18.5 percent. Midland's unemployment ranged
from a high of 8.5 percent in January 1988 to 4.4 percent last
November.
   ``They're (Midland residents) really sheltered from the cyclical
sensitivity of the automotive industry,'' said Sandra St. Cyr, an
analyst for the Michigan Employment Security Commission.
   Dow also provides a tax shelter of sorts for Midland residents
by making up a quarter of the city's $1.3 billion tax base.
   Midland has at least 10 foundations endowed by Dow's founders
that pay for good schools and libraries, a busy theatrical and arts
center and a botanical garden.
   The relatively low jobless rate, coupled with the abundance of
educated Dow professionals that have become attracted to Midland's
schools and cultural activities, has helped keep the city's crime
rate low, some residents contend.
   ``I don't think there's a crack house in town,'' said Patrick
Dean, a Midland police officer since 1963 who once served as acting
police chief. ``It's been six or seven years since we had a
homicide.''
   In the FBI's Uniform Crime Report for 1988, the most recent one
released, Midland tallied 1,402 reported crimes, half the number of
several similar-sized Michigan cities.
   Despite all that Dow contributes, there are drawbacks to having
a giant chemical company in the backyard.
   A recent ranking of the nation's worst toxic polluters shows Dow
ranked No. 29 and third in Michigan behind General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co.
   The state first advised against eating fish from the
Tittabawassee River in 1978 after traces of the suspected
carcinogen dioxin were found in Dow's discharges. Greenpeace
canoeists paddled up the river in 1986 to plug Dow's outlets in
protest.
   In the late 1960s, demonstrators came to Dow's doors to protest
its manufacture of napalm jellied gasoline and defoliant Agent
Orange used in the Vietnam War.
   The company has since worked hard to portray a greener, cleaner
image.
   To cut dioxin discharges Dow installed a powerful waste-recovery
system. It also cooperates with environmental groups and
financially supports wetland preservation and recycling.
   The chemical bite to the air also seems to be growing fainter.
   ``I've lived here all my life, and let me tell you, you can't
smell anything now like you could before,'' said Dean, the Midland
police officer.
   The city has been spared serious chemical accidents, though
reminders of what could happen occur from time to time.
   Chlorine gas escaped a decade ago, sending emergency personnel
scrambling. Last year, three chemical tank cars derailed and
burned, sending billows of toxic smoke over nearby Freeland, where
3,000 residents were evacuated for a week.
   Nonetheless, Midland and its neighbors have also savored the
international flavor produced by Dow.
   ``People are more involved in the world ... (since) Dow has
facilities all over the world,'' said Gordon Britton, editor of
Midland Daily News.
   ``World Cup soccer is a non-event'' in many communities, said
Frank Popoff, Dow's president and chief executive officer, but not
in Midland.
   ``People here think that footballs are round with black spots on
them. You should kick them a lot. And not these elongated things.''

   The government is recovering misspent funds
from the officers and directors of failed savings institutions and
banks at a rate better than $1 million a day, a top regulator said
Wednesday.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., said his agency was investigating whether to file suit
against the officers of 1,300 failed thrifts and banks and has
already filed suit against officials of 500 institutions.
   Approximately $100 million was recovered last year and more than
$200 million in the first half of this year, he said.
   ``That is in excess of $1 million per day in recoveries'' in
1990, he said.
   President Bush'sson, Neil, could be among the defendants in a
suit. He served as a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and
Loan Association, Denver, which collapsed in December 1988 at an
estimated cost to taxpayers of $1 billion.
   Seidman, who appeared with administration officials before the
House Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice, declined to
comment on when a decision would be made on the Silverado case.
Agency officials have said they are considering a suit to recover
losses from Silverado directors.
   Administration officials have been increasingly hammered by
Democrats to demonstrate that they are doing enough to prosecute
fraud and recover S&amp;L losses. The S&amp;L problem is emerging as a hot
issue in this year's congressional races.
   The recoveries are still dwarfed by the cost of bailing out the
S&amp;L industry, estimated by the congressional General Accounting
Office to be as high as $500 billion, including interest on bailout
borrowing.
   In other savings and loan developments:
   _Seidman and Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, both promised to treat Neil Bush's case no differently
than any other S&amp;L case before them. In Houston, President Bush
repeated his promise not to interfere with regulators and said he
has had to ``calm down'' his other sons who want to ``go to the
barricades'' on Neil's behalf.
   _Documents released by the Office of Thrift Supervision show
that regulators believed Neil Bush was ``unqualified and
untrained'' for his position as director of Silverado. ``Certainly
he had no experience in managing a large corporation, especially a
financial institution with almost $2 billion in assets,'' the
documents said.
   _The Senate approved a broad crime bill that stiffens prison
terms for savings and loan fraud and offers rewards to
whistleblowers for turning in S&amp;L looters.
   _The former president of one of Texas' largest collapsed thrifts
was indicted on fraud charges in connection with a $700 million
real estate scheme. FBI officials in Dallas announced the
indictment against Edwin T. McBirney III, former president of
Sunbelt Savings Association.
   The House Judiciary panel is considering a package of reforms
designed to speed the government's anti-fraud effort. It would be
attached to a House version of the broad crime bill adopted by the
Senate.
   It would provide more money to hire investigators and attorneys
to prosecute fraud, prevent people convicted of fraud from evading
restitution by filing for bankruptcy, and allow regulators and
prosecutors to seek to freeze the assets of those accused of fraud
even before they are found guilty.
   Members of the panel sparred with Rep. Peter Smith, R-Vt., who
is sponsoring a resolution calling for the appointment of a special
prosecutor to investigate the S&amp;L scandal.
   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, called the suggestion
``McCarthyism.'' He said the appointment of an independent
prosecutor is appropriate only when allegations have been leveled
at high officials, who cannot be prosecuted without conflict by the
attorney general.
   Smith acknowledged he had no reason to suspect anyone in
particular, but said the standard method of government prosecution
was not working.
   James G. Richmond, the Justice Department's newly appointed
special counsel for financial institutions, said the department had
no position on the resolution.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee,
acknowledged the S&amp;L issue had become politicized. But, he said,
``if the flames of partisan passions lit a fire under the
administration to prosecute S&amp;L thieves, so be it.''
   Said Richmond: ``We are acutely aware that the American people
want the savings and loan wrongdoers swiftly and appropriately
punished. We do, too.''
   Seidman said fraud has been discovered in about half of the 460
S&amp;Ls seized by the government since February 1989. In 40 percent of
the institutions, fraud contributed significantly to a thrift
failure, he said.
   ``Many were owned or dominated by one individual and operated
more like real estate development organizations, investment banks,
or mutual funds than thrift institutions,'' he said. ``This
situation allows for abuse and lack of control.''

   The United States found last-minute common ground
with its summit partners Wednesday on a contentious farm subsidies
dispute, hoping to give a push to long-running efforts to overhaul
the world trading system.
   The compromise allowed President Bush to claim success on his
top summit priority: progress toward eliminating the subsidies that
he says skew world trade as well as costing taxpayers and consumers
billions of dollars in government spending and higher food prices.
   However, the European Community, America's chief antagonist on
the issue, claimed victory as well, leaving the ultimate outcome of
separate, four-year-old international trade negotiations still very
much in doubt.
   Even if the United States does persuade European governments to
lower their farm payments, Bush would still have to take on
well-entrenched farm interests to dismantle the U.S. farm support
program.
   Bush told reporters at a news conference that he was committed
to push Congress for reductions in U.S. subsidies, saying, ``We
have to do it. It is a two-way street'' with other nations.
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee, called the summit agreement ``encouraging''
but said it will not alter plans to maintain U.S. agriculture
subsidies as part of a five-year farm bill now before Congress.
   ``I hasten to point out that while the seven nations represented
in Houston play an important part in world trade, any final
agreement must be reached in Geneva with the participation of all
96 GATT signatory nations,'' de la Garza said.
   ``If concrete agreements are reached in Geneva, then we will
consider what changes may be necessary in our national agriculture
policy,'' he said.
   Administration officials saw the summit agreement as a European
commitment to significant across-the-board reductions in all types
of farm subsidies. Officials of the European Community interpreted
the final document as more general than that.
   Commenting on the disparity of views, Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney said that it pointed to a long, hard bargaining
process ahead.
   ``I'm not under any illusions that we'll be dealing with a new
era by Christmas or even by next spring,'' he said.
   But British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was more upbeat,
saying she believed the trade outcome would map a new route to
prosperity.
   ``Coming after last week's very successful NATO summit, which
took a major stride towards a more peaceful world, the results of
the meeting in Houston are an important step towards a more
prosperous world for everyone,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters on condition that she
not be named, said that the summit communique represented
significant progress just in getting the European Community back to
the bargaining table.
   ``Now we have a framework within which to negotiate. We are
still very far apart in many areas, but we have a framework,'' she
said.
   The United States has been pushing since the Venice economic
summit in 1987 for a commitment to halt a global farm subsidy war
it estimates is costing $245 billion annually.
   But the European Community has resisted Bush's demand, saying it
would result in the loss of 3 million farmers' jobs.
   Bush officials fear that unless the farm dispute is resolved, it
will kill all chances for successfully completing ambitious global
trade talks known as the Uruguay Round.
   The administration is counting on those talks to lower a wide
range of trade barriers and greatly expand opportunities for
American farmers and businesses, believing this will help America's
$100-billion-plus trade deficits.
   The talks, known as the Uruguay Round for the country where they
began in 1986, face a marathon July 23 negotiating session in
Geneva to draft framework agreements in 15 separate areas,
including agriculture.
   Those agreements will then be used over the next five months to
achieve a final agreement by a December deadline for ending the
discussions.
   The economic summit involved discussions among Bush and the
leaders of Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy.
   In their final communique, the leaders declared that successful
completion of the Uruguay Round was the ``highest priority on the
international economic agenda'' and stressed ``our determination to
take the difficult political decisions necessary to achieve
far-reaching, substantial results in all areas of the Uruguay Round
by the end of this year.''
   Bush told reporters at a news conference wrapping up the
three-day summit that the leaders had committed at the end of the
lengthy debate on farm subsidies to ``maintain our personal
involvement and to exercise political leadership at every step
along the way.''
   The final language in the communique urged each nation ``to make
substantial, progressive reductions'' in the areas of export
subsidies, internal price supports and barriers to imports, the
three areas targeted by the United States.
   The Europeans had opposed singling out specific areas for
subsidy cuts, offering instead to consider all subsidies in an
aggregate total and then reduce that total.
   While U.S. negotiators contended that the compromise reached in
Houston would prohibit that, the European Community disagreed.
   They contended the final communique committed them only to
reducing the total amount of government subsidies, marking no
change from their original position.
   The communique language was sufficiently vague on this point
that both sides could point to it to support their stands.
   Bush spoke forcefully on the subject during the summit meetings,
but he faced strong resistance from European countries. The leaders
had to extend their afternoon session Tuesday for an extra 90
minutes, grappling with the farm question.
   They then dispatched lower level negotiators to work through the
night to come up with the final language.
   The Uruguay Round is being held under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a forum and agreement for
promoting freer trade.

   Fannie Mae, the secondary mortgage market
company, said Wednesday that second quarter earnings rose 50
percent, in part because of a drop in home foreclosures.
   Earnings were $289.6 million, or $1.10 per share, up from $193
million, or 75 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Fannie Mae, formally the Federal National Mortgage Association,
is a congressionally chartered but shareholder-owned company that
buys mortgages from lenders.
   It packages many mortaes into securities for resale to investors
and is responsible for financing about one of every eight home
purchases.
   Fannie Mae Chairman David O. Maxwell attributed the performance
to an increase in the margin between the interest it earns and the
interest it pays, a rise in fee income and a drop in mortgage
foreclosures.
   The company acquired 2,315 properties through foreclosure in the
second quarter, down from 2,455 in the first quarter. It was the
lowest number since 1984.

<HEAD>Banks Required To Write-Down Brazil, Argentine Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators have ordered the nation's
largest banks to write off sizable portions of loans to
economically troubled Brazil and Argentina, bankers said Wednesday.
   The order, made in letters from the Interagency Country Exposure
Review Committee, will require banks to write off an additional 20
percent of $2.9 billion in outstanding loans to Argentina and 20
percent of $11 billion in loans to Brazil.
   The writedown of Brazilian loans is the first required by
federal authorities. The move on Argentina boosts to 60 percent the
amount of loans that must be written off by the 36 affected U.S.
banks.
   Bank officials speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed the
receipt of letters in recent days from the committee, which
consists of three federal bank regulators. The committee normally
does not announce its decisions.
   The action could force some of the banks to further boost
reserves to protect against losses from nonperforming loans to
developing nations. If a bank does not have enough set aside in
reserves to cover the write-downs, the new charges could depress
earnings.
   The 20 percent write-off of Argentine debt was the third ordered
by federal authorities.
   Brazil's was considered surprising because the country has
undertaken economic reform under new president Fernando Collor de
Mello and is expected to resume negotiations this year on meeting
some bank debt obligations.
   Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding company, declined to
comment on the regulatory action. But it said the bank already had
written down 60 percent of its Argentine exposure from a $1 billion
reserve created last year.
   ``Any other such writedowns, voluntary or mandated, would
likewise be charged to the reserve without earnings impact,'' the
statement said.
   ``That's the reason for taking such provisions and reserves,''
Citicorp said. ``The earnings impact occurs when they are taken,
not when a writedown subsequently occurs.''
   Citicorp would be forced to write off $660 million of its $3.3
billion exposure to Brazilian loans under the new mandate,
officials said. It would not have to take further writedowns
against its current $400 million exposure to Argentine loans.

   Public Service Co. of New Mexico said
Wednesday it is reviewing a tentative proposal from Wheeler Capital
Corp. to buy the New Mexico utility for $12 per share.
   J.B. ``Bud'' Mulcock Jr., PNM's senior vice president of
corporate affairs and secretary, described the proposal as a
preliminary expression of interest concerning a possible business
combination.
   ``Wheeler Peak has not submitted a formal proposal but has
suggested a possible transaction in which PNM shareholders would
receive $12 per share in cash and a portion of the common equity of
the surviving company,'' Mulcock said in a prepared statement
released by PNM.
   PNM had 41.8 million shares of common stock outstanding as of
Dec. 31, which would make the deal worth about $500 million in cash
if all shares were bought at the current price.
   PNM stock closed at $11.75 Wednesday, up from Tuesday's close of
$9.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Mulcock said the company was conducting a preliminary review of
the Wheeler Peak ``expression of interest, as part of PNM's
previously announced review of strategic options for maximizing
shareholder value.''
   Southwestern Public Service Co. said in a statement it had held
preliminary discussions with Wheeler Peak and was interested in
acquiring some of PNM's electric utility assets. It said no
agrement had been reached.
   Southwestern Public, based in Amarillo, Texas, serves customers
in parts of New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas.
   PNM had operating revenues in 1989 of $915.3 million, spokesman
Gayland Bryant said. He said the company has about 290,000 electric
customers in 25 communities around the state; its Gas Company of
New Mexico serves almost all of New Mexico.
   PNM has been experiencing financial problems. In the past three
years, its stock has fallen to nearly one-fourth of its former
value, dividends have been suspended and the company's bond rating
has been downgraded.
   PNM announced this spring that it had hired the investment
banking firm of Morgan Stanley to investigate ways in which it
could improve its return to shareholders, including the option of
selling the entire company.

   About 300 Teamsters union members rallied outside
Pan Am offices Wednesday to protest what they claim is an
inadequate contract offer by the airline.
   As employees left work throughout the afternoon, Pan Am
management locked the doors behind them. The rally took place at
the airline's offices near Miami International Airport.
   ``We're legal to strike,'' said Joyce Hardy, business
representative of the Teamsters Local 769. ``But we don't want to
be another Eastern.''
   Eastern Airlines has struggled to regain passengers since a
strike by Machinists in March 1989 that helped push the airline
into bankruptcy court. Machinists continued picketing Wednesday
down the street from the Pan Am demonstration.
   The Teamsters, representing reservations, ticket, computer and
cargo agents, have been working under company-imposed conditions
for two years since federal mediation failed.
   Union members have been working without a contract since Feb.
21, 1988.
   ``We're making our statement that we're unhappy,'' said Connie
Bach, a reservations agent at Pan Am for 17 years.
   Members criticized the company's offer of a 4 percent wage
increase. Ms. Hardy said union members agreed to $250 million in
concessions two years ago, including an 8 percent salary giveback.
   Union members said they have not had a raise since 1979. They
also have complained of having no sick days, vacation days or a
pension plan.
   Pan Am spokeswoman Elizabeth Hlinko in New York said the
Teamsters were negotiating with the company. ``We do have a
proposal on the table that offers employees a significant
improvement over their imposed contract, and we're hopeful that a
settlement will be reached soon,'' she said.

<HEAD>Two Convicted Traders Suspended From Merc</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday
suspended two traders convicted by a federal jury this week of
trading violations in the Swiss franc futures pit.
   The exchange's board of governors charged Robert D. Mosky and
Danny L. Scheck with violating Merc rules that could result in
expulsions and $275,000 in fines, exchange spokesman Andrew Yemma
said.
   The two were accused of committing ``an act which is
substantially detrimental to the interest or welfare of the
exchange'' and ``conduct which has a manifest tendency to impair
the dignity or good name of the exchange.'' A hearing is to
conducted by the exchange board at a date to be set later. Pending
the hearing Mosky and Scheck have been prohibited from conducting
customer business at the exchange, Yemma said in a statement.
   A federal jury on Monday convicted Mosky, a floor broker, of
seven felony counts, and Scheck, an independent trader, of one
count stemming from an FBI sting operation at the exchange.
   But jurors were unable to reach verdicts on 86 counts against
the two and a third defendant, independent trader David Zatz.
Prosecutors said they plan to refile the charges.
