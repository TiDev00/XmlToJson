   The campaign trail leads to city pavement in 1991, when Chicago,
Philadelphia and several other of the nation's largest cities will
be electing mayors.
   Four states will be electing governors, including one - Arizona
- that tried but failed to pick one in 1990. Among the others are
Louisiana, where gubernatorial politics is a blood sport, and
Kentucky, where Gov. Wallace Wilkinson hopes to be succeeded by his
wife.
   There are no congressional elections scheduled, and political
activity in many states is confined to minor municipal or court
races. Nationally, political insiders will be laying strategy for
the 1992 presidential race and scouting the field of potential
Democratic contenders.
   In Chicago, Mayor Richard M. Daley will try to win his first
full term in office after serving out the last two years of the
term of Mayor Harold Washington, who died in office.
   Daley's announced opponents in the Feb. 26 Democratic primary
include former Mayor Jane Byrne, a three-time electoral loser since
serving as mayor from 1979 to 1983. Byrne has been accusing Daley
of displaying a lack of leadership in the mayor's office, but polls
suggest that most voters disagree.
   In Philadelphia, two-term Mayor W. Wilson Goode is barred by law
from seeking a third consecutive term. That may be a good thing for
him, given the city's fiscal condition.
   A half-dozen candidates are already vying for the opportunity to
lead the nation's fifth largest city away from the brink of
bankruptcy. Philadelphia is counting on $150 million in emergency
short-term loans from city banks and two public employee pension
boards to stay afloat for the time being.
   The best-known candidate so far is former two-term Mayor Frank
Rizzo, a tough-talking former police officer who is running as a
Republican.
   Four Democrats are expected to be in the running, including
former District Attorney Edward Rendell, who lost to Goode in the
1987 primary and also failed in a 1986 try for governor. Also
running is former City Councilman George Burrell, who played
football for the Denver Broncos.
   Denver's mayoral race was thrown wide open last month when
two-term Mayor Federico Pena made a surprise announcement that he
wouldn't seek re-election. City Auditor Wellington Webb is the only
announced candidate so far, but several others are edging toward
the ring.
   There also will be a new mayor in Kansas City, Mo., where
recently imposed term limits bar Mayor Richard Berkley from seeking
re-election, and in Nashville, Tenn., where Mayor Bill Boner has
been the butt of jokes over his affair with and subsequent marriage
to singer Traci Peel.
   The mayor of Memphis, Tenn., Richard Hackett, is expected to
seek a third term. He may get a challenge from Rep. Harold Ford,
Tennessee's only black member of Congress.
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos is expected to seek a second term,
and already has announced opposition from county Supervisor Tom
Hsieh. In Baltimore, Mayor Kurt Schmoke is expected to run again.
   In Columbus, Ohio, Mayor Dana Rinehart plans to run for a third
term despite revelations that he had an extramarital affair with a
member of his Cabinet.
   Several mayors have yet to announce their plans, among them Salt
Lake City Mayor Palmer DePaulis and Indianapolis Mayor William H.
Hudnut III.
   Las Vegas Mayor Ron Lurie is in the off-again, on-again
category. He said he wouldn't seek re-election and then said he
might.
   In Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles, minorities hope to make
gains following lawsuits that challenged electoral district
boundaries.
   The Chicago and Dallas cases are still pending, but Hispanic
groups have won their fight in Los Angeles, where a federal judge
redrew one district on the powerful county Board of Supervisors. A
special election Jan. 22 is expected to result in the election of
the first Hispanic member of the board.
   Arizona voters will try to settle their governor's race Jan. 26
in a runoff between Republican J. Fife Symington and Democrat Terry
Goddard. Symington received about 4,000 votes more than Goddard in
the November general election, not enough for the majority needed
to win.
   Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer intends to run for another term and
may face a challenge from former Gov. Edwin Edwards, the fellow
Democrat whom Roemer ousted in 1987. Former Ku Klux Klan leader
David Duke, now a state representative, has said he will seek the
Republican nomination.
   Kentucky's governor is barred by law from seeking a second term,
so his wife, Martha Wilkinson, is running in his place. Her
opponents for the Democratic nomination include her husband's
archrival, Lt. Gov. Brereton Jones. Republican hopes seem pinned on
U.S. Rep. Larry Hopkins, who hasn't announced whether he'll run.
   Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus will try to do what no other
Mississippi governor has done this century - win a second
consecutive term. His main competition is expected to come from a
fellow Democrat, former U.S. Rep. Wayne Dowdy.
   Finally, in Corpus Christi, Texas, a hotbed of anti-abortion
activity, voters will decide on Jan. 19 whether to pass a city
charter amendment declaring that human life begins at conception.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winning the Olympics alone would have given
Atlanta reason to crow this year. But then the heavyweight
championship? And what about landing a Super Bowl? And a spot on
the ``most liveable'' list? And now - grits meets glitz! - Jane
Fonda, too?
   This city's triumphs finally gave substance to its boosters' old
nickname. In 1990, it was ``Hotlanta,'' indeed.
   True, the Olympics fireworks burst over a city that would pass a
curfew to save its children from drug dealers. True, the mayor had
to challenge preliminary census figures indicating his city was
losing people.
   But even if the ticker tape snowed on a cooling economy and on
troubles common to urban area, Atlanta celebrated as it hadn't
since the curtain went up on ``Gone With the Wind'' half a century
ago.
   In September, a few months after being picked as the site of pro
football's 1994 Super Bowl, dark horse Atlanta beat out Athens,
Greece, as host for the 1996 summer Olympic games. The confetti was
barely swept up when hometowner Evander Holyfield brought boxing's
heavyweight title to the city tagged Losersville for its sorry
teams.
   Billboards around the nation's 13th largest metropolitan area
saluted hard work and chutzpah. Headlines hollered, ``It's
Atlanta!'' On sidewalks and in grocery lines, natives beamed.
   At the Atlanta Historical Society, executive director John Ott
didn't know of another time when two parades had streamed down
Peachtree Street within six weeks.
   ``It may make Atlantans like Texans: you know, `We're the best,
we're the greatest, we're the biggest,''' he said. ``We do have the
sense that we have the wherewithal to capture things.''
   ``A City of Dreams,'' proclaimed Atlanta magazine - profiling
its own parade of locals who realized grand visions, from Martin
Luther King Jr. to Ted Turner.
   The latter's Atlanta-based Cable News Network, which many credit
with raising the city's profile, marked its 10th anniversary in
1990. And in December, Ted and Jane (Fonda, that is), whose causes
and caresses filled the daily people columns, announced their
engagement.
   Along the way, there were high marks for Atlanta from arbiters
as different as the Population Crisis Committee (tied for second
highest score on list of world's most liveable cities) and the
Fortune Industrial Survey (first among executives' likely picks for
future plant sites).
   Only three U.S. cities attract more conventioneers, and
Atlanta's high profile this year will only enhance that, said John
Jackson, vice president of the Atlanta Convention and Visitors
Bureau.
   ``A few years ago I was in London ... and a gentleman told me we
needed to get our boardwalks fixed. People associated Atlanta with
Atlantic City,'' Jackson said. ``That's not going to happen
anymore. Atlanta is on the world map.''
   The 1988 Democratic National Convention provided a smaller-scale
dress rehearsal for events the city is now committed to staging, he
said, adding that Atlanta managed the attention well then. Some
15,000 reporters descended on the city and ``95 percent or more of
the stories were positive.''
   In 1989, however, Atlanta led the nation's large cities in
serious crime, according to FBI statistics. Even though the city
has shed that dubious distinction as crime figures declined this
year, some reporters continue to cite it, said Angelo Fuster, press
secretary for Mayor Maynard Jackson. ``It's terribly frustrating,''
he said.
   In November, the City Council restored a curfew for children 16
and under that hadn't been in effect in nearly a decade, prompted
earlier by the so-called ``Atlanta child murders'' cases. In
calling for a new curfew, a sponsor cited killings in her district,
including that of a 4-year-old girl.
   Civil libertarians doubted the curfew was constitutional, but
the mayor said it would ``help us fight drugs and protect our
children.''
   City Hall damage controllers went to work after preliminary
figures from the U.S. Census Bureau said Atlanta's population fell
from 425,000 to 384,000 between 1980 and 1990. The city, contending
it had grown to 437,000, said census takers overlooked many, and
undercounted others. It demanded a recount.
   Cracks even began to show in the smiling facade of unanimity
that helped win the Olympics. Residents near the proposed sites of
certain venues protested that their neighborhoods would suffer.
   Some activists worried that officials would try to sweep
lingering problems like homelessness from visitors' view, rather
than working to solve them.
   ``There are blighted neighborhoods in the path of stadiums all
over Atlanta that are going to have to be gentrified,'' complained
Anita Beaty, director of the cty's Task Force for the Homeless,
which counted 47,000 individuals who sought emergency housing last
year.
   Ms. Beaty said she's concerned that money which could go toward
shelter and other needs will instead be used for superficial
beautification. She called for more public involvement in planning.
   ``I'm no longer saying we don't want the Olympics. That's
useless,'' she said. ``I'm saying how can we benefit? ... How can
we manage the impact?''
   The Super Bowl and the Olympics are new chapters in an old story
of self-promotion and courting outsiders that has helped define the
city that grew from a railroad terminus. Torched by Gen. William T.
Sherman in the Civil War, Atlanta adopted the motto, ``Resurgens,''
Latin for ``rising again,'' and never forgot that goal.
   After the Civil War, Atlanta editor and orator Henry Grady
trumpeted a ``New South'' - ``less splendid on the surface but
stronger at the core - a hundred farms for every plantation ... and
a diversified industry that meets the needs of this complex age.''
   Northerners liked what they heard, and Yankee investment poured
in to the New South's capital.
   That typifies Atlanta's style - ``welcome anybody, particularly
if they've got a few dollars,'' said Jack Spalding, former editor
of The Atlanta Journal.
   ``People say, `The Olympics? Good God, how can you handle it?'
'' Spalding said. But he cited precedents, notably a civic showcase
mounted just three decades after Sherman's destruction: the 1895
Cotton States and International Exposition. It attracted 800,000
people, nearly 10 times the city's population.
   Other than to get attention, ``there was absolutely no
justification for it,'' Spalding said, a smile wrinkling his eyes.
``Atlanta's always had a lot of imagination.''

   ``In this country, there aren't
enough white people to handle all the managerial positions,''
Johann Haasbroek said. ``You have to use people of other
cultures.''
   Driving a pickup over bumpy trails cut through maize and wheat
fields northwest of Johannesburg, the 57-year-old farmer explained
why he began promoting black workers more than a decade ago.
   Such radical action was considered suicidal in the right-wing
world of South African farming, but it worked for Haasbroek, who
runs a successful family farm and is setting up another for his
son.
   He employs five whites and ``about 60 or 70'' full-time blacks
at the main farm. Some of the black workers hire seasonal work
crews and manage specific areas of the operation.
   ``When I was young, you'd very seldom get a black man who wanted
to be a foreman,'' Haasbroek said. ``There was a lot of
superstition, more than now, among the blacks. They thought
something would happen to them.''
   Then need and ambition combined, and ``about 12 years ago, one
of my black workers said he was willing to train as a foreman,'' he
said. When pressed, the farmer acknowledged encouraging the man.
   ``I said, `You know it would be much easier if I could have one
of you guys as foreman; it would take a lot of responsibility off
my hands','' he recalled.
   New responsibilities led to new commitment on both sides,
Haasbroek said. Workers displayed a better attitude, he said, and
he let them open a school for their children on the farm.
   Some of the workers attended courses on farm management at
government training centers, at their employer's expense.
   ``They give the basics of how it should be done, not only seen
from a job point of view, but communication among themselves and
other things,'' he said of the training centers.
   The result of it all, in Haasbroek's view, is a stable group of
workers who take pride in the farm.
   ``I'd never say it was expressed in words, but in their way of
doing things, taking responsibility and doing it for themselves,
they're all very proud of the farm,'' he said.
   ``For instance, we have two soccer teams. They always want to
win. They're very proud of the team.''
   People are like trees, Haasbroek said, with some growing taller
and straighter than others.
   ``The big thing is to be able to identify the bloke who can do
it,'' he said. ``There's a lot of potential in these people waiting
to be developed.''

   For Stan Edmister, bridges are a canvas. Where
an engineer sees a mass of concrete and steel, he sees a potential
masterpiece.
   ``If paint is going to be put on a bridge to sustain its life,
why should it be brown or gray or pastel green, when it could be a
lively combination of colors?'' says the 51-year-old artist.
   Two years ago, Edmister won a $10,000 grant from the National
Endowment for the Arts to design a color scheme for the Guilford
Avenue bridge in Baltimore. The result was so pleasing, one NEA
official said, that Edmister was awarded a second $10,000 grant to
select colors for 15 other bridges that cross Interstate 83.
   As the bridges are rehabilitated, they will be painted according
to Edmister's design.
   Jeff Soule, special project manager at the NEA in Washington,
said the award committee hopes Edmister's work will spur other
cities to treat their public works as art.
   ``We felt it would be a national model in improving the
appearance of ordinary structural elements in the urban
environment. It is a very, very pragmatic application of art. It
elevates public works and at the same time, it makes art
accessible,'' Soule said.
   He's uncomfortable with muted hues that allow behemoths to
settle anonymously into the background. So he experiments with
vibrant greens, yellows, oranges and foil appliques that change
color.
   He selects colors to highlight the design of a bridge and its
setting, he says.
   He wants to treat the bridges over Interstate 83 as a continuum
- related, yet each with its own temperament.
   ``Driving under and through the city, there is a series of
tunnel arches or bridge covers that sets up a natural rhythm. There
should be some sort of color theme uniting them, but there should
not be a bland blanket similarity from one to another,'' he said.
   The arches of the Guilford Avenue bridge are bright green, gray
and henna. Vertical yellow bands link arch to deck. Girders on the
underside are green and yellow. Iridescent green stripes along the
bridge's gray fence appear to change color when the sun strikes
them.
   The painting was part of a $3.8 million bridge rehabilitation.
City officials say they don't know whether the special treatment
cost more than if a single color had been used. Harry McCullough,
chief of Baltimore's interstate bridge division, said the city
sought just one contract and didn't seek a comparison bid.
   The cost of cleaning and painting the bridge was $137,000, well
below the engineer's estimate of $210,000, he said.
   The federal government provided 85 percent of the rehabilitation
money. Porter Barrows, division administrator of the Federal
Highway Administration in Maryland, said the government allowed the
special painting after determining the additional cost would be
minimal.
   ``I don't want to say that the cost isn't important, because it
is,'' he said. ``But we felt the proposal was legitimate and
interesting. It resulted in some interesting comments, I think.''
   The federal government must approve Edmister's colors, which
include the vibrant green used for road signs and the bright yellow
used for center lines. Foils must be used in moderation. The
government toned down Edmister's initial idea for the Guilford
Avenue bridge, fearing it would be too distracting to motorists.
   Not everyone approves of his concepts, Edmister said, although
the Guilford bridge has converted some skeptics.
   ``I remember a few engineers who said they disliked an artist
tampering in their arena and certainly didn't like a carnival-like
color scheme being used,'' he said. ``Now that the bridge is done,
and the newness is starting to settle in, or the familiarity is
becoming apparent, these same engineers are accepting it.''

<HEAD>For Combat Pilots, What Counts Is Scorecard on Perfect Landings</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For combat pilots on the
carrier USS John F. Kennedy, what counts most is the large
``greenie'' scoreboard in every squadron that shows who landed
perfectly and who didn't.
   ``The thing that scares us most, even more than flying in combat
and dying really, is the fear of failing in the eyes of fellow
pilots or ourselves,'' said Navy Lt. Wes Huey, 25, of Pensacola,
Fla., who's been an F-14 pilot for just more than two months.
   In the elite circle of combat aviators, there is no greater
skill than a perfect carrier landing - catching the third of four
wires stretched across a rolling, pitching deck with a hook under
the tail of an F-14 interceptor or A-7 light-attack aircraft.
   To do it on a moonless night is the pinnacle of precision flying
``with no exaggeration,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Val Diers, 33, of Norman,
Okla., who's mainly been flying A-7s for 12 years.
   On carriers like the 82,000-ton Kennedy, whose key feature is
its compact runway - which is always moving with the ship - a bad
landing can spell disaster. Hence, there is a premium on
perfection.
   The ``greenie'' boards hold a prominent position in the ready
rooms of every squadron where pilots gather and wait for their next
takeoff. The boards not only record the quality of every landing
but promote the competitive edge crucial for combat aviators.
   ``That's how we grade ourselves,'' Diers said. ``Each landing is
critiqued and it's a big deal for a Navy pilot.''
   Every time a landing cycle starts on the carrier, pilots from
each squadron stand on the side of the flight deck, guiding their
planes in and grading the landings, which can be watched on
television.
   Slowing down from several hundred miles an hour to catch the No.
3 wire and come to a complete stop in seconds gets a big green mark
on the board.
   An average landing, slightly short on the No. 2 wire or too long
on the No. 4, gets a yellow mark. An orange or red mark means a
safe but below-average landing.
   A white mark with a large B in it means a ``bolter,'' missing
all four wires and having to try again. Uusually, it's the newer
pilots who miss.
   As Diers looked at the board on the back wall of his A-7
squadron, VA-46, he pointed with pride to the large field of green,
with a scattering of yellows and reds and just a few whites.
   ``Most of them hit that target wire - they're that good,'' he
said.
   There is stiff competition between the junior and senior pilots
in Huey's F-14 squadron, VF-32, and its board had a similar emerald
hue.
   ``It's all just a competitive experience from the minute you
wake up to the minute you go to bed,'' said Huey, a graduate of the
U.S. Naval Academy. His father was an F-4 pilot.
   ``Where else in the world do you find people berating their
fellow workers with things they've done wrong, but in the fighter
pilot profession?'' he asked.
   ``It's all sort of a stress test that we go through when we're
not actually out there flying in the arena where stress is the way
of life. We sort of try to bring that into our daily routine, so
that it's not such a shock when we do get into combat,'' he said.
   Like Huey, many pilots on the Kennedy said they're ready for war
with Iraq but hope for a peaceful solution.
   Lt. Dan Turner, 29, of Jacksonville, Fla., said he hoped he'd
never have to use the laser-guided bombs or anti-radiation missiles
on his A-7.
   ``By being out here, hopefully we're providing the punch to make
him pull back,'' he said of Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   Lt. Timothy J. Naughton, 27, of Sheldon, Iowa, an A-7 pilot like
his father - who is now NASA's chief of operations at the Johnson
Space Center - said ``no one ever wants to go to war.''
   ``It's always fun to drop bombs ... if you know there's no one
around and no one shoots back at you. But no one wants to get shot
at,'' he said.

   In 1968, college student Dan Blue wanted to
leave the farm and become a scientist. But the assassinations of
Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy sent him in a new
direction.
   Next month, he is in line to become North Carolina's first black
House speaker.
   Blue was nominated unanimously Dec. 7 by Democrats for the key
legislative post. His nomination followed the defeat of another
black Democrat, former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt, in a bitter
and racially divisive U.S. Senate campaign against Jesse Helms.
   Blue says the two events were not linked; even before the
election, he already had commitments from House colleagues to vote
for him. The fact that they belived they could do so without
backlash from constituents, is ``saying a tremendous amount about
North Carolina, I believe.''
   Because Democrats control 81 of the 120 seats in the House, Blue
is virtually assured election when the General Assembly convenes
Jan. 30. Blue, 41, would be the first black speaker of the House in
North Carolina and the nation's fourth, assuming history didn't
lose track of any during Reconstruction.
   Blue won his first term in the state House in 1980. He has
served as chairman of the legislative black caucus and sponsored
the law declaring King's birthday a state holiday.
   He was active in the Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis campaigns
in 1988. Blue also was instrumental in changing the state's
election laws last year to require 40 percent of the votes to win a
primary, rather than a 50 percent threshold that had been a barrier
to black candidates.
   Blue grew up on a family farm in Robeson County, where the
population is divided almost evenly among blacks, whites and
Indians. Despite the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision outlawing
school segregation, Blue was bused across the county to a black
school.
   He arrived at predominantly black North Carolina Central
University in Durham during the upheavals over civil rights and
Vietnam.
   ``There were the meetings at various churches, or just meeting
houses, where young black students and young white students got
together,'' he said. ``You developed an activist-type attitude. You
simply couldn't be in Durham back in the mid-'60s without it
infecting you to some degree.''
   Blue was attracted by the role lawyers played in the movement.
   ``They had a direct understanding of the system, knowing that
they had an obligation to make it work, to make the overall society
better.''
   ``All of us followed Martin Luther King,'' Blue said. ``I guess
my decision to go to law school was firmly fixed after he was
assassinated, with the King-Kennedy assassinations.''
   But first, Blue completed his degrees in math and chemistry,
because ``you don't quit once you've embarked on a course.''
   He had decided to become a scientist after television reports on
the first satellite, Sputnik, launched by the Soviets in 1957.
   ``I remember distinctly all the news stories with Douglas
Edwards and all of those folk on Sputnik and how we were really
making a push for science and all of that,'' he said. ``I just had
it fixed in my head from the time that I was in second or third
grade that I was supposed to become a scientist of some sort.''
   After graduating from Duke University's law school, Blue went to
work at a Raleigh law firm that included Terry Sanford, a
Democratic former governor who is now a U.S. senator.
   Blue's first foray into politics, as an 11-year-old, was nailing
up Sanford campaign signs in 1960.
   In 1991, the major issue facing the state House is a projected
budget shortfall of more than $1 billion.
   ``There are more challenges when there are tough issues you've
got to face, but the rewards are certainly much greater, too,''
Blue said.
   ``My thing is that we steer this state on a sound course ... so
that we truly do become that progressive beacon that folk from off
a distance say we are, and that I'd like to believe we are,'' he
said.

<HEAD>This New Year's Eve is Literally Once in Blue Moon</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Year's Eve will bring a
once-in-a-blue-moon event: a blue moon. Witches and scientists have
varying opinions on its importance.
   ``I think it will be a great night for parties. They'll be wild
parties,'' said astrologer and Tarot reader Tom Jerome Roma of
suburban Woodlyn.
   Derrick Pitts, an astronomer at the Franklin Institute, laughed
at the idea of the second full moon in a month having some special
effect on human affairs.
   ``It's definitely good luck. Everybody should spend at least two
minutes in the moonlight so you can get bathed in all that
moonlight,'' he said with a chuckle. ``No, there's no real
significance.''
   A full moon comes every 29{ days, when the Earth's natural
satellite is opposite the sun in the sky, so any month but February
could see two full moons, the second appearance known as a blue
moon.
   Actually, a blue moon occurs about every 32 months. The moon,
when the weather conditions are just right, can also appear blue in
color. But the expression ``once in a blue moon'' came from two
moons in a calendar month.
   The last blue moon was on May 31, 1988; the next one will be
Sept. 30, 1993. The last blue moon on New Year's Eve was in 1971.
   The alignment of the Earth, moon and sun will mean stronger
tides. But Roma insists that the lineup of heavenly bodies will
exert a pull on people, too.
   ``The full moon is really the moon opposite the sun,'' he said.
``To confront that emotional energy twice in a month is
difficult,'' he said, especially during the holidays.
   Ann Duckworth, a witch who operates the Hand of Aries store in
Philadelphia, pointed out that Dec. 2 saw the full moon closer to
the Earth than it's been in 60 years. This one will be nearly as
close, she said.
   Witches believe the moon represents a female deity, she said,
and the proximity of the full moon means her influence will
increase.
   ``Most witches are hoping we will have a stronger goddess
influence on the Earth,'' she said. ``We will have more nurturing
and peace, which will help the war situation that is developing.''
   In more down-to-earth matters, emergency services director Ellen
Doyle at Crozer-Chester Medical Center said she expects trouble New
Year's Eve from the spirits that come in bottles, not the ones in
the stars.
   ``New Year's Eve can be a very busy night, and that's from 2
a.m. on,'' she said. ``Couple that with a full moon, I can
anticipate a pretty busy night. The fact many have been drinking
makes it more complex and difficult to handle. It will really be a
challenge.''

   Breast cancer surgeon Rudolph Almaraz was
considered a gifted healer who inspired trust, but his death last
month left some of his former patients frightened and feeling
betrayed.
   He had never told his hospital or his patients that he had AIDS.
   The case has embroiled Johns Hopkins Hospital, one of the
nation's most respected medical centers, in an emotionally charged
debate over the responsibility of doctors to inform patients of
their own health problems.
   Two weeks after Almaraz died, The Sun reported he had operated
on some 1,800 patients after becoming infected with the AIDS virus.
   After the story broke, Hopkins mailed letters to those former
patients and invited them to call if they had concerns. About 400
have called so far.
   ``The reaction has varied, really, from one extreme to the
other,'' said Dr. Timothy Townsend, the hospital's senior director
for medical affairs, who has taken about 100 of the calls.
   ``Some are tremendously shocked that they were not told. He was
an extremely charismatic doctor,'' Townsend said. ``Many, a large
majority, have very nice things to say about him. Many of them feel
a bewilderment and a sense of betrayal.''
   About 90 percent of the callers have indicated they will accept
Hopkins' offer to be tested for the AIDS virus.
   Hopkins doctors emphasized the slight risk of contracting the
AIDS virus during surgery.
   According to one study, a physician who is cut while operating
on an AIDS patient has a 0.2 percent chance of picking up the AIDS
virus.
   The risk of transmission the other way - from doctor to patient
- is even smaller. Of the estimated 1 million HIV-infected
Americans, only one patient is believed to have been contaminated
during medical treatment, experts say.
   Hopkins doctors say the only way Almaraz could have passed on
the AIDS virus is if he had cut himself during surgery and dripped
blood onto the patient. Hopkins knows of no such incidents
involving Almaraz.
   The case has placed Hopkins in the middle of the growing
national debate over whether doctors have a moral obligation to
inform patients if they are infected with HIV. The issue arose in
July when it was disclosed that a Florida dentist apparently passed
on the AIDS virus to one of his patients.
   ``The risk is almost zero; not zero, but almost,'' said Dr.
Hamilton Moses III, vice president for medical affairs at Hopkins.
``The question is does a patient have a right to know. That
question should best be answered in the context of the risk.''
   Even Hopkins doctors are split on an HIV-infected doctor's moral
responsibility.
   ``If the risk is zero or close to zero, then I don't think there
is a responsibility,'' Townsend said.
   ``Personally, I think the patient does have the right to know
and to make that choice,'' said Dr. Robert Heyssel, president for
medical affairs at Hopkins.
   Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said they
expect to come up with a policy next month to guide hospitals in
deciding whether HIV-infected doctors should be allowed to operate
and whether they should inform patients.
   Three lawsuits, including one for $22 million, have been filed
against the hospital and the Almaraz estate. Plaintiffs claim
mental anguish over the fear that they might get AIDS.
   Marvin Ellin, the attorney for Almaraz's widow, complained about
a Baltimore law firm's placement of advertisements offering its
services to patients operated on by HIV-infected surgeons.
Almaraz's name was not mentioned.
   Gary Strausberg of the firm of Janet and Strausberg, which
placed the advertisement, said the firm has been contacted by
several of Almaraz's former patients and lawsuits are under
consideration.
   ``A patient who is treated by a health care provider should not
be exposed to extraordinary danger. He has a right to know whether
he is being exposed to an additional risk,'' said Strausberg.
   Hopkins officials say they don't think the case will have any
long-term effect on the hospital.
   ``This is a flap that will soon pass,'' Moses predicted. ``We
will have a legacy of lawsuits. It will have some educational value
for the public and provide better data (on the risk of
doctor-to-patient transmission of HIV). But I don't think this will
have major consequences.''

   Thousands of people go to prison every
year for a myriad of frailties: hate, greed, sometimes love.
   Arthur ``Frenchy'' Cournoyer went to prison for junk - and, he
says, a principle.
   ``This is a country where a man is supposed to have a right to
earn a living. And they are supposed to have justice,'' said
Cournoyer, who has spent 32 years and about $100,000 battling
attempts to close a truck salvage yard on his property in the
northern Rhode Island town of Lincoln.
   His salvage yard was there before town zoning prohibited it,
Cournoyer said. The authorities contend he's an outlaw.
   So Cournoyer, 66, last week finished six months at the
minimum-security prison in Cranston for contempt of a judge's order
to clear his property.
   ``I believe that if I'm right I should fight to the end,'' he
said in a recent prison interview.
   It was his fifth time in prison since 1963 - a total of 287 days
behind bars, he said.
   The quiet, barrel-chested Cournoyer seemed out of place among
the mostly younger inmates. His hair was going white. A broom straw
dangled from his mouth in place of a trademark toothpick.
   ``They call me `The Legend,''' he said. ``I keep coming here,
they'll be giving me a pension pretty soon.''
   Talk about prison life evoked not much more than a verbal shrug.
   ``If a man should be in jail, he's got it made. But a man like
me that don't belong here, you know, it's still not that bad,'' he
said.
   The headlines of his continuing battle may bring sympathy. But
town officials' patience has worn thin.
   ``The fact that he's a colorful person, the fact that he's
quotable and funny ... doesn't color the basic fact that the guy
doesn't want to listen to a court edict, which to me makes him
something of an anarchist,'' Town Solicitor James Marusak said.
   Cournoyer's 32 acres are in a wooded area dotted with
split-level houses. His rocky land is now mostly clear, but
glitters with bits of broken glass from junked vehicles.
   A man who has lived across the street for 43 years was bitter
about the junkyard, saying the business has been an eyesore and a
noise nuisance.
   ``It's about time the judge done something about it,'' said the
80-year-old man, who would not give his name. He said Cournoyer had
sued him twice.
   Cournoyer's father, a carpenter who came from Canada in the
1920s, bought the land in 1946 and hoped to develop it, but it was
too rocky. Cournoyer suggested he start a salvage yard.
   Cournoyer has watched at least four times as crews have come to
haul away his junk, sometimes hundreds of cars. But he always found
more.
   ``When they cleaned me out, I started running again. That's what
burnt them up,'' Cournoyer said. ``I did make a living out of it
one way or the other. As long as I keep the yard open, I could
survive.''
   Superior Court Justice Anthony A. Giannini ordered Cournoyer
released in time for Christmas, but told him to clear a mobile
home, a half-dozen vehicles and a garage from his land by Feb. 15.
   Cournoyer said he would be content to retire, collect Social
Security, work on the restoration of a 1952 tractor truck.
   But a truce may have to wait.
   Cournoyer said he lived in the lime green '50s-style mobile
home, and it shouldn't be part of the junkyard dispute.
   ``The war is not over. ... I will make history,'' he said as he
talked about appealing to federal court, even U.S. Supreme Court.
   And if the battle stopped today - the one that has lasted
through most of his adult life and taken him to talk shows,
newspaper front pages, and courtrooms, as well as prison?
   ``I think I'd be lost. I'd be like a fish out of water,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   In the vast, rolling countryside
of the northern Transvaal, efforts to end apartheid have sown
conflict between white farmers and millions of blacks who want
land.
   The government has promised that laws prohibiting blacks from
owning property in most of the country will be scrapped next year.
   Instead of easing tension, plans to repeal the Land Acts have
illuminated the deep divisions between blacks and whites about
South Africa's future.
   ``Historical injustices resulting from land-grabbing over three
centuries cannot easily be rectified now,'' the Star newspaper said
in an editorial.
   Under the land laws, 87 percent of South Africa is reserved for
the 5 million whites, most of it agricultural land owned by fewer
than 50,000 farmers.
   The 30 million blacks can own property only in black townships
around cities and in the 10 tribal homelands on the remaining, and
worst, 13 percent of South Africa's land.
   How to undo the disparity is a contentious issues for the
government and such black opposition groups as the African National
Congress as they negotiate a new constitution that will give blacks
political power.
   To blacks, reform means reversing decades of injustice, when
laws perpetuated the white expansion that drove them from the land
of their ancestors.
   Most delegates to a recent ANC workshop on land reform approved
a statement saying, ``The state should play the principal role in
effecting a major redistribution of land.''
   Many white farmers see land reform as a leftist plot to strip
them of their God-given heritage as the proper caretakers of the
land.
   ``We feel there is no way the blacks are going to go onto our
land,'' said Bill Ruthven, a supporter of the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party.
   South Africa's Land Acts of 1913 and 1936 forced blacks with
small farms to give them up and move to homelands or work for
whites. The ANC and other anti-apartheid groups say those who lost
their land should get it back and large portions of the country
should be turned over to blacks.
   ``The existing inequitable distribution of land'' must end, said
Joanne Yawitch, coordinator of the private National Land Committee.
``In order to redress the apartheid legacy, there's going to have
to be a strong policy of affirmative action.''
   Ms. Yawitch also is an administrator of the ANC Land Commission.
   A central recommendation of the ANC workshop was a strong
government role in redistributing land, including a program of
loans and grants available to people of all races.
   President F.W. de Klerk's government has offered no formal land
policy, but said ``current title deeds of farmers and landowners
are safe.''
   The South African Development Bank, which provides government
loans for homeland developmewnt, has suggested turning over 5
million acres of state-owned land to blacks. It also recommends
that about 1,000 white farmers with heavy debts to the government
Land Bank sell their land to blacks in exchange for debt
write-offs.
   Such proposals smack of socialism to Ruthven and other white
farmers.
   Most are Afrikaners, the descendents of Dutch settlers who
dominate the government. They were raised on the doctrine that God
chose them to live in South Africa and farm the land.
   Afrikaner farmers generally believe de Klerk has betrayed his
people by seeking to share power with blacks. Some belong to
extreme right-wing groups that have organized private armies and
vowed to keep their land.
   Piet Swart, director of the all-white South African Agricultural
Union, said: ``I don't think we need any government agency going
around and telling people to whom to sell and for how much.
   ``It isn't only a question of changing land ownership; you have
to have the wealth and entrepreneurial skills. I think change is
going to come, not only in agriculture. It's going to take time. It
must take time.''
   His organization contends market forces alone should determine
who buys and sells property after the Land Acts are gone.
   Swart granted such a policy would maintain the status quo, since
few blacks would have the money to buy farmland.
   Johann Hartman of the Transvaal Agriculture Union, the most
conservative chapter of the national organization, said the debate
should focus on how best to use the land.
   ``Agricultural land should be utilized for maximum production,
to feed the people of the land and not for political purposes,'' he
said.
   Ruthven, a burly, bearded man of 53, fears the government or
independent agencies will provide loans or grants for blacks to buy
land. He also opposes affirmative action programs intended to help
blacks become farmers.
   ``For 300 years, the white people have been doing this for
blacks,'' he said. ``Now we're weaning them. We're not
breast-feeding them anymore. My nipples are sore.''

<TEXT>
   Mexico, where sun worship has passed from
ancient civilizations to modern beachgoers, is gearing up early for
the day next year when the sun will be blotted out.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has appointed a
Cabinet-level commission to prepare for what astronomers bill as
``the slar eclipse of the century'' on July 11. Posters have been
placed in Mexico City subways promoting the event, and resorts
along the eclipse's path are scrambling to accommodate the expected
rush of tourists.
   ``It's the most important eclipse in history,'' says Miguel Gil
Guzman, secretary-general of the Mexican Astronomical Society.
   This one will cut a swath across one of the most populous
regions of the globe, turning day to night for an estimated 50
million residents in 14 of Mexico's 31 states. The eclipse path
reaches from Hawaii through Mexico to Brazil.
   The 165-mile-wide path will go dark for almost seven minutes,
the maximum length for a total solar eclipse.
   On July 11, the moon will pass between the planet and the sun,
abruptly swallowing midday's light, except for a weird glow on the
horizon.
   People from British Columbia to Buenos Aires will experience at
least a partial eclipse.
   Viewing conditions may be poor because of the Latin American
rainy season.
   But the special government commission, Eclipse 1991, is banking
on the clouds to roll in the country's financial favor.
   The commission bills the northwestern state of Baja California
Sur as the best place to watch because the state has an average of
300 cloudless days a year.
   Baja California Sur alone plans to spend $26.5 million for
public safety for eclipse enthusiasts but banks on raking in
millions more from tourism.
   For three years, scientists and astronomy buffs have been
staking out turf in Mexico. It will be the last chance to see a
total solar eclipse this century.
   Most hotels along the eclipse route are full for July 11.
Tourism officials are seeking private homes and campgrounds,
schools and auditoriums to house the influx.
   Baja California Sur's tourist facilities can only handle 120,000
visitors, and 90 percent of that capacity is booked, tourism
director Rodolfo Palacios says.
   The state says at least four ships will pressed into service as
floating hotels.
   Some 13,500 amateur and professional astronomers from the United
States, Japan, Soviet Union, China, Canada, England, France and
Germany have confirmed reservations. Some tourists have been booked
into one hotel even before it is completed.
   The Pacific coast region of Nayarit is bracing for about 1
million visitors, about double the population.
   Cuernavaca, 35 miles south of Mexico City, is hosting a
geophysicists' congress during the week of the eclipse.
   At least one expedition plans to view the show from the
17,887-foot Popocapetl volcano, the country's second-highest peak.
   Others plan to see it from boats at sea.
   An eclipse is an astronomical coincidence. The moon is 400 times
smaller than the sun, but because it is 400 times closer to the
earth, the smaller body appears to cover the larger one.
   Rosy rays of light will shoot out around the moon's edges,
forming what astronomers call a corona, or crown.
   Temperatures will drop at least 5{ degrees. The stars will come
out; the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter will shine.
Streetlights will be triggered on.
   The National University is developing six half-hour
documentaries on eclipses and 10 TV spots on the dangers of looking
at the sun, astronomy professor Jesus Galindo says.
   Since September, the university newspaper has been publishing
installments of a book called ``Eclipse'' that will be translated
into Indian languages.
   The government plans to supervise the production of special
lenses for viewing an eclipse.

<HEAD>USDA Sees Opportunities for Boosting Tobacco Exports to Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel is not a big market for U.S. tobacco,
but an Agriculture Department analyst says there are opportunities
if some obstacles can be overcome.
   Laura R. Davis of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
said domestic production of Israeli tobacco declined sharply in
recent years, from a dry weight of 700 metric tons in 1985 to an
estimated 130 tons in 1990.
   But Israeli use of unmanufactured tobacco in 1990 was forecast
at 3,900 metric tons, meaning that imports of around 4,000 tons
were needed to meet the demands of Israel's cigarette industry.
   ``Cigarette consumption has been fairly stable in Israel,''
Davis said. ``Smokers represent a quarter of the population and
prefer American-style cigarettes. The recent influx of Soviet
immigrants, who are heavy smokers, may offset any gains in
anti-smoking efforts.''
   Writing in a new report on world tobacco, Davis said the United
States accounts for approximately 90 percent of Israel's annual $40
million in cigarette imports.
   Compared with the huge U.S. export trade in total, that is
hardly a puff in the wind.
   In October, for example, exports of 15,150 tons of U.S. tobacco
leaf alone were valued at $106 million. And cigarette exports in
October - 18.7 billion pieces - were worth $571 million.
   But USDA looks carefully at potential foreign markets in hopes
of adding a bit here and there to the export total.
   Israel's imports have shifted in recent years from the
unmanufactured tobacco to cigarettes. The 4,000 tons of leaf
imported in 1990 is down from nearly 7,000 tons in 1986.
   Meanwhile, cigarette imports have climbed to around 2 billion
pieces annually from 433 million in the same four-year period.
   ``The Israeli tobacco industry is monopolized by one company
(Dubek) which has roots in the domestic market for over 50 years,''
Davis said. ``This company is the major force in determining the
quantity and types of tobacco that is imported.''
   Recent increases in imports, however, have created competition
for domestic cigarettes. And Davis said the Israeli government
``would like to encourage additional competition'' for domestic
cigarette manufacturers and importers.
   Two cigarette companies attempted to enter the Israeli cigarette
industry in 1989 but failed: Potomac Cigarette Co. Ltd., which
introduced a brand named Forum; and CA Blockers of Louisville, Ky.,
which tried to introduce a smokeless cigarette.
   Davis said production of ``an established international brand
would be the most likely to succeed'' in the Israeli cigarette
market.
   ``A company that would produce cigarettes under license in
Israel and export some portion of total production would qualify
for investment incentives and tax concession,'' she said.
   Major cigarette companies have shied away from investing in
Israel for a number of reasons, Davis said. One is Israel's rigid
price controls on cigarettes; another is that the market is too
small.
   Some industry sources say a name-brand manufacturer would want a
market of at least 5 billion pieces annually, the analyst said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Australia's young and relatively high-income
population is developing into an upscale market for U.S. food
exporters, says an Agriculture Department trade report.
   The microwave oven has had a big influence, too.
   Based on 1988-89 figures, the United States had a 15 percent
share of Australia's $2.8 billion in agricultural imports,
including many high-value, prepared and fresh products.
   ``With a very young, urban and relatively wealthy population
that must turn to imports for a substantial amount of
consumer-ready products, Australia should be a market for even more
U.S. products,'' the report said.
   The United States is a major supplier of shelled almonds,
walnuts, pecans, prepared potatoes, fresh strawberries, oranges,
grapefruit and onions, as well as many other processed items.
   Some of this market is due to the different growing seasons,
with Australia in the Southern Hemisphere and the United States in
the northern.
   ``With more Australians working, increased mobility and a
greater concern for the pursuit of leisure, microwave ovens have
become the leading domestic appliance in Australia, and demand is
expanding for convenience food,'' said John E. Riesz, U.S.
agricultural counselor in Canberra.
   A recent informal survey showed products with good potential
include health foods; bran-based cereals and breads; garlic;
microwaveable foods; Mexican foods, especially frozen meals; salad
dressings; mayonnaise; snacks; confectionery products, particularly
gourmet chocolate items; and new, innovative food items.
   Riesz's report was included in the January issue of AgExporter
magazine published by USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Agriculture Department is seeking public
comments on setting up a soybean promotion, research and consumer
information program.
   Congress authorized the soybean program in the 1990 farm law,
along with similar programs for pecans, mushrooms and limes. The
programs are to be supported by assessments on producers.
   The Agricultural Marketing Service of USDA said comments on the
soybean program can be sent by Jan. 25 to: Ralph L. Tapp, Chief,
Marketing Programs Branch, Livestock and Seed Division, AMS, USDA,
Room 2624-S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, D.C. 20090-6456.

<HEAD>Government Forecasts Say Industry to Show Scant Growth in 1991</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. industry should log a ninth consecutive
year of growth in 1991, but just barely, says the government's 32nd
annual forecast of winners and losers in American business.
   The Commerce Department predicted Sunday that 110 of 184
manufacturing industries it surveyed would enjoy rising sales next
year, and the rest will suffer no growth or a drop in sales.
   The new year holds promise for high-technology and medical
companies, but a broad array of businesses tied to automobile and
housing production face dim prospects, it said.
   Overall, the median growth rate for manufacturing sales is
expected to be a barely perceptible 0.89 percent, down from an
almost-as-dismal 0.95 percent this year.
   The median rate was far healthier in 1988, 2.1 percent; and
1987, 3 percent. The median is the point where half he industries
had bigger sales increases and half smaller.
   ``The outlook is generally one of continuing but slow growth for
most sectors,'' said Commerce Undersecretary J. Michael Farren.
   However, the department's forecasts are based on the assumption
the economy will avoid a recession. Private economists, however,
believe the economy was in recession by the fourth quarter of this
year and will continue to shrink through at least the first three
months of 1991.
   The Commerce Department assumed growth in the gross national
product next year would be toward the lower end of a 1 percent-3
percent range, while private analysts look for minimal growth of
around 0.3 percent.
   The 560-page report, ``U.S. Industrial Outlook,'' was prepared
by 130 analysts using information current through August and
September. It goes on sale to the public in January.
   In manufacturing, most of the 10 fastest-growing industries are
connected with either health care or high technology.
   Leather tanning and finishing topped the list, with 9.4 percent
growth. But that was an anomaly in an industry that has undergone
considerable shrinkage in recent years. Much of the predicted
growth was based on the assumption that domestic leather production
would increase because of retaliatory duties imposed on leather
imports from Argentina.
   Leather tanning was followed by semiconductors, the basic
building block of computer chips, with a 8.9 percent increase in
sales projected; and surgical instruments, up 8.6 percent.
   Others in the top 10 were surgical supplies, medicines,
diagnostic substances, poultry slaughtering and processing,
biological products, aircraft and dental equipment.
   On the bottom of the scale was creamery butter, with a projected
sales decline of 14.6 percent. The report attributed the drop to
consumers' worry about cholesterol and weight gain.
   Other shrinking industries were mobile homes, frozen baked goods
except bread, boat building, motors and generators, household
cooking equipment, hardwood and flooring mills, electric housewares
and fans, fabricated metal, and sawmill and planing mills.
   The report also evaluated 166 service businesses, the
fastest-growing sector of the economy. Electronic information
services, computer software and other computer services topped the
list. Slower expansion was projected for movie theaters, home
entertainment and legal services.
   In general, the report said, industries linked to export sales
will fare better than businesses tied to the domestic economy.
   However, Undersecretary Farren conceded that the price of oil,
driven up by the Persian Gulf crisis, likely will prevent the U.S.
trade deficit from dropping below $100 billion this year, as the
Bush administration had predicted earlier. The shortfall was $109.4
billion in 1989.
   Farren said the deficit probably will total $104 billion to $105
billion this year, and about the same in 1991.
   Meanwhile, retail sales in the United States were projected to
rise only 1 or 2 percent after inflation.
   ``Such products as furniture, appliances and household audio and
video equipment are expected to decline,'' Farren said.
   Two key sectors of the economy, construction and motor vehicles,
were forecast to have another bad year in 1991, with their weakness
spilling over into a variety of related industries.
   The survey said high vacancy rates will depress office-building
construction by 15 percent, while hotel construction will fall 20
percent. Residential housing construction was forecast to decline 6
percent, from 1.22 million units to 1.15 million.
   Car sales probably will fall from 9.5 million this year to 9.3
million in 1991, but truck ales likely will rise about 1 percent
to 4.7 million, the report said.

<TEXT>
   In the two years since becoming transportation
secretary, Samuel K. Skinner has been mentioned for so many other
top Bush administration jobs that he has developed a ritual
response.
   Every time his name crops up, he recalled in a recent interview,
he calls the person he is rumored to be anxious to replace.
   ``I tell them there's just nothing to it,'' he said. ``We joke
about it on occasion. We laugh about it.''
   Whether the person at the other end of the phone laughs as
heartily as Skinner isn't known.
   But it seems to be a measure of his standing in Washington that
Skinner's name has come up recently as the rumor mill ground on
about the job of White House chief of staff, already held by John
Sununu; attorney general, a post occupied by Dick Thornburgh; and
director of the Office of Management and Budget, a job held by
Richard Darman.
   Skinner, 52, came to Washington in 1989 as a relatively unknown
figure nationally with an extensive resume and political
connections to President Bush and former Illinois Gov. James
Thompson.
   A night law school graduate, he was in turn an aggressive and
successful computer salesman at IBM, a tough U.S. attorney in
Chicago, a lawyer in private practice and head of the Chicago
area's mass transit authority. He also ran Bush's 1988 campaign in
Illinois.
   Skinner was tested early in Washington.
   When the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground and spilled 11 million
gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince Edward Sound on March 24, 1989,
Skinner flew to the scene as the lead Cabinet officer dealing with
the cleanup.
   He helped shape tighter aviation security in the wake of the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21,
1989.
   Last year, Skinner and the Transportation Department assembled a
congressional-aviation industry coalition that helped pass the most
sweeping legislation since the airline industry was deregulated.
   It included a national policy to curb aircraft noise and a
passenger facility charge to help expand airport capacity and ease
congestion and delays.
   Skinner now is preparing for a struggle on Capitol Hill next
year over his plan to reshape the nation's surface transportation
policy with a five-year bill carrying a price tag said to range
from $70 billion to $90 billion.
   With the 44,000-mile Interstate Highway System all but complete,
Skinner is said to be seeking ways to improve existing highways and
bridges and ease traffic congestion rather than engage in a new
round of expensive road building.
   Meanwhile, his name continues to be bandied about for other
jobs.
   Skinner said one rumor has some basis in fact. He was briefly
mentioned at the White House as a possible successor to the ailing
Lee Atwater as chairman of the Republican National Committee.
   But at times he has suspected that his name is being used by
unnamed others to ``jab or tweak'' an administration colleague
caught up in the capital's political warfare or under scrutiny by
the press.
   ``Sure that happens,'' Skinner said. ``Unfortunately, they grab
my name to do it. Frankly, it's a little frustrating to be
constantly mentioned for something else. These rumors have me doing
six different things.
   ``They have me over here being restless,'' said Skinner, who
added he is far too busy with planes and trains and highways and
multibillion-dollar budgets to be that.
   But in politics one never says never and like most people in his
position, Skinner leaves the door at least slightly ajar.
   ``If the president of the United States - especially a president
that I'm as close to as I am to George Bush - asks me to do
something, I'm going to do it,'' he said. ``... But he's not going
to ask me to do anything. I don't expect him to.''
   When asked by reporters recently what Bush would have to do to
``twist your arm,'' Skinner replied with a flash of humor.
   ``George Bush doesn't have to twist my arm,'' he said. ``He
brought me to the dance and I'll go home with him - if Barbara lets
me.''

<HEAD>StyroCop Patrols Restaurants to Enforce Portland Environmental Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like a patrolman on the beat, Lee Barrett
strides into a Chinese restaurant, flashes his ID card and has a
look around. ``StyroCop'' is on the trail of illicit carryout
containers.
   The city has gotten a complaint that the restaurant is putting
its egg rolls and fried rice in boxes that violate Portland's
year-old ban on polystyrene foam fast-food containers.
   Barrett, 44, a longtime environmental activist, is the ban's
enforcer. A local television reporter dubbed him StyroCop - a
takeoff on the movie ``RoboCop'' - his first day on the job and
he's become something of a celebrity.
   But while he's easily Portland's most visible environmentalist,
Barrett is reluctant to take credit for leading the city into the
``green decade.''
   ``What I do is a fly speck as far as recycling is concerned,''
he said. ``Others do so much. A lot of people have been toiling ...
and they're still out there doing the work.''
   Barrett moved to Portland from New York in 1972, a year after
the Oregon Legislature passed the nation's first ``bottle bill''
imposing a 5-cent deposit on beverage cans and bottles.
   The bill was Barrett's first real exposure to recycling.
   ``Except for a dim, dim memory of saving tin cans during the
Korean War, there was no recycling consciousness at all,'' he said.
   Within a few years, Barrett was on the board of Portland
Recycling Team Inc., a can and bottle depot. By 1978, he was
general manager. When Portland advertised for a contractor to
enforce the plastic foam ban, he applied.
   Barrett believes Americans must go beyond recycling by rejecting
products that are overpackaged and becoming accustomed to using
things again and again.
   ``As a recycler, our creed has always been reduce, reuse,
recycle,'' he said. ``Recycling is the last thing to do before you
throw it away.''
   Opponents of the ban argue that environmentalists should work
with the industry to make polystyrene recyclable. Otherwise, they
say, restaurants will substitute paper, which will wind up in
landfills.
   The Portland law does not restrict containers made of paper or
plastic not blown into foam. Those have been the alternatives used
by fast-food restaurants, the only industry affected by the
Portland law. Few have been willing to switch to glassware and
dishes.
   The 1.2 million people in the metropolitan area send 99,000 tons
of plastic to the landfill each year. That is 9 percent by weight
of Portland's garbage and 18 percent to 20 percent by volume.
   Advocates pushing stricter recycling rules say the plastic is
not biodegradable but simply breaks into small pieces. Birds eat
the pieces of plastic and die.
   Business cited by Barrett face fines of $250 for a first offense
and $500 for each subsequent offense.
   Neither a police officer nor a health inspector, Barett only
responds to complaints received by the city. He's written only a
handful of tickets but says the law is a start and has raised
public awareness.
   Back at the Chinese restaurant, Barrett spots a stack of
carryout containers in the kitchen and holds one up.
   ``That's a hundred percent polystyrene,'' he said. ``Zero
percent air.'' It's legal. Barrett asks to see a storeroom
downstairs, where he finds more of the same.
   He's satisfied but glad he pressed his inspection.
   ``I need a fair amount of evidence that they have complied,'' he
said. ``You can't believe everything that you see.''

   A presidential commission planning the 500th
anniversary celebration of Columbus' voyage to America has been
plagued by problems: a tiny budget, few corporate donations and,
until this month, almost no publicity.
   Now add a conflict-of-interest controversy to its list of woes.
   The panel's chairman, Miami real estate developer John Goudie,
resigned amid disclosures that a close friend has ties to a company
doing business with the commission.
   The event's biggest corporate sponsor, Texaco Inc., suspended
its donations in September after raising questions about the
commission's management. Another potential sponsor, Chrysler Corp.,
may stay away from the event.
   And a congressional subcommittee is looking into Goudie's
involvement with the Christopher Columbus Licensing Group Inc., or
CCLG, of Miami and New York.
   ``To have this project blow up in our faces now is making it
difficult to deal with future sponsors,'' said Frederick
Guardabassi, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., businessman who has served on
the commission since 1985. ``So much damage has been done to the
commission. It's a tragedy.''
   The centerpieces of the celebration are replicas of Columbus'
three ships being built in Spain and originally financed with money
from Texaco. The commission is $600,000 in arrears in payments for
the ships, which are to follow Columbus' route and visit 50 U.S.
ports.
   Chrysler says it wants to clear up unspecified contractual
questions before making a donation of more than $1 million.
   Congress has appropriated $210,000 a year for the commission,
which pays for staff salaries and office space.
   Strapped for cash, the commission turned to CCLG in 1989 because
the company was willing to pay $300,000 immediately for the
licensing rights to Columbus souvenirs, from clocks to key chains
to coffee mugs.
   The rights potentially are worth millions.
   Goudie is a popular fund raiser for Republican candidates in
Florida. His Hispanic background made him a natural for the
commission chairmanship, say GOP figures in Miami who know him.
   This year, CCLG paid at least $35,000 to Manuel Gonzalez, who
describes Goudie as a close friend. The two Miami businessmen have
known each other since their days in junior college, Gonzalez said
during the course of several interviews.
   Other commissioners say they didn't know about Gonzalez' role.
   ``I was stunned,'' said commissioner Charles Ginoli, who served
on the finance committee that reviewed the CCLG contract.
   Gonzalez said he was ``a consultant basically'' to CCLG and that
the firm's president, Gunter Pfitzenmeier, asked him for help in
``trying to drum up business'' for the Columbus celebration.
Gonzalez says he discussed the idea of becoming a stockholder, but
that ``I didn't want to put any money into this thing.''
   ``I have acted ethically and I didn't share any money with
John,'' said Gonzalez.
   In a brief interview, Goudie said he was involved in ``no
improprieties.'' He said Gonzalez brought CCLG to the commission
and that the company was the best of five companies that made
presentations.
   Some businessmen who dealt with CCLG are unhappy.
   Peter Dunev, a Miami clothing manufacturer, agreed to pay
$100,000 to CCLG for what he thought were exclusive rights to make
and sell shirts bearing the official Columbus logo. Dunev said
Goudie introduced him to Gonzalez, and that Gonzalez came by
Dunev's office to pick up two payments totaling $50,000 last
summer.
   After paying the money, Dunev found out that other groups, here
and in Spain, will market their own logos. Dunev complained to
Goudie and Gonzalez. CCLG then canceled his contract.
   Dunev said he's out his $50,000 and, ``I'm concerned with the
direction the Columbus celebration is taking. I'd hate to see it
become a disaster.''
   Then there is Tony Baltes, a souvenir company owner from Toledo,
Ohio.
   Baltes and 21 friends and relatives from Toledo put up $500,000
a year ago in exchange for 25 percent of the stock in CCLG.
   Last March, according to Baltes, Goudie announced he wanted
Gonzalez installed as a stockholder and manager at CCLG. A few days
later, Baltes was removed as a CCLG officer in a letter from
company president Pfitzenmeier.
   ``We wanted to be part of the celebration and the investment was
attractive. Maybe we got sucked in,'' said Baltes, who is suing in
an attempt to win back his post as a CCLG officer.

<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First it was the searing heat,
relentless monotony and a plague of flies, scorpions and vipers.
Now U.S. troops in the Saudi Arabian desert face a new menace:
bone-chilling, teeth-chattering cold.
   It makes nighttime an endurance test and forces soldiers to wear
all the layers of clothing they can lay their hands on.
   ``You can really feel the north wind here. There's nothing to
block it,'' said 2nd Lt. Bob Guillo, 31, of the 5th Battalion of
the 62nd Regiment, 11th Air Defense Brigade.
   ``At nights, the guards look like a bunch of mummies, they're
wrapped up so tight in all their clothing,'' said Guillo, of Long
Island in New York.
   Winter in the desert is relative, of course. Temperatures are
nothing like the frigid blasts that have been wiping out
California's orange crop and dumping snow in the northeastern
United States.
   It's also a far cry from the deep-freeze chills of military
history, such as temperatures of minus-30 at the Chosin Reservoir
in the Korean War, the frost-bitten Battle of the Bulge in 1944 or
Napoleon's disastrous retreat from Moscow in 1812 in which
``General Winter'' and Russian partisans decimated his army.
   But over the weekend, it was 34 degrees in the northern desert
and much colder with the wind chill.
   Highs barely reach 70 degrees. That's a plunge of about 50
degrees in the highs and lows that greeted the first U.S. ground
troops in August.
   ``I didn't know it could get this cold in the desert,'' said
Sgt. Daniel Flores, 27, of Fresno, Calif., serving with the Army's
75th Artillery Brigade.
   The cold makes soldiers burrow deep into their down-filled
sleeping bags to stay warm. Those who pull guard duty at night feel
it the worst.
   Specialist Hector Macias, 25, of El Paso, Texas, looked like
something out of a science-fiction film as he patrolled his
perimeter.
   He wore longjohns under his camouflage fatigues and covered
himself with a night parka and insulated liner. He wore a T-shirt
around his ears and had Arctic mittens to keep his trigger finger
from turning numb.
   ``You can feel it down to the bone. If you don't wear your
longjohns, you'll be freezing out here,'' Macias said.
   The mess tent supplied him with hot chocolate, coffee and soup
during his three-hour watch.
   Traditionally, January and February are the winter months in
Saudi Arabia. It's also the season for the ``shamal,'' which
literally means northwest wind, which spawns sandstorms 100 miles
wide.
   The wind drives the sand at more than 50 mph, stripping paint
off cars and sending a haze 18,000 feet up into the air.
   Soldiers in the northern desert braved a mild sandstorm on
Christmas Day. The sand was so thick it nearly shut down helicopter
traffic and made it impossible to see whole brigades encamped 100
yards away.
   ``This is the closest thing to a snowstorm you'll get in the
desert,'' said Capt. Michael Huber, 30, of Anchorage, Alaska, the
commander of a company of combat engineers in the Army's 20th
Engineer Brigade.
   Most units rig heaters to their outdoor showers for hot water.
The real trick is running back out to get dressed in the tents.
   ``That walk between the showers and the tents is a little
nippy,'' said Specialist Craig Nordstrom, 21, a medic with the
Army's 595th Medical Company out of Fort Devens, Mass.

Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whether you were pleased or peeved by the
performance of America's legislature last year, get ready for
Congress-The Sequel.
   The cast being sworn in this week for the 102nd Congress is much
as it was in the 101st. But the unaddressed problems have grown to
the point where those in starring roles must put in much bigger
performances.
   Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., returns as speaker of the House;
George Mitchell, D-Maine, as Senate majority leader; and Robert H.
Michel, R-Ill., and Bob Dole, R-Kan., as minority leaders of the
House and Senate, respectively.
   Their back-ups, stand-ins and bit players remain the same, too,
as another two-year period of governing begins Thursday. The
football Redskins, a more popular Washington institution, make more
roster changes than the voters make with Congress.
   The plot for the coming session picks up where things left off
last fall. But now it's clear there's much more riding on every
twist.
   Shooting has not broken out in the Persian Gulf, but the level
of tension has risen dramatically.
   Congress immediately faces the prospect of the Jan. 15 deadline
by which Iraq's Saddam Hussein is supposed to withdraw from Kuwait.
   In the event that President Bush carries through with his threat
to attack, Congress must decide whether to insist that he obtain a
declaration of war or some other endorsement of the action.
   The Democrats in Congress have so far been walking a fine line,
balancing their prerogatives under the Constitution with the need
to voice support for the president's policy.
   They also are keenly aware that in the aftermath of Vietnam you
can oppose a war, but you'd better not be seen as less than fully
supporting American fighting men and women.
   If Bush fights a war and quickly wins, Democrats don't want to
be seen as losers. But if the gulf situation drags on in war or
peace and becomes politically unpopular, the Democrats want to be
able to sever their ties with him.
   That will be a major theme at least for the first weeks of
Congress' return.
   ``I think it's make-or-break time for George Bush,'' Dole said
Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
   But the Senate GOP leader wasn't referring just to the Persian
Gulf.
   ``We've got twin problems ... I think he could do very well in
the gulf and still go downhill on the economy,'' Dole said. ``That
may be more difficult to deal with in the final analysis than the
gulf crisis.''
   Like the gulf, the issue of the economy was around when Congress
adjourned last October. But it has become much more sharply defined
since then, as statistics show the recession looking deeper and
perhaps lasting longer than believed a few months ago.
   Both Congress and the White House will come under increasing
pressure to address the nation's economic problems. But the huge
federal deficit, going up despite last fall's approval of tax hikes
and spending restraints, might close the doors on many options.
   The 101st Congress was at times dominated by ethics debates, and
it looks as though the 102nd will be, too.
   The Senate Ethics Committee this week resumes hearings on the
Keating Five, the senators who allegedly did improper favors for
Charles Keating, the top executive of a failed savings and loan
institution.
   Will the five be punished by their peers? And how many tens of
billions of dollars of taxpayers' money will be needed to continue
the S&amp;L bailout? Stay tuned.
   Related unfinished plot lines from the last Congress include
campaign reform and the congressional salary structure. The 102nd
Congress begins with senators getting paid $101,900 and House
members $125,100. Will the Senate follow the House and take a pay
raise in exchange for limits on members' outside earnings?
   Other issues returning from the last Congress include bills to
expand civil rights and to guarantee unpaid leave to workers after
childbirth or for other family emergencies. Bush vetoed those
measures.
   Congress also may attempt to address problems with health care
insurance, education and the nation's trade imbalance.
   It's impossible to predict where events will carry the new
Congress. But undoubtedly the players soon will be looking ahead to
the ending - the 1992 presidential and congressional elections.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Call for Greater Diplomatic Efforts in Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration must try to find a
diplomatic solution to the Persian Gulf crisis before going to war,
top lawmakers say. But they disagree over whether to hold back
money if the fighting starts without congressional approval.
   ``A diplomatic effort really needs to be made and has to be made
before the decision to go to war,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Sunday.
   His thoughts were echoed by the Senate's ranking Republican, Bob
Dole of Kansas, who said he would like to see President Bush
``pursue at least one additional time'' a date for U.S.-Iraqi
discussions.
   ``The American people are not yet committed to war, and they
want to make certain that President Bush has done everything,
pursued every avenue for peace before the firing starts,'' Dole
said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
   Dole said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein may be willing to bend
in an effort to end the stalemate on diplomatic talks.
   He said Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed
Al-Mashat, telephoned him from Baghdad on Saturday night with that
news. ``I had some indication there was some flexibility,'' he
said.
   Previously, Saddam had said he was only able to see Secretary of
State James A. Baker III on Jan. 12, a date rejected by the United
States as too close to the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United
Nations for Iraqi troops to leave Kuwait. A U.N. resolution
authorized the use of force to expel Iraq after that date.
   Dole said Mashat indicated ``it would not have to be the 12th of
January.''
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., appearing with Aspin on CBS-TV's
``Face the Nation,'' predicted an intense round of diplomatic
negotiations as Jan. 15 draws near because ``people are very, very
nervous about the outbreak of war.''
   ``There are some straws that indicate a diplomatic solution may
work,'' he said, but arbitrary deadlines ought to be ignored in any
case.
   The new Congress goes into session Thursday but is expected to
quickly recess until later in the month.
   Bush will meet GOP and Democratic leaders at the White House.
   Lawmakers said they will press Bush on whether he intends to ask
Congress to give him war-making authority before he launches any
attack.
   ``I do think that's a very, very important thing that ... we do
have a vote on that in Congress,'' Aspin said.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., has suggested the
Democratic-controlled Congress might try to cut off money for
Operation Desert Shield if Bush initiates a war without prior
congressional approval.
   Dole called such an attempt ``incredible'' and a ``big, big
political mistake,'' that would not get through Congress.
   But Dole agreed with Gephardt that Japan and Germany should pay
more of the cost of keeping more than 300,000 U.S. troops in the
gulf region.
   Dole, like Bush, expressed optimism the gulf crisis can be
resolved peacefully.
   ``My gut tells me there will be a resolution without firing a
shot,'' he said.
   Bush told Time magazine, in an interview to be published today,
that his instincts told him Saddam would pull troops from Kuwait.
   Meantime, Vice President Dan Quayle today was spending the first
of two days visiting U.S. troops in the desert.

<HEAD>Golf Controversy Follows Quayle to the Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle's decision
to play golf at an American course that bars women is following him
to a country that forbids them to drive cars or socialize or work
with men.
   Quayle cut short an outing last Friday at the Cypress Point Golf
Course in Pebble Beach, Calif., after learning it was the subject
of controversy because it had no black member.
   But he said Sunday he'll continue to play at the male-only
Burning Tree Club in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Md., where
he is an honorary member by virtue of his office.
   ``I've played there before and I'll play there again,''' he said
when questioned by reporters traveling with him to visit U.S.
troops in the Persian Gulf region.
   ``I'm not going to protest Burning Tree,'' he said. ``Maybe
they'll change. I think it would be a good idea for them to take
women into the club. I don't have any problem playing there in the
meanwhile.''
   Further, he noted, ``There are a lot other very well-respected
people that have played at Burning Tree.''
   ---
   The setting was opulent, with the soothing gurgle of indoor
fountains in the airy, gold-trimmed hall where Quayle greeted Saudi
dignitaries on Sunday.
   But the ringing of a loud bell repeatedly disrupted the quiet of
the vice president's first evening in Riyadh.
   It sounded just like a clattering fire alarm, and in fact it
was. Smouldering incense the Saudis were burning to welcome the
Quayle party activated a smoke detector.
   While the room did not seem at all smoky, the detectors high in
the gilded ceilings were very sensitive, Information Ministry
spokesman Mohamed Khayat explained. The long line of robed Saudi
officials filing though the reception line to meet Quayle seemed
oblivious to the intermittent clatter.
   How, then, would they know if the palace was really on fire?
   Khayat said reassuringly that the alarm system is equipped to
ring non-stop, not intermittently, if it detects heavy smoke.

   It's a long way from Sears, Roebuck headquarters in Chicago, but
in some ways, Navy Cmdr. Lou Smith's job isn't that different from
his executive position with the department store chain, he says.
   Smith was director of corporate communications for Sears and
also a Navy reservist, generally fulfilling his military duties one
weekend a month. He had to leave his civilian job when called a
month ago to serve at U.S. military headquarters in Riyadh as
deputy director of public relations.
   In some ways, he said, handing public relations for Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf, the U.S. commander, has parallels to working for
civilian counterparts in the business world who are as powerful in
their own spheres as Schwarzkopf is here.
   Smith, escorting reporters traveling with Quayle, said he never
expected to get such a choice assignment when called to active
duty.
   He stood beneath a mammoth crystal chandelier in the entry hall
of King Fahd's gold-trimmed palace complex where Quayle was meeting
the king and joked with a shrug: ``How am I going to be able to go
back home? It's going to be hard to go back to Sears after this.''

   The Rev. George Stallings Jr., a former Roman
Catholic priest who was excommunicated after forming a church for
disenchanted black Catholics, says he's getting married next year.
   Stallings announced his engagement to Houston attorney Candace
Mosly, 29, at an inaugural banquet Friday for the New Orleans
chapter of his Imani Temple African-American Catholic Congregation.
   ``He said he's wanted to get married and have children for a
long time,'' said William Marshall, Stallings' spokesman.
   Mosly is a prosecutor in the Houston district attorney's office.
   Last year, Stallings, then a priest in Washington, accused the
church of racism and formed his own congregation. He was
excommunicated earlier this year.
   Stallings said his church allows optional celibacy for priests
and the ordination of women.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Vocalist Bobby McFerrin lined up hundreds
of people to hum and sing through a 24-hour event billed as
``Singing for Your Life.''
   McFerrin, whose songs include ``Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' kicked
things off Sunday night at Grace Cathedral.
   McFerrin, winner of nine Grammy Awards, lined up about 300
singers, including members of his all-vocal ensemble,
``Voicestra,'' to participate for several hours each, said Lauren
Artress, canon pastor at the Episcopalian cathedral.
   McFerrin, who lives in San Francisco, said he hoped to show how
music could help people deal with everyday problems.
   ``I've become very fascinated with religious and spiritual
significance of music in Third World countries, where everything is
celebrated and honored,'' he said.

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - Comedian-writer Franklyn Ajaye says ``In
Living Color'' glorifies ghetto life and that's one of the reasons
he's leaving the hit television show.
   ``I have no desire to be hip to the latest black slang and do
the stereotypical hip thing,'' Ajaye says in TV Guide. He says he
left Fox Television's show by mutual agreement.
   ``This whole street, urban rap needs to be pulled back some. The
ghetto is being glorified, and there's nothing good about a ghetto
except getting the hell out of one.''
   The comedy show features skits about two ``homeboy'' thieves who
speak in street slang.
   ``Being black and speaking properly are not mutually exclusive.
... Nelson Mandela speaks beautifully. Should Mandela put his hat
on backward and say, `Yo homey, this is Nelson. Yo, Winnie, yo,

<TEXT>
   Islamic fundamentalists in Pakistan
have no objection to New Year's Eve parties - as long as the
celebrants don't dance, drink or mingle with the opposite sex.
   A group calling itself ``The Tigers of Allah'' has strung
banners throughout the city of Karachi denouncing New Year's
celebrations as a product of the decadent West.
   Skull-and-crossbone insignias emblazon the banners, which warn:
``Beware.''
   Leading the drive against festivities to welcome in 1991 is the
small but powerful Jamaat-i-Islami (Party of God), a key member of
Pakistan's right-wing coalition government.
   ``We're not against celebrations as such, but we are against
what is against decency and our own value system,'' Khurshed Ahmed,
a parliamentarian and Jamaat party leader, said Sunday.
   ``We have warned people that we would not allow these types of
celebrations in a country where Moslems are in government,'' said
Khalid Rehman, another Jamaat leader.
   ``Islam was never that narrow-minded,'' said one religious
analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``People who are like
this, and they are there in every religion, make religion a joke.
What is un-Islamic? That people be happy.''
   But threats canceled parties at all hotels, none of which serve
alcohol because it is banned in this predominantly Moslem nation of
120 million people.
   Mohammad Akram, a Karachi hotel manager, said telephone threats
and warnings put a damper on any festivities.
   The callers ``just say `you better not have any New Year's Eve
celebrations or you will face the consequences,''' Akram said.
   The threatened consequences ranged from bombing the hotel to
throwing stones at it.
   Hotels have taken out advertisements in English and
Urdu-language newspapers promising a quiet New Year's Eve.
   Most restaurants were to close at 10 p.m., ``just in case,''
said another hoetl manager, who declined to be identified by name.
   Many of Pakistan's more liberal Moslems say that because Islamic
fundamentalists have such influence in the governing party, even
individuals are afraid to talk too loudly of planned celebrations.
   ``Everyone is so quiet. They either indiffierent to a
celebration or are afraid,'' said one analyst.
   Pakistan's Moslems follow the Islamic calendar, which begins
with the Prophet Mohammed's 200-mile journey from Mecca to Medina
in 622 A.D.

   Guards armed with machine guns patrol the gray
perimeter wall of Lurigancho prison but rarely venture inside,
where emaciated inmates in rags spend their days picking through
garbage for food.
   The prisoners who populate the prison's brown, barren grounds
are too violent and too diseased, the guards say.
   Many are dying from tuberculosis.
   Conditions in Lurigancho have always been notoriously bad. Then
President Alberto Fujimori slashed government spending, and life
become more tenuous.
   Most of the prisoners in Lurigancho haven't even been convicted
of a crime. Eight of 10 people in Lurigancho are still awaiting
trial and some have been waiting as long as eight years.
   Others completed their sentences long ago but have not been
released.
   Lurigancho is sometimes seen ``as a Nazi-like problem, something
like the final solution ... for the poor,'' said Carlos Caparo
Madrid, former director of the National Penetentiary Institute, the
agency that runs the prisons.
   Many of the inmates agree, and often call the prison a
concentration camp.
   Lurigancho, built to hold 2,800 prisoners, has about 5,500
inmates but no one knows the exact number.
   An average of two prisoners a day die from violence or sicknes,
especially tuberculosis.
   ``It's terrible here. You can get credit on as many drugs as you
want. But there's no medicine. There's no food. All there is are
guns, bullets and drugs,'' said Charles Weedon, 43.
   Weedon, a British citizen, has served six years of a 10-year
sentence for cocaine possession. He lives in Pavilion 7, the cell
block where about 30 foreigners are kept.
   Lacking bads, many prisoners sleep in the open. By day, they
squat in garbage piles looking for food, or hunch over small fires
cooking in tin cans and worn pots. Most of the hundreds of dogs,
cats and rats that once roamed Lurigancho have been eaten.
   Critics of Peru's troubled, overcrowded penal system say lasting
change will occur only if the system gets enough money to upgrade
its every aspect.
   But Peru is struggling with its worst economic crisis this
century, and relief seems distant.
   At one point, the daily budget to feed a Lurigancho prisoner
fell below 10 cents per prisoner. Thousands of prisoners went on a
hunger strike, forgoing the one bowl of thin gruel the government
offered. Nothing changed.
   Inmates are allowed to receive food from family members and
friends, but much of the food is stolen by other prisoners or the
guards.
   Guards, who make about $100 a month, also sell food. Prisoners
say bribes and kickbacks are common at every step.
   Drug use is rampant. The most common drug used by the prisoners
is ``pasta basica,'' semi-refined cocaine that's rolled with
tobacco and smoked.
   ``The only thing that keeps the prison more or less peaceful is
the pasta basica,'' says the Rev. Hubert Lanssiers, a Belgian
priest who has been working with prisoners for 15 years. ``It makes
them sleep, and puts them in a constant dream of resignation.''
   Even so, the prison is not peaceful. Many inmates carry long
knives made of metal bed slats. Fights often claim inmate lives.
   In a June 1986 prison riot, some 125 inmates who belonged to the
Shining Path guerrilla movement were executed at Lurigancho after
they surrendered to paramilitary police. The riot was part of a
coordinated uprising in three Lima prisons during which about 250
inmates were killed.
   Lurigancho is organized into 12 cell blocks. Unofficially, there
is also cell block 13, a former chapel that houses about 35
prisoners, many of them homosexuals and transvestites.
   Cell block 13 is dark as a cave and the walls are stained black
from cooking fires. The inmates huddle and speak in frightened
whispers.
   Jose Santos Acosta has served four years of a six-year sentence
for burglary. His clothes and skin are covered with filth. His
voice is weak because he is dying of tuberculosis.
   Acosta lifts up his ragged shirt to show a chest and abdomen
with long scars. On his side is taped a dirty plastic bag that
holds part of his intestines. Seven years ago he was shot by a
policeman, and the wound has never properly healed.
   ``They can't operate on me until they cure my tuberculosis. But
the doctor here doesn't want to give me the treatment I need,''
Acosta says.
   Soon after he took office in July, Fujimori began a campaign to
reform the entire judicial system.
   He used Lurigancho as an example.
   ``Look at the conditions they live in.... The poor and outcast,
people without means, are rotting away in the jails,'' he said.
   Fujimori pledged to pardon hundreds of prisoners accused of
minor crimes but never sentenced.
   But the government has been slow to act on its promises, and few
believe life in Lurigancho will improve soon.
   ``There's no doubt about it,'' Lanssiers said. ``Lurigancho is
an inferno.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Monday despite some recovery from its sharp decline earlier.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed for the New Year holidays.
   The dollar closed at 135.40 yen, down 0.65 yen from Friday's
close of 136.05 yen. It opened at 134.10 yen and ranged between
134.10 yen and 135.45 yen.
   The dollar's early plunge in Tokyo followed heavy selling in the
Sydney market, which opened before Tokyo, on rumors and news
reports suggesting the possibility of a peaceful solution in the
Mideast, dealers said.
   By mid-morning, however, the dollar narrowed its losses in Tokyo
as some investors bought it back following profit-taking, said
Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   Except for the position adjustments, dealings in Tokyo were
``extremely thin and almost nothing is happening because there is
no market-affecting news here,'' she said. ``Also, few Japanese
investors are participating becauseof the New Year holidays.''
   All markets will be closed Tuesday through Thursday.
   Michiaki Lee, a Citibank dealer, said the dollar's decline
resulted from resurfacing concerns about the state of the U.S.
economy.

<BYLINE>LA Police Say They Foiled Gang Plot to Kill Officers
^By MICHAEL WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said they foiled the plans of a
``pencil-necked, pimply-faced street gang'' to kill police officers
tonight for stifling the drug trade.
   Officers arrested three alleged gang members and seized two
rifles, one handgun and 163 rounds of ammunition during raids early
Saturday in the suburban San Fernando Valley.
   Police Lt. Jim Vojtecky declined to identify the gang. But he
described it as ``a local pencil-necked, pimply faced street gang''
with about two dozen members.
   Authorities said gang members boasted about their assassination
plans on fliers posted around the San Fernando Valley.
   ``I consider them a flock of idiots to tell you the truth,''
said Cmdr. William Booth, a Police Department spokesman.
   Informants also tipped off police, Vojtecky said.
   ``As early as September, we began getting information that local
street gangs were getting ... a little irritated, and we had
indications they were going to attempt to kill a cop because we
were screwing up their drug operations in the streets,'' he said.
   Gang violence in Los Angeles reached a record level in 1990,
accounting for 315 deaths through the first 11 months of the year,
compared to 303 in all of 1989.
   Police said Sergio Camarena and Cesar Reveles, both 18, were
booked for investigation of conspiracy to commit murder. Hector
Aleman, 18, was booked for possession of a sawed-off rifle.
   Camarena and Reveles were held without bail and Aleman remained
in jail Sunday after failing to post $1,000 bail.
   Although authorities said the plot was foiled, they urged
officers on patrol in the San Fernando Valley New Year's Eve to be
aware of it.

<HEAD>Country Bitterly Divided on Pardons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Argentine nation is bitterly
divided over President Carlos Menem's weekend pardon of key figures
in the 1970s military dictatorship that conducted a ``dirty war''
on leftists.
   A key figure in the leftist terrorism of the era, Mario
Firmenich, the 42-year-old co-founder of the Montonero movement,
was also pardoned by Menem.
   But the outcry Sunday was over the military figures freed.
   About 40,000 people - a broad cross-section of ages, income
levels, political parties, unions, professionals, students -
gathered outside Menem's office Sunday afternoon, waving banners
and shouting derisory chants.
   ``We're here to tell him that we haven't forgotten what
happened, and we won't forget,'' said protester Daniel Sossa. He
said his aunt was arrested during the 1976-83 dictatorship and
never heard from again.
   Menem, himself jailed without charge during the period, told
reporters: ``They can have all the marches they want. ... That
doesn't bother me. I believe it was best for my country. Period.''
   Human rights groups called for national mourning and protest
marches.
   But there was joy in a group representing families of victims of
leftist killings at the release of six ex-generals, including
former presidents Jorge Videla 65, and Roberto Viola, 66, and five
other former officials.
   Roman Catholic Bishop Jaime de Nevares said the pardons mocked
justice, broke the law and trampled on human rights. Another church
leader, Archbishop Antonio Quarracino, said they were necessary and
``make me happy.''
   The two rival factions of the General Labor Federation,
Argentina's major labor group, were also divided.
   Recent polls had indicated that up to 80 percent of Argentines
would oppose the pardons, which Menem said would ``close a sad and
black stage of Argentine history'' in announcing them Saturday.
   Videla, freed Saturday after more than five years in prison,
attended Mass at a chapel near his apartment Sunday and handed
reporters a short statement that said in part: ``I ask God to
extinguish forever the hatred among Argentines with the goal that
we all may reconcile ourselves in peace, union and liberty.''
   Viola, Videla and six other senior officers were pardoned for
crimes including torture, illegal detention and murder. Former
finance minister Jose Martinez de Hoz and two former civilian
officials, all of whom had been jailed on other charges, were
included in the pardon.
   Menem said the pardons, by ending a justification for military
restiveness, would allow Argentina to look ahead. But many said
they merely reopened wounds.
   ``The pardons do not leave the past behind, but take us back to
the worst failures of our past,'' said former President Raul
Alfonsin, leader of the main opposition party, the Radical Civic
Union.
   ``This is the saddest day in Argentine history,'' he said.
   Urban terrorist attacks in the 1970s and the military junta's
heavy-handed response still wrench Argentina's national psyche
seven years after the return to democracy with Alfonsin's election
in October 1983.
   Menem was elected last year.
   Alfonsin and the Congress gave amnesty to hundreds of
lower-ranking officers, after three military uprisings against his
government to protest pending trials of soldiers accused of rights
abuses.
   A fourth rebellion to protest Videla's imprisonment was crushed
by the government Dec. 3. Menem had earlier promised the military
that the pardons were in the works.
   The military insists it was forced to use unconventional methods
to stop the leftist guerrillas. But many claim the military used
the insurgency as a pretext for repression.
   At least 8,960 alleged leftists disappeared and were presumed
executed. Human rights put the death toll at about 30,000.

<HEAD>Government Scraps Plan to Pardon Ex-Dictators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK QUINN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Responding to a formidable public outcry,
the government has reversed itself and decided not to go ahead with
announced plans to pardon leaders of the 1967-74 military
dictatorship.
   Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis had said Friday that he
decided for humanitarian reasons to pardon nearly all the jailed
former members of the junta, some of whom are serving life
sentences.
   That provoked cries of outrage from socialists, Communists and
other leftists, both in Greece and on the island of Cyprus.
   It also drew criticism from members of the governing New
Democracy party, Cabinet members and other prominent conservatives.
   On Sunday, the government said it was backing down in order to
avoid ``political tension.''
   ``The universal condemnation both in Greece and on Cyprus by ...
the overwhelming majority of the people forced the government to a
hasty retreat,'' said Andreas Papandreou, the leader of the main
opposition socialists.
   Approval had been expected by a government committee this week,
but newspapers reported Sunday that President Constantine
Caramanlis would not sign the necessary presidential decree. His
office would not confirm the reports.
   Most politicians, conservative and left-wing, were jailed,
tortured or exiled during the seven years of military rule.
   The government's change of heart came at a Cabinet meeting, its
announcement said.
   ``The government believed and believes that democracy in our
country is so strong that it can show its humanity,'' the
announcement said.
   But it said that ``in order to avoid turning this issue into the
object of artificial political tension, it decided to not advance
the procedures for the granting of a pardon.''
   A protest against the pardons had been planned for today.
Papandreou, whose elected socialist government was in power from
1981 to 1989, had said he would request an emergency debate in
Parliament on the issue.
   Leftists accused Mitsotakis of repaying a political debt to a
pro-junta rightist group that has backed his New Democracy Party.
   The former rulers had themselves never sought pardon or amnesty.
But junta supporters have lobbied for an amnesty since the officers
were sentenced.
   Eight members of the junta are serving prison terms ranging from
20 years to life imprisonment, convicgted of treason, torture, or
the murder of pro-democracy student protesters.
   Those serving life sentences include Col. George Papadopoulos,
71, who led the 1967 coup; his brother Constantine; 69; and former
Brig. Dimitris Ioannides, 67. Ioannides, ex-chief of the dreaded
military police, overthrew Papadopoulos in a 1973 coup.
   Under Mitsotakis' proposal, the only junta member who would not
have been pardoned was Ioannides, who also engineered a failed 1974
coup in Cyprus by right-wing supporters of the island's union with
Greece.
   The disastrous coup attempt prompted an invasion of Cyprus by
Turkey, which partitioned the eastern Mediterranean island. It also
caused the junta's collapse and the restoration of democracy in
Greece.
   On Cyprus, nearly all political parties condemned the proposal
to pardon the leaders. Government spokesman Akis Fantis said
Cypriots will always hold the Greek military dictators responsible
for the island's division.

   Secret documents used by the commander of British
forces in the Persian Gulf were stolen and later found dumped in
the trash, apparently discarded by a thief who didn't examine them,
police say.
   A briefcase containing the documents - said to concern British
war plans against Iraq - was delivered to police after being
spotted in a north London dumpster by a passing doctor, police say.
   Defense Secretary Tom King said Sunday that all the documents
were recovered ``but it is a serious matter and it is a matter for
police investigation.''
   The documents could have compromised allied interests in the
gulf, King said, but apparently were not examined.
   The Times of London and other media reports said the documents
were used by Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine, commander of
British forces in the gulf, to brief Prime Minister John Major on
Dec. 17.
   After the briefing, the documents were handed to Hine's personal
staff officer, Wing Cmdr. David Farquhar, to return to Royal Air
Force Strike Command at High Wycombe, northwest of London, the news
reports said.
   Farquhar and his driver stopped the car in west London and got
out to look at some used cars. In the few minutes they were away, a
thief opened the trunk and stole the briefcase, a dictaphone, a
portable television and money.
   The defense ministry said Farquhar had been moved to unspecified
``other duties'' pending an investigation.
   Anthony Beaumont-Dark, a Conservative legislator, said Farquhar
should be court-martialed for failing to strap the briefcase to his
wrist.

   The director of the hospital where
Nancy Cruzan died won a court order against the father of another
patient who wants to remove his brain-damaged daughter's feeding
tube.
   Pete Busalacchi wants to transfer his 20-year-old daughter,
Christine, from the Missouri Rehabilitation Center to Minnesota,
where she could die under a state provision that recognizes ethical
decisions by doctors.
   The hospital's director fought the move, claiming Ms. Busalacchi
has a better chance of recovering than Ms. Cruzan did.
   Ms. Cruzan died at the Missouri hospital Dec. 26 after her
parents won a landmark court battle to have her feeding tube
disconnected.
   Pro-life advocates predicted a ``tidal wave'' of euthanasia
cases after her death.
   Since a 1987 car accident in St. Louis, Ms. Busalacchi has been
in a vegetative state similar to that of Ms. Cruzan, the subject of
the Supreme Court's first right-to-die ruling.
   ``I really sometimes feel with Chris that the light's on but no
one's home,'' Busalacchi said Sunday. ``I believe my daughter is
dead, and all I have left in the hospital is a machine.''
   Judge Scott Sifferman of Lawrence County Court issued a
temporary restraining order Saturday after the center's director,
Don Lamkins, said there is ``scientific and observational
evidence'' that Ms. Busalacchi is aware of her surroundings.
   Lamkins said the 10-day restraining order would allow doctors to
examine her further. Sifferman scheduled a Jan. 8 hearing to review
the doctors' findings.
   Lamkins said Ms. Busalacchi waved at him after a nurse ordered
her to, but her father said there is no indication she responds to
commands.
   ``Yes, her fingers can move. But it doesn't happen on command,''
he said. ``They also say she can smile at you, but it's no smile
that you or I would recognize. It isn't my daughter's smile.''
   Dr. Ronald Cranford of Hennepin County Medical Center in
Minneapolis, a neurologist and medical ethicist, said Ms.
Busalacchi is incapable of conscious thoughts or deliberate
actions.
   Ms. Cruzan's parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, fought a three-year
legal battle to have their 33-year-old daughter's feeding tube
disconnected.
   The Supreme Court ruled last June that Ms. Cruzan, severely
brain damaged in a 1983 car accident, could be allowed to die if
there was ``clear and convincing'' evidence she would want to.
   Although she had left no written instructions on her intentions,
former co-workers testified that she said she would never want to
live like a ``vegetable.'' Busalacchi said he does not have such
proof.
   ``Certainly this has set off the tidal wave we warned about,
since there is no clear and convincing evidence in Christine's case
that she would want to die,'' Rita Marker, director of the
International Anti-Euthanasia Task Force, said Sunday from
Steubenville, Ohio.
   Busalacchi said a doctor told him two years ago that his
daughter's condition was hopeless.
   ``I asked him to compare Chris' condition with Nancy Cruzan's,''
he said. ``He responded with two words: `The same.'''
   He said he was encouraged Sunday by a telephone call from Joe
Cruzan, who ``offered to help in any way he could.''
   ``I've tried to be strong in all of this, but I don't have
anybody to lean on but myself. Sometimes I get angry and
frustrated. When that happens, I do try to think about Chris as she
was.''

   A 14-year-old girl who saved five family
members from their burning home has died of injuries suffered when
she went back in the house, apparently to rescue her pets.
   Jennifer Olson died Saturday at Brookside Hospital in San Pablo.
Firefighters found her unconscious in a smoke-filled bedroom at the
family's Alameda home on Dec. 23.
   Minutes before, she had led her grandfather, 3-year-old sister
and three brothers, ages 2, 5 and 6, to safety after the younger
children accidentally started a fire with papers stuffed into a
plastic doll house.
   Fire officials said she also tried to save the family's dog,
cat, parakeet and hamster. Only the dog survived.
   ``For her age, she did very well, did wonderful,'' said fire Lt.
David LeMoine. ``She got her sisters and brothers out and her
grandfather. She made a mistake going back in. The animals might
have been saved anyway.''
   However, her aunt, Christine Nickoley, 21, said she believed
Jennifer returned to telephone for help.
   ``She loved animals but she wasn't stupid,'' Ms. Nickoley said.
``She would have never come outside and gone back for the
animals.''
   A tape of a 911 call indicates a dispatcher told Jennifer to
break a window, but she was overcome by smoke.
   Jennifer, a sophomore at Notre Dame High School, was remembered
as vivacious and studious.
   The Friday before the fire, she played the role of gun moll
Breathless Mahoney in her school's production of ``Dick Tracy.''
   ``She was a very pretty girl,'' said hospital spokesman Jim
Beaver. ``She was bright, one of those special kinds of kids who
was having a lot of fun.''

<TEXT>
   Young people should hold their New Year's Eve
celebrations indoors or include a chaperone if they want to party
until 1991, police say.
   The city's youth curfew is in effect tonight - despite the
holiday - and extra officers will be on patrol, police said.
   The curfew bars people under 17 from the streets between 11 p.m.
and 6 a.m. weeknights, unless participating in school activities,
returning from work or accompanied by an adult. Parents of repeat
offenders could receive up to 60 days in jail and $1,000 in fines.
   Some local hotels, wary after a luxury tower was pillaged in a
drunken row last year, say they plan to turn away people under 21
who are not registered guests.
   ``If there is a celebration outside, police will be looking at
that situation,'' said Atlanta police spokeswoman Marion Lee.
``That's what we do anyway. There'll be nothing different.''
   The main outdoor New Year's is held downtown. Police expect
130,000 people to gather in a 2{-block area.
   Any youths out past 11 p.m. without an adult or parental
permission will be escorted home by police, Ms. Lee said. Officers
intend to check with parents to confirm any child's story, she
said.
   ``If kids have the justification for being out on the streets
outside the time limit, if we get a confirmation from a parent, we
have no problem with that,'' she said. ``It's for those loitering,
hanging around, without an obvious purpose. That's who we're
concerned about.''
   Thirty-one violators have been detained and 24 parents have been
given warnings since the curfew took effect Nov. 19, according to
police records.
   Supporters say the curfew is needed to help curb violence. FBI
statistics show Atlanta had 210 reported serious crimes per 1,000
residents during 1989, higher than any other U.S. city.
   Security will be tight at the Marriott Marquis hotel, the site
of a destructive fracas last New Year's Eve. Fifteen people were
injured and 50 were arrested when celebrating young people hurled
furniture, potted plants and debris off high-rise indoor balconies
into the lobby.
   Managers were to monitor the Marquis' entrances, said general
manager Ted Renner.
   The Hyatt Regency was to close its doors at noon today, said
spokeswoman Nancy Ziprik. After that, only guests or others with
official hotel business were to be allowed in.

<TEXT>
   The Procrastinators Club could get a bad
name for this. It released its 1990 predictions a day before the
year ended.
   ``Normally, we wait until the very last minute to make these
predictions. But we want to get this year over with,'' said
president Les Waas, who released the list on Sunday.
   The club's annual ``forecasts'' have been completely accurate
for the past dozen years. Among the latest predictions:
   -``A lip-synching pop group named Milli will mourn the loss of
its beloved Grammy.''
   -``An NFL team will show more of its stuff in the locker room
than on the field.''
   -``The biography of a dog named Millie will outsell one written
by a former resident of the same house.''
   -``A TV star will grab more than attention while singing our
national anthem.''
   -``Liz Taylor will parlay one scent into many dollars.''
   -``A Trumped-up fortune will crumble as a Donald ducks.''
   And perhaps most outlandish of all: East and West Germany will
reunite.
   The club formed in 1956 and now has has 8,500 members. Waas
estimates a half million potential members haven't gotten around to
joining.
   He said the club would never make advance predictions.
   ``It doesn't make sense,'' he said. ``By doing it our way, in
one year we make more correct predictions than all of the other
major prognosticators.
   ``Our theory is if you wait until the last minute to do
something, it still gets done, and look at all the time you save,''
he said.
   ``Let's say you do your income taxes at the last minute. That
takes about three hours. If you start to do them now, it'll
probably take the next three months, and you'll be worrying about
them all the time, too.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen in
slow trading today despite some recovery from its sharp decline
earlier in the day.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed for the New Year holidays.
Both the stock and foreign exchange markets will begin 1991 trading
on Friday.
   The dollar closed 1990 trading at 135.40 yen, down 0.65 yen from
Friday's close of 136.05 yen. It opened at 134.10 yen, its low for
the day, and ranged as high as 135.45 yen.
   The dollar had finished 1989 trading at 143.40 yen. During 1990,
it ranged between 124.40 yen and 159.95 yen.
   Monday's spot trading totaled $3.09 billion, compared with
Friday's $5.5 billion.
   A dealer at the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the dollar's sharply lower opening resulted from
investors' low expectations for the U.S. economy. Last week, the
dollar had been rising on purchases for year-end settlements.
   Today's trading was quiet, with not much market-affecting news,
the dealer added.
   Another dealer said the dollar's early plunge in Tokyo followed
heavy selling in Sydney, where trading started earlier, on rumors
and news reports suggesting the possibility of a peaceful solution
in the Middle East.
   Fears of Middle East war had weakened the yen because Japan
imports almost all of its oil, and 70 percent of it comes from that
region. The dollar also is seen as a safe haven in troubled times.

<HEAD>Tokyo Phone Numbers to Have Eight Digits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The new year brings double trouble for the
absent-minded in Tokyo. Along with remembering a new date, they'll
have to remember new telephone numbers.
   Telephone numbers in the metropolitan area will expand to eight
digits to cope with an overwhelming demand for more telephone
lines, the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. said today.
   After 2 a.m. Tuesday, callers will have to dial a ``3'' before
the current seven-digit local Tokyo numbers. Beepers and phones in
some areas of Tokyo already have eight digits, but most Japanese
numbers currently have seven.
   The change will affect about 6.14 million telephone numbers. The
seven-digit system has the capacity for 10 million numbers, but
``with eight-digit numbers, we won't have to worry about the lack
of phone lines for a long time,'' said NTT spokesman Haruo Maeda.
   NTT has spent some $37 million on the switchover, including
yearlong mechanical changes and public announcements since
September.
   Some confusion is expected at first.
   ``Since people have been used to the 7-digit numbers for so
long, it might be difficult to switch to the new system right
away,'' said Masatoshi Inadome of NTT's customer service. ``Many
will have to learn after at least one failure,'' he said.
   ``We are afraid many people may forget to fix numbers programmed
into their fax machines, personal computers and telephone sets,''
he said. ``The problem is that callers can hear our recorded
reminder when they forget to add the extra digit, but fax users
won't,'' Inadome said.
   In addition to the pre-recorded tape service to remind those who
forget to add the extra ``3,'' dozens of NTT staffers will stay
overnight in their branches nationwide to help callers.
   Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co., the nation's leading long distance
carrier, will also provide tapes in Japanese and English to remind
callers of the change, Inadome said.

   Former hostage Frank Reed has appealed to
Syrian President Hafez Assad to help free 13 Westerners still held
in Lebanon.
   ``I beg you and all nations within the community of man to reach
into their wells of justice and sense of humanity and come to their
rescue,'' Reed wrote in a letter to Assad. He wants to meet with
the Syrian president.
   ``What a perfect season for Syria to demonstrate to all
Americans and the world that its sense of humanity and human caring
goes beyond standing guard together in the sands of Arabia,'' the
letter said.
   Reed said Sunday he discussed the hostages during a 30-minute
meeting in Washington Dec. 14 with Syrian Ambassador Walid
Al-Moualem. He gave Al-Moualem letters for Assad and followed up
with a mailgram Dec. 27, but said he has received no reply.
   Al-Moualem had greeted Reed when he was released in Damascus,
Syria, last April after 44 months in captivity. Six of the 13 are
Americans, but no Americans have been freed since Reed and Robert
Polhill were released within nine days of each other.
   ``Bothering me was the enormous attention paid in the media and
by our administration to people who were detained in Iraq and
living in special conditions that in no way could be comparable to
what the situation was in Lebanon,'' Reed said. ``So I decided to
take it upon myself and go to the Syrian government.''
   Reed noted in one letter that it was the sixth Christmas in
captivity for Terry Anderson, 43, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press, and Thomas Sutherland, 59, acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut.
   Peggy Say, Anderson's sister, plans to travel to Lebanon in
January and has vowed not to return without her brother.
   ``I would probably do the same thing after all this time,'' Reed
said. ``Her presence will possibly remind everybody there her
brother is a hostage and should be released.''
   The other American captives are Joseph Cicippio, 59, acting
comptroller at the American University in Beirut; Edward Tracy, 59,
West Beirut resident; Alann Steen, 51, a communications instructor
at Beirut University College, and Jesse Turner, 42, professor of
mathematics and computer science at Beirut University College.
   The hostages are believed to be held by pro-Iranian Islamic
Shiites. Syria has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon and has tightened
its grip as the major power broker there.

<HEAD>Soviet Troop Commander In Eastern Germany Fired After Officers
Desert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander-in-chief of Soviet troops in what
was East Germany was fired after two senior officers deserted and
stole missiles and other armaments, the government newspaper
Izvestia reports.
   Gen. B. Snetkov was fired after the desertions of Lt. Col. M.
Kolesnikov, a regimental commander, and Capt. G. Moiseyenko, leader
of a supply unit, Izvestia said Sunday.
   Also fired were Gen. A. Kolinichenko, chairman of the political
department of the troops stationed in eastern Germany; Maj. Gen. A.
Zhurov, whose position was not given; and the chairman of the
personnel department, Maj. Gen. Shipilov.
   Izvestia did not give a specific date of Kolesnikov and
Moiseyenko's desertions and it did not say when Snetkov was fired.
   It said the desertions were discovered on Nov. 29 when a new
regimental commander was sent to replace Kolesnikov, who had been
ordered back to Moscow.
   ``They did not leave with empty hands,'' Izvestia quoted Col. A.
Korotkov of the military procurator's office as saying of the
deserters.
   Korotkov said three anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft weapons
and other armaments were missing. He said the armed was conducting
a criminal investigation.
   Izvestia quoted him as saying the crime rate within Kolesnikov's
regiment had risen recently, and that the commander was recalled to
Moscow because ``he could not perform his duties'' and had
``developed a great passion for enriching himself.''
   Izvestia said 145 servicemen have deserted the Soviet units
stationed in eastern Germany and 49 have applied for political
asylum.

<HEAD>UC Berkeley Students Unearth Greek Monument</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of archaeology and history students
made a ``one in a million'' find when they uncovered an ancient
monument that the Greek historian Plutarch had written about, their
professor said.
   The monument commemorates a battle in east-central Greece in 86
B.C. at which the Romans defeated invaders from Asia Minor.
   It was uncovered last February by students from the University
of California, Berkeley, said John Camp, a Berkeley professor of
archaeology and co-director of U.S. excavations in Greece.
   ``The odds of finding a historically attested inscription must
be one in a million,'' Camp said. He reported the find Sunday at a
meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America.
   Plutarch, who lived from about 46 to 120 A.D., referred to the
battle at Chaironeia and the monument in his book ``Life of
Sulla,'' a biography of the Roman general.
   Two local men, Homoloichos and Anaxidamos, were credited with
leading Roman troops up a hidden path and surrounding the invaders.
   The monument's Greek inscription proclaims: ``Homoloichos and
Anaxidamos are heroes.''
   The students found the monument while searching through piles of
rock near what was known as Mount Thourion, near where they
believed the battle had occurred.
   ``To actually be able to put your hands on this physical thing
that is the proof of an ancient story is very exciting,'' said
Gretchen Umholtz, one of the students.
   The announcement of the discovery was delayed until paperwork
required by the Greek government was completed, Camp said.
   The Greek government promised to put the monument in a museum
and the students were invited to submit an article on the find to
the American Journal of Archaeology, he said.

<HEAD>Rap Comes Back to Oakland Stage After Yearlong Moratorium</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Amid police barricades and metal
detectors, rap music returned to one of the city's largest
auditoriums after a yearlong ban imposed to curb violence at
concerts.
   The moratorium ended Saturday when Too Short and Ice Cube played
under unusually tight security for 3,000 fans in the Henry J.
Kaiser Auditorium.
   It was the first such show since violence prompted officials at
the auditorium and the Oakland Coliseum to ban rap concerts for a
year. The Coliseum has yet to book another rap show.
   ``I'm glad it's back,'' said fan Tom Armstrong, 27. ``Rap is
good for Oaktown. It's what's happening here.''
   Concert promoter Bill Graham said he increased his security
force by about one-third and the auditorium's managers designed a
special security plan for the concert.
   A police helicopter hovered overhead, lighting the parking lot
with a bright beam. Barricades circled the parking lot and fans
were ushered through a maze of metal gates before they reached the
hall's entrance, where they were searched and then scanned by a
metal detector.
   At the end of the show, the crowd was herded out past a line of
police officers and security personnel.
   ``Just another Saturday night dance,'' Graham quipped. ``We want
to let the negative element know we're here to take care of
things.''
   A fight between rival gangs at a 2 Live Crew concert in December
1989 capped a series of violent incidents that led to the ban,
including a fracas at the Coliseum during which one person was
shot.
   Too Short, known for biting and sometimes raunchy lyrics,
repeatedly reminded fans to stay calm Saturday night. There were no
major incidents, officials said.

<HEAD>Tent City in Kremlin's Shadow Dismantled</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For more than five months, protesters from across
the country tested the tolerance of Soviet authorities with a tent
city that went up just 200 yards from the Kremlin.
   In several hours Saturday night, police with bulldozers cleared
it away.
   ``The order was to clear it out by New Year's and give the
impression that all the issues were resolved,'' Vadim Shilov, a
22-year-old resident of the tent city, said in a telephone
interview.
   The protesters pressed a variety of causes reflecting the social
upheaval in the Soviet Union.
   Some of the signs that adorned the tents and shacks denounced
the Communist Party; others told of losing homes and jobs because
the protesters had dared to criticize their bosses.
   Rumors had been floating since September that authorities would
clear away the nearly 30 plastic and cardboard shacks erected in
front of the giant Rossiya Hotel.
   According to several sources, police and bulldozer crews moved
in Saturday night, acting on orders of the Moscow City Council.
   Shilov said riot police wearing bulletproof vests took away
about 50 people, beating some with truncheons. His account could
not be independently confirmed.
   Two city police dispatchers, refusing to give their names, said
Sunday that some of the squatters were bused to police centers for
people not registered at any address. Others who were registered
were given tickets home.
   One of the police dispatchers offered the only official
explanation of the city council decision. ``Those people violated
sanitary norms,'' he said.
   Neither dispatcher was able to give a number of the squatters,
but a reporter had seen about a dozen at the tent city earlier
Saturday.
   The collection of shacks and protest posters was a symbol not
only of the social turmoil caused by Gorbachev's reforms, but also
of his moves toward democracy that included an unprecedented
tolerance of dissent.
   Before Gorbachev, the eyesore - located so close to the
country's most sacred governmental shrines - would have been torn
down immediately and its instigators jailed for years.
   Official doctrine maintained that such phenomena could only
exist in the West, where exploitation and injustices were rampant.
   ``The tent city originally was supposed to demonstrate what
democracy is like in the Soviet Union. We are a litmus paper of
Soviet democracy,'' Zhanna Fedina, a 54-year-old former regular at
the tent city, said Sunday in a telephone interview. She said she
did not witness the removal of the squatters.
   The protest began July 2, when the demonstrators put up the
tents and shacks, hoping to attract official attention and help in
their struggles with government. They generally arrived at 8 a.m.
and left at 9 p.m.
   The initial targets were delegates attending a congress of the
Communist Party in the nearby Kremlin in early July.
   Passersby would slowly walk past the tents, some of which were
merely poles with clear plastic sheets draped over them. Others
were more elaborate: store-bought, olive green canvas tents with
stones carefully placed outside to form a makeshift porch.
   It was the first thing tourists leaving the Rossiya saw, with
the colorful St. Basil's cathedral and the Kremlin forming a
backdrop.

<HEAD>President Reaffirms Goal of Doubling GNP in New Decade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Yang Shangkun today reaffirmed the
Chinese government's goal of doubling the gross national product in
the coming decade.
   ``I am fully confident in the realization of this goal,'' Yang
said in New Year's greetings over Radio Beijing, China's state-run
international radio.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978 set the goal of quadrupling
China's GNP by the turn of the century.
   The GNP doubled during the booming 1980s and economists say that
even with moderate growth, China's GNP should reach the goal of
$538 billion by the century's end.
   Moderate growth is what the ruling Communists mandated in the
economic and social blueprint for the 1990s they released Sunday.
The document suggests no dramatic new reform initiatives, urging
instead a return to basics.
   Economically, that will mean more funds for agriculture, raw
materials industries, the infrastructure and the military.
Politically, the emphasis will be on ideological discipline and
collective labor.
   ``For a long time to come, we must persist in ... building the
country through thrift and diligence,'' the party Central Committee
exhorted in the communique adopted at a secret, six-day meeting
that ended Sunday.
   The document filled the front pages today of all leading
newspapers. Several newspapers also carried editorials applauding
the party for the ``complete success'' of its meeting, which had
been delayed months by internal debates.
   In the end, the conservatives appeared to have dominated, if
only by sheer force of numbers. In addition to 278 full and
alternate members of the Central Committee, the meeting was
attended by 268 members of the Central Advisory Commission and
Commission for Discipline Inspection, party bodies made up largely
of elderly ideological hard-liners.
   While leaving the door open to further market-style economic
reforms, the document stresses that the goal is to make the
socialist system work better, not replace it with capitalism.
   The communique did not mention directly the collapse of
socialism in most other countries, but reflected the siege
mentality that has developed among China's aging revolutionaries
since they crushed a democracy movement at home last year and
watched similar movements succeed in Eastern Europe.
   Western observers believe the party's difficulty in drafting the
plans for the 1990s reflects a leadership vaccuum. Senior leader
Deng, 86, appears to have lost considerable prestige since the
massive 1989 democracy movement and bloody crackdown that followed.
   The communique made only a single, perfunctory mention of Deng's
historical contributions. It failed to mention his recent call for
``better, more rapid and more effective'' reform.
   Reform was one of the key issues dividing the committee.
   Party elders such as 86-year-old Chen Yun, who helped implement
initial market-style reforms in the 1980s, argued that private
enterprise and free markets should not be allowed to replace the
state sector.
   The communique echoed Chen's position by urging efforts to
strengthen the inefficient, debt-ridden state sector and establish
more collective companies in the service sector, now dominated by
private entrepreneurs.

   Iraq today ordered 17-year-old males to
report for military duty, escalating preparations for war as the
U.N-ordered Jan. 15 deadline to leave Kuwait draws closer.
   A brief announcement by the General Mobilization Headquarters
instructed Iraqi men born in 1973 to sign up with the nearest
recruitment center between Jan. 2 and Jan. 10.
   The announcement, carried by the official Iraqi News Agency and
Baghdad Radio, threatened those who fail to respond to the callup
with unspecified ``legal action.''
   It was the fourth major callup of reserves in recent weeks.
Those drafted earlier included an unspecified number of men aged
30, 31 and 32.
   The London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies
recently reported that the country of 17 million has about 1.1
million males ranging in age from 13 to 17, some 900,00 ranging in
age from 18 to 22 and 1.3 million ranging in age from 23 to 32.

   Most of the nation emerged from two weeks of frigid cold today,
but as the snows melted, floodwaters swamped parts of the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys and the Appalachian mountains.
   Snow fell in parts of New York, the Midwest and the South early
today, and subzero temperatures made it shivery cold in Iowa, North
Dakota and Nebraska. But overall, temperatures were much warmer
than they were at the beginning of the weekend.
   A band of showers was moving along the Eastern Seaboard, from
Maine to Florida, but rain was not expected to move very far inland
in most areas outside the South.
   More snow was expected in hard-hit Washington state and the
Upper Great Lakes region, however.
   Elsewhere, the forecast generally called for cloudy skies but
pleasant temperatures.
   Highs in the 50s were expected for most of the East Coast and
Southwest today, ranging from the 20s to the 40s in the Midwest,
getting up to about 10 degrees in the Great Lakes region, and
reaching the 40s and 50s in California.

   A bomb ripped through a toilet at an outdoor
market in the heart of Jewish west Jerusalem today, killing an Arab
woman who apparently was handling the explosives, police said.
   They said the victim was a 24-year-old woman from the occupied
West Bank.
   ``Apparently the person who was handling the charge was killed
in this toilet stall,'' said police commissioner Yaacov Terner. She
was alone in the toilet and there were no other casualties, he
said.
   The explosion occurred at about 11:30 a.m. at the Mahane Yehuda
market. Terner said the woman was ``torn to pieces'' but a witness
said she was still alive immediately after the blast.
   Shopkeeper Meir Cohen said he ran into the toilet and found the
woman lying under a fallen door. ``She was alive, the woman. I
lifted her head. She moved her head as if she wanted to speak,
wanted help,'' he said.
   Cohen said she had something in her hand which he feared might
be another bomb, so he ran to nearby police to summon help.
   Shahar Ayalon, a senior police officer, said a bag of vegetables
was found beside the woman, and ``it is reasonable to assume that
she intended to plant the bomb in the bag and place it on one of
the adjacent streets.''
   The explosion apparently was relatively small. A cookie vendor
30 feet from the toilet said he heard a muffled pop that did not
even shake his stall. The only exterior sign of damage to the
toilet was a shattered window.
   Police sealed the immediate vicinity of the toilet, but there
was no panic. Hundreds of shoppers continued about their business.
   The blast occurred on the eve of the 26th anniversary of the
first armed attack inside Israel by Fatah, the mainstream guerrilla
arm of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Asked whether he thought the bomb was linked with the
anniversary, Terner said: ``I have no doubt it is connected.''
   Terner said police were making ``a huge effort'' to forestall
trouble in Jerusalem and elsewhere.
   Appeals were broadcast over the market's public address system
for shoppers to ``be wary of suspicious packages and report
anything suspicious to the police immediately.''
   Knots of young men, many of them ultra-orthodox Jews, gathered
at the market, occasionally waving their fists and chanting ``Death
to the Arabs.'' Someone tossed into the air a handful of leaflets
of Kach, the extreme anti-Arab movement founded by the late Rabbi
Meir Kahane.
   Mahane Yehuda has been a bomb target before, most recently in
May, when an explosion killed an elderly man and wounded nine other
people.
   On Sunday night, a 19-year-old Palestinian was killed in an
explosion near Israeli military government headquarters in the West
Bank city of Nablus, the army said. It said the bomb exploded as he
was priming it.
   The occupied Gaza Strip, scene of serious clashes Saturday in
which four Arabs were shot dead, was almost entirely under curfew
today to head off Fatah anniversary celebrations.
   It was the 22nd time the Gaza Strip has been under blanket
curfew since March 1988, near the start of the three-year-old
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule.
   A 23-year-old man was found dead today in a valley outside his
West Bank village of Shuyukh, near Hebron, Arab reports said. They
said Mohammed Yunis Hussein was murdered for allegedly
collaborating with Israel.
   His death raised the number of alleged collaborators killed
during the uprising to 323.
   Another 786 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis soldiers
and civilians, and 57 Israelis have died.

   Vice President Dan Quayle today told
Marines preparing for war near the Kuwaiti border that ``you have
been patient enough and so has President Bush'' in waiting for a
peaceful solution to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``The fact is that a policy of indefinite patience only could
lead to a policy of appeasement,'' which would make Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein the victor in the gulf standoff, Quayle
told the gathering of Marines.
   Quayle, on a New Year's morale building-mission, visited the
Third Marine Aircraft Wing, the closest fixed-wing aircraft group
to the border of occupied Kuwait.
   His tour, by helicopter and military truck through the deep
desert sands, also took him to the Army Third Armored Cavalry
Regiment out of Fort Bliss, Texas, which is closer to the border
than any other troops President Bush has sent to the gulf. Quayle
visited a base 40 miles from Kuwait.
   On Sunday he met Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, who gave assurances
that his country would provide more cash and services to support
the anti-Iraq coalition, senior administration officials said.
   Quayle, in brief remarks to the Marines, criticized members of
Congress who urge waiting longer for the U.N.-imposed sanctions to
force Saddam to withdraw his troops from Kuwait.
   ``You have heard some voices at home urging patience. They say
wait a year or two, let the sanctions work,'' Quayle said. ``But
the sanctions have not gotten Saddam out of Kuwait. You have been
patient enough and so has President Bush.''
   ``Saddam Hussein may not withdraw unconditionally, and if he
doesn't he will be forced out of Kuwait by military action,'' the
vice president said. Quayle reiterated Bush's promise that any
force will be speedy and decisive and will not lead to a drawn-out
conflict as in Vietnam.
   ``It may turn out that the only language Saddam Hussein
understands is the language of force.''
   Quayle mingled with the Marines and Army troops at the two sites
where heavy action would be expected if war does occur, said Army
Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller. At the Marine base he inspected
Harrier fighter planes that Marine Maj. Jim McCLain said are only
three minutes flying time from the border of occupied Kuwait.
   Quayle received a cordial greeting from the troops, most of whom
told him they were prepared to do their job and were anxious to get
it over with.
   His entourage inspected cluster bombs that had slogans inscribed
on them such as ``Merry Christmas, no New Year.''
   ``I'm nervous and scared. I'm not afraid to say that any more.
We're sitting right on the verge of where there might be
fighting,'' Lance Corp. Richard. Kamoe of Honolulu told a reporter.
   Quayle mentioned in his speech that his father and brother were
both in the Marine Corps ``and not withstanding my own service in
the Army National Guard, the Marines in the Quayle household are
no.1,'' he said to applause.
   The controversy over Quayle's National Guard service seemed to
make little impression on the young troops serving here. Quayle was
accused when Bush selected him as his running mate of having used
family connections to get a position in the Indiana National Guard
and avoid being drafted and going to Vietnam.
   ``Other people have done worse things than him,'' said Marine
Cpl. Kimberly Gender, of Bloomfield, Ind.
   Waller, who caused a firestorm of controversy by saying on
December 19 that the troops would not be fully ready for combat by
the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait,
escorted Quayle on his tour of the desert bases.
   Waller was reticent to discuss his earlier comment that he would
recommend against launching an attack until mid-February. ``The
component commanders have said they are ready,'' he told a
reporter. ``My job is to support'' Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,
commander of the U.S. operation here and the commanders of each of
the services.
   Asked if he would be making a recommendation on whether to make
a strike, he replied, ``no,... everyone has all the information
they need to make that decision.''
   Quayle's trip is also aimed at seeking continued financial
support from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait's deposed rulers. He was
assured Sunday by King Fahd that with the looming possibility of
war, Saudi Arabia will offer more cash and services, said senior
administration officials traveling with the vice president.
   ``There seems to be no problem'' with getting more money from
Fahd, said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Quayle was assured by Fahd that the king had ``no reticence''
regarding a military conflict should that be needed to oust the
Iraqis, said the U.S. official who briefed reporters on the
meeting.
   Quayle and Fahd were in ``virtually complete agreement on what
needs to be done'' to force Iraq out, but did not discuss details
of what would happen after Jan. 15, the official said.
   In the meantime, Quayle told reporters he would impress on the
Saudis and the exiled emir of Kuwait, when he meets him Tuesday,
that ``they will have to be making more contributions'' to support
the deployment of some 300,000 American troops.
   ``This crisis is going to continue,'' he said.
   An official who attended the Quayle-Fahd meeting said, ``The
impression that was left was that (the Saudis) would continue to be
forthcoming'' in financial and other support, such as free fuel.
``They don't want any perception of any reluctance on that issue.''
   So far, Saudi Arabia has contributed $9 billion, nearly half of
it in cash and the rest in material support, according to the State
Department, and Kuwait has given $2.5 billion.
   Administration officials have estimated the operation will cost
$30 billion in 1991.

   Promoters called off a concert by the punk
rock band Bad Religion a day after angry fans trashed a theater and
damaged neighboring storefronts.
   Organizers said the concert at the Whisky A-Go-Go in West
Hollywood was canceled Sunday night to avoid a repeat of the melee
that erupted Saturday night after the group's concert at a North
Hollywood theater was shut down.
   Fans hurled bottles, smashed store windows and ripped out seats
after fire officials ordered the Classic Theater closed because of
overcrowding.
   Two police officers and several people in the crowd suffered
minor injuries in the fracas. Four people were arrested for
investigation of vandalism.
   Lead singer Greg Gaffin said the melee was at odds with the
message that Bad Religion is attempting to spread.
   ``What we try to do in our songs is make people responsible for
their own actions,'' Gaffin said during the disturbance.
   The owners of the Classic Theater were cited Sunday on charge of
overcrowding and improper use of the facility, which fire officials
said was not licensed for live entertainment.
   Police estimated damage to the theater and surrounding
businesses at $20,000.
   Fire officials said the theater was ordered closed after an
inspector counted as many as 1,900 people in the building. The
theater is permitted to seat 1,261, said fire spokesman Tony Ennis.

   A U.S. Marine has died from an
accidental gunshot wound inflicted when another Marine's M-16 rifle
discharged, U.S. military officials said today.
   The shooting occurred Saturday morning, and an investigation
into the incident is being conducted. The Marine was a member of
the 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment. Officials did not identify
the victim.
   The Marine was taken from a forward field position to a U.S.
military medical facility where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
He was under a doctor's care during transit, the officials said on
condition of anonymity.
   His death brought the number of U.S. servicemen killed in
Operation Desert Shield to 82, 77 of those deaths accidental. Three
people died of natural causes and two of self-inflicted wounds.

<HEAD>Iraq Claims 4,200 Citizens Died Because Of Embargo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's health minister claimed Monday
that more than 4,200 people have died because of shortages in
medical supplies brought on by a U.N. embargo. Western officials
have repeatedly challenged similar Iraqi claims.
   Western officials say Iraq has received 120 tons of medicine
from humanitarian groups since mid-October, and have dismissed
Baghdad's claims on infant deaths since the embargo.
   The minister, Abdul-Salam Mohammed Said, accused President Bush
of ``criminal action'' depriving the Iraqi people of their needs.
   In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency, Said
claimed that since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, said 2,042
children under age 5 have died of malnutrition or diseases that
spread because vaccines could not be obtained.
   The statement, monitored in Cyprus, said 2,182 Iraqis over 5
have died because of shortages in medicines ``for various cardiac
problems, cancers, diabetes and high blood pressure.''
   Shipments of food and medicines for humanitarian purposes are
not banned by the U.N. embargo begun after the Iraqi invasion.
   But Baghdad claims many governments have refused to allow export
of goods, even medicines ordered and paid for before the sanctions.
   Western diplomats suggest that the government might be
stockpiling medicine in case of war, and that some of the reported
shortages resulted from profiteering.
   The claims of shortages have increased markedly since the U.N.
Security Council passed a resolution on Nov. 29 authorizing
military action against Iraq if it does not withdraw from Kuwait by
mid-January.

   More than 1 million gallons of sludge seeped
into New York Harbor after a municipal barge collided with a ship
carrying molasses, the Coast Guard said today. The molasses didn't
leak.
   The 380-foot barge Lemon Creek collided Sunday morning with the
433-foot-long Lodestar King as the ship was about to dock at an
anchorage in the upper bay, said Petty Officer David Cook, a Coast
Guard spokesman.
   The sludge leaked from an 18-inch hole below the barge's water
line, Cook said. There were no leaks on the Lodestar, he said.
   The cause of the collision was not immediately determined, but
fog definitely was a factor, Cook said.
   At the time of the collision, the Lemon Creek was being towed to
the nearby Gravesend anchorage in New York harbor. The barge is
normally used to transport municipal sludge to a dumping site 106
miles out to sea, he said.
   Early today, the ship was moored at Bay Ridge anchorage and the
barge was at Gravesend anchorage, Cook said.

   A couple locked a good Samaritan in the trunk
of her own car and then went for a joyride in it, laughing and
talking for hours while she lay bound and gagged, authorities said.
   The victim was found Saturday, more than 24 hours after she was
kidnapped, when someone noticed the parked car rocking up and down.
   The woman, whose name was withheld, told police that a man asked
for her help outside a car repair shop about 11 a.m. Friday, saying
he was having car trouble.
   The woman with him held a baby, said police spokeswoman Carmine
Menchel.
   She told police the man got into her car, then pulled a gun and
demanded her belongings. She gave them to him, said Menchel, and he
forced her into the trunk, stuffed a towel into her mouth and taped
it and her hands with masking tape.
   The victim, who is in her 30s, told Menchel the couple laughed
and talked as they drove around for hours.
   When the car and the talking stopped the woman tried to scream
but was unable to because of the gag, Menchel said. She rocked the
car back and forth, and finally heard a passerby say, ``There's
somebody in there.''
   That person called police, who were able to open the trunk,
Menchel said.
   The victim was treated at the scene, Menchel said.

   Frustrated with the slow pace of
justice after his only son was murdered four years ago, Joseph
Viscido spent $50,000 investigating the case on his own. His dogged
detective work finally paid off.
   Three men are jailed and awaiting trial on first-degree murder
charges in the shooting death of Joseph Viscido Jr. Two of the
defendants are to be tried in February. A third is fighting
extradition to Florida from Rhode Island.
   ``I couldn't let them kill my son and get away with it,''
Viscido said.
   On Oct. 12, 1986, the younger Viscido was beaten and shot in the
head in his Deerfield Beach apartment by two men who came to steal
cocaine, police said. He was buried the day before his 28th
birthday.
   Unlike many parents of murdered children, Viscido, a used-car
dealer who had leased out his car lot, had both the money and the
time to pursue the case after the official investigation bogged
down.
   His surveillance and interviews took him as far away as Canada,
New York, and Ohio. His information helped build a 1,300-page file
and led last September to the indictments of Peter Dallas, Carl
Stephen Rosati and Phillip Roussonicolos.
   During a recent interview at his Pompano Beach home, Viscido,
59, said avenging his son's death became an obsession. Depressed
and frustrated after the slaying, he resumed smoking, after
quitting 10 years ago.
   ``I felt I had three choices: I was either going to get killed,
die of a broken heart or get enough evidenc to bring them to
justice,'' Viscido said.
   The younger Viscido worked in the body shop of his father's
used-car lot and dabbled in construction. But his life took a
dangerous turn when he began using drugs and selling them to his
friends, his father recalled.
   Viscido began his probe by talking to his son's friends. Several
weeks after the murder, police gave him composite sketches of the
gunmen.
   Viscido won't divulge many details of his tactics because the
case awaits trial.
   However, he said police put a hidden microphone on him several
times when he met with potential suspects or witnesses. Other times
he took notes, which filled four notebooks. ``As I went along I got
more professional,'' he said.
   When the case first came before a Broward grand jury in early
1989, no indictment was returned. But a second proceeding resulted
in murder and robbery indictments against Rosati, 30; Dallas, 27;
and Roussonicolos, 29.
   Dallas and Roussonicolos are in the Broward County Jail without
bond, while Rosati is fighting extradition from Rhode Island.
   Roussonicolos set up the robbery and Dallas and Rosati were the
gunmen, police alleged.
   Police and prosecutors give Viscido credit for cracking the
case. ``He had perseverance beyond belief,'' said Sgt. Bill Murray
of the Broward Sheriff's Office.
   However, Fort Lauderdale attorney John Howes, who is defending
Roussonicolos, said prosecutors have a case only ``because the
boy's father goes out and tape records conversations, which he
probably doesn't have a right to do.''
   Viscido and attorneys refused to say what the tapes contained.
   Viscido, who spent about $50,000 on the investigation, is
writing a book about it. He encourages victims' families to help
police, even when things seem bleak.
   ``For a while there I didn't think I could make it,'' Viscido
said. ``I now have peace of mind knowing ... that they're going to
pay.''

<HEAD>Israel Removes Harvard Scholar from Scrolls Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel today announced it has fired the
American academic who led an effort to translate the Dead Sea
Scrolls, the oldest known copies of the Old Testment. The decision
came after the professor made anti-Jewish remarks.
   The announcement cited ``health reasons'' for removal of Harvard
University professor John Strugnell from the project, but the
60-year-old scholar has been sharply criticized for an interview
containing anti-Jewish remarks published in November in the Hebrew
daily Haaretz.
   The project also had come under increasing fire for the slowness
with which the scholars' work is being published.
   Strugnell has worked on the scrolls for more than three decades
and has been editor of the scrolls project since 1987. Earlier in
December, other scholars working on the project voted to have him
replaced.
   The scrolls, some of which date to 100 B.C., were found starting
in 1947 in caves near the Dead Sea. They contain the oldest known
copies of the Old Testament, other biblical writings, ancient
literature and poetry.
   In his announcement Monday, Amir Drori, the director of the
Israel Antiquities Authority, said Strugnell was being relieved at
the suggestion of the agency's three-man Scrolls Advisory
Committee.
   Strugnell, who has been in ill health, was reported hospitalized
in the United States.
   Drori said the remaining manuscripts would be edited by Emanuel
Tov, an Israeli named to work with Strugnell in October. Tov, a
professor at Hebrew University, is on a sabbatical in the
Netherlands and could not be reached for comment.
   Magen Broshi, who is one of the members of the advisory
committee, estimated that about 80 percent of the scrolls have been
published and that what remains is complicated because it requires
piecing together thousands of fragments.
   Still, he said, Strugnell before his removal had agreed to a
timetable that should see the remaining documents published by
1997.
   Broshi is curator of the Israel Museum's Shrine of the book,
where eight scrolls are displayed. The remainder are in the
Rockefeller Museum.
   In the interview published Nov. 9 in Haaretz, Strugnell, who is
Roman Catholic, described Judaism as ``a Christian heresy'' and
suggested that its adherents should convert.

   Iraq today ordered 17-year-old males to report for military duty
in the fourth major callup of reserves in recent weeks. European
officials said a meeting with Iraq's foreign minister might be in
the works.
   Saddam Hussein, in a New Year's message, condemned the United
States and Saudi Arabia, where most of the multinational forces
massed against him are deployed.
   ``In this confrontation, there have been those who betrayed
Jesus Christ and who betrayed the principles and values of Islam,
one luring and leading the other,'' the Iraqi president said. `May
God curse them all.''
   Saddam's 15-minute message was carried Sunday on CNN, which
provided English subtitles.
   In Saudi Arabia, Vice President Dan Quayle today told Marines
near the Kuwaiti border that ``you have been patient enough and so
has President Bush'' in waiting for a peaceful solution.
   ``The fact is that a policy of indefinite patience only could
lead to a policy of appeasement,'' which would make Saddam the
victor in the gulf standoff, Quayle told the Marines.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. The United Nations has set a Jan.
15 deadline for Iraq to withdraw from the emirate or face possible
military action.
   Quayle, who arrived in the region Sunday, pressed Saudi Arabia's
King Fahd for more financial support for the U.S. military buildup.
Following Quayle's meeting with Fahd late Sunday, a U.S. official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said there ``seems to be no
problem'' on the issue.
   On the diplomatic front, there was a flurry of European
activity. European Community foreign ministers announced plans to
meet Friday in Luxembourg in an emergency session on the gulf
crisis.
   Yugoslavia's foreign minister, Budimir Loncar, conferred by
telephone with his Italian and German counterparts today, a day
after meeting in Baghdad with Saddam, the Yugoslav news agency
Tanjug reported.
   Diplomats and news reports said the Iraqi president rejected an
appeal by Loncar on behalf of the non-aligned movement to withdraw
from Kuwait.
   But Loncar was also quoted as saying he believed Saddam was
interested in dialogue aimed at achieving a peaceful solution.
   Luxembourg's foreign minister, Jacques Poos, said some states in
the community might well push for a meeting between him and his
Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz. Luxembourg takes over the
community's rotating presidency on Tuesday.
   Poos said he would be ready to go to Baghdad if the foreign
ministers made such a decision Friday. Asked if he thought he would
be meeting Aziz in the near future, he replied: ``Yes, I think
so.''
   The community canceled a meeting with Aziz earlier this month
after the United States and Iraq failed to agree on dates for
direct talks.
   Poos said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. he
expected there would be contact with Iraq either ``through
diplomatic channels or a private talk.''
   In Bonn, German officials speaking on condition of anonymity
also speculated that European Community foreign ministers would
discuss opening ``indirect talks'' with Iraq.
   However, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jacques Santer said today his
country would not suggest any new EC peace initiative. He said the
meeting should reaffirm the EC solidarity with the international
community against the invasion. Luxembourg takes over the
community's rotating presidency on Tuesday.
   Iraq's order for 17-year-old males to report for military duty
came amid escalating preparations for war. The announcement,
carried by the official Iraqi News Agency and Baghdad Radio,
threatened those who fail to respond to the callup with unspecified
``legal action.''
   Also today, Iraqi officials disclosed that 10 civil defense
drills were conducted sucessfully in recent days in the northern
Duhok province along the border with Turkey.
   The province's chief civil defense officer told the government
newspaper Al-Thawra that the drills were aimed at ``preparing the
population for war, air raids and mass-destruction weapons.''
   In other developments:
   -Iran's spiritual leader today called the presence of U.S.
troops in the gulf an ``aggression'' and said countries in the
region would united against them.
   ``The Americans must know that the Islamic countries and world
nations are disgusted with and deplore their presence in the
Persian Gulf,'' said Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in comments reported
by the official Islamic Republic News Agency and monitored in
Nicosia, Cyprus. ``All Americans and their allies must know that
the nations of the region will break the legs of each single
aggressor.'' -Iraq's health minister claimed today that more than
4,200 people, about half of them children under 5 years old, have
died because of shortages in medical supplies brought on by a U.N.
embargo. The minister, Abdul-Salam Mohammed Said, accused the
United States of ``criminal action'' in enforcing the economic
embargo.
   Western officials have in the past expressed skepticism about
similar Iraqi claims. The embargo allows for humanitarian
shipments.
   -A U.S. Marine died from an accidental gunshot wound inflicted
when another Marine's M-16 rifle discharged, U.S. military
officials said today. The shooting, which occurred Saturday, is
being investigated. The Marine was a member of the 3rd Battalion,
3rd Marine Regiment. He was not identified.
   The death brought the number of U.S. servicemen who have died in
Operation Desert Shield to 82.

   Here is a brief look at the latest developments in the Persian
Gulf Crisis:
   ---
   Iraq on Monday ordered 17-year-old males to report for military
duty in the fourth major callup of reserves in recent weeks. The
order came amid escalating preparations for war. A brief
announcement by the General Mobilization Headquarters instructed
Iraqi men born in 1973 to sign up with the nearest recruitment
center between Jan. 2 and Jan. 10.
   The announcement, carried by the official Iraqi News Agency and
Baghdad Radio, threatened those who fail to respond to the callup
with unspecified ``legal action.''

lead to a policy of appeasement,'' which would make Saddam the
victor in the gulf standoff, Quayle told the Marines.

   Quayle, who arrived in the Gulf region Sunday, pressed Saudi
Arabia's King Fahd for more financial support for the U.S. military
buildup. Following Quayle's meeting with Fahd late Sunday, a U.S.
official said there ``seems to be no problem'' the Saudi government
would contribute more to the military buildup. The official spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The Pentagon has projected the cost of the deployment at $30
billion through the end of 1991, and much higher if there is war.
Saudi Arabia has contributed $9 billion in cash and military
support, and Kuwait has given $2.5 billion, U.S. officials said.

   On Sunday, the European Community decided to call an emergency
meeting of its 12 foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Friday. The EC
initiative was proposed Saturday by the German foreign minister,
Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   Luxembourg takes over the EC's presidency on Tuesday and its
foreign minister, Jacques Poos, said some states in the community
might well push for a meeting between him and his Iraqi
counterpart, Tariq Aziz.
   ---
   Luxembourg Prime Minister Jacques Santer said on Monday his
country would not suggest any new EC peace initiative. He said the
meeting should reaffirm the EC solidarity with the international
community against the invasion.

   Wind gusts damaged a passenger jet and a cargo
building at Logan International Airport this morning, forcing at
least one flight to be canceled and a terminal gateway to be
closed.
   No injuries were reported.
   An unoccupied USAir 737-200 was pushed against a jetway in the
incident, which occurred at about 4 a.m., said airline spokeswoman
Susan Young.
   The leading edge of a wing was damaged, forcing USAir to take it
out of service for at least a day and cancel an early-morning
flight to Charlotte, N.C. The jetway, at Gate 8 of the terminal
building, also was damaged and the gate was shut down, Young said.
   The airport authority said there was also damage to the roof of
a freight and cargo building owned by the Hill Management Co.
Company officials were inspecting the building, which is near the
airport's Hilton Hotel, and were not available for comment.
   The wind cracked a window at the National Car Rental car-return
building, and three cars had broken windshields, said John Grasso,
a National spokesman. He estimated the damage at about $700.
   The National Weather Service reported wind gusts of 50 mph in
the area at the time.

<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli planes bombed a PLO guerrilla base
near Sidon early today, killing all 12 of the fighters manning it,
police and the PLO said. It was the highest death toll in 21 such
attacks this year.
   The police report said the jets destroyed a one-story base
belonging to Yasser Arafat's Fatah, the Palestine Liberation
Organization's largest faction.
   The base was in a lemon grove 7{ miles southeast of Sidon, a
southern port city that is the Palestinians' main stronghold in
Lebanon.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military command said its planes
returned safely to base after hitting ``a launching pad for attacks
on Israel.''
   The air raid came a day after Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets
landed in Israel's self-designated security zone and across the
border in northern Israel. The rockets caused no damage or
injuries.
   Police and the PLO confirmed in separate statements that all the
guerrillas were killed.
   ``There were no survivors. Those dug out alive died in
ambulances before reaching hospital,'' a police spokesman said. He
could not be named in line with standing rules.
   Police say 28 people were killed and 82 wounded in the 20
previous Israel raids into Lebanon this year.
   A PLO military communique issued in Tunis and sent to The
Associated Press claimed the raid was part of a ``massive military
operation'' Israel was planning in southern Lebanon.
   It said Israel pushed troop reinforcements ``estimated at two
brigades'' into its self-designated security zone in southern
Lebanon three days ago, but gave no other details.
   The reported buildup could not be independently confirmed.
   Fatah, the largest and oldest of nine groups under the PLO,
marks the 26th anniversary of its foundation on Tuesday.
   Israel created the security zone in 1985 when it withdrew the
bulk of its forces from Lebanon, ending a three-year occupation.

   Flooding caused by a weekend of rain and melting snow kept
hundreds of people out of their homes today in the Ohio River
Valley.
   A canoeist drowned in a flooded stream in Pennsylvania. About
100 deaths have been blamed on the weather since Dec. 18.
   Nearly every major stream in Indiana was flooding today and more
than 1,000 people had fled their homes statewide. No injuries were
reported there.
   About 450 people had fled their homes in western Pennsylvania.
   Flooding was occurring along every major river in Indiana, said
Al Shipe, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service in
Indianapolis. ``We'll be having a major flood on all of them. For
the extensiveness, this is extremely unusual,'' Shipe said this
morning.
   People had been evacuated in 17 of Indiana's 92 counties since
Saturday and high water closed roads in at least 50 counties,
authorities said.
   Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh issued a special directive Sunday night
placing the National Guard on alert and ordering guardsmen to make
armories available to flood evacuees.
   ``We basically have more locations where we have high water than
we have signs to even mark it,'' said Joe Loughmiller of the state
Department of Transportation.
   In western Pennsylvania, gauges at Greater Pittsburgh
International Airport measured a record 2.49 inches of rain Sunday,
pushing the month's rainfall to 8.24 inches, 2 inches greater than
the previous record.
   The record-busting rainfall forced 450 people from their homes
in Allegheny, Beaver and Butler counties because of high water.
Emergency officials said most turned to relatives or friends and
some spent the night in shelters at schools or volunteer fire
departments.
   Some evacuees were allowed to return home today in parts of Ohio
as rain ended or turned to snow.
   In LaRue in north-central Ohio, about 40 residents of a senior
citizens' home were evacuated Sunday night after the Scioto River
overran its banks, Mayor Kelly Davids said.
   In the Cleveland suburb of Valley View, about 75 people who were
evacuated from their homes Sunday were still not permitted to
return early today, said Fire Chief Joe Sway.
   ``The water has been receding, probably by 6 feet, but a good
deal of the village is still impassable,'' Sway said. ``Plus,
there's a freezing problem now, a coating of ice in some places.''
   Streams also overflowed in parts of West Virginia but few
evacuations were reported.

<TEXT>
   Texas House Speaker Gib Lewis, indicted on
two misdemeanor ethics charges, was booked today and released on
his own recognizance, authorities said.
   Sgt. James Johnson of the sheriff's department said Lewis turned
himself in at the Travis County jail about 7:30 a.m. and was
released 20 minutes later.
   Glenn Smith, a publicist working for Lewis, said the speaker had
no immediate comment but might issue a statement later in the day.
   Lewis, a Democrat from Fort Worth, was indicted Friday by a
Travis County grand jury on misdemeanor charges. He is accused of
receiving a gift from a San Antonio law firm, Heard, Goggan Blair &amp;
Williams, and not reporting report the benefit on his public
financial disclosure statement.
   The charges stem from a tax payment made by the law firm for
business taxes owed by Lewis, said Travis County District Attorney
Ronnie Earle.
   The booking was ``rather a quick process,'' said Sheriff's Capt.
Melissa Caldwell. She said Lewis was wearing a suit and tie and
accompanied by three other people.
   Lewis' attorneys claim the indictments were politically
motivated and said earlier that he would plead innocent. If
convicted on the two counts, Lewis faces a maximum of 18 months in
jail and $3,000 in fines.
   The grand jury investigation is continuing, and Earle says it
has expanded to include more legislators and lobbyists.
   Lewis said he plans to seek an unprecedented fifth two-year term
as speaker when the 1991 Legislature convenes on Jan. 8.
   On Sunday, The Dallas Morning News reported that Lewis shared an
$800-a-night hotel suite with a 24-year-old receptionist from Heard
Goggan during a Mexican vacation paid for the firm.
   Lewis and Toni Barcellona, a former receptionist for the law
firm who is now a lobbyist, were among six men and six women who
spent three days together in April 1987 at a resort near Acapulco,
Mexico, the paper said.
   The newspaper said it gleaned details of the trip from
interviews with people who went along and with some people who have
been questioned by the Travis County grand jury.

   The Christmas tree in London's Trafalgar Square
was attacked with a chainsaw early today, hours before the 100-foot
Norwegian fir was to be the centerpiece of a huge New Year's party
on the square.
   The attacker was arrested and jailed. He told police the attack
on the tree, a gift from Norway, was a protest of Norway's legal
system.
   Tree surgeons announced they had managed to save the tree. They
lifted the fir by crane and trimmed damaged parts of the trunk,
police said. It had now been restored to its usual position, police
said.
   Magistrates at London's Bow Street court jailed Patrick
Harwood-Duffy, 36, of Brixton, south London, for four months after
he admitted causing criminal damage estimated at $6,100 to the
tree.
   Harwood-Duffy told police he was protesting against the
``unfairness'' of Norway's legal system, where he served a jail
term for heroin smuggling.
   His lawyer, John Hardy, said Harwood-Duffy was frustrated by the
long delay before his case was heard. He had been released in
August after 11 months in solitary confinement, Hardy said.
   Scotland Yard said Harwood-Duffy jumped over barriers around the
tree early today and managed to saw a good way through the trunk.
Police at first thought it may have to be scrapped.
   The tree, which stands in the square through Christmas and New
Year, was under police guard today in advance of the raucous street
party traditionally staged in Trafalgar Square on New Year's Eve.
   A tree is shipped annually from Norway as a gift to the British
people for their efforts in World War II to defeat the Germans, who
had invaded and occupied Norway.

<TEXT>
   Heavy fighting broke out today in
Mogadishu, the capital of the east African nation of Somalia, and
there were conflicting reports over who was in control of the city.
   Rebels claimed to have seized the presidential palace and nearly
all of the city, but said there were still ``pockets of
resistance'' around the capital, according to the Italian news
agency Ansa.
   But a diplomat contacted by telephone from Rome said the palace
was still in the hands of the government forces. The diplomat said
there was fighting in the city center with bazookas, mortar fire
and light cannon. He said there had been casualties, but did not
have a figure.
   The diplomat also said Prime Minister Mohamed Hawadleh Madhar
had made a radio appeal for government forces to retreat to their
barracks.
   In Washington, a senior State Department official described the
situation in the capital as ``very fluid.''
   ``I don't think anybody controls anything. Nobody really knows
who controls what,'' the U.S. official said on condition of
anonymity.
   He added the government's control of the country has been very
tenuous for some time. Most official Americans have long since left
the country as a precautionary measure, leaving the U.S. Embassy
operating with a very small staff. The official said fighting
appeared to have subsided by the evening.
   Earlier today, a group representing more than 100 leading Somali
dissidents and former politicians called for a cease-fire and the
formation of an interim government, according to the BBC.
   The dissidents, calling themselves the Manifesto Group, called
for the army to be confined to barracks and for the rebels to lay
down their arms, the BBC reported.
   Somalia's President Mohamed Siad Barre, who is normally under
heavy guard by an elite unit of fanatically loyal soldiers, was
holed up in a bunker at the international airport, according to the
Mogadishu-based diplomat and other sources.
   The rebels claimed to have taken control of large areas around
the airport, according to Ansa.
   The BBC reported that today fighting was a continuation of
battles that broke out Sunday after armed attackers broke into a
warehouse and killed a senior army officer. t least 20 people were
killed Sunday and more than 50 wounded, according to the BBC.
   Shooting was heard throughout the night in Mogadishu and machine
gun and rocket-propelled grenade fire could be heard during the
day, according to sources in Nairobi, the capital of neighboring
Kenya, and the BBC.
   The BBC reported artillery fire could be heard around the
presidential palace.
   The diplomatic sources were in sporadic contact by
radiotelephone with their embassies and offices in the Somali
capital. Regular telephone and telex lines were not working.
   Gunbattles have been reported in Mogadishu almost every day for
the past two weeks, and most aid organizations and Western
embassies have withdrawn all but essential staff because of the
accelerating breakdown in order.
   The United Somali Congress, a recently formed group which
springs from the large, central Hawiye clan, were reportedly
fighting within 30 miles of the capital. However, rebel supporters
and representatives could be found in Mogadishu, according to
recent visitors.
   In addition to the United Somali Congress, Siad Barre is
challenged in the north by the more established Somali National
Movement, which draws its strenth from the Isaaq clan. It has been
fighting since 1982 for the removal of Siad Barre, a member of the
Marehan clan who seized power in a bloodless 1969 coup.
   The rebel groups are loosely coordinated. They have twice
rejected government calls for negotiations in the past month,
saying they prefer to remove Siad Barre at gunpoint.
   The United States has been Siad Barre's strongest ally since the
late 1970s.
   In recent years, major human rights organizations have
increasingly accused Siad Barre's government of a long list of
abuses, including massacres, torture, imprisonment of political
prisoners without charge or trial and corruption.
   Somalia, which had been colonized in the north by the British
and in the south by Italy, became independent and united in 1960.

   Carbon dioxide gas leaked from a truck
Monday in a busy industrial zone, injuring 18 people, police and a
hospital official said.
   Ahuva Ivri, a city police spokeswoman, said the non-toxic gas
apparently seeped out of a valve on the vehicle, which was parked
in the Nahlat Yitzhak Quarter.
   Police had not determined whether the leak was accidental, Ivri
said.
   Streets in the area were blocked off, tying up traffic in the
heart of Israel's business capital, Israeli radio said.
   Dr. Bianca Lederman of Ichilov Hospital said 15 people were
admitted suffered slight breathing difficulties and three others
were in moderate condition. All were treated with oxygen masks, she
said on Army radio.
   Ms. Lederman said the gas was expected to evaporate near the
site of the leak without causing further injury.

   Three federal police agents have
been arrested in the slaying of a Greek shipping executive, major
newspapers reported Monday.
   ``It was not the federal police who committed this crime but
bandits, cancerous cells that infiltrated the force,'' federal
police director Romeu Tuma told the daily newspaper Rio de Janeiro.
   Tuma said a 9mm pistol, believed to be the murder weapon, and
nearly $20,000 of up to $80,000 stolen from the victim had been

   Konstadinos Petychakis, a representative for the Greek company
Tsakos Shipping and Trading, was found shot to death on Dec. 20,
two hours after he was seen getting into a federal police car at
Galeao International Airport, authorities say.
   His bullet-ridden body was found in a field near a road from the
airport to downtown Rio.
   Petychakis had arrived from neighboring Uruguay with a briefcase
full of cash to pay the crew of a tanker leased to the state oil
monopoly Petrobras.

<HEAD>Economic Slowdown Could Cost An Additional 1 Million Jobs in 1991</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New Year will bring tough economic times,
according to many forecasters who say 1991 will begin with America
in a mild recession that could cost an additional 1 million jobs.
   Inflation will moderate somewhat in 1991 according to these
estimates, and interest rates for mortgages, car loans and other
purchases should drift downward in the coming months.
   These economic forecasters express optimism that the recession
could end sometime in midyear, in part because of expanded export
sales and improvements in the housing industry. But there's a
catch: a war in the Persian Gulf that damages oil production
facilities could lead to a deeper, more severe downturn.
   ``Anything that gets the crisis over with in a hurry, whether it
is a quick war or a quick peace, helps the economy,'' said David
Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill Inc.
   ``But if the crisis drags out and it keeps oil prices high and
consumer confidence low, then that will make the recession worse.''
   Other dangers could scuttle hopes that the recession will be a
brief one, ranging from the huge consumer, business and government
debt left over from the 1980s to signs of serious weakness in the
nation's banking system.
   And the most recent indicators are discouraging. The government
announced on Friday that its chief economic forecasting gauge, the
Index of Leading Indicators, fell 1.2 percent in November for the
fifth monthly drop in a row.
   ``The basic message is there's no light down there in the tunnel
that we can see,'' said economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern
Trust Co. in Chicago. ``The recession is clearly in place and
clearly has further to go.''
   Not everyone is as pessimistic.
   ``There is a list of risks to the forecast as far as the eye can
see,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``But
the most optimistic prospect is that by midyear some sort of
recovery will be emerging.''
   ``By this time next year, I believe we will all feel a little
better about our economic opportunities and the pessimism that
seems pervasive now will be a distant memory,'' said Mark Zandi, an
economist with Regional Financial Associates of West Chester, Pa.
   For the record, the arbiter of recessions, the National Bureau
of Economic Research, has not officially declared that the country
is in a downturn but the group of distinguished academics has come
awfully close.
   In a statement released last week, they said it was likely that
the bureau would end up pinpointing a month between June and
September as the start of the country's ninth recession since the
end of World War II. However, the panel said that it did not have
enough information yet to make such a call and would meet again
after Jan. 25.
   That is the date the Commerce Department releases its first look
at overall economic activity in the quarter from October through
December.
   Many economists believe the report will show the gross national
product declined sharply during this period.
   The general definition of a recession is two consecutive
quarters of declining GNP.
   While the Bush administration has yet to use the word recession,
it too is inching closer. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady has
talked of a serious slowdown in the fourth quarter and said there
was a possibility that the weakness would continue into the first
three months of 1991.
   Following is a look at how analysts believe a variety of
economic barometers will perform in 1991:
   -GNP: Estimates on the amount that the total output of goods and
services will shrink during the recession range from less than 0.6
percent to above 2 percent. The average drop in output in the eight
previous post-World War II recessions is 2.6 percent. Given the
fact that analysts believe there will be a rebound in the second
half of 1991, they are forecasting a modest GNP increase of around
0.4 percent for the year as a whole.
   -UNEMPLOYMENT: The jobless rate, which had fallen as low as 5.2
percent earlier in 1990, rose to 5.9 percent in November as the
economic slowdown showed up in layoffs and production cutbacks.
Analysts predicted that the unemployment rate would rise to around
7 percent before beginning to improve. Each percentage point
increase in the jobless rate translates into about 1 million more
people out of work.
   -INFLATION: The one bright spot for 1991 is the widespread
belief that consumer prices, which shot up at an annual rate of 6.4
percent in the first 11 months of 1990, will moderate. Many
forecasters are predicting the Consumer Price Index will rise less
than 4 percent in 1991 although they caution that this prediction
is based on an assumption that the Persian Gulf crisis will be
resolved without pushing oil prices higher for a sustained period.
   -INTEREST RATES: The Federal Reserve, which has already pushed
short-term interest rates down by a full percentage point in the
past two months, will keep lowering rates to rekindle economic
growth. Sinai said he was looking for banks' prime rate, the
benchmark rate for many business and consumer loans, to be around
8.5 percent by next summer. The prime rate at many banks is
currently 10 percent. Analysts were also forecasting that mortgage
rates, currently at 9.6 percent for fixed-rate loans, will drop as
low as 9 percent next year.

   President Bush plans to spend a quiet New
Year's Eve with his wife, his daughter and two grandchildren at
Camp David, the White House said Monday.
   The Bushes have not invited any outsiders to ring in 1991 at the
presidential retreat in the Cacoctin Mountains of Maryland about 60
miles from here, aides said.
   The president went to Camp David before Christmas. He has
remained there throughout the holidays, coming back to Washington
only for one day to handle paperwork. Bush plans to return to the
White House Tuesday.
   Aides said they had no idea whether Bush would stay up for
midnight.
   Joining Bush for New Year's Eve are First Lady Barbara Bush,
Dorothy Bush LeBlond, his daughter, and her two children, Sam, 6,
and Ellen, 4. Dorothy LeBlond is divorced from her husband.
   Bush's four sons were with the family for Christmas, but have
left Camp David.
   Bush's low-key New Year's Eve is a sharp contrast from the
annual party that former President Reagan attended in Palm Springs,
Calif. The celebrity-studded event was hosted by publisher Walter
Annenberg.

   The Scots dined on haggis, the
French had foie gras and the Americans enjoyed steak and a radio
special by comedian Robin Williams. But New Year's celebrations for
the gulf troops were generally low-key.
   The important date for the troops is Jan. 15, the U.N. deadline
for Iraq to get out of Kuwait or face a possible military strike to
drive it from the emirate.
   Although soldiers yearned for a cup of kindness, New Year's was
non-alcoholic because of Saudi Arabia's strict Muslim ban on
liquor.
   ``There's no booze. What are you going to do? Have another
Coke?'' said Marine Col. M.L. Haiman, 49, of the Bronx, New York.
``People have their eye on the 15th of January.''
   The troops in the multinational force have been on heightened
alert throughout the holidays in case Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein launches a pre-emptive strike.
   ``It's a prime time for the other side to come after us, on our
holidays when they think our guard might slip. If they think that,
they're wrong,'' said Haiman.
   The only official celebrations were by the approximately 3,000
men of the Scottish regiments in the British 1st Armored Division,
made up of the 4th Armored Brigade and the 7th Armored Brigade, the
famed Desert Rats.
   ``All the Scots will want to celebrate Hogmanay,'' said division
spokesman Capt. James Myles, using the Scottish term for the
holiday.
   The Scots ate a traditional meal of haggis and mashed turnips,
ushered into the camps by bagpipes. Haggis is made of the heart,
liver and lungs of a sheep or calf, and minced with onions, oatmeal
and boiled in the stomach of an animal.
   The 6,000 French troops toasted with ``Saudi champagne'' - a
mixture of apple juice and Perrier.
   ``Our own costs a lot more, but for that we'll have to wait for
our return,'' said Adjutant Robert Simon, spokesman for the French
forces.
   Special food like chocolate and foie gras - duck liver pate -
had been flown in from France, he said.
   Many U.S. troops said they had not even thought about the
holiday due to their fierce training schedules, but there were some
small celebrations.
   Many units barbecued steaks left over from Christmas.
   ``I'm going to get myself a six-pack of near-beer and have a
near-party and sit around and play some cards,'' said Staff Sgt.
David Hebert, 30, of Brickton, N.J., in the 3rd Platoon of the
Army's 595th Medical Company.
   Many troops planned to tune in to a Robin William's special,
pre-recorded for the Armed Forces Radio Network.
   Williams, re-enacting his radio role of Adrian Kronauer in the
film ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' yelled, ``Good Maaawwwrning,
Saaauuudi'' and then told jokes like, ``Is it just me, or does
Yasser Arafat look like Ringo Starr?''
   While Saudis educated in the West tend to celebrate New Year's
with private parties at home, as do foreigners living here, it's
not an official Moslem holiday
   The Muslims follow a lunar calendar and their new year marks the
date when the prophet Mohammed, founder of the faith, emigrated in
the 7th century from Mecca to Medina, both now holy shrines in
Saudi Arabia. Their new year falls on July 12, 1991, on the
Christian calendar.
   There was one almost universal New Year's resolution among the
troops.
   ``They're all the same. I know what they all are: To leave and
go home,'' said Staff Sgt. Johnnie Montgomery, 27, of Annaston,
Ala., of the 96th Civil Affairs Battalion.

<HEAD>Steps Taken To Speed Extradition Of Supremacist Charged with Evers
Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White supremacist Byron De La Beckwith
was arrested for a second time in less than two weeks today on a
warrant stemming from the 1963 slaying of civil rights leader
Medger Evers.
   In a move intended to speed his transfer from Tennessee to
Mississippi, Beckwith, 70, was arrested on a murder warrant, and an
extradition hearing was scheduled for Wednesday.
   He had been arrested Dec. 18 on a fugitive warrant from
Mississippi, where he has twice been tried for the murder of Evers.
The arrests followed a new murder indictment returned by a grand
jury in Hinds County, Miss.
   Evers was field secretary for the NAACP when he was killed by a
sniper's bullet in front of his Jackson, Miss., home on June 12,
1963.
   Both of Beckwith's previous trials were heard by all-white
juries and ended deadlocked. The charges were dropped in 1969 but
the was reopened amid charges of jury and evidence tampering.
   His extradition hearing had been set for Feb. 22, but that was
moved up to Wednesday after extradition papers were signed by Gov.
Ray Mabus of Mississippi and Gov. Ned McWherter of Tennessee.
   Hamilton County Detective Linda Clark called the matter ``one of
the fastest extradition proceedings on record.'' Beckwith is due to
appear Wednesday before Criminal Court Judge Joe DeRisio in
Chattanooga.
   Beckwith had been free on bond pending an extradition hearing.
No bond was set for Beckwith when he was arrested today.
   Beckwith has vowed to fight extradition, calling the new charges
``nonsense, poppycock and just something to stir the people up.''

<HEAD>Israel Bombs PLO Bases, 12 Guerrillas Killed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AHMED MANTASH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel unleashed its deadliest air attack
of the year on Lebanon Monday, killing 12 PLO guerrillas in a
predawn raid near Sidon.
   Police and the Palestine Liberation Organization confirmed in
separate statements that there were no survivors among Yasser
Arafat's Fatah guerrillas at the base.
   The Lebanese police report said two F-15 fighter-bombers struck
20 minutes past midnight Sunday. They dropped two 1,500-pound bombs
that flattened the two-story villa occupied by the guerrillas.
   It was Israel's 21st raid on Lebanon this year. The Israeli
command said its planes returned safely after hitting ``a launching
pad for attacks on Israel.''
   Fatah, the largest and oldest of nine groups under the PLO,
marks the 26th anniversary of its founding on Tuesday, New Year's
Day.
   The base was in a lemon grove 7{ miles southeast of Sidon, a
police spokesman said.
   ``There were no survivors. Those who were dug out from the
rubble alive died in ambulances before reaching hospital,'' the
spokesman said. He could not be identified in line with standing
rules.
   A PLO statement issued in Sidon said the bodies of all 12 Fatah
fighters were recovered before bulldozers were brought in to clear
the rubble.
   Guerrillas dispatched from Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp
looked through the debris for hours to salvage weapons and
ammunition from the destroyed base.
   ``It was a disaster. Our comrades were caught unawares,'' one
guerrilla told reporters. He refused to give his name.
   By police count, 28 people were killed and 82 wounded in the 20
previous strikes this year. The heaviest death toll came in a
strike on Arpil 20, when six guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
fundemantalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, were killed.
   A PLO communique telefaxed to The Associated Press in Nicosia,
Cyprus, warned that Israel was preparing for a ``massive military
operation'' in southern Lebanon.
   The communique claimed Israel pushed troop reinforcements
``estimated at two brigades'' into its self-designated ``security
zone'' in southern Lebanon three days ago.
   But security sources in the region said there were no abnormal
Israeli military movements in the zone. They also claimed that no
surface-to-surface missiles were deployed in the zone or elsewhere
in south Lebanon.
   Israel carved out the zone in 1985, when it withdrew the bulk of
its invading forces from Lebanon, ending a three-year occupation.
   The enclave covers 440 square miles from the Mediterranean coast
to the foothills of Mount Hermon.
   Western military sources say that about 6,000 PLO guerrillas are
based in and around Sidon, the provincial capital of southern
Lebanon 25 miles south of Beirut.

<HEAD>San Diego Zoo's Official Greeter For 64 Years Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Tut, a grand-old cockatoo that greeted
millions of visitors to the San Diego Zoo during the bird's 64
years as official greeter, has died.
   King Tut was at least 67 years old, spokesman Jeff Jouett said.
   The salmon-crested bird had fallen from its perch and was found
Sunday after zookeepers heard odd squawking noises from the bird
yard, Jouett said.
   Veterinarians tried to revive the male bird with oxygen and
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   It was donated to the zoo in 1925 and was named King Tut because
its arrival came shortly after the discovery of King Tutankhamen's
tomb in Egypt.
   The bird delighted more than 100 million zoo visitors from his
perch next to the flamingo lagoon with antics that included
whistling and imitations of crying babies, meowing cats, clucking
chickens and other species of birds.
   It also appeared in motion pictures and television shows,
including an early episode of ``The Mickey Mouse Club.''
   Bothered by arthritis and cataracts in both eyes, King Tut was
retired from the greeters' perch just inside the entrance in June
1989. It was then moved to the education department and appeared at
special events, school programs and zoo tours.
   The life expectancy of cockatoos generally is three to four
decades, said Jouett. Some have lived into their 60s, and Jouett
knows of one that was in its 80s before dying.

   A scaffolding collapsed this morning inside a
huge boiler at a Staten Island power plant, injuring 10 workers
including one who was trapped in debris nearly 2{ hours,
authorities said.
   Marty Gitten, a spokesman for Consolidated Edison, said the
scaffolding partially collapsed shortly after 10 a.m. The men were
working inside a boiler that was being overhauled at the utility's
Arthur Kill 3 generating unit, he said.
   The fire department put the height of the scaffolding at more
than 100 feet.
   Tom Kelly, a fire department spokesman, said the last worker to
be rescued was pulled out at 12:30 p.m.
   ``He's conscious, talking and being evaluated,'' Kelly said.
   Of the 10 workers, at least two were seriously injured, the
city's Emergency Medical Service said.
   Gitten said it was not immediately apparent what caused the
accident at the plant, which is located on the western side of the
island.

   They are homeless, but three couples and a man
they took in have made a home out of a ramshackle camp on an unused
railroad track.
   Every day, Reggie and Isabelle Evon, Jeannette and Donald
Benson, Jimmy and Terri Kelly and Eugene Sullivan laugh, talk, eat
and argue together. And in a world that seems not to care for them,
they care for each other, like a family.
   ``We're homeless but we're not homeless,'' said Evon, the
group's informal leader. ``Once in awhile we have arguments, but
everybody has a good time here.''
   They have held jobs and lived ``normal'' lives in the past. But
somewhere along the line a job was lost or the rent was raised, and
they found themselves on the streets.
   But while they want to return to their old lives, they'll choose
an independent life in the camp over a homeless shelter any day.
   ``I've had it with shelters,'' said Ms. Benson, 44. ``You have
no privacy there. They go through your personal belongings, or they
throw your stuff out. Here I don't have to go to bed at 9 o'clock
like a little kid.''
   The camp sits in a ravine at the end of an unused Conrail track.
Planted squarely on the track is the Evons' house, a large plywood
shack that Evon built with scrap supplies. Sullivan and the other
couples live in more modest tents. And there are 14 stray dogs and
cats.
   The group is bound by ties of family and marriage, and by the
solidarity born of life on the streets.
   Isabelle Evon, 32, and Terri Kelly, 31, are sisters who grew up
in Boston. Both had several husbands before meeting Reggie and
Jimmy.
   Reggie Evon, 37, was a truck driver before coming to Boston from
Colorado four years ago. Jimmy Kelly, 35, came from Oklahoma City
to be a house painter. But there was never enough work.
   Along the way they met Jeannette and Donald Benson, 46, from
Malden, who have worked odd jobs and been in and out of shelters
together for years.
   Sullivan joined the group when Evon found him sleeping under a
bridge on a rainy day.
   ``He was shivering real bad, and I said, `Come on over,''' Evon
said.
   Sullivan, in his 50s, came to Boston from Tennessee 15 years
ago. He married, had several children and was divorced. He has been
on the streets since 1987.
   Some go out ``canning'' - collecting recyclable aluminum cans
for the deposit money. Evon does odd jobs at a nearby produce
market for food, and Kelly sometimes finds work in day labor pools.
Meals can be found at soup kitchens and shelters.
   ``I get up, grab a bite to eat and go canning. Then I come back
and argue with everybody,'' Kelly said, laughing.
   ``It's tough in the winter; you wake up in the morning and the
water is ice,'' he added. ``But I can get showers at friends'
houses. And the labor pools keep me in beer and cigarette money.''
   The source of their troubles is not just economic. Kelly said he
has had run-ins with the law. A psychiatrist told Ms. Benson she is
chronically depressed. Benson drinks cheap wine before noon.
   Joking and laughter fill the camp. But the veneer of cheeriness
is punctured when a reminder of the past comes flooding in.
   For Ms. Evon, that happens once a week when she and her husband
have a 90-minute visit in a state agency with their two daughters,
ages 1 and 2. The girls were placed in foster care when officials
decided the shack wasn't a home. She lost three other children to
the state in the same way.
   ``I was being discharged from the hospital and they said I
couldn't take my baby home,'' Ms. Evon recalled. ``I started crying
and trying to punch everyone in sight.''
   Without a child to mother, she snuggles one of the skinny
kittens under her coat.
   Sullivan thinks about his old life whenever his daughter visits
him at the camp.
   ``I don't like this life, I didn't want to stay here,'' he said.
``You can't go back, though. You can't walk in looking like a
bum.''

<TEXT>
   Federal authorities investigating alleged
price fixing in the baby formula business have subpoenaed company
records and the files of an infant health group that opposes
formula advertising on grounds it would discourage breast feeding.
   Company officials said Monday the subpoenas were issued by the
Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition.
   Antoinette Parisi Eaton, president of the American Academy of
Pediatrics, said the records subpoenaed from the academy dealt
mainly with its position in opposition to infant formula
advertising.
   ``Breast feeding rates in this country are already going down,''
Ms. Eaton said. ``We have concerns that massive advertising
campaigns promoting infant formula are going to further reduce the
number of women who will consider breast feeding.''
   Debbie Feinstein, assistant to the director of the Bureau of
Competition, said she understands there has been limited
advertising of baby formula, but ``certainly it is not the kind of
thing that you see on TV.''
   ``To the extent that there is any kind of agreement not to
advertise, that would be something that would be a cause for
antitrust concern,'' Ms. Feinstein said.
   ``We are not taking a position on whether or not advertising is
good or bad or infant formula is good or bad, but the things we
have heard are that infant formula is a very concentrated industry
and one of the reasons it might be hard for people to enter is
because there is not any advertising,'' she said.
   Ms. Feinstein said the investigation was launched in late May
after the bureau received price fixing allegations from state
welfare officials and consumer advocates.
   Infant formula is a major ingredient of food packages given to
low-income families who qualify for the Special Supplemental Food
Program for Women, Infants and Children. The federally funded
program, known as WIC, serves about 4.4 million people a month and
accounts for one-third of the infant formula sold in the United
States.
   Kevin J. Arquit, director of the bureau, testified before a
Senate Judiciary subcommittee in May that the agency had received
complaints from state directors of the program about alleged
anti-competitive practices in the industry.
   Company officials testifying before the subcommittee said their
prices are fair.
   Audrey Ashby, a spokesman for Wyeth Ayerst Laboratories, one of
the principal manufacturers of formula, said the company received
the FTC subpoena in September and has begun turning over the
requested documents.
   ``We set prices independently and compete vigorously and
independently in all aspects of the infant formula business,'' Ms.
Ashby said. Wyeth-Ayerst is a division of the American Home
Products Corp.
   According to a story in The New York Times on Monday, records
were also subpoenaed from Ross Laboratories, a division of Abbott
Laboratories; the Mead-Johnson Nutritional Group, a division of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.; the Carnation Co., a subsidiary of Nestle
S.A.; and the Gerber Products Co.
   Officials of some of the companies could not be reached because
of the New Year's holiday, and Ms. Feinstein said the FTC could not
confirm that subpoenas had been issued.
   Mead Johnston, Ross Laboratories and Wyeth Laboratories make
about 90 percent of the infant formula sold in the United States,
according to testimony before the Senate subcommittee. The domestic
market has been estimated at about $1.3 billion a year.
   ``This is a high-priority investigation,'' Ms. Feinstein said.
   She said it was not possible to say how long it could take
before the commission decided whether any price fixing had
occurred.
   Dennis Bach, who heads the WIC program in Iowa and the National
Association of WIC Directors, said, ``Over the last 10 years there
has been a fairly consistent pattern of the major companies
increasing their prices on the average of once a year, often within
a day or two of each other and often by virtually the same
percentage.''
   Bach said the wholesale price of formula had increased by about
150 percent during this period and now stands at around $1.90 for a
13-ounce can of concentrate. He said retail prices vary from 5
cents to 50 cents above that.

   Here is the text of President Bush's
videotaped New Year's greetings to the Soviet people, to be
broadcast on New Year's Day:
   It's a great a pleasure to wish President and Mrs. Gorbachev and
all the peoples of the Soviet Union a happy and healthy New Year.
In your country, and in mine, the start of a New Year is a good
time to reflect on the many achievements of the past and to look
ahead with hope.
   This year our two countries, as well as those around the world,
have much to be grateful for. First and foremost, the improved and
strengthened relations between the United States and the Soviet
Union.
   Our countries have made great progress, particularly in
important political and arms control areas. And we've taken a
common approach to a new challenge in the name of stability and
peace.
   I applaud, the world applauds, the decisive action of the Soviet
Union in strongly opposing Saddam Hussein's brutal aggression in
the Gulf.
   But just as important as these new areas of cooperation between
our two nations are the increased contacts between the Americans
and Soviet peoples. Tens of thousands of Soviets have had contact
with Americans now, and the numbers are growing. Barbara and I are
thrilled to see our two peoples meeting and getting to know one
another as friendly neighbors.
   On this New Year's Day, as you celebrate with your friends and
family, I also want to applaud the Soviet Union for the important
steps you've taken in building a new society, for the determination
with which you are pressing forward with difficult political and
economic reforms. It's an arduous journey, but one well worth
making, for it is a path that leads to a brighter future for your
nation.
   The American people look with hope to the year ahead. Our two
nations have set out on a new course making a better life for both
our peoples and a better world of peace and understanding.
   On behalf of the American people, I wish President Gorbachev and
all the wonderful people of the Soviet Union a happy, prosperous
New Year.''

<TEXT>
   Surprised Greek officials struggled to
put up hundreds of newly arrived Albanian refugees in makeshift
shelters today, and Albanian Jews were arriving in Israel under
relaxed travel restrictions.
   Hundreds more Albanians trekked across frozen mountains and
rivers today in the biggest exodus from their country since its
Communist government promised reforms last summer.
   Military sources in the northwestern Greek border town of
Filiates said today that 632 Albanians, most of them ethnic Greeks,
had crossed the frontier since daybreak.
   On Sunday, at least 500 Albanians arrived in northern Greece
seeking political asylum. In addition, 37 Jews flew to Rome from
the Albanian capital of Tirana en route to Israel.
   So far this month, more than 1,600 people from the tiny Balkan
nation of 3.3 million have fled into Greece across the once tightly
sealed 100-mile frontier.
   Israeli media reported today that four Albanian Jewish families
had arrived in Israel and dozens more were expected in coming
weeks. Israel radio said the Albanian immigration was made possible
by a recent agreement by Italy with Albania, the last of the
hard-line Communist regimes in Eastern Europe.
   But Israeli government officials were tight-lipped about the
immigration of Albanian Jews, apparently fearful of harming the
effort.
   ``This is going to save Albanian Jews from total extinction. Had
they remained there, they would have been wiped out in a
generation,'' said Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum, a consultant to the
American Jewish Committee in New York.
   The Albanian Jewish community numbers only about 1,000,
officials said.
   The arrival of the Albanian Jews comes as Israel struggles to
cope with a huge wave of arriving Soviet Jews.
   Greek officials, too, were overwhelmed by the sudden influx.
   ``It looks like there are whole villages crossing - it's a
madhouse up here,'' said a police spokesman in the Greek border
village of Filiates on Sunday.
   ``Our police station has become a refugee center,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We don't know what to do with
all these people.''
   He said it appeared the Albanian government had opened its
frontier with Greece. ``There can be no other explanation,'' he
said. ``A mosquito couldn't get across the border before.''
   Police have reported that Albanian border guards killed at least
five people trying to cross the frontier in recent weeks.
   Last week, the Greek government charged that Albanians were
murdering many ethnic Greeks who tried to flee.
   Greece claims that more than 350,000 ethnic Greeks live in
southern Albania. The Albanian government says the figure is
60,000.
   The Albanian Jews who left Sunday were the first in a planned
operation dubbed ``Flying Carpet'' to take an estimated 500 Jews
out of Albania, said Shula Bahat, a spokeswoman for the American
Jewish Committee in New York.
   Vladimir Prela, head of the Albanian Foreign Ministry's press
office, said in a telephone interview from Tirana on Sunday that a
new government policy allows anyone to leave Albania if they wish.
   In Israel, army radio quoted a Tel Aviv man who said the entire
Jewish community of Albania was packed and ready to leave for
Israel. He said some of his 60 Albanian relatives had arrived in
Israel over the past two months.
   It said immigrants from Albania had arrived in recent days at an
absorption center in the southern city of Beersheva.
   Tirana newspapers on Sunday published a new draft constitution
that guarantees freedom of movement, as well as freedom of religion
and private ownership, according to Albanian state radio.
   The radio said the draft establishes multiparty elections. Under
the new constitution, the president will be selected by parliament
to serve a five-year term and can only be re-elected once.
Elections are scheduled for Feb. 10.
   Pressures for reform in economically backward Albania began
building on President Ramiz Alia in July when about 5,000 Albanians
sought asylum in embassies in Tirana and were allowed to flee to
Italy.
   An exodus of thousands of East Germans to the West last year
also helped bring down former East Germany's Communist government.
   Pressured during street protets earlier this month, Alia allowed
the formation of an opposition party. He has also tried to steer
the nation out of decades of self-imposed isolation, and relaxed a
ban on religious practice.
   The Communist government also recently ordered the dismantling
of statues and other images of Josef Stalin, and the renaming of
some institutions bearing the Soviet dictator's name.

   Vice President Dan Quayle told
U.S. troops Monday he shares their frustration with Saddam
Hussein's refusal to budge from Kuwait, saying the time for
patience is about up.
   Touring Saudi desert outposts nearly five months after Iraq's
president sent invasion forces into neighboring Kuwait, Quayle
sounded pessimistic about prospects for a peaceful settlement.
   ``You have heard some voices at home urging patience. They say
wait a year or two. Let the sanctions work,'' he said, referring to
the United Nations-imposed economic sanctions against the Baghdad
regime.
   ``But the sanctions have not gotten Saddam out of Kuwait. You
have been patient enough and so has President Bush,'' Quayle told
Marines and Army forces in remarks at two desert bases not far from
the Kuwaiti border.
   If war comes and the U.S troops drive Saddam's forces from
Kuwait, he said, ``The whole world will be grateful.''
   ``You are our heroes!'' Quayle declared.
   On the second day of a three-day trip to Saudi Arabia, the vice
president flew by military helicopter and plowed through desert
sands in military convoy vehicles to visit bases bustling with
massive war preparations.
   The tent bases he visited - one with Harrier jet aircraft that
can reach the border in three minutes  are expected to be involved
heavily in hostilities if war breaks out, military officials said.
   At the Third Armored Calvary Regiment base, some 40 miles from
the border, Quayle inspected the new M1A1 heavy armored tanks
recently brought in to upgrade the older models. He played
basketball and volleyball with the troops, ate with them, talked by
telephone to their families at a special desert satellite phone
center, and inspected their readiness equipment.
   The personnel Quayle met seemed mostly resigned to the prospect
of war and eager to get it over with.
   ``We were scared when we first got here. Right now we're just
bored,'' Kenneth Merrill, an enlisted Army man.
   The troops received Quayle cordially. Some said they liked the
fact that he came to see them; others were indifferent.
   ``If he could get me out of here, that would be real nice,''
said Marine Lance Cpl. Richard Kamoe of Honolulu, whose job is
firing Stinger missiles.
   Sgt. Michael Collins, of Buffalo, N.Y., alluded to the
controversy during the 1988 presidential campaign surrounding
allegations that Quayle had used family connections to get enlisted
in the Indiana National Guard rather than being drafted during the
Vietnam War.
   ``Honest. We laughed a lot about it,'' Collins said.
   But many of the troops said they didn't give Quayle's military
background much thought.
   ``He is the vice president,'' said Capt. Norbert Jocz of
Blacksburg, Va.
   Quayle was accompanied by Lt. Gen. Calvin Waller, who stirred a
controversy for the Bush administration when he said Dec. 19 that
the U.S. forces would not be ready for military action by Jan. 15 -
the deadline in a U.N. resolution demanding Iraq's withdrawal from
Kuwait.
   Waller on Monday seemed reticent to talk to reporters, saying
his job was to support Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of
Operation Desert Shield. Schwarzkopf had recently countered
Waller's comments, saying ``they are ready'' for combat.
   Waller, who earlier had said he would recommend to Bush that the
U.S. forces not strike until mid-February, said Monday he would not
be making a recommendation at all because ``everybody has all the
information they need'' to make the decision.
   ``The armed forces are prepared for whatever decision the
president might make,'' Quayle told reporters traveling with him
here.
   Speaking to a few hundred pilots and other personnel of the 3rd
Marine Aircraft Wing, the most forward deployed fixed aircraft wing
of the U.S. forces, Quayle said, ``The fact is that a policy of
indefinite patience only could lead to a policy of appeasement''
that would leave Saddam Hussein victorious.
   ``Saddam Hussein may not withdraw unconditionally, and if he
doesn't then he will be forced out of Kuwait by military action,''
Quayle told the Marines.
   The vice president sought to reassure them that Bush would not
send them into a long Vietnam-like conflict.
   ``If force is necessary it will be quick, massive and decisive.
You will do your job and then go home to your loved ones,'' he said
to applause.
   But Collins remained unconvinced.
   ``I don't think things are going to be as easy as he makes them
out to be,'' he said. ``We're ready to go,'' the sergeant said, but
he speculated that a war could go on for several months.

<TEXT>
   The salaries of Vice President Quayle, federal
judges, members of Congress and other top government officials jump
by tens of thousands of dollars as of Tuesday because of
legislation Congress enacted last year with the support of
President Bush.
   The president's salary of $200,000 was unaffected, but those of
Quayle, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Chief Justice
William Rehnquist increase nearly 30 percent to $160,600 a year.
   Rank-and-file House members will see their salaries increase
from $96,600 in 1990 to $125,100 in 1991.
   Federal district judges would get the same boost, with appeals
court judges getting $132,700 and associate justices of the Supreme
Court $153,600.
   Cabinet-level officers in the executive branch would receive up
to $138,900.
   The salary increases in the House and judiciary were tied to new
limits on outside income, including a ban on accepting fees for
speeches.
   The Senate passed up on the big pay boost in order to keep its
outside income from speeches. Senators will join most rank-and-file
federal workers and take a cost of living increase.
   The new Senate salary will be $101,900, up from $98,400 in 1990.

<HEAD>Iraqi Ambassador Returns To Post With Tough PR Job Ahead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Iraqi ambassador returns to his
posting next week, he will find himself back on the hot seat,
performing one of the most difficult public relations jobs in the
world.
   Mohamed Al-Mashat is assigned to deliver a message Americans
find repugnant: defending Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. He has performed his task with dedication,
arguing his case forcefully and stridently on myriad television
news shows.
   Since coming to Washington, Mashat has also built bridges with
members of Congress.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., telephoned Mashat in
Baghdad last week, hoping to get the ball rolling on the diplomatic
front in an effort to avert war in the Persian Gulf.
   Mashat told Dole Saddam might be willing to compromise on a date
for diplomatic talks, thus raising optimism about a break in the
impasse over direct U.S.-Iraqi discussions.
   Since Aug. 2, Mashat has embraced his public relations role with
relish. With his pitch-black hair and roguish cigarette holder,
he's a figure who's hard to miss.
   ``I never turn down an invitation,'' Mashat said recently at a
panel discussion sponsored by the alumnae of Skidmore College. It
was one of three engagements to which he had committed that
evening.
   Whatever he was expecting, Mashat did not find a sympathetic
audience. Some people shouted at him as he relentlessly propounded
Iraq's position: the former foreign hostages were ``guests;'' the
Kuwait-Iraq dispute must be solved by the Arabs; the United Nations
sanctions are hurting Iraq's children; the Kuwait crisis must be
solved in conjunction with the Arab-Israeli crisis.
   ``Iraq will never fire the first shot,'' Mashat said. But, if
attacked, Iraq will fight to the bitter end. The gulf crisis is an
``Arab problem and solutions should come from the Arabs,'' he said.
   The volatile Mashat became so upset when the moderator cut him
off that he threatened to walk out.
   A top news executive also complained that Mashat was completely
inflexible and ideological when the newspaper invited the
ambassador to a round-table luncheon. ``He wouldn't stop talking,''
said the executive, who asked to remain anonymous.
   Mashat says he is trying simply to explain his country's
position. He blames the news media for distorting what is happening
inside Kuwait and for fomenting trouble by siding with Israel.
   ``Even the most skilled diplomat would have a tough time''
handling the task given Mashat, said Marshall Wiley, a former U.S.
ambassador to Iraq who knows him.
   Mashat's public relations show operates without much backup
since his embassy staff was reduced from 55 to 16 in September in
tit-for-tat expulsions with the United States.
   From time to time, Mashat is summoned to the State Department to
be dressed down by American diplomats.
   Although Mashat, 59, presents Iraq's point of view in a
belligerent tone in public, he is a big fan of America and
Americans. He studied at the University of Maryland and the
University of California.
   Mashat's first wife was American. He lives in the nation's
capital with his second wife and their three children.
   `The American people and the Iraqi people have not problems
personally,'' Mashat says. Before the invasion, he traveled around
the United States frequently. He is particularly fond of
California.
   Before he came to the United States, Mashat had served as his
country's ambassador to London, Paris and Vienna.

<HEAD>Duryea Group Turns to Bank Loan to Buy Historic Car</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents have rounded up all the money they
needed to buy one of the last remaining examples of a three-wheeled
car believed assembled in Peoria in 1898.
   The Bring Home the Duryea Committee fell short in its
fund-raising efforts but obtained a loan to complete the purchase
price for the automobile built by Charles Duryea, a spokesman said
Sunday.
   John Parks, co-chairman of the committee, said a $125,000 check
will be sent next week to the owner of the 1898 Duryea Motor Trap.
   Parks said the group was able to raise only $103,000 to buy the
Duryea from L. Scott Bailey of Gloucester, England, founder of
Automobile Quarterly magazine.
   The committee obtained a six-month loan for the rest of the
amount, Parks said. Bailey had given the Peoria group until Tuesday
to raise the money.
   ``We still haven't determined a final place to exhibit the
car,'' Parks said. It's been on display at the Peoria Public
Library.
   Parks said the committee must turn its attention to building a
continuing fund to pay for a display location and to maintain the
car.
   The Smithsonian Institution recognizes Charles Duryea and his
brother, Frank Duryea, as the fathers of the American automobile.
They built the first gasoline-powered automobile in the United
States in 1883 in Massachusetts. That vehicle is in the
Smithsonian.
   The committee says 12 Traps were built in the Peoria area and
just two still exist. The other is in the Henry Ford Museum in
Greenfield Village, Mich.
   Duryea moved his production operations to Reading, Pa., after
falling on hard times in Peoria.

<HEAD>Human Rights Chairman: Review of Dartmouth Review Shows No Bias</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of New Hampshire's Human
Rights Commission said Monday he found no evidence of
discrimination against blacks, women, homosexuals or Jews in an
off-campus Dartmouth College newspaper.
   Barry Palmer said he reached his conclusion after reading two
years of The Dartmouth Review.
   Palmer said he conducted the study as an individual, not on
behalf of the commission, after continued criticism of the paper by
Dartmouth President James Freedman. Freedman has said the paper
published by conservative students consistently attacks those
groups.
   The Review, published since 1980, has been vilified for years
for its views on women, homosexuals, blacks and Indians.
   Palmer said the five-member commission acts as a body on policy
only, that investigations and reviews are conducted by one of the
three commission investigators or the commissioners individually.
   Criticizing blacks, women, homosexuals or Jews is not prejudice
as long as the criticism is aimed at performance, and not sexual or
racial status, Palmer said.
   Kevin Pritchett, editor of the weekly newspaper, said that
``from the very start, the Review has criticized people, not
because of their race or sex (but) because of the way they
performed.''
   Freedman was away and not available to respond to Palmer's
findings, but college spokesman Roland Adams disagreed with
Palmer's assessment.
   ``Just this particular summer, the Dartmouth Review equated the
lives of 1,400 Moslems with 7,000 penguins,'' he said. ``It said
the deaths of each were equally tragic. They apologized for that,
but then, the Review seems to be apologizing all the time.''
   Palmer, who also is a copy editor for The Union Leader newspaper
of Manchester, said the commission ``is very sensitive to anything
which takes away from a human being's self-worth and is always
seeking evidence of such bias, whether in print or verbal form.''
   ``I read every single thing they wrote about teachers. I
reviewed editorials and editorial cartoons. And I didn't find any
hint of bigotry or prejudice,'' Palmer said.
   ``After reviewing two years of the publication, I began
wondering what all the fuss was about.''
   Palmer said he undertook the review after Freedman raised
questions of discrimination.
   Earlier this year, on Yom Kippur, Judaism's most solemn day, a
quote from Adolf Hitler was inserted into the Review's masthead,
infuriating people on and off campus.
   The quote read: ``Therefore, I believe today that I am acting in
the sense of the Almighty Creator: By warding off the Jews, I am
fighting for the Lord's work.''
   Trustees and staffers said the quote was the work of a saboteur
and apologized.
   Backlash from the quote led the newspaper's president and two
staffers to quit.
   Freedman called the quote an ``egregious expression of
anti-Semitism'' and ``appalling bigotry.''
   William Cole, a black music professor, resigned in August after
The Review attacked him for seven years as a mediocre teacher. Cole
said his effectiveness was compromised by the attacks.
   Review staffers also were involved in a 1986 sledgehammer attack
on shanties that were eected on the campus green as part of a
protest against segregation in South Africa. Several staffers were
suspended.

<HEAD>INS Plans Express Lane at Some Border Crossings, for a Fee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service says
it plans to charge a fee to motorists who use new express lanes
along the Canadian and Mexican borders.
   A pilot program is scheduled to be established next spring by
the INS at a few locations along both borders. The participating
border crossings and how much travelers will be charged for using
the optional express lanes have not been determined yet, INS
spokesman Duke Austin said.
   The lanes would be staffed with extra inspectors to speed border
crossings.
   A fee plan was ordered by Congress in the 1991 Appropriations
Act, which passed in October, to offset the recent traffic increase
at border crossings. Money generated by the tolls would be used to
hire more inspectors and expand inspection stations, Austin said.
   ``We are stressing that use of the fee lanes is voluntary,''
Austin said Saturday. ``There will still be non-fee lanes for those
who choose not to pay.''
   But immigrant rights groups are criticizing the fund-raising
method, contending the plan may lead to a tax on anyone entering
the United States - similar to what's done with international air
travel.
   ``That's a heck of a way to balance their budget,'' said Mario
Moreno, an attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund.
   The INS plans to submit program guidelines for congressional
approval in February.
   About 13 million vehicles passed through U.S. border inspection
points in 1989.

   Israel's Antiquities Authority on Monday
dismissed a Harvard scholar as chief editor of the Dead Sea
Scrolls, citing health problems. The professor recently created an
uproar by making anti-Jewish statements.
   The editor, British-born divinity professor John Strugnell, was
replaced by an Israeli professor.
   Strugnell also had been criticized for the slow pace of
publication of the leather scrolls, discovered by a Bedouin
shepherd in 1946 in a cave near the Dead Sea.
   The ancient manuscripts are among the most significant
archaeological finds of the century because they include the oldest
known texts of the Old Testmant and shed light on the origins of
Christianity and the history of Judaism.
   In his announcement Monday, Amir Drori, the director of the
Israel Antiquities Authority, said Strugnell was being relieved at
the suggestion of the agency's three-man Scrolls Advisory
Committee.
   Strugnell, 60 and in ill health, remains hospitalized in the
United States, associates said. He could not be reached for
comment.
   He created a storm in Israel following an interview published on
Nov. 9 in the Haaretz newspaper. Strugnell, who is Roman Catholic,
described Judaism as ``a racist religion ... just like Hinduism''
in India.
   Asked what bothered him about Judaism, he said: ``The fact that
it survives. It should have disappeared. ... The solution to the
Jewish problem in my view is mass conversion to Christianity and
this is, of course, Christian theology and not my dear option.''
   Strugnell denied he was anti-Jewish, saying ``I don't love or
hate Jews more than I love or hate anybody else. There are Jews I
can't stand and there are Christians, Catholics even, that I can
stand even less.''
   He was severely criticized for the comments. The weekly
Jerusalem Report magazine headlined its article ``The Jew-Hater who
Controls the Scrolls,'' and several editorials questioned whether a
man with his opinions should continue as editor.
   It was Strugnell's health problems that prompted an
international editing team, including professors Frank Cross of
Harvard and Eugene Ulrich of the University of Notre Dame, to
recommend earlier in December that Strugnell be replaced.
   The international team had recommended that he be replaced by
three ``general editors,'' but Drori's announcement named just one
of the men, Israeli professor Emanuel Tov, as the editor in chief.
   The team also had recommended Ulrich and Father Emile Puech, a
French scholar working at the Ecole Biblique in Jerusalem.
   Tov is the only Israeli among the three. A Hebrew University
professor, he had been named as co-editor by the Antiquities
Authority in October. He is on sabbatical in the Netherlands and
could not be reached for comment.
   A Hebrew University scholar said on condition of anonymity that
the change in editors means ``we are going to try and move things
along with more speed.''
   He praised Strugnell as ``a very fine scholar, a very learned
person'' but said that his ``personal problems'' had begun to
interfere with the project.
   Strugnell has done research on the scrolls since 1952 and was
editor since 1987.
   Magen Broshi, one of the members of the advisory committee,
estimated that about 80 percent of the scrolls have been published
and that what remains is complicated because it requires piecing
together thousands of fragments and interpreting them.
   Still, he said, Strugnell had agreed to a timetable that would
see the remaining documents published by 1997.
   An estimated 800 scrolls have been recovered, but many are in
fragments. Eight scrolls are displayed at the Israel Museum. The
remainder are in the Rockefeller Museum.

<HEAD>Healthy Child is March of Dimes National Ambassador for 1991</HEAD>

   The March of Dimes has chosen a healthy youngster
as its annual poster child. The girl, who was born more than three
months premature, proves miracles can happen, the charity said.
   Laura Krumwiede was given a 40 percent chance of surviving after
her birth in 1984. She weighed less than 2 pounds, her lungs were
unable to function, and she spent the first days of her life hooked
to a respirator.
   Today, the suburban Chicago youngster is a healthy
kindergartner, looking forward to meeting President Bush and
fulfilling her other duties as the 1991 national ambassador for the
March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation.
   The charity planned to introduce Laura to the nation Tuesday on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``Laura is our everyday reminder of the miracle of a healthy
child, and of the fact that sometimes we have to make that miracle
happen,'' said Jennifer L. Howse, March of Dimes president.
   ``Programs and treatments developed by March of Dimes
researchers helped save Laura's life.''
   Selecting a healthy poster child reflects the March of Dimes'
new focus on ``a healthy birth for every baby,'' the charity said
in a statement.
   Laura's new celebrity status hasn't gone to her head, said her
mother, Candyce, of Naperville, west of Chicago.
   ``She just takes it in stride,'' Mrs. Krumwiede said of her
daughter, a budding ballet dancer who is learning to read.
   ``She's excited about seeing President Bush because she loves
Millie the dog.''
   The March of Dimes was founded in 1938 to fight polio, and for
decades it chose disabled youngsters as poster children to
symbolize the struggle against the crippling disease.
   In 1958, the organization expanded its programs in an effort to
fight birth defects and low birthweights. More than 250,000 babies
each year are born weighing less than 5.5 pounds. Low birthweight
is related to 60 percent of all infant deaths and is closely
associated with birth defects, the charity said.
   The poster children were given the title of national ambassador
in 1986 to reflect their role as messengers of good will.
   As the 1991 ambassador, Laura will attend charity events
nationwide and appear with celebrities to raise awareness of the
March of Dimes.
   ``Laura was going to be my New Year's baby'' of 1985, Mrs.
Krumwiede said.
   But Laura was born on Oct. 2, 1984. She suffered several
life-threatening health problems associated with low birthweight
babies, and her parents were not sure they would ever be able to
bring her home.
   Laura was put in a neonatal intensive care unit, and given a
hormone to help her lungs develop. The March of Dimes said it led
the development of the units for high-risk infants, and its
researchers have studied the effects of the type of hormone Laura
was given.
   Laura overcame the odds.
   ``The miracle of Laura is not just the fact that she lived. The
miracle is that she has virtually no problems as a result of her
prematurity,'' Mrs. Krumwiede said.

   Actor Michael Crawford is back in the role he
left eight months ago in what was thought to be his final bow as
``The Phantom of the Opera.''
   ``I'm making friends with the stage again,'' Crawford said in an
interview before his New Year's Eve debut at the Ahmanson Theatre.
Crawford left the production in April, saying he was exhausted
after 1,069 performances.
   ``I was so tired. You have to pay things back to yourself, to
your mind and body,'' Crawford said. Now, he's refreshed and ready
to replace Robert Guillaume, who had been his replacement.
   ``It's like going back to college after missing two terms. Or
like an athlete who hasn't run for awhile. When you start running
again, you're a little sore,'' said Crawford, who is scheduled to
perform through March 31.
   Crawford wore the Phantom's mask when the show opened at the
Ahmanson on May 31, 1989. He originated the role in London and
performed it on Broadway, where he won a Tony Award.

   ATLANTA (AP) - You start by dating actress Jane Fonda, then ....
   Time has run out for entering cable television magnate Ted
Turner's $500,000 save-the-world contest.
   More than 1,000 manuscripts on the theme of the survival of the
planet had arrived by New Year's Eve, Turner Publishing Inc.
spokeswoman Marcia Dworetz said. Entries had to be postmarked by
Monday.
   The Turner Tomorrow Awards seek fiction set in the near future
with themes of ensuring the survival and prosperity of all life on
the planet. The top winner will receive $500,000 and be published.
   Turner, who is engaged to Ms. Fonda, announced the iterary
award, one of the world's richest, in 1989 to stimulate ideas to
improve the ecology and human relations.
   The winners will be announced June 3.
   Turner, chairman of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., is not involved in the judging, Ms. Dworetz said.
   ``A number of themes do crop up,'' she said. ``They range from
grass roots - communities working together to solve problems - to
`a child shall lead them' - children showing adults the errors of
their ways.''

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Singer Bobby McFerrin kicked off a 24-hour
chanting and humming spiritual event at Grace Cathedral atop Nob
Hill.
   The white-robed McFerrin, whose hits include ``Don't Worry Be
Happy,'' began the chant, dubbed ``Singing for Your Life,''
standing inside a circle of 22 people in the nave of the church
Sunday night.
   ``I've become very fascinated with religious and spiritual
significance of music in Third World countries, where everything is
celebrated and honored,'' said the singer. ``There's a reverence
toward everyday life that our modern living with its fast tempo is
rapidly losing.''
   McFerrin, who has won nine Grammy Awards, lined up about 300
singers for the event, said the Rev. Lauren Artress, pastor at the
Episcopal cathedral.
   ``What Bobby is doing here, with the singing and the meditation,
is in the tradition of an ancient Christian vigil,'' Artress said.
``The point is to open up.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Representatives of Martha (Sunny) C. Auerspberg
von Bulow, the socialite woman who has been in a coma for 10 years,
have donated $60,000 to a charity on her behalf.
   A committee of her three children, her lawyer and an executive
from Chemical Bank, where her account is handled, decided to donate
the money to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
   Mrs. von Bulow fell unconscious on Dec. 21, 1980. Her husband,
Claus, was accused and eventually acquitted of inducing the coma
with a shot of insulin.
   Mrs. von Bulow's doctors at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in
New York have said that she will not recover from her coma.
   The $60,000 donation was one of the largest of the year to the
fund, which also received checks of $150,000 each from Paul Newman
and from the Starr Foundation in Manhattan and a gift of $125,000
from the Willard T.C. Johnson Foundation Inc. in Manhattan. The
proceeds from the charity go to seven charities to aid the sick and
the poor.
   ``We could think of nothing that she would want to do more than
help those that cannot help themselves,'' Annie Laurie Isham, Mrs.
Von Bulow's oldest daughter, said in a statement. ``Mother loved
Christmas, and this holiday season has been a particularly harsh
one for the sick and the poor.''

<HEAD>Conductor in Chicago Provides Unique Ride</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conductor John Cameron gives passengers aboard
his elevated train a smile and tidbits of history aboard his ``Love
Train.''
   Cameron, 43, who introduces himself as ``The Rapper'' to
first-time passengers, says he started his routine 12 years ago to
brighten up otherwise dreary trips on the Chicago Transit Authority
train.
   ``Good morning,'' his voice booms over the train's intercom
before it departs the line's Howard Street station, the starting
point of an hour-long trip to Chicago's South Side. ``The time is
8:26, and the temperature is 32 degrees. Welcome aboard the Love
Train.
   ``Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride, 'cause you're riding first
class down Electric Avenue,'' he continues. `` Driver says I'm
going to make you look good, feel good and smell good 'cause I'm
the doctor who's going to cure all your aches.''
   Startled passengers who haven't heard Cameron's spiel look up
from their papers or break free of glassy-eyed stares. Veterans
smile knowingly.
   ``This guy is like a walking tourist map,'' said Arthur Rooks,
22. ``The first time I heard him, I thought he was kind of kooky.
But after you listen to him, you pick up little tidbits about the
city that you didn't know, even after living here for a while.''
   On any given trip, passengers might learn that the train passes
under the Chicago River at one point, or that one station was
designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright.
   Even the trendy nightspots get attention.
   ``Clark and Division,'' Cameron says at one stop. ``The Gold
Coast, the nightlife, the good life. Church on Sunday, the cabaret
on Monday, but it's nobody's business what you do.''
   Cameron has appeared on local television and radio shows and on
Oprah Winfrey's and Phil Donahue's talk shows.
   ``I didn't start this for all the publicity or honors,'' Cameron
said. ``I figure it's what the world needs right now. We need a
whole lot of love, and I figure whatever little bit I can do will
help.''

<HEAD>Is Yellowstone Too Crowded?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years of record tourism have shown
that Yellowstone National Park didn't lose its luster in its 1988
forest fires, but the crowds also raise the question of how many
people the park can stand.
   ``We've seen in the last few years much higher visitation in the
spring months and in the fall,'' said Ed Lewis, executive director
of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, an environmental group.
   ``In the past when you had very high visitation in the summer,
at least the resources in the park ... had a chance to recover
before the next press of visitors.
   ``That's becoming increasingly less of a case. I know just from
talking to people in the middle of the summer, you just have
endless traffic jams in the park, worse than before. The period of
high use is getting extended each year.''
   In 1987, 2.58 million people visited. The fires held 1988
visitation down to about 2.2 million.
   In 1989, people flocked to the park to see the effects of the
fires, pushing visitation to a record 2.68 million. In 1990, 2.8
million visited the 2.2 million-acre park, according to park
officials.
   Lewis maintains that Yellowstone is approaching its carrying
capacity of humans, but park Superintendent Bob Barbee disagrees.
   ``People come from a long way away, and I guess I feel that
we're somewhat fortunate that we're not besieged by tremendous
numbers. And if we were we would have to deal with it,'' Barbee
said.
   ``Right now, I don't see any big problem.''
   Lewis points to the strain he sees people placing on grizzlies
that are rising in number in the park.
   The bears flock toward Yellowstone Lake to feed on cutthroat
trout spawning in the spring and come into conflict with tourists
staying at the campgrounds and hotels surrounding the lake. When
those conflicts arise, the bears are relocated, he said.
   ``These are bears that are doing what comes naturally,'' Lewis
said. ``And we're seeing them moved more and more ... and we've
seen from past experience, the more you move a bear the more likely
that bear becomes a fatality.''
   Barbee agrees there are times during the summer when traffic
jams occur on the ``Grand Loop,'' which circles the park's
interior. But he doesn't see a need now to limit visitation.
   ``A lot of it is a matter of perception. But I honestly do not
think, that except on isolated circumstances on certain days of the
year ... that we have a crowding problem,'' the superintendent
said.
   Lewis wants the National Park Service to institute additional
measures to ease the crowds. One possibility, he said, would be to
alter seasonal openings, such as delaying the spring opening of
Lake Hotel and its surrounding cabins.
   The Greater Yellowstone Coalition also wants the Park Service to
look at what kind of toll burgeoning winter tourism industry is
having on the park.
   ``For years we have been asking the park to do further analysis
and planning of the winter season,'' said Lewis. ``We're really
concerned. We're very concerned that the analysis has not been done
to determine the impacts of this increased winter visitation.''
   Park spokeswoman Joan Anselmo said the park's winter use plan,
to be released in its final form in March, will address some of
those concerns. And she notes that the park has closed part of the
Fishing Bridge campground, removed cabins from West Thumb, and has
reduced the number of cabins at Old Faithful.
   The growing number of tourists and their impact are not being
overlooked, Barbee said.
   ``We're trying to manage the situation and deal with it
realistically and prudently and sensibly,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   In a videotaped New Year's greeting to ``all
the wonderful people of the Soviet Union,'' President Bush offered
a word of encouragement Monday to a beleaguered Mikhail Gorbachev,
saluting him for undertaking ``an arduous journey'' toward a new
society.
   The president, welcoming the Soviets as partners in the attempt
to force Iraq to give up its conquest of Kuwait, also hailed the
Soviet-American ``common approach to a new challenge in the name of
stability and peace.''
   ``I applaud, the world applauds, the decisive action of the
Soviet Union in strongly opposing Saddam Hussein's brutal
aggression in the Gulf,'' Bush said.
   Despite their previous close ties to Iraq, the Soviets have
supported the United States in the U.N. Security Council but
declined to send troops to join an allied army in Saudi Arabia.
   On a more personal level, Bush said he was thrilled about the
warmth developing between ordinary Soviet and American citizens as
a result of the relaxation of tensions in the aftermath of the Cold
War.
   ``Tens of thousands of Soviets have had contact with Americans
now, and the numbers are growing,'' the president said. ``Barbara
and I are thrilled to see our two peoples meeting and getting to
know one another as friendly neighbors.''
   Gorbachev, in a TV message to the American people, said he
expected his Moscow summit with Bush in February to give impetus to
the removal of ``old obstacles'' still hampering Soviet-American
relations.
   ``Economic and scientific and technological cooperation still do
not respond to the spirit of the time,'' he said.
   But, looking back, he summed up 1990 as a momentous year: ``The
Cold War is over. There is no more danger of nuclear catastrophe.
The horizons of peace have been widened.''
   He called Saddam Hussein's ``aggression'' an obstacle to peace
and said the international community ``should find strength to
overcome this obstacle.''
   And, addressing his own people in a television message scheduled
for midnight, Gorbachev said 1990 was ``one of the most difficult
years in our history.''
   ``Crisis phenomena in economics, the lowering of people's
personal safety, a weakening of order and discipline affected the
conditions of life,'' he said.
   Bush's New Year's message was taped last week for broadcast on
New Year's Day in the Soviet Union. At the same time, some U.S.
television stations will carry Gorbachev's message to the American
people. Cable News Network said it would air the two messages at 1
p.m. EST.
   The exchange continued a custom established, at America's
suggestion, by Gorbachev and then-President Ronald Reagan in 1986,
dropped in 1987 and resumed in 1988.
   In that first message, Reagan defended the American people's
``strong interest in humanitarian issues,'' saying that this
country was ``founded on the belief in the sanctity of human life
and the rights of the individual.''
   Gorbachev, in his 1989 message, called the exchange a
``meaningful symbol of our mutual willingness to go on moving
toward each other'' and stressed the Soviet people's interest in
peace, ``having suffered for it'' in World War II.
   In this year's remarks, Bush said the reform path on which
Gorbachev has embarked ultimately would lead to a brighter future
for the Soviet people.
   He made no reference to Gorbachev's struggle to keep his nation
from splintering, as some of the Soviet republics assert
uncompromising claims to sovereignty. Nor did Bush mention the way
Gorbachev's economic reforms have bogged down or the food shortages
which impelled Western countries to send emergency food supplies
this year to the Soviet Union.
   ``On this New Year's Day, as you celebrate with your friends and
family, I also want to applaud the Soviet Union for the important
steps you've taken in building a new society, for the determination
with which you are pressing forward with difficult political and
economic reforms,'' Bush said.
   ``It's an arduous journey, but one well worth making, for it is
a path that leads to a brighter future for your nation.''
   He concluded: ``On behalf of the American people, I wish
President Gorbachev and all the wonderful people of the Soviet
Union a happy, prosperous New Year.''

   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said Monday that
Israel is pushing the United States into a war against Iraq because
it wants to destroy Iraq's military and economic power.
   ``We are not reading the future, but this is what Israel wants -
to annihilate Iraq's military and technical power,'' Arafat said in
an interview with The Associated Press.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization leader said the only end
he foresaw to the gulf crisis was through negotiations on all
Middle East problems, including the Palestinian issue. He urged the
European Community to avert war in the region.
   The foreign ministers of the 12 European Community states are to
meet in an emergency session Friday to discuss the crisis, and
officials say they could decide to open talks with Iraq.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has insisted on linking a
settlement of the crisis with the Palestinian problem.
   The United States has refused such linkage as a condition for
peace talks.
   The PLO has supported Saddam in the gulf crisis. Arafat's
backing was based on the premise Saddam was the only Arab leader
who could force a solution to the Palestinian problem.
   
   Israeli officials would not comment on Arafat's statements.
   But when asked about his country's position regarding the United
States and the gulf, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yosef Amihud said:
``We don't advise, we don't suggest and besides the U.S. makes its
own decisions.''
   Israel has repeatedly said that any solution that left Iraq with
its military might intact would threaten it. But it also has said
that it is not pushing the United States to make any decisions on
the gulf.
   The U.N. Security Council has set a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait or face the possibility of a military attack
by the U.S.-led multinational force deployed in Saudi Arabia and
the gulf region.
   ``Time is running out for us, Iraq, the United States and
everybody,'' Arafat said. ``How can we resolve it peacefully
without talks and without negotiations?''
   Arafat ruled out the possibility of an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait without talks between the United States and Iraq on other
Middle East issues.
   ``Before talks there can be no solution or compromise,'' he
said.
   Saddam has invited U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III for
talks in Baghdad on Jan. 12, but the Bush administration has
rejected the proposal, saying the date is too close to the U.N.
deadline.
   Arafat arrived in Iraq on Sunday. He has held talks with Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz on the situation in the area and the
Israeli occupied territory.
   Arafat, who heads the PLO's mainstream Fatah guerrilla faction,
denied that the gulf crisis has adversely affected the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied territories.
   ``Some people believed that the gulf crisis has eclipsed the
intefadeh (uprising) and others have said the Palestinian issue has
been shelved,'' he said. ``But look and see how the Palestinian
question has topped all issues on (the) world agenda.''
   Tuesday marks the 26th anniversary of the first armed attack
inside Israel by Fatah.
   The Palestinians will continue their struggle against the Jewish
state until they achieve their goal for an independent state and
self determination, Arafat said.
   Earlier Monday, Israel killed 12 Fatah guerrillas in a raid near
Sidon in southern Lebanon.
   A PLO communique warned that Israel planned a ``massive military
operation'' in southern Lebanon and had sent reinforcements to its
self-proclaimed ``security zone'' just north of the Israel-Lebanon
border. Security forces in the region said there had been no such
buildup.

   The Army said Monday it is ordering to active

the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in support of Operation
Desert Shield.
   Among the units being mobilized is the 2nd Battalion, 142nd
Field Artillery of the Arkansas National Guard, based at Fort
Smith. The other units are being called up for noncombat services
such as public affairs, maintence and law enforcement.
   Maj. Cissy Lashbrook, a spokeswoman at the Arkansas National

the 2nd Battalion already are training at Fort Sill, Okla., the
Army's main artillery training center. She said the unit is
scheduled to deploy to Saudi Arabia and that lead elements already
are there.
   More than 125,000 members of the Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marine Corps reserves have been called to active duty for Desert
Shield since late August.

<TEXT>
   NBC News is launching its new 24-hour
News Channel on New Year's Day, feeding video of late-breaking
news, sports and features from a new base in Charlotte to network
affiliates for local use.
   Until now, the network had been feeding its affiliates several
times a day from New York City.
   ``We were better off getting out of New York and creating our
own identity,'' said Bob Horner, a former CBS News bureau chief
who's now in charge of what he describes as ``a video wire
service.''
   Real estate costs, climate and access to a major airport also
played a role.
   ``Charlotte is a thriving city with a good business climate,''
he said. ``It's also blessed with strong local media.''
   NBC News Channel will feed raw and edited footage, including
foreign, domestic and regional material, to local stations, which
can then edit the reports for use on their newscasts.
   ``Local stations want more variety,'' Horner said. ``Some
smaller companies, like CNN, have been more aggressive in using
satellite technology to help individual stations.''
   For now, Horner and his staff of about 50 producers and editors
are working out of temporary offices. Later this year, the NBC News
Channel will move into a 10,000-square-foot wing of the new studio
of the local NBC affiliate, WCNC.
   Two weeks ago, NBC News signed the Nippon Television Network
(NTV) as the News Channel's first overseas affiliate.
   In exchange for exclusive rights to news material from the NBC
News Channel, NTV will give NBC News the same rights to all
Japanese and international news material of NTV, Japan's largest
private broadcast network.
   Horner said his staffers are experienced professionals who are
used to working behind the scene.
   ``(CBS sportscaster) John Madden would love this team,'' he
said, a reference to the former NFL coach's affection for
unheralded football players, particularly linemen.
   ``It's not particularly glamorous work but it's very
interesting,'' Horner said. ``I look for people who want to get the
news on the air.''
   He said locating in Charlotte was not an effort to get away from
unions.
   ``Although I know people have attributed different motives to
this, that really isn't the problem. The work that was being done
in New York was done by people who weren't in the union,'' Horner
said.
   But the president of the New York local of the National
Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians' disputed that.
   ``Mr. Horner may be correct in claiming that Charlotte is a
thriving city with a good business climate,'' said John Clark,
whose union represents some NBC employees.
   ``But he chooses to ignore the prime reason that NBC moved its
skycam operation from New York, and that was to avoid paying union
protected wages mandated in the broadcast capital of the world -
New York City.''

<TEXT>
   Relations are strained between the
civilian government and the military that ruled for almost 17
years, but the real test is soon to come.
   The government is expected to issue reports in the next few
weeks on financial and human rights investigations of the military.
But Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who relinquished the presidency in
March, remains army commander and has not adjusted easily to the
reduction in his power.
   On Dec. 19, Pinochet put the army on alert to protest what it
calls unfair news coverage of a series of corruption accusations
involving military men.
   Pinochet later described the action as ``just an exercice on
security, readiness and coordination.''
   President Patricio Aylwin said the alert ``had no justification
whatsoever, and shows the military lack an understanding of what
democratic life is all about.'' Aylwin summoned Pinochet to the
presidential palace to demand an explanation.
   The president later admitted the alert was a sign of military
unrest.
   While government officials and politicians from right to left
say the situation does not pose a threat to the newly restored
democracy, they also say it must be taken seriously.
   ``It is a serious situation,'' said Julio Dittborn, president of
the Independent Democratic Union, a far-right party that supported
Pinochet's 16{-year authoritarian government.
   The alert showed Pinochet's strong support in the army,
according to Dittborn.
   Pinochet, 75, turned over the presidency to Aylwin, an elected
civilian, on March 11. However, under a special clause in the 1980
constitution, written by the military government, Pinochet remains
commander of the 60,000-member army and Aylwin is prohibited from
firing him.
   Sergio Bitar, a socialist leader in Aylwin's governing
coalition, also described the situation as serious.
   ``These are hurdles in the democratic transition,'' he said in
an interview. ``But what is clear is that there are no conditions
in the country for a coup attempt.''
   ``There will be more difficulties, but there is no reason for
fear,'' Bitar added. He said the government has no problems with
the navy, air force and the national police.
   Bitar and government officials say they expect the real test in
government-military relations to come in the next few weeks, when
reports are to be issued by two special panels investigating the
military.
   The first one is a congressional group investigating the army's
payment of $3 million to a son of Pinochet for the purchase of an
arms factory in financial trouble. That panel's report is due by
mid-January.
   On Feb. 9, a report will be issued by a special commission
formed by Aylwin to investigate widespread human rights violations
during the Pinochet years.
   Both investigations are expected to lead to trials involving
military officers.
   A judge investigating an illegal savings and loan organization
that operated inside the army has already indicted eight officers,
seven of them retired, on charges of breaking banking laws.
   The news coverage of all three cases has clearly bothered
Pinochet and the military, and was widely seen as a a key reason
for the army alert.
   Retired Col. Cristian Labbe, one of Pinochet's closest aides and
allies, told the Santiago daily La Tercera that the alert ``was a
message, and the government has clearly understood it.''
   Government officials and news reports say the army has asked the
government to request reporters to play down coverage. During the
talks, the reports say, the Army even suggested Pinochet might be
prepared to retire in exchange.
   Most observers see Pinochet's strong personality as a key
element in the dispute.
   A government official who witnessed the general's interview with
Aylwin the day after the alert, said Pinochet interrupted the
president when he told him, ``General, I've summoned you ... ''
   ``Invited me, Mr. President, you have invited me,'' Pinochet
said, according to the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Interviewed by the state television last month, Aylwin said
Pinochet has trouble adjusting to a subordinate post ``after ruling
the country as an absolute master for 17 years.''
   However, Aylwin later said he had changed his opinion of
Pinochet ``as a human being,'' and that he now thinks his
predecessor respects his authority.
   ``I must say that I respect the courage with which he has faced
the reduction of his position from president to commander in
chief,'' Aylwin told the government newspaper La Nacion.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker
III will likely visit Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations to
consult with U.S. allies before a mid-January deadline for Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait, an administration official said Monday.
   Baker also is considering a visit to Europe during that time,
said the official, who was traveling with Vice President Dan Quayle
on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia.
   The purpose of the trip would be to ``touch bases'' with the
Gulf leaders prior to the deadline, after which the United Nations
has authorized use of force to eject Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's army, said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Officials accompanying Quayle said it appeared unlikely that
Baker would meet with Saddam by Jan. 3, the end of the time frame
that President Bush set for such a face-to-face talk in Baghdad.
   However, the possibility remains that if Baker did travel to the
Middle East to see other leaders, Saddam could invite him to
Baghdad at that time, one official speculated.
   Baker's visit to the region would be in the way of a final
consultation, although all plans for military readiness are already
in place should Bush decide to launch an attack, the official said.
   Saddam has suggested that Baker meet with him on Jan. 12, a date
the Bush admnistration contends is too close to the Jan. 15
deadline.
   Administration officials have said that even if Baker does meet
with Saddam, the purpose would be only to reiterate in person the
United States' demand for Iraqi acceptance of a U.N. resolution
demanding full withdrawal from Kuwait, with no compromise.
   There are some signs of flexibility on the part of the two sides
in the disagreement over timing. The State Department has not ruled
out a Baker trip to Baghdad after Jan. 3. At the same time, Iraqi
Ambassador Mohammed Al-Mashat told Senate Minority leader Robert
Dole, R-Kan., over the weekend that Saddam is not wedded to a
meeting on Jan. 12, according to Dole.
   In Washington, State Department press officer Mark Dillen said
Baker, who has been on vacation in Houston, plans to return to
Washington Tuesday night.
   Meanwhile, Al-Mashat reportedly was returning to Washington
Monday night from consulations in Baghdad.
   Al-Mashat was one of a number of Iraqi diplomats who took part
in the Baghdad discussions but Iraq has denied that a peace
initiative was in the works. Dillen said Al-Mashat is not on the
schedule of any State Department official either Tuesday or
Wednesday.
   Dillen also was asked about the possibility of a meeting between
European Community representatives and Saddam.
   He recalled that when a similar initiative was proposed earlier
this month, Baker said then he supports initiatives aimed at
achieving a diplomatic solution provided they are consistent with
implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions on Iraq.

   Crews pulled the last worker from the rubble less than four
hours after the accident Monday at the Consolidated Edison plant on
Staten Island, said Joe McGee, a Fire Department spokesman.
   The workers were performing maintenance on a boiler when the
100-foot-high scaffolding inside the boiler gave way, said Marty
Gitten, a Con Ed spokesman.
   ``It looks like a giant erector set which crumbled,'' said
McGee.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation.
   The four admitted to a hospital were listed as stable, Staten
Island Hospital officials said.

<HEAD>Japan Offers Aid Restoration if Iraq Pulls Out of Kuwait</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan is ready to offer economic aid to Iraq if it
withdraws peacefully from Kuwait, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said
in a New Year's statement.
   Japan, which had been Iraq's top aid donor, froze $2.96 billion
in assistance to the Baghdad government after its Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.
   The United Nations has given Iraq until Jan. 15 to withdraw or
face possible military action by U.S.-led international forces.
   ``I hope that Iraq will make a decision for a peaceful solution.
If it does, then Japan is prepared to extend economic
cooperation,'' Kaifu told Japanese reporters in a news conference
to be broadcast on New Year's Day.
   Japan has pledged $2 billion in aid to the international forces,
and another $2 billion to nations suffering from the international
embargo against Iraq.
   But Kaifu had to abandon a proposal to send members of Japan's
military for non-combat roles with the international forces.
Critics said it would have violated the nation's peace
constitution.
   In a separate New Year's message, Koshiro Ishida, chairman of
Japan's second-largest opposition party, said Japan should come up
with a policy for taking part in U.N. peacekeeping activities.
   But Takako Doi, chairwoman of the biggest opposition party, the
Socialists, said Japan should become an ``exporter of peace.''
   She said it is important to spread the principles of Japan's
constitution, which renounces war as a means of solving
international conflicts.
   The Persian Gulf crisis also figured in a poem composed by
Emperor Akihito to mark the New Year, in which he referred to
Japanese formerly held hostage in Iraq. In it, he expressed concern
for the fate ``of those detained in a foreign land.''

<HEAD>Texas Speaker Surrenders, Released on Bond</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Texas Speaker Gib Lewis surrendered Monday
to face two misdemeanor ethics charges. After his release on bail,
he said he would still seek a record fifth term as House leader.
   Lewis surrendered at the Travis County jail and was released 20
minutes later on a personal recognizance bond of $10,000.
   Lewis said the indictments will not deter his plan to seek an
unprecedented fifth two-year term as speaker when the 1991
Legislature convenes Jan. 8.
   ``I have seen nothing that would indicate that I should not. I
don't think anybody else has either,'' Lewis said.
   He said the charges were unfounded, and he denounced a newspaper
report that in April 1987 he shared a Mexican resort suite with a
female receptionist from the law firm linked to his indictment.
   ``That's just a trashy allegation. That's not even good
journalism. That's not even good politics,'' said Lewis, a Democrat
from Fort Worth.
   The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday that Lewis, 54, and Toni
Barcellona, 27, now an Austin lobbyist, were among the six men and
six women who spent three days together on the vacation paid for by
the law firm of Heard Goggan Blair &amp; Williams.
   The law firm has denied wrongdoing. Ms. Barcellona has not
returned several telephone messages by The Associated Press.
   Lewis was indicted Friday by a grand jury on misdemeanor counts
of receiving a gift from Heard Goggan and of failing to report the
benefit on the public financial disclosure statement that must be
filed by officeholders.
   The charges stem from a tax payment made by the law firm for
business taxes owed by Lewis, said Travis County District Attorney
Ronnie Earle.
   Lewis' attorneys say Earle, who has vigorously criticized state
ethics laws as being too lax, is on a vendetta to topple the
speaker.
   Lewis said he has been wrongly accused of trying to kill ethics
reforms.
   ``I'm the only person that has sat down with Ronnie Earle and
asked him for his recommendation on what he thinks should go into a
plan, and all of sudden I get bushwhacked by somebody saying, `He
is against ethics,''' Lewis said.
   If convicted on the two counts, Lewis faces a maximum of 18
months in prison and fined $3,000. Lewis' attorneys said the
speaker will plead innocent.
   The grand jury investigation is continuing. Earle says it has
expanded to include more legislators and lobbyists.

<HEAD>Farm Prices for Raw Products Declined in December</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers get for raw products ended 1990
with a 0.7 percent decline from November to December, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Lower prices were reported for milk, hogs and lettuce, although
higher prices for cattle, peanuts and eggs helped ease the decline
of the other commodities.
   However, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said
fruit and vegetable prices were recorded before unseasonably cold
weather hit California about Dec. 21.
   Consequently, the report did not reflect the freezing cold that
hit California citrus and vegetables before Christmas.
   Record high monthly prices were reported for cattle, but hog
prices were down again, the report said.
   ``Oats and wheat were each at their lowest level for the month
of December since 1972,'' it said. ``Corn increased slightly from
November while the soybean price decreased slightly.''
   Most prices are mid-December averages which will be revised next
month.
   No new figures were released to show how much farmers paid to
meet expenses. Those are adjusted quarterly.
   Department economists forecast 1991 consumer food prices will
climb an average of 2 percent to 5 percent, compared with a 6
percent gain in 1990. Larger output of some major commodities is
expected to help cool the price climb.
   The net cash income of farmers in 1991 has been forecast by USDA
at $55 billion to $60 billion, which could put it down from the
record of $59 billion in calendar 1990.
   As used by the agency, net cash income is simply the difference
between gross cash income and cash expenses.
   In another way of accounting, 1991 net farm income may be in the
range of $44 billion to $49 billion, compared with the 1990 record
of $49 billion.
   The report said:
   -Cattle averaged $77.60 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $75.30 in November. A year earlier cattle
averaged $71 per hundredweight. Those are averages for all types of
cattle sold as beef.
   -Hogs averaged $47.60 per hundredweight, down from $50.20 in
November. A year earlier hogs averaged $48.20.
   -Corn, at $2.18 per bushel, was up a penny from November but was
down 9 cents from a year earlier.
   -Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $2.38 per bushel, compared with $2.39 in November and
$3.79 in December 1989.
   -Rice averaged $6.26 per 100 pounds, compared with $6.30 in
November and $6.95 a year earlier.
   -Soybeans were $5.74 per bushe, compared with $5.78 in November
and $5.64 in December 1989.
   -Upland cotton was reported at 67.3 cents per pound, compared
with 68.2 cents in November and 61.9 cents a year earlier.
   -Eggs were 76.5 cents per dozen, compared with 72.9 cents in
November and 82.8 cents a year earlier.
   -Broilers were 28.8 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
28.2 in November and 28.6 cents a year earlier.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail Gorbachev said Monday in his New
Year's address to the Soviet people that 1990 was one of his
country's toughest years.
   In a speech broadcast nationwide just before midnight, Gorbachev
said the ``passing year was one of the most difficult in our
history. ... Crisis phenomena in economics, the lowering of
people's personal safety, a weakening of order and discipline
affected the conditions of life.''
   In a remark that would have been uncharacteristic of his
predecessors, Gorbachev admitted the leaders of this country of 285
million residents had made mistakes but he did not specify what
they were.
   In the coming year, the Soviets are to vote in a nationwide
referendum on whether to join a federation of sovereign republics.
The issue is crucial to whether this vast nation of 11 time zones
is fractured into individual states, as Lithuania and several other
independence-minded republics want.
   ``There is no more sacred matter than the preservation and
renewal of the union in which all people would live voluntarily and
well,'' the 59-year-old Kremlin chief said.
   The Soviet leader, in office nearly six years, called on the
people in the 15 republics to achieve ``civil and inter-ethnic
accord'' and to work hard together to overcome difficulties in
1991.
   In a separate New Year's address to the American people on
Monday, Gorbachev welcomed February's superpower summit and
renewing his call for a peaceful solution to the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Gorbachev acknowledged that 1990 was a difficult year for the
Soviet people, but said short-term disruptions were necessary for
longterm stability.
   ``The outgoing year, 1990, as well as the 1980s, was filled with
events of great importance,'' he said. ``The Cold War is over.
There is no more danger of nuclear catastrophe. The horizons of
peace have widened.''
   However, the Soviet president said, ``much has not been
completed,'' including an end to the crisis caused by Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   ``The international community has run into a serious obstacle
... the aggression in the gulf,'' he said. ``It should find
strength to overcome this obstacle, not to discontinue the advance
toward a peaceful period of civilization.''
   Gorbachev said he expected his Feb. 11-13 meeting with President
Bush in Moscow would give ``new impetus'' to Soviet-American
relations, still hampered by some ``old obstacles.''
   ``Economic and scientific and technological cooperation still do
not respond to the spirit of the time,'' he said.''
   On domestic matters, Gorbachev said 1990 was ``a year of
principle changes in society, a year of the most difficult but the
most necessary decisions.''
   ``They will allow this great country - and it remains such - to
overcome the critical situation and to follow the path of stable
democratic processes,'' he said.

   With the threat of a U.S.-led attack just
16 days away, Iraq on Monday ordered 17-year-olds to prepare to
leave their schools and report for military duty.
   It is the youngest age group ever drafted in modern Iraq. Even
during the 1980-88 war against Iran only 18-year-olds were put into
battle, normally at the end of their 18th year.
   The General Mobilization Headquarters instructed males born in
1973 to sign up with the nearest recruitment center between
Wednesday and Jan. 10. It threatened those who fail to enlist with
unspecified ``legal action.''
   Iraqi teen-agers abroad are not exempted, the agency said.
   Jan. 15 is the deadline set by the U.N. Security Council for
Iraq to pull out of Kuwait. After that date, the multinational
forces are authorized to oust Iraq by force.
   It was the fourth major call-up by Iraq authorities since the
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. An unspecified number of reservists ages
30, 31 and 32 had been ordered to active duty in previous
announcements.
   It wasn't known how many youths would be affected. The
London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies recently
said the nation of 17 million has about 1.1 million males aged
13-17, 900,000 ages 18-22 and 1.3 million ages 23-32.
   Iraq has a regular army of 500,000 with 480,000 reserves, nearly
all of whom have been mobilized for the gulf crisis.
   A 28-nation, U.S.-led multinational force of about 480,000
troops is confronting an estimated 510,000 Iraqis deployed in
Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   Also Monday, officials disclosed that 10 civil defense drills
were conducted sucessfully in Iraq's northern Duhok Province, along
the border with Turkey, after Ankara reportedly reinforced its army
in the region.
   The Duhok Civil Defense officer, Qassim Ahmed Mustafa, told the
government newspaper Al-Thawra the drills were aimed at ``preparing
the population for war, air raids and mass-destruction weapons.''
   Duhok Gov. Mohammed Peroz was quoted as saying that
``contingency plans have been drawn to face up to any eventuality
in the event of war.''
   Duhok is home for 300,000 Iraqis, most of them ethnic Kurds.
   Drills were also conducted in recent days in Baghdad and the
southern city of Basra. They involved a complete evacuation of the
two cities to safe hideouts several miles away.
   Health Minister Abdul-Salam Mohammed Said claimed Monday that
more than 4,200 people have died because of shortages in medical
supplies caused by the U.N. embargo. Western officials have
repeatedly challenged similar Iraqi claims.
   Western officials say Iraq has received 120 tons of medicine
from humanitarian groups since mid-October, and have dismissed
Baghdad's claims on infant deaths since the embargo.
   Shipments of food and medicines for humanitarian purposes are
not banned by the U.N. embargo begun after the Iraqi invasion.
   But Baghdad claims many governments have refused to allow export
of goods, even medicine ordered and paid for before the sanctions.

<HEAD>Acreage Reduction Program Spelled Out by Yeutter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An acreage reduction program for wheat, corn
and other crops were among the details of the 1991 commodity
programs announced Monday by Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   Much of the programs were spelled out in the five-year 1990 farm
law recently enacted by Congress.
   The 1991 programs include an ``acreage reduction program''
requirement of 15 percent for wheat; 7.5 percent for corn, barley
and sorghum; 5 percent for upland and extra-long staple cotton; and
zero percent for oats.
   The acreage reduction program, or ARP, indicates much of a
farmer's base acres must be taken from production in order to
qualify for federal price support benefits.
   Yeutter said farmers can begin signing up at local offices of
the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service in early
March. He said specific dates will be announced later.
   A central feature of the new law will allow farmers greater
planting flexibility. Some highlights:
   -Producers may plant crops other than the program crop - wheat,
corn, sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton and rice - on up to 25
percent of any participating program crop acreage base. This will
be known as ``flex'' acreage.
   -Permitted crops on flex acreage are: any program crop, any
oilseed, any designated industrial of experimental crop, and any
other crop except fruit or vegetables, including potatoes, dry
edible beans, lentils and peas.
   -The secretary may, however, prohibit the planting of any crop
on flex acreage and is required to make available a list of
prohibited crops.
   -The first 15 percent of the flex acreage will be known as
``normal flex acreage,'' or NFA, and the other 10 percent will be
known as ``optional flex acreage,'' or OFA.
   Further details of the 1991 crop programs will be available from
local ASCS offices.

<DATELINE>CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white supremacist arrested here
Monday could be returned to Mississippi this week to face a third
trial for the 1963 slaying of civil rights leader Medgar Evers.
   Byron De La Beckwith, 70, was arrested on a governor's warrant
charging him with first-degree murder and was jailed without bond.
   Beckwith's attorney, Russell Bean, filed a writ of habeas corpus
seeking his release and a hearing was set for Wednesday before
Hamilton County Criminal Court Judge Joe DiRisio, who will decide
on extradition.
   If DiRisio finds the governor's warrant is in order, he could
immediately turn Beckwith over to Mississippi authorities, said
Hamilton County Chief Deputy Jim Hammond.
   ``The purpose of that hearing is basically just to try to keep
(Beckwith) from going to Mississippi by (his attorney) saying it's
improper paperwork,'' Hammond said.
   Beckwith was tried twice in 1964 for the slaying of Evers, field
secretary for the NAACP, who was killed by a sniper's bullet in
front of his Jackson, Miss., home on June 12, 1963.
   Both trials ended with the all-white juries unable to reach a
verdict, and the murder charge was dismissed in 1969. The case was
reopened in 1990 amid charges of jury and evidence tampering in
those trials.
   Beckwith, an avowed racist, has denied killing Evers and
contends the indictment is ``nonsense, poppycock and just something
to stir the people up ... and incite the lower forms of life.''
   Beckwith, who has lived on nearby Signal Mountain for nearly
eight years, was arrested on a fugitive warrant Dec. 17 after a
Hinds County, Miss., grand jury indicted him again.
   Beckwich, who vowed to fight extradition ``tooth, nail and
claw,'' had been free on $15,000 bond since a Dec. 18 hearing
before Hamilton County General Sessions Judge H. L. Smith.
   Smith had ordered Beckwith to return to court Feb. 22, but the
quick processing of the governor's warrant, which was signed by
both Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus and Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter,
eliminates the need for that appearance.
   Beckwith ``is now ready to travel unless he can block it through
some legal maneuver,'' Hammond said.
   Beckwith did not resist when two officers served the warrant
Monday morning at his home, Hammond said. ``I think he was
surprised it was this soon, but I think he's been expecting to hear
something,'' he said.
   Beckwith's wife, Thelma, said her husband had vowed to ``stand
taller than any of them'' if he is extradited.
   ``This is not fair to him,'' she said. ``There is a certain
political element that is doing this to him. It's politically
motivated.''
   Sheriff's deputies were not allowing telephone calls to Beckwith
on Monday.

<HEAD>Bouterse Offered Reinstatement as Suriname's Military Chief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cmdr. Desi Bouterse, Suriname's most
powerful figure the past decade, has been asked to return as its
military chief by a government selected by coup leaders, political
sources said Monday.
   The sources said the military asked President Johan Kraag, who
took office over the weekend replacing ousted President Ramsewak
Shankar, to reinstate Bouterse as commander of the armed forces.
   ``It's just a formality. Bouterse will accept,'' the sources
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Bouterse, a former dictator, officially resigned as army chief
hours before the Christmas Eve coup that overthrew Shankar.
Bouterse was widely believed to have been behind the coup, and his
reinstatement would seem to confirm that view.
   President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela said Monday that his
country had broken relations with Suriname because its government
``brings shame upon the dignity of the Americas.''
   Perez, in his New Year's Eve address in Caracas, compared
Suriname with Kuwait and called it ``intolerable'' that the world
risked war over ``a small nation in the gulf'' yet overlooked the
unseating of democracy in Suriname.
   Suriname's military has promised to hold popular elections
within 100 days of the coup, with Kraag, a veteran politician, as
the interim president.
   The ethnically diverse nation of 400,000 people on the northeast
coast of South America is a former colony of the Netherlands that
won independence in 1975. It has suffered a progressive economic
crisis since 1980, the year Bouterse staged a coup.
   The Dutch government suspended a $1.5 billion aid program after
Bouterse killed 15 of his political opponents in 1982. The economy
has also been hurt by a guerrilla war and plunging world prices for
bauxite, the main export.
   In 1987, a three-party coalition led by Shankar defeated
Bouterse's candidate in popular elections.
   Shankar took office the next year, but Bouterse remained as army
chief and chairman of the five-man Military Authority, the
equivalent of a military high command.
   Shankar and Bouterse have often been at odds and their feud
culminated last week. Bouterse accused Shankar of colluding with
Dutch authorities who refused to grant him a visa when he landed at
the Amsterdam airport.

<HEAD>Air Force Denies Report of Bomber Production Freeze</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force on Monday denied a published
report that it has abandoned plans to build more B-2 stealth
bombers in 1991.
   The Wall Street Journal said Air Force Secretary Donald Rice had
decided to freeze B-2 production at the current level of 15 planes,
and that the $4.1 billion approved by Congress for the B-2 program
in 1991 would be spent to continue assembling and testing only
those planes already approved for production.
   The Air Force issued a brief statement in response to the
Journal report.
   ``No final decision on how the Air Force will apply fiscal year
1991 B-2 funds has been made,'' the statement said, adding that
Congress would be notified once the decision is made.
   The Air Force said it remains ``strongly committed'' to pursuing
the full production run of 75 B-2 bombers as approved by Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney, and that it believes ``the revolutionary
advantages of stealth'' radar-evading technology will be borne out
in 1991.
   ``The B-2 continues to enjoy the confidence of the Air Force and
remains its highest priority,'' the statement said.
   The B-2 incorporates much novel technology and has been plagued
by cost overruns as a result. Each plane of the production run of
75 would cost an estimated $850 million.
   The Air Force said it is still trying to figure out the intent
of Congress on the B-2. Until the last minute, the House version of
the defense budget barred construction of the 16th and 17th B-2,
which the Pentagon had planned for the current year, while the
Senate version authorized those planes.
   The compromise version that was signed by President Bush was
silent on the issue. Some members of the House have said the
Pentagon may not spend money on the additional aircraft while other
members have said the Pentagon could go ahead in the absence of an
explicit prohibition.

   Iraq on Monday ordered 17-year-olds to report for military duty,
the youngest yet to be called for possible combat in the Persian
Gulf. European officials indicated they were ready to hold both
direct and indirect talks with Iraq.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will probably visit Saudi
Arabia and other gulf nations to consult with U.S. allies before
the United Nations' Jan. 15 deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait, a Bush administration official said Monday in Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia.
   Baker may expand his visit to include Europe, said the official,
who was traveling with Vice President Dan Quayle on a three-day
visit to Saudi Arabia.
   World leaders, in New Year's messages, expressed hopes for peace
in the gulf. President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev praised international resolve in confronting Saddam
Hussein. Japan held out the prospect of renewed financial aid if
Iraq quits Kuwait.
   On ships at sea and in desert encampments in Saudi Arabia, tens
of thousands of American troops marked another holiday far from
home. Like last week's Christmas celebrations, New Year's Eve
festivities in the desert were muted and alcohol-free in deference
to Saudi sensibilities.
   French troops toasted the new year with ``Saudi champagne'' -
apple juice and Perrier.
   Quayle called U.S. front-line troops in Saudi Arabia ``heroes''
and told them ``the whole world will be grateful'' if they fight to
drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
   A day earlier, Quayle lobbied Saudi leaders to come up with more
money to help pay for the huge U.S. gulf deployment, expected to
reach 420,000 troops in the next few weeks. Senior administration
officials said King Fahd gave assurances that the kingdom would
provide more cash and services to support the multinational force.
   With only two weeks remaining before the U.N. deadline for Iraq
to withdraw from Kuwait or face potential military action, the
Europeans were leading fresh efforts to talk instead of fight.
   European Community foreign ministers plan to meet in emergency
session on Friday to discuss the gulf crisis, and Luxembourg's
foreign minister, Jacques Poos, said Monday that some might push
for a meeting between him and his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz.
   Luxembourg will take over the EC's rotating chairmanship on
Tuesday.
   Poos said if the foreign ministers decided to send him to
Baghdad for talks, he would be ready to go. The community in
December canceled a meeting with Aziz after the United States and
Iraq failed to agree on dates for direct talks.
   Poos also said in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corp. he expected there would be contact with Iraq either ``through
diplomatic channels or a private talk.'' In Bonn, German officials
speaking on condition of anonymity also raised the possibility of
``indirect talks'' with Iraq.
   But the Europeans sought to dispel any notion they were
splitting away from the U.S.-led alliance against Iraq. Luxembourg
Prime Minister Jacques Santer said Friday's meeting should reaffirm
EC solidarity with the international coalition.
   In another piece of stage-setting for the EC talks, Jordan's
King Hussein was to travel to Europe this week, and Jordanian
officials said he still hoped for a peaceful resolution of the
crisis.
   ``Time is running out and we do not want to see war erupting in
this region,'' a high-ranking Jordanian official said on condition
of anonymity.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, in a New Year's address,
said comprehensive talks on Mideast problems including the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict could come only after an Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   ``It's necessary that Iraq must be convinced - Kuwait occupied,
nothing possible; Kuwait evacuated, everything can happen,''
Mitterrand said.
   Bush and Gorbachev, in televised New Year's greetings, hailed
international solidarity in the face of the gulf crisis.
   ``I applaud, the world applauds, the decisive action of the
Soviet Union in strongly opposing Saddam Hussein's brutal
aggression in the gulf,'' Bush said.
   Gorbachev said the international community ``should find
strength to overcome this obstacle, not to discontinue the advance
toward a peaceful period of civilization.''
   The Japanese offer to resume financial aid to Baghdad came in a
broadcast by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, taped for New Year's
broadcast.
   ``I hope that Iraq will make a decision for a peaceful solution.
If it does, then Japan is prepared to extend economic
cooperation,'' he said.
   Japan, once Iraq's biggest aid donor, froze nearly $3 billion in
assistance after the invasion.
   Iraq's order for 17-year-old males to report for military duty
was the fourth major callup of reserves since it seized Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   It was unclear how many draftees were involved, but it was one
more indication of Baghdad's growing preparations for possible war.
Iraqi officials disclosed Monday that civil defense drills were
conducted in recent days in a northern province along the border
with Turkey.
   In other developments Monday:
   -The Pentagon said five U.S. troops died in separate incidents
in the Persian Gulf in recent days. The deaths raise to 93 the
number of American troops who have died in Operation Desert Shield.
   -PLO chairman Yasser Arafat said Israel is pushing the United
States into a war against Iraq to serve its own ends. ``We are not
reading the future, but this is what Israel wants - to annihilate
Iraq's military and technical power,'' Arafat said in an interview
with The Associated Press in Baghdad.

<HEAD>Court Rules Historic Commission Designation Violates Freedom of
Religion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A landmark commission's attempt to regulate
changes inside a Jesuit church in the city's historic South End
violated the free exercise of religion, the state's highest court
ruled Monday.
   ``The government interest in historic preservation, though
worthy, is not sufficiently compelling to justify restraints on the
free exercise of religion, a right of primary importance,'' the
state Supreme Judicial Court said in a unanimous opinion.
   The dispute revolved around the designation of the interior of
the Church of the Immaculate Conception as a landmark. ``There are
fewer finer examples of classic mid-19th century church design,''
the court said in its opinion.
   The National Trust for Historic Preservation, the American
Jewish Congress and the Council on Religious Freedom were among
groups that filed friend of the court briefs in the case.
   In 1986, the Jesuits developed a plan to renovate the aging
church and build an office, counseling and residential space.
   When the renovation work began, 10 registered city voters
promptly petitioned the Boston Landmarks Commission to designate
the interior of the 127-year-old church as a landmark.
   The granite church is located near Boston City Hospital, and
once served Boston College students before the school moved out of
the city, said Father Paul Kenney, a spokesman for the Society of
Jesus of New England.
   ``It's overall impression is one of light,'' Kenney said of the
structure's interior.
   In 1987, the commission approved the landmark designation for
portions of the church. The designation made any permanent
alteration of the nave, vestibule, chancel and organ loft on the
main floor, as well as other architectural details, subject to the
commission's approval.
   Under the designation, the Jesuits were only allowed to install
non-permanent furnishings and to conduct routine maintenance inside
the church.
   The commission eventually allowed the Jesuits to make some
renovations to the interior. But in the meantime, the Jesuits filed
a lawsuit contending the landmark designation was unconstitutional.
   In a unanimous ruling, the Supreme Judicial Court agreed. But
the court framed the decision narrowly, referring only to a section
of the Massachusetts constitution.
   The decision did not refer to federal guarantees of religious
freedom. The court also made no ruling on the preservation of
church exteriors, noting the case dealt only with a church
interior.
   ``Under our hierarchy of constitutional values we must accept
the possible loss of historically significant elements of the
interior of this church as the price of safeguarding the right of
religious freedom,'' the court said.
   Edward Hanify, an attorney who represented the Jesuits, said the
case represents a key decision for all denominations.
   ``I'm delighted that we have what I would say is a historic and
compelling decision about religious freedom,'' Hanify said.
   John Kenneth Felter, the attorney for the landmark commission,
said he could not comment on the case until he discussed the
outcome with his clients.
   Andrea Ferster, an attorney for the National Trust for Historic
Preservation, said the ruling is narrow enough so that its impact
nationally is muted.

   Hundreds of Albanians trekked across
frozen mountains and rivers Monday to seek refuge in Greece despite
the promise of reforms by their Communist government. Albanian Jews
also were leaving for Israel.
   Meanwhile, a government spokesman announced that Prime Minister
Constantine Mitsotakis will pay a two-day visit to Albania on Jan.
13. He will be the first Greek prime minister to visit Albania.
   Military sources in this northwestern Greek border town said
more than 600 Albanians, most of them ethnic Greeks, had crossed
the frontier since daybreak.
   More than 700 braved sub-freezing temperatures, snow and craggy
terrain to walk across the frontier Sunday, bringing the weekend
total to more than 1,500.
   ``It's been increasing geometrically in the last few days. I
have the distinct impression that they have opened the borders,''
regional police chief Brigadier Andreas Vergis said as he struggled
to count the Albanians swarming into his three-room police station.
   Many refugees said they encountered no resistance on the
frontier and that they began the journey after hearing by
word-of-mouth that they would not be shot if they tried to cross
the border. Some said guards also were defecting, allowing the flow
of refugees to snowball along the once tightly guarded frontier.
   But in Tirana, the Albanian capital, a government official
described as absurd reports alleging that the country's border is
being opened for visa-free passage. The official warned people
against trying to cross it ``by force.''
   Albanian radio, monitored in London by the British Broadcasting
Corp., said the reports of the border opening were made by foreign
media in an attempt to incite Albanians to leave the country
illegally.
   In addition to the ethnic Greeks, many in Albania's small Jewish
community were making their way out. Israeli media reported Monday
that four Albanian Jewish families had arrived in Israel and dozens
more were expected in coming weeks.
   Israel radio said the Jewish immigration was made possible by a
recent agreement between Italy and Albania, the last of the
hard-line Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. But Italian
government officials reached Monday said they had no knowledge of
any such agreement.
   The Italian Embassy in Tirana said it had issued 37 visas for
Albanian Jews and that it did not have any applications for others.
   Israeli government officials were tight-lipped about the
immigration of Albanian Jews, apparently fearful of harming the
effort.
   ``This is going to save Albanian Jews from total extinction. Had
they remained there, they would have been wiped out in a
generation,'' said Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum, a consultant to the
American Jewish Committee in New York.
   The Albanian Jewish community numbers only about 1,000,
officials said.
   Greek Foreign Minister Andonis Samaras appealed to ethnic Greeks
to remain in Albania ``and enjoy the fruits of democracy'' as
reforms are introduced.
   The Albanian government of President Ramiz Alia has promised
such reforms as allowing religious services and the establishment
of opposition parties. But the refugees say they do not have faith
in the promises.
   ``We didn't believe Alia,'' said Zisis Karkasainas, a
26-year-old economics graduate.
   Greek officials estimate about 350,000 of Albania's 3.3 million
people are ethnic Greeks. The strain of the sudden influx can
already be seen in the border towns.
   ``I've been working 24 hours a day for a week now. We don't have
enough food for all these people,'' said a woman who identified
herself only as Anastasia. She was in charge of a kitchen in an old
orphanage that has been trying to feed all the Albanians who have
crossed the border in the last two days.
   Dozens of refugees waited in a long line outside the orphange.
   Police estimated that 95 percent of the Albanians who crossed
the border are ethnic Greeks who lived in frontier villages. Ethnic
Greeks are given temporary residence permits while the other
Albanians are taken to a United Nations refugee center outside
Athens.
   Most of them crossed the border near Filiates, a town of 5,000,
because the terrain is less mountainous than elsewhere along the
100-mile border.
   ``They should declare a state of emergency up here, we can't
cope any more,'' said Father Zilis, the town priest. He and three
other residents formed a committee to help the refugees with food,
clothing and shelter.
   The mayor, Pantelis Koufalas, on Sunday sent a telex to Premier
Constantine Mitsotakis pleading for assistance.
   A small Greek army border detachment began cooking for the
refugees after a makeshift soup kitchen ran out of food and groups
of refugees tried to force their way into the orphanage.
   ``Look at them, your heart breaks, but what more can we do?''
committee member Nikolas Georgopoulos said.
   Most of the refugees, wearing donated clothes, sat in the mud
outside the orphanage.
   Shepherd Ilias Bouros brought his wife, two infant children, a
65-year-old grandmother and a nephew to Greece from the town of
Sarande.
   ``I walked 18 hours to get here, with my family,'' he said.
``We're tired but happy to get out of Albania.''

<HEAD>Police Fire on Rioting Prisoners; 1 Killed, 15 Wounded</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>

   Jail guards opened fire Monday on
hundreds of rioting prisoners, killing at least one inmate and
wounding 15 prisoners, police and news reports said.
   The prisoners demanded former President Hussain Muhammad Ershad
be hanged and claimed they were unfairly imprisoned under martial
law. They wanted to speak to leaders of the opposition coalition
that forced Ershad's resignation Dec. 6.
   The riot in this southeastern port's main prison followed a
similar incident Saturday in Dhaka in which three prisoners were
fatally shot by prison guards.
   Officials at the Chittagong Central Jail said prisoners
brandishing iron rods and and sticks attacked policemen who were
serving dinner.
   At least 20 policemen were injured in the violence that appears
to have been inspired by the Dhaka Central Jail riot, said the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not
immediately clear how the prisoners armed themselves, they said.
   Hundreds of prisoners rampaged through the jail, disconnected
the electricity and broke open doors of several cells, releasing
``dangerous prisoners,'' the officials said.
   The United News of Bangladesh news agency said two prisoners
were killed in the firing.
   Chittagong Police Chief Wahidul Huq confirmed one death and
injuries to 15 to 20 prisoners. The conflicting death toll could
not be immediately reconciled.
   ``It may take time to persuade the prisoners to return to their
lockups,'' a senior jail official said speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   He said 2,190 prisoners were packed in the jail meant for 726
people.
   In Dhaka, 135 miles northwest of Chittagong, chaos continued in
the Dhaka Central Jail.
   On Monday, prisoners handed over to authorities the decomposing
bodies of the three inmates who were killed Saturday, jail
officials said. At least 100 more inmates were injured when police
there opened fire to stop an attempted jailbreak by 4,800 inmates.
  The prisoners refused to return to their cells and also asked to
talk to leaders of the two top political parties.
   There was no immediate comment from the two top politicians,
Sheik Hasina of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party.
   At least 22 inmates have escaped amid the administrative
collapse that followed the riots, news reports said Monday.

<HEAD>Incoming Gov Faces Fiscal Crisis Similar To One Dukakis Found</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Cuomo's Third Term, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Gov. Michael S. Dukakis took over
Massachusetts from a Republican governor, the economy was spiraling
downward and the state budget was mired in red ink.
   Sixteen years later, Dukakis passes the reins to another
Republican and returns the fiscal favor. The economy is in the
cellar and the Duke's successor, William Weld, faces painful budget
cuts or tax increases.
   Dukakis leaves office Thursday as the longest serving governor
in state history. His three-term tenure - interrupted for four
years from 1979 to 1983 - is studded with accomplishments and
controversy, political heights and electoral disaster.
   But the fiscal and economic condition of Massachusetts that
Dukakis leaves behind mirrors the circumstances he inherited in
1975 as a hard-charging, can-do reformer.
   ``It looks to me, as an outsider, as though it's a hell of a lot
worse mess now,'' said former Gov. Francis W. Sargent, who planned
to attend Thursday's inaugural and welcome in the first Republican
governor of Massachusetts since he lost to Dukakis.
   ``When the Duke came in, I think he had an idea that he was
going to be able to bring the budget home and spread it out on the
kitchen table and figure out where he could cut,'' Sargent said.
   Dukakis promised no new taxes in his 1974 gubernatorial
campaign. And when he took office he adopted as a symbol a meat
cleaver that he said would be needed to cut state government down
to size. He promised ``a Herculean effort to reduce expenditures,
to eliminate waste.''
   But Dukakis and his fiscal advisers discovered that the state
was in deep financial trouble. Hundreds of millions in Medicaid
bills were unpaid, the state welfare department was in debt. A
modest surplus of six months earlier became, early in 1975, a
deficit of between $350 million and $500 million - a huge chunk in
a state who's total budget was about $3 billion.
   With unemployment at 11.2 percent and with oil prices soaring
amid the Arab oil embargo, the state economy was in no condition to
bail out state government.
   Less than a year after taking office, Dukakis had to eat his
campaign promise and back the largest tax increase in the state's
history.
   The parallels in Massachusetts today are startling.
   Oil prices are again on the rise, pushed by a different crisis
in the Mideast. Unemployment is increasing, though it has not yet
reached the double-digit levels of the mid-1970s. And, once again,
the problems confronting Massachusetts coincide with a national
economic slump and with similar fiscal crises elsewhere.
   Dukakis disputes those who predict he will leave behind a large
deficit.
   ``There is no comparison,'' Dukakis said in an interview Monday.
``In 1975 we were looking at a budget deficit that was 25 percent
of the total.''
   In the past few months, Dukakis has been able to present his
successor with a detailed appraisal of the state's fiscal
condition.
   ``In '75 we didn't have that kind of information,'' Dukakis
said. ``Nobody paid attention to monthly revenue estimates back
then.''
   Still, Massachusetts does face the prospect of a sizable
deficit. Some state legislators have estimated the state would wind
up some $300 million in the red at the end of the fiscal year next
June. Governor-elect Weld said this week his advisers put the
deficit as high as $750 million.
   Weld bound himself to a no-new-taxes promise. Much as Dukakis
did in 1975, Weld is talking about laying off public employees to
balance the books.
   And the state Legislature is in no mood to consider a tax
increase.
   In 1975, the Legislature was dominated by liberal Democrats who
had no qualms about raising taxes and, indeed, urged Dukakis to
abandon his no-new-taxes pledge.
   Today's Legislature still has a majority of Democrats and some
surviving liberals. But they're wary of voters who are in no mood
to shell out more tax dollars.

<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six prominent Saudi men, in a rare
public airing of views, spoke Monday of overzealous religious
police, a demonstration by women drivers that backfired and fears
that war would destroy their country.
   The significance of the news conference was not so much in the
Saudis' views - which largely reflect the government's positions -
but in the fact that they agreed to talk on the record. News
conferences by Saudi citizens were unheard of before Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait because few journalists were allowed into the
country and because Saudis are reluctant to freely state their
opinions.
   The hour-long news conference covered everything from gas masks
for foreign workers to the possibility of a permanent U.S. military
presence in Saudi Arabia, as well as windfall profits from rising
oil prices and production.
   But it was the possibility of war with Iraq - an Arab brother
nation that the Saudis had supported with $20 billion during the
eight-year war with Iran - that stirred their emotions.
   The United Nations has set a deadline of Jan. 15 for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait or face a possible military attack.
   Salih A. Al-Toaimi, secretary general of the Chamber of Commerce
in Riyadh, said he was praying for ``a miracle'' - that Saddam
Hussein will withdraw peacefully from Kuwait.
   ``I personally think it will happen,'' he said.
   ``Nobody wants war. I think the highest price ever paid by
everybody will be much, much cheaper than the consequences of war
so we all should do our best to avoid it,'' he said. ``All people
... are concerned and hate to see our country, and even Iraq,
destroyed.''
   Dr. Ali Al-Namlah, an associate professor at Imam Mohammed Bin
Saud Islamic University in Riyadh, said the Saudis are ready
psychologically to face the consequences of war, but hope for
peace.
   ``We are waiting for miracles to happen. We are waiting for a
tough decision by the ruler of Iraq,'' he said.
   The deployment of more than 300,000 U.S. troops has opened a
window, however small, in this conservative Moslem country, where
alcohol is banned and women must be completely covered in public.
   Dr. Fahad Al-Samari, a professor of economics and political
science at the Islamic University, said he had studied the presence
of U.S. troops in Vietnam and there was a definite difference in
their behavior here.
   ``We have seen the American troops are behaving very well,'' he
said. ``They have been briefed. They are following the rules,
respecting the culture, respecting the Saudis, respecting the norms
and traditions here.''
   But like the other Saudis, he said, all foreign troops must
leave as soon as Kuwait is liberated and the country must build a
large army to defend itself.
   ``Every society doesn't want any foreigners to stay in that
military aspect,'' he explained. ``If you have a house and you have
a soldier by your house, you want it from the family, not outside
the family who doesn't know your system or understand you.''
   The Ministry of Information arranged the news conference in
response to requests from some of the hundreds of journalists
covering the U.S. military buildup who wanted to get a Saudi
civilian perspective on the Gulf crisis. All six of the
participants spoke fluent English.
   Since the arrival of U.S. troops, there has been a Western-style
demonstration by about 40 Saudi women who drove through Riyadh to
protest a ban on women driving.
   There has also been a crackdown by the religious police, called
the muttawa, who have invaded several private homes where parties
were being held.
   Al-Namlah said the muttawa's role was to ``control society for
anything which violates Islamic law'' and they probably had
authorization to break into people's homes.
   But Ibrahim Al-Touq, chairman of the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce,
said the muttawa just had a role in keeping certain traditions and
religious teachings and ``in certain instances I think they overdo
it.''
   ``Many Saudis don't agree with people breaking into houses
without any reason,'' he said. ``We were very much concerned about
this becoming more extreme - or more the rule rather than the
exception - and we expressed our views to the departments concerned
and I'm sure they understood the concern of the people.''
   Although there is nothing in Islamic law against women driving,
the ban is a Saudi tradition and Al-Touqsaid the women should have
tested public opinion first and tried to win support instead of
springing the protest.
   ``The very conservative people were surprised and were scared of
such a thing. They thought this was maybe the beginning of, let's
say, a revolution, or something very bad happening,'' he said.
   Some of the women who were professors have been suspended from
their jobs, and all the women have been banned from traveling
outside the country.

   A young Arab woman was killed Monday when a
bomb she apparently was carrying exploded in a public toilet at the
crowded Mahane Yehuda outdoor market in Jewish West Jerusalem,
police said.
   She was the only casualty and little damage was caused other
than a broken toilet window.
   Shahar Ayalon, a senior police officer, said a bag of vegetables
was found beside the woman, and ``it is reasonable to assume that
she intended to plant the bomb in the bag and place it on one of
the adjacent streets.''
   Police Commissioner Yaacov Terner linked the explosion to
increased Palestinian protests expected for Tuesday's anniversary
of the first armed attack in Israel by the mainstream Fatah faction
of the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1965.
   ``I have no doubt it is connected,'' Terner told Israel radio.
   Authorities added police reinforcements and imposed widespread
curfews on the occupied territories to head off violence.
   The underground leadership of the 3-year-old uprising against
Israeli occupation urged marches, firebomb-throwing and lighting of
torches for the anniversary.
   ``We salute the revolution of the rifles, the revolution of
armed struggle,'' said a leaflet issued Monday by the PLO-backed
uprising leaders.
   Also Monday, police arrested a 19-year-old Israeli and said he
confessed to shooting and wounding a Palestinian doctor; the
doctor's sister and her 9-month-old daughter last week in the West
Bank, Israel radio reported.
   The attack caused a furor among Palestinians since a previously
unknown group calling itself the Jewish Avengers claimed
responsibility and pledged to carry out more such actions.
   The suspect's name was not released, but police told Israel
radio the man acted alone as revenge for the slaying of a relative
by an Arab. The national news agency Itim said he was a soldier
whose brother was fatally stabbed by a Palestinian.
   Police identified Monday's explosion victim as a 24-year-old
Palestinian woman from the Bethlehem area in the occupied West
Bank, but refused to give her name.
   Palestinians said she was Amal Mustafa Itabbi, a resident of the
Aida refugee camp who was pregnant and married to a man jailed for
15 months during the uprising.
   The explosion occurred about 11:30 a.m.
   ``Apparently the person who was handling the charge was killed
in this toilet stall,'' Terner said.
   He said she was alone and was ``torn to pieces'' by the
explosion, but shopkeeper Meir Cohen said she was still alive
moments after the blast.
   Cohen said he ran into the toilet and found her under a fallen
door. ``She was alive, the woman. I lifted her head. She moved her
head as if she wanted to speak, wanted help,'' he said.
   Appeals over the market's public address system warned shoppers
to ``be wary of suspicious packages and report anything suspicious
to the police.''
   Knots of young men gathered, many of them ultra-orthodox Jews,
waving fists and chanting ``Death to the Arabs!''
   For the 22nd time during the uprising, the seaside Gaza Strip,
home to 750,000 Palestinians, was placed under virtually blanket
curfew, as was Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, and many
villages and refugee camps.

   Israel's 200,000th immigrant of 1990 stepped
off the airplane on Monday into a celebration that some immigration
officials called inappropriate.
   Igor Goldfarb, 25, an engineer from the Ural Mountains region in
the Soviet Union, was met by Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz,
Housing Minister Ariel Sharon and other legislators.
   Peretz handed Goldfarb an Israeli flag as an accordion played
and Sharon said, ``I hope that in the not too distant future we
will be standing here and celebrating the arrival of the 2
millionth immigrant.''
   Goldfarb and his mother plan to live with his brother, who has
an apartment in Petah Tikva. He told reporters in Russian he wants
to marry an Israeli.
   About 90 percent of the immigrants who came in 1990 are Soviets.
Officials say they expect 400,000 Soviets to arrive in each of the
coming two years.
   Missing from Monday's singing and dancing was Simha Dinitz,
chief of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, responsible for
transporting and absorbing immigrants.
   Dinitz said he would celebrate only after Israel successfully
absorbed all prospective immigrants, granting them housing and
employment.
   ``We are very happy and glad that so many people are coming,''
said Jewish Agency spokesman Gad Ben Ari. ``But this is the time
for work and not for celebrating.''
   Dinitz's absence underlined government inability to agree on how
to handle the wave of Soviet Jews expected to total 1 million in
the next two years.
   Israel's population now is about 4.5 million.
   Sharon, chairman of a special Cabinet committee overseeing
immigrant absorption, disparaged a plan Peretz introduced on Sunday
to put immigrants in tent camps.
   ``I don't find anything clever in this idea,'' Sharon told
Israel radio Monday. He urged instead that Israelis with unrented
apartments make them available to immigrants until new housing is
built.
   Plans for starting construction on 45,000 new housing units in
1990 have been derailed by similar disagreements and bureaucratic
delays.
   Peretz has refused to attend meetings of Sharon's committee, and
Soviet immigrants groups have accused the government of failing to
anticipate the strain on housing, jobs and social services.
   Israelis also grumble about the burden they have to bear as the
government plans to raise taxes and cut the minimum wage.
   ``From the minute the immigrants will come it will get worse.
Our youth will be pushed aside and first of all the immigrants will
be taken care of,'' Shimon Mizrahi said on Israel television.
   Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai said Monday that as more
immigrants pour in, the Israeli public have to make bigger
sacrifices.
   The national insurance company Bituach Leumi released its annual
report Monday counting 118,000 families below the poverty line, and
said 110,000 more families would fall into poverty in 1991 if the
burden on the population increased, Israel TV said.
   The rush of immigration follows liberalized exit policies by the
Soviet government and tighter rules for entry into the United
States.
   Some officials say immigration totals could hit 1 million in
1991 alone.
   Legislator Michael Kleiner, chairman of Parliament's immigration
committee, left Monday for Ethiopia and said he hoped all 20,000
Ethiopian Jews could be brought to Israel in the next year.
   The small community of about 1,000 Albanian Jews also has begun
emigrating under liberalized policies in the Eastern European
country.
   Peretz calls inadequate Sharon's plan for putting immigrants in
rental apartments and mobile homes.
   Sharon said Israel managed to house the many immigrants who
arrived in the past year - ``We absorbed 200,000 people and no one
is out on the street.''
   New arrivals are being housed in army camps and hotels.

   The U.N. Security Council held urgent
consultations Monday about violence in the occupied territories but
failed to agree on a PLO statement condemning killings by Israeli
security forces.
   It was the council's final session of 1990.
   A resurgence of violence in which more Palestinians died could
put Israel and the Security Council on a collision course and
pressure the council to impose sanctions on Israel, as it has upon
Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait.
   Israel thwarted U.N. efforts to investigate after at least 17
Palestinians were killed in rioting on Temple Mount on Oct. 8. That
lead to a council decision to involve itself in Israel's treatment
of Palestinians and to request the secretary-general to conduct
urgent monitoring of their treatment.
   ``It is time for the United Nations to act and to implement
relevant resolutions protecting Palestinians. But unfortunately,
the United States blocked action by the council,'' said M. Nasser
Al-Kidwa, acting U.N. observer of Palestine.
   U.S. diplomats declined comment but Western diplomats said they
would seek more time for study before approving a hastily proposed
statement requiring consensus by the entire 15-member council. The
sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Yemen, outgoing president of the council for December, called
the meeting to discuss what it said were the shooting deaths of six
Palestinians and the wounding of 120 over the weekend. The Israeli
army said four Palestinians were killed and 90 wounded in the
unrest. It amended its earlier report that five were killed, saying
one death turned out to be from a heart attack.
   The latest violence was reported to stem from anniversary
celebrations of the first armed attack in Israel by Fatah, the
mainstream branch of the Palestine Liberation Organization, on Jan.
1, 1965.
   Diplomats said after closed consultations that no agreement
emerged, that the United States sought more factual information
about the violence and Britain and other governments did not have
instructions.
   The issue is expected to be considered this week when Zaire
becomes council president for January.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar issued a statement
from an undisclosed vacation site, saying he was ``deeply
concerned'' by weekend clashes in the Gaza Strip, where
Palestinians ``were shot and killed and many were injured by
Israeli security forces.''
   He asked the U.N. Relief Works Agency, which cars for
Palestinian refugees, for information about incidents that occurred
in Palestinian refugee camps.
   General Assembly President Guido de Marco will visit refugee
camps in the occupied territories and in Jordan from Wednesday
through Monday.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War and still occupies those
territories.

   President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo said
Monday that Guatemala is prepared to extradite three men wanted on
drug charges in the United States if courts approve the
extraditions.
   U.S. officials are seeking the extradition of Zacapa Mayor
Arnoldo Vargas Estrada and businessmen Victor Manuel Escobar and
Otto Quiroz, who were arrested Thursday and are charged with
conspiring to ship cocaine to the United States.
   The defense minister, Gen. Juan Leonel Bolanos Flores, told
reporters Monday the government had received another request to
extradite three military officers who were recently dishonorably
discharged because of drug allegations.
   But James Dickmeyer, a spokesman for the U.S. embassy, said he
was unaware of any extradition request for the three military
officers.
   The cases of former Col. Carlos Rene Ochoa Ruiz and Capts.
Leonel Perez Franco and Jose Maria Flores Montes are now before
Guatemalan civilian courts.
   Under Guatemalan law, extradition petitions go to the supreme
court, which assigns the case to a lower court judge for study. If
he finds the petition has legal merit, it goes to the president,
who decides whether to approve or deny the request.
   Vargas was arrested in Zacapa, 90 miles east of the capital.
Police said they confiscated 287 kilos of cocaine valued at $57.4
million.
   Vargas, 52, was recently re-elected to a five-year term as mayor
on the National Center Union ticket.
   He has claimed the drug charges are a frame-up to discredit his
party's presidential candidate, Jorge Carpio Nicolle, who faces
Jorge Serrano Elias in a Jan. 6 runoff election.
   In early December, Guatemalan citizen Rufino Arriaza Cordova was
extradited to Miami to face drug charges.

   Dame Joan Sutherland, one of the great sopranos of
the century, bade an emotional farewell to her British admirers at
the Royal Opera House on New Year's Eve.
   Dame Joan was showered Monday with bouquets thrown from the
orchestra stalls and with carnations from the boxes above the stage
when she sang with her friends Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti and
American mezzo soprano Marilyn Horne.
   At one point Dame Joan wept as Pavarotti sang directly to her.
   The 64-year-old Australian diva offically retired in a
performance at Sydney Opera House in October but expressed a wish
to sing once more in Covent Garden, where she made her debut in
1952.
   The opera house arranged a special interlude in ``Die
Fledermaus'' by Johann Strauss so the three singers could appear
together.

<HEAD>President Pledges End to Lebanese Civil War Amid Cabinet Boycott</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Elias Hrawi pledged Monday to
accelerate the peaceful reconciliation of Lebanon's 15-year-old
civil war, but three leading Christian Cabinet members boycotted
the New Year's address.
   ``We shall consolidate security in greater Beirut and transform
it into a dynamic peace proces to bring the civil war to an end,''
Hrawi said in his address, broadcast nationwide on radio and
television.
   ``Your newly formed government is committed to accelerating the
process of peace to regain Lebanon's full sovereignty over its
entire territory,'' Hrawi said.
   In November, militias withdrew from Beirut and handed control of
the capital to the government as a first step toward ending the
civil war that has claimed 150,000 lives.
   `The capital is now united in greater Beirut with the army in
full control and all militias out,'' Hrawi said.
   But seven of the Cabinet's 30 members were absent from the
Monday night meeting.
   At least three of them - Telecommunications Minister George
Saadeh of the Phalange Party, Labor Minister Michel Sassin of the
Liberal Party, and Minister without Portfolio Samir Geagea of the
Lebanese Forces - boycotted the meeting.
   Geagea and Saadeh, both leaders of righ-wing Christian groups,
have said they would reject their appointments in the government.
They have said the government is pro-Syrian and therefore incapable
of ending the civil war.
   Sassin had said he would not take his post unless Geagea and
Saadeh assumed theirs.
   In his speech, Hrawi called on the three to join the government.
His aides said the president was confident that behind-the-scenes
intermediaries would persuade Geagea and Saadeh to drop their
boycott.
   Syria maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon and has strongly backed
Hrawi's government.

<HEAD>Cold in the West Continues, Record Warmth for the East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A bitter cold wave that has blitzed much of the West and the
nation's midsection persisted on the last day of 1990.
   Temperatures dipped below freezing across most of the West early
Monday. Snow and blustery winds brought winter storm warnings to
the Pacific Northwest and the northern Rockies.
   A winter storm warning was in effect through New Year's Day for
parts of northern Idaho, eastern Idaho and northern Montana west of
the Continental Divide.
   Morning lows above freezing were mainly confined to the Gulf
Coast while subzero readings prevailed from the northern and
central Plains to Upper Michigan.
   The coldest spot in the Lower 48 states was Hibbing, Minn.,
where the barometer dipped to 30 below.
   Sunshine and southerly winds helped moderate temperatures in the
central Plains region where readings hovered above freezing at
midday. Sunny skies and light wind prevailed across the Southwest.
   Some of the low records set Monday included 8 below at Delta,
Utah, 18 degrees at Redding, Calif., 26 at Sacramento, Calif., and
7 below at Salt Lake City.
   In stark contrast, early morning temperatures were balmy in the
Southeast, and parts of the middle and northern Atlantic Coast.
   Richmond, Va., recorded a record high for the date of 70 degrees
early Monday, and Portland warmed to 53 degrees.
   Unseasonably warm weather continued ahead of the Arctic front.
Temperatures were still in the 60s and 70s in much of the
southeast, with readings in the 80s over much of Florida.
   A strong northwest wind ushered cold Arctic air into the middle
and northern Atlantic Coast. Wind gusted to 53 mph in Boston and
gusts reached 78 mph at the Blue Hill Observatory.
   The strong wind produced snow squalls in the Great Lakes region.
Light snow showers or snow flurries extended from the Tennessee
Valley to New York state.
   Recent heavy rains in the Ohio valley swelled rivers from
Indiana to New York state. In western Pennsylvania, river flood
warnings are in effect through Tuesday for the Allegheny,
Monongahela and Ohio rivers.

   Millions of people around the globe bade farewell to a
tumultuous 1990 and embraced the new year with fireworks and gala
celebrations, while their leaders appealed for a peaceful solution
to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Paris celebrated the 12th stroke of midnight noisily, with
whistles, honking horns and the pops of thousands of champagne
corks. The Champs-Elysees, Clichy, the Place St. Michel and St.
Germain des Pres were crowded.
   New Year's is traditionally a time in Paris for eating oysters,
and tens of thousands were consumed at the city's best fish bars.
Long lines of tourists formed outside dance halls like the Moulin
Rouge and Lido for midnight shows.
   On the more serious side, President Bush praised warmer
U.S.-Soviet relations and the nations' alliance in the effort to
drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the Cold War was
over, but that there would be no lasting peace until the gulf
crisis was resolved.
   The Iraqi embassy in London wished the world a peaceful and
prosperous new year and complained that a completely different
message emanated from Bush - ``a message of further aggression,
destruction and war. ... As for Iraq, it will always carry the
olive branch and sing songs of peace and curse war.''
   Australians were among the first to ring in 1991. Hundreds of
thousands of partiers jammed Sydney Harbor to watch fireworks and a
laser show.
   Temple bells, ship's whistles and fireworks welcomed the Year of
the Sheep in Tokyo. Millions of Japanese headed for shrines to pray
for success. Others gathered around bonfires at neighborhood
shrines to drink sake, or rice wine.
   Night spots in Beijing reverberated with rap music, love songs
and rock'n'roll. Many Chinese spent New Year's Eve quietly with
friends or relatives, eating special dinners and playing mah-jong
into the early hours.
   China's major new year holiday comes Feb. 15 - the Chinese Lunar
New Year. But most Beijing residents will take off from work
Tuesday and Wednesday, when banks, most shops and government
offices will be closed.
   In Spain, a television electrician accidentally broke the
legendary clock that rings in the Spanish New Year in Madrid's
popular Puerta del Sol square. But it was fixed in time for the
arrival of 1991.
   At midnight on New Year's Eve, Spaniards seek good luck by
swallowing one grape with each of the 12 chimes of the 123-year-old
clock - either gulping the grapes during a huge party in the square
or while watching the live TV or radio broadcast.
   For the first time since the early 19th century, north Dublin in
Ireland was without the New Year bells of St. George's Church,
whose chimes were heard by Leopold and Molly Bloom in James Joyce's
``Ulysses.'' The church was closed in 1990 and its bells sold to a
suburban church.
   Dublin's New Year was ushered in with a peal of ``Grandsire
Triples'' by the ringers of Christ Church Cathedral, with the 12
strokes of midnight tolled on the tenor bell by ringing master
Leslie Taylor.
   Albanian President Ramiz Alia said Monday night he believed 1991
would be a turning point for Albania, and appealed for unity and
order as the Communist-led country moved out of its isolation
toward democratization. His New Year message was broadcast on
Albanian radio.
   On Israel army radio, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir sent Bush
New Year's greetings that wished him victory in the gulf, ``to free
the Middle East from the threat of tyranny and aggression.''
   The mood was somber in Pakistan after Islamic fundamentalists
denounced New Year's Eve celebrations as a product of the decadent
West.
   A group calling itself ``The Tigers of Allah'' strung banners
throughout the city of Karachi, emblazoned with skull-and-crossbone
insignias and the warning: ``Beware.''
   Fundamentalists demanded there be no dancing, drinking or
mingling with the opposite sex at parties. Threats prompted all the
city's hotels to cancel their festivities.
   In Manila, Philippine police went on alert and hospitals
expected casualties from fireworks and the firing of illegal
weapons.
   Germans began their first year in decades under one nation, and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl urged support for Soviet reforms to maintain
peace on the continent.
   ``No one has a bigger interest in that than we Germans in the
heart of Europe,'' Kohl said in a New Year's Eve speech.
   Germany has been the staunchest European supporter of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whom Germans largely credit with
helping eliminate the major obstacles to unification.
   In a message on Soviet television, Kohl extended ``heartfelt
greetings and our good wishes'' to the Soviet people for the New
Year.
   Gorbachev said Monday in his New Year's address to the Soviet
people, ``The passing year was one of the most difficult in our
history.
   ``Crisis phenomena in economics, the lowering of people's
personal safety, a weakening of order and discipline affected the
conditions of life,'' he said in the speech to be broadcast
nationwide just before midnight.
   In a message to Americans, the Soviet president welcomed
February's summit with President Bush and said there was ``no more
danger of nuclear catastrophe.''
   But, he added, ``much has not been completed,'' including a
resolution to the crisis caused by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   In a videotaped greeting to ``all the wonderful people of the
Soviet Union,'' Bush saluted Gorbachev for undertaking ``an arduous
journey'' toward a new society.
   The U.S. president, welcoming the Soviets as partners against
Iraq, hailed the Soviet-American ``common approach to a new
challenge in the name of stability and peace.''
   Bush said he was thrilled about the warmth developing between
ordinary Soviet and American citizens as a result of the relaxation
of tensions.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, in his New Year's Eve
address, also urged Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and the world to
help settle outstanding Middle East disputes, including the
Israeli-Palestinian problem.
   In the Persian Gulf, celebrations were low-key as troops focused
on Jan. 15, the U.N. deadline for Iraq to leave conquered Kuwait or
face possible use of force.
   Iraqis welcomed 1991 with parties and bands in major hotels and
nightspots in Baghdad, but most stayed home and celebrations were
subdued.
   In Tokyo, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu marked the start of the
50th anniversary year of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor with a call
for reflection.
   ``It is important to make clear to the United States and the
world that Japan is determined never again to wage a war of
aggression,'' Kaifu told Japanese reporters in a news conference
taped for a New Year's Day television broadcast.
   Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, brought the
United States into World War II. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15,
1945.

<TEXT>
   Rebels attacked a military
barracks next to the presidential palace only two hours before
their promised cease-fire went into effect Monday. The army said
one soldier was wounded.
   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or
FMLN, launched three rocket-propelled grenades that hit a dormitory
wall in the communications brigade in the southern part of the
capital, the military said.
   The attack apparently violated an earlier, holiday cease-fire
the rebels had said would last through Jan. 1.
   The rebels said Friday they would begin another unilateral
cease-fire starting Monday at 6 a.m. The rebels gave no explanation
for the overlapping cease-fires.
   Rebels said the truce was aimed at reopening peace negotiations
in the 11-year-old Salvadoran civil war that has claimed 73,000
lives.
   They gave the same motive for starting a Nov. 20 offensive,
saying it was necessary to push President Alfredo Cristiani's
right-wing government to the bargaining table.
   Negotiations supervised by the United Nations throughout 1990
stuck on guerrillas' demands for major reductions in the armed
forces and removal of officers and soldiers implicated in human
rights abuses.
   The army doesn't want any outside meddling in its structure.
   The FMLN said its six-week offensive caused 1,190 army deaths
and injuries. The government said 600 died and 1,000 were wounded,
including military, rebels and civilians.
   Rebels for the first time downed two government planes with
surface-to-air missiles during the offensive, alarming both the
Salvadoran government and its U.S. backers. The Salvadoran military
is heavily reliant on its air force to prevent large-scale rebel
attacks.

<HEAD>Berliners Made 1 Billion Marks Off German Unity, Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist-run businesses and currency speculators
in Berlin cost the government $666 million by manipulating aspects
of German unification, an official said Monday.
   Berlin Justice Sen. Jutta Limbach said officials have identified
54 specific cases where people managed to make vast amounts of
money off the economic merger of the German nations.
   But she said it will take at least six months to sift through
evidence needed to bring criminal charges.
   West Germany's powerful currency replaced East Germany's
nonconvertible Communist currency on July 1 and the two nations
united on Oct. 3
   Even though the Communist currency was considered worthless
outside the East bloc, it was exchanged for the Western mark at a
1-1 rate for small personal bank accounts and at a 2-1 rate for
corporate and large accounts.
   Limbach said her office has turned up about 1 billion marks, or
$666 million, in economic damage caused primarily by former
Communist-run businesses that doctored their financial records.
   All of the suspected fraud took place in former East Berlin, she
said, and 700 million marks, or $466 million, in fraud was blamed
on businesses that had Soviet rubles in their bank accounts.
   The government allowed East German businesses to convert rubles
in their bank accounts to West German marks at a 2-1 rate for
recent transactions, even though the ruble was worth only a
fraction of that.
   Officials have charged that many businesses altered their
records to make it look like older transactions took place
recently, allowing the enterprises to convert large amounts of
rubles in their accounts at the 2-1 rate.
   She said other losses were caused by currency speculation and
illegal property sales.
   Officials have said that economic crimes related to German
unification probably will reach billions of marks nationwide.

   George Allen, who transformed
two professional football teams from losers to winners, then came
out of a five-year retirement to take over a struggling,
small-college team, died Monday. He was 72.
   Allen, who coached the Los Angeles Rams and Washington Redskins
of the NFL, also served as chairman of the President's Council on
Physical Fitness from 1981, going on television to exhort Americans
to shape up.
   He died at his home here of natural causes, said his son, Greg.
He is survived by his wife Etty, a daughter and three sons.
   Allen was alone at home when his wife returned in the early
afternoon and found him dead in the kitchen, said Mike Tracy of the
Palos Verdes Estates Police Department. She had last seen him alive
at 10:30 a.m.
   Allen, who also coached two teams with the short-lived USFL in
the early 1980s, had ended a five-year retirement to coach at Long
Beach State in December 1989. He said at the time he missed the
challenge.
   Allen ranks as the winningest coach in team history for both the
Rams and the Redskins and had the third-best winning percentage of
.712 among NFL coaches with 100 or more victories. He was 49-17-4,
or .742, with Los Angeles from 1966 to 1970, and 67-30-1, or .691,
with Washington from 1971 to 1977.
   Although he had excellent records in the pros, he never was able
to produce a National Football League champion. The closest he came
was with the Redskins in the 1972 season, when they lost 14-7 to
the Miami Dolphins in the seventh Super Bowl.
   Allen said his 6-5 winning season at Long Beach State this year
was the most rewarding of his entire career. The team scored 4-8
the previous season.
   In an interview last Thursday, Allen said his health had
suffered since his players drenched him with icewater to celebrate
a season-ending victory over Nevada-Las Vegas. ``We couldn't afford
Gatorade,'' he said, smiling.
   However, Allen had been showing up recently at the practices of
the Iowa Hawkeyes, who were holding drills at Long Beach State in
preparation for Tuesday's Rose Bowl game against Washington. He was
at practice Sunday, and appeared fit and animated.
   Allen's celebrated coaching career, which covered four decades,
began in 1948 at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa. In his
first year, the team had a 3-6 record.
   It was one of only three times he had a losing record, the other
two coming at Whittier College in 1951 and 1954.
   He took over the struggling Los Angeles Rams in 1966 and led the
team to a 8-6 record, their first winning season in eight years.
The next year, the Rams finished first in the division with an
11-1-2 record, Allen's best single-season mark.
   Allen was known for wild spending to build a winner and trading
draft choices for such veterans as defensive linemen Diron Talbert,
Ron McDole and Richie Petitbon, earning the Redskins the nickname
``The Over the Hill Gang.''
   The nine games he won in his first season were the most
Washington had managed in 29 years.
   ``His basic philosophy was us against them,'' said Petitbon, who
played for Allen with the Chicago Bears, Rams and Redskins and
became his assistant in Washington. ``He made enemies of everyone -
the media, other teams - and it was effective. He was a great
motivator. The players loved him.''
   Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke said Allen ``was a Trojan for
work and for winning. He was one of the indestructibles.
   Though the Redskins kept winning, Allen was fired after the 1977
season. The late Edward Bennett Williams, who owned the team at
that time, said ``George was given an unlimited budget - and
exceeded it.''
   Allen landed back in Los Angeles, but the Rams fired him just
two games into the 1978 exhibition schedule.
   Allen also had two winning seasons in the now-defunct United
States Football League. He coached the Arizona Wranglers in 1984,
where he was 10-8, and the Chicago Blitz in 1983, leading them to a
12-6 mark.
   ``I talked to Coach Allen a few weeks ago and he was just so
excited about the winning season he had at Long Beach State,'' said
Houston Oilers coach Jack Pardee, who played under Allen as a
linebacker with the Washington Redskins.
   ``Coach Allen always thrived on building something out of very
little,'' Pardee said. ``And he was very excited about the
continuing challenge that he had at Long Beach.''
   ``George really did turn things around for the Rams and got us
on a winning track,'' said Hall of Fame defensive lineman Merlin
Olsen, who played under Allen. ``He always carried such great
enthusiasm with him and was one of the consummate motivators.''
   An advocate of physical fitness who competed in marathons,
bike-a-thons and triathlons, Allen founded the National Fitness
Foundation in 1952. A member of the President's Council on Physical
Fitness for several years, he was named chairman by President
Reagan in 1981.
   Allen wrote 11 books on football, one of which was the first
encyclopedia of football drills.
   Allen's friends in Washington included President Nixon. He once
used a play Nixon diagrammed for a playoff game against the San
Francisco 49ers. The reverse to wide receiver Roy Jefferson went
for a loss.

<HEAD>Sudan Put Under Islamic Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMED OSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military ruler Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir said Monday he was putting Islamic law into effect at
once in all parts of Sudan except the south, dominated by
Christians and animists.
   El-Bashir said the 1,400-year old Islamic Sharia law would cover
only administrative and civil cases, and that rules for criminal
cases would await application of a federal system here. He did not
specify when that would be.
   He said he was committing himself personally to drafting a
``decisive timetable and administrative measures necessary for
realization'' of Sharia law.
   El-Bashir said Sharia law would also cover banking and financial
dealings, abolishing interest payment. It was not immediately clear
how that would affect international transactions with this
north-central African nation and its population of about 25
million.
   El-Bashir spoke on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of
Sudan's independence from joint British-Egyptian rule.
   Then-President Gaafar Nimeiri introduced Islamic law in 1983,
but it was suspended after Nimeiri's overthrow in 1985. El-Bashir
deposed former Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi in June 1989.
   Nimeiri's introduction of the Sharia was a factor in Sudan's
being plunged into civil war. Renegade Col. John Garang and his
Sudan People's Liberation Army in 1983 took up arms in the south
against the Muslim-dominated government.
   Many sentences were passed and implemented under Sharia law,
including cutting off hands for theft, flogging and public disgrace
for adultery.
   Scrapping Sharia law has been a rebel condition for ending the
war.
   Monday's announcement was broadcast live on television, which
showed hundreds of people cheering el-Bashir around the
presidential palace in the capital, Khartoum, while shouting, ``We
will protect Islam with our blood!''
   Referring to southern Sudan, el-Bashir said the present legal
system will remain unchanged until the establishement of ``new
legislative bodies with power to decide the appropriate legal
system befitting the south.''
   He told a jubilant crowd, ``It became imperative and inevitable
that we should immediately apply the Sharia aw without delay or
procrastination in response to the will of Allah and the popular
demand.''

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, scrapping the pageantry of
past inaugurations for a simple ceremony befitting New York state's
economic hard times, took the oath of office Monday for a third
four-year term.
   Cuomo, widely viewed as one of the Democratic Party's most
eloquent orators, gave no inaugural address after he was sworn in
by New York Chief Judge Sol Wachtler.
   The afternoon ceremony at the Court of Appeals building in the
shadow of the state Capitol also featured the swearing in of Lt.
Gov. Stan Lundine. The inauguration was closed to the public.
   Cuomo hopes the $70,000 savings on inauguration festivities is
symbolic of his commitment to meet what he called the greatest
challenge faced by a New York governor since the Depression.
   ``That's what I have to get done. That's what I ran for,'' Cuomo
said of the fiscal problems during his re-election campaign.
``There's no way you could say, `No, that's not really important.
I'll solve the problem from Washington,' and then take off and
campaign from coast to coast. I couldn't do that and I wouldn't do
that.''
   Cuomo's chief Republican adversary in Albany agrees that the
person often mentioned as the front-runner for the Democratic
presidential nomination must take care of business at home first.
   ``Clearly what happens in the next year is going to be very
conclusive as to his chances as a candidate for national office,''
said state Senate Majority Leader Ralph Marino.
   For three straight years, the state has run a deficit. New
York's credit rating in March dropped from AA- to A, its lowest
ever. Only Massachusetts and Louisiana are considered worse
investments among states.
   During the last two years, Cuomo and the Legislature have raised
taxes by $2.8 billion - adding to Cuomo's reputation as a
big-spending Northeastern liberal.
   On Nov. 6, Cuomo won re-election with 53 percent of the vote,
down sharply from the 65 percent that gained him a second term in
1986.
   Even during the campaign, Cuomo warned that the state's
finances, despite hefty tax increases, were again turning red.
After the election, Cuomo said his relatively poor showing conveyed
the ``no new taxes'' message New Yorkers wanted to send him.
   Cuomo then unveiled a plan to eliminate what he estimated was a
$1 billion deficit in New York's $50 billion budget. To cheers from
the business community and Republican state Comptroller Edward
Regan, Cuomo turned away from new taxes. He proposed reducing state
aid to schools and firing 2,000 state workers.
   With a few changes, the Legislature approved Cuomo's plan Dec.
14. Three days later, Regan warned that this year's deficit could
balloon to $1.4 billion. And Regan said the state faced a potential
deficit next year of up to $4 billion.
   ``This will be much bigger than '83,'' Cuomo said Friday in
comparing the problem he'll face in the coming year to the
potential $1.8 billion deficit he faced when he first took office.
``On the numbers, this is the biggest problem the state has faced
since (Franklin) Roosevelt'' was governor of New York at the
beginning of the Depression.
   The fiscal balancing act represents a particular challenge to
Cuomo, who has tried to build a reputation as a champion of the
poor in his first eight years as governor.
   ``Clearly he's going to come in and make a lot of people
unhappy,'' Senate Majority Leader Marino said of the proposed state
budget Cuomo must unveil by the end of January.
   In addition, Cuomo is governor at a time when New York state is
losing clout in Washington. The 1990 Census results mean that New
York will lose three of its 34 House seats. Cuomo has said the new
population count could translate into billions of dollars in
reduced federal assistance.
   While Cuomo insists that he ``has no plans to run for president
and no plans to make plans,'' he does remain prominent on the
national stage. Two weeks ago, he began his work week with a speech
to the National Press Club in Washington and ended it with an
appearance on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''
   Lee Miringoff, head of the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion, noted that Cuomo spends a good deal of time attacking
President Bush and Congress.
   ``In New York, he's the insider, but outside New York, Cuomo is
the outsider,'' Miringoff said. ``It's interesting to watch what
lines he's using because were he to be running (for president), he
would likely be saying all those things.
   ``One must reach the conclusion that maybe, in fact, he is,''
the veteran Cuomo watcher added.

<HEAD>Rushdie Defends Cancellation of `Satanic' Paperback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Salman Rushdie on Monday struck back at the
writers who have criticized his decision to embrace Islam and halt
any immediate plans for a paperback version of his controversial
novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Over the weekend, writer Alan Sillitoe said Rushdie's decision
to cancel a the paperback edition was a ``blow to writers.''
Playwright Arnold Wesker was quoted by The Sunday Times as saying,
``It seems the religious terrorists have won.''
   ``The answer to that is, `thanks, Arnold,''' Rushdie said in an
interview on Independent Television News. ``Actually, it's none of
his business.''
   The interviewer noted that Wesker and other critics had
supported Rushdie.
   ``Yes, but presumably they were campaigning on my behalf because
they felt I had the right to write whatever I wanted, whatever I
thought,'' Rushdie said.
   ``If I only have free speech if I happen to agree with Arnold
Wesker's atheistic position, then that's really not much of a
position at all.''
   Rushdie, 43, has embarked on a cautious reentry to normal life
after two years in hiding under am Islamic death sentence. He was
condemned on Feb. 14, 1989 by Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   ``There's no doubt that the worst part of the past couple of
years has been that my son has been obliged to be without a father
for two years,'' Rushdie said. ``I'm sure most Muslims in this
country would understand that there is a innocent victim in this
and that it's time that he was allowed to have a father.''
   Rushdie noted that he had supported distribution of the
Pakistani film, ``International Guerrillas,'' which portrayed
Rushdie as a James Bond-like villain.
   ``Free speech is not to do with being an atheist or being a
believer,'' he said. Speaking about his religious beliefs, Rushdie
noted that he had recently been reading Fyodor Dostoevski, the
great Russian novelist.
   ``Dostoevski after all came very close to a firing squad and
spent a lot of time locked up. And during that time he wrote in
letters to friends that he had come to feel the need for faith like
parched earth does, and had found it, because as he wrote, `truth
shines in misfortune.'''
   Rushdie insisted he would not repudiate ``The Satanic Verses,''
which he has characterized as ``a moral fable,'' and would not
withdraw it from circulation.
   ``It seems to me what's very important is that the book should
remain in print so that in time it can be appreciated as something
other than the book it has been made out to be. I don't repudiate
the book. What I've said is, and what I've been explaining over and
over again for two years, is that it's been much misunderstood and
that I am trying now by canceling the paperback to create what I
call a pause for understanding.''
   Earlier in the day, Egypt's Religious Affairs Ministry denied
reports in The Observer weekly and in Cairo papers that Rushdie had
been officially invited to Egypt.
   Rushdie said Egypt's Islamic affairs minister had suggested it
might be appropriate for him to visit Egypt at some point, but said
he had no firm plans to go there.

<HEAD>No Celebrations Aboard Aircraft Carrier for New Year's Eve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS MIDWAY IN THE GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While fellow Americans
were celebrating New Year's Eve the traditional way, the 4,300 men
aboard the USS Midway celebrated with ice cream and popcorn at the
end of routine 12- to 14-hour workday.
   ``We're just watching and waiting,'' said 27-year-old Seaman
Apprentice Wendell Stephens from Philadelphia. ``I`m looking
forward to Jan. 1 because its payday.''
   Data Systems Technician Charles Greer, 22, from Casper, Wyo.,
was ``catching the next plane out'' to Bahrain where he would be
flying home to meet his family in San Francisco.
   The sailor who was being transferred to Naval Command Corps in
Vallejo, Calif., was surprisingly quiet while he discussed his
plans. ``I am leaving plenty of friends here,'' he said
   ``I don't think we'll have a party tonight,'' said Terry Toms,
40, commander of the Midway's F-18 Attack Squadron 115. ``It's our
job to be here - that's what we're doing tonight.''
   As a sign of the normal work routine, planes were taking off all
day from the deck of the Midway as squadron members were kept on
high alert status.
   E-2C Hawkeye surveillance planes, EA-6B Prowler electronic
attack aircraft, A-6E Intruder medium attack aircraft were also
involved in the practices.
   Even as Toms spoke, his men and planes were continuously
practicing takeoffs and landing on the deck as the carrier sailed
through the Persian Gulf. Aircraft carriers deployed in support of
Operation Desert Shield began sailing inside the narrow waterway
only about six weeks ago.
   Toms' squadron members were still mourning the loss of two of
their sailors who were killed last week when their tour bus
overturned on a liberty trip in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
   ``It's amazing that our first deaths were on shore,'' Toms said
wistfully.
   Added Rear Adm. Daniel P. March, ``Our job is to go to war if
President Bush calls us to do so.''
   March reiterated the U.S. Navy's commitment to the U.N.
resolution calling for a complete withdrawal from Kuwait by Jan. 15
or face possible attack.
   ``Our goal is clear: Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and the
restoration of its legitimate government,'' he said. ``We're going
to leave here when all this is over.''
   There were no decorations or New Year's cards hanging on the
walls and no special activities were planned by the ship's Office
of Welfare and Recreation.
   But the ship's crew, whose age averages 19, had not forgotten
their relatives and friends this holiday season.
   The ship's store had sold 10,000 seasons greetings cards by
Christmas, said Lt. Rich Huntoon, 39, the store's sales officer,
from Los Angeles.
   The Midway is the only carrier presently deployed in northern
Arabian Sea waters, with forays through the Strait of Hormuz and
into the Gulf. Two other U.S. carriers, the USS Theodore Roosevelt
and the USS America are on their way. The carriers will be under
March's command when they arrive.
   The Saratoga and the John F. Kennedy are in the Red Sea and the
Eastern Mediterranean.

<TEXT>
   Actor Kiel Martin, who played shady
detective Johnny ``J.D.'' LaRue on the former television series
``Hill Street Blues,'' has died at age 46.
   Martin, a cast regular on the Emmy-winning series, died Friday
of cardiovascular collapse due to lung cancer at his desert home in
Rancho Mirage, 100 miles southeast of Los Angeles, said Riverside
County Deputy Coroner Michael Werk.
   He was a regular on the daytime soap ``The Edge of Night''
before joining ``Hill Street Blues'' as a sleazy vice cop always in
some kind of trouble, usually involving money.
   The LaRue character routinely tried to snare his fellow officers
at the Hill Street station in get-rich-quick schemes that usually
went sour.
   ``He's a total opportunist and quite unrealistic toward
advancement and success,'' Martin once said of the character. ``But
he's a very good cop, which is something that not many people
mention,'' he added.
   Martin said he worked ``with a lot of cops'' on getting the
character right.
   In its seven seasons, ``Hill Street'' won more than 25 Emmys and
was considered a ground-breaking series that introduced a new level
of realism laced with dark humor to the police television drama
format.
   Born in Pittsburgh but raised in Miami, Martin freely admitted
that he was ``trouble as a kid.'' According to his studio
biography, his father urged a high school drama coach to allow him
to try out for a bit role in ``Finian's Rainbow.'' He got the lead
instead.
   Martin began his professional acting career in Florida repertory
theater. After moving to New York in the mid-1960s, he became a
stand-up comedian, dockworker and musician.
   Signed to a Universal Studios contract in 1967, his fledgling
career suffered a lengthy setback when he crashed his motorcycle
into a tree. Martin broke 15 bones in the accident and spent two
years recuperating.
   After the popular ``Hill Street'' series was canceled in 1987,
Martin played a dead man given a new shot at life in ``Second
Chance,'' a short-lived Fox television series.
   Also that year, he co-starred in the NBC-TV movie ``Convicted: A
Mother's Story'' with Ann Jillian, who plays a mother separated
from her two children when she is sent to prison.
   As her boyfriend, Martin coerces her to ``borrow'' $10,000 from
her employer with the promise that he only needs it for a few days
and will return it. But he skips town with the money.
   His film credits included ``The Panic in Needle Park'' in 1971
and ``The Lolly Madonna War'' in 1973. His other television credits
included ``Murder She Wrote,'' ``L.A. Law'' and ``The Blue
Knight.''
   Martin is survived by his mother, Eileen Mueller, and daughter
Jesse Martin. There will be no funeral service.

   The 12 European Community nations will
meet in emergency session this week and reports Monday said they
were ready to start a new diplomatic drive to avert war in the
Persian Gulf.
   An EC source said the foreign ministers will ``look at the role
of the (EC) in finding a political solution to the gulf crisis'' at
Friday's meeting in Luxembourg.
   Luxembourg assumes the EC presidency on Tuesday and the nation's
foreign minister, Jacques Poos, said he expected some EC states to
push for him to meet with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.
   Poos said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. he
expected contact would be made with Iraq either ``through
diplomatic channels or a private talk.''
   Poos said he would be ready to go to Baghdad if that was what
the EC decided. Asked if he thought he would be meeting Aziz in the
near future, he replied: ``Yes, I think so.''
   In Bonn, German officials suggested the EC foreign ministers
would discuss opening ``indirect talks'' with Iraq. They spoke on
condition of anonymity and did not elaborate.
   The EC ministers agreed on Dec. 18 not to meet with Aziz until
after Aziz met President Bush in Washington. The Aziz-Bush meeting
was scuttled in a dispute over a date, however.
   In London, former Prime Minister Edward Heath said a diplomatic
push was long overdue and accused the United States of failing to
pursue a diplomative initiative.
   ``Tens of thousands of lives depend on this and the whole of the
world order,'' he said on BBC radio.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said on the same program,
``I think there's a chance, not a good chance, there's a chance for
peace as long as the issues are clear ... that Saddam Hussein knows
that if he stays in Kuwait he will be attacked ... that if he
withdraws completely and unconditionally then he will not be
attacked.''
   Foreign ministers Hans-Dietrich Genscher of Germany and Gianni
De Michelis of Italy conferred with Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Budimir Loncar on Monday to examine chances of a new diplomatic
initiative.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met with Loncar on Sunday, but
rejected his appeal on behalf of the non-aligned movement to
withdraw from Kuwait, diplomats said.
   A senior Luxembourg official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said some EC member states ``talk about grand
initiatives, but we cannot do anything in contradiction with the
United States.''
   As president of the EC for six months, Luxembourg has
considerable sway over the agenda and content of EC ministerial
meetings and any European initiative aimed at resolving the gulf
crisis.
   Luxembourg Prime Minister Jacques Santer said Monday his country
would not take the initiative to formulate a new EC proposal. He
said Friday's meeting should reaffirm EC solidarity with the
international coalition opposing Iraq.
   Santer also expressed opposition to linking the gulf crisis and
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Iraq says the two questions
should be settled together.
   ``There should be no linkage,'' Santer said in a telephone
interview.
   However, Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens on Monday held
out hope of progress on the Palestinian and Lebanese issues once
Iraq had withdrawn from Kuwait.
   ``If Iraq conforms strictly to (U.N.) Security Council
resolutions, the United Nations could contribute to get
international talks on other issues under way,'' Eyskens said in a
statement.
   But Santer said the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline for Iraq to leave
Kuwait or face the prospect of war ``leaves very little room for
maneuver.''

   A hotel fire on Monday disrupted the New
Year's Eve vacation of about 300 tourists, many of them in town to
attend the Sugar Bowl college football game, fire officials said.
   Four people were treated at a local hospital for smoke
inhalation or cuts, authorities said. No one was seriously hurt.
   The fire broke out about 2 a.m. on the seventh floor of the
Avenue Plaza Hotel, about a mile from the French Quarter. Although
the blaze was confined to one room, the entire 12-story hotel was
evacuated.
   Investigators suspected the fire may have started on a gas
stove, said Deputy Fire Chief Ken Trepagnier. The guests who were
staying in the room where the blaze started apparently were out at
the time, he said.
   The hotel was full of Tennessee fans in town as part of a
special travel package. Tennessee plays Virginia in the Superdome
Tuesday night.
   `We couldn't even breathe,'' said Vivian Caldwell, of Nashville,
Tenn., a 1984 Tennessee graduate who was among those led to safety.
``The smoke was very, very heavy.''
   ``We crawled out down the hall,'' said Melissa Higgins, of
Greenville, Tenn., who had the room next door to where the fire
started. ``The smoke was so thick you couldn't see the exit
signs.''

   Eight people were killed and more
than 600 people were injured in New Year's revelry as Filipinos
generally disregarded pleas by authorities to avoid celebrating
with fireworks and weapons, hospitals and police said Tuesday.
   A check of 16 public and private hospitals in the capital showed
686 people were treated for burns, lacerations and bullet wounds
late Monday and early Tuesday.
   The dead included three children killed in a fire caused by
fireworks in Manila's Arlegui district near President Corazon
Aquino's residence.
   Officials said 13 fires were reported in the city on New Year's
Eve and all were caused by fireworks.
   ``The cause of fire on New Year's Eve is always firecracker
explosions,'' said fireman Eddie Macasadug. ``I think firecrackers
should be totally banned. I am surprised that some people want to
legalize firecrackers here.''
   Fireworks have been a staple of New Year's celebrations in the
country for years. The custom apparently came from Chinese
immigrants, who believed the crackle and pop of firecrackers would
scare off evil spirits.

   Transporation officials said Monday they had fired
a driver whose blood-alcohol level tested above the legal limit
after the trolley he was operating rammed into another rail car
last week, injuring 33 people.
   The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority also will start
testing its employees at random for alcohol and drugs in the wake
of the Friday morning accident, MBTA officials said.
   Two dispatchers who allegedly were slow to react to a
passenger's warning about the driver's behavior that morning have
been reassigned, they said.
   ``We dropped the ball,'' Thomas P. Glynn, the MBTA's general
manager, said at a news conference. ``We did not act in time to
avert this accident.''
   A test after the accident showed the driver, who authorities
have not identified, had a blood-alcohol level above the legal
limit of .10 percent. The man has not been arrested.
   ``It is clear that the operator's inability to function was the
critical element,'' Glynn said. ``There is no better argument for
random drug testing than what we've seen in the last few days.''
   The driver initially claimed the brakes had failed, but tests
showed there were no equipment problems, officials said.
   Although trolleys are supposed to slow to 6 mph as they approach
the subway platform, the train that crashed was traveling at least
20 mph, Glynn said. Its exact speed at the time of impact had not
been determined.
   Glynn ordered random drug testing of MBTA drivers, door guards
and police to begin in a month, despite longtime union opposition.
It would affect about 2,350 of the transit system's 5,000
employees.
   Officials with the Carmen's Union, which represents the
transportation workers, did not immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment.
   During the first half of this year, the MBTA fired 36 workers
for drug or alcohol abuse discovered either because of absenteeism
or because it was suspected by supervisors.
   The two dispatchers who received complaints about the driver
from passenger Tony Niederberger were reassigned to other jobs,
Glynn said.
   Niederberger, who got off the train half an hour earlier and
called the transit authority to report the driver, said his
warnings were handled too slowly to prevent the accident.
   ``We had to be going 70 (mph),'' said Niederberger, who attended
the news conference with MBTA officials. ``I honestly thought that
we were going to jump the tracks. The man did not seem to be
satisfied with how fast he was going.''
   The 64-year-old driver, a 20-year MBTA veteran, had no previous
incidents of alcohol or drug use on his record, officials said. He
also had no lengthy episodes of absenteeism, often a sign of
alcohol or drug abuse.

<HEAD>City Says Transit Authority Was Slow to Notify Emergency Agencies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transit employees were slow in notifying
emergency workers about a subway fire that killed two people and
injured 188 people last week, a preliminary city report on the
accident said Monday.
   Mayor David Dinkins said the preliminary investigation by his
office found that confusion about the exact location of the Friday
morning accident also slowed rescue efforts.
   ``The Transit Authority was slow to notify all of the city's
emergency response agencies and, even when it did, gave them
inaccurate information with which to respond,'' the report said.
   ``The lack of proper communication between the Transit Authority
and Transit Authority Police resulted in emergency agencies not
being fully aware of the exact location of the incident,'' it said.
   The report said that once emergency workers found the train and
victims, they performed well.
   Transportation Authority President Alan F. Kiepper said transit
workers ``gave the best information they had available at the
time'' to emergency workers.
   Kiepper said the authority would conduct its own inquiry and
report back in about 60 days.
   The fire, initially blamed on melting snow that fell down to
track level and caused an electrical short, sent thick smoke
through a tunnel that runs under downtown Brooklyn and then goes
under the East River toward Manhattan.
   Hundreds of commuters were trapped in stopped subway cars for
more than half an hour. Later, they complained of confusing
instructions from train crew and delays in getting attention from
rescue crews once they got off the train.
   One passenger died at the scene and a second died the following
day.
   ``Had the smoke condition been worse or had fire broken out in
the tunnel, even more lives may have been lost,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Mayor Defies Judge's Order in Landfill Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GARY, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A longstanding dispute over this community's
landfill was revived Monday when the mayor announced he would defy
a judge's order to contract with a court-approved company to
operate the dump.
   By defying the court order, Mayor Thomas V. Barnes risks a
possible 30-day jail term for himself and City Council President
Gardest Gillespie, as well as a $1.5 million fine against the city.
   ``I cannot sacrifice the interests of Gary citizens in order to
avoid jail, but we will not accept this order without a struggle,''
Barnes told a news conference.
   ``We intend to utilize every legal avenue available to set aside
the court's order, which represents an unconstitutional
infringement on our personal rights and on the rights of every
citizen of Gary.''
   Gary's municipal landfill has been criticized for decades as an
eyesore. State environmental officials sued the city in the late
1970s, claiming the landfill also was a source of air and
groundwater pollution.
   Lake Circuit Judge Lorenzo Arredondo in June ordered the
landfill closed and threatened to jail Barnes and Gillespie.
   Attorneys reached a negotiated agreement whereby Mid American
Wastes Management Systems Inc. of Canal Winchester, Ohio, would
assume operation of the landfill, reserve 11.5 percent of its gross
receipts for the city and begin cleaning it up.
   But in July, Arredondo rejected the agreement.
   On Dec. 21, he ordered the city to contract with Indiana Waste
Systems, a subsidiary of Waste Management Inc. of Oak Brook, Ill.
   Barnes accused the judge of conspiring with Waste Management. He
said the city would seek to have Arredondo's decision stayed by the
Indiana Court of Appeals and to have the judge removed from the
case.
   ``If we don't get satisfaction from the state courts, we'll go
to federal court,'' Barnes said.

<HEAD>Jackson Warns Bush Against Going to War Without Congressional
Consent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush should face impeachment if he
leads the nation to war against Iraq without congressional consent,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Monday.
   ``There is a way out, and so we must make a further appeal,''
Jackson said. ``If Mr. Bush unilaterally disregards the role of
Congress in this deliberative process, he must face the challenge
of impeachment.
   ``There's not a war wherein there is a state of emergency and we
must move unilaterally and quickly because bombs are heading our
way,'' he said. ``We've had the time to deliberate this process.''
   Only two weeks remain before the United Nations deadline for
Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or face potential military action by
the U.S.-led multinational force deployed in the Persian Gulf.
   ``The focus should be on the goal of getting Iraq out of Kuwait,
not on a cutoff date,'' Jackson said. ``January 15 is the birthday
of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the apostle of nonviolence, and hope
and peace. It shouldn't be the date we start a war.''
   Jackson, whose son Yusef plays for the University of Virginia
football team against Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's
night, celebrated his 28th wedding anniversary on Monday with his
wife, Jackie, and all of their children.

   The U.S.-led 28-nation force in the
Persian Gulf, the biggest such force assembled since the Korean
War, is expected to have a strength of more than 550,000 personnel
by the end of January.
   Saddam Hussein has an estimated 510,000 troops in occupied
Kuwait and southern Iraq and has mobilized tens of thousands more
men.
   Here's a breakdown of the forces confronting each other in the
gulf:
   UNITED STATES: There are about 300,000 military personnel now in
the region in Operation Desert Shield. In the next few weeks, that
will reach 430,000. At the peak of the Vietnam War in 1968, 545,000
Americans were involved.
   Ground forces deployed in the first wave include the 82nd ``All
American'' Airborne Division, the 101st ``Screaming Eagles''
Airborne Division, the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division, the 11th
Air Defense Artillery Brigade, 197th Mechanized Infantry Brigade,
the 1st Cavalry Division and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.
   The second-wave deployment includes three armored divisions, the
2nd and 3rd from Germany and the 1st from Fort Riley, Kan., that
will bolster American offensive capability on the ground for a
possible thrust against Kuwait if it is still occupied by Iraq
after the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline for withdrawal.
   The U.S. force will have about 2,000 tanks when deployment is
completed.
   Three carrier battle groups built around the USS America, the
USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Ranger, and the battleship USS
Missouri, 300 more combat jets and 45,000 marines from the 5th
Marine Expeditionary Brigade and the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force
will also be deployed in the second phase.
   Current marine capability is provided by 45,000 men of the 1st,
4th and 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigades who make up the 1st MEF.
When deployment is complete, about three-quarters of the U.S.
Marine Corps will be committed to Desert Shield.
   There is a Special Forces contingent from the 1st Special
Operations Command.
   The U.S. fleet already in the gulf, the Arabian Sea and the
eastern Mediterranean totals around 55 ships. They include the
aircraft carriers Saratoga, John F. Kennedy and Midway, the
battleship Wiscnsin with 32 Tomahawk cruise missiles, five missile
cruisers, four destroyers, several frigates, plus supply ships and
an estimated 6-8 nuclear submarines.
   The aircraft carriers now in place have a combined strike force
of 180 A-6 Intruder, F/A-18 Hornet fighters and F-14 Tomcats. The
Marines have some 60 AV-8B Harrier jump-jets. Those numbers will be
doubled when the second-phase formations arrive.
   Among the 800 Air Force combat aircraft deployed so far are 22
F117A Stealth fighter-bombers and as many as 38 long-range F-111F
bombers.
   There are an estimated 150 F-16s and F-15s, more than 70 A-10
tank-killing Thunderbolts and unspecified numbers of F-4 Wild
Weasel air-defense suppression jets and other combat aircraft
deployed at 30 airbases in the region. Three squadrons are based in
southern Turkey.
   A squadron of an estimated 26 B-52G strategic bombers is on the
Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia.
   BRITAIN: With 18,200 personnel in the region, and 16,000 more to
be deployed by mid-January, Britain will have the second largest
Western contingent in the region after the United States with
35,000 men, at least 50 combat jets and a naval armada.
   It is Britain's biggest military deployment abroad since the
Korean War.
   The three-ship Armilla Patrol permanently in the gulf was beefed
up to 16 ships, including three missile destroyers, five missile
frigates, three minesweepers with support ships.
   Four squadrons of Tornado and Jaguar interceptors and ground
attack jets are in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Three Nimrod maritime
reconnaisance aircraft are in Oman. More Jaguars are expected.
   The 7th Armored Brigade, successors to the famous ``Desert
Rats'' of World War II, with 120 Challenger tanks and 9,500 troops
is attached to the U.S. Marine force in northeastern Saudi Arabia
in Britain's biggest military operation since the 1982 Falklands
war against Argentina.
   It is being joined by the ``infantry heavy'' 4th Brigade from
Germany, with 43 Challengers, scores of armored fighting vehicles,
artillery, multiple rocket launchers, 36 attack and scout
helicopter and major engineering units whose task will be to breach
Iraqi defenses in Kuwait. The two brigades will form the 30,000-man
1st Armored Division.
   FRANCE: By mid-January it will have 10,000 men in the region,
including army formations making up the 6th Light Armored Division.
It is the biggest French military deployment overseas since the
1954-62 Algerian War.
   It has 12-14 warships with some 1,200 men deployed. The warships
include a guided-missile cruiser, two missile destroyers, four
frigates and a corvette with support vessels.
   France has sent three squadrons of interceptors and
fighter-bombers and another squadron has been commited.
   Its 4,000-man Rapid Action Force is deployed with Arab forces in
the northeastern Saudi desert. It includes the 5th Combat
Helicopter Regiment with 42 gunships, the Foreign Legion's 3nd
Infantry Regiment with anti-tank missiles, the 1st Spahis Cavalry
Regiment with armored vehicles and an anti-aircraft missile unit.
France may soon send an additional 1,000-man artillery unit with 24
155mm guns.
   A second-wave deployment now under way includes a marine
artillery regiment, another combat helicopter regiment with 24 Puma
gunships and a dragoons regiment with 40 AMX-30 battle tanks.
   A company of 190 paratroopers equipped for chemical warfare is
in the United Arab Emirates. There are 7,300 paratroopers stationed
in Djibouti across the Red Sea from Saudi Arabia with a squadron of
Mirage fighters.
   ITALY: The frigates Libeccio, Orsa and Zeffiro and a support
ship, the Stromboli, are in the gulf. The corvettes Minerva and
Sting are in the eastern Mediterranean replacing U.S. units
assigned to the gulf.
   A squadron of eight Tornado fighters is based near Abu Dhabi,
U.A.E., to provide air cover for Italian warships. Six Starfighter
jets are to be deployed. No ground force deployment is planned.
   CANADA: The destroyers Athabaskan and Terra Nova and the supply
ship Protecteur are heading for the gulf. A squadron of 18 CF-18
fighter jets from Germany is in Saudi Arabia.
   NETHERLANDS: The frigates Witte de With and Pieter Florisz are
in the Gulf of Oman with the combat supply ship Zuiderkruis.
   SPAIN: The frigates Nuamancia, Infanta Cristina and Diana are
patrolling the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, southern gateway to the Red
Sea.
   AUSTRALIA: The guided-missile frigates Adelaide and Darwin and
the supply ship Success are in the Red Sea.
   BELGIUM: The minehunters Iris and Myosotis with the supply ship
Zinnia are in the Gulf of Oman. The Belgians have also commited
four C-130 military transport planes.
   ARGENTINA: The destroyer Almirante Brown and the frigate Spiro
are in the Red Sea. A 100-man army unit will also be sent.
   SOVIET UNION: The Udaloy-class destroyer Admiral Tributs and an
anti-submarine ship are in the Gulf of Oman. Moscow has indicated
it would send ground forces, but only under U.N. command.
   GREECE: The frigate Elli is in the Red Sea. Greece is supplying
merchant ships for the U.S. sealift.
   GERMANY: It is providing merchant ships to the sealift,
ammunition for the British forces and $2 billion toward the
multinational force. Germany's constitution prohibits it commiting
military forces.
   DENMARK: The corvette Olfert Fischer is in the gulf. Danish
merchant ships are helping in the U.S. sealift.
   NORWAY: The Coast Guard cutter Andenes is in the gulf supporting
the Danish corvette. Norway has offered anti-chemical warfare
equipment.
   PORTUGAL: The naval support Sao Miguel is carrying equipment and
supplies to the British force. Portugal has also allowed U.S.
aircraft to refuel at its airbases.
   POLAND: It will send a military field hospital and a hospital
ship to the gulf.
   CZECHOSLOVAKIA: It has sent a 200-man army unit with
anti-chemical warfare equipment, the first Warsaw Pact country to
send forces to the gulf.
   HONDURAS: It is sending 150 troops to Saudi Arabia and possibly
350 more, in the country's first foreign military deployment.
   BULGARIA: It will send a small detachment of military medical
personnel.
   NEW ZEALAND: It is sending two C-130 transports and an army
medical team.
   THE PHILIPPINES: It will send a small volunteer detachment of
military medical personnel.
   
   Allied Arab Forces:
   
   GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, United
Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait): A rapid deployment force of up to
10,000 troops is based at Hafr al-Batin, northeast Saudi Arabia, 40
miles south of the Kuwait border. They and allied Arab-Islamic
forces form the first line of defense, with the Americans and
others south of them.
   The GCC force has been beefed up with 7,000 soldiers of Kuwait's
20,000-man army who escaped their country when Iraq invaded. Most
of their heavy weapons were captured by Iraq, but some combat jets,
naval attack craft and tanks were saved.
   The GCC and other gulf Arab forces total about 150,500 men, 330
combat aircraft, 800 tanks and 36 major naval units, although not
all are likely to be involved in Desert Shield.
   They are supported by:
   
   EGYPT: About 20,000 troops, including paratroopers, commandos,
chemical warfare specialists and infantry, are in Saudi Arabia with
400 tanks. The force includes the 3rd and 4th Armored Divisions and
the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division. Another 7,000 men are being
sent. About 2,250 troops are in the U.A.E.
   SYRIA: About 19,000 troops, including elite Special Forces units
who fought the Israelis and others in Lebanon, are in Saudi Arabia.
Most of the 15,000-man 9th Armored Division with 270 T-62 tanks,
have arrived. Another 2,000 troops are in the U.A.E.
   PAKISTAN: About 5,000 troops are in Saudi Arabia and 2,000 in
the U.A.E. with 1,000 advisers. An estimated 5,000 advisers are
already attached to the Saudi armed forces. An additional armored
division may be commited.
   MOROCCO: It has 1,200 troops in Saudi Arabia and 500 in the
U.A.E.
   BANGLADESH: It has 2,000 troops, including engineering and
infantry units, in Saudi Arabia.
   SENEGAL: About 500 troops are in Saudi Arabia.
   NIGER: It has sent 480 troops to guard the holy shrines of Mecca

   IRAQ:
   The army has seven corps totaling 55-60 divisions. There are
555,000 regular troops and 480,000 reserves all of whom are
believed to have been mobilized. Regular forces include six
divisions of elite Republican Guards.
   Iraq claims a militia called the Popular Army has 8 million men,
but its true strength is estimated at around 850,000.
   Saddam Hussein has 5,500 tanks, including some 500 high-quality
T-72s and 1,000 medium-quality T-62s; 3,500 artillery guns; 200
multiple rocket launchers; an estimated 500 surface-to-surface
missiles; more than 330 surface-to-air missile launchers, including
captured Kuwaiti systems; some 700 combat aircraft, including
Soviet-supplied long-range Su-24 fighter-bombers and advanced
MiG-29 interceptors, spread around an estimated 25 heavily
protected airbases.
   Its main naval units are a training frigate with anti-submarine
torpedoes, an estimated eight Soviet-built missile-attack craft and
six torpedo boats plus several captured Kuwaiti missile craft.
   In Kuwait, Iraq has an estimated 13 divisions, four of them
armored, totalling 280,000 troops, 2,200 T-55 and T-62 tanks and a
buildup continues.
   A further 15-18 divisions, including the Republican Guard
divisions with up to 1,800 tanks and 800 guns, are dug-in in
southern Iraq as a strategic reserve. This also includes elements
of the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 7th Army Corps. All told this force has
some 230,000 men with 750 guns. Also deployed in the Kuwait theater
are 2,500 armored personnel carriers and 2,700 guns.
   Saddam is deploying some 250,000 more men - seven new divisions
and 150,000 reservists - in Kuwait.
   Silkworm anti-ship missiles are believed to have been deployed
to counter any U.S. amphibious landing in Kuwait. FROG-7
battlefield missiles have also been deployed, including batteries
captured in Kuwait, behind formidable defense lines.

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis Drew Most Public Interest in 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The public's attention was riveted to the
Persian Gulf crisis more closely than to any other news story in
1990 - a year in which international events overshadowed domestic
news.
   The Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press found that
two-thirds of the public closely followed stories about the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait and the deployment of American forces to the
region.
   By comparison, the historic fall of communism in almost all of
Eastern Europe and the economic and political turmoil in the Soviet
Union failed to interest most Americans. At no point did more than
30 percent of Americans closely follow these events, according to
the center's monthly surveys.
   The most closely followed domestic news story also had a link to
the Mideast crisis. Sixty-two percent of those surveyed said they
regularly read stories about soaring gasoline prices in August and
September.
   By comparison, reports in November about the declining economy
attracted only 39 percent of the readers on a regular basis.
Stories leading up to and including the November general election
caught the regular attention of only 38 percent, as did stories
last January about the war against drugs.
   Only one other news event, involving U.S. soldiers fighting
abroad, caught the close attention of more than a majority of
Americans: Sixty percent of Americans regularly read stories about
the U.S. invasion of Panama. Although U.S. forces invaded Panama on
Dec. 20, 1989, their presence in the country and numerous news
stories continued into this year.
   The center's figures are based on monthly telephone surveys of
1,200 adults nationwide.
   Public interest in some issues shifted significantly during the
year.
   Last spring, only 18 percent of the public paid close attention
to stories about the first signs of economic problems. The
percentage had increased to 29 percent by September and it was 39
percent in November.
   There was only scant attention to the nation's budget deficit
last spring when Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., proposed a deficit
reduction plan. During the summer as Congress debated a budget
package, 18 percent of the readers were following the issue
closely, but public attention increased to 34 percent by the fall
amid threats to shut down the federal government.
   Interest in news concerning President Bush also fluctuated.
   When Bush attended the drug summit in Columbia last February,
only 22 percent of the public paid close attention to stories about
the visit. Criticism of the president on his changing position on
taxes and his Persian Gulf policy caught the close attention of
slightly less than a third of the public.
   By contrast, three out of four people read last March about
Bush's distaste for broccoli.
   Sensational crimes and trials drew substantial public interest.
   News about the serial killings in Gainesville, Fla., attracted
more public attention - 36 percent - than any other crime story
during the year. Twenty-eight percent of the readers followed the
drug arrest of Mayor Marion Barry of Washington, D.C., but interest
waned. Only 16 percent paid close attention to stories about
Barry's conviction on some of the charges.
   Some stories attracted less public interest than expected.
   Despite the extensive coverage of the nomination of David Souter
to the U.S. Supreme Court, only about 15 percent followed the event
closely.
   And more than half of the people surveyed said they strongly
felt too much was written about the marital breakup of Donald and
Ivana Trump. Twelve percent of the public said they closely
followed the affair.

<HEAD>Editors Vote Gulf Crisis Top Story of 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the heart-stopping
standoff that ensued in the Persian Gulf was by far the top news
story of 1990, according to an AP poll of newpaper editors and
broadcast news directors.
   In the balloting by 327 news people, the Gulf crisis finished
well ahead of the story that placed second, the reunification of
Germany.
   Here are the top 10 stories with vote totals, based on 10 points
for an editor's No. 1 choice down to one for the No. 10 pick:
   1. Iraq invades Kuwait, making hostages of thousands of
foreigners and setting off worldwide military response. 2,506.
   2. East and West Germany reunite after more than four decades as
separate countries. 1,460.
   3. Political and economic reforms throw Soviet Union into
turmoil; moves toward sovereignty are afoot in all 15 republics.
1,287.
   4. The savings-and-loan bailout grows ever larger, touching one

<HEAD>Indiana Paper Freezing Wages for 90 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Evansville Courier is freezing the
wages of its 450 employees for 90 days in an attempt to avoid
layoffs at the end of 1991's first quarter.
   Tom Tuley, president of the paper, said slumping ad revenues and
rising expenses were squeezing profits.
   ``What I'm trying to do is avoid layoffs at this point,'' Tuley
was quoted as saying in a story published in the newspaper Dec. 28.
   Effective Jan. 1, the annual raise reviews of Courier employees
will be pushed back 90 days, the newspaper said. An employee
eligible for a raise in January will instead be reviewed in April.
Those eligible in May could get raises in August.
   The company has been under a partial hiring freeze since last
April, Tuley said. It also is considering cutting the percentage of
the newspaper devoted to news and increasing the percentage of
advertising, as well as possibly cutting costs in its production
department, he said.
   ``Right now, I don't anticipate we're going to have to lay off
people, but I certainly couldn't guarantee that,'' he said.
   The Courier was purchased in 1986 by E.W. Scripps Co., which
reported a 17.2 percent drop in publishing profits for the first
nine months of this year.

   The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star will
become an all-day newspaper next September, published and delivered
in both morning and afternoon under the single name of The
Virginian-Pilot.
   Associate Publisher Frank Batten Jr. said there will be no
significant savings to the company. The change will not affect the
number of people the company employs, he said.
   ``At present, the same reporters write for both newspapers, and
many of the stories appear in both newspapers. Having one name on
the masthead recognizes that The Virginian-Pilot and The
Ledger-Star are almost the same newspaper today,'' Batten said.
   Subscribers to The Ledger-Star will receive the afternoon
editions of The Virginian-Pilot.
   The all-day newspaper will have fresh news for each edition,
Batten said. The afternoon edition will go to press at midday, the
current presstime of The Ledger-Star. Advertisements can begin
either in the morning or in the evening, as is the case now.
   The morning paper has a weekday circulation of 157,292 and the
afternoon paper 72,066. On Saturday and Sunday the newspapers
publish a combined edition with 239,457 circulation on Saturday and
239,189 on Sunday.

<HEAD>Landmark VDT Ordinance Signed Into Law in San Francisco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new city law aimed at protecting workers
who use video display terminals is likely to be amended to give
businesses more time to comply.
   The law, which affects city workers and private businesses with
15 or more employees, requires adjustable workstations, regular
breaks and training on safe use of VDTs. It also recommends
transfer to non-VDT work for pregnant women who ask to be moved.
   ``This legislation ... will ensure San Francisco workers are
protected from dangerous injury, without driving away businesses,''
Mayor Art Agnos said as he signed the ordinance Dec. 27. ``It's
legislation on the cutting edge of social change.''
   The ordinance requires compliance within two years for most
businesses, but Agnos worked out a compromise with business and
labor leaders calling for a longer period. The amendments proposed
under the compromise are to be voted on next month by the Board of
Supervisors.
   The proposed changes are a three-step program for compliance:
   - After one year, new equipment would have to meet standards in
the ordinance.
   - For existing workstations, retrofitting that cost less than
$250 would have to be completed within 30 months.
   - Retrofitting that cost more than $250 would have to be
completed within four years.
   The legislation was pushed by a coalition of activists who cited
dangers to VDT operators, including repetitive strain injury, back
and neck pain, deteriorating vision and possible miscarriages.
   The law will affect an estimated 56,000 workers and will cost
about $14 million in the private sector within the first 30 months,
said Paul Varacalli, executive director of Service Employees
International Union Local 590, which backed the bill.
   It will cost an estimated $231,552 to bring the city into
compliance, he said.

<HEAD>Briefs Filed in College Crime Reports Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The editor of a student newspaper said
she hopes a federal judge will rule on her lawsuit to open campus
crime reports in time to publish the information in the paper's
next issue on Jan. 18.
   Lawyers for both sides filed briefs with U.S. District Judge
Russell G. Clark on Dec. 21.
   Arguments were filed after lawyers Douglas W. Greene, who
represents Traci Bauer and The Southwest Standard of Southwest
Missouri State University, and John F. Black, who represents the
school, were unable to reach a settlement.
   The issue centers on whether Ms. Bauer can have access to
university crime reports and whether releasing those reports will
threaten the school's ability to receive federal funds.
   In his brief, Greene contends the university's resistance to Ms.
Bauer's effort to get crime reports is indicative of the school's
refusal to acknowledge crimes occur on campus. He said the
university has refused the Springfield Police Department's offer to
station two officers on campus.
   Greene also argues that administrators are more concerned about
image than informing students and the public of crimes on campus.
   He asked the judge to rule that the university is a public body
and comes under state open meeting and records laws.
   Black countered in his brief that a ruling for the newspaper
would open the prospect of requiring every university department to
make all documents and proceedings available to the public. Past
court cases have ruled that while the Board of Regents is a public
body governed by the state's open records law, a university is not
subject to that law, he wrote.
   Trying to comply with the federal Family Education and Privacy
Rights Act while satisfying Ms. Bauer's demand for access to crime
reports would not work because the university would have to notify
students an exception had been made to the federal act, Black said.
   Ms. Bauer has been given oral reports of crimes by campus
security officers, Black said. To go beyond that would violate the
privacy of others, he said.

<HEAD>Court Throws Out Case Against Omni Magazine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's highest court threw out a $30
million lawsuit filed against Omni magazine by a couple angered
that their family photo illustrated an article about coffee's
effect on fertility.
   The state Court of Appeals said in a unanimous decision Dec. 27
that it was reluctant to second-guess an editorial decision.
Trial-level and appellate courts also had rejected the family's
lawsuit.
   Joseph and Ida Finger of Saugerties, N.Y., and their six
children were pictured beside an article titled ``Caffeine and Fast
Sperm'' in Omni's June 1988 issue. The article discussed medical
research that indicated in vitro fertilization rates may be
enhanced by exposing sperm to high concentrations of caffeine.
   ``Want a big family?'' the photograph's caption read. ``Maybe
your sperm needs a cup of java in the morning. Tests reveal that
caffeine-spritzed sperm swim faster, which may increase the chances
for in vitro fertilization.''
   The couple, who conceived their children naturally, had been
photographed for an article in a Roman Catholic publication, said
their lawyer, Paul Gruner. They weren't aware a photo service had
given their picture to Omni until a friend showed Mrs. Finger the
magazine, he said.
   ``When it became known in a small community, the children were
the subject of some ridicule,'' Gruner said.
   The couple argued that their civil rights were violated because
the picture was used without permission. State law prohibits the
use of a photograph without consent for purposes of advertising or
trade.
   Court of Appeals Judge Fritz Alexander noted the courts have
consistently refused to apply the civil rights law to news
articles, limiting those interpretations to advertising.
   ``Questions of `newsworthiness' are better left to reasonable
editorial judgment and discretion,'' Alexander wrote.
   He said the Fingers had a misperception about the theme of the
article, which the judge said was more about increased fertility
than in vitro or ``test tube'' fertilization.
   The judge said there's clearly a ``real relationship'' between
the fertility theme and a picture of six healthy, attractive
children who all bear a striking resemblance to their parents.
   Laura Handman, lawyer for Omni, said the article made it very
clear the medical findings are only in the laboratory stages.
   ``You have to assume a certain degree of common sense by the
reader,'' Handman said. ``I don't think there's been any family
created by six cases of in vitro fertilization - coffee or no
coffee.''
   Gruner said the decision would give the press too much freedom
to use pictures of people with articles that have nothing to do
with them.

<HEAD>Convicted Judge Plans To Sue Dow Jones</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph F. O'Kicki, the former president judge
of Cambria County who was convicted of corruption, has filed notice
that he intends to sue the parent company of The Wall Street
Journal.
   O'Kicki originally filed the notice Nov. 2 in Cambria County
Common Pleas Court. A lawyer representing Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. had
the case moved to U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh last week.
   W. Thomas McGough Jr., local counsel for Dow Jones, said no
actual complaint had been filed by O'Kicki, only a writ of summons
that serves as a notice.
   O'Kicki did not specify in the writ the substance of the
complaint. The former judge drafted the one-paragraph writ himself
and named as defendants Dow Jones, Journal reporter Milo Geyelin
and Dow Jones Chief Executive Officer Warren H. Phillips.
   McGough speculated in court papers that the complaint would
focus on a series of articles the newspaper published about the
judge in November and December 1989, while O'Kicki's trial was in
progress, and after his conviction. McGough wrote that the
complaint seems to be ``based in some manner upon these articles
and upon a theory of defamation.''
   The former judge was convicted Dec. 16, 1989, of official
oppression, bribery and criminal coercion.
   The jury decided O'Kicki made court employees chop his wood and
feed his dogs, solicited $500 from a court officer for a promotion
he never granted, sought payment from an attorney after the judge
awarded damages to the lawyer's client and demanded that a bank
favorably settle his personal loan.

<HEAD>Reporter Testifies in Court Fight Over FBI Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reporter who received copies of
confidential FBI documents during the trial of nine organized crime
figures said Dec. 27 that he knew who sent him the material and
promised the source anonymity.
   The U.S. attorney's office wants to recover the documents from
two newspapers and three television stations so investigators can
trace the leak.
   Initially, six news outlets that received the documents were
subpoenaed to give them to a federal grand jury. The Tribune-Review
of Greensburg relinquished the documents.
   Lawyers for The Pittsburgh Press, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
and television stations KDKA and WPXI filed motions seeking to
quash the subpoenas. WTAE-TV also received the documents but did
not join in the motions.
   During a hearing, Post-Gazette reporter Mike Bucsko said he
received the documents in the mail several weeks before other news
organizations did. Bucsko said he knew the source and had promised
not to reveal the identity.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Linda L. Kelly didn't ask Bucsko to name
the source in court.
   Attorneys for the news organizations argued that relinquishing
the documents could ultimately identify the source, whether
reporters know the source or not.
   U.S. District Judge Donald J. Lee took the matter under
advisement.
   The government claims the documents, known as FBI 302 reports,
have value as evidence. Prosecutors have said whoever mailed the
documents could be prosecuted for obstruction of justice or
contempt of court.
   The reports were capsules of debriefings of federal witness
Marvin Droznek. The reports were among many shared by the
government with defense lawyers in the trial of nine organized
crime figures, who were convicted Oct. 29 after an eight-week
trial.

<TEXT>
   A newspaper reporter has been subpoenaed to
testify about a jail-house interview conducted with a woman accused
of shooting her husband to death.
   The Dayton Daily News requested Dec. 28 that the subpoena be
thrown out, citing the ``critical need to protect the
news-gathering process from compelled disclosure.''
   The subpoena was issued by Montgomery County Common Pleas Judge
William MacMillan Jr.
   County Prosecutor Lee C. Falke also wants reporter Dwayne Bray
to reveal the contents of notes he took during an interview with
Joyce Anaga.
   In a story published Dec. 21, Mrs. Anaga was quoted as saying
that her husband had abused her and that she shot him while they
were struggling over a shotgun. She said she planned to plead
self-defense under a new Ohio law for battered women. Her trial is
scheduled for this week.
   Prosecutors said they want to see all of Mrs. Anaga's comments
to Bray.
   ``If she takes the stand and gives a different story, then it
would be very important to know if she said something different
...,'' Falke said.
   Falke said there are precedents in Ohio courts that allow him to
subpoena a reporter to answer questions about an interview.
   The Ohio Supreme Court ruled in June that a subpoena may be
enforced ``over a reporter's claim of privilege, so long as it is
persuaded that the subpoena has been requested or issued for a
legitimate purpose, rather than for harassment.''

<HEAD>Bolles Case Figure Loses Legal Round</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man charged with murdering investigative
reporter Don Bolles in 1976 lost a bid to reinstate a $300 million
civil suit claiming Phoenix police destroyed records that could
help prove his innocence.
   In a 3-0 ruling Dec. 27, the state Court of Appeals said the
lawsuit was filed by Max Dunlap too long after the fact to qualify
under the statute of limitations.
   Dunlap was convicted in 1977 of killing Bolles, a reporter for
The Arizona Republic. Dunlap's conviction was overturned on appeal
in 1980, but he was charged again on Dec. 19. He is accused of
ordering the slaying at the behest of unidentified higher-ups.
   He filed his civil lawsuit on July 2, 1982, claiming his
constitutional rights were violated when police shredded documents
in the case.
   A Superior Court judge threw out the suit in 1988, saying its
filing two years and a month after the dismissal of the first
criminal charge was a month too late.
   Dunlap argued on appeal that he had three years in which to file
because the statute of limitations for fraud cases is three years
and the suit claims police officers engaged in fraud.
   But Appeals Judge William Eubank said that the suit really
centered on the claim Dunlap's constitutional rights were violated
and that such claims must be brought to court within two years.
   Dunlap's lawyer, Murray Miller, said he had to study the
decision before deciding whether to appeal the state Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Prof Plans Service To Give Voters Facts on Candidates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Kimball envisions a future in which
voters reject television campaign commercials and select national
leaders as they would prospective employees - by reviewing their
resumes.
   He has taken a leave from his job to try to make those resumes
and more available to voters by telephone in 1992 on every
candidate running for national office from every state.
   ``The people in Congress are the hired help,'' said Kimball.
``We're saying if you, the voter, are the employer, what do you
need to know?''
   Kimball, a political science teacher and former Arizona state
senator, is directing the Center for National Independence in
Politics, a non-profit organization whose honorary co-chairmen are
former Presidents Ford and Carter.
   Kimball says that by 1992, the center will offer a telephone
number providing voters:
   - Basic personal information on each candidate.
   - Names of people and organizations who have contributed to the
campaign.
   - Ratings of the candidate by special interest groups ranging
from the American Conservative Union to the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   The center experimented with its concept in this year's
elections in Nebraska and North Carolina.
   ``We got about 6,000 calls,'' said Kimball. Since the center did
no paid advertising, the calls were generated by news stories and
word of mouth after one press conference.
   When people called the 800-number, they got an operator with
access to a computer holding the information on each candidate.
   Kimball said about 50 percent of the callers wanted voting
record ratings and 25 percent sought campaign finance information,
but operators also got calls seeking a range of biographical
details.
   Kimball says the center needs at least $500,000 to run a
nationwide telephone service using toll-free numbers, but he said a
self-financing 900-number system would be used if sufficient funds
aren't raised. It would cost $3 a call.

<HEAD>Americans Spend Sixth Christmas in Captivity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans Terry Anderson and Thomas
Sutherland spent their sixth Christmas in captivity and newspapers
printed greetings from Anderson's family and a photo of the
daughter he has never held.
   ``Perhaps our miracle will happen and we'll welcome you home in
time to share the beginning of the new year,'' wrote Peggy Say,
Anderson's sister.
   For Anderson, the longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon, it
was another grim milestone in his ordeal. The 43-year-old chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press was kidnapped on
March 16, 1985.
   Sutherland, 59, of Fort Collins, Colo., is the
second-longest-held American among the 13 missing Westerners. He
was dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut when
he was kidnapped on June 9, 1985.
   The other captives are four Americans, four Britons, two Germans
and an Italian.
   Beirut's eight major newspapers carried messages on Dec. 25 for
Anderson from Mrs. Say, his 5-year-old daughter, Sulome - born four
months after he was kidnapped - and Sulome's mother, Madeleine.
   The leftist as-Safir daily also published greetings to British
hostage John McCarthy from his family and friends on his fifth
Christmas as a captive.
   McCarthy, 34, a London-based television journalist, was
kidnapped on April 17, 1986, as he drove to Beirut Airport to catch
a flight for London.
   The message to McCarthy, in a paid advertisement, urged him to
``stay as cheerful as you can and be assured we all miss you and
love you.''
   Beirut's independent an-Nahar ran the English text of the
letters sent to Anderson with full Arabic translations.
   The French-language L'Orient-Le Jour carried the text of the two
messages from Mrs. Say and Sulome's mother in English and French
along with the latest photograph of his youngest daughter.
   Both newspapers said they hoped the kidnappers would let
Anderson read the letters and see the picture of his daughter.
   ``We are united with you in spirit always. But Christmas and the
holidays make it especially difficult to accept the fact of not
being with you in body,'' Sulome's mother wrote. ``We are so near
you and yet so far. But our hopes are always high for a bright
futre and reunion forever. Merry Christmas to all of you.''
   Mrs. Say told Anderson that his elder daughter, Gabrielle, was
``a blossoming young woman. ... She's a big girl now and captain of
her soccer team. She's attending the school you wanted for her and
is doing excellently.''
   Mrs. Say expressed her hope that this would be her brother's
last Christmas in captivity.
   ``Your friends have remained committed to your cause and we are
all working hard for your release,'' she wrote.
   ``Especially at Christmas, I received letters from all over the
United States telling me of the thousands that work and pray for
you every day.
   ``You and your fellow hostages are not forgotten, Terry, and you
will never be. For every day that you suffer, thousands of
Americans agonize with you,'' Mrs. Say wrote.
   ``There is a God, Terry, and although neither you nor I can
guess why this terrible situation has been allowed to continue, we
must remain secure in the knowledge that some day, some way this
will end.
   ``Until then, please keep well and listen in the quiet for the
love and prayers that are sent to you and the others every hour,
every day. May God hold you close to him.''
   Former hostage Frank Reed said Dec. 30 that he had appealed to
Syrian President Hafez Assad to help free the 13 hostages.
   ``I beg you and all nations within the community of man to reach
into their wells of justice and sense of humanity and come to their
rescue,'' Reed wrote in a letter to Assad.
   ``What a perfect season for Syria to demonstrate to all
Americans and the world that its sense of humanity and human caring
goes beyond standing guard together in the sands of Arabia,'' the
letter said.
   Reed said he gave the letter to Syria's ambassador to Washington
on Dec. 14 but had not received a reply.
   ``Bothering me was the enormous attention paid in the media and
by our administration to people who were detained in Iraq and
living in special conditions that in no way could be comparable to
what the situation was in Lebanon,'' Reed said. ``So I decided to
take it upon myself and go to the Syrian government.''

<HEAD>Israeli Labor Court Overrules Paper's Dismissals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Tel Aviv court reversed the dismissals of 57
employees of the Jerusalem Post, saying the action violated a
labor-management accord.
   The dispute began with the company's announcement in November
that it would lay off the employees in economic cutbacks. On Dec.
3, 27 journalists were dismissed.
   About 70 staffers walked out, demanding that management uphold
an October agreement that outlines specific procedures for
dismissing workers. It also limits the number of private contracts
the company may sign with workers.
   In response to the walkout, management told some journalists to
sign private contracts or leave within 48 hours, staffers said.
``This was an attempt to break the union as well as a flagrant
violation of the agreement,'' said Dan Izenberg, a member of the
staff committee.
   An additional 30 journalists were dismissed following the
walkout.
   The labor court ruled Dec. 27 in favor of the staff committee,
which filed the complaints. It said the company must operate in
keeping with the October agreement.
   The Post, Israel's only English-language daily, has a daily
circulation of about 25,000 nationally. It prints an overseas
edition with a circulation of 50,000.

<HEAD>Italian TV Squelches Saddam Interview</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's state-owned television decided Dec. 28 not
to air an interview with Saddam Hussein, saying the broadcast might
``disturb the efforts'' for a peaceful solution to the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   The decision to squelch the broadcast indefinitely drew sharp
protest from reporters. The journalist who conducted the interview,
Bruno Vespa, threatened to resign.
   The director-general of RAI television, Gianni Pasquarelli,
announced the move in a letter to Vespa, the highly regarded
director of the nightly TG-1 news broadcast.
   ``Italy is president of the European Community and we must
avoid, in a moment of extreme delicacy, any act that could
contribute to disturb the efforts that are being made to find a
peaceful solution to the gulf crisis,'' said the letter, read on
the evening news show.
   It did not say how the interview might have affected peace
efforts.
   Vespa told viewers he disagreed with the decision. ``I expressed
to the director-general my surprise and my complete dissent,'' he
said.
   A RAI spokesman said he did not know if the Italian government
had asked the network to stop the broadcast. The government
finances RAI, and political parties have broad influence in its
operation.
   The editorial committee of the RAI said it supported Vespa in
the dispute.
   ``The invitation (by Pasquarelli) to not transmit the interview
appears like an act of self-censorship that the editorial staff of
TG-1 can not consider acceptible in any way,'' the committee said
in a statement.
   Pasquarelli, who belongs to the dominant Christian Democrat
Party, became director-general of RAI earlier this year after
serving as managing director of the state highway corporation. He
was previously a television journalist.
   The Christian Democrats control appointments at RAI-1, the
channel that broadcasts Vespa's program.
   The second-biggest party in the government, the Socialists, have
strong influence at RAI-2, another state-owned channel.

<HEAD>`Shevardnadze' Segments Blocked on Popular Soviet TV Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state broadcasting committee canceled two
segments of one of the country's most popular television programs
because of its political coverage, the show's host said Dec. 28.
   The segments of the weekly ``Vzglyad,'' Russian for
``viewpoint,'' were to include stories about outgoing Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, including a March interview in which
he said he considered quitting to protest shootings by Soviet
troops in his native Georgia, said the host, Alexander Lyubimov.
   Shevardnadze resigned Dec. 21, saying he feared hard-line
Communist forces were pushing the Soviet leadership into a
dictatorship.
   Program officials contended the cancellation was clearly
politically motivated and it indicated a return to state
censorship.
   The segments were to have been in the show's Dec. 28 and Jan. 4
broadcasts, Lyubimov said.
   Andrei Shipilov, an official at Central Television, said the
episodes were canceled ``for political reasons.''
   Lyubimov said ``Vzglyad'' could not ignore Shevardnadze's
resignation and warning or the Congress of People's Deputies' vote
to strengthen President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's powers.
   ``We are worried about the coincidence between this event and
the recent resignations of supporters of the liberal cause on
Gorbachev's team and the dramatic events at the Congress of
People's Deputies,'' he said.
   ``Vzglyad'' includes a game show, a historical section, and
American rock music in addition to the news segment. Lyubimov said
the other segments would be broadcast as usual.

<HEAD>Portuguese Government Sets Plan for Private TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced plans for
ending its 26-year-old monopoly on television, saying it will allow
two private channels to operate alongside the two existing official
channels.
   The new channels, which should begin operating in the summer of
1992, will still be closely regulated, spokesman Luis Marques
Mendes said Dec. 27. The government will control the length of
airtime reserved for news, educational shows and other programming,
he said.
   The center-right government of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco
Silva said prospective broadcasters will have three months from
Jan. 2 to present their plans and two will be chosen in June or
July.
   A reform of the Constitution in July 1989 allowed the government
to end the monopoly of the state-run Radio-Televisao Portuguesa.
   Initial enthusiasm for the project among Portuguese and foreign
businessmen has been dampened by recent studies casting doubt on
the local advertising market's capacity to support four channels.

   CNN televised live on Dec. 26 the first of what
it said will be weekly U.S. military briefings for reporters who
are in Saudi Arabia covering Operation Desert Shield.
   The briefings are being held in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, said
Steve Haworth, a spokeman for CNN. He said CNN will provide full or

events.
   The network's reports are seen in 100 countries, including Iraq.
   Ground rules forbid the disclosure of exactly where in Riyadh
the U.S. briefings are held. The Americans and Saudis have set up a
joint military command post in Riyadh to direct operations of their
troops in the event of war with Iraq.
   Shortly before Christmas, nearly 360 print and broadcast

<HEAD>Johnson Family Radio Stations Up for Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of the late President Johnson
has put the KLBJ radio stations on the market again.
   John Barr, executive vice president of LBJ Co., said Dec. 27
that the family had retained Ted Hepburn Co. to take offers for the
AM and FM stations.
   He said their value had been estimated at $13.5 million.
   The Johnson family has owned the business for more than 40
years. The family tried to sell it in 1987 for $27.5 million, but
the deal fell through when Chase Group, a New York-based investment
company, did not meet the deadline to complete the sale.
   Bill Jamar, whose Jamar and Associates handled the 1987 sales
attempt, said it would be hard to get $13.5 million in today's
economic climate.
   But Barr said, ``The stations are basically making money. They

<HEAD>FTC Staff Again Urges End to `Fin-Syn' Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economics staff of the Federal Trade
Commission said Dec. 26 that it again had urged the FCC to abolish
rules that keep broadcast television networks from owning program
rerun rights.
   The FTC's Economics Bureau first urged abolition of the rules in
September. It expanded its comments to include several proposed
modifications of the financial interest and syndication rules,
which commonly are called ``fin-syn.''
   One proposal would regulate negotiations between program
producers and networks, negotiations about which the economists
said, ``We do not find compelling reasons to adopt any of the
proposed restrictions.''
   A proposal that would modify but not abolish the rules ``may
lead to a result that is less desirable than either complete
elimination or complete retention of the rules,'' the bureau said.
   ``Our analysis of these options leads us to continue to believe
that the best course for the FCC is to repeal completely the
existing fin-syn rules,'' the bureau said.
   The Justice Department also has said the rules should be
eliminated.
   The FCC plans to decide in 1991 whether to keep, junk or change
the rules, which were adopted 20 years ago when the broadcast
networks had a much larger share of the prime-time viewing audience
than they have today.
   The rules permit the networks to own only the overseas rerun
rights to the prime-time shows they produce themselves and bar the
networks from any financial interest in other prime-time programs,
including off-network or ``syndicated'' showings.
   The FTC's Economics Bureau comments frequently on proposed
regulations of other federal agencies and state agencies, generally
urging views that would result in increased competition.

   Iraqi officials are applauding a separate European peace
initiative amid indications Saddam Hussein may compromise on a date
for high-level talks with the Bush administration on avoiding armed
conflict.
   But overtones of war continued to dominate pronouncements from
Baghdad.
   A government newspaper warned Sunday of terrorist attacks if
combat breaks out, and the country's information minister boasted
that Iraqis would ``show the world America is a paper tiger.''
   Saddam Hussein said in a New Year's message that because of the
threat of war a ``false happiness'' should pervade any holiday

   WASHINGTON - The Bush administration must try to find a
diplomatic solution to the Persian Gulf crisis before going to war,
top lawmakers say. But they disagree over whether to hold back
money if the fighting starts without congressional approval.
   ``A diplomatic effort really needs to be made and has to be made
before the decision to go to war,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Sunday.
   His thoughts were echoed by the Senate's ranking Republican, Bob
Dole of Kansas, who said he would like to see President Bush
``pursue at least one additional time'' a date for U.S.-Iraqi
discussions.
   ``The American people are not yet committed to war, and they
want to make certain that President Bush has done everything,
pursued every avenue for peace before the firing starts,'' Dole

its egg rolls and fried rice in boxes that violate Portland's

   Barrett, 44, a longtime environmental activist, is the ban's
enforcer. A local television reporter dubbed him StyroCop - a
takeoff on the movie ``RoboCop'' - his first day on the job and
he's become something of a celebrity.
   Barrett believes Americans must go beyond recycling by rejecting
products that are overpackaged and becoming accustomed to using
things again and again.
   ``As a recycler, our creed has always been reduce, reuse,
recycle,'' he says. ``Recycling is the last thing to do before you

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philippines is becoming a budget
Hollywood, attracting foreign filmmakers despite deteriorating
security and more than its share of natural disasters.
   James Glickenhaus, producer of ``McBain,'' said varied
locations, a professional local work crew and an English-speaking
population also make filming here easier.
   ``All in all, it was an extremely atrractive place for us to
shoot,'' Glickenhaus said. ``I would recommend it to other
filmmakers. It's a great place to shoot.''
   ``McBain,'' which was filmed here through December, is the
latest in a series of foreign movies shot in the Philippines.
Others include ``Apocalyse Now,'' ``Platoon,'' ``Born on the Fouth
of July,'' ``The Year of Living Dangerously'' and Chuck Norris'
``Delta Force'' series.
   ``McBain'' stars Christopher Walken, who won an Academy Award
for ``The Deer Hunter,'' and Venezuelan actress Maria Conchita
Alonzo, whose credits include ``Moscow on the Hudson'' with Robin
Williams and ``Running Man'' with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
   Glickenhaus, who is also the film's director and writer,
downplayed apprehensions about the security situation in the
country, which faces a 21-year communist rebellion and the
continuing threat from military extremists who have launched seven
armed uprisings in 4{ years.
   ``The perception of what the political situation here is really
a lot worst than I think the reality of it is,'' Glickenhaus said.
``If you read the papers in New York, you'd think it is unsafe and
you're going to be shot and you're gonna be blown up.
   ``Obviously, when you're here, I don't think, I don't feel that
I'm going to be shot or blown up.''
   His crew started filming here in October at about the same time
as a mutiny led by a renegade Army colonel erupted in the southern
Philippines, 500 miles south of Manila. The rebellion fizzled out
in three days.
   A series of at least 40 bombing attacks by rightist and leftist
extremists have occurred in the Manila area since August.
   In November, Typhoon Mike swept the central Philippines, killing
about 470 people.
   Walken said foreign members of the film were unaffected by these
incidents since they took place in areas far away from where they
were filming.
   ``I've been to many places and it's been quite normal,
uneventful here, except for the typhoon,'' Walken said.
   Glickenhaus said he used several provinces just on the outskirts
of Manila to shoot scenes that depict parts of three countries.
   The provincial capitol of Batangas province, south of Manila,
was turned into a Colombian presidential palace. A forest in nearby
Cavite province depicted a Vietnamese prison camp.
   Just west of Manila, the film crew built a Jamaican white sand
beach resort in the coast of Zambales province.
   The film also hired about 500 Filipino crew members and actors,
most of whom worked in Hollywood films shot here.
   The high cost of production in the United States, especially for
independent American film producers working on a tight budget,
makes shooting in the Philippines attractive. Glickenhaus said
``McBain,'' if shot in the United States, would have cost at least
double its $17 million budget.
   He said the film spent about $200,000 for a scene in which
thousands of extras were storming the Colombian presidential
palace. That scene would have cost $2 million if if had been shot
in Hollywood, he added.
   Most of the film's $17 million was expected to be spent here, to
the benefit of the local economy.
   Tom Gray, the film's publicist, said the widespread use of
English - one of the two official languages - gives the Philippines
an advantage over other Southeast Asian countries. He said it is
easy to give directions to Filipino actors and crew members because
they understand English.
   ``People still like making movies here,'' Glickenhaus said.
``That's a good thing.''

<HEAD>`Talking with David Frost' - The Short Course in Interviewing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Frost, preparing for the interview with
President and Mrs. Bush that airs tonight on PBS, was delighted to
share his knowledge on the art of the interview.
   Tonight's hourlong `` ... Talking with David Frost'' is the
first in a series of six by Frost, 50, a two-time Emmy Award winner
known here since the weekly satire ``That Was The Week That Was''
aired on U.S. TV in 1964.
   It was Frost who, in 1977, won worldwide attention with his
series of interviews with former President Richard Nixon.
   Future ``Talking'' episodes will feature Margaret Thatcher and
entertainer Robin Williams. Tonight's interview with the Bushes was
not available at press time. Here, then, is the David Frost Short
Course on the Interview:
   ``T.S. Eliot said a work of art has a life of its own,'' Frost
said, settling back into his chair. ``Although I wouldn't claim
that an interview is a work of art, it does have a life of its
own.''
   I. Preparation Is Important.
   ``Some people think the more preparation you do, the more it
shackles you to a prepared plan,'' he said. ``The truth of good
homework or good research, is it liberates you to go with the flow
of the interview. ...
   ``The less you know the more you have to stick to your set
questions.
   ``The other thing is, it saves you from boring the pants off
somebody.''
   Frost said he and a staff of four compiled three thick binders
of research and background for tonight's interview with the first
couple. From that, Frost transposes his questions, background and
quotes onto cardboard folders.
   ``On those folders, there's a game plan - but it ain't sacred,''
he said.
   For the famed ``Nixon Interviews,'' which yielded six hours of
television from 28} hours of interviews over 12 days, Frost said he
had four journalists working for a year to prepare for it.
   II. Know When to Shut Up.
   ``There are silences in interviews, and in television
interviews, silence is an eternity,'' he said. ``There are two
sorts of silences. One is where you just sense that if you shut up,
the person will go on and say perhaps more than they were going to
say.
   ``And then there's another sort of silence where you realize the
person has forgotten completely what the hell they were going to
say. And that silence is one that you'd better fill as fast as
possible.''
   III. The Importance of Listening.
   ``Obviously, the most important thing is listening. That is so
transparently obvious that it seems unnecessary to say it. But so
many times people have said to me `It's so good that you really
listen.' So I guess not everybody does.''
   He recalled being interviewed in England by a radio host who
followed a questions list without listening to the answers. Frost
said at first he tried to be kind, saying ``I'm glad you got back
to that.'' He soon tired of it.
   ``In the end, it got irresistible. I ended one answer by saying,
`And then of course, I married the pope's first wife.' And the guy
said, `But what do you feel about the future of the Common
Market?'''
   IV. Turn an Interview into a Conversation as Soon as Possible.
   ``That's so there's interplay, so that both people become
absorbed in the conversation,'' he said. ``I don't mean they become
absorbed in the conversation to the point where they forget
themselves, but where they forget the cameras, the lights and so
on.''
   V. On Being Lied To
   ``There are occasions when you do have to become not just the
catalyst but the principal,'' he said. ``And that is when you feel,
to use a splendid euphemism, that the facts are being done a
disservice - Churchill used the phrase, `When you feel someone is
guilty of a terminological inexactitude.'
   ``In those circumstances, you do have to become a principal, and
then you do have to press and then you do have to repeat the
question, and then you do have to repeat the facts that you think
contradict what the person's just said, and sometimes you have to
return to it again and again, and say, `But. Yes, but ...'''
   VI. On the Roles of the Interviewer
   ``You do, sometimes, have to adopt varying roles,'' Frost said.
He cited the first day of the Nixon interviews, in which Nixon
stonewalled questions about the Watergate affair.
   ``It was prosecution and defense,'' Frost said. ``When he came
back on the second day, having realized the total stonewall did not
work, he was prepared to volunteer something - not enough, as it
turned out - and then suddenly the atmosphere became more of the
confessional.
   ``Then on an entirely different subject, the breakthrough to
China, there I was Boswell to his Johnson.''
   VII. On Having Paid Nixon to Be Interviewed
   ``I paid $600,000 for six hours on the air and NBC News, who
were the semifinalists as it were, the runnersup, had offered
$400,000 for two hours. So I wasn't the only person who doing it.
   ``So I offered more money, but I got a better rate per hour.''
   ---
   Elsewhere in television . . .
   AND SPEAKING OF `THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS' DEPT. - NBC's
planned debut of ``Sunday Best,'' a comedic review of the week on
TV, was to be Jan. 13, a Sunday.
   Then it was pushed back to Feb. 3, to the suicide slot opposite
CBS' ``60 Minutes.''
   The network cited ``uncertainties of postseason football games''
that could delay the start of ``Sunday Best,'' and affect the
premiere of ``Dark Shadows,'' the four-hour TV movie airing on Jan.
13-14.

<HEAD>Truckers Who Blew Whistle Unemployed, Feel Ostracized</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James and Rikki Pomerenke fought to make
the nation's food safer. As a result, they no longer feel safe.
   The truckdrivers keep five loaded guns in their Yakima home for
protection. Unemployed for more than a year, they contend they have
been blackballed by the local trucking industry because they
exposed the practice of hauling toxic chemicals and food products
in the same tankers.
   With fellow truckers Dave Helzer and Sharon Sonner, they
revealed that some trucking companies required drivers to deliver
dangerous chemicals in one load, then wash out the tanker and fill
it with food grade products on the backhaul.
   Their whistleblowing resulted in a new federal law signed in
early November by President Bush that restricted such cross-hauling
practices.
   The law requires clear labeling to identify tankers for sole use
with foods or chemicals. It also gives truckers the right to refuse
an illegal backhaul.
   The law will increase the down time for truckers, making it more
difficult to get lucrative backhauls, the Pomerenkes said.
   Still, Cliff Harvison, president of National Tank Truck Carriers
Inc. in Alexandria, Va., said much of the industry supports what
the Pomerenkes did.
   ``They are good, decent, honest moral people,'' Harvison said.
``They did the right thing.''
   But doing the right thing has not made life easy for the
Pomerenkes. They say they have been ostracized by friends and are
running out of money. They claim that they have been threatened,
and warned by former co-workers that they could face physical harm.
   ``We are at the end of our rope,'' said Pomerenke, 45.
   ``It's real hard for me to deal with,'' said Rikki Pomerenke,
40. ``We don't have any friends anymore.''
   The central Washington city of 55,000 is a major producer of
fruits and vegetables, with a large trucking industry.
   ``Down here people didn't have an axe to grind and were not
bound economically with the fruit and agriculture community of
Yakima,'' Ms. Sonner said. ``There's loose cannons any place and
any time.''
   Helzer and Sonner have left Yakima; they moved to Hermiston,
Ore., after the publicity started to overwhelm them, and after
Helzer's truck was broken into twice. While they did not feel they
had been blackballed, they thought there were better prospects for
steady employment elsewhere, Ms. Sonner said.
   The Pomerenkes are long-time residents of Yakima. They have
family there, and they don't want to move.
   They contend they have applied to numerous trucking companies
for jobs, and are turned down as soon as the employer learns who
they are. They declined to name any of the trucking companies.
   The Pomerenkes acknowledged there has been at least one local
job offer, but they turned it down because the pay was less than
the prevailing scale.
   The Pomerenkes live on a $1,500 per month disability check for a
hand injury Rikki suffered while operating a jackhammer on a
construction job last year. James receives unemployment.
   Ms. Sonner said neither couple was aware of the attention their
whistleblowing would bring.
   ``In all honesty, I don't think the four of us would have had
enough nerve to go through with it,'' Ms. Sonner said. ``It's scary
to have someone from D.C. call up and say, `Please testify before
Congress.'''
   The Pomerenkes have filed a lawsuit against their former
employer in Yakima County Superior Court. The lawsuit contends that
former employer, Premium Transport, has hurt their ability to get
work by ``unlawful termination, outrageous conduct, defamation and
breach of contract.''
   That company is defunct. Former president James Ketchum, also a
defendant in the lawsuit, has declined to return numerous telephone
messages.
   The Pomerenkes had been construction workers in the Yakima area
for about 15 years when they decided to seek steady employment
together as a long-haul driving team in late 1987.
   ``What we learned in the year and a half made me sick,'' said
Mrs. Pomerenke.
   The lawsuit contends they were asked to lie about their previous
load when using tanker washing facilities, and to lie to shippers
about their most recent load when picking up food after hauling
chemicals.
   They hauled juice, wine and milk after hauling items like
inedible tallow and plastic resin, which is used to make foam
insulation.
   In May 1989, the Pomerenkes refused to haul a chemical from the
Midwest to the West Coast. Returning with their empty tanker to
Yakima, they were fired.
   They are angry about the treatment they have received since they
went to Washington to testify.
   ``I'm an American and I love my country and it's obvious from
what we've done that we care about it,'' James Pomerenke said.
``It's strange that there are no laws to protect people who step
forward.''

<HEAD>Teens Sentenced By Their Peers in Special Court</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jury was tough on the girl who was accused of
trespassing and harassment at a middle school: She was sentenced to
20 hours of community service, and was ordered to stay away from
the school.
   A 15-year-old boy who swore at his science teacher in class
received similar treatment: 20 hours of community service, and a
written apology - three pages, front and back - to school
officials.
   Each also was sentenced to serve two jury stints in this same
court - the Teen Court, a place where teen-agers are tried by a
jury of their teen peers.
   ``These are kids who are just beginning to get into trouble,''
said Janice Church, head of the Denver Bar Association's Teen Court
advisory board. ``This is a kind of early intervention program, an
alternative forum to correct the behavior of kids.''
   The program, launched last month after more than a year of
planning, is modeled after ones in Odessa, Texas, and Tarrytown,
N.Y. But Denver is the first major city to implement the program.
   The six-member juries impose real sentences in a real courtroom
presided over by a retired juvenile court judge. The lawyers and
prosecutors are teen-agers. The court meets twice a month, and
though it is limited to three schools at first, it soon will be
expanded.
   The cases involve minor offenses that could wind up before the
district attorney's office, as well as serious violations of school
policy that could result in a several-day suspension.
   By opting for Teen Court, the defendants instead face up to 40
hours of community service, up to four tours as a juror and
possibly having to apologize - usually in a formal letter - to the
victims.
   David Chaffee, the bar association's Teen Court coordinator,
drafts a contract that the teen-agers sign, choosing community
service that fits the crime and the defendant.
   The defendants must complete their sentences of community
service and jury duty or face punishment in juvenile court or
discipline by school officials.
   Church said Teen Court gives all participants a chance to feel
they are part of the system. And it should make a difference that
their peers are the ones who decide the punishment.
   ``Kids react to negative peer pressure,'' said Church. ``Maybe
they'll react to positive peer pressure.''
   ``I think kids may hope that people their own age will be more
lenient,'' said Lorelei Ockers, a student at Abraham Lincoln High
School in southwest Denver and a member of the Teen Court advisory
board.
   The trespasser, an accomplice and the profane boy, all Lincoln
students, were the first three defendants. If they were counting on
soft treatment, they probably were disappointed.
   Melanie Lucero, lawyer for the boy who swore at his science
teacher, tried to paint a picture of a youth struggling to do the
right thing despite an ongoing personality clash with the teacher.
   ``I was having a bad day, and I was trying to have a very
important conversation,'' the 10th-grader explained.
   But jurors stared at the boy as prosecutor Donnell Vigil made
him repeat the two swear words he uttered that day. Judge Roger
Cisneros peered sternly at him over his glasses.
   Vigil, who wants to be a lawyer, exuded indignation as she told
the six jurors that no student, no matter how bad his day is going,
should swear at a teacher and disrupt the learning process.
   ``I got more than I wanted,'' said Vigil, after the sentencing.
   In the other case, lawyer Christa Goetz maintained that her two
clients accused of trespassing would not have visited the school
after it was closed if they had known it violated school policy.
One defendant said she wanted to talk to the principal about her
sister.
   But prosecutor Paul Rodriguez presented letters from the
principal accusing the teen-agers of harassing two students. He
said both had attended the junior high school, and knew the rules.
   Though one of the defendants received a stiff sentence, the
other got the Teen Court equivalent of a slap on the wrist - eight
hours of community service, one jury tour and a written apology.
   Why the disparity? Goetz, obviously not yet skilled in the
lawyerly art of artful dodging, said: ``I feel they maybe picked up
that she (the first girl) wasn't telling the truth.''

<HEAD>Price Gouging or Prudency?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Price gouging at the gasoline pumps? Not at all.
Simply prudent behavior.
   Who says so? Professor McKenzie says so. Richard McKenzie,
professor of finance and economics at the University of
Mississippi, and somewhat of a rarity in his ability to assemble
scholarly data in clarifying popular issues.
   True, McKenzie is a believer in the ability of the marketplace
to make intelligent adjustments to changes in supply and demand,
but he assumes that you too believe in that system. Or do you?
   As a participant in the real estate market - most people are
participants, as owners or renters - you might find of special
interest this aspect of his argument:
   ``The charge that producers should not profit from the Iraqi
crisis is about as sensible as claiming that homeowners in Los
Angeles who bought their houses in the 1950s are morally bound not
to profit when selling them.''
   If homeowners do not collect their accumulated profits, asks the
professor, how will they be able to replace their homes. They
cannot, he suggests, declare that the marketplace should
accommodate them. Of course not.
   Besides, if they decline to take profits, that doesn't mean the
profits aren't there. It means only that the owner-seller declines
to accept them; the profits will be passed on to the buyer, who
will collect them on the next resale.
   Except for his strong belief in free markets, McKenzie has no
known reason to defend oil companies. His identification with the
subject is academic, as a professor, and as a fellow of the Center
for the Study of American Business, based on the campus of St.
Louis' Washington University.
   In that latter regard, he produced ``Working Paper 137,''
detailing his findings and conclusions.
   -Taking 1967 as a base year, the price of a gallon of gasoline
($1.38 at the time the paper was written) had risen less since 1960
than the price of the basket of goods that goes into the
calculation of the consumer price index.
   -Uncle Sam has a bit to do with those higher pump prices.
Gasoline taxes were 10.5 cents a gallon in 1960. They rose to 14.5
cents in 1981 and to 26.9 cents in July 1990. And, of course, they
have just risen again.
   -The quality of gasoline has risen, providing more miles to the
gallon and less pollution too. American consumers are now spending
a much smaller percent of disposable income on gasoline than in
1970 or earlier decades.
   In 1989, McKenzie states, ``gasoline expenditures for the
`typical' consumer as a percent of his or her disposable income
fell precipitously to less than one-half of the 1970 level and to
almost a third of the 1980 level.''
   McKenzie makes this effort - stressed in his paper - to describe
recent pricing events at the pump, which a great many Americans
have chosen to call gouging:
   ``Oil markets must not only account for current reductions in
supplies but also must seek to anticipate the prospects of further
declines in the oil supplies.''
   When production of any good or service involves delivery at a
future time, he explains, ``then competitive prices reflect both
current and expected future supplies.''
   It is like the Los Angeles homeowner who must worry about
earning enough on the sale of his present house to buy another,
especially if the housing market, like the oil market, is volatile
and unpredictable.
   For oil companies and service stations to deny the future
uncertainty of their markets would have been folly, says McKenzie,
who repeats:
   ``The major cost of staying in business is not the past purchase
price of any item in inventory but the future replacement cost of
that item.''
   If there has been collusion with the industry or a conspiracy to
gouge the public, McKenzie says that those involved have done a
mighty poor job of it.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stephen Schwartz and John Caird have been involved
in some of Broadway's biggest hits, but they were adamant about
launching their new show, ``Children of Eden,'' in London.
   ``It has to do with working style,'' Schwartz, 42, said of the
$3.86 million-musical, opening Jan. 8 at the Prince Edward Theater.
   ``It's a much more pleasant and focused working experience,''
the composer-lyricist said of London's commercial West End.
``There's much less of the power and ego games I've experienced in
New York, that frenzy of threats and tears and firings.''
   The greater quantity of theater in London than on Broadway means
there is less hysteria attached to each individual show. Also, the
price is right: ``Children of Eden'' on Broadway would cost double
its West End budget, Schwartz said.
   Schwartz has had three substantial New York hits - ``Godspell,''
``The Magic Show'' and ``Pippin'' - as well as such flops as
``Working'' and, most recently, the 1986 ``Rags.''
   ``Children of Eden,'' which uses the book of Genesis to tell a
cautionary tale about the world today, is the first major London
opening of 1991.
   It's the first collaboration of Schwartz, a New Yorker who now
lives in Connecticut, and Caird, the English co-director of
``Nicholas Nickleby'' and ``Les Miserables.''
   The 35-person cast is headed by Ken Page, the American star of
``Cats'' and ``Ain't Misbehavin','' as God; Kevin Colson, a Tony
nominee in June for ``Aspects of Love,'' as Noah; and Frances
Ruffelle, a Tony-winner for ``Les Miserables,'' as Yonah.
   Caird and Schwartz have been polishing ``Children of Eden'' for
three years following a 1985 workshop of a separate version of it,
entitled ``The Family Tree,'' which did not involve Caird.
   The London staging was first planned for The Royal Shakespeare
Company, where ``Les Miserables'' began in 1984. It shifted to the
commercial West End when the Company decided to close its two
London theaters for the winter in order to save money.
   Caird said his new project had the initial appeal of ``Les
Miserables,'' which has gone on to become the most internationally
successful musical ever.
   ``I fell hopelessly in love with Stephen's songs on first
hearing, just like I did with the score of `Les Mis,''' Caird said
in an interview.
   The first act recounts the Creation and the fall of man. The
second act, said Caird, ``is an imaginative version of life in the
late 20th century where the children of Eden - man and animals -
are no longer living in harmony.
   ``Each is being cannibalized by the other.''
   Schwartz said any similarities to his 1971 ``Godspell,'' his
most popular show to date, are coincidental: ``You couldn't really
make comparisons.''
   But he acknowledged ``Children of Eden'' is a risky venture, not
least because no surefire names are attached to it.
   ``We don't have Julia McKenzie's name up there; we don't have
Andrew Lloyd Webber's name up there,'' said Schwartz. McKenzie is
the acclaimed current star of Stephen Sondheim's ``Into the Woods''
in London. Lloyd Webber has four long-running musicals on the West
End.
   ``I'm very, very exposed in this show,'' he said.
   While musicals often postpone opening nights to allow their
creators to hone the show further, ``Children of Eden,'' unusually,
moved its premiere forward from Jan. 16 to Jan. 8.
   ``Frankly, it was a financial decision,'' explained Schwartz.
``It's difficult to sell the previews without the notices, and
until those notices are out, people are not going to buy tickets.''
   If the show clicks in London, Schwartz said he would then brave
Broadway.
   ``It's not that I'm allergic to the air in New York,'' he said.
``Commercially, it's still the best thing that can happen to a
show.''

   Peter Martins tries to capture the individual
spirit of each ballerina when creating works about them for the New
York City Ballet company's ballerinas.
   ``You try to capture what each woman is about, what her virtues
are and so forth,'' said Martins, who has been ballet master in
chief of the New York City Ballet since the death of George
Balanchine in 1983. ``You also try and see if you can bring out
something else in them.''
   Five ballets or excerpts from ballets choreographed by Martins
on five ballerinas will be aired by PBS on Jan. 11 at 9 p.m. EST.
``Ballerinas: Dances by Peter Martins'' is part the Great
Performances series.
   ``I would say for the most part this is basically the way I have
seen these women,'' says Martins, who retired from dancing to
devote full time to running the company. ``They all used to be my
partners.
   ``When you're dancing with them, you're preoccupied with being a
part of a picture yourself. You're much less observant about their
particular qualities then. When you take a step back and look at
them from a creative point of view, something else emerges.''
   All five dances in the TV program were created by Martins after
he stopped dancing. He doesn't choreograph on paper in an office.
He choreographs ``on the dancers,'' physically having them move in
a studio.
   Kyra Nichols and Adam Luders dance ``Beethoven Romance.''
   ``Kyra has such strength and such resilience that you can give
her the most difficult things and yet they will come across as
looking very easy and simple,'' Martins said.
   ``She keeps challenging you to do more. She can stay longer on
pointe, unsupported, than most. There is a lot of strength there, a
lot of power.''
   Patricia McBride and Ib Andersen dance ``Valse Triste.''
   ``It was toward the end of Patti's career and I saw the softness
in her, which had always appealed to me,'' Martins said. ``Patti
used to be considered a soubrette, a small dancer who moves very
quickly. A lot of ballets Mr. B did on her in her youth were like
that.
   ``It was her lyrical qualities that appealed to me. It's as if
nature makes her dance. It is like snow and rain and the wind and
the sun. It is all natural, nothing forced. It appears that you put
a wand over her and she just moves.''
   Heather Watts and Jock Soto dance the second movement of the
modern ``Ecstatic Orange.''
   ``They all challenge me in various ways. Heather's challenge is
much about architecture,'' said Martins. ``It becomes creating
images. It is about sculpting bodies. ... There is always a new
sculpture emerging.
   ``Also there is an element of the unknown when you work with
Heather, an unpredictability. You may try to get one movement out
of her and another one will emerge. That's always fascinating; you
get a lot of help.''
   Merrill Ashley and Adam Luders are joined by former Paul Taylor
dancers Kate Johnson and David Parsons in ``Barber Violin
Concerto.''
   ``Merrill is the epitome of the classical technician,'' Martins
said. ``There was a part of Merrill I have always felt was looming
underneath the surface, which was the passionate Merrill. I don't
think she has had a dance like that done on her. I wanted to bring
that to the surface. This is the passionate Merrill, not the
technical Merrill we see every day.''
   Suzanne Farrell, in her farewell ballet, and Martins,
temporarily back from retirement, dance ``Sophisticated Lady.''
   ``Suzanne is in many ways more American than any of them. One of
the things she has excelled in is her showgirl aspect, as in
`Slaughter on Tenth Avenue.' So, I thought, why not make her a
little dance that celebrates that part of her, where she can go out
on stage and be Rita Hayworth, gloriously beautiful and not having
to do very much. Neither of us was prepared to do a major pas de
deux on pointe. I am an old retiree.
   ``It is she and I playing Fred and Ginger. Anybody who loves
dance has somewhere in them a deep, deep admiration for Ginger
Rogers and Fred Astaire. I wanted for us to play that role for a
moment.''
   The PBS show is co-produced by WNET and Danmarks Radio. Dances
were filmed in Denmark.

   It's the same old story.
   Boy meets girl. Boy gets girl. Boy bills girl for grooming of
schnauzer. Girl makes tuna fish for boy, again and again. Boy and
girl sit atop the high-powered world of publishing. Girl divorces
boy.
   OK, maybe the story of Richard Snyder and Joni Evans is not the
same old story. It certainly has had a novel ending; both sides
want a judge to declare the other's ``celebrity status'' a marital
asset, give it a dollar value and divvy it up just like the family
house, furniture and other belongings.
   Snyder and Evans each claimed to have made the other what he or
she is today. And to prove the point, they were willing to fling
major mud.
   The case has more than gossip value. Divorce lawyers are
watching it and similar cases to see whether the courts will agree
that fame should be appraised and its value apportioned.
   ``It's an idea whose time hopefully will never come,'' said
attorney Raoul Felder, who's fighting to keep Metropolitan Opera
diva Frederica von Stade's husband from claiming a piece of her
stardom.
   But Marvin Mitchelson, who represents Roseanne Barr's ex-husband
Bill Pentland, hopes to win the first California case based on the
principle.
   ``The attaining of celebrity status during the marriage ... is a
definite asset, just as appreciation of a house or an art
collection is an asset,'' he argues. ``I think it is slowly being
recognized.''
   The story of Evans and Snyder, played out in a New York
courtroom last spring, is light on hearts and violins and heavy on
the bottom line.
   Snyder, head of Simon &amp; Shuster, hired Evans as director of
subsidiary rights in 1974. She'd advanced to associate publisher by
1976 when they began dating. Two years later, they married at City
Hall - during their lunch hour.
   Theirs was an egalitarian marriage, though he always out-earned
her. Bank accounts were separate. His assistant billed her monthly
for her share of the food, utilities and schnauzer-grooming bills,
she testified.
   In 1979, Snyder created an imprint (a semi-autonomous shop
within a larger publishing house) called Linden Press for Evans to
run. It was a success.
   She says the marriage began to break down in 1985, when Snyder
promoted her to president of the trade book division and she was
working directly under him again. Snyder, who has publicly
complained about her workaholism, testified that the marriage
``went south'' two years earlier.
   They agreed to separate in 1986 and she filed for divorce in
February 1987, resigning from Simon &amp; Schuster at the same time to
join Random House.
   Had they agreed to an out-of-court property settlement, the case
might have ended there. Instead, the history of their marriage was
recounted in public.
   Evans said Snyder aimed a tennis ball at her during an argument
on the tennis court. Snyder said Evans put him ``in a very
humiliating and embarrassing and ... emotionally unhappy position''
by turning her back on him at a publishing convention.
   The last time they had conjugal relations? ``The weekend of July
4, 1986,'' Evans testified, matter-of-factly.
   Evans said she cooked and cleaned when the maid was off duty,
but conceded she made ``tuna fish 75 percent of the time.''
   Even then, Snyder said, he opened the can and removed the tuna,
``because that was the dangerous part.''
   Evans, 48, who now heads her own imprint at Random House,
contended in her pretrial memorandum she acted as Snyder's
``sounding board,'' entertained his corporate bosses (Simon &amp;
Schuster is owned by Paramount Communications), participated in
business decisions and served as ``a source of emotional stability
and as moral anchor.''
   That, she said, entitles her to a share of the marital estate,
which she estimates at more than $18 million.
   On the contrary, answered the 57-year-old Snyder. She would be
nothing without him, he argued, so he should get a cut of all her
future earnings.
   ``She is the very opposite of the wife who sacrifices her own
career or performs unremunerated services for the benefit of her
spouse and family,'' he argued in court papers made available to
The Associated Press.
   ``In significant part as a result of his efforts, she is today
one of the highest paid and most powerful executives in the
publishing industry.''
   Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Elliot Wilk has reserved
decision.
   A decade ago, the Snyder-Evans contretemps would have been an
impossibility. Judges simply awarded property to the spouse who
held the title - usually the husband - while providing alimony to
the untitled spouse.
   But in 1980, New York's laws were revised to protect the spouse
whose contribution was non-monetary. In New York and 41 other
states, judges must now make an ``equitable distribution'' of all
property acquired during the marriage, regardless of who holds the
title.
   Then, in a landmark 1985 case, New York's top court ruled that a
woman who gave up her career to put her husband through medical
school, only to be divorced two months after he got his license,
must be compensated with a share of the husband's medical license.
   A New Jersey judge took that concept one step farther, awarding
Joe Piscopo's ex-wife $50,000, or half the value placed on his
celebrity status. The state's highest court upheld the award in May
1989.
   Mitchelson hopes similar logic will prevail in his case against
Roseanne Barr. He argues that her ex-husband helped launch her
career in comedy clubs, was the main parent and homemaker while she
was on the road and auditioning, then worked with her to launch her
hit ABC show and wrote some of the scripts.
   ``Here you've got clearly a career that was made and developed
during the marriage,'' he said. Barr's current earnings ``are a
thousand times more than they were because of what happened during
the marriage.''
   Alfred Ferrer, attorney for Frederica von Stade's former
husband, Peter Elkus, is appealing a ruling declaring the singer's
career was not a marital asset. He too describes marriage in terms
more numismatic than romantic.
   ``Marriage is an economic partnership,'' he said. ``If one's
career is enhanced during that partnership, each spouse has a right
to participate in that value.''

<HEAD>Its Boom Fades but Northwest Still Shines Above National Gloom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He has no job and no money for rent, but
carpenter Reuben Soto still believes the Northwest's economy is
tops in the nation.
   Trouble is, he's right.
   In the late 1980s, the Northwest became the jewel of the U.S.
economy, sparkling atop charts of economic growth and livability.
The region still outshines the gloomy national economy, but that's
not saying much. As Reuben Soto discovered firsthand, the great
Northwest boom is fading.
   He came from Virginia last summer, a 35-year-old bachelor
looking for work and a fresh start in life. He'd heard times were
good around Seattle, and sure enough, things started out well. Soto
landed a carpentry job and rented a small apartment.
   But then Seattle's hot housing market cooled and construction
slowed. Soto was laid off in November, and he's been hunting for
work ever since.
   ``I'm going through some rough times now,'' he said. ``But I
know it will get better. This is still a land of opportunity.''
   He's not the only optimist in town. Many economists say the
Northwest, though slowing down, is likely to escape the worst of a
widespread downturn. A newly diversified economy, growing Asian
trade, and banner years for aerospace giant Boeing have stabilized
the region, once infamous for sliding to the bottom of national
recessions.
   ``We're not going to be immune to what's happening elsewhere,''
said John W. Mitchell, chief economist for U.S. Bancorp in
Portland, Ore. ``But you're still talking about the strongest
region in the country.''
   Indeed, the strong growth of recent years has put the Northwest
on solid footing to face economic challenges:
   -Measured by employment, the region far exceeded average U.S.
growth in the year ending October. Employment in Washington, Oregon
and Idaho combined grew at twice the national rate. Add Nevada and
Utah, the nation's fastest-growing states, and regional employment
grew 3.8 percent, nearly triple the 1.3 percent U.S. rate.
   -All five Northwestern states last year were among the nation's
top 10 in growth of residents' personal income.
   -In Washington, The Boeing Co. nearly doubled its work force
between 1983 and 1990. With more than 100,000 workers, the
airplane-maker now accounts directly or indirectly for one of every
six Washington jobs.
   -In Idaho, Oregon and Utah, diversification featuring high-tech
electronics and computer industries has evened out the ups and
downs of formerly resource-based economies. ``Our growth has been
broad-based,'' said Michael Ferguson, Idaho's chief economist.
``We've got the good fortune of having the right product mix.''
   So much for the good news. If 1990 culminated several years of
heady Northwestern growth, it also was when the region started
pulling in its horns.
   In Washington, Boeing finished its hiring binge. The company is
still a strong stabilizing force - it has orders for jets it won't
deliver until after the turn of the century - but the impetus
behind Seattle's population boom is gone.
   The housing market has responded accordingly. In 1989, Seattle
had the nation's fastest-rising home prices. By the end of 1990,
home prices were stagnant, and houses sat on the market for months.
New construction fell off sharply.
   State economists declared in November that Washington had
entered a mild recession. They predicted the state would lose
10,000 jobs by June, a .5 percent drop in total employment, and
then resume growing slowly.
   Idaho's rapid growth will slow considerably during the next
three years, Ferguson said.
   Perhaps the most worrisome Northwestern state is Oregon, where
more than 30 percent of factory jobs depend on the beleaguered
timber industry. A nationwide housing slump has reduced demand for
timber, and supply is shrinking due to logging restrictions aimed
at protecting the spotted owl, a threatened species. State
economists predict 5,400 timber jobs will disappear in 1991.
   ``The forest industry is Oregon's Achilles heel,'' said Michael
J. Parks, editor of Marple's Business Newsletter in Seattle.
   Economists say such negative factors are cooling the Northwest's
hot growth down to a lukewarm prosperity.
   ``Our economy will behave and grow more like the rest of the
country,'' predicted Douglas Pedersen, economist at Security
Pacific Bank Washington. ``We'll be growing faster than the
nationa average, but the margin will be a little thinner.''
   That's still attractive to regions mired in recession. But the
Northwest formula may be hard to match elsewhere.
   Some economists believe this region's fortune hinges on
``industries of the future'' such as software and biotechnology,
which benefit more from worker satisfaction than closeness to
markets or raw materials.
   Such ``footloose'' industries are lured by the Northwest's
fabled natural beauty and high quality of life, not by tax breaks
or other government incentives, said U.S. Bancorp's Mitchell.
   ``Oregon, Washington and Idaho have three totally different tax
structures, but they're all growing,'' Mitchell said. ``It's not
policy. We're just lucky.''

<HEAD>Putting the Priority on Teaching at Selected Universities</HEAD>

   Kenneth Jackson, Frederick Coolidge, Laura Goodwin and Frank S.
Pinet belong to an endangered species - college professors
designated as superb teachers.
   Each works at a huge, multi-campus research university where
hundreds of millions of dollars flow into research and where
faculty prestige comes with out-of-the-classroom projects.
   Yet each is prized for outstanding classroom skills.
   ``Great research and great teaching fuel each other,'' said
Michael I. Sovern, president of Columbia University. ``Yet we must
acknowledge that great universities like ours are at risk of
tilting in favor of research at the expense of teaching. And we
must not let that happen.
   ``In America today, the great teacher is an endangered
species.''
   Jackson, who has taught at Columbia for 22 years, is one of 10
educators recently appointed to professorships created with gifts
of more than $12 million.
   Coolidge, Goodwin and about 25 other professors working at one
of the four University of Colorado campuses are being encouraged to
teach and suggest how less-experienced professors can become better
in the classroom. The professors are given $6,000 a year for two
years and the lifetime title of ``President's Teaching Scholars.''
   ``We are more encouraged than ever now to take up our mandate to
educate, even though our faculty members do remarkable research,''
aid Mary Ann Shea, the university's program coordinator, who works
from the Boulder, Colo., campus. ``Our mandate is to educate
students, our mandate is to concentrate more on how students learn
and how we can best teach them.''
   Pinet is a distinguished teaching professor of business at the
University of Kansas, which first established endowed Distinguished
Teaching Professorships in 1957.
   The Lawrence, Kan., school now has more than 125 distinguished
professorships, 22 of which explicitly recognize outstanding
teaching.
   At the University of Missouri, President C. Peter Magrath
recently created an annual Presidential Award for Outstanding
Teaching. The award includes a $15,000 stipend available to tenured
faculty members with a record of outstanding teaching for at least
10 years.
   Lynne Cheney, who chairs the National Endowment for the
Humanities, has said emphasis on outside studies is greatest at
``research universities'' where 64 percent of the faculty report
spending five hours or less per week on formal classroom
instruction and 86 percent report spending six or more hours per
week on research.
   The typical reward for good teaching ``is a couple of thousand
dollars and a pat on the back,'' said Peter Smith, a spokesman for
the Association of American Universities. ``The Colorado program is
clearly more than that.''
   Now in its second year, Colorado University - with its
four-campus system and 43,000 student population - has an elaborate
selection process by which faculty, deans and students participate
in selecting tenured professors from the 3,000-member faculty.
   For 1990-91, 12 scholars were appointed from the campuses. In
1989-90, 15 were appointed.
   ``The significance of the program is that master teachers work
with faculty colleagues, as opposed to working with graduate
students, who we know we're going to send off from our
institutions. In this case, we're trying to work with faculty
members who have never had any experience in talking about teaching
with a faculty colleague and learning new ways to teach,'' Shea
said.
   Part of the university's psychology department on its Colorado
Springs campus, Coolidge is clearly excited about designing a
course for professors and lecturers, entitled ``How to Teach More
Effectively.'' His goal, he said, is to help show how humor,
stories and parables strategically placed in lectures can create a
pleasant learning environment.
   Rex Burns of the university's Denver campus, said those who will
fare best in the classroom are the most empathetic.
   ``You have to have an ability to put yourself in place of the
students looking at the teacher,'' he said, ``and perhaps even
listening to yourself in the classroom, as others see you.''

<HEAD>Kansas City Barbecue: Not Just Blowing Smoke</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRAIG HORST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You can argue about whether Memphis or
North Carolina or Texas has better barbecue. You can argue about
the proper sauce, the proper meat, the proper fuel.
   But there is no argument about one simple fact: Kansas City
takes its barbecue very seriously.
   Kansas City is home to the world's most famous barbecue
restaurant, Arthur Bryant's. Jack Nicholson is known to interrupt
coast-to-coast trips to eat there. Writer (and native Kansas
Citian) Calvin Trillin, ribs partly in cheek, once called Bryant's
the best restaurant anywhere.
   And some swear the Gates &amp; Sons chain is even better. The sweet
aroma of barbecue overwhelms all bus and truck fumes at one busy
midtown intersection right next to Ollie Gates' Rib Tech, where
future cookers learn the science.
   There are many other mom-and-pop joints that lay claim to the
title of best barbecue around. But the real barbecue, the REAL
THING, is cooked by the legion of people who haul homemade smokers
to competitions around the region.
   ``It's a very tight community,'' said Gary Wells, who doubles as
an insurance agent when he's not tending to matters of the meat as
president of the Kansas City Barbecue Society, which has more than
500 members.
   ``They are serious about having fun. They are serious about
cooking too. They like things that are a little off-center. It's
every kind of person. We've got doctors, lawyers, forklift
drivers,'' he said.
   And some are even in unexpected places. KCBS members Jim and
Kathleen Tabb recently judged a barbecue contest in Ireland (the
food was good) and then moved on to another competition in Estonia,
where they had an official visit with the mayor of Tallin in the
14th century Town Hall.
   There they were treated to classical music and a performance by
a soprano who Tabb said sounded as sweet as Loretta Lynn.
   ``A first, I'd say, for barbecue to blend itself with culture,
sophistication and classical music,'' Tabb reported in the
``Bullsheet,'' the official publication of the KCBS. ``Totally fun
and bizarre - sort of like taking a Weber or a 55-gallon drum to
the opera.
   ``Later, while toasting champagne around this centuries old long
table, an Estonian official whispered in my ear that the last time
Gorby was in Tallin, he sat exactly where I was standing. A shiver
ran down my spine.''
   Estonia is probably the farthest reach of the KCBS, although the
smoke from cookers goes up in Canada, Vienna, Bermuda and 40 U.S.
states. Back home, Wells said when you think of the center of
American barbecue, you can envision a triangle from Kansas City to
Memphis to Texas.
   To KCBS purists, Southern style barbecue doesn't count because
those folks only cook pork; real barbecuers cook beef, poultry and
lamb as well as pork. ``In Carolina, the sauce is clearer,'' Wells
said. ``They use vinegar and peppers. It's a mustard-based sauce.
As you go west, it gets redder and sweeter.''
   Oh, that's another thing. Never ask a cooker for the recipe to
his sauce. You'll be met with stony silence - if you're lucky.
   ``Barbecuing is the process of cooking meat slowly for a long
period of time,'' Wells said. ``You control your heat. Disseminate
enough smoke. Add moisture. But really, if it works for you, do
it.''
   A barbecue competition is judged two ways. Under Kansas City
rules, a group of judges are given blind samples. In Memphis, where
there is a prestigious competition in June, judges go from
barbecuer to barbecuer to taste samples.
   A typical competition goes like this: The cooking teams arrive
Friday and set up shop. At midnight, it's time to put the brisket
on. Then comes a night and day of cooking.
   Some teams split up the duties by having one person cook the
chicken while others do the brisket and ribs. Others have a chief
cook and people to tend the fire and run errands.
   Sometimes, significant prize money is involved - as much as
$10,000. But mainly, the aim is to have fun.
   ``You haven't lived until you've been on a field trip with 80
barbecuers,'' said Carolyn Wells, Gary's wife and a past editor of
the ``Bullsheet.'' ``It lets us be kids again. There's the
camaraderie.''
   Each year, dozens of Kansas City area members go out into the
cold to barbecue turkeys for the local Harvesters group. This past
Thanksgiving, they donated clothing and just under a ton of food.
   ``That is the spirit of barbecue,'' Wells said. ``They are just
plain good folks. They've got a heart of gold. They would do
backflips for you. They are generous in spirit.''

   There are many barbecue sauces under the sun; each has its
partisans.
   Jeanne Voltz, author of ``Barbecued Ribs, Smoked Butts and Other
Great Feeds'' (Knopf, $19.95), says her Texas barbecue sauce is
close to the Kansas City variety. The sauce - offered here with her
permission - is not used for cooking, but is served at the table
after dry-rubbed meat is barbecued.
   
   \ cup butter
   1 small onion, chopped
   1 clove garlic, minced
   3 ribs celery, finely chopped
   1 cup catsup
   { cup cider vinegar
   1{ cups water
   \ cup Worcestershire sauce
   3 bay leaves
   1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
   1 tablespoon chili powder, or to taste
   
   In a large stainless-steel or enamelware saucepan melt the
butter. Add onion, garlic and celery. Cook and stir until onion is
tender. Stir in catsup, vinegar, water and Worcestershire sauce.
Add bay leaves and pepper. Simmer uncovered 15 to 20 minutes,
stirring now and then to prevent sticking. Stir a small amount of
sauce into chili powder and blend well. Stir chili mixture into
sauce. Remove bay leaves. Let stand at room temperature one hour or
longer before serving. Leftover sauce can be refrigerated for
several days. Makes two cups.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Their former leaders are scattered, they are
bickering among themselves, and dramatic political upheavals around
the globe have overshadowed their cause. China's pro-democracy
activists are struggling to keep alive the spirit of Tiananmen
Square.

   China's pro-democracy movement, which seized the
hearts and attention of the world a year and a half ago at
Tiananmen Square, is faltering.
   Internal squabbling, China's re-establishment in the world
community and the international media's preoccupation with Eastern
Europe and the Persian Gulf have nudged democracy activists out of
the headlines. Public interest has waned.
   The most prominent student leaders of the massive protests that
engulfed Beijing now lead low-profile lives, far from the spotlight
that made them media stars and one of them a Nobel Peace Prize
nominee.
   Wu'er Kaixi, the eloquent but mercurial firebrand, has been
pumping gas near San Francisco. Chai Ling, whose impassioned
leadership in the protests' final days won her the Nobel
nomination, has left her husband, fellow student dissident leader
Feng Congde in Paris, and is quietly attending Princeton
University.
   Without them, the movement has lost much of its cachet.
   Wan Runnan, newly elected president of the Federation for a
Democratic China, concedes that public support has diminished.
   ``But there are bound to be periods of high and low interest,''
he said in an interview. ``No one can ignore a country that
represents one-fourth of the world's population.''
   The federation was born amid much fanfare in Paris in September
1989, two months after the bicentennial of the French Revolution.
The annual parade down the Champs Elysees was led by some 200
Chinese students on bicycles, momentarily giving Paris' most famous
street the look of a Beijing boulevard.
   Chinese soldiers backed by tanks charged down those Beijing
boulevards in the early morning of June 4, 1989, shooting and
killing at least several hundred unarmed protesters. The searing
images of the bloodshed were etched into the minds of millions who
watched the tragey unfold on television.
   Much of the protests' leadership fled overseas, as had - decades
before them - the influential political thinkers Kang Youwei and
his disciple Liang Qichao, and Sun Yat-sen, the founder of modern
China. All were active in Japan, preaching democracy for China
around the turn of the century.
   Exile abroad was also the lot of former Premier Zhou Enlai,
revered by the students at Tiananmen, and recently retired senior
leader Deng Xiaoping, despised by the democracy supporters as the
mastermind of the crackdown. They began their revolutionary careers
in France, where they joined the Communist Party in the early
1920s.
   The federation has kept its dream of Chinese democracy alive
through seminars, demonstrations and criticism of China's
authoritarian regime.
   Its founders include dissidents forced to leave China, such as
physicist Fang Lizhi, who hid in Beijing's U.S. Embassy for more
than a year before being allowed to leave, and outspoken Marxist
theoretician Su Shaozhi, who for years advocated thorough reform of
the Communist Party.
   It has maintained contacts in China and closely monitors what it
claims are continuing human rights abuses under China's communist
government.
   Recently it spearheaded denunciations of the trials of top
dissidents in China. The federation said the trials violated
China's constitution by holding the accused for 13 months without
trial and denying them defense lawyers of their choice.
   Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, who published a dissident magazine,
are accused of sedition, which carries a maximum penalty of death.
Wang Dan, the student seen as the behind-the-scenes brain of the
popular movement, stands accused of ``counterrevolutionary
incitement.''
   But the dissident movement in exile has lost the momentum that
used to attract large crowds - and donations - at its rallies and
fund-raisers.
   ``The formation of the FDC (the federation) came at a high tide
for the democracy movement,'' says Andrew Nathan, a professor at
Columbia University in New York and author of two books on Chinese
democracy.
   ``There were signs that the Chinese regime would collapse, and
the cream of the crop were organizing overseas. There were a lot of
expectations, but things didn't happen.''
   The federation is regrouping and seeking fresh directions under
Wan, elected at the group's annual convention in San Francisco. He
directs chapters in 20 countries - formed most recently in Brazil
and Greece - from a three-room office in a quiet section of
northwest Paris.
   He insists the group has been effective.
   ``Without an opposition faction, there will never be
democracy,'' he says. ``If the United States didn't have two
parties, if Poland hadn't had Solidarity, you couldn't have
democracy. There cannot be a rule that the Chinese Communist Party
must be in power.''

   His top priority is to persuade foreign governments to pressure
Beijing toward greater political liberalization and respect for
human rights. He is disappointed that the West has dropped most of
the economic and political sanctions imposed against China so soon
after the crackdown.
   ``We understand part of their reasons,'' he says. ``But as for
the conditions that brought on the sanctions in the first place -
the suppression, the arrests - there has been absolutely no
change.''
   Wan hopes to strengthen the movement through increased
cooperation with overseas Chinese and other opposition
organizations. But he faces criticism from rival dissident groups.
   ``Wan Runnan is short-sighted and an opportunist. He thinks that
just by eliminating the Communists' one-party rule you'll have
democracy in China,'' says Wang Xiaoyu, a former reporter for the
government news agency Xinhua who is now chief editor for the
dissident House of Chinese Democracy, also in Paris.
   ``The blood from June 4 hasn't yet dried, and he's setting up a
small clique of intellectuals who consider themselves the
government in exile. They make a lot of statements but don't do
anything constructive.''
   Wan, 46, believes he will see democracy in China within his
lifetime. But Wang says that is simplistic, and that ``it could
take 200, even 500 years.''
   Disagreements arise within the federation itself.
   On the eve of the San Francisco convention, a faction within the
federation criticized Wan. Their candidate to oppose Wan was
elected federation vice president.
   Wan is a former software engineer with the Chinese Academy of
Science's Computer Center who in 1984 was named head of the Stone
Corp., China's first private high-technology firm. A strong
supporter of the students at Tiananmen, he defected while visiting
Hong Kong four days after the crackdown when he learned an arrest
warrant had been issued for him.
   He took over as federation president from Yan Jiaqi, who as a
former adviser to ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang had
respectable credentials but was more theorist than organizer.
   Among Wan's tasks is addressing problems of the federation's
first year.
   ``The FDC hasn't been particularly effective in lobbying,''
Nathan says. ``Reaching out to the non-Chinese community is
something they've proved they're not very good at doing.''
   There was also the fiasco of the Goddess of Democracy, a ship
which was to broadcast pro-democracy messages into China but is now
a tourist attraction drawing mild interest in Taiwan. The mission
floundered when neither Japan nor Taiwan would allow the activists
to load a radio transmitter on board.
   The federation's finances reportedly have suffered, more from
bad administration than malfeasance. Of the $1 million the
federation received in its first year, it spent only 3 percent on
expanding democracy activities and 40 percent on travel or
consultations, according to the Chinese-language European Daily
News.
   When Chai Ling visited the United States this past summer she
raised $40,000, but spent virtually all of it paying for the trip,
according to a Chinese paper in the United States.
   Wan also has to make up for the departure from France of Chai
Ling and Wu'er Kaixi, whose youthful zeal made them strong media
draws.
   Yet Wu'er was a dubious asset to the organization because of
reports of his flamboyant lifestyle.
   ``Wu'er Kaixi ruined the FDC's reputation'' by spending too much
money on food and taxis, Wang says.
   Wu'er now works at a gas station near San Francisco and is
applying to attend the University of California at Berkeley.
``Things haven't been too tough for me over the past year,'' he
said during a recent trip to Taiwan. ``I thought it wouldn't hurt
to do something humble for awhile.''
   About Wu'er and Chai, Wan says, ``You can't base a political
movement on `stars.' Their departure is a maturing process, both
for them and for us.''
   Wan himself was exploring the possibility of returning to
Beijing, according to a U.S. diplomat. He left behind a wife and
college-student son. They were not arrested but cannot leave the
capital.
   Wan says only that he considered returning to China to continue
working for democratic reforms from within, but abandoned the idea.
Yet with limited ability in French and English, he admits thinking
often of home.
   ``People of that age, their lives revolve around China,'' Nathan
says. ``They've spent a lifetime achieving a stature that they will
never gain overseas. They now have an agonizing choice over what to
do with their lives.
   ``Sitting around drumming their fingers, living off of
fellowships - how long can this go on?''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Some Hollywood stars have become almost as
well-known for the causes they support as for the parts they play.
Jane Fonda, Charlton Heston and Edward Asner come immediately to
mind. While those three may represent an older generation, show
business today is not without its activists concerned about such
issues as the environment, energy, abortion and the homeless.

   Academy Awards night typically finds
Hollywood in a self-indulgent mood, the stars lavishing themselves
with fine clothes, finer praise and the finest food.
   Some, but not all.
   As the guests preened for last year's Oscar presentations,
actors Ron Silver, Susan Sarandon, Alec Baldwin, Christopher Reeve
and Jennifer Beales had more serious business at hand.
   They are members of an advocacy group called The Creative
Coalition and spent all day with New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and
state legislators, pushing environmental legislation and sounding
the alarm of global warming.
   In addition to The Creative Coalition, a growing group of
entertainment figures are cashiering their fame for good works,
performing at benefits and actually embracing causes as if their
careers - and sometimes their lives - depended on it.
   While the stereotype of the ineffectual celebrity do-gooder
persists, these performers, writers, directors and executives
endeavor to be both dedicated and knowledgeable.
   ``This is five days a week of two people working regular
hours,'' says Robert Foxworth, the former ``Falcon Crest'' star who
along with assistant Bobbi Murray produces a weekly issue-oriented
radio show with his own money.
   Ed Begley Jr. (``St. Elsewhere'') is one of Hollywood's most
dedicated activists, frequently sacrificing his time (and creature
comforts) for energy conservation.
   Living in a home illuminated by low-energy, 15-watt light bulbs
and commuting to work by bus, bicycle or electric car, Begley's
lifestyle strives to be as environmentally conscientious as
possible.
   In November, Begley was named chairman of an advisory committee
to the Southern California Rapid Transit District, which runs the
city's bus system and is building a massive subway network.
   ``Mr. Begley's commitment to public transit, as well as his
involvement in environmental issues, will provide strong
leadership,'' says RTD board President Nick Patsaouras.
   Most actors and actresses say when it comes to choosing between
their careers and their causes, employment comes first. Without
work, these activists have neither a platform nor money to pledge.
   What separates real activists from fair-weather warriors is the
level of sacrifice.
   Foxworth's ``American Dialogues'' program, for example, is
supported entirely by Foxworth's earnings and ``Falcon Crest''
savings.
   The 5-year-old show, heard in 75 cities, has Foxworth
interviewing experts in a spectrum of social issues, from the war
on drugs to campaign finances to Central American politics.
   ``It's always been a frustration to some extent that the work in
film, television and theater hasn't been able to be more focused on
issues,'' says Foxworth, sitting in a recording studio built over
his garage. ``We have our podium, our pedestal is to some extent
our career. It provides some access to people.''
   Silver, who was one of the founders of the non-partisan Creative
Coalition, says entertainers have a duty to charity.
   ``I think there's almost an obligation,'' says Silver, the
co-star of the film ``Reversal of Fortune.'' ``Many of us are very
well compensated for work which a lot of people would love to do.
And we also have a lot of leisure time in between jobs.
   ``The more visible members of our group use their access and
utilize their attention-getting abilities to bring a lot of issues
to the public's attention,'' Silver says.
   The 250 show business professionals in the New York-based group
lobby local and national politicians about issues such as the
environment, freedom of expression, abortion rights and the
homeless.
   ``They say that Hollywood is sex without substance, and
Washington politics is substance without sex, so maybe the marriage
of the two is mutually intriguing,'' Silver says.
   There are more than a few celebrities who have become almost as
well-known for the causes they support as for the parts they play.
   Jane Fonda's acting career has been tinged by her activism
during the Vietnam War when she appeared on Radio Hanoi and begged
American soldiers to stop bombing. To some she is as much ``Hanoi
Jane'' as she is the star of 1981's ``On Golden Pond'' or 1989's
``Stanley and Iris.''
   During filming of the latter in 1988, a Waterbury, Conn.,
veterans helped circulate bumper stickers that read, ``I'm Not
Fond'a Hanoi Jane.''
   ``I'm a good scapegoat,'' Miss Fonda said in an interview not
long ago. ``I can be painted into an image which causes a lot of
hostility. I may not be that person but that's irrelevant.''
   Charlton Heston (``Ben Hur'') donates time to the National Rifle
Association and lobbies against government funding for explicit
art. Mike Farrell (``M-A-S-H'') is recognized as one of the
nation' strongest voices for civil rights. Singer Jackson Browne,
whose concerts are loaded with plugs for causes, said that some
fans have taken to yelling, ``Just sing!''

   Ed Asner is so strongly associated with left-of-center issues
that he believes his politics contributed to the 1982 cancellation
of his ``Lou Grant'' series on CBS.
   Mary Tyler Moore, herself a diabetic, is the international
spokesperson for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. In the
non-paying position, Miss Moore makes speeches, appears in public
service announcements and travels to support the foundation.
   Candice Bergen has adopted several causes. An animal-rights
activist, she does not wear furs. And she dedicates her time to the
Starlight Foundation, which grants wishes to children dying from
cancer. She and her husband, director Louis Malle, hosted a benefit
screening of Malle's film ``Au Revoir Les Enfants'' for the
Starlight Foundation.
   Liza Minnelli is on the board of the Institute for the
Achievement of Human Potential, an organization that works with
mentally handicapped children and their families. Miss Minnelli
performs regularly at benefit concerts for the institute.
   Some labor for causes linked to their on-screen characters.
Richard Dysart, who stars as senior partner Leland McKenzie on
``L.A. Law,'' has made two public service announcements advocating
equal protection.
   Roy Scheider (``Jaws''), who appeared in Home Box Office's
death-row drama ``Somebody Has to Shoot the Picture,'' hosted an
anti-death penalty screening of the film. ``It's a barbaric custom
and it doesn't work,'' Scheider says.
   The compact disc for rock star Phil Collins' new album ``Serious
Hits...Live'' is packaged in recycled cardboard. It bears the
message, ``Car pool when possible. Tune up your car regularly and
keep your tires inflated to the recommended pressure. These steps
will conserve energy and reduce air pollution.''
   Not bad. But musicians Peter Gabriel and Raffi are insisting
that their CDs be issued in no cardboard packaging at all, saving
even more trees.
   Rock star Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders is an activist for
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. She spent one recent
morning disrupting hunters as they stalked game in a Maryland corn
field. The animal-rights group, whose other celebrity members
include k.d. Lang, River Phoenix and Jane Wiedlin, opposes hunting,
the fur industry and using animals for laboratory testing.
   Even sincere Hollywood activists dance in dangerous territory.
The preposterous TV advertising line, ``I'm not a doctor, but I
play one on television,'' still points up the basic ambiguity of
celebrity endorsements: Just because somebody's on camera, why
should we think they know anything?
   When Miss Sarandon (``White Palace'') made a campaign appearance
for New Jersey Gov. James Florio, a heckler shouted, ``Go back to
Hollywood!''
   In one recent debacle, Angela Lansbury of CBS' ``Murder, She
Wrote'' was induced to appear in commercials opposing a pair of
California initiatives that would limit elective office terms.
   Miss Lansbury's commercials, which failed a state requirement to
identify their sponsors, were later proved inaccurate. The actress'
son (and agent) conceded that his mother was misinformed. ``She
doesn't really read newspapers,'' said son David Shaw.
   Foxworth, on the other hand, reads - newspapers included.
Despite the heckling of Miss Sarandon, Silver says his coalition
tries to protect its members from ridicule.
   ``What we insist upon in The Creative Coalition - and I think it
makes us a little different from a couple of other groups - is that
we're very concerned about informing ourselves and articulating the
issues so that when we go out, we really know what we're talking
about,'' Silver says.
   Comic Relief is an annual comedy concert held in Los Angeles to
raise money for the homeless. Yet principal participants Robin
Williams, Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg are more than hosts for
the show, says Comic Relief founder and President Bob Zmuda.
   ``They've taken on Comic Relief as their main charity,'' Zmuda
says. ``They write the show, they promote the show and they spend a
lot of time visiting homeless shelters.''
   A number of serious activists say there will always be some
people who join a cause not to bring peace to El Salvador or fight
poverty in the inner city, but to meet people and get jobs.
   ``A lot of people pretend to be involved when they're not,''
says actress Alexandra Paul (``Dragnet,'' ``American Flyer''), a
co-founder of the service organization Young Artists United. Most
of YAU's 400 members are devoted, she says, but there may be
up-and-coming entertainers who believe their careers will take off
if they increase their volunteer work.
   ``But if that really worked, many of my friends in YAU would be
superstars by now, including myself,'' Miss Paul says.
   Daniel Sladek, who in addition to his frantic job as a
television production executive, spends more than 10 hours a week
running YAU, which he co-founded with Miss Paul.
   YAU's members - including Sarah Jessica Parker (``Equal
Justice'') and Robert Downey Jr. (``1969'') - educate themselves
about topical subjects so that they can infuse their future work
with more sensitivity.
   In addition to occasionally painting shelters for runaway kids
or serving meals on Skid Row, YAU members speak candidly to
students and young people about drug abuse, sexuality and suicide.
   Miss Paul talks about her own eating disorders.
   ``We only talk from our own personal experience,'' she says.
``When I talk about throwing up, they forget that I was in a film
with Tom Hanks or Jeff Bridges.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - For more than three decades before it closed,
the Cotter Corp. mill in Colorado processed uranium for nuclear
power plants. It has been cited nearly 100 times by both state and
federal officials for allegedly polluting the mill site and the
surrounding area. Now residents of one neighborhood near the mill
have gone to court with a $550 million lawsuit.

<TEXT>
   Sitting in the calico-covered swing on
their back porch, watching their horse trot around her pen near the
red barn, Nard and Sara Claar seem to be living the American dream.
   Fruit trees and flowers cover their acre of land, and not far
away are the Rocky Mountains' cold streams and deep forests.
   Sara, 38, grew up here in the Lincoln Park subdivision on the
edge of Canon City, a city of 13,000 in southern Colorado. She and
Nard, 40, never gave much thought to the Cotter Corp. uranium mill
less than two miles from their home.
   Cotter was considered a solid citizen. Next to the state prison
system and its half-dozen facilities, the mill was Canon City's
largest employer. In its heyday, the mill, owned by Chicago-based
Commonwealth Edison, employed 250 people and processed 1,200 tons
of rock a day.
   That was before Sarah became ill and 13 people on their block
were diagnosed as having cancer or had died of it.
   Now the Claars and many of the nearly 400 people who live in
Lincoln Park think their neighborhood has been contaminated by
Cotter's uranium processing.
   ``We just thought this was a natural occurrence. Everybody knew
somebody who died of cancer,'' says Sara, who only recently became
able to work around her home after being bedridden 18 months with
immune deficiency problems. Four members of her family have cancer.
   But now the Claars and their neighbors believe Cotter - whose
mill here is listed as a Superfund cleanup site by the
Environmental Protection Agency - is the culprit. They note that in
its 32 years the Cotter mill has been cited nearly 100 times by
both state and federal officials for allegedly polluting the mill
site and surrounding areas.
   The uranium mill has been closed since 1987 because its product
- uranium concentrate called ``yellowcake'' for nuclear power
plants - is no longer in demand. No date has been set for
operations to resume.
   The mill crushed, ground and leached uranium with acid to
convert it to yellowcake, dumping the leftovers into piles next to
the mill or in ponds used to control dust. Cotter operated one mill
at the site from 1958 to 1979, then opened a newer, bigger one
nearby because of growing demand for their product.
   The mill site also wound up as the repository of 250 kilograms
of radioactive leftovers from the first atomic bomb, called the
``St. Louis Airport Cakes'' because that's where the tailings were
stored initially. Cotter purchased the cakes in 1968 and shipped
the radioactive residue - which contained the rare cancer-causing
radioactive isotope thorium-230 - to Canon City in open railroad
cars.
   Cotter processed nearly two-thirds of the cakes to extract their
uranium, copper, cobalt and nickel. The leftovers were dumped into
a lined holding pond at the mill.
   A 1986 state report said there were holes in the pond lining
that allowed contaminated water to leach into the ground water.
   Cotter's image as a model corporate citizen began to erode when
traces of radioactive uranium began showing up in well water in
Lincoln Park. Apparently water contaminated with the uranium had
seeped into the ground water beneath the mill and then had migrated
to Lincoln Park. Airborne uranium dust added to the problem.
   About the time Cotter was eyeing a bigger operation to take
advantage of rising uranium prices, regulators were starting to
take a closer look at Cotter's pollution problems.
   The Colorado Bureau of Investigation cited Cotter in 1980 for
repeatedly overexposing its workers to uranium dust and for
falsifying occupational health data in reports to the state health
department. The same year, the health department accused Cotter of
23 violations of its state radioactive materials license.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission in January 1981 recommended
that several Lincoln Park residents stop using well water for
irrigation and their livestock because of possible contamination
from the Cotter mill.
   In March 1986, a study commissioned by the state and done by
GeoTrans-Rocky Mountain Consultants Inc. found that mining and
milling activities at Cotter had seriously contaminated the
surrounding area.
   In August 1988, the state sent a letter to Fremont County
officials saying Lincoln Park residents face a potential health
risk because of contamination from the Cotter mill.

   Cotter today is cleaning up the mill site as part of an $11
million environmental damage settlement reached in 1988 with the
state of Colorado.
   Phil Stoffey, the on-site cleanup coordinator for the state
health department's Radiation Control Division, estimates it will
take Cotter 20 years to clean up the site under the remedial action
plan.
   The company also faces a major lawsuit filed by Lincoln Park
residents. In August 1989, their anger over what they believe is a
high cancer rate and over Cotter's pollution problems spilled over
into a $550 million lawsuit filed in federal court in Denver. The
lawsuit claims uranium waste from the mill polluted the ground
water and was carried on the wind, causing damage to residents'
health and property.
   Nard Claar thinks Cotter was given too much leeway in how much
uranium waste it could discharge into the air - 30 tons per year.
   ``What happens to that? It blows over my house and my neighbor's
house,'' he says. ``To my knowledge, the Cotter Corp. didn't use us
as guinea pigs. But with 30 tons of uranium being allowed, there
was a radioactive cloud over this valley.''
   The state cancer register does not show an above-average
incidence of the disease among Fremont County residents, and the
state does not keep data on individual cities or neighborhoods.
   State health officials say it is difficult to assess the cancer
risk from exposure to Cotter's uranium mill wastes.
   ``It's long-range and low-level,'' says Ken Weaver of the
Radiation Control Division. ``We're not talking about the kind of
radioactivity ... where spending a few hours or days in front of
the uranium pile will cause cancer. It's the long-range, long-term
effects on health.''
   A 1981 federal study found evidence of kidney damage in 29 men
who worked at Cotter. And a 1987 attorney general's report said
Lincoln Park residents are ``receptors at risk'' if they drink
contaminated water, eat food irrigated with contaminated water or
grown in contaminated soil, or inhale dust or radon from mill
sources.
   The state in 1988 issued a warning that said Lincoln Park
residents face a potential health risk by drinking water
contaminated by the mill. Many Lincoln Park residents got their
water from wells whose water later was found to be contaminated
with uranium and molybdenum, a byproduct of uranium processing.
   While Lincoln Park residents press their concerns in court,
opinion is more divided among other Canon City residents.
   ``Everybody living in Fremont County is not cowering and
concerned that they will get cancer,'' says Pat Sherwood, executive
director of the Canon City Chamber of Commerce. She says the media
have implied that the entire community is concerned about becoming
ill, ``and it's just not true.''
   Jack Rothfleisch, the Cotter mill manager who is supervising the
site cleanup, does not think the cancer rate is any higher in
Lincoln Park than anyplace else.
   ``I think those people would have cancer if they were in the
middle of Nebraska, too,'' he says. ``As far as I'm concerned, I
don't think anybody has been harmed in any way by the exposure to
what we've done out here.''
   Cotter officials would not discuss the lawsuit, but they were
willing to speak about the company's special relationship with
Canon City.
   ``The relationship of the Cotter Corp. with the community has
been a close, enduring one in which the company and the community
have shared in some good times and some bad times,'' says Joe
McCluskey, Cotter vice president and general manager of the
company's Lakewood office.
   ``The company and its employees have always appreciated the
support of the community, and, likewise, the community has enjoyed
the support of the Cotter Corp. over many years.''
   Meanwhile, Sara Claar is seeking treatment in Denver for her
undiagnosed illness. Nard and Sara say one of their greatest
frustrations is not knowing what they face.
   ``I cannot say that Cotter made me sick,'' Mrs. Claar says.
``But I'd like to know what did. We've never been able to get a
definite answer. Now, at least they're testing.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - There is a fascination for some, usually the
doers of crossword puzzles and fans of Trivial Pursuit, in trifling
information. Here is a book of facts great and small, distilled
from millions of questions asked of the New York Public Library by
people who can't take ``don't know'' for an answer.

   In 1857, Elisha G. Otis invented the passenger
elevator. Fifteen years after that William LeBaron Jenny designed
the first skyscraper, a 10-story structure.
   Naturally, someone had to invent the elevator before someone
could build a skyscraper, but the same year that gave us the
skyscraper gave us the commercial electric fan. Cool.
   If these seemingly distended historical tidbits attract you,
then leaf through the New York Public Library's Desk Reference, a
book full of surprises. It is based on the more than 5 million
questions the library and its 82 branches answer each year.
   Vartan Gregorian, former president and chief executive officer
of the library, writes in his preface, ``...unlike annuals and
almanacs that need revising and updating each year, the Desk
Reference (Stonesong Press, $34.95) holds a considerable amount of
true reference information, unchanging basic facts and background.
   ``We also hope that our book will be easy to read and fun to
browse through.''
   It is.
   For instance, if you know that Thomas Alva Edison invented the
phonograph in 1878, you will be pleased to know that L.O. Colvin
invented the milking machine the same year, and James J. Ritty
invented the cash register the year after that.
   These were heady times, a veritable cascade of brainstorms. But
read further. Every year was like that.
   For instance, last year was the 110th birthday of the hearing
aid, and the 120th for linoleum and the snap button. It was also
the 100th anniversary of motion pictures and the electric subway.
It was the 90th anniversary of the paper clip.
   This year is the 100th birthday of the flashlight (by England's
Bristol Electric Lamp Co.), the aluminum boat (by Switzerland's
Escher Wyss &amp; Co.) and the zipper (by Whitcombe L. Judson). So much
for the snap button.
   The Desk Reference has less esoteric fare. It tells you how to
write your congressman, how to call toll-free for rental cars and
hotels. There are 15 pages of visa requirements to travel anywhere
from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe.
   There is an illustrated section on the human anatomy and how to
play board games from backgammon to Scrabble or cards from
blackjack to solitaire.
   There is simply no way to list all of the tidy bits of
information from dietary tables to musical terms and symbols, from
extinct animals to semaphore, from etiquette to legal forms, from
animal first aid to a directory of poison control centers.
   More than an almanac or a book of world records, it is a settler
of arguments. Take religion. The book says there are 648 million
Hindus, 18 million Jews, 840 million Muslims, 158 million Orthodox
Catholics, 307 million Buddhists, and 5.6 million followers of
Confucius.
   In the United States, there are 31 million Baptists, 2.7 million
Episcopalians, 13.5 million Methodists, 2.8 million Mormons, 8
million Lutherans, 700,000 Jehovah's Witnesses.
   But worldwide there are 900 million Roman Catholics, the largest
Christian Church in the world. It takes 6{ pages to list all the
popes.
   It takes only a line to inform you that Mary Phelps Jacob
invented the brassiere in 1914.
   One thing that strikes the reader is how long ago some of the
inventions sprang from the human mind. Another is, what in the
world did mankind do before they came along?
   A third is that, with so many minds at work, progress is
inevitable.
   We were blessed with the screwdriver and wrench about 1550 by
unknown gunsmiths.
   We got eyeglasses from Alessandro de Spina in 1285 and lip
reading from Alexander Melville Bell in 1866 and the telephone from
Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 and the hearing aid from R.G. Rhodes
four years later.
   In 1855, we got the stopwatch from Edward Daniel Johnson, 345
years after Peter Henlein gave us the pocket watch.
   In 1862, we got the machine gun from Richard Jordan Gatling and
a year later TNT from J. Wilbrand. In 1867, Alfred Nobel gave us
dynamite a dozen years after we got the safety match to light it.
In 1867, we also got barbed wire from Lucien Smith.
   Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier gave us the hot
air balloon in 1783, 14 years before Andre Jacques Garnerin came up
with the parachute. What balloonists did in the interim is not
explained.
   The metal cannon was introduced in 1326 by Rinaldo di
Villamagna, the spirally grooved rifle barrel in 1520 by August
Kotter, the portable shotgun in 1525 by the Marquis of Pescara.
   It was not until 1540 that Ambrose Pare invented artificial
limbs. That was offset the same year by Camillo Vettelli who
invented the pistol.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Not all park rangers roam the wilds, keeping a
lookout for forest fires and wayward bears. At Independence Hall in
Philadelphia the rangers of the National Park Service are more like
classroom teachers than caretakers of nature, and they'd better
know their history.

   National Park Service rangers at
Independence Hall still remember the woman who insisted on seeing
the Statue of Liberty.
   ``People really do think of Philadelphia as the Cradle of
Liberty, and some visitors think it's all here,'' says ranger Larry
McClennie. ``This lady insisted that the statue was here somewhere.
She wanted directions to find it, and `Go 100 miles north and turn
right' wasn't what she wanted.''
   Even if the No. 1 question is ``Where's the bathroom?'' the
rangers who show off the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall need to
be ready to answer all kinds of questions from some 1.4 million
visitors a year.
   ``I probably learned more history here than I ever could have
imagined,'' says Scott Dawson, who's worked two seasonal stints at
the park.
   A question that comes up a lot is how the bell cracked, after it
rang for years in the Statehouse tower to announce important events
such as the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
   ``Cracks in bells were fairly common in those days,'' McClennie
explains. ``They were repaired and put back in service, as the
Liberty Bell was. But it cracked again and wasn't used after
that.''
   The park, which encompasses nearly two dozen buildings that
figured in the birth of the United States as a nation, has a guide
staff of 40 rangers - 70 in the peak months from April through
September.
   Would-be rangers go through a week of intensive training,
according to Barbara Pollarine, director of interpretation. They
learn about three themes - the American Revolution, Benjamin
Franklin and Philadelphia as the national capital.
   After a day of lectures and exercises, the ranger-students
tackle a long reading list.
   There are standard texts such as ``Miracle at Philadelphia,'' by
Catherine Drinker Bowen. Another is ``The Liberty Bell; the
Venerable Relic,'' by former park historian Dave Kimball.
   Rangers are also encouraged to do research in the libraries of
the Pennsylvania Historical Society, the American Philosophical
Society and the park itself, resources not available anywhere else.
   By the end of their first week, each new ranger is expected to
deliver a brief presentation prepared for the public.
   The trainees learn the basic history of the buildings, but when
they speak to the public as rangers, they add their own flair to
the presentation to make it interesting to the visitors, says David
Dutcher, chief historian of the park.
   When Dawson leads a tour of Independence Hall, he explains that
so much of the interior is green because it was the cheapest dye in
the 18th century.
   Then he points out his uniform - green - and wonders whether the
government is still as ``cheap'' as it used to be.
   Other rangers tell of the haunted second floor of Congress Hall.
The ghost of French Queen Marie Antoinette supposedly lurks there.
   No one knows how the story got started. But King Louis XVI of
France did donate a painting of his wife to Congress and the
painting was lost in the move to Washington. A reproduction of the
painting now hangs in Congress Hall in Philadelphia.
   As popular as this park is with the public - it's the biggest
tourist attraction in Pennsylvania - many rangers consider it only
an entry-level job. Unlike in many other big organizations, the
staff yearns for transfers out of the big city to the boondocks.
   ``The kind of person who wants to work for the National Park
Service doesn't exactly envision working in downtown
Philadelphia,'' Pollarine says. ``After a year here, many of them
are looking for someplace else to work.''
   ``Rangers are just like other people,'' says ranger Steve
Perlman. ``When they think of the national parks, they think of
Yellowstone.''
   Besides hearing the call of the wild, park rangers here have to
deal with the cost of living in the city. A starting park ranger's
salary is about $17,000 a year.
   While many park service trainees come out of college, an
increasing number are retired from teaching or military service.
   ``A lot of people you meet here are academically very well
trained,'' Pollarine says.
   Philadelphia ranks as a good place for rangers to prove
themselves. On busy days, tours are given every 15 minutes at
Independence Hall with 85 people going through the building at a
time, Dutcher says.
   ``On the average day, we get about 2,000 to 3,000 people,'' says
ranger Bill Kashatus. On peak days in May, it's not unusual for
8,000 schoolchildren to visit the Liberty Bell.
   The training continues after the rangers go on duty. Every other
week, the park has a 45-minute session focusing on a special topic.
   Because the Bill of Rights will be a hot topic in 1991, its
bicentennial year, the rangers will soon hear a speaker on James
Madison, who drafted the documents.
   ``We never feel that we have all the information that we need,''
McClennie says. ``It's a never-ending course of study.''
   The rewards may not be tangible, but they are here.
   ``Not to be corny about it, but this is a very special place,''
Pollarine says. ``It's very important to a lot of people. I've seen
people cry during tours.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Here's an eagle whose picture could be on a
postage stamp as a proud symbol of America. But this one went bad.
Born in captivity and then released in the wild, he started doing
things eagles are not supposed to do, raiding barnyards. But in the
land of the free he'll get a second chance.

   A young bald eagle that turned chicken
thief after he was released in the wild is back in the slammer.
   State ornithologist Jim D. Wilson has recommended a short stay
behind bars for the wayward eagle, but plans to give him a second
chance at freedom.
   The eagle, nicknamed ``E,'' was released at the Schell-Osage
Wildlife Area in west-central Missouri in July as part of a
Department of Conservation program to re-establish a breeding
population of eagles in the state.
   Seventy-four young bald eagles were raised in artificial nests
with only minimal human contact and released into the wilds of
Missouri under a 10-year program which just ended.
   ``E,'' which came from a wild nest in Wisconsin, began doing
un-eaglelike things after he or she - it's difficult to determine
the sex of an eagle - arrived in Missouri.
   Although most eagles shy away from humans, ``E'' didn't mind at
all that a Daviess County farm family was watching in amazement as
he repeatedly killed and ate their tame ducks.
   Wildlife officials thought the bird had only momentarily
deviated from its normal diet, consisting mainly of rodents. So
they recaptured the eagle and released it again about 75 miles away
at the Squaw Creek Wildlife Refuge in northwestern Missouri.
   However, ``E'' turned up in late August in southern Iowa, eating
dead baby pigs at another farm. The young eagle was captured again
and returned to Squaw Creek, only to be caught red-handed a few
days later eating a chicken in a farmer's chicken house in Atchison
County.
   This time ``E'' was rounded up and transferred to the Dickerson
Park Zoo in Springfield, which specializes in the care of injured
eagles and other birds of prey.
   Bald eagles winter around major lakes and rivers in Missouri by
the hundreds, and Wilson plans to release ``E'' near his cousins in
February in hopes he will learn proper eagle behavior.
   ``What apparently happened to this bird is it somehow found out
that farmyards were a place you could find some easy pickins,''
Wilson says.
   ``I'd like to give it one more try. I'll release it with another
flock of eagles at a wildlife area where it won't come in contact
with humans very easily and where there is an abundant natural food
supply.
   ``If it doesn't adapt to the wild, it will be a zoo bird. I
don't really want that; nobody does. There are plenty of zoo
eagles.''
   Of the 74 eagles the conservation department has released in the
state, only one other bird behaved in a similar fashion, Wilson
says. That eagle ended up getting killed by a truck in Kansas while
eating an animal killed in the road, which is also uncharacteristic
of eagles.
   Overall, the conservation department's efforts to get eagles to
nest again in Missouri are showing signs of paying off, Wilson
says. Three pairs nested successfully near the Mingo National
Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Missouri this year, and another
pair nested at an undisclosed location in central Missouri.
   The eagles are equipped with colored wing tags. More than 40 of
the eagles released at the Mingo and Schell-Osage wildlife areas
have been observed in surrounding states and as far away as Texas
and Colorado.
   It takes about five years before eagles are mature and ready to
nest.
   ``They are similar to salmon in that they should return to where
they were raised to raise their own young,'' Wilson says.
   Eagles began disappearing in the state as large numbers of
settlers moved in around the turn of the century.
   Ironically, habitat may be better for eagles in Missouri now
than ever before.
   ``For one thing, the eagle is now protected by law and people
know it so there's less disturbance of them,'' Wilson says. ``In
addition, eagles are water birds and like our abundant
reservoirs.''

   In the TV series ``Dark Shadows,''
producer-director Dan Curtis faced the problem of how to make a
vampire a romantic figure.
   How do you do that? Well, he made his character, Barnabas
Collins, a reluctant vampire, one who's trying to kick the habit.
   This vampire is no Dracula, nor is he a Stephen King or Anne
Rice ghoul.
   ``Barnabas is a classic romantic figure who is seeking the lost
love from 200 years ago that he can never regain,'' Curtis says.
``He hates his existence as a vampire, which is a spell put upon
him by a witch. He's a great, dark, brooding, romantic figure.''
   A revival of ``Dark Shadows,'' which became a Gothic cult soap
opera in the 1960s, begins with a four-hour, two-part miniseries
Sunday and Monday on NBC. On Friday it begins as a one-hour series
following ``Quantum Leap.''
   It's Curtis' first project since ``The Winds of War'' and ``War
and Remembrance.''
   ``I can't tell you exactly what made it work,'' Curtis says. ``I
can tell you what the show is as opposed to what people think it
is. It's not horror. It's a romantic fantasy. I think what makes it
work are the mythical elements.''
   Curtis gleefully concedes that ``Dark Shadows,'' an ABC
afternoon soap opera from 1966-71, was inspired by ``Wuthering
Heights,'' ``Jane Eyre,'' ``Rebecca'' and other Gothic stories.
   In the beginning ``Dark Shadows'' was merely Gothic - and about
to get the ax from ABC.
   ``We were about to go off the air when my kids suggested I make
it scary,'' he says. ``I introduced a ghost into the show, and the
moment the ghost appeared on the screen the ratings went up.
Instantly. I then came up with a supernatural story and the ratings
went even higher. I decided to see how far I could go.
   ``I figured if I could get away with a vampire I could get away
with anything. I was planning to kill him off, but Barnabas caught
on. He was a sensation. The question was how to make a hero out of
a vampire. So we made him a reluctant vampire. That was it.''
   In the new version of ``Dark Shadows,'' Barnabas Collins is
played by Ben Cross. Jean Simmons is the matriarch of Collinwood,
an isolated New England manor house. Joanna Going is the beautiful
young governess, a reincarnation of Barnabas' 200-year-old love,
and Barbara Steele is a doctor who tries to cure Barnabas and falls
in love with him.
   Curtis says the story is virtually the same as it was 25 years
ago, but there are substantial changes in the production values.
   ``Many people have a memory of the show,'' he says. ``I'm not
making the show the way it was but the way they remember it. It was
a half-hour before. Our budget for five shows a week was about
$90,000. We're spending around $1.2 million a show today.
   ``People have an exaggerated memory of the show. I'm sure they
thought the great hall at Collinwood was a great hall. It was a
very, very small hall. The new great hall is enormous. We filmed a
lot of it at the Greystone mansion in Beverly Hills.''
   Curtis was not eager to return to ``Dark Shadows,'' but NBC
began pursuing him while he was still working on ``War and
Remembrance.''
   ``I didn't choose to go back,'' he says. ``NBC came to me. I'm
getting some laughs out of it, but it's not like it's close to my
heart and I bring all my emotions to it. I can't believe I'm doing
this. When I was doing the original show I would have killed to get
out of it. It was like I was in jail.''
   Curtis spent the 1980s on the two monumental miniseries based on
Herman Wouk's books about World War II. Before that he was best
known for horror films such as ``The Night Stalker,'' ``Dracula,''
``The Turn of the Screw,'' ``Frankenstein,'' ``The Picture of
Dorian Gray'' and ``Burnt Offerings.''
   Currently in the works are a third ``Night Stalker'' movie and a
third movie about his childhood remembrances. Dean Jones, who
played a character based on Curtis' father in ``When Every Day Was
the Fourth of July'' and ``The Long Days of Summer,'' will star in
the new film. Curtis is also writing several feature movies.
   ``It's been tough adjusting after so much time on the two
miniseries,'' he says. ``I'd like to go back to `War and
Remembrance.' I'd like to be ready to board a plane tomorrow.''

   Onstage in ``Buddy'' on Broadway, Paul Hipp
looks like the earnest young rock 'n' roller he portrays, Buddy
Holly. Offstage, he comes across more like the brashly flippant,
facetious early Beatles.
   In his Manhattan apartment, which he shares with a West Highland
terrier named Dylan, he ignores a visitor who walks in while he's
listening intently to a Stevie Ray Vaughan record.
   Then he looks up to say, incongruously, ``I'm obsessed with Van
Gogh. I like Vincent. I was fantasizing about cutting my ear off
the other day but it'd take longer to do the makeup. Now all I have
to do is put base on and eyeliner.''
   Hipp, 25, who has a rock band of his own, was born six years
after Buddy Holly died at age 22 and seven years before Don McLean
wrote ``American Pie'' about the plane crash that killed him.
   But he identifies with Holly ``in the way he stuck with his own
sound and his own music. And he was a nice guy.''
   Hipp took up guitar at 12 and has studied both music and acting.
Until ``Buddy,'' he hasn't been famous, though he'd like to be,
with parallel careers. ``I see no reason why it has got to be actor
or musician,'' he says. ``I came up doing both. It's not like I'm a
rock 'n' roller slumming on Broadway.
   ``One of my main things I want to do is bridge the gap that
hasn't been bridged yet and have a serious career songwriting and
acting. Sting hasn't done it or David Bowie. Kris Kristofferson is
more country music.''
   Paul Hipp and the Heroes haven't cut any records yet, but he's
talking to record companies now. His acting in New York previously
hasn't been Broadway or off-Broadway but ``off-off-off-off.''
   ``I did a lot of plays nobody came to see,'' he says. ``This is
a nice change of pace for me. It's a wonderful thing to look out
and there's people sitting out there.''
   People in the Shubert Theater mezzanine and balcony are warned
that dancing and standing during the performance are prohibited,
but Hipp can see them dancing in the orchestra section's first few
rows.
   ``If there's a pretty girl up front, I can throw her a guitar
pick,'' he says. ``Then I have the crew go get her. When I come off
stage, the dressing room is filled with a bevy of beauties. The
next stop is the hot tub.''
   Despite the fact that he's starring in a musical, Hipp says, ``I
hate musicals. All that show business, people dancing, ain't my
thing.''
   Hipp's 20th-floor apartment on Central Park South is his first
New York apartment, he says. ``For nine years I couldn't afford
one. I lived wherever there was a couch. That's how Buddy Holly has
changed my life.''
   When he auditioned for ``Buddy'' in England, where he played the
role for nine months, he thinks he was chosen primarily for his
acting ability. ``But I'm sure the fact I can play guitar didn't
hurt.''
   Hipp was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award, which was won
by Jonathan Pryce in ``Miss Saigon.'' ``I thought it was fixed,''
he says. ``I don't know. It is fine to be nominated. It beats
playing Bleeker Street (in Greenwich Village) for 50 bucks a
night.''
   In ``Buddy,'' Hipp plays guitar and sings more than 20 Buddy
Holly songs, including ``That'll Be the Day,'' ``Peggy Sue'' and
``Oh Boy!''. He did a lot of research on the innovative pioneer
rocker from Lubbock, Texas, before he began portraying him.
   ``The show covers him from 19 to 22,'' Hipp says. ``He had the
natural growth any kid goes through. Add rock 'n' roll stardom, it
gets quite complicated. To internalize what had happened to him,
maintain that innocence and grow gradually was difficult.
   ``I met a lot of people who saw him on his last tour. Bob Dylan
saw him three days before he died, when he went through
Minnesota.''
   Act 2 of ``Buddy'' re-creates Buddy Holly's last concert, in
Clear Lake, Iowa, with Dion and the Belmonts, the Big Bopper and
Ritchie Valens. The latter two died on the plane with Holly later
that night.
   ``I wouldn't imagine anyone taped that show,'' Hipp says. ``I
would have run into them by now. The Buddy Holly Society knows more
about the Crickets (Holly's band) than the Crickets know about
themselves.''
   Holly's widow, who had a miscarriage after his death, saw
``Buddy'' in London and has been supportive, Hipp says.
   Hipp is the fourth of five children and uses his real name. He
moved to New York from Philadelphia right after graduating from
high school. ``The bell rang. I was here.
   ``I thought about changing my name to Rock Dashing,'' he says.
``I want to work on a soap opera really bad. I want to be Dr.
Dashing, have my teeth capped, plastic surgery, a square jaw, blond
hair and blue contacts.''
   Hipp played a Lower East Side punk in ``China Girl.'' During the
filming, he wrote the song ``Midnight for You.'' ``The director
liked it and put it in,'' Hipp says. Hipp and the Heroes played it.
   During the interview, Hipp strums on his guitar, which is
autographed by Johnny and June Cash, Duane Eddy, two Crickets and
Mrs. Holly.
   After ``Buddy'' and after his band cuts a record, Hipp hopes to
make a movie.
   ``It won't be music,'' he says. ``There won't be a guitar in
sight.''

   One by one, Diana Lumbrera buried each of
her six children, weeping and fainting as the tiny bodies were
lowered into the ground, begging on her knees for her little ones
to come back.
   Each of the children died before his or her fifth birthday, and
doctors ascribed each death to natural causes. Diana Lumbrera knew
better than that; she had been cursed by her former mother-in-law,
she said.
   But now, authorities say the children's deaths were neither
natural nor supernatural. They say that Diana Lumbrera, 32, killed
her kids.
   She has been convicted of killing one 4-year-old son; she faces
charges that she killed three daughters, a son and the daughter of
a cousin; authorities are investigating the death of another son.
   Still, her friends and family insist that a terrible mistake is
being made.
   ``She was a loving mother and she took care of those children,''
said her aunt, Elodia Flores. ``She worked hard every day and made
those children number one in her life. I just don't believe she
killed those children.''
   ---
   Joanna Garza, age 3 months, died Nov. 30, 1976. The cause of
death: ``strangulation due to asphyxiation due to convulsive
disorder.''
   Jose Lionel Garza, 2{ months, died Feb. 13, 1978. The cause of
death is listed as undetermined.
   Melissa Garza, 3, died Oct. 2, 1978, The cause: ``asphyxia due
to aspiration of stomach contents.''
   Erica Aleman, Ms. Lumbrera's 6-week-old cousin, died Oct. 8,
1980. Medical records are missing.
   Melinda Ann Garza, 2, died Aug. 17, 1982. The cause is listed as
``heart failure due to increased taxation on a case of congenital
heart disease.''
   Christopher Daniel Lumbrera, 5{ months, died March 28, 1984 of
what doctors said was septicemia - a fatal infection of the blood.
   Jose Antonio Lumbrera, 4, died May 1, 1990. The cause of death
was listed as ``asphyxia due to smothering.''
   ---
   For 14 years, as Ms. Lumbrera's children died one after another,
law enforcement authorities in Texas suspected nothing. The death
certificates gave them no reason to be suspicious.
   Then authorities in Garden City, Kans., where Ms. Lumbrera had
moved, were handed a murder case. Doctors there attributed Jose
Antonio's death to smothering, and a jury agreed in October, taking
just 3 hours to convict Ms. Lumbrera of murder. She was sentenced
to life in prison.
   The Kansas charges prompted a massive investigation into the
other deaths, resulting in the five murder indictments in three
West Texas counties.
   ``A death certificate may say death due to heart failure.
Everyone who dies suffers from heart failure,'' said Parmer County
District Attorney Johnny Actkinson, who will prosecute Ms. Lumbrera
in an upcoming trial.
   ``The question is, what caused the heart failure?''
   Actkinson says there was no coverup; instead, he suggested that
those who issued the death reports probably did not want to think
the worst.
   ``Those kids' deaths were such a horrible state of affairs that
no one considered a mother would murder her own children. So the
doctors look for another way to explain it. I am not being
critical. It's just human nature.''
   Lionel Garza, Ms. Lumbrera's second husband and father of four
of the dead children, says he was shocked by her conviction in Jose
Antonio's death.
   ``All my life I lived thinking my kids died of natural causes.
Now all the doors of question are open and the pain is rushing back
in,'' he said.
   Still, Garza - who filed for divorce from Ms. Lumbrera in 1980,
two years after their third child's death - apparently harbored
suspicions about his wife, according to authorities acquainted with
his grand jury testimony.
   ``Lionel was suspicious of Diana after the third death,'' said
Bovina Police Chief Gary Coleman. ``Especially since he said he was
playing with the child (Melissa Garza) early that morning before
going to work.
   ``He said the child was healthy and he didn't detect anything
wrong. Thirty minutes after he arrives at work, he's called and
told the child has died.''
   Garza said the allegations against his wife ``gave me a lot of
anger. But now I just want the truth. I want to know if she killed
my babies.''
   ---
   Virginia Bribiesca, Ms. Lumbrera's sister, says she was there
when Garza's mother cursed her, telling Ms. Lumbrera her children
would die at their mother's hands. ``I heard the woman say it,''
she says.
   Garza denies it ever happened. His wife ``never said anything to
me about the children being cursed by my mother,'' he said.
   Parmer County Deputy Sheriff Richard Bonham, who helped lead the
investigation into the deaths of Ms. Lumbrera's children in Texas,
says the witchcraft argument is irrelevant: ``In our investigation
that holds no water for defense of what she has done.''
   But those who know Ms. Lumbrera - a frail former meatpacker -
say there is no doubt that she believes in the supernatural.
   Maria Antillon, a close friend, said the defendant is
high-strung, emotional and frequently talked about her fervent
belief in spiritual healers and ``curanderos'' - fortune tellers or
witchcraft doctors prevalent in Hispanic culture who have the power
to bless or curse a person's life.
   ``She told me several times about witchcraft and things she
believed in like curses and things like that,'' said Mrs. Antillon.
``She used to tell me that she felt her mother-in-law had cursed
her. She said if you believe in the curanderos they will get to
you. If you don't, they won't.''
   Mrs. Antillon is one of Ms. Lumbrera's defenders.
   ``Diana went to church every Sunday when she lived here,'' she
said. ``Everybody liked her. She wasn't the type of person that
would get in trouble with a neighbor. I never heard that she had
gotten into an argument with someone else. And she loved her
kids.''
   Her aunt, Elva Hernandez, notes that Ms. Lumbrera suffered from
polio when she was a child. ``Diana was often sick when she was
young. How can they just disregard that the kids could have died
because of sickness?''
   Other friends and family members are suspicious of authorities'
motives in pressing the case. Robert Olvera, 33, Ms. Lumbrera's
cousin, says the police have actively pursued the case because the
defendant is Hispanic.
   ``You think this would happen to a Diana if she was white? No
way. Absolutely not,'' Olvera said.
   ``The police are just looking for publicity, if you ask me,'' he
said. ``That is the only way you can explain all this coming out so
many years later. The doctors ruled the children died of natural
causes.''
   Ms. Bribiesca fears the Kansas conviction will doom her sister
in Texas.
   ``She didn't get a fair trial'' in Garden City, said Ms.
Bribiesca, who resides in Kansas. ``Before this, I think she could
have gotten one in Texas, but not now. Not after this. They're
going to think she killed all her kids. But Diana's not going to
give up, I'll tell you that.''
   ---
   In late January, Ms. Lumbrera faces trial on murder charges in
Parmer County in the deaths of Joanna, Melissa and Melinda; the
grand jury said she smothered the three children to collect $15,000
in life insurance benefits.
   She also faces separate trials in Lubbock and Bailey counties in
the deaths of Jose Lionel and Erica Aleman. An investigation into
the death of Christopher Lumbrera continues. If she is convicted in
any case, she could face either life in prison or the death
penalty, administered by lethal injection.
   Gordon Green, Ms. Lumbrera's lawyer, would not allow her to be
interviewed.
   ``It's not an everyday case,'' said Green, refusing to comment
further.
   Ms. Lumbrera is being held in the Parmer County Jail on $300,000
bond. Fifteen miles away, at the Bovina Cemetery, elaborate
headstones stand over the graves of five of Ms. Lumbrera's
children.
   Each bears the same epitaph: ``Darling we miss thee.''

   The soldier stood at the memorial marked with the
names of Vietnam's valleys of death: Khe Sanh and Con Thien, Hue
and Quang Tri, An Loc and Xuan Loc.
   Then Nguyen Ngoc Hung lighted a dozen incense sticks and
silently faced his fallen American foes, memorialized in the stone
of the Dorchester Vietnam Veterans Memorial: Hain, Gormley,
Rabinovitz, Kelly, Burt. Husbands, sons, brothers. Seventy-eight of
them.
   ``I said to those men who have died during the war, `Please lay
in peace. The war is over now and I've come a long way for
reconciliation.'''
   Hung, a North Vietnamese combat veteran, had come half way
around the world for solemn ceremonies such as this one, and to
drink beer and feast on lasagna and meatballs with his former war
adversaries.
   Fifteen years after its end in 1975, American veterans of the
Vietnam War are shaking hands with the nameless, faceless foes like
Hung whom they fought as young men in the jungles of Southeast
Asia.
   They fought on different sides but now share the common bond of
duty to country and the inescapable events of history that first
brought them together.
   And they hope the healing of wounds among the warriors
themselves will nudge the U.S. government into diplomatic
recognition of its former enemy, financial aid and the lifting of a
trade embargo that is strangling Vietnam's bankrupt economy.
   As a new generation of U.S. combat forces maintains its war
readiness in the explosive Middle East, many of the boys of Vietnam
are finally standing down from a war that has seemed hauntingly
unreal to them.
   Many are going back to Vietnam in their middle years,
sentimental and mellowed by time, needing to retrace the old
battlefields that brought them of age. They gather to share the
pain of war and to heal its stings with understanding.
   And they go with their arms outstretched with hammers to build
and medicine to heal instead of rifles to kill.
   ``There comes a time for healing and I think this is the time,''
said Mary Stout, a combat nurse during the war who revisited
Vietnam two years ago. ``I think the people who start it have to be
the veterans. They understand what war's about and have a common
bond. It comes from serving your country.''
   Hoping to win diplomatic recognition, the Vietnamese government
allowed Hung, a 42-year-old college English teacher who earns $10 a
month, to tour 11 U.S. cities during six weeks in November and
December.
   The cities were Washington, Philadelphia, New York, Madison,
Wis., San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Calif., Los Angeles, New Haven,
Conn., Boston, Pittsburgh and Atlanta.
   While scores of Americans have been back to Vietnam in recent
years to help that country's disabled veterans, who languish in
poverty and menial jobs, Hung was the first Vietnam combat veteran
to visit the United States.
   He was invited by the Asia Resource Center and the National
Network of Indochina Activists, a loose network of people who
support recognition of Vietnam and trade with that country.
   ``I think Mr. Hung was here at the auspices of the Vietnamese
government to try to begin to take steps toward reconciliation with
our country,'' said Ms. Stout, president of the 40,000 member
Vietnam Veterans of America in Washington, who met with him.
   While the VVA does not yet fully support diplomatic relations
with Vietnam, it has encouraged the beginning of steps toward that
goal with the establishment of a small diplomatic office in
Vietnam, rather than a full-fledged embassy.
   Some veterans say the United States should hold out until
Americans missing in action are accounted for and there is
assurance that Vietnam is holding no prisoners. Others feel the
MIA-POW issue cannot be resolved without first establishing
diplomatic relations.
   Hung said the United States was not what he expected.
   ``I have learned a lot here,'' he said. ``It changed some of the
images about America and American people. In the past we thought
that American soldiers were professionals. They were trained to
kill and they would kill like in the My Lai massacre.''
   What Hung found were Americans who welcomed him into their
homes, drank beer with him, laughed with him and shared war
stories. Americans who were just like him, who had the same fears
and joys, whose lives were interrupted by a war that was not
necessarily of their choosing.
   ``I see they are just like me,'' Hung said. ``They suffered
enormously because of the killing, so we are just human beings, the
victims of the war.''
   One recent evening Hung and American veterans who had earlier
returned to Vietnam gathered in the home of a Boston police
sergeant who fought in the same region as Hung. They talked about
how Vietnamese and Americans had suffered.
   ``After the war I came back, rifle in my hand,'' said Hung.
``And when I looked at what the war had done to my country, very,
very sad. A million and a half or 2 million people have died. The
forests have been destroyed or defoliated and we haven't been able
to do very much about it.''
   Nearly 60,000 Americans died in the Vietnam War; 300,000 more
were wounded. Many others are still fighting the war on a different
battlefield - in their minds. They suffer from post traumatic
stress disorder, the delayed shock of combat.
   ``We've got a lot of veterans out there who are still in the
jungles of Vietnam,'' Gumersindo Gomez told Hung. Gomez, who fought
in Vietnam in the mid 1960s, is now executive director of the
Puerto Rican Veterans Association of Massachusetts in Springfield.
   ``We are still suffering the consequences here, too,'' said
Gomez, who worked in a veterans outreach center.
   ``We had nightmares and we had flashbacks and other bad
things,'' said Hung. Their biggest problem is unemployment, he
said. But the Vietnamese veterans, unlike some of their American
counterparts, were not plunged into alcohol, drugs and
homelessness, Hung said.
   ``Veterans in Vietnam were given a very warm welcome home,'' he
said.
   ``Because you won?'' asked veteran Paul O'Connell.
   ``No,'' replied Hung. ``Because we were fighting for the
country.''

   Vietnam is often seen in retrospect through the
eyes of Americans. Rarely is it viewed from the Vietnamese
perspective.
   But an old American foe, former infantryman Nguyen Ngoc Hung,
gave some rare glimpses from the North Vietnamese side during a
recent tour of the United States.
   On victory: ``The Vietnamese were determined to carry it to the
end. We didn't aim to defeat the Americans ... We fought to drive
the Americans home ... And in 1973, the Americans had to withdraw
because of the killings. But also it was due to the anti-war
movement in the United States. So we didn't actually defeat the
Americans. We drove them away.''
   On the body count: ``In America, whenever they fought a battle,
they say, `OK, one American, 20 Vietnamese (killed), they won the
battle.' They won many battles in Vietnam but what was the point
here. It is our country. If we lost the war, we have no other place
to go. We understood how barbarous the French colonialist system
was. And for many Vietnamese, we didn't see any difference between
the war against the French colonialists and the war against the
Americans.''
   On anti-war demonstrations in the United States: ``The war is
actually fought not only in Vietnam but also in the United States.
It would have been very difficult for the Vietnamese to end this
war without the anti-war movement in the United States because I
know how strong and how powerful the Air Force and artillery
support of the American Army and Navy were during the war.''
   Comparing the Americans to their southern Vietnamese allies:
``It was difficult to fight against the Americans. It was not
difficult to fight the southern (Vietnamese) Army because most of
the soldiers didn't know why they had to fight. They were drafted
from schools and from families and nobody wanted to go to war. Most
of the (American) veterans told me the same story. They didn't like
the southern Vietnamese soldiers and they didn't trust them.''

<HEAD>USDA Sleuths Outline 1991 Plan of Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators and auditors in the Agriculture
Department are sniffing at commodity programs, farm loans and
dozens of other nuts and bolts that federal workers operate, jiggle
and shift into gear.
   The specialists work for the department's Office of Inspector
General. Auditors check on whether money is spent properly, and
investigators look for ways to put people in jail if it isn't.
   Inspector General Leon Snead says in his agency's annual plan
for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 that auditors ``identified
about $32.8 million in recoveries and collections'' last year.
   Further, he said, USDA managers committed themselves to putting
$420.1 million to better use.
   Investigations resulted in 839 indictments, 671 convictions and
about $38.8 million in fines, restitutions and recoveries during
the year.
   What about 1991? More of the same, with auditors looking into
consumer protection programs such as meat and poultry, large
payments to farmers, export credit operations and financial
management.
   Snead said his office also will ``monitor implementation'' of
the 1990 farm law this year and will conduct a financial statement
audit of the Farmers Home Administration.
   ``Our investigative priorities include the timely and thorough
investigation of threats to the health and safety of the public;
employee integrity issues; and fraud in the loan, regulatory and
benefit program,'' he said.
   The 75-page annual report was made available to The Associated
Press upon request.
   According to the audit blueprint for 1991, there will be further
looks into operations of various programs operated by the
department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service
and its national network of state and county offices.
   ``In fiscal year 1990, we continued to find problems with
excessive deficiency payments (subsidies) to producers, deliberate
circumvention of the payment limitation provisions, payments for
ineligible cropland in the Conservation Reserve Program, and
incorrect crop yields and payment rates used to calculate disaster
payments,'' the report said.
   Previous audits, it added, also identified weaknesses in
producer payment certifications, compliance with cost-sharing
agreements and other details of the commodity programs.
   ``Among the audits of ASCS planned for (fiscal) 1991 are major
audits of compliance with payment limitation provisions, the 1989
disaster assistance program, tobacco program operations, claims and
debt management activities, and the 1990 emergency feed program,''
the report said.
   On the investigative side, the report said ``a significant
number of staff days'' will be spent in several areas:
   -Investigation of farmers who have used a ``scheme or device''
to avoid annual crop support payment limitations.
   -The investigation of false certification by farmers so they
could get disaster assistance.
   -Investigation of shortages of USDA-owned or USDA-mortgaged
commodities stored in commercial warehouses.
   The report said auditors will review marketing opportunities
provided by the Support for Eastern European Democracy Act of 1989,
compliance with international trade agreements, a follow-through on
prior recommendations for export subsidy programs, and
implementation of new trade provisions of the 1990 farm law.
   On the investigative side, the report said this year's efforts
will be increased to 3 percent of the office's total staff days
from 2.5 percent last year and 0.5 percent in 1988.
   Most of the investigations involved the Public Law 480 - Food
for Peace - program, the Export Enhancement Program, and the Export
Credit Guarantee Program, usually involving allegations of false
certifications by U.S. exporters

   ``The Long Walk Home'' (New Visions Pictures)
   
   Like ``Mississippi Burning'' in 1988, ``The Long Walk Home'' has
been assailed by some black leaders as being a distortion of the
struggle for civil rights in the South. Both films are told from
the white point of view, though ``The Long Walk Home'' appears to
offer more balance between the races.
   Taken on its artistic merits alone, ``The Long Walk Home'' is an
earnest, often affecting, curiously anticlimactic film. Its major
assets are two fully realized performances by accomplished
actresses, Sissy Spacek and Whoopi Goldberg.
   The setting of John Cork's script is Montgomery, Ala., in 1955,
when municipal buses were segregated and blacks were forced to sit
in the back. A seamstress named Rosa Parks decided one day that she
was too tired and took a seat at the front of the bus. She was
arrested, and Montgomery blacks staged a one-day boycott that grew
into a movement led by Martin Luther King Jr. Buses were integrated
a year later following a federal court order.
   In ``The Long Walk Home,'' nothing has changed in the social
structure of Montgomery since the institution of Jim Crow laws
following the Civil War and Reconstruction.
   The back-of-the-bus mentality prevails among the city's white
leaders, and the blacks are expected to know their place. The
decades of degradation well up, and blacks call a strike on the
municipal bus system, a prime source of revenue.
   Enter two reluctant heroines.
   Miriam Thompson (Spacek) is a well-to-do matron who accedes to
the wishes of her good ol' boy husband (Dwight Schultz). Odessa
Cotter (Goldberg) is her dutiful domestic, a woman who has never
challenged the social system.
   But Odessa believes the bus strike is the right thing to do. She
is willing to walk the nine long miles to and from work. Mrs.
Thompson sympathizes with Odessa and is increasingly appalled by
how her husband is influenced by his racist brother (Dylan Baker).
   The strike escalates into violence, and King's house is bombed.
Miriam Thompson decides to drive Odessa to work. Her act brings a
climax in her marriage and in the community.
   Inexpensively but caringly produced by Howard W. Koch Jr. and
Dave Bell, ``The Long Walk Home'' carries an emotional impact.
Spacek deftly portrays the ethical dilemma of Southern wife and
mother. In her most restrained performance, Goldberg again
impresses as one of the best actresses around. The other
performances are first-rate, especially Schultz as the husband who
is incensed to find his values questioned.
   Richard Pearce directs with a firm touch on the personal scenes,
which could have been overwrought. Only in the climax does he
stumble, reducing the issues to a simplistic level and mishandling
crowd scenes.
   The Miramax Films release of a New Visions Picture is rated PG
for language and intensity. Running time: 97 minutes.

   ``Green Card'' (Touchstone)
   
   ``Green Card'' is a wisp of a movie, a harmless puff of smoke
that's pleasing to watch and quickly forgotten.
   Gerard Depardieu stars as Georges, an illegal alien from France
who marries a stranger, Bronte (Andie MacDowell), so he can receive
a green card and live in Manhattan. Bronte has her own reasons for
marrying. A horticulturist, she wants to purchase an apartment with
a greenhouse and reasons that having another name on the lease will
persuade the co-op board to let her in.
   It works, at first, but when immigration officials become
suspicious, Georges and Bronte are forced to live together so they
can learn as much as possible about each other and present
themselves as a true couple.
   Georges, with shaggy hair and black, baggy pants, is earthy and
loveable. He smokes, he eats fatty food, he loses his temper, he
hates instant coffee. He's charming, but also cynical: he ran away
from home as a child and spent a brief time in jail (Depardieu had
the same experiences in his own life).
   Bronte, who favors green, baggy pants, is well-to-do and
idealistic. She is passionate about the environment, and especially
about her garden. She's very clean and a little repressed, not
unlike her character in ``sex, lies and videotape.'' ``I am like a
gutter, and you are like a plant!'' Georges shouts at her at one
point.
   This is the comedy of the mismatch, a reworking of ``It Happened
One Night,'' ``Woman of the Year,'' ``The Goodbye Girl'' and many
others, when opposites are thrown together and eventually attract.
   Director Peter Weir takes a low-key approach, applying the same
thoughtful style of last year's ``Dead Poets Society,'' offering
quiet shots of MacDowell watching the rain and presenting a
Manhattan so golden you'd think the lens was dipped in corn oil.
Weir also wrote and produced the film.
   ``Green Card'' is a time-killer for Depardieu, who likes to make
three or four movies a year and can currently be seen in the far
more demanding ``Cyrano de Bergerac.''
   But the French actor, in his first predominantly
English-speaking role, does get the most out of a slim part,
showing wonderful timing and giving the film a sweet, offbeat
quality. The scenes in which Georges and Bronte concoct love
letters and put together an album of phony wedding and honeymoon
pictures are especially funny, such as when Georges pretends he's
writing from Africa and complains the elephants are keeping him
awake.
   The film wants to be liked - and succeeds - but the touch is so
light it leaves no mark. Even as Georges faces deportation, there
is no real tension in ``Green Card,'' no demands made of the
audience, nothing to think about when it's over, a sweet dream that
fades away after the lights go on.
   The Touchstone Pictures Release is rated PG-13. Running Time:
108 minutes.

   ``Love Is a Strange Hotel'' (RNA) - Gregson and Collister
   
   One problem with people who use acoustic guitars as a primary
means of musical expression is inflation - of their songs and
themselves.
   Such self-importance causes folk-rock artists Clive Gregson and
Christine Collister to miss a good opportunity with their new disc,
``Love Is a Strange Hotel.'' On the record, the duo abandon their
own relatively undistinguished compositions for an eclectic set of
cover songs.
   Their choices show a wide-ranging taste. Unfortunately, a few
bad song choices and overwrought performances make this an overall
disappointment.
   When Aztec Camera's Roddy Frame sings his own ``How Men Are,''
it works as a man extending an arm in sympathy to a woman who's
been jilted. Switch the sex of the narrator and Collister turns the
song into self-pitying male-bashing.
   Similarly, turning 10cc's ``The Things We Do for Love'' and Paul
Carrack's ``Always Better With You'' into acoustic ballads comes
off as a misguided attempt to turn pop into poetry. Carrack's song
is a soulful shout of joy and needs more exuberance than Gregson
and Collister can give it.
   The performances of Bruce Springsteen's ``One Step Up'' and
Jackson Browne's ``For a Dancer'' bring emotional ballads one step
closer to New Age background music.
   Collister has one shining moment that almost cancels out her
sins elsewhere. The pain in her voice perfectly captures the
heartache of unrequited love on Stephen Fearing's ``The Most
Beguiling Eyes.'' Merle Haggard's ``Today I Started Loving You
Again'' gives the pair its most effective duet.

   Costumes are often forgotten once films are
over, but not when Glenn Close is around. Her closet includes suits
from ``Jagged Edge,'' an overcoat from ``Fatal Attraction'' and the
Marquise de Merteuil's low-cut gownsfrom ``Dangerous Liasions.''
   She takes good care of those clothes; she never knows when
they'll be needed. Recently, for example, the Fashion Institute of
Technology asked her to donate her wardrobe from ``Reversal of
Fortune'' for an exhibit on fashion in film. Close was able to
oblige.
   Her costumes are also a reminder of a daring, complicated life
on screen, a career spent in coats of many colors, from pure white
in ``The Natural'' to shining black in ``Fatal Attraction.''
   ``Those characters all stay with me in some way,'' said Close,
dressed for a recent interview in a mocha brown, suede jacket and
tan pants, an appropriate outfit for a woman who grew up on a
500-acre estate in Greenwich, Conn.
   ``You have to love your character, even Alex Forrest (of `Fatal
Attraction'), who was a very haunting character. You become
intimate. You gain an understanding of their behavior and I usually
emphasize deeply with them.''
   As the reserved, unhappy Sunny von Bulow of ``Reversal of
Fortune,'' she favored a sweater outfit with a single strand of
pearls. She wore gowns and long earrings for her new film,
``Hamlet,'' portraying Queen Gertrude in the latest version of
Shakespeare's classic tragedy.
   ``Hamlet'' stars Mel Gibson as the Danish prince incapable of
making up his mind, and also features Alan Bates, Ian Holm, Paul
Scofield and Helena Bonham Carter.
   Close, a veteran stage actress, was not in awe of portraying
Gertrude. She went about it like any other part, reading the play
several times, watching other films of ``Hamlet'' and taking a
personal approach to analyzing her character.
   ``I just decided she was married very young and married a man
much older than her for political reasons,'' said Close, a
five-time Academy Award nominee.
   ``All the descriptions of her come across as a very tactile,
very sensual woman. The ghosts and the king and Hamlet revolved
around her. There's something in that woman that's dazzling,
necessary, sensual, selfish.''
   She was born in 1947 in Greenwich, which her ancestors helped
found in the late 17th century. Growing up, Close never dressed
like a queen, but remembers years spent in the country playing
make-believe in a number of roles: a bride, a cowboy, an orphan, a
woman dying of cancer.
   Helping were her two grandmothers. One had wanted to be a
singer, the other an actress. They were perfect coaches, exposing
her to opera and ballet, even offering tricks for improving the
memory. She also made trips to Manhattan, which gave her a chance
to try different kinds of clothes.
   ``We'd go every year to `The Nutcracker' and go to the circus
and we'd also come in to have our eyes examined. It was like going
to Oz. We'd always get dressed up. When we were a little older and
actually lived in New York, it was a shock to be in jeans and just
be comfortable.''
   She postponed going to college to pursue a singing career and
was briefly married to rock guitarist Cabot Wade. Tired of life on
the road, she enrolled at William and Mary College in 1970,
majoring in drama.
   After graduating, she starred in a number of plays for regional
theaters, including ``King Lear,'' ``Uncle Vanya'' and ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' among others.
   Her breakthrough came in 1980 with the Broadway musical
``Barnum,'' for which she earned a Tony nomination as the circus
showman's wife and gave over 300 performances. In 1984, she won a
Tony for her starring role in Tom Stoppard's ``The Real Thing.''
   Close's film career began in 1982 with ``The World According to
Garp.'' playing the free-spirited mother of Robin Williams. She was
a sympathetic actress at first, inspiring Robert Redford in ``The
Natural'' and mourning an old friend's suicide in ``The Big
Chill.''
   But in 1987, tired of warm smiles and soft tears, Close jumped
at the chance to play the sexy, explosive ``other woman'' of
``Fatal Attraction,'' dropping 10 pounds for the role, her sweet
image evaporating into a single pot of boiled rabbit.
   She considers ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' based on the 18th-century
novel, her favorite film, admiring the Marquise's cunning and
ruthlessness as she spars with the equally formidable Vicomte de
Valmont (John Malkovich). The Marquise makes and breaks rules,
Close notes, and is controlling her image rather being controlled,
an actress born at least 200 years too soon.
   ``I liked some of those old roles, but they didn't particulary
interest me,'' said Close, who plays nice again in ``Sarah, Plain
and Tall,'' a children's story to be aired Feb. 3 on CBS.
   ``I prefer the battles between men and women and what's cliched
and what's not. It's one of the great fascinations. It's exhausting
emotionally but that kind of exhaustion for me is ultimately very
cathartic, exhilarating.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Top Auction Houses Romance the Eastern Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>DEBORAH SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's top auction houses have set up shop in
Berlin, seeking to acquire and sell treasures kept hidden during
the Communist rule in eastern Europe.
   Sotheby's, the world's largest art auction house, has chosen a
former Prussian palace in eastern Berlin as the site of its new
office. The previous tenant was the German-Soviet Friendship
Society.
   Rival Christie's has selected a posh ground-floor setting just
off the Kurfuerstendamm, western Berlin's most fashionable shopping
boulevard, as its new address in the capital.
   Both aim to explore the unknown art world of the former
Communist east that was largely closed off to capitalist dealers
during the Cold War.
   ``Sotheby's had long thought about going to Berlin. With the
opening of the Wall, it became necessary to open,'' said H. Josef
Koenig, director of the Berlin office.
   Koenig says he gets offers every day from eastern Germans
seeking appraisals of silver, paintings or antiques they had hidden
for years.
   The objects include old Meissen porcelain, pieces of Biedermeier
furniture, silver, jewelry and paintings. Sometimes works of real
value appear and can make their owners rich.
   Shortly before unity Oct. 3, an East German from Dresden showed
up at the Frankfurt branch of Sotheby's with a painting he had
inherited.
   The retired worker had hidden the painting after the Red Army
fought its way into Germany in 1945 and kept it secret from East
German authorities who had forbidden private ownership of art.
   Experts identified the painting as a portrait by the 20th
century German expressionist Emil Nolde. Out of sight for
half-a-century, the work had been given up for lost by art
connoisseurs. The painting was valued at 1.35 million marks
($900,000).
   ``Nobody knows what is over there,'' said Koenig.
   To find out, Christie's hired Peter Betthausen, former director
of the National Gallery in what was East Berlin and a specialist in
German art of the 19th and 20th centuries, to head its office.
   Christie's is also staffing its Berlin office with experts to
assess the value of objects offered, focusing on silver and
jewelry.
   Sotheby's eastern expansion does not stop in Berlin. An office
already exists in Budapest, Hungary, and another is planned for
Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1991.
   The arrival of the two major auction houses could signal the
start of a revival of Berlin's prewar role as Germany's major art
center.
   Berlin began its steep decline as an art mecca in 1933 when
Adolf Hitler took power. The Nazis banned many artists, and in 1939
publicly burned more than 1,000 works of art that they deemed
``offensive.''
   Socialist Realism was the tune of the day when the Communists
came to power in eastern Germany after World War II. Artists who
did not conform could not exhibit.
   The unstable postwar political situation also affected West
Berlin. The city found it hard to attract valuable works for
museums while the city was divided.
   But now that the city is open again, both auction houses have
spared no expense for the occasion.
   Sotheby's sponsored a public exhibition that drew large crowds
in October to Schloss Charlottenburg to see modern paintings by
such artists as Kandinsky, Matisse and Modigliani.
   Christie's flew in Lord Carrington, a former NATO secretary
general who is chairman of Christie's International, for the
official Dec. 10 opening of its offices.
   However, it may take a while for Berlin to become the site of
the kind of spectacular auctions held regularly in London. While
many foreigners visit the city to look at what is left of the
Berlin Wall, most do not come regularly.
   ``Germans love traveling to London,'' said Angela Hucke,
Christie's press officer for Germany. Auctions are also most likely
to fetch higher prices in London, which has a more international
buying audeience than Berlin.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Not the New Madonna, But Something in Common</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SPENCER BRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Betty Boo, already a star in Britain and riding
``Doin' the Do'' up the charts in the United States, doesn't mind
being compared to Madonna - up to a point.
   ``But I don't want people believing I'm a wannabee. I admire
Madonna, like I admire Margaret Thatcher - though I don't agree
with her politics - because I like to see strong women, women in
control,'' said the feisty, ravishingly attractive 20-year-old.
   ``I feel weak if I am not in control. I always like to be in the
driver's seat. That's why I don't like flying: I always think I am
going to crash, I don't trust the pilot.''
   She's flying high on her own.
   In Britain she has had two Top 10 singles, and her album,
``Boomania,'' has made the top five. And she has signed a U.S.
recording contract with Seymour Stein of Sire Records, the man who
signed Madonna.
   ``Madonna told Seymour Stein she liked my video, she thought I
was cute. She told Seymour, `Oh, she needs a choreographer, she
should use Luis''' - Luiscamacho Jose Gutlerez, who did Madonna's
``Vogue'' video.
   He is helping with Betty Boo's next video, and other connections
are happening quickly. She has signed up with Larry Frazin and
Larry Tollin, the American managers who also handle Paula Abdul.
   Half-Scottish, half-Malaysian by birth and 100 percent Cockney
in speech, the singer changed her name from Alison Clarkson because
someone once remarked that she looked like Betty Boop, the ditzy
cartoon character.
   ``I don't see myself as a bimbo, because I'm headstrong,'' she
said. ``I'm not thick. A lot of people think I look good and it
helps. But I'm not going to go topless or anything like that.''
   She began her music career with two girlfriends as the rap group
She Rockers. Three years ago they met Professor Griff of Public
Enemy at a McDonald's near their home in the west London working
class district of Shepherd's Bush.
   Griff liked their insulting attitude, and offered to produce a
single in New York. ``Give It a Rest'' was the result.
   But the singer didn't identify with the radical black separatism
and hard-core rap she encountered in New York. She returned to
England, disillusioned, after a month.
   Fired with new determination in 1988 after the death of her
father, a driver on the London subway, she took a course in studio
sound engineering so she could control her own work.
   She connected with the pioneering British dance label Rhythm
King and wrote the rap and sang on ``Hey DJ'' by the Beatmasters, a
top 10 song in Britain last year.
   Her own record deal followed, and the company bought her a
keyboard, sequencer and sampler. She mastered the equipment and
composed 10 songs in six weeks.
   ```Doin' the Do' was the first real song I wrote,'' she said. It
was aimed at a math teacher who gave her a hard time and sums up
Betty's need to be in control and to win.
   She later ran into the teacher, who asked how she as doing.
   ``I said I had just received my 10,000 pounds ($20,000) bonus
and it made him mad,'' she said.
   ``I think I show people that a 20-year-old girl with hardly any
academic qualifications can be successful. I really wanted to show
my teacher. I think he is really pleased for me now.
   ``Looking back at school, what I did was wrong. I should have
studied. But in a way I'm glad I didn't because I wouldn't be doing
what I do now.''
   Betty Boo's videos reflect her style, sort of a B-movie version
of ``Barbarella.''
   ``I like the way they did their makeup in the '60s, I like the
clothes. They were simple, quite sexy and raunchy, but it still had
a hard-edged appeal. It's really tough, like the Emma Peel stuff,''
she said, referring to Diana Rigg's karate-kicking role in ``The
Avengers.''
   All this toughness is her revenge for growing up as an outsider.
   ``A lot of people can't tell whether I'm half white or half
black, can't tell whether I'm half Puerto Rican or half Japanese,
or half this or that. I used to lie. I used to say I was white so I
could fit in. Afterwards I was really proud of my looks. I used to
see models who looked more like me than the common girls who
criticized me.''
   Betty Boo is recording her second album and hopes to tour in
1992 with a Hollywood musical-style live show. And she's coping
with the stresses of success.
   ``Being in this business makes me very moody and determined. I
want things to be done and I can get very stroppy if they are not
done. I can see why Madonna is the way she is. I am going through
what she went through 10 years ago. I am quite frightened it will
change me.''

<TEXT>
   A woman slumped in a phone booth, crying. A
cheap motel. The rotting door of an outdoor toilet.
   This is Carver Country, Raymond Carver Country, stories and
poems set in the Pacific Northwest that make ``Twin Peaks'' seem as
threatening as ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.'' Couples drink and
fight. A man grovels at the knees of his ex-wife. Furniture is sold
on the front lawn.
   ``A little autobiography and a lot of imagination are best,''
Carver once wrote. These bleak images were based on real places and
real people. He grew up working class in Yakima, Wash., and wrote
about it even when he could afford to live elsewhere. He was a
long-time drunk who later composed tough-love stories.
   ``Carver Country'' (Scribners, $35) collects photographs of the
late writer's friends and family and of Yakima and other places he
lived. The pictures, fittingly, are in black and white. Some of
them are pretty, shots of water and open fields, but the majority
show seedy bars, rundown buildings and faces that stare instead of
smile.
   ``He was, from the start, an image-maker,'' Carver's wife,
author-poet Tess Gallagher, recalled in a interview. ``That would
correspond to writing photographically. He would zero in on some
precise detail.''
   ``Color doesn't render ideas very well,'' photographer Bob
Adelman insisted during a phone interview. ``I think of the broken
door in this motel Ray sent me to. God knows what it would look
like in color. Or the broken saws in the factory his father worked
- they're strong images of things not working out.''
   In 1984, Life magazine thought the author might win the Pulitzer
Prize and assigned Adelman to spend a couple of months with him.
William Kennedy won, but Adelman came up with another project:
combine pictures of Carver and the people and places he had known
with the writing they helped inspire. Carver died of cancer at age
50 in 1988, but Adelman continued, taking several photographs last
year.
   ``Because Ray's descriptions were often minimal, it was a great
opportunity for photographs,'' Adelman said. ``Most of the pictures
were based on real things in his stories. You kind of learned what
he was familiar with and where his imagination took off from.''
   Gallagher, who contributes an introduction to the book, didn't
like the title at first. It seemed smug, condescending, a way of
taking a vast and complex body of work and reducing it to a catch
phrase.
   But she warmed to it. Like the best of Carver's stories, it was
simple, but not simplistic. ``Carver Country'' is a place, but it's
also a state of mind, a sense of holding on against bad luck, a
resignation to living with debts that no one could possibly expect
to pay.
   His earlier stories were the strong, silent type: flat on the
surface, full of mystery and terror underneath.
   In ``Why, Honey?'' a woman is surprised to learn her son, ``a
good boy,'' set off firecrackers in a girl's ears. The eerie ``So
Much Water, So Close to Home'' tells of a man who finds a
mutiliated body in the river and takes his time letting anybody
know what happened.
   Carver wasn't trying to write ``Who killed Laura Palmer''
thrillers. Mysteries remained mysteries. Important questions were
left unanswered, perhaps because the author himself didn't know how
to resolve them.
   ``I met him at this writers conference in Dallas in the 1977,''
Gallagher recalled. ``I had gone home with his books and I was
reading aloud one of the stories to my sister. She said, `I don't
know what happens at the end of that story, call him up.'
   ``So I decided I'd call him up. I called him up and said, `We're
not satisfied with this story; what is going on here?' He said,
`I'm not going to tell you any more.'''
   But Carver changed, his luck changed. He had nearly died from
alcohol; in the mid-1970s, he was suffering from blackouts and
depression and was hospitalized several times. Living alone, his
first marriage destroyed, Carver joined Alcoholics Anonymous in
1977 and finally stopped drinking.
   Gratified just to be writing again, he was eager to fill in the
blanks. ``Cathedral,'' his acclaimed collection of stories, was
published in 1984 and people started talking.
   In ``Where I'm Callng From,'' two recovering alcoholics comfort
each other on the front porch of a drying-out facility. In the
title story, two men, one of them blind, sketch a cathedral
together. ``His fingers rode my fingers as my hand went over the
paper,'' the man who sees explains. ``It was like nothing else in
my life up to now.''
   ``A Small, Good Thing'' was the peak, the story of a young
couple's heartbreaking trip through Carver Country and the lonely
baker who gives them hope for a way out. Gallagher received a
letter from a woman who had read it on a plane and burst out
crying.
   With the success of ``Cathedral,'' Carver returned to his first
love, poetry. He was living with Gallagher and writing more
beautifully than ever, but his health broke down. By 1988, he had
developed tumors in his brain and in his lungs. He died that
August.
   ``Don't weep for me,'' Carver wrote in ``Gravy,'' one of his
last poems, ``I've had 10 years longer than I or anyone expected.
Pure gravy. And don't forget it.''
   ``All of us who knew Ray are still bumping into walls, trying to
get on with our lives,'' said Gallagher, who had married Carver in
his last June.
   ``The feeling has been if you have tough times, tough luck,''
she said. ``If things are rough, you must have deserved it; you
didn't work hard enough. He made the educated segment aware that
these people had feelings and the dimensions of their suffering
became real and palpable.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Lost Job Means New Career for Joe Diffie</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   It took the closing of an Oklahoma
foundry to get singer Joe Diffie into the country music business.
   He had long dreamed of having a career in music, and when he was
laid off in 1986, he decided to move to Nashville and pursue one.
   The twist of fate paid off. Diffie's first record, ``Home,'' was
a No. 1 hit in November.
   ``Seeing it come to fruition is very gratifying,'' the
31-year-old performer said in an interview during his third day
back in Nashville after a whirlwind, five-week tour of
one-nighters.
   Diffie had been working at the foundry in Duncan, Okla., running
a core machine, when he lost his job and his $1,700-a-month salary.
   ``I never had any hair left on my arms; it was always singed
off,'' he recalled about the job. ``I always had burns all over me.
I detested every second of the job. I didn't like any aspect of it
except the people there.
   ``It was a blessing in disguise when it shut down. If it hadn't,
I'd probably still be there or some place like it.''
   After reaching Nashville, he took a job for 1{ years in the
shipping and receiving department at the Gibson Guitar factory.
   ``Home'' spent six weeks in the Top 10 on the country music
popularity charts, faring better than tunes by more established
singers such as Anne Murray and Eddie Rabbitt.
   The wistful song is about the values of home life:
   ``A swimming hole and fishing pole and the feel of the muddy
road between my toes ...
   ``A back yard swing where I wuld sit and mom would sing
`Amazing Grace' while she hung out the clothes ...
   ``An easy chair with my daddy there and the smell of Sunday
supper on the stove ...''
   Diffie said the song stirred strong emotions.
   ``I think everybody related to it, regardless of whether they
were raised in the country or city, because everybody has a home in
their memory. When I first heard it, I got a lump in my throat. It
brings back a feeling of when you were younger, safe and secure
without any worries and no problems.
   ``It was a sweet song but not too syrupy.''
   The tune is on his first album, ``A Thousand Winding Roads,'' on
Epic Records. The LP is a mixture of ballads and up-tempo songs
performed in a style described by Billboard Magazine as ``Randy
Travis with a Merle Haggard catch to his voice.''
   His second single released from the album is ``If You Want Me
To,'' a traditional country weeper about a man offering to leave
his lover if that's what she wants.
   Another cut on the LP, ``There Goes the Neighborhood,'' is a
ballad about marriages dissolving. The cut ``Almost Home'' is about
the decline of an aging parent.
   Diffie, who co-wrote four of the songs on the album, says he's
taken advantage of a new era in country music.
   ``There's been a changing of the guard in country music: the
listeners, the artists, the radio stations and the people producing
the records,'' he said.
   ``The songs are getting better and better with the new
songwriters coming in. That's not to say the old ones are bad. But
it's almost like country music has got a little edge to it now.
   ``Some of the more sensitive matters are being touched upon.''
   Diffie is a native of the Duncan area and spent much of his life
there. His father had a huge collection of country music and his
parents instilled in him a love of the music. He remembers singing
``Amazing Grace,'' ``You Are My Sunshine'' and ``Peace in the
Valley'' with his two sisters while they traveled in the family
pickup truck.
   He briefly attended Cameron University in Oklahoma and eyed a
career as a heart surgeon or chiropractor, but he was more
interested in music.
   He has a six-piece band and a fan club with the catchy name
``Diffie Cult.'' Keeping things in the family, his mother is its
president.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riot police club left-wing demonstrators in a
picturesque Rome piazza as two Americans flee. It is the height of
the years of political violence in Italy, brought to life more than
a decade later in a new film by director John Frankenheimer.
   ``Year of the Gun'' stars Andrew McCarthy, Sharon Stone and
Valerie Golino in a thriller about a journalist who becomes
involved in a political maelstrom.
   Apart from the interiors, which were shot at Rome's Cinecitta
studios, most scenes in the ``Year of the Gun'' were filmed in the
piazzas and alleys of the Eternal City.
   The new film is based on Michael Mewshaw's book of the same
title.
   Frankenheimer has brought other books to the screen, including
Thomas Gladdis' ``Birdman of Alcatraz,'' Fletcher Kenbel's ``Seven
Days in May'' and Richard Condon's ``The Manchurian Candidate.''
   For Mewshaw, Rome is the principle character of the novel.
   ``The political background, the journalistic process and the
interaction between the different characters and Rome form the
action line,'' he said.
   ``Given that Rome is such a source of wonder, the movie has the
potential to portray its seductive charm and visual beauty.''
   The $15 million film is expected to reach theaters in August.

   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) - The Palm Springs International Film
Festival will screen 22 movies during its second annual event on
Jan. 9-13.
   The list of international films - including titles from Europe,
Japan, China and New Zealand - includes the world premiere of
``Delusion,'' a black comedy-thriller by American director Carl
Colpaert.
   Five films are being submitted as their home country's official
entry for an Academy Award nomination as best foreign language
film: the Soviet Union's ``Taxi Blues,'' China's ``Ju Dou,''
Italy's ``Open Doors,'' Austria's ``Requiem for Dominic'' and
Hungary's ``Diary for My Father and Mother.''
   The 1991 Film Festival, which will also present documentaries
and student films, will screen its films at five theaters in Palm
Springs. Many of the movies, including ``Ju Dou'' and ``Taxi
Blues,'' showed last year at other film festivals and have been in
limited release in art houses.

   RUIDOSO, N.M. (AP) - Five Soviet artists will exhibit their
works at the Second Annual Hubbard Art Award for Excellence
competition to be held in June.
   They will be joined by 48 Americans who are widely considered to
be among the finest representational artists in this country.
   Works created for the 1990 Hubbard Art Award are currently on
exhibit in Moscow. The 40 works displayed are by prominent American
painters and sculptors working in realism.
   This cultural exchange was initiated by Fort Worth businessman
R.D. Hubbard, founder of the Hubbard Art Award. The $250,000 prize,
which is the largest given in the art world, was created to
recognize excellence in American representational art.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge dropped again in November for the fifth consecutive monthly
decline, the government said in a report that offered little hope
the slumping economy would recover soon.
   The 1.2 percent plunge in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators, reported Friday, followed an even
worse 1.3 percent drop in October. That decline was the worst since
November 1987.
   The steep drop follows a spate of gloomy economic news for the
month and was seen as a sign the economy would continue to
deteriorate.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Cash-strapped Pan Am said it has had no word
from TWA owner Carl Icahn on whether his takeover proposal still
stands and whether the ouster of Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett
was a condition for the deal.
   Unidentified sources quoted in Friday's editions of the Wall
Street Journal and the New York Times said Plaskett's removal was
on a list of terms attached to a proposed merger of the two
carriers.
   Officials at Trans World Airlines' suburban Mount Kisco, N.Y.,
offices did not return several phone calls seeking confirmation of
that caveat.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Fees earned on Wall Street for underwriting
corporate stocks and bonds plunged in 1990 to a six-year low,
providing further statistical evidence that the booming 1980s have
died.
   Investment banking fees from new issues of stocks and bonds
plunged 38 percent to $1.93 billion from $3.09 billion in 1989,
Securities Data Co. reported Friday.
   Combined with a sharp drop in other critical investment banking
activity and thousands of layoffs, analysts said the figures signal
losses at many securities firms for the year.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Japan's largest electrical company closed its
$6.6 billion purchase of entertainment colossus MCA Inc.,
completing the largest Japanese acquisition of an American firm.
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. acquired about 77.7 million
shares of MCA stock at $66 per share, Matsushita said in a
statement Saturday. Its acquisitions amount to about 97 percent of
outstanding MCA shares.
   U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia on Friday rejected an
emergency request by Go-Video Inc. to block consummation of the
deal. Go-Video sought a postponement until a formal antitrust
challenge could be mounted.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - ``Keating Five'' Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. is
asking the Treasury Department to study the condition of the
insurance industry, warning that the nation cannot afford to ignore
the development of problems similar to the savings and loan
debacle.
   Riegle, D-Mich., who chairs the Senate Banking Committee asked
the Treasury Department to examine whether insurance companies have
made too many risky investments and to estimate the risk to the
economy of a major insurance company failure.
   Riegle made the requests in a letter dated Dec. 20 and released
Thursday.

   PARIS (AP) - The French government has approved plans by

   The British banking group will acquire 51 percent of Europeenne
de Banque initially and purchase the remaining 49 percent early

   The acquisition will give Barclays some prestigious real estate

   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - Canada's state-owned nuclear power

   WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) - Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. says it

   Wheeling-Pitt said Friday the charge was required to show the
company's expectations of medical costs and to reflect accounting

   The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently approved a new
rule, effective in 1993, that requires companies to subtract from
earnings a portion of the costs of benefits they have promised to

<NOTE>Eds: Longer version on general news wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   At gasoline pumps and city dumps, new state laws take effect
Jan. 1, raising taxes on motorists in California, Delaware, Florida
and Massachusetts and imposing mandatory recycling in Connecticut
and Wisconsin.
   A higher income tax, expected to generate $1.3 billion, goes
into effect in New Jersey. Democratic Gov. Jim Florio says the
highly unpopular plan will give homeowners property tax relief and
address imbalances in rich and poor school districts.
   Strapped states continue to search for revenue. Washington state
is imposing a $10 a pack penalty on untaxed cigarettes, often
illegally bought by non-Indians on Indian reservations. Delaware is
raising its cigarette taxes 5 cents a pack.
   Gasoline taxes go up 4 cents in Massachusetts and Florida, 3
cents in Delaware, but only 1 cent in California, which prefers the
gradual pain of adding a penny each year through 1994. Just a month
ago, the federal government got a nickel-a-gallon gas tax increase,
and Congress has raised alcohol and cigarette taxes nationwide
effective Jan. 1.
   To find a tax going down, you'd have to go to Indiana, where
drivers were registering their vehicles out of state to avoid
excise taxes. That tax will be cut from $413 to $289 for the first
year on a $15,000 car.
   A Florida law bans state legislators and some 30,000 other
public officials from soliciting or accepting any gift over $100
from a lobbyist, a lobbyist's employer or a political action
committee.
   On the environmental front, Connecticut is telling residents and
businesses to separate corrugated cardboard, newspapers, office
paper, glass and metal food containers, leaves, scrap metal,
storage batteries and waste oil for recycling.
   Wisconsin is phasing in mandatory recycling with a ban on
disposing of car batteries, waste oil or major appliances in
landfills or incinerators. Indiana is requiring stores that sell
automotive batteries to accept customers' used batteries for
recycling.
   Michigan is attacking the problem of tire dumps, which have been
sites of major fires and Asian Tiger mosquito infestations. The law
will require scrap tire haulers and collection sites to register
with the state.
   Tennessee is imposing a $250 fine for anyone releasing more than
24 balloons of the non-biodegradable kind that choke sea animals.
Some lawmakers tried to poke holes in the measure by noting that a
crowd in the University of Tennessee's 95,000-seat football stadium
could still legally release about 2.3 million balloons.
   Shoppers in Maine can go to malls and large stores on Sunday
year-round as a result of an initiative approved by voters in
November. The old ``blue law'' had so many loopholes that opponents
attacked its fairness.

<HEAD>British Airways, KLM and Sabena Abandon Joint Venture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC, KLM Royal Dutch Airways and
Belgium's Sabena World Airways announced Monday they are scrapping
their plans jointly to form a regional airline with a hub in
Brussels.
   The three carriers in a joint news release cited ``practical
difficulties involved in implementing the original objectives.'' A
KLM spokesman acknowledged that uncertainty over obtaining European
Community regulatory approval was a factor.
   The three airlines had intended to develop their venture into a
regional European airline, using Brussels' Zaventem airport as the
center of a hub-and-spoke route network linking 75 cities
throughout Europe.
   British Airways specified in its own news release that ``Sabena
SA has made it clear that the group requires recapitalization and
reorganization of a kind which the present minority investments
agreed by British Airways and KLM could not solve.''
   Under the original terms of the deal, British Airways and KLM
each had agreed to buy a 20 percent stake in the joint venture for
about $66 million apiece. The Belgian-government controlled Sabena
SA was to have held the remaining 60 percent.
   Current plans call for Sabena to take back the shares held by
British Airways and KLM.
   The capital already invested is being converted into a loan for
repayment on Dec. 31, 1991, the airlines said. British Airways said
it already had contributed 17 million pounds, or $33 million.
   In Amsterdam, KLM spokesman Peter Wellhuner said many factors
led to the decision. In addition to high fuel costs, he cited the
uncertainty of regulatory approval.
   ``We have had ample consultation with the European Commission on
this case and up until now we haven't had any certainty of its
approval,'' Wellhuner said.
   The European Commission, which safeguards competition, decided
in June that the deal could hurt competition at the Brussels
airport, and offered to negotiate a settlement. The airlines
refused, and instead prepared legal arguments supporting the
arrangement.
   The British government cleared the deal in July, finding that
travelers would benefit from the hub the airlines wanted to create.
   British Airways said the decision to scrap the joint venture
wouldn't result in any capital loss for the company.

   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. has
closed its $6.6 billion purchase of entertainment giant MCA Inc.,
completing the largest Japanese acquisition of a U.S. company.
   Matsushita, Japan's largest electronics company, said it
acquired about 97 percent of MCA's outstanding shares for $66 a
share, Matsushita said in a statement released Saturday.
   MCA shareholders also are entitled to stock in a newly-created
company MCA is spinning off that will own is WWOR television
station in Secaucus, N.J. Federal regulations prohibit foreign
companies from owning a U.S. television station.
   MCA owns Universal Studios, maker of such films as ``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestial'' and ``Jaws.'' It also produces television series
and holds recording contracts with such artists as Elton John and
Guns N' Roses.
   MCA shareholders filed a lawsuit to block the sale but a federal
judge in Los Angeles rejected the bid Friday.
   U.S. District Judge Manuel Real did not dismiss the suit, but
said there was insufficient evidence presented to block the deal.
   In a separate matter, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia
denied a last-minute motion Friday in an antitrust suit filed by
Go-Video Inc., maker of dual deck VCRs.
   Matsushita products are sold in the United States through such
brand names as Panasonic, Technics and Quasar.

   Share prices ended lower in an abbreviated session
Monday on London's Stock Exchange.
   The market closed about four hours earlier than normal on New
Year's Eve.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 16.9 points, or 0.8 percent, at 2,143.5.
   For the year, the 100-share index fell 279.2 points, or 11.5
percent from its 1989 closing level of 2,422.7.
   Closing volume was 129.9 million shares.
   The market has been plagued with worries about Britain's
economic downturn, and the country's high interest rates which
currently stand at about 14 percent. In recent months, the market
also has been nervous about the Gulf crisis. These concerns have
made investors shy away from the market, and business, as a result,
has been persistently slow.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 11.5 points from

   The stock market declined slightly today in a
quiet final session of an uninspired year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 123.99 points from
last New Year's through Friday's close, slipped 2.72 to 2,626.49 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 450 up, 590 down and
569 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 14.02 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Activity was expected to be light throughout the session in a

   Analysts said traders felt little urgency to make any fresh
commitments, pending developments in the weeks ahead on the
showdown in the Persian Gulf.
   Stocks didn't get much benefit from declining interest rates in
the credit markets. Prices of long-term government bonds rose
nearly $5 for each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in

<TEXT>
   BellSouth Enterprises has agreed to acquire
Graphic Scanning Corp., a New Jersey-based cellular telephone and
paging service provider, for $180 million, the two companies
announced Monday.
   BellSouth, which signed a definitive agreement to pay $5.50 for
each of the 32.4 million outstanding shares of Graphic stock, said
the deal is expected to close in mid-1991. It is subject to
shareholder and regulatory approval.
   Atlanta-based BellSouth said the acquisition would enhance its
standing as an international provider of wireless
telecommunications services. Graphic, based in Teaneck, N.J.,
operates in the United States and the United Kingdom.
   The Graphic deal will increase BellSouth's paging business to
more than 1.25 million pagers worldwide.
   In a related action, BellSouth said it had entered into a
revolving credit agreement with Cellular Mobile Systems of Indiana
Inc. under which BellSouth will make secured loans of up to $60
million to refinance existing debt and for general corporate
purposes.
   CMS is the Graphic Scanning subsidiary which is BellSouth's
partner in the Indiana Telephone Co., a non-wireline cellular
carrier. As part of the loan transaction, BellSouth will assume
operational control of ITC.

<DATELINE>WESTBORO, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troubled Data General Corp. has dropped a
product development agreement with Japan's Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp., company officials said today.
   The agreement with NTT to build high-speed hubs for private data
communications networks was announced in 1987. The communications
systems were to link voice, data and computers in large, private
communications networks such as those used by corporations and
universities.
   NTT executives said then that the company planned to buy about
$130 million of equipment to be developed by Data General. The
purchases were to be made in a five-year period beginning in 1989.
   But the project was scrapped after research showed there was not
a strong market in Japan for such systems, said Jim Dunlap, a
spokesman for Data General.
   ``As a result of the review of the market place, and the
potential for the product, Data General and NTT reached a mutual
agreement to drop the plan,'' Dunlap said.
   Barry Willman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein in New York,
attributed the dropped deal to Data General's mounting financial
pressures, a shift in the computer market and the firm's increased
emphasis on its Aviion workstations.
   ``The program had been under review for awhile,'' Willman said.
``It had encountered delays during the years, and with Data
General's continuing financial pressures there came a time when a
prudent decision was made to terminate the project.''
   Data General has not had a profitable year since 1985, when its
employment peaked at 17,700. Since then the firm has suffered a
string of losses and employment has continued to decline.
   Dunlap said the firm had eliminated about 2,300 jobs in 1990
through cuts and attrition. The company announced in August that
more than 2,000 workers would be laid off.
   Data General lost $139 million in its most recent fiscal year.
Revenues were $1.22 billion, compared with $1.31 billion the year
before.
   Analysts say the minicomputer slump has acted as a drag on
earnings and hampered the company's efforts to become profitable.

   Soybeans were higher and corn and wheat were
steady to lower at the opening of a pre-holiday session of the
Chicago Board of Trade today.
   Soybean were expected to gain throughout the day, recovering
from losses Friday when the future dipped to new contract lows.
   Wheat was expected to gain on support from soybeans and word
that the U.S. Agriculture Department is subsidizing some wheat
purchases.
   Corn had some support from wheat and soybeans but later turned
mixed after being weighed down by light export demand.
   Trading is expected to be very light today because of the New

than normal today.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were } cent lower to 1

   USG Corp., one of the nation's largest building
products manufacturers, said today it is postponing debt payments
and selling a major subsidiary because of the declining
construction industry.
   The company said its major bank lenders have agreed to cooperate
in the refinancing plan. In the interim, USG will defer payments of
$105 million in principal due today to its senior lending banks. It
also will not make interest payments on $40 million in loans from
subordinated bondholders.
   The company said it is not making these payments in order to
strengthen its cash position so that it can pay its trade and
operating expenses during the financial restructuring.
   It said it also is seeking an equity investor.
   The plan also includes the proposed sale of DAP Inc., a producer
of caulks and other specialty chemical products. DAP had annual
sales of $186 million in 1989, with an operating profit of $12
million.
   For the first nine months of 1990, USG lost $2 million while
sales skidded 6 percent, to $1.6 billion from $1.7 billion.
   ``The decision to begin financial restructuring now, rather than
simply seeking short-term amendments to our bank loan covenants, is
dictated by the continuing slowdown in construction markets,'' said
USG Chairman Eugene B. Connolly.

<TEXT>
   Federal authorities subpoenaed the records of
the nation's biggest baby formula manufacturers after state welfare
officials and consumer advocates made allegations of price fixing,
representatives of one of the companies and a professional
association said today.
   Officers of Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories and the American Academy
of Pediatrics said their records were subpoenaed several weeks ago
and they either had responded or were doing so.
   Debbie Feinstein, assistant to the director of the Federal Trade
Commission's Bureau of Competition, said the bureau began the
investigation late in May, at about the time its director, Kevin J.
Arquit, testified before a Senate subcommittee on the issue.
   Ms. Feinstein said she could not confirm that subpoenas had been
issued.
   ``This is a top-priority, front-burner investigation,'' Arquit
told The New York Times.
   He said authorities have not concluded that price fixing
occurred. The companies denied the allegations.
   The Times reported that records were subpoenaed from: Ross
Laboratories, a division of Abbott Laboratories; the Mead-Johnson
Nutritional Group, a division of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.;
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a division of the American Home Products
Corp.; the Carnation Co., a subsidiary of Nestle S.A.; and the
Gerber Products Co. The American Academy of Pediatrics was also
subpoenaed, it said.
   Ross, Mead-Johnson and Wyeth-Ayerst account for about 95 percent
of all baby formula marketed in the United States, while Carnation
and Gerber account for about 5 percent, the newspaper said. The
domestic market is worth about $1.3 billion a year, it said.
   Wyeth-Ayerst spokeswoman Audrey Ashby said the company received
the FTC subpoena in September and has begun turning over the
requested documents.
   ``We set prices independently and compete vigorously and
independently in all aspects of the infant formula business,'' Ms.
Ashby said. She said she had no further information on the
investigation.
   Efforts to get comment from other companies were not immediately
successful. There was no answer this morning at Bristol-Myers
Squibb, and a woman answering the telephone at Gerber Products Co.
in Fremont, Mich., said all corporate offices are closed until
Wednesday.
   In Washington, Antoinette Parisi Eaton, president of the
American Academy of Pediatrics, confirmed that records of the
academy, mainly its policy statements in opposition to infant
formula advertising, had been subpoenaed. She said the academy
responded to the subpoena about six weeks ago.
   ``Our position has been that we are speaking out and have an
obligation to speak out in the best interests of the public health
of infants in this country,'' Ms. Eaton said. ``Our concern is that
breast feeding will be reduced by infant formula advertising.
Breast feeding rates in this country are already going down.''
   Ms. Feinstein said, ``We are not taking a position on whether or
not advertising is good or bad or infant formula is good or bad,
but the things we have heard are that infant formula is a very
concentrated industry and one of the reasons it might be hard for
people to enter is because there is not any advertising.''
   At a hearing held by the antitrust subcommittee of the Senate
Judiciary Committee in May, Democratic Sens. Howard Metzenbaum of
Ohio and Patrick Leahy of Vermont charged that three companies used
nearly total control of the infant formula market to keep prices
high and rebates to state-run programs for poor children low. The
companies named were Mead Johnson, Ross Laboratories and Wyeth
Laboratories. Industry officials said their prices were fair.
   Infant formula is a major ingredient in food packages given to
low-income families who qualify for the Special Supplemental Food
Program for Women, Infants and Children. The program serves about
4.4 million people a month and accounts for one-third of the infant
formula sold in the United States.
   The program's funds are limited and higher costs mean fewer
people benefit, Arquit said.
   Dennis H. Bach of Iowa, who heads the National Association of
WIC directors, said baby formula prices ``have seemed to go up in
lock step over the last 10 years.''
   Betsy Clarke, director of the WIC program in Oregon, said prices
have tripled during the past 15 years, with different companies
raising prices by the same amounts within days of each other.
   Current retail prices range from $1.80 to $2.30 for a 13-ounce
can of concentrated formula.

   Grains closed lower and soybeans were higher
Monday at the close of an abbreviated pre-holiday session on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans bounced back from sharp losses on Friday, when futures
prices dipped to new contract lows, reflecting expectations for
heavy deliveries this week.
   The complex posted moderate gains after commercial firms
reported an unexpectedly low number of deliveries, said Victor
Lespinasse, assistant vice president for grains for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   ``There really was not much news or anything of consequence
except that deliveries were much lighter than expected,''
Lespinasse said.
   Wheat gained on early support from soybeans and word that the
U.S. Agriculture Department is subsidizing some wheat purchases. It
later fell, however, amid a flurry of professional selling.
   Corn had some support from wheat and soybeans but later was
weighed down by light export demand.

   To some, the welfare systems in northern Europe
are the world's most humane. To others, they're a wasteful gravy
train, supporting thousands of people who could work if they had
to. Now, an economic downturn is threatening the generous systems
and some people living off them will feel the pinch.

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of Northern Europe's welfare
states wonder how to keep their cradle-to-grave safety nets from
fraying in the impending recession.
   In the post-World War II boom years, the Scandinavian countries,
the Netherlands and West Germany introduced programs that spend up
to a quarter of the gross national product on welfare.
   Welfare spending now is outstripping the industrial growth that
was supposed to pay the bill. With growth slowing in many European
countries, some governments are considering cutbacks.
   With less money available for welfare, government officials
complain more loudly about people abusing the system.
   Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers says his nation's welfare
system, which will cost the government 132.3 billion guilders
($79.6 billion) in 1991, is out of hand.
   In a recent report, the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, citing Holland's high income taxes and generous
welfare benefits, concluded that incentives to work are low. The
nation has an 11 percent unemployment rate.
   Dutch authorities recently failed to lure jobless Amsterdam
residents to the understaffed flower industry, even after the
government offered a car for every four workers to use for
commuting, as well as personal use.
   Denmark spends 40 percent of its budget on the 1.4 million
people - 28 percent of the population - who live on welfare. The
center-right coalition government of Prime Minister Poul Schlueter
hopes it can reduce welfare dependency by stimulating private
industry.
   Denmark has 20,000 people under 40 years of age getting
permanent government pensions of 3,709 kroner ($662) a month
because of drug or alcohol problems.
   In Europe, welfare helps the employed as well as the jobless.
The system commonly includes free medical insurance, sick pay,
disability and old age pensions, and child-care and unemployment
benefits.
   In Sweden, parents can qualify for benefits for taking time off
to nurse a sick child.
   ``The basic thing is that everyone should have basic
opportunities to ... take part in all activities within our
society,'' said Annchristen Filipson of the Swedish Social Affairs
Ministry.
   Scandinavian taxpayers can hardly be expected to dig deeper in
their pockets to pay a greater share of the welfare costs. Their
tax rates of more than 50 percent already are highest in the
industrialized world.
   Last October, Sweden's ruling Social Democratic Party made the
first cuts ever in a social welfare system now costing 251.39
billion kronor ($45.13 billion), just over one-fifth of the GNP.
   The government is expected to cut 15 billion kronor ($2.69
billion dollars) from the welfare budget in 1991. The government is
also planning to cut sick pay rates from 100 percent to 75 percent
of a worker's salary for the first three days in an effort to
discourage malingering. Workers take an average 25 days of sick
leave a year.
   The welfare programs are usually funded by taxes paid by
employers and employees, and some are getting fed up.
   Ove Danemar of the Swedish Employers' Federation criticized
``the whole system'' because ``it stimulates people to work less
and to take more leisure time.
   ``The private sector can't bear it any longer,'' he said. ``It's
no longer consistent with a modern economy.''
   Critics say many of the benefits were begun in good faith but
have ended up being abused. During more favorable economic times,
the abuse was widely tolerated. But with the Continent entering a
recession, there is more clamping down on wasteful spending.
   Lubbers has vowed to curb Holland's Unsuitability for Work Act,
under which nearly 900,000 people get life-long disability pensions
of up to 70 percent of their last-earned pay. In the late 1970s,
some companies used it by dismissing unproductive employees,
passing the social cost on to the government.
   About one-third of the program's beneficiaries claim
psychological reasons for being unable to work. In a recent speech,
Lubbers said wryly: ``Looking at the statistics ... one has to
admit that ours is a sick nation.''
   This spring, the Dutch government is expected to make deep cuts
in the housing, education and cultural subsidies that complement
the welfare handouts, themselves equal to at least 70 percent of
the minimum wage. It has borrowed heavily and diverted money from
other programs to cover welfare costs.
   Only Germany is making large welfare increases, to pay millions
of former East Germans who are unemployed.
   Norway is slightly expanding its 125.8 billion kroner ($21
billion) welfare system, on which almost a quarter of the
population depends in some form or other. The Labor government has
added about one billion kroner ($166 million) to the bill since
coming into office last month and even the right-leaning opposition
Progress Party favors the expansion.

<TEXT>
   A new front in Singapore's war on smoking opens
New Year's Day when duty-free cigarettes will no longer be sold to
passengers arriving at the airport.
   Covering foreign visitors as well as citizens, the ban is part
of a campaign to make this island of 2.7 million people a nation of
non-smokers.
   It is also part of a growing drive in Asia against tobacco
companies, which have been accused of targeting women and children.
Some U.S. tobacco companies, facing declining domestic sales, have
stepped up efforts to increase exports to the region.
   No breakdown was available on cigarette sales to passengers
arriving at Changi Airport since the same outlets also serve
passengers changing flights. Duty-free cigarettes sold aboard
incoming aircraft are not affected, nor those bought by passengers
bound for overseas.
   As a blow against tobacco, the ban is not as sweeping as many
past moves in Singapore, which already has the region's toughest
controls.
   Smoking already is barred in restaurants, supermarkets,
department stores, museums, pool halls, public bathrooms,
libraries, indoor sports arenas and other public halls, cinemas,
fast-food outlets, taxis, buses, subways, government offices,
hospitals and clinics. Violators face a $289 fine.
   Smoking is is frowned upon but not yet against the law in
private offices and clubs.
   Smokers may light up in bars, but only during hours in which no
food is served.
   Singapore Airlines, which barred smoking on short flights in
1988, extended the ban in October to all regional flights of four
hours or less.
   Tobacco advertising has been prohibited in Singapore media since
1970. Another law last New Year's Day barred the display of
point-of-sale ads for cigarettes in stores.
   Cigarette names and trademarks also are banned from motor
vehicles, souvenirs and gifts. Free cigarette samples are illegal
and tobacco products cannot be given as prizes in lotteries or
other contests.
   Manufacturers must rotate four different health warnings on
their packs quarterly: ``Smoking causes heart disease,'' ``Smoking
causes cancer,'' ``Smoking damages your lungs'' and ``Smoking harms
those around us.''
   ``The most important strategy against lung cancer is avoidance
of smoking,'' Health Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said recently in
announcing the duty-free sales curb.
   The lung cancer incidence rate increased from 18 cases per
100,000 people in 1972 to about 30 per 100,000 in 1987, he said.
   Smokers are believed to comprise only 13.6 percent of the
population age 15 and above. But health experts were dismayed to
discover an increase recently in the number of smokers between ages
15 and 19.
   Tobacco companies joined the campaign this year to discourage
youngsters from smoking.
   ``We are not here to promote smoking to children but to provide
the choice to adults who want to smoke,'' said Richard Png,
executive director of the Tobacco Manufacturers and Importers
Association.
   Posters bearing the message ``Children, don't smoke'' were
distributed to 8,000 retail outlets.
   Other nations in the region also have cracked down on smoking.
Indonesia last month banned smoking in primary and secondary
schools. Hong Kong stopped televised cigarette ads Dec. 1. Hong
Kong's legislature has urged the government to ban children under
the age of 15 from smoking in restaurants.
   Malaysian Airlines, Philippine Airlines and Pakistan
International Airlines forbid smoking on domestic flights.
   The World Health Organization says nine of the 10 countries
where smoking is most widespread are in the Asia-Pacific region. It
warned that more women and young people are lighting up in this
area despite the spread of lung cancer and other tobacco-related
diseases.
   Papua New Guinea, where 85 percent of men and 80 percent of
women smoke, tops the WHO list. The others are Fiji, Nepal, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, South Korea, Japan and China.

<HEAD>Saudis Say Gulf-Crisis Costs Eating Up Money</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Military costs in the Persian Gulf
crisis have outrun Saudi Arabia's extra revenue derived from higher
petroleum prices and production, the government said Monday.
   The kingdom said it was delaying promulgation of its 1991 budget
because the uncertainty created by the crisis has made it difficult
to project how much revenue it will get from oil.
   The world's largest oil exporter said the financial burdens it
had to bear because of the emergency circumstances create by
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of neighboring Kuwait were ``much more''
than the extra oil revenues.
   Under the 1990 budget, which took effect last Dec. 31, the
government revenues were forecast at 118 billion riyals or about
$31.4 billion. Expenditures were set at 143 billion riyals or $37.6
billion.
   The difference of 25 billion riyals was to be covered through
issuing government development bonds.
   In a statement to the official Saudi Press Agency, Information
Minister Ali al-Shaer said ``Iraq's flagrant aggression'' on Kuwait
and the threats it posed to Saudi territories have led the
government to reinforce its military and upgrade services and
public utilities.
   ``The presence of sisterly and friendly forces has also entailed
extra spending on the services and infrastructure needed by these
forces,'' Shaer said.
   The statement said the rise of oil prices, which have increased
to the $28-$30 a barrel range from less than $22 prior to the
crisis, have helped the government's added expenses. During part of
October, oil briefly surpassed the $40 a barrel level.
   However, the increase in expenditures for the Saudis due to the
Gulf crisis ``was much more than the increase in petroleum
revenues,'' said Shaer, without giving further details.
   The statement said it was difficult to assess anticipated
revenues because of the unpredictability of circumstances that will
decide the level of production and prices during the next 12
months.
   The United Nations has set a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait.
   Saudi oil production has risen to around 8 million barrels a
day, from around 5.4 million barrels a day earlier in the year.
   But Saudi leader King Fahd noted recently that his grade of oil
never hit the $40-a-barrel figure in the first two months of the
invasion, which was for actively-traded U.S. and North Sea grades
of oil.
   He said his best grades never exceeded $26 a barrel and his
heavier crude oil sold for as low as $15 a barrel.
   Saudi Arabia has agreed tound $8 billion to the costs of the
multinational military deployment opposing the Iraqis. Most of that
force has come from the United States.
   Economists at the Bahrain-based Gulf International Bank have
calculated that the Gulf crisis has cost Saudi Arabia around $21
billion, compared with extra revenues of $16 billion.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USG Corp. said the anemic construction industry
is forcing it to defer debt payments, restructure finances and sell
a major subsidiary.
   The company, one of the nation's largest building products
manufacturers, said it would not make a $105 million payment on
principal that was due Monday, putting it technically in default
and subject to court action by lenders.
   USG said, however, that major bank lenders have agreed to go
along with the restructuring plan while it continues to make
interest payments on the $105 million.
   The company also said it will not make interest payments due
Jan. 15 on $40 million worth of bonds.
   Spokesman Matthew Gonring said officials will be in contact with
the major bondholders, but he declined to say if USG has sought
assurances that the bondholders will not file bankruptcy petitions
against the company.
   The company said in a statement that it does not intend to file
for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.
   ``An out-of-court restructuring is the best solution ...,'' the
company said.
   The USG announcement reflected a steep downturn in demand for
construction of homes and commercial real estate that has gripped
much of the country. Sales of new homes, for example, are now at
their lowest levels since the 1981-82 recession, with little
improvement expected anytime soon.
   USG lost $2 million during the first nine months of 1990 while
sales skidded 6 percent, to $1.6 billion from $1.7 billion.
   In the past two years, the company has laid off 1,100 workers
because of economic difficulties. Additional employees were lost in
the sales of subsidiaries.
   USG said that as part of its restructuring it will offer for
sale DAP Inc., a producer of caulks and other specialty hemical
products. DAP had annual sales of $186 million in 1989, with an
operating profit of $12 million.
   USG said it also is seeking an investor willing to give the
company a major infusion.
   ``We believe there are a number of investors who might be
interested in making an equity investment in the company,'' Gonring
said, adding that there have been talks with potential investors.
He didn't identify any.
   The company said its cash position at year-end is ``very strong
and that it will pay its trade and operating expenses in a timely
manner throughout the restructuring process.''
   It said it is not making the loan payments in order to assure
liquidity during restructuring, which it expects to complete before
the end of 1991.
   ``The decision to begin financial restructuring now, rather than
simply seeking short-term amendments to our bank loan covenants, is
dictated by the continuing slowdown in construction markets,'' said
USG Chairman Eugene B. Connolly.
   The company has retained Salomon Brothers and Lazard Freres
investment banking firms to help in the restructuring.

<HEAD>Business Execs Top Most Powerful Sports Figure List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His name doesn't show up in the daily box
scores, but CBS Inc. Chairman Laurence A. Tisch landed the top spot
in one magazine's new listing of the most powerful figures in
sport.
   The Sporting News leaned toward businessmen like Tisch, who has
agreed to spend almost $3.9 billion on acquiring the rights to
broadcast major sporting events on the CBS Television Network, in
assmbling its list.
   Only three athletes - golfers Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer
and basketball standout Michael Jordan - were chosen for the
100-member roster.
   Ranking second to Tisch was Dick Ebersol, president of NBC
Sports, followed by the commissioners of three major professional
sports: Paul Tagliabue of the National Football League, Fay Vincent
of major league baseball and David Stern of the National Basketball
Association.
   The full list appears in the Jan. 7 issue of the weekly sports
publication that goes on newstands on Wednesday.
   Sporting News said in a statement that the ranking of entrants
was determined by the editorial staff. It did not elaborate on the
selection process.
   But Editor John Rawlings was quoted as saying the list ``clearly
indicates that the real muscle of sports lies not with the athletes
but with the behind the scenes power brokers.''
   Under Tisch, CBS has agreed to pay almost $3.9 billion for
sports broadcast rights, including $1.06 billion for major league
baseball, a similar amount for National Football League games, more
than $1.2 billion for college basketball and football and $543
million for the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympic Games.
   Tisch's competitors at the other networks have argued that CBS
offered to pay much more for the broadcast rights than the network
could reasonably expect to recover in advertising sales from the
programs.
   CBS has contended that the high-profile sporting events will
give it a chance to promote its other shows to a large audience.
   The company recently announced it lost $55 million after taxes
on its first year of baseball and would charge another $115 million
against earnings to reflect anticipated losses in the next three
years of the baseball contract.
   ``There's no doubt Tisch's actions have changed the face of
sports,'' Rawlings said.
   ``For better or worse, the acquisition of major broadcast
properties by CBS will have a domino effect on the entire sports
industry - including athletes, owners, fans, agents, advertisers
and all other parties - for years to come,'' he said.
   He said the effect of higher rights payments is reflected in
more revenue for sports owners, bigger salaries for players,
steeper ticket prices for fans and rescheduled game tmes to suit
television's need for large audiences.
   Rounding out the top 10 members of the list is Mark McCormack,
head of International Management Group, a sports agency and
promotion firm; Dennis Swanson, ABC Sports president; Juan Antonio
Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee; boxing
promoter Don King and Donald Dell, founder of the sports management
firm ProServ.
   Only two women appear on the list - No. 29 Ellen Merlo, vice
president of marketing services at Philip Morris whose brands
Marlboro and Virginia Slims cigarettes and Miller beer are major
sports sponsors and advertisers, and No. 31 Anita DeFrantz,
president of the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles and the
first black woman named to the International Olympic Committee.
   The three athletes on the list have connections to business and
sports.
   Nicklaus, who ranked 61st, is a golf course designer and
manufacturer as well as a golfer. Jordan, who placed 79th, has
appeared in a number of product commercials for cereal, shoes and
fast food. The golfer Palmer, ranked 93rd, is a course designer and
entrepreneur.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were unchanged to lower in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $10.02 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 6.52 percent, the same as in the
last auction on Dec. 21. Another $10.04 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.48 percent, down
from 6.57 percent on Dec. 21.
   The rate on three-month bills was last lower when they sold for
6.51 percent on June 20, 1988. The six-month rate was the lowest
since May 2, 1988, when it averaged 6.41 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
- 6.72 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,835.20 and 6.79 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,670.60.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 6.95
percent last week, down from 6.96 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Bond Prices End Year Up In Quiet Trading</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices closed higher in quiet trading
Monday, while the rate for overnight loans between banks skidded
sharply after the Federal Reserve moved to offset a predicted
short-term credit crunch.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 11-16 point, or
$6.88 per $1,000 in face amount, at closing Monday. Its yield,
which falls when prices rise, was 8.24 percent, down from 8.30
percent late Friday.
   Yields for the 30-year bond posted a slight gain in 1990, ending
up about \ percentage point above 1989's closing figure of 7.97
percent.
   The federal funds rate, the bank overnight loan rate and a
closely followed indicator of the Fed's activities, fluctuated
throughout the day.
   Economists attributed the swings to the Fed's injection of funds
into the banking system on Thursday and Monday to ease a projected
drought in short-term credit.
   ``The Fed seems to have bent over backwards to provide reserves
to the banking system,'' said Douglas McAllister, a bond trader for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The rate fluctuated in a range of 6 percentage points but didn't
skyrocket as some economists had expected. It traded around 2
percent late Monday, down from 7{ percent late Friday, according to
the Telerate Inc. financial information service.
   At the end of the year, banks aggressively borrow short-term
funds to shore up their balance sheets - a practice known as
``window dressing.'' This sudden surge of banks' short-term
borrowing can causes the fed funds rate to jump dramatically based
on the simple dynamics of supply and demand.
   The intense appetite for fed funds pushed the rate to 100
percent briefly Wednesday night, said Carol Stone, senior economist
for Nomura Securities International Inc. The Fed's perceived target
for the rate is 7 percent.
   The wild swings didn't surprise bond analysts.
   ``It is nothing out of the ordinary this time of year to get
those wild gyrations,'' said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist
for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Traders offered a range of explanations for the rise in bond
prices. Some felt the market was correcting itself following a
sharp sell-off Friday based on an erroneous report of shots fired
in the Persian Gulf.
   Others felt the bond rallied on news of a European peace
initiative in the gulf crisis.
   But Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist for Fuji Securities Inc.,
said that with such light trading, ``I would caution into reading
too much into one day's numbers.''
   Trading concluded at 3 p.m., earlier than normal because of the
New Year's holiday on Tuesday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term
maturities rose 3-16 point to 9-32 point, intermediate maturities
rose &rsqb; point to 7-16 point and long-term issues were up 17-32 point
to 11-16 point, Telerate Inc. reported.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, rose 3.16 to 1,184.10. The index fell 4.31
points in 1990.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills held at 6.62 percent as the
discount rose 1 basis point to 6.44 percent. Yields on six-month
bills were down to 6.71 percent as the discount fell 12 basis point
to 6.42 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 6.80 percent as
the discount fell 10 basis points to 6.39 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 1-32 point to 91 9-32. The average
yield to maturity held at 7.47 percent, unchanged from Friday. The
index is down from the 1989 closing rate of 93 14-32.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Advance in Light Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices closed out a tumultuous year by
advancing Monday in light and abbreviated trading dominated once
again by concerns about the Middle East.
   The February contract for light, sweet crude, the benchmark
grade of U.S. oil, rose 87 cents to $28.44 a 42-gallon barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, and subsequent months posted
similar gains.
   Monday's session ended early as traders left for the New Year's
holiday.
   Analysts reported the market was preoccupied with the Middle
East and the possibility that war could break out if Iraq has not
withdrawn from Kuwait before the Jan. 15 deadline set by the U.N.
Security Council.
   Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc., said the market shrugged off a planned peace initiative by
the European Community and focused instead on the ``fast
approaching'' deadline.
   Traders fear that a war in the Middle East would disrupt oil
supplies from the area. As tensions in the area have increased in
recent months, so have oil prices.
   On Aug. 1, the day before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, light,
sweet crude closed at $21.54 a barrel. It then rocketed $1.57
higher to close at $23.11 on Aug. 2 and began to fluctuate wildly
in the following weeks, with price changes of $1 or more becoming
the norm.
   The price of crude peaked at $40.42 a barrel on Oct. 12 before
retreating to its current level. Crude oil prices had ended 1989 at
$21.82 a barrel
   Prices for refined products have advanced in response to the
gains posted by crude. On Monday, heating oil and gasoline prices
also moved higher on technical factors as the January contracts for
each fuel expired.
   The January contract for heating oil rose 1.53 cents to settle
at 81.31 cents a gallon, and later months also advanced sharply.
   Heating oil has traded lower than might be expected for this
time of the year because of the unusually warm fall and winter.
Although temperatures have fallen in many parts of the country,
heating oil supplies are adequate and this has kept prices down,
Lebow said.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery picked up 1.36
cents to close at 70.92 cents a gallon, with subsequent months also
moving higher.
   In natural gas trading, the February contract closed at $1.950
per 1,000 cubic feet, unchanged from Friday.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends 1990 Lower; Gold Up Slightly But Down for the Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID E. KALISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mostly lower on the final day
of 1990, finishing a year of marked weakening against other
currencies due in large part to the reunification of Germany and a
slumping U.S. economy.
   Gold was marginally higher on Monday, but ended the year down
moderately. The metal closed up 20 cents to $394.20 a troy ounce
from Friday's close on the New York Commodity Exchange. That
compared with the gold's last quote on the final day of 1989,
$402.50 an ounce.
   Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $393.25 a troy
ounce, up 25 cents from late Friday but down from 1989's last late
bid of $402.50 an ounce.
   Currency analysts said the loosening of communism in Eastern
Europe also contributed to the dollar's fall by strengthening the
German mark.
   ``Germany is the big story in 1990,'' said David Marshall,
currency analyst at MMS International. ``The dollar did worse than
people expected it due to the quickness with which the
reunification of Germany went through and the strength of the
unwinding of Eastern Europe.''
   In addition, he said, ``no one expected the U.S. economy to be
as soft as it now seems to be.''
   On Monday in New York, the dollar closed against the German mark
at 1.4885 compared with 1.6950 marks at 1989's end. Late Friday the
dollar was quoted at 1.4935 marks.
   Analysts said the dollar's year-to-date loss against currencies
other than the mark was not as pronounced, in part because the
Middle East conflict seemed to hurt some other denominations more
than the dollar.
   In New York, the dollar ended the year at 135.50 Japanese yen,
down from 143.85 yen at the end of 1989. But Monday's dollar ended
stronger than Friday's closing 134.90 yen.
   The British pound also strengthened overall against the dollar,
closing the year at $1.9345 in New York compared with $1.6105 at
1989's close. On Friday, sterling was quoted at a closing $1.9282.
In London, the pound rose to $1.9280 from $1.9220 late Friday. The
pound traded in London for $1.6115 at the end of 1989.
   The dollar's slight fall on Monday was due partly to a fresh
peace initiative from the European Community. Luxembourg's foreign
minister, Jacques Poos, said he may meet with Iraqi counterpart
Tariq Aziz. Luxembourg will take over the European Community's
rotating chairmanship on Tuesday.
   Heightened peace prospects in the Persian Gulf tend to diminish
the dollar's value because the investment is considered a safe
haven in times of war.
   Despite the EEC's peace-feeling foray, earlier news of a
hostile-sounding New Year's message from Iraq's Saddam Hussein
offset much of the dollar's fall, said Marshall.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.65 Japanese yen to 135.40 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 135.55 yen. The dollar finished
at 143.40 yen in Tokyo at the end of 1989.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates and with 1989 yearend rates in parentheses included: 1.2668
Swiss francs, down from 1.2745 (1.5420); 5.0685 French francs, down
from 5.0810 (5.7805); 1.1599 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1601
(1.1588); 1,122.75 Italian lire, down from 1,126.50 (1,267.00).
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late rates
Friday and with 1989 yearend rates in parentheses included: 1.4965

   The stock market edged upward today just before
the close of the final session of an uninspired year.
   Activity was light throughout the session in a holiday
atmosphere.
   The markets will be closed on Tuesday for New Year's before
starting 1991 on Wednesday.
   Analysts said traders felt little urgency to make any fresh
commitments, pending developments in the weeks ahead on the
showdown in the Persian Gulf.
   Stocks didn't get much benefit from declining interest rates in
the credit markets. Prices of long-term government bonds rose more
than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the
neighborhood of 8.24 percent.

   Instability in Europe, the threat of war in the
Middle East and economic woes everywhere pushed world stock markets
down sharply in 1990, and strategists said the new year hinges on
the course of those events.
   In major markets, Japan tumbled on overvalued stocks and high
interest rates and Germany sank as the effect of abosorbing its
formerly Communist eastern neighbor set in, while Britain benefited
from a weak dollar.
   According to an index of 20 major markets by Morgan Stanley
Capital International, world stock markets tumbled 23 percent in
1990 through Friday as measured in local currencies. The U.S.,
Canadian and British stock markets were open Monday, but most 1990
trading worldwide ended Friday.
   Excluding the United States and Canada, the decline for U.S.
investors playing foreign markets translated to 24.4 percent in
1990, compared to a 9.1 percent increase in dollar terms in 1989,
Morgan Stanley said.
   ``Bascially we had a year where the consequences of high real
interest rates came out,'' said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist
with Barclays de Zoete Wedd. He said higher rates in Germany and
Japan were felt worldwide.
   Market strategists said Monday that the world developments that
shaped 1990 will spill over as the dominant themes of 1991. Among
the key questions:
   -Will the United States go to war with Iraq? Rising oil prices
had a bad inflationary effect on equity markets from Stockholm to
Singapore, and trading closely followed the movements of oil
prices.
   -How bad will the world financial crisis get? The pace of
slowdowns in Europe and Japan and recessions in the Britain and the
United States, and the movement of interest rates, particularly in
Germany, are considered keys to stock market performance in 1991.
   -Will the tinder box politics of the Soviet Union ignite? Will
Eastern Europe become more than an economic drain for the West?
Economists said the potential for quick gains there is slim, but
that disaster could depress stock markets.
   In the Morgan Stanley index, Japan's stock market dropped 39.9
percent in yen terms in 1990, the world's second worst performance
behind a 40.2 percent fall in Finland. Germany declined 20.9
percent, France fell 25.2 percent and Italy lost 29 percent in
their local currencies.
   The declines were smaller when measured in U.S. dollars, which
fell against European currencies for the year.
   The best performer in local terms was the Hong Kong market,
which rose 4.6 percent. The Austrian market lost just 6.9 percent
in local currency and rose 4.9 percent in dollar terms. Britain
dropped 10.7 percent in pounds and rose 6.1 percent in dollars. The
U.S. market was down 5.9 percent, according to Morgan Stanley.
   In Japan, the Nikkei index of 225 leading stocks plunged from a
record high of 38,915.87 at the end of 1989 to below 20,000 after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August. The index recovered somewhat
to end the year at 23,848.71.
   A sharp rise in Japanese interest rates helped depress equity
investment there, Hoey said. That combined with what was widely
considered an unsustainable market level spurred the sell-off.
Major factors in 1991 are the real estate prices and whether
economic malaise will increase.
   Interest rates played the primary role in Germany, with the
powerful Bundesbank, the nation's central bank, dictating action in
other European capitals.
   The Frankfurt stock market soared in the spring amid optimism
over Eastern Europe before the cost of German reunification took
its toll. The German government hiked interest rates to offset the
inflationary impact of pouring billions of dollars into former East
Germany.
   Higher interest rates dampen corporate expansion and economic
growth generally.
   ``It's almost as if they flew an airplane over East Germany and
threw deutsche marks out the window,'' Hoey said. ``The consequence
was a widening budget deficit, increased financing pressure and the
anti-inflationary response of the Bundesbank.''
   Smaller foreign markets were affected by the interest rate rise.
The Netherlands' stock market, for instance, lost 17.4 percent in
1990 in local terms, according to Morgan Stanley. The U.S.
recession also damped enthusiasm for investing in companies that do
business in the United States.
   ``The Dutch have a saying - when it rains outside Holland they
too sometimes get a little wet,'' said Palmer Davidsen, who watches
the Dutch market for ABN-AMRO Securities New York, a subsidiary of
a Dutch bank.
   ``People are starting to think twice about buying stocks that
have big dollar exposure or big economic exposure (in the United
States),'' she said.
   Also, the widely hoped-for benefits of investment in the
emerging democracies of Eastern Europe didn't materialize for
European companies, analysts said. They said improvements there
could help European markets, but warned that political instability
in the Soviet Union could trigger a world financial crisis.

<HEAD>Soybeans, Precious Metals, Energy Future Higher</HEAD>

   Soybeans staged a moderate comeback Monday on the Chicago Board
of Trade amid an unexpectedly low number of deliveries during an
abbreviated pre-holiday session.
   On other markets, energy futures gained; precious metal futures
were slightly higher; livestock and meat futures were mostly lower;
and grains slipped. The markets had shortened New Year's Eve
sessions.
   Soybeans futures prices settled 0.5 cent lower to 4.5 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in January at $5.61{ a
bushel.
   Soybeans bounced back from losses on Friday, when the future
dipped to new contract lows, reflecting expectations for heavy
deliveries this week.
   The complex posted moderate gains after commercial firms
reported only three million bushels delivered, as opposed to the 10
million expected, said Victor Lespinasse, assistant vice president
for grains for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``There really was not much news or anything of consequence
except that deliveries were much lighter than expected,''
Lespinasse said.
   Wheat gained on early support from soybeans and word that the
U.S. Agriculture Department will meet with officials from the
Soviet Union on Friday to subsidize some wheat purchases. It later
fell, however, amid a flurry of professional selling.
   Corn had some support from wheat and soybeans but later was
weighed down by light export demand.
   Wheat futures settled 2.25 cents lower to 0.25 cent higher with
March at $2.60{ a bushel; corn futures were 1 cent lower to
unchanged with March at $2.31} a bushel, oats were 2.5 cents to 0.5
cent lower with March at $1.10\ a bushel.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, energy futures showed a
higher-than-expected level of activity as tension mounted over
U.N.'s Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to unconditionally withdraw from
neighboring Kuwait.
   War rhetoric from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein also contributed
to the gains.
   Light sweet crude settled 10 cents to 91 cents higher with
February at $28.44 a barrel; heating oil settled 1.29 cents to 2
cents higher with January at 81.31 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline settled .90 cent to 1.36 cents higher with January at
70.92 cents a gallon; and natural gas was unchanged to .02 higher
with February at $1.950 per cubic feet.
   Gold and silver settled slightly higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange as traders squared their books for the start of the new
year, analysts said.
   Gold settled unchanged to 20 cents higher with January at
$394.20 an ounce; silver settled .30 cent to .20 cent higher with
January at $4.19 an ounce.
   ``There was very little trading range,'' said Frederick Demler,
an analyst for Paine Webber Inc. ``There was a little concern about
the gulf crisis, but it was mainly book-squaring at the end of the
year.''
   ``Precious metals also were supported by a slight easing of the
U.S. dollars,'' added Bette Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst at
Prudential Bache Securities Inc.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. A weak tone in the beef industry was the cause
of sluggish trading. Pork futures were awaiting this weekend's
release of the government's quarterly hogs and pigs report.
   Cattle futures prices settled unchanged to .20 cent higher with
February at 77.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower
to .23 cent higher with January at 89.40 cents a pound; hogs were
.32 cent lower to .25 cent higher with February at 48.87 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent lower to unchanged with
February at 63.10 cents a pound.

   The number of bank and savings institution
failures declined in 1990 for the first time in seven years, but
the foundering economy may prevent any sustained improvement.
   In 1990, 169 commercial and savings banks failed, including one
bank that remained open only with an infusion of government cash,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Monday.
   Additionally, 211 savings and loans went insolvent, the
Resolution Trust Corp. said. That included 207 seized by the
government and put into conservatorship and four kept open with
taxpayer money.
   The failure total in 1990 - 380 - represents a 29 percent drop
from 535 in 1989, a post-Depression high. It marks the first
decline since 1983, when 84 of both types of institutions failed,
compared with 105 the previous year.
   Analysts, however, are drawing no encouragement from the
improvement. The sharp deterioration in real estate values,
particularly in New England and New York and New Jersey, have yet
to make their full impact on the failure rate, they said. Nor have
the effects of the economic slowdown since the summer.
   ``1990 in a way was really a lull year,'' said financial
institutions analyst Bert Ely of Alexandria, Va. ``Every indication
is that in 1991 we're going to see a significant increase.''
   The geographic pattern of failures shows they reflect old
problems from the mid-1980s in oil-producing states in the
Southwest rather than new problems in the Northeastern states where
real estate markets are weakest, he said.
   Although 1990's failures were spread among 38 states and the
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, more than a third - 140 -
were in Texas.
   Ten other states had 10 or more failures. They were California
and Florida, 21 each; Illinois, 18; Louisiana, 17; New Jersey, 14;
Oklahoma, 13; New York, 12; Massachusetts and Colorado, 11, and
Mississippi, 10.
   ``What's going to be interesting in 1991 is to see what will
happen in New England. That's where the next wave of problems is,''
Ely said.
   According to economist Robert Litan of the Brookings
Institution, the most significant difference between bank problems
in the 1980s and bank problems of the 1990s is that this time some
of the nation's largest S&amp;Ls are under stress.
   ``Through the 1980s, the problems were largely concentrated in
small banks, with a few isolated exceptions,'' he said. ``Today the
weakness is concentrated in large banks.''
   That is reflected in FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman's forecast
that 180 banks will fail in 1991. Although that is only 10 more
than in 1990, the agency says assets held by the insolvent
institutions will total $70 billion, up from around $16 billion in
1990.
   The S&amp;Ls toppling into insolvency in 1990 had $117 billion in
assets. Meanwhile, according to the Office of Thrift Supervision,
an additional 184 institutions, with around $150 billion in assets,
are all but certain to fail and 356 S&amp;Ls with $190 billion in
assets are in danger of failing.
   If all of the endangered S&amp;Ls fold, only around 2,000
privately-managed S&amp;Ls would be left operating. If Seidman's bank
failure prediction proves accurate, the number of commercial and
savings banks operating would be reduced to around 12,700.
   The big danger, according to economists, is that regulators will
hesitate to seize failing institutions and sell them off to new
investors. Seidman said the FDIC has enough money to handle bank
failures through this year, but the insurance fund would begin 1992
dangerously diminished to around $4 billion.
   Seidman is proposing that healthy banks contribute around $25
billion to shore up the fund.
   Resolution Trust Corp. officials, meanwhile, estimate they will
be out of funds unless Congress expeditiously acts to provide more.
After spending most of the $50 billion that Congress appropriated
for the S&amp;L bailout in 1989, the Bush administration estimates it
needs at least another $40 billion to cover losses in 1990.
   The RTC spent $32 billion in 1990 to protect depositors in 320
S&amp;Ls, including some that were closed and others turned over to new
owners. That total includes institutions seized in 1989 as well as
in 1990.

   A last-minute round of buying carried stock
prices modestly higher Monday in the final session of an uninspired
year.
   Activity was light throughout the day in a holiday atmosphere.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.45 to 2,633.66,
closing out 1990 with a net loss of 119.54 points, or 4.3 percent.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,018 up, 596 down and 424 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 114.13 million
shares, against 111.04 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 151.25 million shares.
   Big Board volume for the year totaled 39.66 billion shares, the
lowest annual figure since 35.68 billion shares were traded in
1986.
   The markets will be closed on Tuesday for New Year's before
starting 1991 on Wednesday.
   Analysts said investors felt little urgency to make any big
commitments, pending developments in the weeks ahead on the
showdown in the Persian Gulf.
   Stocks didn't get much benefit from declining interest rates in
the credit markets. Prices of long-term government bonds rose more
than $5 for each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the
neighborhood of 8.24 percent.
   For most of the year, blue-chip stocks outperformed the much
larger ranks of smaller ``secondary'' issues. Broad-based market
indicators suffered 1990 percentage losses that were twice or three
times bigger than the Dow Jones industrial average's.
   But that order was reversed on Monday. Analysts said
professional traders appeared to be nibbling at a good many
depressed stocks in hopes of catching an early-1991 rally in this
sector of the market now that the pressure of yearend tax selling
has lifted.
   Among the top NYSE percentage gainers were such issues as Home
Shopping Network, up &rsqb; at 4; Bernard Chaus, up \ at 2&lsqb;; Dime
Savings Bank of New York, up \ at 2&rsqb;; USF&amp;G, up { at 7|, and CV
REIT Inc., up &rsqb; at 3.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up ~ at
51}; American Express, up \ at 20|; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,
up &lsqb; at 30&lsqb;, and Procter &amp; Gamble, up } at 86|.
   Precious-metals stocks were another strong spot. ASA Ltd. rose
1&rsqb; to 46~; Homestake Mining | to 19\, and Newmont Gold 1~ to 42{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $14.69 billion, or
0.48 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .84 to 180.49.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.16 to 387.42, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.50 at 330.22.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
2.64 to 373.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 308.11, up 3.46.

<TEXT>
   Western Union Corp., hoping to
avoid involuntary bankruptcy, completed a deal Monday to sell its
telex and electronic mail businesses to American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. for $180 million.
   Western Union will use the money to buy back some of its junk
bonds, helping ease its crushing interest-payment burden.
   Western Union's remaining operations are its money-transfer
service, electronic bill-paying service and electronic letter
services such as Mailgram.
   Western Union will buy back $335 million worth of its
high-interest, high-risk bonds at 50 cents on the dollar, the
company said. The buyback involves $329 million worth of 19\
percent notes and $6 million of 16 percent notes from investors who
accept the offer by Thursday.
   Western Union's debt will stand at $311 million after the bond
buyback.
   The transaction eases the threat of involuntary bankruptcy,
which has dogged the company since it missed a $51 million interest
payment in June, said Robert J. Amman, president and chief
executive officer. But it does not end its problems.
   ``We have made it clear to the company's creditors that further
refinancing of debt will be required in 1991,'' Amman said in a
news release. Company spokesman Warren R. Bechtel said that could
mean selling more assets, offering new deals to investors or
securing new financing.
   For the past seven years, Western Union's interest payments have
pushed the company into the red.
   Amman said the transaction with AT&amp;T was a turning point for
Western Union, one of the nation's oldest companies and a pioneer
in the telegram and telex businesses.
   ``With the sale ... the company is no longer a
telecommunications carrier and can focus its efforts on providing
value-added services in areas where its strengths can be brought to
bear most effectively - most notably our financial services
business, which includes the Western Union Money Transfer
services,'' Amman said.
   AT&amp;T plans to create a new unit combining business communication
services it previously offered with Western Union's telex and Easy
Link electronic mail services, said Linda Haertlein, an AT&amp;T
spokeswoman.
   ``The products we have, although essentially the same, have
separate customer bases, and have been focused to some extent on
different industries. We plan to continue both product lines and
eventually develop a new line that brings the best of the new lines
together,'' she said.
   Western Union is retaining its Priority Services division, which
provides Mailgram, priority letter and custom letter services.

   The New Year will bring tough economic times,
according to many forecasters who say 1991 will begin with America
in a mild recession that could cost an additional 1 million jobs.
   Inflation will moderate somewhat in 1991 according to these
estimates, and interest rates for mortgages, car loans and other
purchases should drift downward in the coming months.
   These economic forecasters express optimism that the recession
could end sometime in midyear.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal authorities investigating alleged
price fixing in the baby formula business have subpoenaed company
records and the files of an infant health group that opposes
formula advertising on grounds it would discourage breast feeding.
   Company officials said Monday the subpoenas were issued by the
Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition.
   Antoinette Parisi Eaton, president of the American Academy of
Pediatrics, said the records subpoenaed from the academy dealt
mainly with its position in opposition to infant formula
advertising.

   CHICAGO (AP) - USG Corp. said the anemic construction industry
is forcing it to defer debt payments, restructure finances and sell
a major subsidiary.
   The company, one of the nation's largest building products
manufacturers, said it would not make a $105 million payment on
principal that was due Monday, putting it technically in default
and subject to court action by lenders.
   USG said, however, that major bank lenders have agreed to go
along with the restructuring plan while it continues to make
interest payments on the $105 million.

sport.
   The Sporting News leaned toward businessmen like Tisch, who has
agreed to spend almost $3.9 billion on acquiring the rights to

affiliates for local use.
   Until now, the network had been feeding its affiliates several

   Lower prices were reported for milk, hogs and lettuce, although

of the other commodities.
   However, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said
fruit and vegetable prices were recorded before freezing cold hit
California around Dec. 21.
