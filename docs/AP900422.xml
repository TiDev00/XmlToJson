<HEAD>Wife of Pro-Solidarity Journalist Dies in Suspicious Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of a reporter who investigated
the secret police for a pro-Solidarity newspaper died Sunday after
leaping from the window of her burning apartment, the official PAP
news agency reported.
   A Solidarity official alleged the fire was arson, and the
government said it was investigating.
   The fire killed Maria Jachowicz, 49, but her husband, Jerzy, and
their 14-year-old daughter jumped from an apartment window and
escaped with slight injuries, the agency reported.
   Jerzy Jachowicz has written numerous articles for the
pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza about the workings of the
Interior Ministry, which controls the secret police in Poland.
   At Solidarity's national congress in Gdansk, delegate Michal
Boni said it appeared the fire had been set by arsonists and
proposed a resolution demanding an investigation into whether
officers from the Interior Ministry were responsible, PAP reported.
   The motion was sent to a congress committee for review, the
agency said.
   A statement from the press office of the Solidarity-led
government said an ``intensive investigation is being carried out
by the police'' and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki is being kept
informed of its course.
   Earlier this month, Parliament voted to eliminate the dreaded
secret police and to change the Interior Ministry into a smaller,
civilian-run office. It had previously been staffed by uniformed
functionaries along military lines and was considered part of the
national defense system.
   The secret police had monitored and harassed dissidents and even
ordinary citizens to maintain the Communist Party's grip on power
in Poland. The new Office of State Protection is to limit its
activities to fighting espionage and threats to national security.
   The secret police are suspected in scores of political killings
and four secret police were convicted in the 1984 kidnapping and
murder of pro-Solidarity priest Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko.
   The government has said the secret police force was reduced from
24,000 officers in June to 3,100 this year. Some reportedly took
early retirement while others were permitted to transfer to the
Citizens Militia after retraining.

   Custom officials have seized a truck
carrying seized steel tubes believed to be parts for a huge Iraqi
gun for firing missiles, Turkish newspapers reported Saturday.
   The Istanbul daily Hurriyet quoted Finance and Customs Minister
Adnan Kahveci as saying ``a massive investigation'' was under way
following the seizure.
   The tubes, discovered Wednesday in a truck at Kapikule near the
Bulgarian border, were sent to the Istanbul Technical University
for examination, the newspaper said.
   On Friday, Greek customs officials seized a huge cylinder that
it said Iraq ordered from Britain for an artillery system. Greece's
move came seven days after Britain also seized a shipment of steel
tubes headed for Iraq.
   Turkey officials questioned two people in connection with the
incident, but nationalties were not given, Hurriyet said.
   Hurriyet said authorities believed the confiscated parts
resembled those seized in England.
   After the Greek announcment Friday, the British company Walter
Somers Ltd. said it had shipped the tubes in two trucks, one of
which had been detained in Greece, the other in Turkey.
   Istanbul daily Cumhuriyet said the British government requested
the tubes be returned, but Turkey refused it on grounds of
international law.
   No other details were given in Turkish newspapers, and officials
could not immediately be reached to elaborate on Saturday's reports.
   British officials seized eight steel tubes on the Middlesbrough
docks in England on April 12. The tubes were parts for a gun that
would be 130 feet long with a bore of nearly 40 inches, British
customs officials said.
   The Iraqi government and the British manufacturer of the tubes,
Sheffield Forgemasters, have said they were designed for a
petrochemical plant. There was no immediate comment from Iraq on
the Greek shipment.
   Weapons experts have said a gun built from the parts confiscated
in Britain and Greece could fire nuclear or chemical missiles
hundreds of miles, far enough to reach Israel and Iran.
   Britain banned arms shipments to Iran and Iraq when the two
Middle Eastern countries were at war, and the ban remains in effect.

   Pro-Cuban guerrillas Saturday night freed a
prominent television executive was kidnapped in October in Lima,
police said.
   Hector Delgado Parker, owner of Peru's largest television and
radio network, was reported in good condition after being held more
than six months by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
   Police said Delgado Parker was released about 7:45 p.m. but
details of his release were not made available and it was not known
whether a ransom was paid.
   President Alan Garcia and Interior Minister Agustin Mantilla
visited Delgado Parker at his home in the fashionable Miraflores
suburb, five miles south of Lima.
   A videotaped message by a Tupac Amaru leader was broadcast by
Delgado Parker's Chanel 5 television station Wednesday night. An
announcer said the broadcast was one of the kidnappers' demands for
Delgado Parker's release.
   The guerrilla group began fighting Peru's government in 1984.
The group takes its name from an 18th century mestizo revolutionary
who fought to free Peru's highlands from Spanish colonial rule.
   The group operates mostly in areas of Peru's northern and
eastern jungle, and occasionally bombs banks, embassies and
government offices in Lima.

   Gymnast-actress Cathy Rigby was injured
when struck in the head by a sword during a performance of ``Peter
Pan.''
   It took ten stitches to close the wound the former Olympic
gymnast suffered during a flying sequence in the third act of the
play Friday night at the Midland Theater.
   ``That's why, I guess, you don't play with knives,'' Rigby said
in an interview Saturday before she appeared in a matinee.
   Rigby was suspended in the air to simulate flying during a fight
with Captain Hook when her sword hit the set and struck her in the
head near the temple, said Tom McCoy, her husband and producer.
   Rigby bled profusely from the wound, which eventually required
10 stitches, McCoy said. Rigby's head was bandaged, and she
returned within a minute for the final act, he said.
   ``I'm sure the audience thought it was very realistic,'' Rigby
said.
   As the blood flowed, Rigby said, she thought: ``How do we fake
this one? It's not like losing a line.''
   Two other characters, Cindy Robinson as Wendy and Holly Erwin as
Tiger Lily, finished Peter Pan's song while Rigby's wound was
quickly dressed offstage.
   ``It was like the Mike Tyson fight,'' McCoy said. ``We were
trying to get our Peter Pan patched up for Round 15. There was
blood everywhere.''
   ``The audience definitely knew Peter had been in a tough fight
with Captain Hook,'' McCoy said.
   After the show, Rigby was treated at the emergency room of St.
Luke's Hospital and released.

   Erte, whose pioneering art deco designs in
graphics, fashion and theater of the 1920s returned to popularity
in recent years, died Saturday, a hospital spokesman said. He was
97.
   Erte _ whose real name was Romain de Tirtoff _ was known as a
painter, sculptor, lithographer and set designer. He designed
costumes for the legendary dancer Anna Pavlova and the
performer-spy Mata Hari.
   The prolific artist designed every cover of Harper's Bazaar from
1915 to 1936.
   His most recent project was to design the sets for the Broadway
musical ``Stardust.'' Some of his other major designs for sets and
costumes included Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande'' and Racine's
``Phedre.''
   He was also well-known for the opulent clothes and sets he
designed for George White's ``Scandals,'' the Ziegfeld Follies and
the Folies Bergere.
   ``He was just a genius,'' said Harris Shapiro, president of the
Dyansen Corp. gallery chain in an interview in Los Angeles. ``I
think history will reflect a few years from now that he was one of
the greatest artists of the 20th century.''

   Frank J. Lausche, a former five-term governor
and U.S. senator who was one of Ohio's most unorthodox and
successful politicians, died Saturday of heart complications. He
was 94.
   Lausche lost his first two races _ for the Ohio House in 1922
and the Ohio Senate in 1924. In 1932, he was appointed judge of the
Cleveland Municipal Court. In 1941, he was elected mayor of
Cleveland, a post he held until his election in 1944 to the first
of five terms as governor.
   Lausche's long political career ended in 1968 with his defeat _
due mostly to a long-running feud with organized labor _ in the
Democratic primary for re-election to a third term in the U.S.
Senate.
   He was the only Ohio governor to be elected five times.
   A conservative Democrat, Lausche served in the state Senate, was
appointed a municipal court judge in Cleveland and was elected in
1941 mayor of that city. In 1944, he was elected to his first term
as governor.
   Although a Democrat, Lausche earned a reputation as an
independent who often ignored party positions and consistently
proved popular among independents and Republican voters.

   Horst Sindermann, a former high-ranking East
German Communist official and Parliament leader, died Friday of a
heart attack, the official ADN news agency said. He was 74.
   Sindermann was a member of the ruling party Politburo and
president of the Communist-dominated Parliament until November,
when mass demonstrations toppled the hard-line leadership.
   The son of a Dresden book printer, Sindermann was jailed for
eight months in 1933 for after joining a Communist youth group. He
was convicted of high treason in 1935 and spent the next 10 years
in Nazi prison camps until the end of World War II.
   After the victorious Allies divided Germany into East and West,
Sindermann served as editor of various Communist Party publications
and held regional party posts until named to the Politburo in 1967.
   Nine years later, he became president of Parliament and a member
of the former council of state.
   After the demonstrations that toppled former party leader Erich
Honecker, the Communist leaders who replaced him purged many
members of the old guard. Sindermann was stripped of power and
party membership in November.

   Lava flowing from Kilauea Volcano
swallowed two more homes Saturday, and an evacuation order was
expanded in this community threatened by the long eruption.
   A 40-foot-wide finger of lava, which destroyed three houses in
the Kalapana Gardens subdivision on Friday, set one house ablaze
about 11:20 a.m. Saturday, said Lanny Nakano, a Civil Defense
spokesman on Hawaii Island.
   Lava destroyed another home in the subdivision at 6 p.m.
Saturday, said Wendell Hatada, another Civil Defense spokesman.
   ``As long as the eruption continues, the threat is real to the
whole community,'' said Bruce Butts, another Civil Defense
spokesman.
   An evacuation order, issued a week ago for 25 homes in the
120-house subdivison, was extended Saturday to 24 more homes, Butts
said. A 24-hour alert remained in effect for about 40 other houses
in outlying areas.
   Kilauea lava has destroyed eight homes in April, including five
since Wednesday. So far, 87 homes have burned since the current
eruption began in January 1983, said Butts. The volcano has caused
more than $20 million in damage.
   Nearly all of Kilauea's daily output of 650,000 cubic yards of
lava was reaching Kalapana, and the eruption showed no signs of
easing, said Reggie Okamura of the U.S. Geological Survey's
Hawaiian Volcano Obervatory.
   Meanwhile, state Insurance Director Robin Campaniano said
insurance companies that cancel or fail to renew policies of
homeowners in the volcano-ravaged subdivision will be subject to
fines or loss of their licenses.
   Also on Saturday, Mount Redoubt in Alaska exploded with perhaps
its smallest blast to date, sending steam and ash 25,000 feet into
the air, said Geologist Steve Brantley with the Alaska Volcano
Observatory. He said the eruption is significant because it is part
of an unusually stable pattern.

   The mother of Lebanon hostage Jesse ``Jon''
Turner said Saturday she was told by the U.S. State Department that
Syrian officials had said a hostage would be released within 24 to
36 hours.
   Estelle Ronneburg said she received the call from Michael
Mahoney, her liaison with the State Department, about 5 p.m. MDT
saying that a hostage would be released.
   A State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity
told The Associated Press that Mahoney was relaying information
given to U.S. officials by the Syrian foreign minister. Mahoney
told Mrs. Ronnenburg the State Department had no information to
contradict the report, according to the official.
   Mrs. Ronnenburg said the Mahoney didn't tell her which of the
three prisoners would be released.
   ``Of course, I'm hoping it will be Jon, but if it's not, I'll be
happy for the other families,'' she said.
   A pro-Iranian group is holding Turner, along with Robert
Polhill, a business professor, and Alann Steen, a journalist,
hostage.
   Turner was one of four Beirut University College staff members
taken hostage Jan. 24, 1987.
   Turner, 42, an associate professor of mathematics and computer
science at the Beirut campus, was abducted with three other
academics, two Americans and an Indian, by men posing as police
assigned to protect the college staff.
   He moved to Beirut from Hawaii in 1983, his mother said.
   Turner's Lebanese wife, gave birth to a daughter, Joanne, on
July 24, 1987, five months after he was kidnapped.
   His first wife, Ina Clare Turner, lives in Hayden, Idaho.

   Republican gubernatorial nominee Clayton Williams
disclosed that he paid prostitutes for sex a number of times in
Mexico and his native West Texas, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   He said it has been at least 35 years since he visited a
prostitute and considered it a rite of passage.
   ``Why, of course,'' Williams, 58, told The Houston Post when
asked whether he ever paid women for sex.
   ``It's part of growing up in West Texas ... It's like the Larry
McMurtry book, `The Last Picture Show,''' the Midland rancher and
oilman said. The book is about teen-age affairs in a small Texas
town in 1951.
   Williams told the Post he first paid for sex at age 16.
   In addition to patronizing prostitutes as a teen-ager, Williams
said he paid for sex while a student at Texas A&amp;M University.
   Williams, who faces Democratic state Treasurer Ann Richards in
the November gubernatorial general election and has campaigned as a
law-and-order candidate, said the disclosure has no bearing on his
leadership capabilities as a mature adult.
   Prostitution is illegal in Texas and was illegal 35 years ago;
it is legal in parts of Mexico.
   A call by The Associated Press to the Richards campaign late
Saturday was answered by a machine.
   The Post interviewed Williams at a posh desert resort in
Scottsdale, Ariz., where he was spending the weekend for the annual
meeting of the All-American Wildcatters, a fraternity of sorts for
independent oilmen.
   The colorful millionaire, never before elected to public office,
has sunk $5.6 million of his own money in an $8 million campaign.
   Williams came under fire from women's groups and political
opponents last month when he jokingly likened bad weather to rape,
saying if it was inevitable to ``just relax and enjoy it.''
   The day after he made the remark, Williams apologized and said
he realized his comment was ``insensitive.''
   During a visit to Washington earlier last month, Williams told
reporters he would feel uncomfortable running against a woman.
   Williams and his wife, Modesta, celebrate their 25th wedding
anniversary next month. They have three children, including two
adopted teen-age boys. Williams also has two children from a
previous marriage.
   As she did when her husband faced heat for the rape remark,
Modesta Williams stood by him Saturday on the subject of
prostitution, the Post reported.
   ``What he did before we were married is certainly his business.
That doesn't bother me at all,'' she said.

   A middle-ranking Nigerian officer
speaking on his nation's radio claimed Sunday to have overthrown
the military government of President Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. A
Western diplomatic source in Paris said gunfire had been heard in
Lagos.
   Some radio stations outside Lagos, the capital of the West
African nation, appeared to be broadcasting normally, and the
major's claim could not be confirmed.
   A man identifying himself as Maj. Gigi Oguaza Oka read a
statement on National Radio in Lagos saying: ``Fellow Nigerian
citizens: On behalf of the patriotic and well-meaning peoples of
the middle belt and southern parts of this county, I ... wish to
happily inform you of the successful ousting of the dictatorial,
corrupt, drug-baronish, inhumane, sadistic, deceitful, homosexually
centered and unpatriotic administration of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.''
   Babangida's military government has been viewed as heavily
weighted in favor of the Moslem north since the forced retirement
earlier this year of Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Domkat Bali.
   A statement read on the Lagos radio, which was monitored in
Abidjan, called on students, workers, lawyers and shopkeepers to
take to the streets to support the coup. It also said military men
were confined to their bases, and an overnight curfew was being
imposed.
   During intervals in broadcasts of martial music, the radio
accused Babangida of widespread corruption and human rights
violations.
   Babangida took power in a barracks coup on Aug. 27, 1985.

   Beirut radio stations said U.S. hostage
Alann Steen is likely to be freed from 39 months of captivity
Sunday on his 51st birthday.
   The reports in morning newscasts said Steen, a Boston native,
may be released within ``a few hours.''
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, sources close to the Iranian
Embassy told The Associated Press that Steen's frail health could
persuade his kidnappers to end his ordeal. Steen is held by the
pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
   On Saturday, state-run Beirut television reported pro-Iranian
kidnappers would turn the freed U.S. hostage over to the U.S.
ambassador in Syria.
   In Boise, Idaho, the mother of hostage Jesse Turner said she
received a call Saturday from a State Department official, saying a
hostage would be released within 24 to 36 hours.
   A department official confirmed the call, but said the United
States was only relaying information given to it by Syrian
officials and had no reason to contradict that information.
   Beirut television's English-language news bulletin quoted an
unidentified Syrian official as saying the hostage would be ``freed
sometime on Sunday, probably in the morning,'' by Islamic Jihad for
the Liberation of Palestine.
   ``The hostage will be produced at the Syrian Foreign Ministry
and then handed over to U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian,'' said
the station, which is based in Moslem west Beirut. It did not
elaborate.
   Its sister station in Christian east Beirut later broadcast the
same report, which could not be independently verified.
   The reports predicting Steen's release were broadcast Sunday by
the prestigious Moslem-run Voice of the Nation and the Voice of the
People, a communist-run station in west Beirut.
   Voice of the Nation said Steen will be freed ``in line with the
ostentatious behavior of the hostage-holders.''
   Steen suffers from chronic high blood pressure. In the early
days of his captivity, the kidnappers reported he was gravely ill
and near death. But he appeared on a videotape released in May 1987
and said he had recovered.
   Earlier Saturday, an Iranian daily that usually reflects the
thinking of Iran's president urged the Lebanese kidnappers to keep
their promise to free an American hostage despite their claim that
Washington was delaying the release.
   The Tehran Times, which has repeatedly called for the release of
all Western hostages in Lebanon over the last three months, said in
an editorial that the release could be ``the prelude to the release
of one more hostage by another group.''
   Daryl Penner, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Damascus,
stressed Saturday that Washington will not send John Kelly,
Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs, to negotiate
the release as demanded by the kidnappers.
   Syrian Foreign Ministry sources, however, said the U.S. Embassy
had requested and been granted permission to land a plane at
Damascus airport.
   U.S. Embassy officials declined comment. But the sources said
the plane was believed to be to fly a released hostage to
Wiesbaden, West Germany.
   American captives released in the past have been flown to the
U.S. military hospital there for medical checks and debriefing. A
U.S. team flew there Thursday.
   Turner's mother, Estelle Ronneburg, said in Boise that she was
called by Michael Mahoney, her liaison with the State Department.
She said he did not specify which of the hostages would be
released. Turner is one of three U.S. educators held by the
pro-Iranian group and one of eight Americans held in Lebanon.
   A State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity
told The Associated Press that Mahoney was relaying information
given to U.S. officials by the Syrian foreign minister. Mahoney
told Mrs. Ronnenburg the State Department has no information to
contradict the report, according to the official.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu gave no indication the
Bush administration had any confirmation of a Sunday release.
   ``You're always hopeful, but having gone through frustrations
over the years I think everybody involved in this is going to
believe it only after it happens,'' Sununu told CBS News on
Saturday.
   The captors said Wednesday they would free an American within 48
hours, and they demanded Kelly go to Damascus to finalize
arrangements.
   But the following day the group declared the release postponed
indefinitely after President Bush, citing U.S. policy not to
negotiate with terrorists, refused to send Kelly to Syria.
   The Tehran Times, an English-language daily, said in an
editorial Saturday that U.S. Ambassador Djerejian is ``good enough
to conduct the arrangements for the release of the hostage.''
Djerejian has been involved in frequent talks with Syrian officials
since returning to Damascus Thursday.
   The Iranian newspaper, which is close to President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, expressed impatience with the postponement and said it
hoped the freeing of one captive could be ``the prelude to the
release of one more hostage by another group.''
   It did not specify which pro-Iranian faction it meant by
``another group.'' There are 18 Westerners currently held in
Lebanon.
   Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's so-called pragmatists, has been
seeking for months to free the hostages as part of his efforts to
improve Iran's relations with the West after a decade of hostility.
   He believes that securing the release of hostages will encourage
Western companies to invest in Iran to boost its limping economy
and hopefully encourage Washington to release an estimated $12
billion in frozen assets.
   The Iranian leader is opposed by fundamentalist, anti-Western
radicals in the Tehran hierarchy.
   An aide to Hussein Musawi, Shiite Moslem mentor of Islamic Jihad
for the Liberation of Palestine, said Saturday that Musawi remains
sure that the group will free one of the Americans it holds.
   But the aide, contacted by telephone by The Associated Press,
gave no indication when that might be.
   Musawi heads the Shiite Islamic Amal faction based in the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon. He said Friday he
believed the release will go ahead despite Washington's ``arrogant
... cowboy behavior.''
   In addition to Turner, a communications professor and Steen, a
journalism professor, the group holds Robert Polhill, 55, an
accounting lecturer from New York. The three were kidnapped from
the campus of the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University College on Jan.
24, 1987, by gunmen disguised as riot police.
   Also missing in Lebanon are five other Americans, four Britons,
two West Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman.
   The longest-held captive is Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985, and is held by another Iranian-backed Shiite faction,
Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.

<HEAD>Pope Calls for Meeting of European Bishops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VELEHRAD, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Sunday
called for an unprecedented meeting of European bishops to allow
the church to keep pace with the political changes sweeping the
continent.
   He made the announcement as he visited a shrine in Moravia
dedicated to Cyril and Methodius, who introduced Christianity to
the Slavs 12 centuries ago. The old Communist regime barred him
from visiting here in 1985.
   John Paul said the meeting, called a synod, will be held ``at a
not too distant date.''
   Papal spokesmen Joaquin Navarro said he did not expect it would
be held this year. He said details will be announced in Rome on
Tuesday.
   The synod would be the first such continent-wide summit bringing
together bishops from all European countries.
   ``Today in this very place, we are seeing the signs of a new
blessing in the promising travail of deep and vital
transformations,'' said the pope, speaking from an altar at a
700-year-old basilica.
   He said the European bishops should have the opportunity to
``reflect more on the historic moment for Europe and the church.''
   Navarro also announced the pope may visit Cuba in December. The
pope had earlier accepted an invitation to visit the Caribbean
island ruled by a hard-line Communist government, but no date had
been set.
   Before the Mass, the pontiff rode through the cobblestone
streets of Velehrad, in central Czechoslovakia, in his white
Popemobile. Crowds chanted ``Long live the Holy Father!''
   As John Paul prepared to say Mass outside the basilica, redone
in Baroque style in the 17th century, a huge throng gathered. The
worshipers included Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who
in August became the East bloc's first non-Communist government
leader.
   The Czechoslovak news agency CTK estimated the crowd at 200,000
to 400,000.
   Archbishop Frantisek Vanak of Olomouc welcomed John Paul to the
altar. The archbishop referred to the pope's frustrated attempt to
visit Velehrad in 1985 for a feast to celebrate 1,100 years of
Christianity in Czechoslovakia.
   Czechoslovakia's leaders, who were then Communist, refused
permission for the papal visit to this city where Cyril and
Methodius introduced Christianity to the Slavs.
   ``This visit was preceded by years of yearning to have you, the
pope, Christ's witness, here among us. This yearning was growing
all the more and more as the dark forces tried to hinder it,''
Vanak said. ``But God's cause prevailed.''
   The pope has made the celebration of Eastern Europe's toppling
of communism a major theme of his two-day trip, which began
Saturday. It is his first to the region since the dramatic changes
that rocked Communist regimes last year.
   Until the communist regime fell, such a trip was impossible.
   But John Paul is also warning Eastern European countries about
``viruses'' from the West, such as secularism, hedonism and atheism.
   After celebrating the Mass at Velehrad, the pope was to fly 90
miles to Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, for another open-air
service.
   Statistics released by the Vatican estimate 10.7 million
Catholics live in Czechoslovakia, out of a population of 15.6
million.
   The pope, who turns 70 next month, was making the 46th foreign
pilgrimage of his pontificate.

   President Bush said Sunday he has not
heard ``anything new'' about reports that an American hostage was
about to be released in Lebanon.
   The vacationing president, standing on a beach at sunrise, said,
``Since the hopes of the American people have once again been
raised, I can't tell you that I've learned anything new this
morning at all.''
   Later, on his way to go fishing in the Florida Keys, Bush told
reporters his staff was in contact with the U.S. embassy in
Damascus every three minutes to keep up with the situation.
   ``There's no news to it, no news .... I just talked to the
situation room,'' Bush told reporters shouting questions to him
shortly after 8 a.m. EDT.
   Asked if a hostage would be released today, Bush said, ``We
don't know. We're talking every three minutes to our embassy in
Damascus ..., but there is no news there now.''
   Bush, who rose early on Earth Day to honor an environmental
group protecting Florida's coral reefs, said earlier that he didn't
want to ``be a part of raising the hopes of the families and then
not have something happen.''
   Bush added, ``I wish I could tell you, but there isn't any news
that's been brought to my attention this morning. But let's hope,
because this was one of the days that's been signaled as where
there might be some action.''
   Asked how he would respond to a release of one of the eight
American hostages in Lebanon, Bush said, ``Too hypothetical.''
   ``You've got to see what happens. I'm talking about release of
all the hostages.'' That is ``the bottom line,'' he said.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine said last
Wednesday it would release a U.S. hostage within 48 hours, then
postponed any release.
   There were widespread reports in Beirut that Alann Steen, a
college teacher held for more than three years, might be released
on Sunday, his 51st birthday.
   Bush said, ``We want every American held against his will, her
will, released, wherever they may be. That's the ground rules.
That's the bottom line.''
   ``Let's hope there's some action,'' he added, ``but there's no
point in my speculating.''
   ``Put yourself in the place of these families. One day, there's
a picture of one of these hostages, the very next day it's
another,'' he said.
   ``I don't consider that a very good way to deal with the
emotions and the prayers of the families, frankly, so I can't
contribute any more to it.''
   Bush spoke briefly with reporters on a beach in the Florida Keys
after presenting one of his ``Point of Light'' awards to Reef
Relief of Key West, Fla.
   He also used the occasion to announce a proposal to close the
coral reefs off the Florida Keys to ships longer than 50 meters and
all vessels carrying oil or hazardous materials.
   He said the United States is petitioning the International
Maritime Organization to establish an ``area to be avoided'' 10
miles off the Florida coast from Key Biscayne to the Dry Tortugas.
If granted, the area would be marked on international navigation
charts.

   The military government said it crushed a
coup attempt Sunday after heavy fighting with renegade troops who
wanted to break up Nigeria's federation of states to end Moslem
domination.
   The rebellious soldiers battled troops loyal to President Gen.
Ibrahim Babangida for control of the capital Sunday after radio
reports said that a coup was under way in this sprawling West
African nation.
   But 11 hours after the fighting began, Lt. Gen. Sani Abacha,
army chief and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, went on the
radio to say the coup was smashed. He also said Babangida was safe.
   Abacha's declaration that rebels not already in custody should
give themselves up suggested that pockets of resistance remained.
   The rebellion appeared to be led by middle-ranking officers
opposed to traditional domination by Moslem northerners over the
central and southern states, which are mainly Christian and animist.
   Early Sunday, a man identifying himself as Maj. Gideon Ngwozor
Oka announced on the Lagos station of Radio Nigeria:
   ``Fellow Nigerian citizens, on behalf of the patriotic and
well-meaning peoples of the Middle Belt and southern parts of this
country, I ... wish to happily inform you of the successful ousting
of the dictatorial, corrupt, drug-baronish, inhumane, sadistic,
deceitful, homosexually centered and unpatriotic administration of
Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.''
   Oka's announcement accused the northern states of Borno, Bauchi,
Kano, Katsina and Sokoto of ``messing up'' the rest of the country
through their domination. He said those states would not be allowed
to be part of Nigeria until they fulfilled conditions proving
loyalty to a new government.
   Some Radio Nigeria stations in other cities continued
broadcasting normally.
   Moslems are in a slight majority in Nigeria, Africa's most
populous nation, with 100 million people.
   A similar conflict caused the 1967-1969 Biafran War. More than
500,000 civilians and 100,000 soldiers died when easterners
attempted to form the state of Biafra and secede from Nigeria's
federation.
   Babangida took power in a barracks coup on Aug. 27, 1985.
Nigeria, an oil-rich nation, became independent from Britain in
1960.

   Pro-Iranian, Shiite Moslem extremists
said Sunday they will free one of three American educators they
hold within 24 hours.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine made the
announcement in a hand-written statement delivered to Beirut's
independent An-Nahar daily and a Western news agency.
   The statement did not say which of the Americans the group has
held since Jan. 24, 1987, will be freed. But it was authenticated
by an instant photograph of one of the three hostages, Robert
Polhill.

   Here is the text of a statement issued
Sunday by Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, as
translated from Arabic by The Associated Press.
   After the complete collapse of the scheduled release operation,
there were energetic mediations to reach acceptable solutions.
   So it was decided to begin final arrangements in response to
efforts by an esteemed Islamic spiritual leadership, officials in
the Islamic republic and officials in Syria, and within 24 hours
the American will be freed.
   We ask Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan to be in beirut during this
period. Thus we have shown our good intentions in moving this issue
toward a balanced solution. The other side should come forth and
prove good intentions, too.
   Lastly, we warn that continued Israeli aggressions will
definitely lead to grave consequences in this case and other cases.
We hope that we will not be forced to escalate anew so everything
that has been reached will be undermined.
   Peace upon those who serve justice for the sake of justice.
   The Organization of Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine.

   Evelyn Dietrich wrapped a hot
sausage at her snack bar in Heiligenstadt's tiny market square,
then glanced to see how many customers a visiting West German
competitor was getting.
   ``Sometimes it's hard to believe there's a border anymore,'' she
said.
   Politicians still debate when and how Germany's division will
end officially, but practical unification is happening rapidly
along the hilly frontier.
   Heiligenstadt, population 16,000, and other East German border
towns are at the heart of the change.
   West German department stores advertise regularly in the town
newspapers, offering everything from pantyhose to chain saws.
Social gatherings of East and West Germans are as common as walking
across the street for a neighborly visit.
   West German businessmen anticipating future profits stock the
stores with electronic goods and clothing. West German beer is a
favorite in the taverns.
   In Heiligenstadt, Ms. Dietrich's stand is next to a huge sausage
van run by an entrepreneur from nearby Eschwege, West Germany.
   ``Our prices are far better than his, so we don't have any
trouble keeping our customers,'' she said. ``In fact, some of our
best customers are from the West.''
   Over Easter, thousands of Mercedes, BMWs, Volkswagens and other
West German cars plied the narrow road that winds through the hills
to Heiligenstadt, a spa that retains some of its old charm despite
decades of communist neglect and coal-befouled air.
   East German border officials waved them through, often without
even a cursory check.
   West Germany's currency is not expected to replace the East
German mark until summer, as part of an economic union in which
West Germans probably will run most of the business, but an
unofficial merger is under way.
   West German business people have swarmed across the border,
checking out market prospects and buildings where they can open
stores, preparing for the day when doing business in East Germany
will be much the same as at home.
   State-owned East German stores are selling West German goods.
Eastern bank accounts are being filled with the East mark profits
of West German businessmen who hope for a bonanza when the
Deutschemark bcomes East Germany's legal tender.
   Uwe Fritsch, 30, runs a shop in nearby Muehlhausen that once
sold second-hand goods but now stocks electronics goods from West
Germany.
   ``Last week a truck came in loaded with cassette recorders and
other products,'' he said. ``Everything was sold out within three
days. We had to hand over some of the goods to other shops in
Muehlhausen because we didn't have the personnel to deal with it.''
   Fritsch said the prices of West German televisions and stereos
were lower than those of comparable domestic goods cost, which were
rarely available.
   Coming together also causes problems.
   West Germans are buying up vast quantities of East German goods
at relatively low state-subsidized prices, creating hostility among
their poorer cousins.
   Property ownership is another sore point.
   Mayor Bernd Beck cited ``many instances'' of West Germans who
once lived in Heiligenstadt trying to claim property they left
behind.
   ``There are some who once owned businesses here and want them
back,'' he said.
   Beck said nothing can be done until the two Germanys agree on
how to settle the claims, and added: ``We can't throw anybody out
on the street. That wouldn't be fair.''
   East Germans fear thousands of jobs will be lost as the planned
economy is replaced by free-market operations.
   ``People are very uneasy about what the price of economic union
with the West will be,'' said Roswitha Vogler, who works at a meat
market in Muellhausen.
   Economists have said up to 2 million East German jobs could be
lost because many factories and businesses will lose out to
competitors from the wealthy West.
   West German products have been something of a mixed blessing for
East Germans.
   Even though electronic goods are generally cheaper and more
plentiful, some other Western products cost up to three times what
East Germans are used to paying.
   Employees of a women's store said they still sell only East
German clothing because few people in Heiligenstadt could afford
items made in the West.
   When customers have a choice of most goods, however, the
domestic product usually loses out.
   ``From juice to lemonade to yogurt, there's so much from over
there,'' Fritsch said. ``Our people crave goods from the Golden
West, but leave products made here sitting on the shelves.''

   Judy Kersetter remembers when her mother
used to wander in the house, stopping only to pick up newspapers or
magazines that she couldn't even read.
   But that was before Martha Young, 77, began attending an
Alzheimer's day-care center last year. The center is run by
Intergenerational Services Inc., which may stop operating at the
end of the month because of a dispute with an insurance company
over whether its services can be considered psychotherapy.
   ``She's more alert, much more responsive. She seems more aware
of what's going on around her. And her communication skills have
improved tremendously,'' said Mrs. Kersetter, who has been taking
care of her mother for the last five years.
   Nationwide Insurance, the carrier for Medicare in Ohio, began
rejecting claims for the agency's services Oct. 1. The
Columbus-based insurance company contends Intergenerational's
programs are recreational and social, and do not qualify as
psychotherapy under Medicare guidelines.
   Nationwide and Intergenerational agree that Medicare's
guidelines on what constitutes psychotherapy treatment for
Alzheimer's are vague.
   ``Medicare carriers are paid to apply judgment to the claims
that are being filed, and we have to use very basic and vague
guidelines,'' said Jeannine Keating, Nationwide's manager of
administrative support services. ``I think if you ask most people
what they consider to be psychotherapy, it's not sitting five
people in a circle playing bean bag.''
   Intergenerational says Nationwide is trying to drive the agency
out of business because of the amount of its claims.
   Caught in the middle are 2,000 families who depend on
Intergenerational programs to help family members with Alzheimer's,
a degenerative brain disorder that slowly robs its victims of
memory and intellectual functioning. The agency also helps people
with other forms of dementia, or severely diminished mental
capacity.
   ``I'm very worried,'' said Mrs. Kersetter, whose mother has been
going to the center four days a week. ``If the services stop,
she'll regress rapidly. She'll lose the ability to respond. She'll
become very passive, vegetative.''
   Intergenerational, a non-profit agency founded five years ago in
Toledo, offers what the agency considers to be psychotherapy
services to victims of Alzheimer's and related dementia in 66
nursing homes in 15 northwest Ohio counties.
   The agency said it would close by the end of the month unless
Nationwide changes its policy.
   Since October, more than 40,000 claims totaling about $1.1
million have not been paid to Intergenerational. The agency depends
on Medicare for 80 percent of its $2.5 million annual budget.
   Nationwide withheld payments pending a hearing last month by a
company examiner. The examiner ruled that the payments were not
medically necessary. Intergenerational has appealed the decision.
   Susan Lemle, Intergenerational's program director, said the
services may appear to be simple, but they help patients become
more sociable and ease depression.
   ``We do some singing, do different things to get people to
interact with each other,'' Ms. Lemle said. ``For instance, we
might have them introduce themselves to each other, shake hands,
maybe play games with another person. We might do some kind of word
game, or pick a specific topic of the day. All this gives them an
opportunity to talk about things they've done in the past. It
raises their self-esteem.''
   Medicare does not have specific guidelines involving
psychotherapy for Alzheimer's patients, said Steven Arney, chief of
carrier operations for the federal Health Care Finance
Administration, which runs Medicare.
   But he said Intergenerational's problem is that most of the
agency's programs, while they are under the general supervision of
doctors, are not conducted by licensed psychotherapists and
therefore cannot be fully reimbursed. If the insurance company
running the Medicare program in Ohio chooses not to reimburse at
all, Arney said, such a decision would be within the federal
guidelines.
   Arney said he knew of no other program in the country serving
Alzheimer's patients where a similar dispute over whether to define
it as psychotherapy has arisen.
   Intergenerational, which began at the suggestion of a Toledo
nursing home, has trained seven agencies in Ohio to begin similar
programs. Ms. Keating said Nationwide will examine the other
programs after the Intergenerational case.
   ``We'll be looking at more than Intergenerational. We'll take
appropriate action once the investigation is concluded,'' Ms.
Keating said.
   Meantime, a group known as Advocates for Alzheimer's Victims is
circulating petitions asking that Nationwide resume Medicare
funding to the agency. It intends to present them to state
legislators to pressure Nationwide to reverse its policy. Eleven
area chapters of the American Association of Retired Persons are
helping.
   ``We're fighting for our lives,'' Reber said. ``And if we lose,
it's the people with Alzheimer's who are going to suffer.''

   Authorities early today evacuated about
300 people in and around this northeast Texas town after an old oil
well began leaking a harmful gas.
   The leak of hydrogen sulfide was discovered about 5:30 a.m. and
was shut down a short time later. But the evacuation was ordered
because some gas lingered in the area.
   Some people complained of nausea and difficulty breathing, but
felt better when they left the area. In large doses, the gas can be
fatal, authorities said.
   About 300 people had been moved from their homes by 10 a.m. Many
of those have been sent to a school in the community of
Liberty-Elyau.
   Dave Hall, emergency management coordinator at nearby Texarkana,
said people may be able to return home by noon after winds
dissipate the gas.
   There have been no injuries, but an ambulance was standing by,
officials said.
   Staff at the Red River Army Depot, a short distance from
Redwater, have not been told to evacuate, said Jay Higgs of the
Bowie County office of emergency services.
   Redwater is in the northeast corner of Texas not far from the
Arkansas border.

<TEXT>
   Ambassador Edward L. Rowny urged the Soviet
Union on Sunday to follow up on its admission of guilt in the 1940
massacre of thousands of Polish officers in the Katyn Forest and
``tell the whole truth'' about all such acts in its history.
   Rowny, who is President Bush's special adviser on arms control,
said that while Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has made real
progress in ``filling in the blank spots'' in Soviet history, ``the
conscience of the world demands that it do more.''
   ``Genocidal totalitarianism didn't start with Stalin,'' Rowny
said in remarks prepared for delivery at a ceremony in Jersey City,
N.J., sponsored by Polish-American organizations at the Katyn
Forest Memorial. A text of his remarks was released in Washington.
   ``We must be very clear on this point because communism's
apologists would like us to believe that all the blood on Moscow's
hands is the fault of the `Stalinist personality cult' and not of
communism itself,'' Rowny said.
   ``For the Soviet authorities to admit to the full scope of
communism's crimes will be painful, but it will also be a purifying
step,'' he said. ``That is why we continue to challenge the Soviet
regime to renounce totalitarianism and all of its works.''

<HEAD>Ceausescus Beg For Mercy, Weep in New Execution Footage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu wept silently
and his wife Elena begged for mercy as soldiers readied them for
the firing squad, according to footage of their execution broadcast
Sunday.
   Extracts of the graphic 90-minute videotape were aired
exclusively by the French television network TF1. They are the most
detailed look yet at the execution Dec. 25 at a military base
outside Bucharest. The Ceausescus were executed days after being
toppled by a popular revolution.
   ``Don't attack us! We have the right to die the way we want,''
Elena Ceausescu told soldiers and the 10-person civilian-military
tribunal that sentenced the couple to death.
   ``Children ...'' Mrs. Ceausescu sniffed at the soldiers who tied
her hands behind her back. ``You are bruising my hands. This is
shameful. Why, why? I raised you all like a mother.''
   Nicolae Ceausescu, who ruled Romania with an iron fist for a
quarter-century, struggled briefly with the soldiers but said
nothing. Tears rolled down his cheeks.
   Soldiers placed the couple, who were not blindfolded, against a
brick wall and others rapidly opened fire, emptying their
magazines. The Ceausescus crumpled under the bullets, which also
peppered the brick wall.
   A medic then looked for signs of life in the eyes of Elena
Ceausescu as blood poured from her head. He found none.
   Subsequent images showed Nicolae Ceausescu embalmed and prepared
for burial. His face appeared broken and gray.
   Gelu Voican, the gray-bearded civilian who organized the
proceedings, later was filmed before the two graves where he said
the Ceausescus were buried in an Orthodox ceremony.
   Voican serves as vice prime minister in the interim government
headed by Prime Minister Ion Iliescu. Elections to form a new
government are scheduled for late May.
   Previous excerpts made public from the same tape have shown only
the Ceausescus at the trial and their lifeless, cleaned bodies
laying before the brick wall.
   The cameraman recording the execution was accidentally wounded,
said TF1 journalist Patrick Bourrat.

   About half of city dwellers in the Third World
are squatters, living in homemade shacks or mud huts on borrowed
land with no electricity or plumbing.
   Even in industrialized nations such as the Soviet Union,
extended families live cheek by jowl in aging high-rises, and in
the United States a growing number of people can barely afford
housing or are homeless despite record levels of home-building
during the last 40 years.
   ``It's safe to say there's hardly a country in the world that
has found a solution to adequate housing,'' said Norman Flynn,
president of the National Association of Realtors, which is
sponsoring a Washington conference on the world housing dilemma
this week.
   Following an opening speech by Housing Secretary Jack Kemp on
Tuesday, representatives from 350 public and private organizations
from more than 65 countries will examine case studies from 13
nations describing their housing experiences and ideas for
improvements.
   The meeting will focus on increasing the private sector's
involvement in low-income housing.
   One of the major problems in developing countries is the mass
migration of rural residents to cities in search of better lives,
said Michael Cohen, director of the World Bank's Urban Division.
   In 1950, there were 273 million people living in urban areas of
less developed countries, Cohen said. By 1975, that number had
swelled to 819 million, and the projection for the year 2000 is 2.1
billion.
   ``Mega-cities'' such as Mexico City now hold 25 million people,
and Sao Paolo, Brazil, has attracted 20 million, said Cohen. A vast
number of these migrants have been forced to take up residence as
squatters at city fringes, living in unsafe, homemade structures
illegally built on someone else's land, he said.
   ``In Latin America it's frequently shacks. In Africa, it's
frequently mud huts,'' said Cohen. ``In the 1980s, probably half
the population in most major Third World cities lived in squatter
areas or slums,'' which usually lack electricity, toilet facilities
and water.
   The World Bank, which draws its funds from national government
and world capital markets, lent 60 developing countries $10.1
billion for housing and urban development projects between 1972 and
June 1990, Cohen said.
   But the bank increasingly is funneling money through governments
to private enterprise, he said.
   In the Soviet Union, where people pay nominal rent to live in
cramped quarters in ``monotonous'' government-owned apartment
buildings, attempts are being made to improve quality of life and
create more individual investment, says Alexander Krivov, who
coordinated a Soviet case study.
   New programs aim to nearly double home building by encouraging
more private construction and ownership, concentrating efforts on
single-family homes in the suburbs, said Krivov, who is vice
chairman of the State Committee on Architecture and Urban Planning
in Moscow.
   ``Single-family houses with pieces of land around it _ it's
another pattern of life, another quality of life,'' he said.
   In the United States, where nearly all housing is built by
private developers, the gap between the ``haves and the have-nots''
is increasing, said John Tuccillo, coordinator of the U.S. case
study and senior vice president and chief economist for the
Realtors association.
   Tuccillo said building regulations designed to protect the
public's welfare have become a burden instead, increasing
developers' costs, limiting flexibility and wasting time.
   ``It's a case for easing those standards a bit to allow the
production of housing that's within the reach of folks who have a
hard time acquiring housing,'' he said.
   Other countries presenting case studies at the conference
include Zimbabwe, India, Indonesia, Thailand, China, Trinidad and
Tobago, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, Portugal and West Germany.
   The meeting is the third public-private convention held to
discuss housing needs worldwide. China, the Soviet Union and
Eastern bloc countries will participate for the first time.

<HEAD>Rural AIDS Epidemic Spawning Same Fears as Early Stages of Urban
Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was like a journey back in time when the
National AIDS Commission traveled to south Georgia last week for a
firsthand look at how rural areas are coping with the deadly
disease.
   ``I'm afraid we're seeing history repeat itself,'' said Dr. June
Osborn, chairwoman of the panel, after the commission spent two
days in Waycross, Albany and Macon visiting with AIDS patients and
talking with health care professionals.
   ``The same fear, the same isolation for people with AIDS, the
same difficulty in mobilizing coordinated care that we saw in the
beginning of the urban epidemic back a few years ago is happening
all over again,'' she said.
   The commission's trip came on the heels of a federal Centers for
Disease Control report that AIDS is spreading more rapidly in rural
areas than in cities. From 1988 to 1989, the CDC found that
nonmetropolitan areas had a 37 percent increase in new AIDS cases
while metro areas had only a 5 percent gain.
   In Georgia, the state Department of Human Resources reported in
January that the number of AIDS cases had tripled in two years,
with the rapid spread of the disease in rural parts of the state
linked to drug users and heterosexual transmission.
   Rep. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., a member of the commission, agreed with
Osborn's assessment that history may be repeating itself. But
Rowland, a physician who practiced in rural Dublin, Ga., for 28
years before being elected to Congress, said he does not think
rural areas will have as much difficulty overcoming those problems
of fear and discrimination as urban areas have had.
   ``There's a lot more acceptance of the fact that this is a
disease that we need to be fighting and not fighting the people who
have the disease,'' Rowland said. ``I don't think the battle is
going to be as tough in rural areas because of that.''
   Still, Osborn said she was shocked at the extent to which health
care professionals in rural Georgia were avoiding AIDS cases.
   ``Some of the public fear is bouncing off the fear of health
professionals,'' she said. ``It was striking to us that while there
were some very committed people doing wonderful work, there was
also an undercurrent of health professionals not really wanting to
touch these people.''
   In south Georgia as in most rural areas, commission members said
they found a health care system even less prepared to deal with an
onslaught of AIDS cases than the already overburdened health care
systems in cities like New York and San Francisco.
   ``The rural health care system is much more fragile than the
urban, just on a matter of scale and the fact that many of these
rural areas already have severe doctor shortages,'' Osborn said.
   Since even a small number of AIDS cases could overburden a
struggling rural hospital, Osborn said it is critical that people
infected with the HIV virus in rural areas be treated in the early
stages of the disease and continuously thereafter.
   ``In the big cities where AIDS is already hitting as hard as it
is, it's going to be very hard to play catchup because you've
already got hospitals teetering,'' she said.
   ``But in rural areas, if one were paying good attention and
shoring up some of the existing primary health care and public
health capabilities, it's possible you could get out in front
before the number of cases gets overwhelming,'' she said.
   Both Osborn and Rowland said they expect the commission to take
an active role in urging Congress to provide new funding to attack
the AIDS problem in rural areas.
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee earlier this
month unanimously approved a bill that would provide $600 million
in emergency funds to help alleviate the AIDS care crisis.
   Half of the $600 million would be directed to cities with more
than 2,000 AIDS cases, but the other half would go to states to
permit them to develop comprehensive HIV care programs in small
cities and rural areas.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.
   The disease is spread most often through sexual contact, needles
or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood
products, and from infected pregnant women to their offspring.

<HEAD>In Campaign Fund Raising, Advantage: Incumbent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A month after announcing her Senate candidacy,
New Jersey Republican Christine Todd Whitman had raised $70,000, or
roughly $2,300 a day. Not bad for a little-known challenger.
   But Whitman's opponent, Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley, has been
raising $5,000 a day for more than five years. That's more than $9
million.
   Whitman's situation, although extreme, is far from unique. The
lifeblood of politics is money, and for challengers cash often is
hard to come by.
   The problem is greatest for challengers like Whitman who never
have held major elected office. But the pinch also is being felt by
four GOP House members challenging Democratic senators this year;
all four trail in the fund-raising race, according to the latest
campaign finance reports.
   Critics of the campaign finance system see the fund-raising
imbalance as the main reason so few incumbents are defeated; 98.3
percent of House incumbents were re-elected in 1988.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of the citizens lobby Common Cause,
said the current campaign finance situation is ``a system where
incumbents are drowning in special interest money while challengers
are starving for resources. It also leads to a challenger-proof
Congress.''
   Cash-poor challengers with personal wealth frequently resort to
lending themselves money, and often end their campaigns with
considerable debts. FEC data show Senate challengers relied on
personal loans for 10 percent of their campaign money in 1988
elections; House challengers for 19 percent.
   In Massachusetts, Democratic Sen. John Kerry raised nearly
$760,000 in the first three months of 1990, more than double the
$470,000 raised by two Republicans vying for the chance to
challenge him in November. The GOP totals include a combined
$320,000 the challengers lent their campaigns during the first
quarter, according to Federal Election Commission reports.
   House races typically cost less than Senate campaigns, so the
fund-raising gap between incumbents and challengers generally is
smaller. But there are gaps nonetheless.
   In Pennsylvania, Democratic Rep. Peter Kostmayer collected
$82,000 in donations during the first three months of 1990,
according to his quarterly FEC report. His Republican opponent,
political newcomer Audrey Zettick Schaller, raised $13,500.
   Kostmayer, who spent $1 million to win re-election two years ago
and has endorsed legislation to limit campaign spending, has
refused her request that he agree to a $400,000 spending limit.
   ``No matter what limits we could come to, he has the advantages
of incumbency,'' Schaller said. ``I don't see what his problem is
except that he's not good for his word.''
   A big factor in the lopsided fund-raising situation is political
action committees associated with special interest groups, which
offer a seemingly endless source of contributions for incumbents.
   FEC data show that at this point in 1988 Senate elections,
political action committees had contributed nearly $15 million to
incumbents and $2.3 million to challengers. In House races, PAC
contributions favored incumbents over challengers $32 million to
$1.2 million.
   The four House members giving up seemingly safe seats to take on
incumbent senators are getting a taste of the financial challenge
to challenging this year.
   In Illinois, Republican Rep. Lynn Martin raised $482,000 in the
first quarter of the year, compared with $556,000 for Democratic
Sen. Paul Simon. But Simon's well-stocked warchest left him with
$1.5 million on hand compared with $410,000 for Martin as of March
31, according to their FEC filings.
   Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, raised $586,000 from January through
March and had the best first quarter of the four House members. But
his fund-raising still was eclipsed by the $700,000 raised by Sen.
Tom Harkin, who ended the quarter with $1.1 million cash on hand
compared with Tauke's $293,000.
   These challengers, however, are in line for considerable party
support as the GOP seeks to chip away at the Democratic Senate
majority.
   In the three races for open Senate seats, it is the incumbent
House members who have the clear fund-raising edge.
   In Colorado, Republican Rep. Hank Brown raised $377,000 for his
Senate campaign and had $1.1 million on hand at the end of the
first quarter. His likely Democratic challenger, Boulder County
Commissioner Jodie Heath, raised $126,000 and ended the quarter
with $71,000 in the bank.
   The importance _ and difficulty _ of fund raising is not lost on
Heath, who offered this simple assessment during a trip to
Washington seeking political action committee support:
   ``You're just sort of shamelessly begging. That's what federal
politics is about.''

   Jim Florio steamrolled opponent James
Courter in the race for governor last year with a campaign that was
praised as effective but criticized as nasty.
   As he nears his 100th day as New Jersey's 49th governor on
Wednesday, the Florio story line hasn't changed.
   Supporters praise the Democrat for taking hold of state
government with the bold hands-on style of a true leader.
   Opponents rip Florio for grasping state government with too
tight a grip, saying his administration is akin to a monarchy that
does not tolerate debate.
   Clearly, the combative former congressman from Camden did not
opt to ease into the job in his first 100 days.
   With a swiftness that matched the pace of his campaign, Florio,
52, has placed his imprint on virtually every state government
operation.
   ``Jim Florio has demonstrated something that's not all that
common in American politics: courage,'' said Ross Baker, political
scientist at Rutgers University. ``But frankly, that usually comes
from people who are not all that likeable. He's pushing an already
powerful office to its limits in a way (predecessors) Tom Kean and
Brendan Byrne never did.''
   Since January, Florio has pushed through controversial auto
insurance reform, postponed a toll increase on the New Jersey
Turnpike and proposed $1.4 billion in new taxes, including a sales
tax increase from 6 percent to 7 percent, and spending cuts to
solve a budget crisis.
   Florio enraged gun activists by proposing to ban assault
weapons, blasted the oil industry for spills in state waterways and
traded harsh words with industry officials over his auto insurance
reform.
   Florio has not been shy about blaming former Gov. Thomas H. Kean
for New Jersey's budget woes, claiming he was forced to break a
campaign promise against raising major taxes because he never knew
things were this bad.
   If he wants a program, Florio battles for it, taking no
prisoners in the sometimes dizzying process.
   ``Everyone seems to think (we've) discovered some new approach
for government by facing up to problems and not doing things that
are in the short term politically beneficial,'' Florio said in an
interview with The Associated Press. ``It may be new for people in
Trenton, but it's been my style for a long time.''
   When Allstate Insurance Co. officials blasted the plan prior to
its first legislative hearing, Florio, a former boxer, came out
smoking.
   ``They say they're the good hands people,'' Florio said at the
time. ``The question is, what part of our anatomy do they have
their hands around.''
   The auto insurance reform moved through the
Democratic-controlled legislative process within 45 days, a
lightning quick pace by Trenton standards. The 80-page measure
faces a court challenge because it forces insurers to pay off half
of the $3.1 billion debt facing the state pool for high-risk
drivers, which at one point covered more than half of the state's
motorists. Auto insurance rates in New Jersey are among the highest
in the nation.
   His budget proposes to increase the sales tax, raise taxes on
liquor, cigarettes and oil products, and eliminate a popular
homeowner rebate program. The budget includes deep cuts to many
programs.
   GOP leaders oppose the tax increases and claim Florio's strategy
is to stockpile state income sources so he can spend more on
programs in his re-election year.
   Florio makes no apologies for the swift movement of his
initiatives.
   ``This reflects the values of the people of the state,'' he
said. ``They want problems solved, not later, but sooner. They want
things managed in sensible ways.''
   ``I'm doing what has to be done to ensure we'll have financial
stability in the state and to allow the state's economy to grow,''
he said. ``To not do it will precipitate a financial crisis.''
   Baker said Florio will have to be careful about approaching
every issue in an aggressive manner. He said lawmakers are slighted
by such as manner.
   ``He needs to stroke people,'' Baker said. ``Legislators are
very bad at pursuing their own agenda but they can be very good at
wrecking someone else's.''
   The governor said he recognizes the risks.
   ``It's called accountability,'' Florio said. ``I will take the
responsibility for things that I initiate and support. If I'm going
to be held accountable, that's fine, but give me the authority to
deal with it.''

<HEAD>Medfly Adviser Warns Infestation Poses `Major Crisis'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Night after night of aerial pesticide
spraying hasn't halted the 50-mile spread of the destructive Medfly
from suburban back yards to orange and grapefruit groves in some of
the region's richest farmland.
   New outbreaks this month and the approach of summer weather have
some scientists and growers in the nation's No. 1 agricultural
state fearing the worst _ costly farm quarantines, or even more
serious, foreign embargoes of California produce.
   Compounding the worries are continual protests against nightly
helicopter missions that rain on neighborhoods a malathion-laced
syrup that is a primary weapon in the Medfly war. New doubts also
have arisen about government insistence that the eradication
campaign is working.
   The newest focus of concern is 10 fresh outbreaks of the Medfly
plague this month, all but two of them outside previously treated
infestations.
   ``This is nothing short of a major crisis,'' said entomologist
James R. Carey, a member of the state's fruit fly scientific
advisory panel.
   Carey and Richard Rice, a colleague at the University of
California, Davis, believe the Medfly has become established
throughout California, and that state policy requires an immediate
overhaul.
   ``I can think of no other explanation of what's happening,''
said Carey. He believes the sporadic late-winter Medfly discoveries
portend an explosion in Medfly populations by midsummer, when warm
weather increases the insect's breeding rates.
   ``If your house is on fire, and the fire starts in the kitchen,
you don't wait until it gets to the bedroom before you call the
fire department,'' Rice said. ``We're in deep trouble right now.''
   The Mediterranean fruit fly is considered one of the most
serious agricultural pests in the world.
   The insect, smaller than a house fly, lays its eggs in more than
250 varieties of fruits, vegetables and nuts. Within several days,
the larvae hatch and feed on the fruit, turning it into an
inedible, unsaleable mush. The 1981-82 outbreak in the state and
resulting quarantines cost growers $100 million, while another $100
million was spent on eradication.
   In a March 26 memo circulated among top agriculture officials,
Carey argues that a new, long-range and aggressive strategy must be
adopted to get rid of the Medfly this time around.
   ``I feel that a program designed to eradicate the Medfly must be
viewed as similar to those designed to eradicate major diseases
such as smallpox or malaria,'' Carey wrote.
   Carey recommends a new research effort to develop better tools
to detect and exterminate the Medfly.
   Nevertheless, officials at the California Department of Food and
Agriculture maintain that the $36.5 million Medfly eradication
program is working.
   ``Dr. Carey has not produced any scientific data to prove his
hypothesis,'' said Isi Siddiqui, an assistant director of the
department. And as a state official who supervises the war against
the Medfly, Siddiqui said he must have proof before ordering a new
strategy.
   ``Obviously we are experiencing more difficulties than we
expected,'' Siddiqui acknowledged. But he said the treatment
program, which mostly uses aerial pesticide spraying and the
release of millions of sterile Medflies, will eventually wipe out
the crop-destroying pest.
   Gov. George Deukmejian added his support Thursday, saying, ``The
Department of Agriculture is pursuing what is a time-tested method
of eradicating the Medfly.''
   Other scientists on the state's five-member advisory panel also
have failed to be persuaded by Carey and Rice, said chairman Roy
Cunningham.
   ``These finds are of course discouraging, but they aren't really
supportive of Carey's thesis,'' Cunningham said.
   Still, Cunningham acknowledged that he doesn't entirely
understand what's happening.
   Everyone agrees that a fundamental problem in determining the
extent of the infestation is the uncertainty of methods used to
detect fruit flies.
   A variety of Medfly traps, some baited with sex lures and others
with food, are set out throughout Southern California.
   But some studies suggest most Medflies ignore the traps. And for
each Medfly caught in a trap, scientists estimate, 500 to 1,000
other Medflies are still loose in the vicinity.
   ``If you ask my wish list, I think I'd like to see a more
effective lure that attracts the flies,'' Siddiqui said.
   The scientific debate, however, has left farmers wondering whom
to believe, and fearing what more outbreaks may lead to.
   ``Sure you dread it,'' said Mike Stuart, a spokesman for the
Irvine-based Western Growers Association. ``If your orchard or your
packing house or your farm is unlucky enough to be inside a
quarantine area on the basis of a fly find ... it's a nightmare.''
   The new Medfly discoveries prompted agriculture officials to
order aerial spraying in several new areas, including 19 square
miles in the Riverside County community of Woodcrest, about 55
miles east of Los Angeles.
   Agriculture officials also plan to establish a quarantine for 84
square miles around the pesticide treatment zone, including some
3,000 of Riverside County's 37,000 acres of citrus groves.

<TEXT>
   Democratic Gov. Wallace Wilkinson is
playing favorites in his party's U.S. Senate primary this year,
training his fire on a onetime ally he claims reneged on a promise.
   Wilkinson is siding with underdog John Brock, the elected state
school superintendent, over Harvey Sloane, whose own campaign for
governor in 1983 Wilkinson had championed.
   Meanwhile, the Republican incumbent, Sen. Mitch McConnell, sits
comfortably atop a $3 million campaign fund awaiting a Democratic
opponent.
   Sloane, a physician, former Louisville mayor and Jefferson
County judge-executive, says he will win the primary despite the
governor's opposition. Wilkinson, who was finance chairman in
Sloane's 1983 campaign, claims Sloane reneged on a promise to
support him in 1987.
   Sloane maintains that Wilkinson has put together a network of
party contacts to work against him. Polls, however, show little
public support being transferred to Brock.
   ``I just have not seen a dynamic in his campaign,'' Sloane said
of Brock. ``I would imagine he's looking toward the latter part of
it when the governor can get out for him.''
   McConnell, who is seeking a second term and faces only token
opposition in the May 29 primary, reserves his attacks for Sloane.
   ``I don't see much life out of the Brock campaign, and I am
assuming Sloane is going to be the opponent,'' he said.
   But Brock, who entered the race in October banking on
Wilkinson's endorsement, is equally confident of victory in the
primary.
   ``I'm always ... running scared and working hard, but I think
we're going to win in May without any difficulty,'' Brock said.
   He takes heart from Sloane's record as a two-time loser in
statewide races _ the 1979 and 1983 gubernatorial primaries.
   ``He got 30 percent of the vote in each of those elections,
which means 70 percent of the people voted for another candidate,''
Brock said.
   Sloane has spent two years preparing to run against McConnell.
As of March 31, he had $670,000 in his campaign fund, compared to
Brock's $47,000.
   Although he has the support of the state's teacher organization,
trial lawyers and organized labor, Sloane has failed to unite the
Democratic hierarchy behind him.
   Former Gov. Edward ``Ned'' Breathitt endorsed Brock, as did Dr.
Grady Stumbo, who ran for governor in 1983 and 1987 and enjoyed
wide support in the rural areas of eastern and western Kentucky.
   Sloane's recent problems include the prospect of employee
layoffs and the closing of health clinics in Jefferson County
because of a budget crisis left from his term. He also has been
hurt by the disclosure that the state Board of Medical Licensure
had privately criticized him for prescribing his own sleeping
pills, even though he maintains no active medical practice.
   That Brock has not tried to exploit those issues puzzles some
observers, including McConnell.
   ``Frankly, if Brock were better at running for office, he could
win the primary based upon what's out there already,'' McConnell
said.
   Sloane's most conspicuous problem, however, has been Wilkinson's
enmity. The governor has consistently bashed Sloane as too liberal
for Kentucky voters _ a theme echoed by Brock.
   It is, in fact, about the only direct criticism the soft-spoken
Brock is willing to make. Sloane ``is a fine man and I like him
very much, but I don't think his philosophy is what most
Kentuckians want in Washington,'' Brock said.
   ``I'm running for the United States Senate. I'm not running
against Harvey Sloane.''

   The Census Bureau, under attack for missing
millions of people when it mailed out forms to Americans, is now
dispatching an army of people to count heads.
   An estimated 330,000 enumerators will be making the rounds of
America's houses, apartments and condominiums to count those who
didn't return their census forms.
   ``We will visit each housing unit that did not return a
questionnaire ... and we have the workforce to do it,'' said Census
Bureau Director Barbara Everitt Bryant.
   The workforce is larger than anticipated because of a poorer
than expected return of the mass mailing from the government last
month. Training of the workers who will go America's homes and
apartments begins Monday with the actual counting scheduled to
start Thursday.
   The cost of the door-to-door canvas is expected to add $150
million or more to the price of the census, originally estimated at
$1.3 billion for this year.
   Results of the census will be used to determine congressional
representation for the next decade and the distribution of federal
aid for programs ranging from help for the homeless to funds for
the war on drugs.
   Problems in the initial mailing have caused a chorus of
complaints that the census is being mishandled. Some Americans
simply didn't return their forms. Others _ including one entire
town in California _ never received them in the first place.
   ``It's early in the census process and there is much to be
done,'' said Rep. Thomas Sawyer. D-Ohio, chairman of the House
subcommittee supervising the census.
   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., says the project is on the brink
of disaster and Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., has called for a Senate
investigation.
   The Census Bureau had hoped that 70 percent of Americans would
send back their forms. As of Friday, the rate was only 63 percent,
forcing the bureau to hire more people to continue the count.
   Bryant said that the Bureau has a pool of 1.4 million qualified
job applicants nationwide. That provides more than four people for
each of the 330,000 jobs to be filled, she said.
   Unfortunately, she said, the applicants are not evenly
distributed. There is double the national average available for
each job in New York, for example, but a slight shortage of
available workers on Long Island.
   A study by the General Accounting Office concluded that nearly
half the bureau's local offices had fewer than four applicants for
every job. And the GAO found that pre-census work was slowed by
staff shortages in 15 of the 109 district offices open in 1989.
   In the pre-canvass work developing address lists, for example,
some workers from the Philadelphia area were sent to help in
Newark, N.J. The same occurred in the New York City and Los Angeles
areas.
   To help fill scattered shortages of census workers, Congress has
permitted retired federal workers and military personnel to take
temporary census jobs without losing their retirement benefits.
   In addition, the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs is
permitting residents of subsidized housing to accept census jobs
without the extra income causing their rent to go up. Similar
rulings now apply to recipients of food stamps and other public
assistance.
   Hiring census takers is a particular problem in areas with low
unemployment. Where necessary, the bureau will hire people from
neighboring communities to conduct the count. But, for a variety of
reasons, it prefers relying on local residents.
   First, they are more comfortable walking the halls of large
apartment buildings and along ghetto streets. In addition, they are
more likely to be familiar with local languages and geography and
trusted more by local residents wary of outsiders.
   Using local residents a census takers is considered especially
important in Hispanic areas, where people are afraid that giving
any information to the government will lead to a visit by
immigration officials.
   The Census Bureau has worked hard to stress the confidentiality
of the answers people give and many Hispanic groups have worked to
encourage public cooperation.

   Paul McCartney sang old Beatles
hits for 130,000 fans jammed into Rio's Maracana soccer stadium
Saturday to end a scheduled 33-city tour.
   McCartney performed a number of his own songs, before launching
into ``The Long and Winding Road'' and ``Hey Jude.'' Fans lit
cigarette lighters, cheered wildly, and sang along in ecstasy as
McCartney performed.
   The huge crowd was described as the largest ever to see a
McCartney concert, breaking the previous mark of 80,000. Some
60,000 Brazilians saw McCartney's first Rio show Friday night,
which was marred by heavy rains.
   The show cost $2.9 million, and featured a 100-foot-long stage
packed with more than 20 truckloads of sound equipment, a huge
screen where Beatles scenes and parts of the concert were shown,
and sophisticated laser cannons.
   McCartney said Friday he might extend the tour to Liverpool,
England, in May.

   Flash! A bulletin crackles over Dick
Tracy's two-way wrist radio: ``Dick Tracy is coming home.''
   The chisel-chinned cartoon character and radio message will go
up next week on billboards around this northern Illinois community,
advertising a special premier of the ``Dick Tracy'' movie in the
hometown of the character's creator, Chester Gould.
   On June 13, the film starring Madonna, Warren Beatty, Dustin
Hoffman and Al Pacino will be shown in the century-old Woodstock
Opera House in this town of 13,000 about 50 miles northwest of
Chicago.
   The movie opens around the country two days later.
   Gould began drawing Dick Tracy in 1931 and took up residence at
a farm outside Woodstock four years later. He retired in 1977 and
died in 1985.
   Mayor Jim Shoemaker, who's lived there 30 years, says locals
tell him stories of their children biking to the Gould house and
returning home with cartoons on their clothing.
   ``He would draw right on their T-shirt, and it was just a great
thing he did,'' Shoemaker said in a telephone interview Saturday.
   Woodstock is a town that cherishes its history. Three Academy
Award winners _ Paul Newman, Orson Welles and Geraldine Page _ got
their start in summer stock at the opera house, Shoemaker said.
   So after Gould died, Shoemaker decided to establish a Chester
Gould Memorial Library that would chronicle the cartoonist's career.
   When news of the upcoming ``Dick Tracy'' film was out, some
Woodstockers suggested that a local premier could raise money for
the library, the mayor said. Residents lobbied the Walt Disney
organization, and the premiere was eventually set.

   Author Hunter Thompson, sporting a green
baseball cap emblazoned with a badge, bemoaned his legal problems
and said he is crusading against improper police power.
   ``I'm a kind of fugitive from justice,'' Thompson said in a
30-minute speech at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
   ``I've been anointed as the point man to carry the ball for a
lot of people in the country who thought the police didn't have a
right to come search your home on the word of any informant,'' he
said.
   Thompson faces felony charges in Colorado of possession of
cocaine, LSD, valium, marijuana, dynamite and blasting caps. In a
separate case, Thompson faces a felony charge of using cocaine and
misdemeanor charges of third-degree sexual assault and third-degree
assault.
   Thompson sipped bourbon and smoked cigarettes from a holder
throughout the disjointed address Friday night.
   He rose to fame in the '70s through his books ``Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas'' and ``Fear and Loathing on the Campaign
Trail'' and his articles in Rolling Stone magazine. The author, 52,
is a long-time proponent of the legalization of marijuana and other
drugs.
   After reading the results of an ABC News poll that indicate wide
support for President Bush's anti-drug policy, Thompson repeatedly
urged the crowd to vote and participate in the democratic system to
try to counter law-and-order hysteria.
   But he admitted he has not followed his own advice.
   ``I didn't vote last time. I was way too insulted to vote for a
party of professional losers,'' Thompson said. ``In a democracy, we
do deserve a two-party system, a loyal opposition. But the
Democrats aren't going to do it.''
   Thompson also reflected on his old nemesis, former president
Richard Nixon.
   ``He was fun. He was a crook in his genes, but Nixon was a
player. George Bush is not a player, he's a manager. Bush is not
fun.''

   Robert Polhill visited Beirut on business trips for an
accounting firm and fell in love with the country, his mother
recalled.
   He returned as an assistant professor of business studies at
Beirut University College. On Jan. 24, 1987, he and three other
academics were kidnapped by gunmen posing as policemen.
   Polhill, 55, had lived in Lebanon for four years with his second
wife, Ferial, who is Lebanese.
   His mother, Ruth Polhill, a retired high school librarian who
resides in Fishkill, N.Y., said her son visited Lebanon on one of
his first business trips for a New York City accounting firm.
   ``It was very beautiful,'' she recalled. ``He loved the people.
He loved the campus.''
   Polhill, a diabetic who requires daily medication, attended
Cornell University and graduated from New York University in 1961,
after which he began work as a New York accountant. He was
described as a photography buff, an avid New York Giants fan and a
committed educator.
   ``We are a family that's been touched by teaching,'' said
Polhill's aunt, Lois Bird of East Rochester, N.Y.
   Polhill had two children from a previous marriage - Steven, of
New York City and Brian, a student at the State University of New
York at Binghamton.
   His mother said he told her he was not fearful living on the
Beirut campus. ``Now that's what he tells his mother,'' she said.
``He had all the confidence he's be safe on the Beirut campus.''
   Said son Brian: ``We knew it (kidnapping) was a possibility, but
it wasn't something he put a big accent on. He was extremely
careful. He kept a low profile.''

   Discovery's five astronauts returned
Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASA's most
valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space
Telescope.
   Discovery is scheduled to lift off at 8:31 a.m. EDT Tuesday.
   ``We feel very confident that things are going to go well this
time,'' said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver.
   ``We're going to come out OK on Tuesday morning and, if not,
we'll just keep trying until we do. That's kind of the name of the
game here,'' Shriver said.
   NASA test director Mike Leinbach said Sunday that the countdown
was proceeding smoothly and the shuttle appeared to be in perfect
condition. The countdown got under way Saturday afternoon.
   A faulty power unit forced the first launch attempt to be
scrubbed four minutes before liftoff April 10. The unit was
replaced with a new one, which tests showed to be fine.
   ``Hopefully, we'll get the shuttle off the pad this time,''
Leinbach said.
   A 70 percent chance of favorable weather was expected at launch
time, with low clouds being the main concern, said the Air Force's
Ed Priselac, shuttle weather officer. A weak cold front from the
north was expected to pass through the area by Monday night.
   The outlook is considerably better for Wednesday and Thursday,
Priselac said.
   As Discovery's astronauts arrived from Johnson Space Center in
Houston early Sunday afternoon, the shuttle Columbia was being
transported to a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery.
   It is only the second time both shuttle launch pads at Kennedy
Space Center have been occupied simultaneously. The first time was
in January 1986; 16 days after Columbia lifted off, Challenger
exploded.
   Columbia commander Vance Brand said he does not believe the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration is moving too fast
with his shuttle. NASA expects to launch Columbia with an
astronomical observatory called Astro no earlier than May 16, one
week later than planned because of Discovery's two-week delay.
   ``In some cases, it could be a problem'' having shuttles on both
launch pads, Brand said. ``In this particular case, everything's
fitting together.''
   NASA has until Saturday to get Discovery off the ground. After
that, all launch attempts must be halted for eight days so Hubble's
batteries can be recharged.
   The six nickel-hydrogen batteries will power Hubble from the
time it is disconnected from Discovery's electrical system until
its two energy-collecting solar panels take over in space.
   Discovery's payload bay was sealed late Saturday night,
drastically reducing the risk of contamination to the telescope's
finely polished 94.5-inch mirror.
   Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a
shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper
orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. During Hubble's
15-year journey through space, astronomers expect to look back to
nearly the beginning of time and solve some of the universe's most
perplexing mysteries.
   Astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected by Hubble
and thus provide additional targets for the telescope. The $100
million observatory also will focus during Columbia's nine-day
mission on Comet Austin, believed to be on its first trip through
the solar system.
   Both Hubble and Astro were scheduled for launch in 1986, but
were delayed by the Challenger accident.

   A biography of the elusive Greta Garbo will
finally be published after being locked in a vault for 14 years.
   ``Garbo'' was written by the late novelist and poet Antoni
Gronowicz. Publisher Simon &amp; Schuster said the company acquired the
book in 1976 on the understanding that it would not be published
while the actress was alive. Garbo died April 15 at the age of 84.
   Much of the book is told in Garbo's own words as she talked to
Gronowicz, with whom she became friends in 1938.
   The book ``tells of her relationship with her discoverer, mentor
and lover Mauritz Stiller; and deals with her long and not always
happy years as the greatest and most reluctant of movie queens,''
the publisher said in a statement.
   It also deals with the men in her life, John Gilbert, Robert
Montgomery, Robert Taylor, Charles Boyer, Melvyn Douglas and others.
   ``In the book, Gronowicz also recalls Miss Garbo talking about
the often rumored fact that `women pursued (her) more often and
more persistently' than did men,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Israelis Remember 6 Million Victims Of Nazi Holocaust</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sirens wailed for two minutes throughout Israel
Sunday as life briefly came to a standstill in remembrance of the 6
million Jews slain in the Nazi Holocaust.
   As the sirens sounded at 10 a.m., traffic ground to a halt, and
thousands of Israelis stood silently at attention to honor the
victims.
   Hundreds of Israelis also marked Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes'
Remembrance Day by participating in ceremonies across the country
at which the names of victims were read by relatives and friends.
   According to recent statistics, there are 302,404 Holocaust
survivors living in this nation of 4.7 million people, including
Polish-born Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and other top military
and political leaders.
   ``I remember my family members who have died in those terrible
and fearsome days,'' said Shamir, 74, who lost his parents, two
sisters, their husbands and children during World War II.
   ``My father, Shlomo Ben Yitzhak Ysernitsky, who was killed by
Polish farmers, his friends from childhood, when he came to them
seeking refuge after escaping from a death train,'' he said.
   Leading the main name-reading ceremony outside the Knesset, or
parliament, Shamir then named other Nazi victims _ his mother,
Pearl; his sisters, Miriam and Rivka; their husbands, Mordechai and
Yaakov, and their children.
   The Israeli prime minister, who was born in the Polish town of
Ruzinoy and according to aides has never disclosed full details
about how his family perished, also gave an account of Miriam's
death:
   ``My sister, Miriam, was married to Mordechai Shklarevitch. They
and their children were killed by a forest guard who used to work
for them, when they came to hide in his house.''
   The name-reading program, called ``Unto Every Person There Is A
Name,'' was introduced last year as part of an effort to remind
young people of the Jewish loss in the Holocaust.
   The tragedy still deeply influences private lives and politics
in Israel, reflecting itself in both the right-wing preoccupation
with security precautions and the liberal drive to guard human
rights. But its impact on the younger generation is diminishing.
   Lithuanian-born Parliament Speaker Dov Shilansky, a survivor of
Germany's Dachau concentration camp who lost aunts, uncles and
grandparents to the Nazis, said the name-reading ceremony was also
intended to send a message to the world.
   ``We will never forget. We will always remember. The Holocaust
belongs to the Jewish people, all the Jewish people ... but not
only the Jewish people. The world has to know. If it once happened
to us it can happen to other nations, too,'' said Shilansky, a
member of Shamir's right-wing Likud Bloc.
   Israeli radio and TV stations broadcast interviews with
survivors and historical reviews of the Holocaust.
   Starting at sundown Saturday, entertainment spots and cafes
remained closed for 24 hours in accordance with a 1961 law.
Israel's blue-and-white Star of David flag flew at half-mast on
public buildings.
   The memorial day is observed midway between the anniversary of
the start of the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto revolt against Nazi troops and
Israel's Independence Day, April 30.
   At Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, the siren wailed just as a
large group of Soviet Jewish immigrants arrived on a Hungarian
airliner, the Israeli news agency Itim said.
   The agency said many of the new arrivals wept when told what the
siren signified, and one elderly medal-decorated World War II
veteran froze in a military salute.

   When 52 American hostages were released by
Iran in 1981, a team of 30 doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists
and social workers awaited them in Germany to cushion the shock of
their newly regained freedom.
   Something similar awaits Robert Polhill, a 55-year-old American
educator who was released Sunday by kidnappers in Lebanon after 39
months in captivity. This time the assemblage of experts was given
a name _ the Hostage Reception Team.
   ``We have procedures in place that ensure that appropriate
action is taken in the event that a release takes place,'' State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said last week. But, she
said, ``detailed discussion of these procedures could complicate an
already complex and sensitive situation.''
   The 1981 experience, however, gives a clue to how the hostage
reception team works.
   The experts were gathered at the U.S. Air Force hospital in
Wiesbaden, West Germany. Members were selected for their experience
in treating prisoners of war and civilian hostages and a special
interest in the psychological problems of hostages.
   The team members had studied the medical and psychiatric history
of the hostages before their capture, read copies of letters about
medical matters the hostages had sent form Iran and interviewed
their relatives and physicians.
   There was a special circumstance that dictated reading of the
letters and the interviews: The records of those hostages who were
members of the armed forces were lost when the Iranian Embassy was
captured.
   With a far greater number of hostages to concern them, social
workers had visited family members to evaluate the psychological
support the men could expect on their return home. Others spoke
with the families by telephone or exchanged letters.
   While there is an extensive debriefing process for a hostage
when he or she is able, there is also a briefing process to bring
the hostage up to date.
   Experts say when people are taken hostage, they are thrust into
a dependent infantile state. They must ask permission to move about
and take care of physical necessities. Many hostages respond to
these indignities by developing trust, even gratitude, to their
kidnappers for sparing their lives.
   That apparently wasn't the case in 1981 when the hostages had
been held for 444 days. According to doctors, the Americans were
treated so badly that they showed no signs of the ``Stockholm
Syndrome'' which is a gradual bonding of captors and captives. The
name comes from hostages held by trapped robbers in a Swedish bank
many years ago.
   One reason hostages are held in Wiesbaden for treatment is to
give them a chance to release tensions and to receive advice on how
they might deal with potential emotional problems.
   One doctor on the 1981 team told reporters: ``Our job is being
available to assist the hostages, not to tell them what they should
be thinking.''

   Most Western hostages in Lebanon are
believed held by factions of Hezbollah, or Party of God, a
fundamentalist Shiite Moslem group that gets considerable financial
support from Iran.
   Hezbollah works closely with units of Iranian Revolutionary
Guards, stationed in Lebanon since Israel's 1982 invasion, to build
influence among the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect.
   The factions are believed to be closely linked and may even be
largely the same people using different cover names.
   These are the groups claiming to hold the hostages:
   _ Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, says it has Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
kidnapped March 16, 1985, and Thomas Sutherland, acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut, abducted June 9
of that year. Anderson has been held longest of the Western
hostages.
   It has demanded the release of 17 comrades jailed in Kuwait for
bombing the U.S. and French embassies in December 1983, some of
whom are believed to be relatives of Islamic Jihad members. Two of
the 17 were released after serving five-year prison terms.
   Speculation has arisen that Islamic Jihad also kidnapped
Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, who disappeared Jan. 23, 1987,
after leaving his hotel in Moslem west Beirut to negotiate for the
release of American hostages. No claim of kidnapping has been made.
   _ Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine on Sunday freed
Robert Polhill, who was a lecturer in accounting when kidnapped
along with two other Americans from the U.S.-affiliated Beirut
University College on Jan. 24, 1987. The group claims to hold the
two others: Alann Steen, a communications teacher, and Jesse
Turner, a visiting professor of mathematics and computer science.
   It demands the release of Palestinian and Shiite Lebanese
prisoners in Israel.
   _ The Revolutionary Justice Organization claimed responsibility
for kidnapping Americans Joseph Cicippio, acting comptroller of the
American University of Beirut, on Sept. 12, 1986, and Edward Tracy,
a self-styled writer, on Oct. 19, 1986.
   Statements from the organization threatened the men's lives
twice in 1988 _ in retaliation for the U.S. Navy's downing of an
Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf in July and if foreign
soldiers were sent to Lebanon because of problems over the election
of a president in September.
   _ The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed
responsibility for kidnapping Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins on
Feb. 17, 1988, while he served with a U.N. truce observer force,
and said on July 31, 1989, he had been hanged. A videotape was
released July 31, 1989, showing his body hanging from a gallows.
   _ Arab Revolutionary Cells-Omar Mukhtar Brigades said it
kidnapped Frank Reed, the American director of the Lebanese
International School, on Sept. 9, 1986.
   _ Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems, believed to
be a cover name for a faction of Palestinian terrorist mastermind
Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council, claimed to have abducted
Alec Collett, a British journalist on assignment for a U.N. agency.
   Collett was kidnapped March 25, 1985, and the group said April
23, 1986, that it hanged him because of British support for U.S.
air raids on Libya eight days earlier. A videotape was released,
showing a body hanging from a scaffold, but no corpse has been
found.
   _ Cells of Armed Struggle claimed to have abducted Jack Mann, a
Briton decorated as a fighter pilot in World War II, on May 12,
1989.
   Seven other Westerners are missing and believed kidnapped, but
no organizations have claimed responsibility.

<HEAD>Oklahoma Walkout Seen as National Trend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON JENKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a militant show of solidarity unique
in this conservative state: thousands of sign-toting school
teachers marching on the state Capitol in what could be a sign of
the times for the nation.
   They came by the busload from Tulsa, from Henryetta, from
Hooker, from Caney Valley and dozens of points in between with a
single message to legislators: pass House Bill 1017.
   The protest worked. Late Thursday, the Oklahoma Senate approved
the bill, a $230 million education and tax package, ending a
legislative battle that began eight months ago when Gov. Henry
Bellmon called a special session.
   Officials say it was a unique coalition of labor and business
that in the end got the bill approved and may have helped establish
a national trend.
   Called by the 31,000-member Oklahoma Education Association, the
walkout produced demonstrations at the Capitol by more than 10,000
teachers each day.
   Bellmon said he would sign the education bill this week, making
Oklahoma a leader in education reform. One senator said the bill
will make sure the state is not be ``a Third World state'' in
teacher pay.
   Oklahoma teachers, with an average pay of $22,000 a year, rank
48th. The national average is $29,648.
   The strike closed hundreds of schools, affecting more than
300,000 of the state's 572,000 students. But it did not produce the
citizen backlash many expected, including Bellmon. The governor,
who initially asked the attorney general for a way to prevent the
walkout, said teachers had ``a very constructive impact.''
   Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
joined the picket line Thursday. He said Oklahoma is the fourth
state this school year where teachers have held walkouts. The
others were West Virginia, Utah and Washington.
   ``I think this means frustration is built up so much that the
lid is popping off all over,'' Geiger said. ``I don't think we have
seen the end of this. I would not be surprised to see more
strikes.''
   While the teachers demonstrated outside, business, farm and
civic groups walked the halls inside the Capitol, seeking the final
votes needed to attach the emergency clause to the bill.
   The emergency clause, which would make the bill effective
immediately upon the governor's signature, had been the stumbling
block to the stalemate.
   Dick Rush, president of the Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce,
said it was ``the first major bill of any depth'' to answer
President Bush's call at his national education summit last year.
   Rush said he expects similar coalitions to develop in other
states as leaders realize the necessity to improve educational
systems to compete in a global society that puts a premium on
technology.
   Many school administrators backed the teacher's efforts and some
even joined the picket lines.
   ``What you're seeing here is five years of built-up feelings,''
said Weldon Davis, a former OEA president who is now an assistant
principal in the Oklahoma City school system.
   Davis said it had been five years since Oklahoma teachers had
received significant money for pay raises from the Legislature. The
state is still recovering from an economic decline that began in
the early 1980s with the collapse of the oil boom.
   Bellmon, a Republican, criticized members of his own party for
taking a traditional anti-tax stand and voting against the bill in
the Senate, calling it ``a terrible political blunder.''
   He said he hopes a citizens group does not go ahead with its
threat to launch an initiative drive to overturn the plan because
of objections to the tax provisions.
   The bill passed as an emergency measure, 32-14, after five
Democratic senators changed their votes. Twelve of the 13
Republicans present voted against the bill.
   The education package calls for raising $230 million by
increasing sales and income taxes. A one-half cent increase in the
4-cent state sales tax increase would raise $104 million as would a
10 percent increase in personal income taxes. An increase in the
corporate tax from 5 percent to 6 percent would produce $22 million.
   It increases funds for teachers' salaries, special education,
programs for disadvantaged students and technological innovations.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II announced
plans Sunday for an unprecedented European-wide meeting of bishops
to discuss spreading the church's message across the continent
after the fall of Communist regimes.
   A spokesman also disclosed that the Roman Catholic leader would
visit Cuba in December.
   At an outdoor Mass later in Bratislava, which drew several
hundred thousand faithful on a rain-drenched field, the pope lauded
the perseverance of Roman Catholics and gave special thanks to
Czechoslovakia's youth, who sparked the peaceful November
revolution.
   ``I am thinking of the young people, whom others tried to lead
astray, but who did not lose their thirst for truth, justice and
love, and who, in the light of such values, became the agents of
recent changes,'' he said.
   The 69-year-old pontiff, ending a two-day tour of
Czechoslovakia, left for Rome later Sunday from Bratislava, 35
miles northeast of Vienna.
   He was seen off by Prime Minister Marian Calfa, who said the
visit had ``strenghtened the feeling of togetherness in all of us.''
   The pope made his announcement of a synod as he visited a
Moravian shrine in the city of Velehrad, 90 miles from Bratislava.
The shrine was dedicated to Cyril and Methodius, two patron saints
of Europe.
   ``We could find no better occasion for an announcement that
intimately concerns this continent, which throughout the centuries
has been torn by wars, but also blessed with a presence and work of
countless saints who sowed the gospel seeds far and wide,'' he said.
   John Paul said the synod, a deliberative body, will be held ``at
a not-too-distant date.''
   Papal spokesmen Joaquin Navarro said he did not expect it would
be held this year but said details will be announced in Rome on
Tuesday.
   ``To my mind the agenda for the synod will be huge. It will be
the first such European church summit bringing together bishops
from every country on the continent,'' Navarro said.
   Europe has about 1,000 of the world's 3,000 bishops. The synod
apparently will map strategy to meet the pope's vision of a Europe
united on the basis of its Christian roots, rejecting the
materialist Communist concepts that prevailed in the East as well
as the consumeristic-minded Western model.
   Navarro also said the pope had accepted a invitation to visit
the Caribbean island country, ruled by Fidel Castro's hard-line
Communist government.
   The spokesman said the pope is going before Christmas, but the
exact date in December is not set.
   Since European Communist regimes started crumbling last year,
the Vatican has been moving quickly to expand its influence in the
region.
   The pope's native Poland was the first to restore diplomatic
relations with the Holy See. That country's first post-war
non-communist premier, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, attended the papal Mass
in Velehrad and kissed the pontiff's ring.
   Mazowiecki is a Catholic intellectual and was a longtime adviser
to Solidarity, the movement inspired in part by the pope that
launched the wave of change in the East.
   After celebrating a Mass at Velehrad attended by some 200,000
people, the pope flew on to Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, for
another huge open-air service that was the final big event of his
trip.
   Attending the outdoor Mass in Bratislava was Deputy Prime
Minister Jan Carnogursky, a Slovak and emerging leader of the
increasingly ambitious Christian Democratic Movement which is
expected to do well in upcoming parliamentary elections June 8-9.
   The movement was expected to reap political benefits from the
pope's visit, and Carnogursky even performed a reading during the
Mass.
   Also prominent at the service was parliament Speaker Alexander
Dubcek, the former Communist Party leader whose 1968 ``Prague
spring'' reforms prompted the Warsaw Pact invasion of
Czechoslovakia and restoration of hard-line policies.
   Statistics released by the Vatican estimate 10.7 million
Catholics live in the country of 15.6 million.
   The trip was the pope's 46th foreign tour. Next month he is to
visit Mexico and Malta and he plans a tour of Africa in September,
in addition to the Cuban stop in December.

<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the dim light of a super-secure
command bunker, Army Lt. Col. John W. Wilson paced, chin on chest,
listening to an intelligence report on a Soviet submarine off the
California coast.
   An instant later, as he glanced up at an illuminated global
``chessboard'' of U.S. and Sviet military forces, Wilson stopped
short. A voice near him cried, ``BSTS alert.'' An early-warning
satellite was signaling the launch of a nuclear missile.
   Wilson had the comfort of knowing this was only a ``war game''
simulation, but voices in the control center carried a serious tone
from the moment a U.S. surveillance plane over the Pacific reported
spotting a missile booster surging toward the surface.
   For Wilson, it was time to start thinking about doomsday and how
to escape.
   He sent word to the White House: ``We have a detected launch off
the West Coast.''
   Then, nearly as abruptly as the ``attack'' had begun, it was
over. Minutes after the count of incoming Soviet missiles reached
15, and before the warheads could hit their targets in the
southwestern United States, all were destroyed in a space- and
land-based rocket barrage orchestrated from Wilson's bunker.
   The ``crisis'' was a computer-simulated nuclear attack. It was
not the all-out assault that America has spent trillions of dollars
trying to deter throughout the Cold War, but a small-scale launch
by a rogue Soviet submarine commander.
   The scenario, played out for reporters recently at the Army's
Strategic Defense Command, dramatizes the new rationale being
promoted by the Bush administration for investing billions in a
Star Wars missile defense at a time when even the Pentagon
acknowledges that the threat of World War III is the lowest in 40
years.
   Instead of the impregnable, worldwide shield against a massive
wave of Soviet missiles _ as originally envisioned by Ronald Reagan
seven years ago _ promoters of the Strategic Defense Initiative say
a more modest defense is needed, one that still would put weapons
in space at a cost of about $55 billion but would be capable of
knocking out only half of the Soviets' main intercontinental
ballistic missile force.
   The new rationale also stresses a need to protect against an
accidental or unauthorized Soviet launch or a limited missile
attack by a Third World country.
   Gone is Reagan's talk of making nuclear weapons ``impotent and
obsolete.'' The aim now is to improve the traditional role of
offensive nuclear forces as a deterrent to war by making the odds
of a successful first strike even more uncertain.
   Gone, at least for the remainder of this century, are ideas of
using exotic and futuristic weaponry, such as the X-ray laser and
particle beam weapon, that originally gave SDI the Star Wars
nickname. The new emphasis is on more down-to-earth, rapidly
maturing technology such as kinetic-energy warheads that ``kill''
their targets in space by ramming them at high speed.
   Gone, too, is much of the interest in Congress for financing the
project. Last year, for the first time, the SDI budget was lower
than in the year before. Today it's an easy target of politicians
looking to harvest a post-Cold War ``peace dividend.''
   ``SDI is public enemy No. 1 on Capitol Hill,'' Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., said recently.
   Says Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., who supports a scaled-down
SDI research budget but not deployment: ``Congress hasn't voted to
produce it and probably never will.''
   Bush has told the Pentagon he wants to be able to decide by 1992
whether to deploy a Star Wars defense, but he probably won't get
the chance by then. Officials and scientists working on the project
say they'll need a healthy increase in funds _ well above what
Congress seems likely to grant _ next year and in 1992 to lay a
sound technical foundation on which Bush could base his decision.
   Lt. Gen. Robert D. Hammond, commander of the Strategic Defense
Command that handles about one-third of the Star Wars research,
told reporters recently that he believed Bush could meet his target
date for a deployment decision ``only if you have good growth'' in
financing beyond the $3.8 billion authorized for this year.
   Bush has requested a $1 billion increase for next year, but it
appears unlikely he'll get anything close to that. He and the
Pentagon may have to live with less.
   From the start, more than seven years and $19 billion ago, the
project was designed as a long-term effort, with little prospect
for payoff before the turn of the century. But political pressure
to show results grew as policymakers wondered: Can it work? Is it
affordable? Will the Soviets find a way around it?
   All three are still open questions.
   The main pieces of a Star Wars system, as currently envisioned,
are sensors to detect and track enemy missiles from their launch
silos; land- and space-based rockets to attack the missiles in
flight, and computers to manage the battle.
   Of those three elements, the computer technology is perhaps the
most problematic.
   At the Strategic Defense Command in Hunstville, where Wilson and
his team of specialists test their responses to simulated nuclear
attacks, engineers are still experimenting with computer programs
that would be used to orchestrate a Star Wars response to a real
attack.
   Lawrence Tubbs, acting chief of battle management at the
Strategic Defense Command, said the key questions about the
computer software are: Can it be adequately tested, and would it
work?
   Some scientists say the answer to both is no.
   ``The problem of developing trustworthy software for the SDI is
not a problem that will be solved in our lifetimes or those of our
children,'' the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
wrote in an open letter to Congress on Feb. 16.
   The scientists group urged the abandonment of SDI, arguing that
a single error in the system's software could cause a complete
system failure under unpredictable circumstances.
   It appears unlikely Star Wars will be killed any time soon, if
only because of its economic lure. About 28,000 people are working
on the project at defense contractors, national laboratories,
universities and military installations in every state in the
nation and in five foreign countries.
   Two aerospace companies, Boeing Co. and Lockheed Corp., together
have taken in $2.2 billion in Star Wars contracts over the life of
the program, according to Pentagon figures. That is more than 10
percent of all Star Wars spending. Altogether, more than 1,000
military contractors have a piece of Star Wars action.
   The project's supporters say the American public will support
more research if they get the message that the goal of ballistic
missile defense is attainable.
   Lt. Gen. George Monahan, director of the SDI project,
acknowledged in testimony to a House panel April 4 that much more
work was needed to put the Star War pieces together, but he said
many scientific question marks have been erased.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the technology is here,
sufficient to develop and deploy such a system,'' he said.

   They came from all over to try the Scream
Machine, the Z Force, and the Georgia Cyclone. The Mind Bender got
a pass, because as roller coasters go, it's no big thing.
   The Cyclone was getting most of the attention from about 450
members of the American Coaster Enthusiasts at their annual outing.
   ``Wood is a living, organic thing. Here, standing in the middle
of this one, it's like being in the heart of a great beast,'' said
Randy Geisler of St. Paul, Minn., president of the 3,500-member
organization.
   The enthusiasts were out in the fog Saturday night testing the
Cyclone, a new-style, old-fashioned wooden roller coaster at Six
Flags Over Georgia.
   ``It's absolutely dynamite,'' said David Schini of Naples, Fla.,
who with his wife, Elizabeth, had ``driven 11 hours to ride this
thing.''
   ``This one, it takes all the old-fashioned thrills and adds the
modern technology,'' Schini said.
   The Georgia Cyclone combines the speed of a big, wooden roller
coaster with the twisting, banked turns of a steel coaster.
   ``To me, one of the most important things is the visual effect
of it _ white scaffolding, deep dips. The coaster will lift you off
your seat _ coaster riders call it `air time,''' said Glenn Allen
of Ocala, Fla.
   The 1 minute, 48 second, ride reaches a top speed of 50 mph.
   ``It's one of the great things about wooden roller coasters.
About all the members like the wooden roller coasters better,''
Allen said.

   A firefighter, trained to rescue people
from burning buildings, had to tap new talents to ``rescue'' a
19-pound lobster from a grocery store tank.
   The monster lobster ended up on display in an Edmond grocery
store after a well-meaning friend shipped it to Max Raydon,
president of the Homeland grocery store chain in Oklahoma.
   ``We went through kind of a mess trying to figure out what to do
with it,'' said Scott Stelfox, assistant manager of the chain's
Edmond store.
   The lobster, estimated to be 100 years old, was finally placed
in the store's lobster tank. ``We didn't have much choice,'' even
though the tank wasn't designed to hold even one 19-pound lobster,
Stelfox said.
   Most of the lobsters sold to shoppers are about 1{ pounds.
   Firefighter Cody Barger heard about the lobster from his wife,
who saw it in the tank while shopping.
   Barger, a diver with an interest in marine animals, began
looking for a home for lobster. Neither the Oklahoma City Zoo nor
the Tulsa zoo had a place for it. Finally, the staff at Florida's
Sea World agreed to adopt him.
   ``They just opened a lobster display and they only have a
7-pound lobster in it,'' Barger said.
   The lobster was shipped to its new home Friday.
   Despite his size, the Oklahoma lobster, who actually came from
Boston, isn't nearly big enough to make the record books. The
largest known lobster lives in a museum in Maine. It weighs 58
pounds and is estimated to be 300 years old.

<TEXT>
   East Germans gathered near the broken Berlin
Wall Sunday to call attention to one of the world's most polluted
nations, and to exult in their new freedom to do something about it.
   Green tents and fluttering banners marking Earth Day covered
three blocks of a promenade leading to the historic Brandenburg
Gate and a crumbled section of wall that splits the former main
square of old Berlin.
   Thousands strolled past environmental exhibits, painted pictures
of trees on a huge canvas, and quietly debated whether unification
with West Germany would help or hurt the effort to clean up the
country's fouled air and tainted water.
   It was a far cry from the days when environmentalists held
secret meetings in church basements, poring over books and
magazines banned by Communist authorities.
   ``They were the days when the secret police would restrict our
ability to travel, hold up our mail, anything to create
psychological fear,'' said Falk Zimmerman, director of East
Germany's Ark environmental movement.
   Today, the movement is a ubiquitous presence in East Germany,
home to the Green Party, the Green League and the Green Ecological
Network, among others.
   East Germany is a huge producer, user and exporter of lignite,
or brown coal. The deep excavation of it has fouled huge supplies
of groundwater, and the use of it as an energy source by outmoded
factories has polluted the air, said Green Ecological Network water
specialist Michael Bender.
   ``You ask me what the worst problem here is, and that would be
brown coal,'' he said. ``But really, I do not know where to begin.''
   A Greens-led alliance won eight seats in the 400-member
parliament that was chosen by voters in the nation's first free
elections on March 18, which followed the ouster of the hard-line
Communist regime in October.
   Environmentalists here hope the infusion of Western industrial
technology will improve an environment spoiled by archaic East bloc
manufacturing processes.
   But some fear the rush to lure investment and the anxiousness of
East Germans for good jobs will push environmental concerns aside.
   ``I think the environment is in for worse trouble here,'' said
West Berliner Raymond Lenz, 34, as his 5-year-old daughter, Annika,
painted a picture of a tree on a huge maze of canvas cloth. ``I
think the people here want jobs more anything else.''

   So many American hostages have
passed through the U.S. Air Force hospital here after their release
that it has been dubbed ``Freedom Hall.''
   The hospital in Wiesbaden has been used since 1981, when 52
American hostages were debriefed there after they were freed from
444 days of captivity in Iran.
   It has been used because of its proximity to the Rhein-Main Air
Base, about about 20 miles to the east, where aircraft returning
from the Middle East have landed.
   Hostages are give full medical, dental and mental health
examinations and are asked to recount their experiences by a
special team from the U.S. State Department, which has been in
Wiesbaden since the middle of last week.
   Most of the hostages have talked to the news media during their
stay at the hospital. Occasionally relatives have joined them there.
   Mental health workers from a military medical team are usually
the first group to greet the returning captives.
   The hospital also was used for the 39 Americans held on a
hijacked TWA jetliner in Lebanon in June 1985.
   Some of the former hostages from Iran donated a plaque that now
hangs in a section of the hospital known as ``Freedom Hall,'' the
U.S. military newspaper Stars and Stripes reported recently.
   The last hostage to pass through the debriefing and examination
process was Mithileshwar Singh, an Indian citizen and U.S.
resident, who was freed in 1988 from captivity in Beirut.

<HEAD>Solidarity Calls For New Elections in Poland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Solidarity trade union on Sunday urged
the government to step up the pace of reform and called for new
elections to remove Communist holdovers from office.
   A tersely worded resolution approved in a 298-18 vote by
delegates to Solidarity's second national congress demanded that
new elections be held by spring 1991.
   The resolution said that ``the present composition of the
parliament elected in June 1989 does not reflect the real
arrangement of forces in the country.''
   It also called for direct elections of the president. The
incumbent president, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, was elected by
parliament last year.
   Parliamentary elections are not formally scheduled until 1993
and Jaruzelski's six-year term runs until 1995. Elections could be
held earlier under an overhaul of the constitution now under way.
   In an implicit criticism of the government of Primer Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity adviser, the resolution
said economic and political reforms must be carried out more
quickly.
   As Poland transforms from a centrally planned socialist economy
to a market-oriented capitalist system, the government has
introduced a shock therapy economic austerity program that has
reduced inflation but so far has put 200,000 people out of work.
   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa has said the Mazowiecki
government has not moved quickly enough to remove Communists from
government ministries and key economic management posts.
   The resolution was approved on the fourth day of the union's
congress, as delegates continued to debate Solidarity's role in
post-Communist Poland.
   It reflects the belief among many Solidarity activists that
Poland is now lagging behind other Eastern European countries in
introducing reforms aimed at removing the last vestiges of
Communist rule.
   Hungary and East Germany have already held free multiparty
elections in which the Communists were overwhelmingly defeated.
Multiparty voting is scheduled for later this spring in
Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.
   Poland's partially free parliamentary elections last June were
part of a historic and, at the time, unprecedented power-sharing
compromise with Communist authorities.
   In the elections, the Solidarity-led opposition was allowed to
compete for 35 percent of the seats in the lower house of
parliament and all the seats in the newly created Senate.
   Solidarity won all but one of the seats it could compete for and
went on to form a new alliance with two smaller, formerly
pro-Communist parties to take control of the government.
   Parliament chose Mazowiecki to head the government as prime
ministe, but chose Jaruzelski for the presidency. Jaruzelski, the
former Communist Party leader, led the December 1981 martial law
crackdown that suppressed Solidarity. The union regained its legal
status in April 1989.
   Walesa said earlier this month that he would run for president,
but later backed away from declaring his candidacy.
   The 47-year-old former electrician and Nobel Peace Prize
laureate was overwhelmingly re-elected Saturday as chairman of the
union he has led since its birth during a nationwide strike wave in
1980.
   A key issue facing Solidarity is whether it should continue to
play a major role in national politics or place more emphasis on
traditional trade union concerns defending workers' interests.
   Walesa has advocated a mixed approach, and delegates appear to
be going along with him by forging a compromise that would allow
the union to remain active in politics without neglecting workers'
issues.

   President Bush expressed support for a
tanker-free zone off the Florida coast Sunday and told activists
they ``won't be too disappointed'' with his upcoming decision on
oil drilling off the Florida Keys.
   Bush said he would push for a ruling by the International
Maritime Organization in London that the waters within 10 miles of
the Florida Keys are a protected zone to be avoided by big ships.
   The president made the Earth Day announcement in Islamorada, a
resort community on Upper Matecumbe Key, before taking off for
another day of fishing _ this time with sportscaster Curt Gowdy.
   The veteran broadcaster was filming the presidential fishing
trip for the American Sportsman.
   The area Bush wants protected from shipping stretches about 200
miles, from Key Biscayne near Miami to the Dry Tortugas about 70
miles west of Key West. The designation of that area as an
avoidance zone would apply to vessels larger than 150 feet in
length.
   Although international shipping interests are not legally bound
to honor such designations, most respect them and keep their
distance. In this case, the avoidance zone would mostly affect
westbound ships, many of them tankers, that until now have hugged
the Keys reef in order to avoid eastbound Gulf Stream currents in
the Florida Straits.
   After three wayward cargo vessels ran aground on the fragile
reef within a short period last fall, Florida's governor asked the
U.S. Coast Guard to propose the zone. The proposal will be
considered in London in September.
   Bush also took time on Earth Day to give his 123rd ``point of
light'' award to founders of Key West-based Reef Relief, a group
that works to protect the only living coral reef in continental
U.S. waters.
   During the public presentation, Bush hinted to Reef Relief
founder Craig Quirolo that he might support a ban sought by the
group and others on oil drilling off the Florida Keys.
   ``The Exxon Valdez disaster has made us all painfully aware of
the ecological devastation which can result from a major oil
spill,'' the president said.

   The memory of the 35 students killed in
the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 will endure as long as Syracuse
University stands, the chancellor said Sunday as the school
dedicated a memorial to the students.
   More than 600 people, including the families of the victims,
gathered at the heart of campus to watch the university unveil
``The Place of Remembrance'' for the students.
   The centerpiece of the memorial is a 4-foot-high, semicircular
limestone wall. The names of the students are engraved in an
18-inch granite band around the top.
   The 35 students, returning from a semester studying overseas,
were killed Dec. 21, 1988, when a terrorist bomb destroyed the
jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. All 259 people aboard the plane
were killed, and 11 Lockerbie residents were killed by falling
wreckage.
   The memorial wall sits in a bricked plaza at the entrance to the
university in front of the Hall of Languages, the school's oldest
building. The pathway leading to the The Place of Remembrance is
lined by double rows of pear trees and heather.
   ``For the next generations of entering students who look upon
The Place of Remembrance ... they will know that the students who
were lost will be remembered so long as this university shall
stand,'' said Chancellor Melvin Eggers.
   ``Students, class after class, will gather at this place, talk
to one another, and feel the message that those who have gone ahead
have sent _ a message of high academic standards, of being involved
in campus life and of appreciating one's fellow students,'' Eggers
said.
   The ceremony followed an interfaith service at Syracuse's
Hendricks Chapel.
   Robert Berrell Sr., whose son, Steven, died in the Flight 103
bombing, said the dedication ceremony helped switch everyone's
focus ``back to the victims who died, instead of the victims who
lived.''
   Allison Gordon, president of the Student Government Association,
spoke of the enduring lesson learned from the passing of her
friends.
   ``Those that we lost were called students,'' Gordon said. ``Yet,
ironically, I have learned a lesson that will follow me through
life more than anything I've learned in a book. ...
   ``I've learned that life cannot be measured on a ruler stick
marked by years, but rather that life should be measured on a ruler
stick marked by experiences.''

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunshots hit two Greyhound buses over the
weekend, but there were no injuries in the latest violence against
the strike-plagued bus line, authorities said Sunday.
   A bus bound for Philadelphia on U.S. 322 east of Lewiston in
central Pennsylvania was hit by a bullet on the driver's side above
a baggage door at 6:15 p.m. Saturday, said Greyhound spokesman
George Gravley.
   The second shooting occurred at 5:15 a.m. Sunday on Interstate
81 just north of Harrisburg. A bullet struck the right side of a
bus traveling from Pittsburgh to New York, Gravley said.
   The FBI is investigating the shootings, said state Trooper
Charles McBreen in Harrisburg.
   Gravley said 36 buses and three terminals have been damaged by
gunfire since the strike against the country's only nationwide bus
system began March 2.
   About 6,300 drivers represented by the Amalgamated Transit Union
and 3,000 maintenence and office workers went on strike. Greyhound
has continued to operate with 515 union drivers who crossed picket
lines and 2,300 new drivers, Gravley said.
   Calls to union headquarters in Washington on Sunday were not
answered.
   The union has denied any involvement in previous shootings, and
cites examples of what it says is violence against strikers. One
striker was killed early in the walkout when he was hit by a bus
while walking a picket line; it was ruled an accident.
   Greyhound is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading
to the conviction of anyone for shooting a Greyhound bus or
terminal.
   The company has vowed not to hold any talks until a week goes by
without any strike-related violence.

   President Bush thanked Syria and Iran on
Sunday for helping win freedom for an American hostage in Lebanon
but said his feeling of satisfaction was ``substantially tempered''
because other U.S. citizens and Westeners are still in captivity.
   ``I'm not making gestures. I don't trade for hostages,'' he said
when asked whether the release of Robert Polhill would trigger a
tangible expression of his policy of ``goodwill begets goodwill.''
Bush said nothing short of the release of all hostages would
satisfy him.
   ``That's the ground rules,'' he said earlier in the day.
``That's the bottom line.''
   Bush was fishing off the Florida Keys when he got word that
Polhill had been released to Syrian custody. Spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater issued a statement in Bush's name and stressed time and
again that the only U.S. response would be to press for the release
of the remaining hostages.
   ``We would hope that this release would be the forerunner to the
release of others and would pave the way towards the goodwill
begets goodwill summation at some point,'' said Fitzwater. ``But at
this point, with seven hostages still in captivity, the situation
has not changed a great deal.''
   Bush spoke with Polhill and his wife by phone, and said, ``This
is mission uncompleted.'' He said a night does not pass without his
thinking of the American hostages, adding, ``I do not have
forgiveness in my heart as long as one American is held against his
will.''
   Earlier in the day, Bush reiterated that any response would
await release ``of all the hostages.'' He called hostage-taking
``an immoral practice'' that ``has to stop.''

<HEAD>Infant Girl Surviving With Heart Of Brain-Dead Twin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Doctors have saved the life of a baby girl
born with a fatal heart defect by giving her the heart of her
brain-dead twin brother.
   The heart was transplanted into Alison Page Whisman's chest four
days after the twins were born on April 10, doctors said Sunday.
   Her doctors said they believe this is the first case of a heart
transplant between infant twins.
   ``Some people have the joy and then experience the sorrow; we
had the sorrow first and now we have our joy,'' said the twins'
father, Timothy Whisman.
   Page _ as her parents call her _ was born one minute before her
brother, Tyler. He was brain dead, asphyxiated in the womb just
before his birth, doctors said.
   Page appeared strong at delivery, but doctors discovered the
heart defect within 12 hours of her birth.
   Dr. Randall Caldwell, medical director of the Riley pediatric
cardiac transplantation program, confirmed that she had hypoplastic
left heart syndrome, a fatal congenital abnormality that occurs in
about one in 6,000 births.
   Without help, infants with the condition die within 15 days.
Drugs postpone death for about 45 days.
   Researchers don't know what causes hypoplastic left heart
syndrome, doctors said. The deformity occurs at about four to nine
weeks after conception, when the heart begins forming.
   ``While we at Riley did further evaluation of Page's cardiac
status, Tyler stayed out at Humana where they continued the
neurological work and found out he was indeed brain dead. By then,
the parents had been asked that Tyler be allowed to donate
organs,'' Caldwell said.
   It was the Whismans who had the idea for a transplant between
the twins.
   ``I remember thinking, `Wouldn't it be remarkable if Tyler could
help his little sister?''' said the twins' mother, Paula.
   ``Both of our kids were sick. Poor little Tyler with his body
was brain dead. Page's only chance was a heart transplant,''
Whisman said.
   The Whismans also decided to donate Tyler's liver to a
Pennsylvania newborn.
   Page is currently in the newborn intensive care unit. She is
hooked to a heart-lung monitor next to her tray-like plastic bed.
   The Whismans have been told that if Page continues improving
they could expect to take her home within three weeks.

<HEAD>Mandela Calls For Intensified Armed Struggle to Spur Negotiations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UMTATA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela called Sunday for an
intensified armed struggle against the white minority government as
a means of speeding up negotiations on the end of apartheid.
   ``There can be no talk of a lasting peace while government
agents continue to massacre people,'' Mandela said, referring to
three recent incidents of police firing on black demonstrators or
hitting bystanders while shooting at rioters.
   But Mandela told a crowd estimated at 70,000 in the capital of
Transkei, the homeland where he was born, that ``only successful
negotiations can convince us to end the armed struggle, and peace
will come as a result of negotiations. It is not negotiations which
will come as a result of peace.''
   President F.W. de Klerk, whose Cabinet will hold talks with a
Mandela-led African National Congress delegation next month, has
said the ANC's continued calls for armed struggle are an obstacle
to formal negotiations on a new constitution which would give the
black majority the vote.
   De Klerk said in an interview broadcast on British television
Sunday that he was ``strongly opposed to war talk. Even if it's
just rhetoric, I regard that as a stumbling block in the way of
negotiations which must be removed before real negotiations can
take place.''
   Mandela, the ANC's deputy president, said he has spoken to de
Klerk on the telephone about continuing use of violence against
black demonstrators, and would contact him before the May 2-4 talks
to make sure they stayed on track.
   The ANC postponed the talks, which were to have occurred this
week, in protest against the police shooting at Sebokeng on March
26 in which at least 11 black marchers were killed. De Klerk
ordered a judicial inquiry into that case.
   Mandela said the clashes with police showed the ANC's guerrilla
wing, which he helped found, was still needed. The ANC's urban
bombing campaign ended in August, but grenade and bomb attacks on
police and black officials have continued, mostly in rural areas.
   ``The armed struggle must be intensified, but in a disciplined
way, to ensure that the government does not backtrack from the path
of negotiation,'' Mandela told the rally in Umtata, capital of the
Xhosa homeland.
   Mandela said the ANC would not discard any of its strategies and
he hoped to discuss the need for maintaining economic sanctions in
a meeting in July with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
London. Mrs. Thatcher has opposed most sanctions against South
Africa, arguing they would hurt the country's black majority more
than the white minority.
   The Observer newspaper in London quoted Mandela as saying he
hoped to meet Mrs. Thatcher on his way home from a visit to the
United States, where he would hold talks with President Bush.
   Mandela was visiting his tribal homeland for the first time
since 1956, the South African Broadcasting Corp. said. He was
arrested in 1962 and was freed Feb. 11 after serving 27 years in
prison.
   While in Transkei, Mandela intends to visit his home village,
Qunu, and pay respects at the graves of seven relatives who died
during his imprisonment.
   South Africa declared Transkei an independent republic in 1976
under the rule of Mandela's cousins, Kaiser and George Matanzima,
but no other country recognizes it. A series of coups in 1987 led
to the Matanzimas ouster by Maj. Gen. Bantu Holomisa, who has
promised a referendum on re-incorporating Transkei into South
Africa.

   China on Sunday honored the 120th anniversary of
Lenin's birth and joined Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
criticizing those who believe the Russian revolutionary's theories
have become outdated.
   ``Most unforgettable is his outstanding courage, extraordinary
talent and immortal achievements with which he ... creatively
developed Marxism,'' China's People's Daily said in a front-page
editorial.
   The Communist Party newspaper said the founder of Bolshevism
will always stay with the peoples of the Soviet Union, China and
the world.
   ``To belittle Lenin, belittle Leninism and advocate the theory
that Leninism is out of date is the prominent expression of the
ideological trend of bourgeois liberalization,'' it said.
   ``Bourgeois liberalism'' is the party's label for liberal
Western ideas, which are now banned in China.
   Since crushing a student-led reform movement last year, China
has taken a hard-line Communist approach, even as pro-democracy
movements in Eastern Europe drove orthodox Communist governments
from power and Gorbachev proceeded with his program of
market-oriented economic reforms.
   On Friday night, Gorbachev complained of ``slander'' against
Lenin in a speech to a holiday gala at the Bolshoi Theater in
Moscow.
   ``Disrespect for Lenin is unacceptable,'' he told the gathering.
   Gorbachev's remarks and a series of impassioned defenses of
Lenin in the Soviet press last week appeared aimed largely at
lawmaker Yuri Afanasyev and his backers. Afanasyev, speaking to the
Soviet Congress on March 12 blamed Lenin for founding a policy of
``state terror,'' violence and lawlessness.
   Vladimir I. Lenin died in 1924, only seven years after he led
the Bolsheviks to power, wiped out all opposition and began
nationalizing the Russian economy. He emphasized absolute party
power and rigid discipline within the party, key themes of China's
current leaders.
   ``He especially stressed that party leadership must be
maintained in the revolution and construction and pointed out that
all political and economic work ... Should be led by the vanguard
with working class consciousness _ the Communist Party,'' the
People's Daily editorial said.
   China has raised ideological purity and political loyalty to a
point not seen since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   The People's Daily also reported the publication of a lengthy
new guide to Mao Tse-tung's thought. The writings of Communist
China's founder, largely ignored during the 1980s as the nation
concentrated on rapid economic development, have made a comeback in
the past year.
   China also marked Lenin's anniversary by coming out with 43
volumes of a 60-volume ``Collected Works of Lenin.''
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the published works include
10,000 writings, letters and notes, 6,000 more than in the
Chinese-language edition printed in 1959. The rest of the
collection will be published later this year.
   A stamp exhibition honoring Lenin opened Saturday, with a
display of 300 sheets of Soviet stamps provided by the Soviet
Philatelic Union and 168 sheets of Chinese stamps.

   Two children have died in a cholera
outbreak in the Kenyan capital, the government reported Sunday.
   The victims, aged seven months and five years, were among 21
cases of cholera reported this month to authorities in Nairobi,
medical services director Professor J. S. Olieh said.
   Olieh said the disease has struck only in poor suburbs of the
capital, and no foreigners have been affected.
   Cholera is an acute infectious disease caused by bacteria which
are found in fecal-contaminated food or water. The bacteria produce
a toxin that affects the intestines, causing diarrhea, severe fluid
loss, and, if untreated, death.
   Outbreaks have occurred in regions of Africa and Asia with poor
public sanitation.

   Here are excerpts from a Syrian state
television interview with released American hostage Robert Polhill
Sunday night:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q: How do you feel after being released?
   A: I'm very happy and grateful to all the people who spent time
on my case. I'm still deeply concerned about my two friends and
others who are still held in the conditions I was held in.
   Some of them have been held longer than me. My happiness tonight
is a bit toned down that they're not with me. I'm looking forward
that we'll be together again, all of us ...
   I don't know where I'm going. I think it's better you ask me
specific questions. I'm not sure. I can't summarize 39 months of my
life. It's a little bit difficult at this moment. I didn't have
time to begin relecting yet on those 39 months of my life.
   Q: How was your first day in captivity?
   A: I remember my first day in captivity more than the rest of my
days in captivity ... It was boring. We were kept away to ensure
the security of our being kept.
   That prevented us from doing anything. We were not allowed to
speak loudly. We had something to read, but we were deprived
materials that gave any news about us.
   As to our specific conditions, I can tell you it could have been
a lot worse. We were not maltreated, thanks to those who guarded
us, who tried to give us things within the limits of the
restrictions on them. We played cards ...
   We were very much in the dark about our status. We didn't know
where we stood. That was the worst. We didn't know whether we were
going to be released and when or whether we were ever going to be
released.
   In fact, I know that those left behind and others still in
captivity in places I'm not aware of ... quite possibly don't know
that I've been released. But I guess they'll have hope if they know
I've been released.
   Q: What does freedom mean to you?
   A: Freedom is something that, believe it or not, neither me nor
my two associates spent a lot of time thinking about. It's a bit
like you wish you had a T-bone steak in front of you.
   Knowing you were not going to get it right away makes you more
hungry, makes you want that steak more. So we didn't spend time
thinking or talking about when we'd be freed.
   Our most difficult assignment was to find things to think about.
To keep our minds active so we didn't begin to vegetate. I don't
know what psychologists say about this. My belief is that part of
the symptom of a mind beginning to stray and go bad to the point of
danger, is the loss of anger.
   I was angry at what was done to me, at being taken away from my
wife and family, my friends and students. And so I strived to
continue to be angry, knowing at all times that if I began to lose
that anger I would just sort of become a vegetable and I didn't
want that to happen.
   Q: What do you want to say to the world?
   A: One thing I probably should say is that I was a little bit
surprised to find out that the specific demand these men (the
kidnappers) are making and want the world to know seems to be
precisely the same they made about two weeks after our kidnapping,
when Alann Steen made the videotape _ releaseing the 400 prisoners
held in Israeli jails. We seem right back at ground zero.
   One of the last words I heard today from one of them as they
went out was that was still their demand. I don't know if it's
still the same 400 prisoners or others.
   Besides that, I don't think I have any other messages tat I'm
supposed to be carrying to the people or governments of the world
or the United Nations ... As I say this is rather surprising.
   I'd have thought things would have changed over the three years,
that some of those prisoners got released, I don't know.
   Q: What are your plans for the future?
   A: I really don't have any plans for the future yet, except to
see my wife, mother, sons and friends and family. People I haven't
seen in three years, or 39 months, and together talk about things
like that. About the future.

<HEAD>Cameroon Leader to Free Remaining Coup Participants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Paul Biya of Cameroon plans
to free the remaining prisoners jailed for their role in a bloody
1984 coup attempt, Radio Cameroon reported Sunday.
   The state-run radio, citing a government communique issued late
Saturday, said Biya made the decision as a gesture toward national
unity. The communique did not say how many prisoners will be freed.
   The release comes amid a campaign for elections May 17 to choose
delegates to the congress of the ruling Democratic Assembly of
Cameroonese People, the sole legal party.
   Former President Ahmadou Ahidjo turned over power to Biya in
1982 after 22 years in power. Though the transfer came about
peacefully, the two men later had a falling out.
   On April 6, 1984, a faction of the elite Republican Guard loyal
to Ahidjo tried to topple Biya. Bloody fighting raged around
Yaounde, the capital, for two days before the rebels were
suppressed by loyal troops.
   Official estimates put the number of dead at 70, but observers
said as many as 1,000 were killed. At least 46 of the arrested
plotters were later executed.
   Ahidjo, who was living in retirement in France, was tried in
absentia and condemned to death. Biya later lifted the sentence.

<HEAD>Kazem Khalil, Lebanese Christian Legislator, Dead at 89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kazem Khalil, a Lebanese Moslem legislator whose
home had been bombed at the start of Lebanon's civil war, died
early Sunday of a heart attack during a visit to Paris, family
members said. He was 89.
   Khalil had been the oldest Lebanese lawmaker, serving
intermittently in the Parliament since 1937.
   He had been in excellent health and on Saturday presided over a
meeting of Lebanese deputies living in Paris, the family said. He
was found dead by one of his daughters about 4 a.m.
   A Shiite Moslem, Khalil will be buried in accordance with his
will in Damascus, Syria, the family said. A memorial ceremony will
be held in Beirut.
   Khalil had planned to return to Beirut this week to celebrate
the end of the Moslem holy month of Ramadan, the family said.
   He is survived by two sons and three daughters.
   Khalil served as a deputy in parliament for most of the 35 years
from 1937 to 1972, when the last parliamentary elections were held.
He was elected to a four-year term in 1972, but civil war broke out
in 1975 between Christians and Moslems and has prevented new
elections. The legislature regularly renews its mandate.
   Khalil's death reduced parliament's membership to 69. Since war
broke out, 28 members have died, five violently, and two other
seats are vacant.
   Born in 1901 in Tyre to a land-owning family, Khalil was
considered one of the last links to Lebanon's feudal past. He
studied in Beirut as a young man and later earned a law degree from
the University of Damascus.
   Khalil, who saw Lebanon gain independence from France in 1943,
was one of the founders of former President Camille Chamoun's
National Liberal Party and fiercely opposed the presence of armed
Palestinians in Lebanon. That presence led to the 1982 Israeli
invasion.
   One of his homes was dynamited at the beginning of the civil war
and the otherwas seized by Palestinian guerrillas. Khalil has since
lived in a Christian sector of Beirut.
   Khalil and other deputies met last year in Taif, Saudi Arabia,
devising a new power-sharing arrangement between the country's
Christians and Moslems and empowering parliament to select a new
president.
   Khalil oversaw the election of Rene Moawad as president. Moawad
was killed 17 days later in a bomb blast. Khalil then presided over
the election of the current president, Elias Hrawi.
   Christian military leader Gen. Michel Aoun denounces the Taif
accords and Hrawi's presidency, saying they legitimize the
occupation of Lebanon by 40,000 Syrian troops.

   Clashes between Moslem protesters and security
forces resulted in 22 deaths earlier this month near China's far
western border, an official television report disclosed.
   The report Saturday by local television in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region was picked up Sunday by the monitoring service of
the British Broadcasting Corp.
   The clashes came after months of warnings by Chinese officials
of potential trouble in Xinjiang, where tensions between the
majority Han Chinese and Moslem ethnic minorities have escalated
into violence in the past.
   The dead included 15 Kirghiz protesters, an Uygur official and
six policemen, while 19 other police were reported wounded in the
clashes April 5-6 in Baren township, 25 miles south of the ancient
bazaar city of Kashgar.
   Foreign travelers in Xinjiang's capital of Urumqi said at the
time that local residents had told them clashes also occured in
Kashgar and two other towns, and that 50 people were killed. The
television report did not mention unrest anywhere except in Baren.
   Foreigners have been barred from the region, an arid, sparsely
inhabited swath of land near the Soviet border.
   The unofficial reports of the violence began to filter back to
Beijing within days, but officials in Xinjiang and Beijing refused
to comment and the official media was silent until now.
   It was the worst violence in Xinjiang since last May, when
Moslems in Urumqi took to the streets in anger over a Chinese book
they said slandered their customs. Official reports said the
protesters overturned vehicles and engaged in ``smashing and
looting,'' but no deaths were reported.
   The television said the trouble broke out during a festival on
April 5, when a crowd surrounded officials and security forces.
   It said people ``frenziedly stopped and attacked the public
security personnel who went to perform their duty, robbed them of
their weapons and killed six armed police officers and fighters,
injured 13 others and destroyed four police vehicles.''
   The next morning, protesters allegedly opened fire and hurled
bombs at police and officials, wounding three more police. Security
forces gave chase, killing 15 rioters. A Uygur official was killed
and three security officials were injured during the pursuit, the
report said.
   Recent media reports said authorities had shut down unofficial
religious schools and taken action against Moslem imams who
violated laws against proselytizing by stripping them of their
religious qualifications.
   Authorities nationwide have tightened controls on all kinds of
religious worship since suppressing last year's pro-democracy
protests and returning to orthodox hard-line Marxism.

   President Bush, marking Earth Day on a
beach at sunrise, assured environmentalists Sunday they won't be
``too disappointed'' with his upcoming decision on offshore oil
drilling.
   Bush, vacationing at a favorite fishing haunt, also unveiled a
present for the Florida Keys: a proposal to bar big ships and
vessels carrying oil or hazardous materials from the sea lanes
around its fragile coral reef.
   He announced the United States is petitioning the International
Maritime Organization in London to designate the waters within 10
miles of these islads stretching along the Florida coast as an
``area to be avoided'' by the big ships.
   Bush, an avid outdoorsman and angler, went fishing for a second
day, with Curt Gowdy along to film a presidential episode of ``The
American Sportsman.''
   Before flying home to the White House, Bush also made a
telephone call to Nepal to cheer on an international team scaling
Mount Everest on a clean-up mission. He also addressed by telephone
thousands of people at an Earth Day rally in the Columbia River
Gorge in Washington state.
   The climbers included representatives of the United States,
China and Soviet Union. ``Reaching the top of Mount Everest in the
name of peace and understanding reminds all of us on this special
day that there is no task that's too great for the human spirit,''
the president told them.
   He told an Earth Day rally in the Columbia River Gorge that
environmental efforts must be balanced with sound business
practices.
   While saying that much remains to be done to protect the Earth,
Bush said ``We've got to integrate the goal of a strong economy
with that of an improved environment. And we don't have to trade
off a lot of jobs in order to protect and preserve.''
   ``I really am confident that when we celebrate Earth Day's 30th
anniversary, we will have a cleaner, a safer and a healthier
world,'' Bush said.
   The flurry of activities was timed to coincide with the 20th
anniversary of the original Earth Day, which first bred
environmentalism into the national conscience.
   The White House staged a photo opportunity at dawn for Bush and
founders of a Key West group, Reef Relief, which on Friday was
named one of Bush's daily ``points of light'' for its efforts to
protect the coral reefs.
   Its volunteers install buoys that sightseeing and fishing boats
can tie up to instead of dropping anchor and damaging the reef.
   Craig Quirolo, who founded the group with his wife DeeVon, urged
the president in private not to lift a moratorium on drilling in
three environmentally sensitive tracts, two off the California
coast and one here off the Keys and Everglades.
   The moratorium has prevented oil companies that paid $109
million for 73 leases on these tracts in the early 1980s from
drilling exploratory wells.
   Bush has postponed for months his decision on whether to allow
or ban drilling in pristine areas. While defending the safety
record of the oil industry on offshore drilling, he has hinted
before that he may be unwilling to subject the Keys and the
Everglades to the risks of a spill.
   Bush, a former oilman, said Quirolo ``raised with me the very
sensitive question of offshore drilling. ... I told him there would
be an answer very, very soon. And I didn't think he'd be too
disappointed.''
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez and the small crowd of spectators
applauded.
   Outlining the plan to close the sea lanes around the Keys to
ships longer than 50 meters and oil or hazardous material
freighters, Bush said:
   ``The Exxon Valdez disaster has made us all painfully aware of
the ecological devastation which can result from a major oil
spill.''
   He called Florida's multi-hued coral reefs ``one of the most
diverse ecosystems in the world and a unique national treasure.''
   Three ships have run aground and damaged reefs in the past six
months in the sea lanes Bush wants closed.

   Many lawmakers are having second thoughts
about Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev because of his stance on
Lithuania and may block trade agreements that Moscow wants, two
congressional leaders said Sunday.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and House Majority
Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said the United States shouldn't do
any economic favors for Gorbachev as long as he continues to punish
the breakaway Baltic republic.
   President Bush, meanwhile, said Sunday he has not decided how to
respond to the Soviet Union's economic squeeze against Lithuania.
   ``I can't tell you I honestly have made that determination,
no,'' Bush said during a brief meeting with reporters in
Islamorada, Fla.
   Before flying back to Washington on Sunday from a fishing
vacation, Bush also said he did not know when he would meet with
leaders of Congress on Lithuania, as the White House said last week
he would.
   ``I don't have any plans for a meeting tomorrow,'' Bush said.
``It might be (on Monday) but I don't think that's scheduled.''
   Bush has a regularly scheduled meeting with lawmakers set for
Tuesday, but White House officials have said that is not
necessarily the session where he will take up Lithuania.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said that any U.S.
action probably would be focused in the commercial field, such as
suspending negotiations for a trade agreement with Moscow.
   Dole said there is disillusionment with Gorbachev, who has
espoused the Soviet policies of perestroika and glasnost, because
of his tactics on Lithuania.
   Moscow reportedly has shut off oil and gas supplies and
intercepted food to Lithuania in an attempt to force Lithuanian
officials to rescind a declaration of independence.
   ``I think right now a lot of us have put him on hold ... now he
is backtracking on Lithuania,'' Dole said. ``And a lot of us are
having second thoughts.''
   Bush has been treading cautiously on the Lithuania issue, but he
has indicated he may try to make Gorbachev pay an economic price
for cracking down on Lithuania.
   Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's spokesman, has said the president will
announce what he plans to do about Lithuania this week after
meeting with members of Congress.
   Both Dole and Foley, appearing on ABC-TV's ``This Week With
David Brinkley,'' said strains over Lithuania shouldn't derail the
U.S.-Soviet arms control summit set for next month.
   ``The summit ought to continue at this point,'' Foley said.
Added Dole: ``If it's in our interest, let's proceed.''
   The congressional leaders said, however, Congress might stop
trade agreements that Gorbachev wants to help pump up his country's
sagging economy.
   ``Anything that benefits the Soviet Union, we ought to slow-walk
it,'' Dole said.
   Foley agreed, adding the Bush administration should try to
encourage negotiations between Moscow, which wants to see its
nation kept intact, and Lithuania, which wants self-determination.
   Both men said it would be virtually impossible for the United
States to provide direct aid to Lithuania. Any shipments of oil
would be stopped by the Soviet navy in the Baltic Sea, and an
airlift would be difficult to carry out.

   Millions of Americans cleaned up beaches and roadsides, planted
trees and listened to music with a message as they celebrated the
20th anniversary of Earth Day, the ``environmental teach-in'' that
launched a movement.
   In all, some 3,600 American cities and towns mustered forces to
rejuvenate the environmental movement that was launched by the
original Earth Day in 1970.
   ``I get a real sense of a renewal, and a kind of rededication,
that will provide the support for change at the grass-roots
level,'' said John McLachlan, scientific director at the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle
Park, N.C. ``There's a sense of urgency that hasn't been there.''
   Thousands watched a hot-air balloon _ decorated as the Earth _
rise in New York's Times Square where the ball falls on New Year's
Eve. The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled a fleet of cars
and trucks powered by alcohol, natural gas and electricity in Ann
Arbor, Mich.
   Students at Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania buried a
paper mache ``Old Earth'' containing a plastic foam cup, aerosol
can, disposable diaper and container of leaded gasoline.
   At a gathering of 125,000 people at the U.S. Capitol in
Washington, several activists criticized President Bush for
spending the weekend fishing in Florida.
   One was Peter Bahouth, president of Greenpeace USA, who brought
with him a life-size cardboard cutout of Bush.
   Gaylord Nelson of The Wilderness Society, who originated the
first Earth Day when he was a senator from Wisconsin, called for a
grassroots campaign to keep the spirit of Sunday's celebrations
alive in the years to come.
   ``I don't want to come back here 20 years from now and have to
tell your sons and daughters that you didn't do your duty,''
Nelson, 74, told his listeners. ``We've to to raise a conservation
generation.''
   Pennsylvania's Gov. Robert P. Casey led an ``All Species
Parade'' in Philadelphia, playing the pied piper to children
dressed in animal costumes made from recycled materials, and at
least one marcher got the point.
   We must recycle, said eleven-year-old Lauren Derby of
Philadelphia, ``so that the future generation can have a nice Earth
and a nice environment.''
   Hall and Oates, the B-52s, the Saturday Night Live Band and Edie
Brickell and the New Bohemians were among the performers in New
York's Central Park, where an estimated 300,000 people turned out.
   On an expressway near the Charles River in Boston, artists used
biodegradable chalk to draw a half-mile-long, multi-colored tableau
of birds, butterflies, flowers and messages like ``Recycle!'' and
``Save The Earth.''
   Unlike the first Earth Day, this year's commemoration was an
international event. More than 140 countries on all seven
continents participated, according to Earth Day 1990 of Palo Alto,
Calif.
   The international celebration will ``give the clear message to
politicians that millions of people are aware of the problems
facing the earth,'' said Andrew Lees of the British branch of
Friends of the Earth.
   President Bush took a break from his fishing trip in the Florida
Keys to give what he calls a ``point of light'' award to the
citizens group Reef Relief, which is working to save the coral reef
flanking the Keys.
   Bush also said he would back a resolution to keep merchant ships
off the reef. When Craig Quirolo, one of the founders of Reef
Relief, asked for a ban on oil drilling in the Keys, Bush said the
answer would come soon and that Quirolo wouldn't be disappointed.
Nine oil companies hold 73 leases off of the Keys.
   In Boston, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles performed for Earth
Day. They ``serve as reminders of how we must care for our
environment,'' the show's organizers said. The story goes that it
was a toxic chemical that transformed them from ordinary terrapins
into Hollywood's box-office champs.
   The Nature Conservancy marked Earth Day with the signing of
land-protection deals in all 50 states that will protect a total of
71,000 acres of natural terrain. The aim is to help save rare
plants and animals from extinction, the organization said.
   The day dawned on a somber note in Oak Ridge, Tenn., where
demonstrators in white death masks and black shrouds held a
``requiem for the Earth'' at the gates of a nuclear weapons plant.
   ``We gather this day on soil once filled with the richness of
life, pure and vital,'' said the Rev. Ralph Hutchison of Dandridge,
Tenn. ``But the life of this soil is now measured with Geiger
counters.''
   The demonstration concluded with Ney Pierno, an Amazonian Indian
from Peru, planting an 8-foot black oak as a symbol of life.
   ``I want to thank you, the whole world, about Earth Day,''
Pierno said. ``From now on, today, tomorrow and forever, we'll have
Earth Day.''

<TEXT>
   The government said Sunday it put up $1.8
million to help establish a Jewish settlement in the Old City's
Christian quarter that has raised a storm of protest from
Palestinians.
   While the Housing Ministry's statement said it acted completely
legally, left-wing legislator Yossi Sarid said he wanted the state
prosecutor to investigate whether laws were broken.
   ``This just shows that the government acted provocatively,
proving how dangerous it is for the country,'' Sarid said in a
telephone interview.
   The government statement is the first confirmation of official
involvement in buying up Arab property in the walled Old City
captured by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war.
   The settlement of 150 Jews in the complex not far from the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre on April 11 has set off angry
demonstrations by Christian clerics and Palestinians, both
Christian and Moslem.
   It also has brought a series of legal moves by the Greek
Orthodox Church, which owns the building and wants the Jews evicted.
   The $1.8 million passed from the Housing Ministry to a
subsidiary trusteeship of the Jewish National Fund, the ministry's
statement said. The fund, part of the quasi-governmental Jewish
Agency, was created in 1901 to acquire land for the founding of
Israel.
   The money then went to a Panamanian company, SBC, that bought
leasing rights to four 100-year-old buildings owned by the Greek
Orthodox Church and then rented the space to a religious Jewish
group, which created the settlement.
   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Eti Eshed said Sunday that in early
April a Cabinet committee allotted $4 million for redeeming
property in Arab east Jerusalem, which includes the Old City.
   She said this money also was turned over to the Jewish National
Fund subsidiary.
   The settlement, called Neot David, is the only Jewish presence
in the Old City's Christian sector. Its spokesmen have consistently
said no government money was involved in the settlement.
   Removal of the the settlers has been blocked by appeals. The
Supreme Court has ruled that they can stay at least until the next
court hearing Thursday.
   Jerusalem's Old City is divided into separate districts for
Moslems, Jews and Christians, and many Palestinian Christians saw
the settlement as a threat to their place in the Holy City.
   The Old City is on land captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East war. Israel has annexed the area, but most foreign nations,
including the United States, do not recognize Israel's sovereignty.
   The United States has repeatedly said it considers Jewish
settlements on occupied land to be an obstacle to peace.
   The Hebrew daily Maariv reported Sunday that caretaker Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir ordered the Housing Ministry to buy real
estate in the Old City in 1983, but the purchases were blocked by
the Labor Party.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Shamir, was asked about the report
and replied: ``We know nothing about this.''
   In a related development Sunday, Egypt criticized Israel on new
settlements in occupied Arab territories.
   ``These procedures, which have been approved by Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, reveal the measures ... that without doubt
threaten to complicate any effort to a peaceful settelement,'' the
Egyptian Foreign Ministry said in a release.

<HEAD>Shiite Leader Key Figure in Hostage Release</HEAD>
<HEAD>Wth AM-Hostages-Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hussein Musawi, the Lebanese Shiite
leader who was an influential figure in negotiating the release of
hostage Robert Polhill, was once an advocate of kidnapping
foreigners and launching terrorist attacks against the West.
   But in recent years, the 45-year-old leader of the militant
Islamic Amal faction in Syrian-controlled east Lebanon has moved
away from the influence of Iran's hard-liners and into Syria's more
moderate orbit.
   Musawi is the only Lebanese Shiite leader who publicly admits he
coordinates with the hostages' captors and has influence over them.
   His Islamic Amal, part of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia,
advocates strong links with Syria.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella organization for Shiite
Moslem splinter groups holding most of the 18 Western hostages in
Lebanon.
   Musawi's success in influencing the release of Polhill
highlights new efforts by Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani,
leader of Tehran's so-called pragmatists, and Syrian President
Hafez Assad, Iran's main Arab ally, to end the long-running hostage
drama and advance relations with the West.
   But Musawi's exact role in the release is not known and the
question remains whether his influence will extend beyond the
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, which released
Polhill, to other Shiite factions that hold hostages.
   Syria hopes that mediating the release of U.S. hostages will
persuade the United States to improve relations and take it off the
list of countries sponsoring terrorism.
   But anti-Western Iranian radicals, and their militant Shiite
allies in Lebanon, have oppose releasing any of the hostages.
   Iran's move to improve relations with the West and release
hostages began in earnest in June after the death of the Islamic
nation's revolutionary spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   But the breakthrough appears to have come in August, when Musawi
was deposed from the leadership of Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   A well-informed Shiite source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Musawi was dropped from Hezbollah's 12-man Majlis
al-Shura, or Council of Advice, for what it called ``dual loyalty.''
   ``They considered he was more loyal to Syria than to Iran,'' the
source said.
   Musawi denies that he was dismissed from the council and
Hezbollah has refused to comment.
   Musawi has strong influence over groups holding some of the
hostages. He told an Aug. 6 news conference that some members of
pro-Iranian organizations holding most of the 18 Western hostages
at that time are ``known to us and we hold consultations with them
from time to time.
   ``If I said that we did not know anyone from these groups or
there was no contact between us, you should not believe it,'' he
said.
   The hostage-holders, Musawi declared, ``may listen to
us...because our voice is closer to them and we're living together.
   ``After all, we live in Lebanon, we live in the southern suburbs
of Beirut, we live in Baalbek and the south ... We know who does
what,'' he added.
   Musawi's influence with the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine could indicate they may free the two other American
hostages they hold, Alann Steen and Jesse Turner.
   Musawi founded Islamic Amal in 1982 after he was dismissed from
the mainstream Shiite Amal movement for appearing more loyal to
Iran then to Syria.
   He returned to his home village of Nabi Sheet in the
Syrian-controled Bekaa Valley and founded Islamic Amal, which he
aligned with Hezbollah.
   Musawi, one source said, ``is not a fanatical Shiite. He's
ambitious and smart. He wanted to enjoy Syria's backing for his
movement on the ground and the spiritual Shiite attachment to
Khomeini and he succeeded in doing that for quite a while.''
   From 1982 until last summer, Musawi was an virulent supporter of
almost all terrorist operations carried out by pro-Iranian factions.
   But when a power struggle developed in Iran between Rafsanjani
and anti-Western radicals led by former interior minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, ``Musawi favored the Syrian line and the hard-liners
dropped him from Hezbollah's command,'' the Shiite source said.
   It was then that Musawi started working for the release of
foreign captives, the source noted.

   Strong thunderstorms spread rain across the Deep South on
Sunday, and showers fell on the northern Plains and along the
northwest Pacific coastline.
   Southerly winds pushed temperatures into the 70s and 80s in the
north-central Plains. Temperatures were expected to remain
unseasonably warm in the region for the beginning of the week.
   In the Northeast and Northwest, temperatures were in the 50s and
60s on Sunday, the National Weather Service said.
   Heavy rainfall in the six-hour period ending at 2 p.m. EDT of
almost 2 inches was reported at Pine Bluff, Ark.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from southeastern Arkansas to
northwest Florida on Sunday. A thunderstorm in southern Alabama
produced hail an inch in diameter at Pritchard.
   A severe thunderstorm watch was in effect for portions of the
lower Mississippi Valley in the early afternoon, and for later in
the afternoon over the Gulf coastline from Mississippi to
northwestern Florida.
   In the northern Plains, a rain and thunderstorms were scattered
over the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota.
   Showers forming in advance of a cold front dampened the northern

<TEXT>
   The killing of the seventh cabbie in just over
six weeks prompted Mayor David Dinkins on Sunday to order
stepped-up police action _ including undercover officers as drivers.
   Dinkins called the killings ``a public crisis'' and ``a threat
to the entire city.''
   Police say believe one killer was responsible for the killings
of three cab drivers earlier in the Bronx, presumably during
robbery attempts.
   They were trying to determine if killings Sunday in the Bronx
and Saturday in Brooklyn were related. Investigators have said they
are unsure if two other earlier killings are related.
   All but one of the drivers killed worked for car services, which
generally dispatch cabs to pick up customers who telephone. That is
distinct from the so-called yellow or medallion cabs which make up
the bulk of the city's fleet and which cruise the streets looking
for passengers.
   The mayor noted the importance of car services in outer, often
poor neighborhoods largely abandoned by cruising yellow cabs for
fear of crime and for lack of paying passengers for the return trip
to Manhattan.
   ``These killings represent more than a brutal attack on the
drivers who have fallen victim,'' Dinkins said. ``They have also
become an assault on a vital link in our transportation system.''
   Car service companies report they have lost anywhere from a
quarter to half of their night drivers since the killings began
March 7, said Tony Carter, a spokesman for the city Taxi and
Limousine Commission.
   ``They haven't been quitting,'' he said. ``They just haven't
been showing up for work for fear for their lives.''
   The body of the latest victim, whose name was withheld, was
found Sunday morning in his car in the Bronx. He had been shot in
the head.
   The driver shot Saturday in Brooklyn was identified as Ferdinand
Jeannot, 27.
   The bullet that killed him was fired from the back seat and went
through a plastic partition, police said. They speculated the
gunman may have intended to rob Jeannot, but couldn't reach his
wallet, containing $100, because of the partition and because the
two front doors were locked.
   The three connected shootings involved car service drivers, all
called to pick up a passenger late at night in the same general
area.
   Ballistics tests have shown the bullets were from the same
.22-caliber gun. Robbery was the presumed motive.
   Investigators had yet to determine whether one or both of the
weekend shootings were connected to the earlier ones.
   ``Certainly there's some similarities,'' said police Lt. Donald
F. Stephenson.
   The mayor ordered Police Commissioner Lee Brown to expand a
30-member task force assigned to finding the killer or killers.
   Mitch Kossoff, a dispatcher for Rite-Way II dial-a-ride service
in the Bronx, said the practice of picking up fares on the street
has ground to a halt.
   Most of the employees are ``very shaky, especially the night
drivers,'' he said. ``I can tell by the way guys are talking
they're not even looking for street work.''
   Many of the drivers believe the spree is the work of copycat
killers, he said. ``I just think it's a bunch of crazy guys out
there.''
   Nine car service drivers have been killed this year. Last year
32 drivers of various kinds of cabs were killed on the job,
according to police and the taxi commission.

   High school senior David Campbell is a
so-so student with a C average, but he helped pull Texas to a
first-place finish in the 1990 Academic Decathlon Sunday.
   ``I don't really think that grades measure intelligence,''
Campbell said. ``I struggle with laziness myself, but this has
given me the opportunity to prove myself.''
   The gold medal in the best overall student category hung around
Campbell's neck as his teammates surrounded him.
   The team from Lake Highlands High School in Dallas clinched
first place with 46,627 points and won a trip to the White House.
They'll be received by President Bush in the Oval Office on
Thursday.
   Laguna Hills High School in Laguna Hills, Calif., finished a
close second with 46,035 points. Third was Mountain View school
from Mesa, Ariz., with 45,949.
   Nine-member teams from 39 high schools nationwide have put in
extra hours after school and reserved Saturday afternoons to
prepare for the annual contest, which began in 1968 in Orange
County, California. It became a national event in 1982.
   Teams were grilled for two days on a variety of subjects,
ranging from the fine arts to mathematics. The competition ended
this year with a Super Quiz on American Indians.
   Each student was graded on a seven-minute interview, a one-hour
essay and an impromptu speech. They were tested in economics, fine
arts, language, literature, mathematics, science and social science.
   The competition isn't just for the best and the brightest. It's
a real team effort, with students with A, B and C averages
competing against each other in separate categories and
contributing to the overall team score.
   ``I love being with my team,'' said Campbell. ``Our whole team
is real consistent. It's a team thing.''
   Preparing the students for the competition was like a marathon
which paid off, said Texas coach Carole Buchanan. It was the first
time Lake Highlands had won the Texas contest and earned a spot in
the national competition.
   ``We worked hard and we knew we had a chance to win. But we all
knew it was going to be very close with California,'' she said.
   Laguna High School in California finished a close second with
46,035 points.
   ``We didn't know until the last moment when they announced
California was second. Then we could believe it,'' Buchanan said.
   Laguna coach Kathy Lane didn't hide her disappointment at the
second-place finish. Texas and California have been close rivals in
the competition, with each state winning the national competition
four times before. Ms. Lane vowed to be back again next year to win
the gold.
   ``We have the spirit. We're going to use it to plan strategy for
next year,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of the editorial in
Monday's edition of the English-language Tehran Times daily on the
hostage issue. The Iranian newspaper often reflects the views of
Iran's president, Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The release of the first Western hostage in Beirut is now a
reality. This necessitates that those involved should now even
enhance their well-intentioned common moves and cooperation and
expedite their efforts to ensure the continuation of the release
process for all the hostages.
   Undoubtedly and for a fact the settlement of the hostage issue
in Lebanon and occupied Palestine is beyond any single country. It
requires an all-out effort on the part of all the concerned parties.
   The Islamic republic, in using its spiritual clout along this
line, virtually left no stone unturned.
   The Iranians' painstaking and continuous efforts in this
connection over the recent months have actually proven that the
whole thing is a highly complicated matter.
   One just cannot hope to achieve anything without paying due
attention to the rightful demands of the Lebanese groups involved.
   The Tehran Times believes that to contribute to the
establishment of a general atmosphere of trust, the Lebanese groups
should release another American hostage.
   By doing so, they once more prove their goodwill and
preparedness for the settlement of the issue.
   The Lebanese groups will certainly find it hard to comply with
this request and their position is quite understandable.
   But perhaps the release of one hostage alone will not be enough
to establish the kind of overwhelming trust needed to bring the
whole hostage crisis to an end.
   But for both the Lebanese groups and the Islamic republic
officials, it is Islamic and humane considerations that count most.
   Goodwill should not come from one side only. It is a two-way
street.
   The Tehran Times, however, from the very beginning has believed
in the unconditional freedom of all hostages on Islamic and
humanitarian grounds only.
   This daily believes that the release process must be expedited
by acts of goodwill by the concerned party on the other side.
   To negotiate with Lebanese groups, which have been subject to
all kinds of hardship under Israeli aggression and while scores of
their brothers are held in captivity in Lebanon and occupied
Palestine is certainly not an easy task.
   Their trampled rights should never be eclipsed by anything. Even
the Islamic republic will not succeed in its efforts to get the
hostages released if it fails to consider the rightful demands of
these oppressed groups.
   But if the other party too displays its goodwill, Iranian
efforts can be facilitated to ensure the release of all hostages in
1990.
   We do believe that the Lebanese groups should still free a
second American hostage with no pre-conditions. This they should do
swiftly in order to leave the ball in the other party's court to
demonstrate its goodwill, if it has any.
   In fact, the Iranian people and government have no faith in the
U.S. administration. But perhaps it is now time to test President
Bush's claims that ``goodwill begets goodwill.''

<HEAD>Marrow Brings Mahalia Jackson to Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs Planned</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The strength of ``Truly Blessed'' is its tone _
of sincerity, simplicity and dignity _ plus the joyful noise of its
music.
   ``Truly Blessed,'' which opened at Broadway's Longacre Theater
on Sunday afternoon, is the story of the great gospel singer
Mahalia Jackson performed by Queen Esther Marrow, also a respected
gospel singer. Miss Marrow had the idea for ``Truly Blessed'' and
wrote some of the songs that compellingly tell the story.
   There also are traditional spirituals: ``St. Louis Blues,''
which Miss Jackson _ known as ``Haley'' _ listened to as a girl,
and ``He's Got the Whole World in His Hand,'' a song identified
with Miss Jackson in her last years.
   Four singers provide a chorus. All of them can be occasionally
shrill but Miss Marrow never is. Her voice, in a lower register
like Miss Jackson's, is a straightforward power and doesn't need
excitement-seeking high flourishes.
   One difference: Miss Jackson bent her notes in a bluesy way more
than Miss Marrow does. Miss Marrow obviously decided not to imitate.
   A combo of musicians is at one side of the stage. A platform
with two sets of steps fills the rest of the space, backed by what
looks like big organ pipes. Miss Marrow wears a succession of choir
robes, housedress, blue wedding dress, suits and gowns. She talks
between songs.
   Mahalia Jackson wouldn't sing in nightclubs. Early in ``Truly
Blessed,'' Miss Marrow, always in character, says that she could
have sung the blues but she liked singing gospel because they were
songs of hope, that God could cure what was wrong. ``You get done
with the blues, you got nothing to rest on.''
   Miss Jackson joined the Greater Salem Baptist Church choir after
she moved to Chicago with an aunt. She and the quartet push chairs
together to depict ``the lean years'' _ car travel with the Johnson
Gospel Singers, one of the first professional touring gospel
groups. They discuss a preacher who thought Miss Jackson's ``joyful
noise'' was too jazzy and the discomforts of not being able to stop
the car in the South.
   Brief scenes show Miss Jackson singing at a Mayor Richard Daley
rally in Chicago, marrying Sigmond Galloway and everybody dancing
at a restaurant afterwards, praying before singing at Carnegie
Hall, marching with Martin Luther King, and readying to sing in
Europe and visit the Holy Land.
   A longer scene in which Miss Jackson is asked dumb, esoteric
questions at a convention of musicologists is contrived but funny.
   Robert Kalfin directs. Producers are Howard Hurst, Philip Rose
and Sophie Hurst in association with Frankie Hewitt. ``Truly
Blessed'' was first produced at Ford's Theater in Washington.
   House lights go on twice, to show people clapping along. But the
show isn't a rave-up. It's lively but respectful of the artist who
first impressed many in the world of the value of gospel music.

<HEAD>Condor Missile Project Halted</HEAD>

   The defense minister said
Argentina has halted development of a medium-range missile that
arms control experts said could carry a chemical or nuclear
warhead, newspapers reported Sunday.
   ``The Condor 2 project is paralyzed. It is not going ahead
because of a political decision and the lack of funds,'' the
defense minister, Humberto Romero, said in remarks reported in
several newspapers Sunday. ``The project is frozen.''
   Development of the missile began in the 1980s and diplomatic
sources have said Iraq provided financing and Egypt lent
techological expertise.
   The Condor 2 missile, which Argentina has stressed would only be
used to launch satellites, is reportedly powerful enough to carry a
3,300-pound warhead 625 miles. Arms experts have repeatedly stated
that the missile could carry a nuclear or chemical warhead.
   In his remarks Romero said the development of the missile ``in
no way signified a risk or danger to anyone.''
   In September, President Carlos Menem reportedly told President
Bush that Argentina was considering ending the Condor project.
   In May, Assistant Secretary of State Allen Holmes told a Senate
Armed Services subcommittee that the development of the Condor 2
was years behind schedule ``and we believe this can be traced to
problems in acquiring technology.''
   He said nations that are signatories to the Missile Technology
Control Regime had been denying Argentina the technology necessary
for the rocket's development.
   The missile treaty was established to limit the spread of
rockets to the Third World and has been signed by nations including
the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and
Canada.
   Egypt apparently dropped out of the Condor project several
months ago, partially due to pressure from the United States.
   Iraq's missile program has been rapidly advancing. In December,
Iraq's Minister of Industry and Military Industrialization, Hussein
Kamel, announced that Baghdad had launched a three-stage rocket
capable of launching satellites.
   Iraqi officials also claimed Iraq had test-fired two
surface-to-surface missiles with ranges of 1,240 miles.

   About 600 protesters demanding the
resignation of interim President Ion Iliescu blocked University
Square on Sunday, capping a day of demonstrations in Romania that
attracted tens of thousands.
   The protesters barricaded themselves behind wooden advertising
panels in front of the Intercontinental Hotel and chanted: ``Down
with Communism! This government is definitely Communist!''
   Several hundred police, including 120 riot troops equipped with
nightsticks and plastic shields, ringed the demonstrators but did
not intervene.
   The protesters, demonstrating in front of the Intercontinental
Hotel, were part of a rally of 5,000 that earlier Sunday marched to
Romanian television requesting that it become independent from
government control.
   The frequency of rallies has increased recently as elections
draw near. The May 20 balloting will be Romania's first free
elections in more than 50 years. At least 70 political parties are
entered.
   The University Square protesters wrote slogans in white chalk on
the pavement: ``Down with FSN!'' and ``FSN has confiscated the
revolution!''
   FSN is the National Salvation Front, the party that took power
immediately after the December revolution that ousted Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were
found guilty of ``grave crimes'' and executed Dec. 25.
   The Front, whose leading members are former Communists who
declared they broke from the party after the revolution, is accused
by the opposition parties of promoting a milder version of Marxism.
   ``Our unity here is a guarantee to save Romania from the biggest
danger, which is represented by the Front,'' said Nicolae Popescu,
a student who belongs to the Partyless Movement, the organizer of
the rally.
   Iliescu, 60, a former Communist Party secretary, ran afoul of
Ceausescu and was demoted to lesser jobs. He is the Front's
candidate for president.
   The Front, which claims some 800,000 members, is widely seen as
the most organized of the parties, drawing support mainly from
industrial workers and former Communist Party members.

   The admission by gubernatorial candidate
Clayton Williams that he patronized prostitutes as a young man
raises new questions about his attitudes toward women, his
opponent's campaign said Sunday.
   ``In recent months, the Republican nominee has made several
comments which, taken together, drive this wedge between men and
women, and I think that's unfortunate,'' said Glenn Smith, manager
of state Treasurer Ann Richards' campaign for governor.
   Smith said Ms. Richards, the Democratic candidate, was
vacationing and would not comment on Williams' admissions, which
appeared Sunday in The Houston Post.
   ``I've never claimed to be a perfect man,'' Williams told the
newspaper in discussing his use of prostitutes. ``It's part of
growing up in West Texas. ...
   ``It's like the Larry McMurtry book, `The Last Picture Show,'''
said the Fort Stockton native, a 58-year-old political neophyte who
won the GOP nomination last month after spending millions of
dollars of his own money.
   Williams was in Arizona on Sunday and unavailable to answer
questions.
   His press secretary, Bill Kenyon, released the following
statement:
   ``One of Clayton's greatest strengths as a person is one of his
greatest `weaknesses' as a politician; he always tries to be
honest. ... ``When Clayton was tracked down by a reporter chasing
outlandish rumors about Clayton's past that have been fanned by the
Richards campaign and other Democrats, he dismissed them as absurd.
   ``Most politicians would have stopped there,'' the statement
continued. ``But when the reporter went further and asked if he had
ever visited a prostitute, Clayton surprised some folks by
conceding once again that he's not perfect and by telling the truth
about incidents earlier in his life, even when it wasn't
politically expedient.''
   Last month, Williams stirred criticism from women's groups by
making a joking about rape. He later apologized.
   Williams, interviewed during an independent oil group meeting in
Scottsdale, Ariz., told the Post he paid prostitutes a number of
times in Texas and Mexico. He said it had been at least 35 years
since he did so.
   ``As a teen-ager, it's part of growing up in West Texas. You go
to Mexico. It's part of the fun,'' he said.
   Williams added that he patronized prostitutes while a student at
Texas A&amp;M University, adding that ``it was kind of what the boys
did at A&amp;M,'' he said. ``It was a lot different in those days. The
houses were the only place you got serviced then.''
   Prostitution is illegal in Texas and was illegal 35 years ago;
it is legal in parts of Mexico.
   In a telephone interview from Houston, Smith said Williams'
``private behavior is best left to him and his family'' and not a
legitimate subject for a campaign.
   But he also said Williams' comments about women should be a
topic of debate. ``He implies that women are here to `service' men.
That kind of an attitude is as insulting to men as it is to
women,'' Smith said.
   Ms. Richards won the Democratic nomination on April 10 after a
mudslinging runoff campaign in which her opponent, Attorney General
Jim Mattox, accused her of using illegal drugs as recently as 10
years ago but offered no evidence.
   Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, declined to answer
questions about illegal drug use, saying her addiction had been
alcohol and that public discussions might discourage others from
seeking treatment.
   During a cattle roundup on his ranch last month, Williams
likened bad weather to rape and said that if it was inevitable,
``just relax and enjoy it.'' The next day, he said he was sorry and
said he realized his comment was insensitive.
   However, during a visit to Washington before the Democratic
runoff, Williams told reporters he would feel uncomfortable running
against a woman.
   The millionaire businessman-rancher won the GOP nomination with
61 percent of the vote in a seven-man race March 13 after spending
more than $8 million on the race, including $6 million of his own
funds.
   In his interview with the Post, Williams said the final decision
belongs to voters but that he doesn't believe that a candidate's
private life as a youth should have any bearing on his ability to
lead.
   ``If doing drugs 10 years ago is all right, then certainly I
think going to a Mexican border town 40 years ago is all right,''
Williams said, alluding to allegations against Ms. Richards.

   Turkish-dominated northern Cyprus
overwhelmingly re-elected Rauf Denktash to a fourth term as
president Sunday.
   With 80 percent of the ballots counted, Denktash had 52,915
votes or 67 percent, the election board announced.
   Denktash, 66, ran on an independent ticket for a five-year term.
His chief rival, Ismail Bozkurt, also an independent, captured 31.7
percent. Alpay Durduran of the New Cyprus Party had 1.3 percent.
   No violence was reported. Polls were open between 8 a.m. and 6
p.m. Complete returns were expected Monday.
   Claiming victory, Denktash called on Greek Cypriots to accept
the Turkish Cypriots' right to self-determination.
   ``We invite them to friendship,'' he said.
   Cyrpus, whose population is 78 percent Greek and 19 percent
Turkish, achieved independence from Britain in 1960. Internal
strife between Turks and Greeks led to an invasion by Turkey in
July 1974, after Athens-led coup seized the government.
   A cease-fire collapsed and by August 1974, Turkish forces
occupied 40 percent of the island in the north.
   Turkish Cypriots voted in 1975 to form a separate state and
declared full independence in November 1983, changing the name to
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus from the previous Turkish
federated state of Cyprus.
   Denktash was elected president of the Turkish federated state in
1976, 1981 and 1985.
   Turkey is the only country which recognizes the breakaway state.
   Sunday's election came two weeks before legislative elections.
That ballotting may determine the outcome of stalled peace talks
aimed at reuniting the island.

   A senior Communist official from Moscow
said Sunday the Lithuanian independence movement is leading the
republic to catastrophe, and denied the Kremlin has imposed a total
economic blockade.
   The Sajudis independence movement, whose leaders dominate
Lithuania's government, declared its determination to stand by the
March 11 declaration of independence.
   In neighboring Latvia, meanwhile, the drive for independence
received a show of support in a rally attended by 8,086 of the
16,000 newly elected members of city councils, regional bodies and
the republic's parliament, a journalist reported. Only 307 people
attended a nearby meeting of a group opposing Latvian independence.
   In Tokyo, Soviet reformer Yuri Afanasyev condemned his nation's
economic sanctions against Lithuania.
   ``Leaders just want to maintain imperialism,'' said Afanasyev, a
legislator who recently split with the Communist Party.
   But in Vilnius, Andrei N. Girenko, a secretary of the Soviet
Communist Party Central Committee, defended the Soviet move and
said that Lithuania's declaration of independence meant a loss of
preferred prices and favorable trade conditions.
   ``This would sharply, catastrophically affect the republic's
affairs and the living standards of its people,'' he said.
   Girenko denied Moscow had imposed a total economic boycott,
saying that only oil and natural gas were affected.
   ``This is only a small part of the products that are supplied,''
he said. ``Plans for a total blockade don't exist.''
   The streets of Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, were calm
Sunday, with people walking rather than using cars as they coped
with stringent gasoline rationing that permits about 7 gallons per
month for private cars.
   Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all trying to restore the
independence they lost in 1940 when they were occupied and forcibly
annexed to the Soviet Union. Lithuania has declared independence,
Estonia has dropped enforcement of the Soviet Constitution, and
Latvia is expected to declare its freedom from the Soviet Union on
May 3.
   Lithuanian Deputy Premier Romualdas Ozolas charged Saturday that
the Kremlin was implementing a full economic embargo, halting all
rail and truck traffic to the tiny republic.
   Lithuanian officials also said numerous shipments of food,
metals, wood, chemicals and parts had not arrived as scheduled, and
payments to Lithuanian businesses have been halted.
   Ozolas told reporters that Lithuanian ports have already stopped
loading goods for exports.
   On Sunday, the Lithuanian government sent a telegram to Soviet
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov saying that the Soviet cut-off of fuel
and raw materials would choke Lithuanian processing and
manufacturing of goods meant for export and the Soviet market.
   The republic depends entirely on Soviet resources at subsidized
prices.
   The Soviet decision to cut off all of Lithuania's oil supply and
nearly all of its natural gas is expected to put 70 percent of the
republic's work force out of work.
   The Sajudis independence movement also was meeting Sunday. It
accused the Kremlin of attempting to use economic means to turn
Lithuanians against the drive for independence.
   ``The Soviet Union seeks to deal a blow to the daily existence
of every person, hoping that we shall be overpowered by our
material interests,'' the declaration said.
   Lithuania, the declaration said ``can only be saved through our
spiritual fortitude, unity and resolve.''
   Also Sunday, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis appeared
on television and denied reports that the declaration of
independence would be frozen for two years in hopes of reaching a
compromise with Moscow.
   In Latvia, the 9,000 elected officials meeting in Riga's Daugava
Stadium adopted an appeal for the parliament to consider restoring
the independence of Latvia ``without delay in its first session,''
journalist Boris Kolesnikov reported.
   ``The historical experience of the last 50 years convinces us
that only a free and independent nation can guarantee the continued
existence and development of the Latvian nation, as well as the
safety and welfare of all the inhabitants of Latvia,'' the
declaration said.
   In Moscow, about 5,000 people gathered at a pro-democracy rally
and shouted, ``Freedom for Lithuania!''
   ``Shame on the organizers of the economic blockade of
Lithuania!'' read one poster at the demonstration.

   President Bush welcomed the release of
an American hostage Sunday, but declared that ``I don't have
forgiveness in my heart as long as one American is held against his
will.''
   Bush emphasized that the release of Robert Polhill was not
enough to warrant a goodwill gesture from him _ other than words of
thanks _ toward the kidnappers or the countries they follow.
   ``I'm not trying to think up any gesture,'' Bush said in
response to a question. ``I want all of those hostages out. We're
not going to trade.''
   Bush learned of Polhill's release while on a daylong fishing
expedition in the Florida Keys. He was kept updated by
ship-to-shore communications with the White House situation room.
   As Polhill relished his first day of freedom in 39 months, seven
other Americans remained in the captivity of terrorists in Lebanon.
   ``I can't talk forgiveness,'' Bush said. ``I don't have
forgiveness in my heart as long as one American is held against his
will and as long as one family has a broken heart.''
   He said he talked by telephone with Polhill, his wife and his
mother, and that they all noted that other Americans are still
hostage.
   ``This is a mission uncompleted,'' Bush said.
   Polhill was to be flown to a U.S. military medical facility in
Wiesbaden, West Germany for a physical examination. A State
Department ``hostage recovery'' team was dispatched to aid
Polhill's return to freedom and U.S. officials offered
transportation to West Germany for Polhill's family.
   In a written statement, Bush expressed thanks to Iran and Syria
for efforts leading to Polhill's freedom. Iran, particularly, has
been a U.S. adversary for more than a decade, and Syria has been
denounced as a sponsor of terrorism.
   However, Bush omitted Iran from his words of appreciation in a
later face-to-face meeting with reporters.
   ``I have goodwill toward Syria for playing an active role in
this release,'' he said.
   As for Iran, he said, he was ``stopping a little short.''
   ``I don't want to give credit when I don't know the facts,'' he
said.
   From the day he became president, Bush has been promising that
``goodwill begets goodwill'' an apparent invitation to the
kidnappers as well as Syria and Iran to free the Americans.
   Yet on Sunday, Bush said he was not making any goodwill gesture
merely because one hostage, Polhill, was freed.
   ``I don't go ante up one step and another,'' Bush said. ``I
rejoice at this release. ... And I will thank those who facilitated
the release and that's exactly the way it's going to stay.''
   In his earlier written statement, Bush had said his feeling of
satisfaction over Polhill's release was ``substantially tempered''
because other U.S. citizens and Westerners are still in captivity.
   He said nothing short of the release of all hostages would
satisfy him.
   ``That's the ground rules,'' he said in the statement. ``That's
the bottom line.''
   Separately, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said:
``We would hope that this release would be the forerunner to the
release of others and would pave the way towards the `goodwill
begets goodwill' summation at some point. But at this point, with
seven hostages still in captivity, the situation has not changed a
great deal.''
   Bush underscored that any response would await release ``of all
the hostages.'' He called hostage-taking ``an immoral practice''
that ``has to stop.''
   In Washington, Secretary of State James Baker III reaffirmed the
administration's position against making deals for hostages.
   ``Our policy is that we do not negotiate with hostage-holders
and we do not make deals for hostages,'' he said. ``And the reason
we don't is because we think that will simply lead to more and more
hostage-taking.''
   Bush, himself, made no further comments upon his return to the
White House Sunday evening.
   Notwithstanding the administration's posture, Rep. Lee Hamilton,
D-Ind., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the
Mideast, said Polhill's release would make it ``appropriate for the
United States to send some kind of a gesture that we're willing to
enter into a dialogue with Iran.''
   And in New York, Kamal Kharazzi, Iran's ambassador to the United
Nations, said his government was ``very hopeful that this process
would be sped up and more hostages would be released.'' But he said
that depends on ``the policies that the other sides would adopt.''
   Before Bush spoke directly with reporters, Fitzwater expressed
the president's appreciation for whatever roles Iran and Syria
played in Polhill's release.
   ``There were no deals, no negotiations with the hostage
takers,'' said Fitzwater. ``We have no way of identifying any
specific action on our part that could have been a contributing
factor'' to the release.
   Concerning Iran, which has bedeviled the United States in a
string of hostage events over the past 10 years, Fitzwater said:
``We do recognize their role. We do show some gratitude for any
help they may have given in this case. We continue to indicate that
this is a course of action that does beget good will.''
   Bush and Fitzwater both said they did not know whether Iran
played a big role in the Polhill release, but Fitzwater said: ``We
have always felt that Iran has control or influence over the
hostages. We continue to believe that.''
   Kharazzi, appearing with Hamilton on CBS-TV's ``Face the
Nation,'' said the situation was complex, with different groups
having different demands holding the hostages. He said Iran does
not have influence over all the captors.
   For days, Syria and Iran had been fueling hopes of an imminent
hostage release by the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine. The group has held three American educators seized from
Beirut University College: Polhill, 55, of New York; Jesse Turner,
42, of Boise, Idaho; and Alann Steen, a native of Boston, who
turned 51 Sunday.
   While expressing pleasure over Polhill's release, Bush said,
``Our satisfaction ... is substantially tempered by the knowledge
that seven other innocent Americans, as well as a number of foreign
nationals, are still being cruelly held hostage in Lebanon.
   ``We cannot rest until all hostages are free,'' he said. ``Once
again, we urgently call on all parties who hold hostages, or who
have any influence, to work to obtain the immediate and
unconditional release of the remaining hostages as a humanitarian
gesture.''
   Among the 18 Western hostages believed held in Lebanon, eight
are Americans. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was seized March
16, 1985.
   Bush has never spelled out how he might reciprocate following
the hostages' release.
   Iran is thought to be interested in obtaining billions of
dollars in assets frozen after Americans were taken hostage at the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979.
   Syria is trying to move back into the Arab mainstream after
years of isolation, and apparently is hoping to improve its image
in the West.

   A Canadian air force jet fighter
crashed Sunday into the Pacific Ocean about 18 miles west of
Vancouver Island, a military spokeswoman said. The fate of the
pilot was unknown.
   The one-man CF-18 crashed shortly after 2 p.m. PDT, said Maj.
Jan Martinsen of the Canadian Forces base in Cold Lake, Alberta. He
did not release the pilot's name.
   The aircraft was on routine training mission with a second
CF-18, she said.
   Search and rescue aircraft from the forces' base in Comox on the
British Columbian island were searching for the jet.
   The fighter is part of the 441 Tactical Fighter Squadron based
at CFB Cold Lake.
   The CF-18 is a version of the American-made F-18 fighter, built
by St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas.
   The crash was the second involving Canadian Forces F-18s in five
days. One pilot was killed and other slighly injured after two of
the Canadian jets collided over the West German city of Karlsruhe,
showering the city with flaming debris.
   The jets involved in Tuesday's crash were part of Canada's NATO
contingent.

<HEAD>Orthodox Party Boosts Shamir's Chances to Form Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small ultra-Orthodox party threw its support
behind caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Sunday, boosting
his chances of forming a new coalition government, Israel
television reported.
   The television said the spiritual leaders of the ultra-Orthodox
Shas Party ordered legislators to back Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc after Shamir pledged to advance the peace process.
   Also Sunday, an unidentified gunman opened fire at a bus in the
occupied West Bank carrying Jewish settlers, slightly wounding the
driver in the leg, the army said.
   Palestinians in the occupied territories, meanwhile, observed a
general strike ordered by the uprising's clandestine leadership in
support of Christian-Moslem solidarity. But uprising activists in
some West Bank towns canceled the strike, which coincided with the
Moslem fast month of Ramadan.
   In clashes throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip four
Palestinians were wounded in stone-throwing confrontations with
Israeli troops, Arab hospital officials said.
   Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat has urged
Palestinians to refrain from using guns during the uprising,
arguing Israel would respond with harsher tactics to end the
28-month-long uprising.
   Radical Palestinian factions and Moslem fundamentalists have
supported the use of firearms.
   The governing board of Shas reached their decision to support
the Likud shortly after Shamir met with the party's spiritual
leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, and clarified his stance on the peace
process, Israel TV reported.
   ``Rabbi Yosef and the Torah Sages were convinced by the Prime
Minister's desire and by his unequivocal announcement that he will
not retreat from the government's peace initiative and his desire
to reach peace with our neighbors,'' said
   Interior Minister Aryeh Deeri, a leading figuire in Shas, said
Shamir agreed not to ``retreat from the government's peace
initiative and his desire to reach peace with our neighbors.''
   The peace initiative calls for elections in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip to chose Palestinians to open talks with Israel
on an interim peace settlement.
   Shamir's office said the Prime Minister has not deviated from
his long-held position ruling out a PLO role in peace talks.
   Shamir's rival, Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, has also been
trying to put together a new governing coalition since Labor
engineered the collapse of the joint government on March 15.
   The 15-month government fell after the Likud refused to accept a
U.S. peace plan, which calls for preliminary negotiations between
Israelis and Palestinians. Shas' refusal to support Likud in the
no-confidence vote was crucial to the collapse of the coalition
government.
   Both Shamir and Peres have been courting Shas, which holds five
seats in Parliament. Shas' decision to back Likud Sunday leaves
both major parties in a deadlock, each controlling 60 of
Parliament's 120 seats.

   A reform Communist won a run-off
presidential election in Slovenia Sunday and a non-Communist
center-right party led in parliamentary elections in the
neighboring Yugoslav republic of Croatia.
   The elections enabled voters in the two republics to choose
among Communist reformers and Western-oriented leaders and could
further divide the Yugoslav federation.
   Communist-ruled Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six
republics, has accused some leaders in the two republics of being
fascist and bent on secession from the Balkan nation of 23 million.
   With 75 percent of the vote counted in Slovenia, reform
Communist Milan Kucan had 57.9 percent of the vote while his
opponent, Joze Pucnik, won 42.1 percent
   Kucan formerly headed the Slovene Communist Party, renamed the
Party of Democratic Reform. Pucnik, leader of the five-party DEMOS
coalition, has advocated Slovenia's secession from Yugoslavia.
   In Croatia, where more than 30 parties were entered in the
republics first free multiparty elections in 51 years, initial
results showed the center-right Croatian Democratic Union leading
in 13 out of the first 25 constituencies where counting was under
way.
   It was not clear whether the trend would continue. Croatia's
three-chamber Parliament has 356 seats.
   The reformist Communist Party was second with a lead in 10
constituencies, and the middle-of-the-road Coalition of National
Accord led in two districts.
   Sunday's balloting was for the 116-seat Chamber of Counties and
the 80-seat Socio-Political Chamber.
   An additional vote was to be held Monday for 160 seats in the
Labour Chamber.
   Some 2,000 supporters of the Croatian Democratic Union gathered
in the Zagreb electoral district of Dubrava, the home of party
leader Franjo Tudjman, to celebrate what they described as ``the
victory of the Croatian people.''
   ``I am convinced we will win an absolute majority and the Union
will form Croatia's first non-Communist administration,'' Tudjman
said.
   A second round of voting will be held in two weeks in
constituencies where no candidate won a majority.
   Despite Pucnik's loss in Slovenia, DEMOS will form the first
non-Communist government in any of Yugoslavia's six republics in 45
years. Two weeks ago, it won 55 percent of the seats in Slovenia's
regional legislature in the first round of elections.
   Kucan and Pucnik emerged as front-runners from first-round
voting when Kucan received 44.6 percent of the vote and Pucnik 26.6
percent. A total of 1.4 million Slovenians of a population of about
2 million were eligible to vote.
   Yugoslavia's last multiparty elections were held in 1939.
Opposition groups claim that a ballot in 1945 was rigged by the
Communist Party, which thereafter banned all dissent and turned the
country into a single-party state.
   The leader of the triumphant Croatian party, Tudjman, says his
party favors a confederation in which all of Yugoslavia's six
republics would have ``full sovereign rights.'' It is not bent on
secession, he said, denying the accusations from Serbia.
   Following its victory in the first round of the Slovenian
elections, DEMOS has also softened its stand on independence.
   Since the death in 1980 of Josip Broz Tito, the strong-willed
founder of communist Yugoslavia, a nine-person rotating presidency
representing the country's diverse ethnic makeup has headed the
country, under the guidance of the Communist Party. But ethnic
conflict and political dissent persist.
   Two other Yugoslav republics, Bosnia and Macedonia, have allowed
formation of opposition parties and are expected to schedule free
elections soon.
   But in Serbia, the largest constituent republic, and the
smallest region of Montenegro, the ruling Communists have yet to
formally legalize independent parties.

<TEXT>
   Four thousand teen-agers from 36
countries, carrying the memories of 6 million Jews killed by the
Nazis, made a ``March of the Living'' Sunday from the Auschwitz
concentration camp to the crematoria of Birkenau.
   Writer Elie Wiesel, diplomats and Israeli parliamentarians
joined the young marchers for the two-mile walk marking Holocaust
Memorial Day.
   The march at the camp in southern Poland was in memory of those
who died in Nazi death camps as well as in the Warsaw ghetto
uprising that began April 19, 1943.
   The sunny day turned eerily cloudy and light rain started as
Wiesel stood at a podium before a gray stone monument to recall his
youth at Auschwitz:
   ``I see them, forever I see them. ... Years and years ago I saw,
I cannot tell you what I saw. I'm afraid that if I told you we
would all wake up in tears and would not be able to stop. I see a
young girl ... ,'' he said before stopping, apparently unable to
continue, and silently leaving the podium.
   Many cried as the students, all wearing blue shirts, some
carrying Israeli flags and others bouquets of flowers, walked along
the train tracks that ended at the cremetoria.
   Dandelions waved in the wind-swept grass now covering the rubble
of the camp. Torches were lighted, poems read and mournful violin
songs played before a reading of the kaddish, a Jewish prayer for
the dead.
   Television cameras positioned in former Nazi watchtowers
broadcast live to Israel, where solemn Holocaust remembrance events
were under way.
   As the march began, Galia Haber, a Jerusalem high school
student, recalled seeing the number the Nazis tattoed on her
grandmother's arm at Auschwitz.
   ``I remember when I saw her I thought of a supermarket with
numbered goods and I thought, did somebody buy her? ... It's very
sad to think that my grandmother, whom I love so much ... once was
just a number,'' she told Israeli radio, which broadcast the march
live.
   Shawn Tepper, 17, of Miami Beach, Fla, held hands with a row of
other young American Jews and said the experience was overwhelming
but ``proved to everyone that we are alive, we are together and we
are strong.''
   Sunday's event was the second ``March of the Living.''
Participants said it had special significance because of the drive
toward German unification and Israel's rapid renewal of ties with
Eastern European countries that once had flourishing Jewish
communities.
   The Nazis built the Auschwitz complex in southern Poland as the
main engine of Hitler's ``Final Solution.'' Estimates of the death
count vary, but recent research has put the toll at about 1.5
million, more than 90 percent Jews.
   There were 1,500 participants in the first ``March of the
Living,'' held in 1988 to mark the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw
ghetto uprising. In the battle, several hundred Jewish insurgents
staged a desperate three-week struggle against the Nazi drive to
liquidate the last 75,000 inhabitants of the walled ghetto.
   U.S. and Israeli organizers plan to hold the march every two
years.
   About 3 million Polish Jews perished during World War II. Most
of the approximately 500,000 who survived from the prewar
population subsequently emigrated, many during an anti-Semitic
purge in 1968, and there are now only several thousand Jews in
Poland.

<HEAD>Vietnam Foreign Minister: Normalization Would Benefit Asia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam's Foreign Minister says normalizing
diplomatic relations between his country and the United States
could contribute to peace in Southeast Asia.
   The official, Nguyen Co Thach, said in an interview in this
week's Time magazine that Vietnam has met all the requirements set
by the U.S. government for improving relations.
   They include agreements on accounting for military personnel
missing in action in the war in Vietnam, reunification of
Vietnamese families and human rights abuses in re-education camps.
   ``But in the State Department there is no change'' toward
Vietnam, he complained.
   ``Normal relations between the U.S. and Vietnam could contribute
to peace and cooperation in Southeast Asia and to maintaining the
independence of this area vis-a-vis China,'' Thach said during the
interview which was conducted in Hanoi.
   He said the United States was using Vietnam's continued military
presence in neighboring Cambodia as an excuse to avoid normalizing
relations with his country.
   ``The Cambodian problem serves only as a pretext,'' Thatch said.
``The greatest mistake of the U.S. is not the Vietnam War. It is
this strategy of using Vietnam as a pawn in the relationship
between China and the U.S.
   ``It is time to heal the wounds of war,'' he said. ``I don't
mention the physical or the mental wounds, but the moral ones. As
long as this state of abnormal relations drag on, the moral wounds
will bleed.''
   According to a Time-CNN poll, 48 percent of the U.S. public and
44 percent of Vietnam veterans feel the time has come to
re-establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam.
   The poll, also in this week's Time, indicated that 58 percent of
Vietnam veterans believe that the U.S. was right to get involved in
the war, while 32 percent believe it was wrong. Only 29 percent of
the general public approves of the role the United States played in
Vietnam, and 57 percent disapproves.
   Sixty-one percent of the veterans said they are proud of their
role in the war, while 28 percent said they felt no pride. Among
the general public, 39 percent were proud of the U.S. role and 48
percent were not.
   The poll of 1,000 adults was conducted on April 9-10. The margin
of error is plus or minus 3 percent.

<HEAD>Chinese Premier Leaves For Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng left Monday for the first visit
in 26 years by a Chinese head of government to the Soviet Union,
China's longtime rival for leadership of the Communist world.
   Li's four-day trip is intended to promote normal, friendly
relations and an easing of border tensions at a time when both
countries are focused on serious internal problems.
   The official Chinese press hailed Li's trip as being of
``profound significance'' to peace in Asia and the world. But it is
expected to have few concrete effects on a relationship that has
slowly improved in recent years after decades of mistrust.
   The 61-year-old premier is to hold at least two rounds of talks
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who in May made the
first visit by a Soviet leader to Beijing in three decades.
   Gorbachev's historic visit was overshadowed by huge student-led
democracy demonstrations in Beijing, which ended weeks later when
Li and other hard-line Chinese leaders brought in troops to crush
the movement.
   The two sides are expected to sign an agreement on fostering
trade and will lay down guiding principles on easing military
confrontation along their 4,350-mile frontier.
   Progress is unlikely on territorial disputes or cutbacks in the
500,000 Soviet soldiers and more than 1 million Chinese troops
along the border.
   China and the Soviet Union split over ideological differences in
1960 and fought a brief border war in 1969. In 1972 China restored
relations with the United States, in part because then leader Mao
Tse-tung saw the Soviet Union as China's most serious military
threat.
   Western diplomats say improved relations with Moscow do not mean
China can play a ``Soviet card'' against the United States as
Sino-U.S. relations deteriorate over human-rights issues.
   China has stressed it will never be a Soviet ally as it was in
the 1950s, and China's inherent suspicions of Soviet aims have
grown with Gorbachev's reform policies.
   The ideological hard-liners who now rule China reportedly blame
Gorbachev for the fall of Communist parties in East Europe and see
his program of perestroika as leading to the demise of socialism.

   A bomb exploded during a
charity dance in a town just north of San Salvador, killing one
person and injuring 40 people, a Red Cross spokesman said Sunday.
   Fourteen of the injured in the explosion at a home in El Sitio
late Saturday were taken to hospitals for treatment, the spokesman,
Carlos Lopez Mendoza, said.
   He said the dance was held to collect funds to build a church.
El Sitio is near Apopa, seven miles north of the capital.
   ``Witnesses say that suddenly at 11 p.m. they heard a loud
explosion,'' Lopez Mendoza said. He did not know how many people
were attending the dance.
   There was no immediate indication of who threw or placed the
explosives or of what type were used, he said.
   The armed forces press office said it had no information on the
case.
   Earlier Saturday, an economics professor was killed in the
capital when a bomb exploded in his car as he was leaving the
University of El Salvador.
   No suspects had been identified in the attack on Randolfo
Tejada, who also was director of the Salvadoran Institute for
Rehabilitation of the Disabled, a police spokesman said.
   There was no claim of responsibility for that attack.
   Right-wing death squads have targeted academics and religious
activists during the decade-old civil war between leftist
guerrillas and a succession of U.S.-backed governments. More than
71,000 people have been killed, most of them civilians.

   The Sandinista army turned over an
eastern military base to U.N. observers Sunday, and the first
contingent of U.N. troops rolled into Nicaragua to enforce Contra
demobilization and disarmament.
   An accord signed Thursday by the Contras, the outgoing
Sandinista government and representatives of President-elect
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro requires a cease-fire verified by the
United Nations in seven security zones set up for demobilization.
   Mrs. Chamorro takes office Wednesday, ending the decade-old rule
of the leftist Sandinistas.
   About 2,400 Contra rebels began arriving at Los Chinamos near El
Ayote in the Fourth Security Zone Sunday, one hour after Sandinista
Mayor Bayardo Rodriguez turned over the El Ayote base to U.N.
forces.
   The mountainous security zone 175 miles east of the capital of
Managua encompasses El Ayote, Los Chinamos and three other towns.
   Sandinista troups moved to bases more than 40 miles away from
the security zone. The cease-fire accord requires they relocate at
least 12 miles away.
   A 15-vehicle caravan of about 170 U.N. troops from Venezuela
rolled across the Honduras border into Nicaragua at Las Manos, 156
miles north of Managua, Sunday, destined for the First Security
Zone.
   U.N. troops are scheduled to begin disarming Contras on
Wednesday in the first, second and third security zones, U.N.
spokeswoman Angelica Hunt said in an interview.
   A contingent of 193 Venezuelan soldiers arrived in Tegucigalpa,
the capital of Honduras, to the north of Nicaragua Sunday to join a
700-member U.N. battalion supervising the Contra demobilization in
Honduras and Nicaragua.
   The contingent is scheduled to enter Nicaragua Monday to
supervise disarmament in the second and third security zones, Hunt
said.
   About 30,000 people, mostly civilians, died in the 9-year-old
Nicaraguan war.

   Robert Polhill is being bombarded by sensations and emotions
after more than three years of captivity in Lebanon, and faces
physical and mental challenges in the coming months, former
hostages said after his release Sunday.
   ``Bob Polhill probably only learned he was gonna be released
about two hours ago,'' former hostage David Jacobsen said Sunday
afternoon.
   Polhill, 55, of New York was freed in Beirut nearly 39 months
after he and two other Americans were abducted from Beirut
University College on Jan. 24, 1987. He taken to Wiesbaden, West
Germany, for debriefing and a medical examination.
   Polhill will have to grapple with guilt, said retired Air Force
Col. Thomas E. Schaefer, one of the 52 Americans held hostage for
444 days in Iran.
   ``One of the major things he'll feel is: `Why did they let me
go?,''' Schaefer said. ``And the first thing I would tell him is
to, `Don't let it bother you,' because those guilt feelings are not
substantiated.''
   In a telephone interview from Peoria, Ariz., Schaefer said that
on his release in January 1981 he felt guilty that he'd been
captured and had put his family, the nation and the Air Force
through such an ordeal.
   After Schaefer was freed, he opened an agency to help people
deal with stress and adversity.
   Schaefer, 59, said Polhill will probably spend the next few days
physically recovering from his ordeal, then try to regain some
semblance of order in his life. He said Polhill will have to deal
with changes in the world, his loved ones and himself since he was
taken captive.
   ``He'll get the best professional help in the world in
Wiesbaden. And he will have access to whatever assistance he may
need,'' Schaefer said.
   Jacobsen, who was held in West Beirut from May 1985 to November
1986, said in a CBS News interview: ``I'm reliving my release and
the emotions of it.
   ``In the hour drive to Damascus from West Beirut, it's been the
first time he's been able to use all his senses to see more than 10
feet away; it's probably the first time he's been out of doors in
three years. He's been held in a little basement dungeon most of
that time,'' Jacobsen said.
   ``He's being bombarded. He's seing the stars, he's seeing
people, he's hearing noises, he's smelling the breeze, and
everything,'' the former hostage said.
   ``He is going to be thinking about his friends who remain
behind, wishing that they could be sharing that moment,'' Jacobsen
said. ``He's going to be very concerned that he says nothing that
in any way would jeopardize the welfare of his friends.''
   In an interview later with Syrian television, Polhill said he
was ``happy and grateful'' to people who worked on his case, but
remained deeply concerned about fellow captives Alann Steen and
Jesse Turner.
   Polhill was being taken to Wiesbaden, West Germany, for
debriefing and a medical examination, U.S. officials said.
   Schaefer said Polhill's next step will probably be dealing with
the press and requests to speak.
   ``It can be overpowering; he'll get thousands of requests,''
Schaefer said. ``He has to learn to say, `No.'''
   Schaefer credited his own recovery to the hostage reception team
and his wife, Anita.
   He said it took him several months to get over his ordeal, and
that for weeks after his release he would wake up screaming in the
middle of the night.
   ``It took me several months just to get used to crowds,'' he
said. Schaefer now requently speaks to groups, and said he has
spoken before about 250,000 students since his release.

<HEAD>Historian: Johnson Didn't Steal Election; Others Did</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lyndon Johnson didn't steal the
1948 Senate election, as a recent biography contends, but a
political boss might have rigged the election to get Johnson's
opponent, says a close Johnson associate.
   Joe B. Frantz, now a history professor, contends the election
was stolen for Johnson, possibly without his knowledge, by a
disgruntled south Texas political boss eager to derail the
opponent, Coke Stevenson.
   Johnson won the election by 87 votes out of almost a million
cast, collecting 99 percent of the south Texas vote.
   ``There's no question the election was stolen,'' Frantz said,
but he contends that political boss George Parr filched it to spite
Stevenson, not necessarily to help Johnson.
   Frantz said he revealed the information at a recent historical
society banquet because of accusations against Johnson by Robert A.
Caro in ``Means of Ascent,'' the second volume in Caro's biography
of Johnson.
   Frantz, a White House aide under Johson and former chairman of
the University of Texas history department, teaches at Corpus
Christi State University.
   Frantz put together the Oral History Project for the Johnson
Presidential Library in Austin, taping interviews with nearly 1,000
people, including Johnson's political enemies.
   He said his information about Parr's political vendetta against
Stevenson came from an interview he conducted with Stevenson when
the former governor was in his 80s. Stevenson died in 1975 at age
87.
   ``It would have been in the early 1970s,'' Frantz told The
Associated Press. ``He set me down and he said, `I'm going to give
you the straight story' ...''
   Stevenson and Parr had always been close allies, Stevenson told
Frantz, until Parr asked Stevenson, then governor, to name a
certain man judge at Laredo.
   Stevenson refused because ``the fellow was an absolute rascal
and into evey sort of political sin available,'' Frantz said.
   Parr promised revenge, the professor said.
   ``The feeling is that Parr decided, `I'm going to teach Coke
Stevenson a lesson and, at the same time, get in very good with the
new senator from Texas,''' Frantz said.
   Frantz was unable to locate Parr to interview him before Parr
died in the mid-1970s.
   Frantz said he interviewed the man responsible for disposing of
votes from a contested box before a recount could be held.
   He said he came away from the encounter convinced the south
Texans were guilty of stuffing the box, which disappeared after the
count, with illegal votes.
   ``They were a bunch of rascals,'' he said.
   Frantz said he thought Caro's characterization of Johnson in his
first volume, ``The Path to Power,'' was slanted against his
subject.
   He said that he felt that in the second book Caro expressed
annoyance ``as if Johnson had pulled off the dirtiest steal in
history. He doesn't see things in the context of the times.''
   ``We didn't know what a secret ballot was,'' Frantz said. ``I
grew up in Weatherford, and all the precincts used to vote in the
same room in the courthouse and all the courthouse hangers-on would
stand around and watch you.''
   It was not at all unusual for campaigners to know how a vote was
going before balloting ended, he said, and for people to round up
votes midway through the voting to counteract trends.
   ``I was sort of amused by Robert Caro's almost innocence in how
dirty all this was,'' said Frantz, former director of the Texas
State Historical Association. ``When the national press seized on
it, it's like he expected some sort of local paradox down here.
Actually it's no dirtier than anywhere else.''

   In the church where he preached for 30 years, the
Rev. Ralph David Abernathy was mourned Sunday by civil rights
leaders and citizens as a man ``high up on the honor roll'' of the
battle for racial equality.
   About 300 people lined up Sunday afternoon after the regular
service at the West Hunter Street Baptist Church, where the civil
rights leader was pastor from 1961 until his death last week at age
64.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King III, and former
Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were among
those mourning the man who marched and worked beside the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, but who angered many activists
with an autobiography they feel belittled King's memory.
   ``And the Walls Came Tumbling Down,'' published last year,
described King as having liaisons with women the night he was
assassinated in 1968.
   Many of those who criticized the book have since Abernathy's
death focused on his work helping King build the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference and pressing the case of equal rights for
blacks.
   At an evening memorial service, Abernathy's son, Kwame, told the
congregation his father was a ``truly selfless leader.''
   ```Abide in love' was one of the last things my daddy said,''
the younger Abernathy recalled.
   Jackson and Young, who worked with Abernathy and King in the
1960s, did not speak to the crowd, but embraced on the podium above
the casket.
   After the service, Young, a candidate for Georgia governor, said
Abernathy's sacrifices helped make Young's political successes
possible.
   ``I've never forgotten that and I won't ever forget it,'' Young
said.
   Jackson said Abernathy's death means a time ``for pause and
reflection'' among King's former aides.
   ``All of us have a profound sense of loss,'' Jackson said. ``We
must judge him on what he meant to our struggle and he was high up
on the honor roll.''
   The Rev. Robert G. Grant, president of the American Freedom
Coalition in Washington, commented on the epitaph Abernathy's wrote
for himself: ``I tried,'' Grant said, ``Yes, Ralph, you did try.
You tried to bring your people those normal things of life that
most people take for granted.''
   Abernathy, who was King's closest friend and advisor, died April
17 of a heart attack induced by a blood clot. Funeral services are
scheduled for noon Monday at West Hunter.
   Most of those who lined up early either were members of
Abernathy's church or residents of the neighborhood. The mourners,
some of whom carried children, walked quietly past the coffin, and
several touched the sleeves of his white minister's robe.
   Family members viewed Abernathy's body privately, then left the
church. One of Abernathy's daughters, Donzaleigh Abernathy Bosley,
arranged flowers around her father's open casket, and placed a
single red rose in his left hand.
   ``She won't leave him,'' a church aide whispered to another.
   Ethel Bell, 83, a member of West Hunter since 1932, said
Abernathy hinted during a February sermon that he expected to die.
   ``He said he had really enjoyed being pastor,'' she said. ``He
said he wanted us to always get along. That tells you something.''
   Morning services were sad, but proceeded as usual, said church
member Juanita H. Gardner.
   ``Every now and then there was a cry out of sadness,'' she said.
``It's a little sadder; that's to be expected.''

   Millions of Americans gathered in parks and on village greens
Sunday to celebrate a worldwide 20th anniversary party for Earth
Day, the environmental ``teach-in'' that launched a movement.
   Thousands watched a hot-air balloon decorated as the Earth rise
in New York's Times Square where the ball falls on New Year's Eve.
Students at Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania buried a paper
mache ``Old Earth'' containing a plastic foam cup, aerosol can,
disposable diaper and container of leaded gasoline.
   In all, an estimated 3,600 American cities and towns mustered
forces to rejuvenate the environmental movement, born with the
original Earth Day in 1970.
   ``I get a real sense of a renewal, and a kind of rededication,
that will provide the support for change at the grass-roots
level,'' said John McLachlan, scientific director at the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Research Triangle
Park, N.C. ``There's a sense of urgency that hasn't been there.''

republic to catastrophe, and denied the Kremlin has imposed a total
economic blockade.
   The Sajudis independence movement, whose leaders dominate
Lithuania's government, declared its determination to stand by the
March 11 declaration of independence.
   In neighboring Latvia, meanwhile, the drive for independence
received a show of support in a rally attended by 9,000 newly
elected members of city councils, regional bodies and the
republic's parliament, a journalist reported.
   The streets of Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, were calm, with
people walking rather than using cars as they coped with stringent
gasoline rationing that permits about 7 gallons per month for

troops for control of the capital of Lagos.
   The rebellion in Africa's most populous nation was launched by
middle-ranking officers opposed to President Gen. Ibrahim

federation of 19 states to end Moslem domination.
   ``The unfortunate situation in Lagos this morning has been

   Real estate problems are spreading from the
Southwest and Northeast, threatening metropolitan markets across
the nation, according to a new statistical analysis by banking
regulators.
   Banks in regions already beset with falling or flat real estate
prices have responded by tightening their lending policies. An
analysis by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. shows that lenders
elsewhere also may have reason for concern.
   The FDIC, which insures bank and savings and loan deposits up to
$100,000, has fashioned what it hopes will be an early warning
system that identifies soft real estate markets before they turn
sour.
   A preliminary version released last week examined commercial
real estate in 40 metropolitan areas. Some well-known sore spots in
the Southwest ranked high on the list. Phoenix, Ariz.; was first,
Austin, Texas, was sixth and Oklahoma City was seventh.

   It was like a journey back in time when the
National AIDS Commission traveled to south Georgia last week for a
firsthand look at how rural areas are coping with the deadly
disease.
   ``I'm afraid we're seeing history repeat itself,'' said Dr. June
Osborn, chairwoman of the panel, after the commission spent two
days in Waycross, Albany and Macon visiting with AIDS patients and
talking with health care professionals.
   ``The same fear, the same isolation for people with AIDS, the
same difficulty in mobilizing coordinated care that we saw in the
beginning of the urban epidemic back a few years ago is happening
all over again,'' she said.
   The commission's trip came on the heels of a federal Centers for
Disease Control report that AIDS is spreading more rapidly in rural
areas than in cities. From 1988 to 1989, the CDC found that
nonmetropolitan areas had a 37 percent increase in new AIDS cases
while metro areas had only a 5 percent gain.

<TEXT>
   The pan-European stock market is proving an
elusive dream.
   Europe's major exchanges agree there should be one market in the
big European stocks, to provide greater liquidity and efficiency.
But they disagree over how to create it.
   The efforts have been slow, piecemeal, and contradictory. This
is increasingly helping London's aggressive International Stock
Exchange dominate the European financial centers.
   Europe has 39 national and major regional stock exchanges
trading about 300 major European stocks.
   Fragmented, structurally diverse, they not only compete with
each other but with less formal trading systems comprised of
telephone links and computerized videoscreen networks.
   Moreover, they soon will face competition from the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, also known
as NASDAQ. The American screen-based, over-the-counter market plans
to begin operating during European hours in the third quarter of
this year.
   The demand for a pan-European market comes from big
international institutional investors, who want to trade in
Europe's stocks in a single market in the European time zone.
   Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of London's exchange, a year ago
said the answer was a Europe-wide screen-based trading system,
which London already has.
   Addressing a conference in Frankfurt last month, Hugh Smith
proposed a joint initiative by London and the German Federation of
Stock Exchanges as ``the critical mass, the focus, upon which a
truly European market could be built.''
   Regis Rousselle, head of the Paris exchange, has suggested
creating a Single European List of 300 major stocks that could be
traded on any exchange.
   The Federation of European Community Stock Exchanges, meanwhile,
is planning ``le Pipe,'' a system to provide European stock prices
and company information. A single network will transmit data
prepared by the 12 Common Market exchanges, and it might develop
into a trading system.
   The major investment firms increasingly are engaging in informal
pan-European trading through their own computerized video-screens,
away from the exchanges. But this leaves investors less protected
because there's less surveillance to detect cheating and
irregularities.
   Europe's exchanges have talked for decades about cooperating,
and it was hoped action would replace words with the approach of
1992, when the EEC theoretically becomes a barrier-free marketplace
of 320 million consumers.
   But Stewart Gilchrist, a director of Scottish Amicable
Investment Managers, a Glasgow-based institutional investor, said:
``I don't think we are particularly optimistic...''
   Frank Lewis, executive director of European trading at Shearson
Lehman Hutton International Inc. in London, said a pan-European
market was an impractical ideal.
   ``Every local market is always going to fight to maintain their
local autonomy and their individuality,'' Lewis said. ``There's
also a hesitancy on the part of the customers.''
   For instance, someone investing in Portugal is likely to believe
that a Portuguese broker is the best-qualified to offer advice,
Lewis said. ``That is the perception and is to a large degree true
and can be overcome, but it's an uphill battle.''
   London's exchange has used a screen-based system called SEAQ
International for five years, enabling it to win business from
other European exchanges and develop substantial trade in
international shares.
   It also benefits from being English-speaking and better
established than its continental counterparts.
   Hugh Smith estimated that about one-fifth of West German stock
trading takes place in London, where trade in non-British shares
grew to $50.5 billion in February from $41 billion in September.
   London accounted for 35 percent of Europe's total market
capitalization of $1.8 trillion at the end of 1988, figures
provided by London's exchange show. Germany came in second, with 13
percent, and France, third, with 11.5 percent.
   The market capitalization figure represents the total value of
all domestic shares listed on the major exchanges.
   West Germany is fighting back by modernizing. Last year it
launched a screen-based reporting system called IBIS, which
provides prices in blue-chip stocks to the country's eight
exchanges.
   One hurdle to harmonization is the wide differences in the way
the exchanges make the final swap of cash for shares, known as the
clearing and settlement process. The exchanges face competition
from private companies operating as clearing houses.
   Britain's system is among the worst, piling up huge backlogs. To
remedy this, London's exchange will start operating a paperless
settlement system called Taurus in October 1991.
   London's trading is ``quote-driven,'' with many market makers
competing for business by offering the best price. They have
abandoned the exchange floor for screens and phones in their
offices.
   But this method has generated such fierce competition that it
has driven many market makers out of the British equities business.
The sluggish volume following the October 1987 stock market crash
hasn't helped.
   Other major exchanges are ``order-driven,'' with buyers and
sellers matched at a central point by market makers known as
specialists.
   Their role is similar to that of New York Stock Exchange
specialists, who are entrusted with the responsibility of keeping
markets orderly, partly through buying and selling shares from
their own inventories.
   The weakness of the Continent's trading centers became evident
during the near-crash last October. Many of the exchanges shut down
when they couldn't handle the flood of sell orders.
   Many European exchanges _ not London _ also have ``circuit
breakers'' which limit how far shares can fluctuate in a session.
   Europe's exchanges have scrambled to modernize and deregulate in
recent years. The growth of competition in the 1980s has broken
down many clubby cartels with their fixed, high commissions and
webs of regulations.
   Britain led with ``Big Bang,'' the sweeping 1986 deregulation
that allowed foreign firms and commercial banks to deal in
securities and permitted more participants to make markets in
stocks.

<HEAD>Stockholders To Vote on Getting Out of Tobacco Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If a Catholic priest from New York has his
way, Philip Morris Cos. will stop making and selling cigarettes by
the year 2000.
   The Rev. Michael Crosby successed in getting a no-cigarettes
resolution introduced at the 1990 annual meeting of the maker of
Marlboros after two years of failed legal attempts.
   Shareholders will vote on the issue Thursday during the New
York-based food and tobacco company's annual meeting in Richmond.
   ``We know the cards are stacked against us,'' said Crosby, who
coordinates the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility in
New York.
   Not surprisingly, management of the multi-billion-dollar company
is urging stockholders to vote against the resolution, which is
included in Philip Morris' proxy statement.
   ``The cigarette business is the company's original core
business. It has been and remains an important and lawful
business,'' management's statement said.
   ``It is a major contributor to the company's profitability,''
the company said. ``The board believes that the proposal is
ill-conceived and would be highly detrimental to the company.''
   In 1989, $17.9 billion, or 39 percent, of Philip Morris' $44.8
billion in revenue came from domestic and foreign tobacco
operations. The rest came from the company's interest in beer,
food, real estate and financial services.
   Philip Morris has moved away from tobacco and into other
businesses with its purchases of Kraft and General Foods, which
together form the largest food company in the United States and
Canada.
   Philip Morris, which operates a cigarette factory in Richmond,
has 11 percent of the world market for cigarettes. Its Marlboro
brand is the world's best-selling consumer packaged product.
   Crosby's proposal is not the only anti-smoking shareholder issue
before tobacco companies this year.
   American Brands Inc., for example, faces a similar measure that
would force the Old Greenwich, Conn., company to get out of the
tobacco business.
   Crosby's proposal also is not the only one attacking Philip
Morris and its tobacco business. Another is aimed at preventing the
sale of cigarettes to children, or the promotion of them for
children.
   The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America secured that item on
the agenda, and Philip Morris management also opposes it.
   ``The purpose of the company's cigarette advertising and
promotional activities is to persuade smokers to purchase our
brands rather than those marketed by our competitors,'' the company
said in its proxy. ``These activities are not directed to minors;
nor are they intended to induce anyone to smoke.''
   While the proposals are unlikely to succeed, they are designed
to draw attention to health problems associated with smoking, said
Crosby, who will get five minutes during the meeting to discuss his
measure.
   Crosby hopes to get at least 3 percent of the about 925.6
million outstanding shares on a ``smoke-free'' Philip Morris. Under
federal rules, that would get the issue on next year's ballot
without a legal fight.

<HEAD>Software Maker Plans To Add 1,000 Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Software publisher Microsoft Corp. said it
plans to add at least 1,000 employees this year, increasing its
worldwide employment by about one-fifth.
   Microsoft, the nation's largest producer of personal computer
software, has 4,800 employees worldwide, including 2,600 at its
Redmond headquarters outside Seattle.
   Most of the new employees will be software engineers and
technical personnel at the headquarters, Microsoft administration
director Raymond Ferguson said.
   Ferguson said Microsoft wants to add about 1,000 workers
annually to keep up with rapid growth. He also said the company
plans to add two, 160,000-square-foot buildings to its
800,000-square-foot headquarters.
   Microsoft has 16 offices in the United States and 22 others
worldwide.
   Microsoft's profits rose 83 percent to $310.9 million in the
quarter ended March 31, while revenue climbed 45 percent to $846.5
million. Sales in the past year topped $1 billion for the first
time.
