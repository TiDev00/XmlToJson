   The lead prosecutor in New York's ``pizza
connection'' heroin trial was named Friday to coordinate the
investigation in the bombing deaths of a federal judge and a black
Savannah lawyer.
   Louis Freeh, an assistant U.S. Attorney in New York, was named
to head the Justice Department investigation and prosecution of the
case.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said he picked an outside
prosecutor to oversee the probe because the mail bombs case spanned
several jurisdictions.
   Freeh handled the 17-month New York trial of an Mafia ring that
distributed tons of heroin and cocaine in the United States. He won
prosecutions against 18 members of the $1.6 billion ring that used
pizzerias as fronts to distribute large amounts of heroin and
cocaine from 1975 to 1984.
   The reputed former chief of the Sicilian Mafia, Gaetano
Badalamenti, and his associate, Salvatore Catalano, received
45-year prison terms for running the ring.
   In the present case, four packages containing explosives were
sent to sites in Alabama, Florida and Georgia over a four-day
period in mid-December. Two of them exploded, killing 11th U.S.
Circuit Court Judge Robert S. Vance at his home near Birmingham,
Ala., and Savannah Alderman Robert Robinson at his law office.
   Packages containing explosives were removed from the 11th
Circuit's headquarters building in Atlanta and the Jacksonville,
Fla., office of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   ``Hundreds of law enforcement personnel have been working on
this investigation and cooperation among the various districts has
been excellent,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``As this multi-district investigation has progressed, however,
it has become evident that the naming of the a single coordinating
prosecutor with overall responsibility is essential,'' the attorney
general said.

<HEAD>Ex-Security Chief Arrested After Criticizing Collor's Policy</HEAD>

   The army on Friday ordered the
arrest of Brazil's former secret service chief after he criticized
President Fernando Collor de Mello and the new government's
economic reform plans, officials said.
   Also disciplined for similar criticism was retired Gen. Euclydes
Figueiredo, the brother of former military President Joao
Figueiredo.
   Carlos Tinoco, the minister of the army, announced the
punishments in a televised interview.
   The presidential palace refused to comment.
   Both generals were punished under a military code that prohibits
military personnel from making political statements or attacks on
the president to the press without authorization from an armed
forces minister.
   The confrontation underlies growing tensions between Collor and
conservative elements of Brazil's armed forces.
   Tinoco said Gen. Newton Cruz, the former head of the recently
abolished secret service, was ordered arrested for 10 days in an
army barracks in Brasilia after attacking Collor in an interview
published Friday in the O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper.
   Cruz criticized Collor for firing 400,000 public employees
earlier this week to speed his anti-inflation program.
   ``I think we live in a dictatorship validated by the judiciary
and the Congress,'' Cruz was quoted as saying. ``If former
President Jose Sarney erred by lacking authority and determination,
Collor fails for his excessive aggressiveness.''
   Tinoco said Cruz confirmed ``basically all of his criticisms.''
   Euclydes Figueiredo was also severely reprimanded for defending
Cruz's criticisms in a separate article, Tinoco said.
   In addition to scrapping the 29-year-old secret service, Collor
has irked a number of generals by opening up classified files of
political opponents to the 1964-85 right-wing military regime.
   Figueiredo ended military rule by turning the presidency over to
Sarney, a civilian, but the military exerted great influence during
the five-year Sarney administration.

Texas</HEAD>

   A federal appeals court panel Friday upheld
Texas' countywide elections for judges, ruling 2-1 that black
voting strength isn't illegally diluted by electing as many as 59
judges at large from one county.
   The three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton's decision that the
elections in nine urban Texas counties illegally dilute the
strength of minority voters.
   ``While elected judges are representatives in that they are
accountable to a constituency of electors, the full authority of a
trial judge's office is exercised exclusively by one individual,
and there can be no share of such a single-member office,'' the
panel said in its decision. ``Consequently, the countywide election
of district court judges does not violate the Voting Rights Act.''
   Bunton, ruling last November on a lawsuit by the League of
United Latin American Citizens, ordered Texas to divide the nine
counties into electoral subdistricts and to hold nonpartisan
elections in those districts.
   Bunton had directed the elections be held May 5, but the
appellate court has stayed that order.
   The counties _ which include Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, San
Antonio, Austin and four smaller cities _ elect 172 of Texas' 390
district judges.
   Friday's decision ``is clearly good news for our judicial system
and for the people of Texas,'' said Gov. Bill Clements. ``By its
decision today, the panel ruled that Texans will retain the right
to elect all trial judges who serve in their local county
courthouse.''
   ``As Texas' chief elections officer and a defendant in this
lawsuit, I am extremely pleased with this action,'' said Texas
Secretary of State George Bayoud.
   The League of United Latin American Citizens, a major minority
rights group based in San Antonio, didn't immediately return
telephone calls seeking comment.
   The losing side can petition the panel for a rehearing, or
appeal to the Supreme Court.
   Appeals Judge Sam D. Johnson of Austin disagreed with the ruling
by Judge Patrick Higginbotham of Dallas, who voted with Judge
Carolyn Dineen King of Houston.
   ``I am totally at odds with the majority's application of the
so-called single officeholder exception,'' Johnson wrote in his
dissent.
   He said the majority incorrectly based its decision on a New
York case involving three candidates elected from three different
districts. ``The majority expands (this) beyond its logical
bounds,'' wrote Johnson.
   Under Texas law, district judges are elected every four years.
They run at-large, with all voters in a county allowed to vote in
every race.
   Bunton said the at-large elections deny Hispanic and black
voters an equal chance to elect the candidates they want.
   The appellate panel rejected Texas' arguments that judges are
not representatives, and that Congress didn't mean judicial
elections to fall under the Voting Rights Act.
   But it also rejected the central argument brought by the league:
that each judge is part of a larger court which should have more
black representatives.
   ``Indisputably, district judges in Texas share administrative
tasks with other district judges in the same county,'' it said.
``Equally indisputably, however, the district judge in Texas does
his judging alone.''

   With Memorial Day on the horizon and
floods in the foreground, Lake Texoma businesses that spend
millions to lure fishermen and boaters are worrying about swamped
marinas and closed campsites.
   Intermittent rains fell over the region Friday and showers are
forecast for the next few days, but some business owners hope they
can recover in time for Memorial Day, the first big holiday of the
season.
   ``You always think things won't get this bad,'' said Arnold
Perkins, president of the Lake Texoma Association. ``We've had
floods 10 to 15 feet above normal _ that's a bad flood. We're
talking 24 feet above level now.''
   Normal elevation at Lake Texoma, on the Red River at the Texas
line, is 617 feet above sea level. It crested Monday at 644.76
feet, dipped to 641.4 Friday, but still sloshes window-high on
mobile homes once 100 feet from its shore.
   A restaurant, disco and marina complex used by 5,000 to 6,000
people a day during the summer, was submerged and has been flooded
for three weeks. David Hull, who leases the property, estimates
damage at $2 million.
   About 700 concession workers have been laid off because heavy
rains in the region pushed the lake to its highest levels since it
was built in 1944.
   Some campsites, lodges and golf courses are open, but word is
out that Lake Texoma has suffered its worst flooding since 1957,
and that could be as big a blow to the tourism industry as the
flooding itself, Perkins said.
   The rains in Oklahoma and Texas filled lakes to their brims,
causing flooding in the two states and Arkansas as water was
released downstream on the Arkansas and Red rivers.
   The Army Corps of Engineers said its expects a greater volume of
water to move safely through the Red River flood control system
than did in the disastrous floods of 1957 and 1927. Texas had a
dozen flood-related deaths; Oklahoma, one.
   Corps spokesman Ed Engelke said the 20 camping areas around Lake
Eufaula in eastern Oklahoma all have limited access because of high
waters there. He said rangers must check for damage before the
sites are fully accessible.
   Downstream in Arkansas, where the Arkansas River is receding
from its crests at Little Rock and Pine Bluff, the Red River
crested 8 feet above flood stage Thursday at Fulton and closed
westbound lanes of Interstate 30.
   ``We're looking at 80 square miles of flooding,'' said Jim
Barnes, head of the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service in Little River County. ``It stretches for six
miles.''
   Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon asked President Bush on Friday for
federal disaster assistance for 36 of Oklahoma's 77 counties
because of the floods.
   In Texas, where severe flooding extended along the Trinity River
from north Texas to the Gulf Coast, the Red has flooded 40 homes
near Texarkana, where National Guard troops were in their fourth
day of reinforcing levees.
   At Lake Grapevine near Dallas, some say it could take months for
boat ramps to be reopened because of recent high waters.
   ``Summertime is like our Christmas. We only make it three months
out of the year,'' said Terri Berthelsen, manager of the Landing
Snack Shop at the marina. ``We pulled through last year on our
savings _ this year we don't know what is going to happen.''
   On Lake Texoma, Caney Creek Resort owner Virginia Wornom said
business slowed considerably in the last week and should stay
through Memorial Day and beyond, ``until people realize we haven't
floated off.''
   ``In the next two weeks, all the marinas should be in condition
to take care of the public,'' Perkins said, but on Friday about
half were either under water or inaccessible.
   Perkins said water covered the roads leading to his marina in
Denison, Texas. His restaurant, once 5 feet deep in water, reopened
Friday.
   He and other proprietors say they can't begin to guess at the
amount of the damage until the water recedes. The Corps of
Engineers has said it could be 45 to 60 days before the lake
returns to a ``decent level.''
   Perkins and other business owners have their eye on the holiday
weekend, traditionally a huge kickoff for a season that runs
through Labor Day.
   ``We were booked solid for Memorial Day, but we've had a lot of
cancellations,'' said Marion Stone, owner of Soldier Creek Resort
and Marina. ``People are not going to come to the lake.''
   James Atnip, superintendent of Lake Texoma State Park, said park
officials are trying to be positive, even though 270 of the 300
campsites are closed and tree limbs and other debris are scattered
across the lake.
   ``There's not going to be a Lake Texoma this summer,'' said Mrs.
Stone. ``All the beaches are under water. The water is murky. The
publicity has been harmful, but we try not to mislead people.''

   The pedestrian _ the most flexible, inexpensive
and pollution-free unit of transportation _ is being driven into
Manhattan streets by sidewalk obstructions.
   Obstacles range from construction scaffolding to slow-moving
out-of-towners.
   This becomes apparent on the west side of Lexington Avenue each
weekday afternoon at 5:23 when, according to scientific studies,
the sidewalk between 42nd and 43rd streets is the most crowded on
the planet.
   Almost 160 pedestrians a minute squeeze through a channel
usually narrowed to 4 feet by newspaper vending machines, trash
cans, street and traffic light poles, a newsstand, a table selling
exotic oils and incense, a flower stand and a tank of refrigerated
liquid nitrogen.
   Something has to give, so the pedestrians step off the curb _ a
few at first, then more, until at least a third of the thousands
steaming toward Grand Central Terminal are doing so in the dubious
safety of the Lexington Avenue bus lane.
   ``The pedestrian has been losing ground in the struggle for
space in Manhattan,'' according to a report by the borough
president's office, ``and that is a serious problem in an
environment which depends so heavily on walking for its mobility.''
   Another reminder of how serious a problem came last week.
   Erica Moreno, 3, was walking hand-in-hand with her mother in
40th Street because a construction project had closed the sidewalk.
A driver lost control of his car and smashed another vehicle into
the girl, killing her.
   Each year, cars and trucks in New York kill more than 600
pedestrians and injure 15,000. William H. Whyte, an urban planner
who has counted and studied pedestrians on Lexington and streets
all over the world, says New Yorkers try to bully cars with an
attitude of ``make way for me or kill me.''
   But walking is vital on a crowded island where 60 percent of
eligible adults don't even have a driver's license, and Whyte says
pedestrians in Manhattan walk longer and faster than any place in
America.
   They need space, however, and Manhattan's already congested
streets and sidewalks have been tied up by the financial services
boom of the 1980s, which brought in more workers, and the attendant
construction boom, which closed down more sidewalks.
   Then there are tourists. A male New York pedestrian's cruising
speed can exceed 350 feet a minute; visitors from less populous
communities often move at 250 feet a minute, and they have been
seen doing so three abreast. As a result, locals are always walking
up the heels of out-of-towners.
   But the biggest problem is the dimension and condition of the
city's pedestrian infrastructure _ the sidewalks. On Lexington
between 42nd and 60th much of the pavement is cracked or buckled,
sloping in spots at 20 degrees. It is full of holes and hollows,
some with semipermanent puddles replenished by rain and snow in
winter, and by condensate from store air conditioners in summer.
   At 12{ feet, Lexington's sidewalks are far narrower than Fifth
Avenue's (22 feet), and they usually are further reduced by various
obstacles. Traffic is reduced to one lane at the northwest corner
of 60th by a subway entrance, construction scaffolding and a
``newsstand'' selling everything but washing machines.
   Most of the space along Lexington goes to vehicles, even though
the pedestrian volume at the Lexington entrance to Grand Central is
rivaled only by one approach to Tokyo's Shinjuku rail station.
   About 78 percent of the people moving along the avenue at peak
periods are on foot; only 22 percent are in vehicles. Yet only 34
percent of the avenue's total space is given to pedestrians (20
percent of that usable), while vehicles get 66 percent.
   To pedestrians, the solution seems obvious: damn the motorists
and widen the sidewalks. The city plans the latter on Sixth Avenue
above 42nd Street, where it will narrow each vehicular lane to add
3 feet of sidewalk. Drivers and many businesses oppose such
tactics, but later this year a coalition of environmental groups
will ask the city to begin a broad program of sidewalk expansion
and reconstruction.
   Until that happens there will be more jaywalking, more midblock
crossing, more people in the bus lane, according to Peter Hecht of
the Project for Public Spaces, who has filmed and studied
pedestrian movements.
   Street walking, he says, ``is the pedestrian's way of saying the
sidewalks are too crowded. They're voting with their feet.''

   Adam Gotner, badly wounded, survived that
bloody day when police opened fire on people in the street. Twenty
years later, Solidarity runs the government and he leads a search
for secretly buried bodies.
   Dec. 17, 1970 is etched in Polish memory as a day of slaughter.
At 6 a.m., Gotner and many others were walking to their jobs at the
Paris Commune shipyard.
   Tanks and police were posted at the shipyard gates. Suddenly,
the police began shooting.
   Gotner, then 25, felt something hit his shoulder and saw his
jacket turning red. He thought of running at the tanks, ``but I
realized it would be instant suicide,'' and retreated.
   ``All this time, for several minutes, I could hear the shooting
continuing, and then it seemed I was stepping on people,'' he said.
   ``I had the impression I was stepping on bodies. The whole
street had been covered with people going to work. In my mind,
there were at least 500 dead.''
   Long afterward, Gotner realized most were not dead, but either
wounded or sprawling for cover.
   The communist authorities had declared the port and shipyard
closed because of unrest over government-imposed increases in food
prices, but had not told the workers. Police may have thought the
men intended to occupy the shipyard.
   Official accounts said 45 Baltic port and shipyard workers were
killed that day, 28 of them in Gdynia and Gdansk. Many Poles
believe the number was much higher.
   A committee led by Gotner is trying to determine how many died
in Gdynia, which means digging for bodies. Two excavations have
yielded no conclusive results.
   A macabre legend grew around the ``December events'' and the
authorities contributed to it by collecting bodies and burying them
hastily at night, often with no relatives present.
   Tombstones erected later were allowed to say only that the
person honored had died a ``tragic death.'' No mention of the
Gdynia killings was permitted in the state-controlled press.
   Attempts to investigate were blocked even in 1980-81,
Solidarity's first brief experience of legal existence.
   Censorship was eased enough to allow Andrzej Wajda to make the
acclaimed movie ``Man of Iron,'' in which the 1970 Gdynia killings
are portrayed as central to the rise of Solidarity a decade later.
   Gotner survived five bullet wounds in the chest, eventually
became a Solidarity activist in Gdynia and organized a civic
committee this year to build a new monument to the victims in front
of City Hall.
   Soon after it was formed, his committee came under public
pressure to investigate the killings. With the Communist Party out
of power, city officials agreed.
   On a sunny April day at the Witominski Cemetery, gravediggers
lifted the coffin of Jadwiga Sikorska from a sandy hillside and
probed a little deeper.
   They found two sets of bones wrapped in cloth. One was too old
to be from 1970; the other did not appear old enough.
   A representative of the prosecutor's office was present and the
remains were taken to a forensic laboratory for analysis.
   Mrs. Sikorska's son, Jerzy, had noticed bones in the earth when
he buried his mother in March and told the committee.
   Earlier, 70 volunteers dug up a 60-foot stretch of path in
another part of the cemetery where witnesses had reported signs of
newly dug graves immediately after the 1970 shootings. No bodies
were found.
   Experts confirmed part of the path had been dug up about 20
years ago, but only to a depth of about four feet. They said there
was no evidence the soil had been disturbed below that depth for
hundreds of years.
   ``There were several hypotheses, and mine is that they were
preparing to bury bodies there and then decided not to because of
personnel changes in the government,'' Gotner said in an interview
at his modest apartment overlooking the shipyard.
   He is a slender, articulate man with dark, curly hair salted
with gray, and is cautious in expressing opinions about the outcome
of his search. When pressed, Gotner said: ``I think it may turn out
to be true that five or 10 more people were killed than has been
reported.''
   That conclusion would not be popular. ``Already, I have heard
gossip that the fact that we have not found anything proves we are
on the side of the authorities,'' he said.
   Several people claimed to have seen secret burials. Three
witnesses who appeared reliable, including a militiaman, claim to
have seen about 200 bodies.
   Gortner noted, however, that ``no one is coming to us and asking
us to find somebody,'' despite public appeals for information.
   Whether the victims were more or fewer, Gotner said, ``we want
to find the truth. We cannot let half-truths continue to exist if
we want to build the future.''
   He removed his shirt, revealing scars on the upper chest and a
very deep exit wound in his back.
   ``If I had known I had five bullets in me, I would have died of
fright,'' he said, and laughed.
   The laughter gone, Gotner said: ``Doing this is my
responsibility to those who died at that time. I remember when I
was walking and I saw someone falling down. I wanted to to help him
then, but I could not.''

   The American press ought not to be described
as free because its members keep playing the same tune, according
to an assessment by a controversial Russian magazine editor
reported in Friday editions of The Washington Post.
   ``All our stay in this country is described with the same
epithets, the same words, the same expressions, as if it was
Xeroxed,'' Stanislav Kunayev was quoted as saying.
   Kunayev, editor of Nash Sovremennik (Our Contemporary), was one
of eight editors and writers chosen by the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
for their Russian nationalist views for a month-long tour of the
United States.
   Jewish organizations protested the visit, saying Kunayev and
others in the delegation advocated anti-semitic views. The sponsor,
the U.S. Information Agency, defended the choices on the grounds
that everybody could benefit from a close look at a free, open
society.
   Kunayev was interviewed at a reception at Columbia University in
New York City, the newspaper reported.
   He was quoted as saying, ``You folks in America worry too much
about the Jews. They're not that bad off.''
   He called the controversy over the visit ``primitive and
ludicrous'' and said, ``I don't see any reason to call the American
press a free press in relation to us.''
   Kunayev, who has been quoted as saying he supports the United
Nations resolution equating Zionism with racism, told the
interviewer he opposes the form of Zionism that spreads reports of
what he called ``nonexistent pogroms.''
   He criticized the extremist Russian patriotic group, Pamyat, on
the grounds that ``their practice helps Zionists'' but added that
the group is ``a phantom which is exaggerated by propaganda.''
   Viktor Likhonosov, an author, described the tour: ``By and
large, there was no chance for dialogue, the way the newspapers
were proceeding.
   ``It's particularly surprising when you know you're not the way
you're represented and you think you're behaving honorably. Even
during the Cold War, they received governmental people with more
understanding.''
   Kunayev said, ``Between all the nationalities (in the Soviet
Union) we have very tense relationships, and the Jewish question is
not the most important one.''

   The nation's toughest penitentiary will be
losing that distinction along with some of its most hardened
criminals now that federal officials have decided to build a new
prison in Colorado.
   The changeover is still more than 2{ years away. But it will
mark the end of almost three decades in which U.S.
Penitentiary-Marion has served as the nation's Alcatraz, housing
inmates no other prison is equipped to handle _ guard killers,
escape artists and spies.
   ``You don't get into Marion by being a nice person,'' said Terry
Finnegan, administrator at Marion, the nation's only federal
penitentiary rated as level six, the highest level of security.
   The Federal Bureau of Prisons decided four months ago to build a
complex at Florence, Colo., said Jack Crosley, assistant warden at
Marion. It will include a level-six section with space for 500
inmates, and when it is finished, Marion will be remodeled and
downgraded to a level five.
   Construction of the new prison hasn't begun but is expected to
be finished in December 1992. It should be cheaper than modernizing
Marion, which was built in 1963, Crosley said. The prison will be
designed so that one guard can control the movements of prisoners
in several cellblocks using electronic doors, cameras and audio
equipment.
   Even with its tight security, Marion has had to resort to
locking most of its approximately 360 prisoners in their cells 23
hours a day since October 1983, when two guards and one inmate were
killed in a series of confrontations.
   Once the new prison is built, Marion prisoners won't be
transferred en masse, said John L. Clark, who took over as Marion's
warden in January.
   ``It will happen in slow transition. We will take one or two
cell houses at a time so that the staff can get their feet on the
ground,'' said Clark.
   Marion's 230 guards have mixed feelings about losing their level
six status, Clark said in a recent interview.
   ``Right now, the staff are very proud of the unique role they
play at the Marion prison,'' he said. ``It will be a change; it
will take some adjustment.''
   Colorado residents are undaunted by the prospect of living near
the most violent federal criminals. Fremont County, about 120 miles
south of Denver, welcomed the complex with $130,000 in incentives,
said County Commission member Bud Chess.
   The county already is home to seven state prisons, Chess said.
   ``To the people here, it's just part of life. When you move
something like that into an area where the people haven't been
around prisoners, they are all shook up,'' Chess said from his
office in the county seat of Canon City.
   The $160 million Florence prison complex will house 1,960
prisoners in security levels ranging from minimum to maximum, said
Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesman Scott Burton in Washington, D.C.
   Clark estimated that the new prison will have about 500 beds for
level six inmates. Burton said it would require a total of 650 to
750 staff members, including an undetermined number of guards.
   A decision is pending on whether some of the most infamous
Marion inmates _ including spies Jonathan Pollard and John Walker
Jr., Colombian drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas and escape artist
Garrett Brock Trapnell _ will be among those transferred, officials
said.
   Those inmates are among seven who live in Marion's K-Unit,
reserved for the most notorious prisoners, which one prison
official said takes ``nearly an act of Congress'' for visitors to
gain access to.
   When Marion is changed to level five, it will have enlarged
recreation areas, a central education area, more classrooms and
psychologists' rooms and an expanded library, Clark said. ``There
are large parts of the institution that aren't used much or aren't
used at all,'' he said.

   A few of the people who own homes in the Mud Lake area near Pine
Bluff, Ark., have been boating through the treetops and rooftops.
   ``Was the driveway rough?'' W.H. ``Buddy'' Clark joked as his
visitors glided to a stop, their boat almost even with the windows
of his garage.
   Clark and his wife, Eula, park their boat on a levee and go into
town to get ice and groceries. They cook on a borrowed camp stove.
They have no utilities other than water so they motor over to a
neighbor's house to watch the evening news.
   ``If it wasn't so bad, it would almost be fun,'' Mrs. Clark
said. ``Last night was a beautiful sunset. That helped.''

   North of Little Rock, State Rep. Lloyd George, D-Danville, had

``Obviously, that's not enough for them to feed on,'' he said.
   The cows are hemmed in on three sides by water and by a
neighbor's fence on the fourth side.
   It's costing him $100 a day to feed the cattle that otherwise
would graze, George said.
   ``I'm concerned about these cattle _ if I have to keep feeding
them it gets expensive,'' said George.
   He went on to counter some critics who say the situation has

   The only way they could manage to get the cattle onto boats was

   Traffic jams and landfills have come to
Mount Everest, the roof of the world.
   A growing number of nature lovers, and the flags, clothes and
oxygen tanks they leave behind, are turning parts of the majestic
mountain into a garbage dump. And a crowded one at that.
   A long line of climbers snaked near Everest's peak Thursday,
vying for elbow room on the top. Americans, New Zealanders, Swiss,
Soviets, Chinese and Australians queued up to reach the 29,028-foot
summit.
   One was the son of Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person to reach
the summit. Hillary has expressed concern about damage to the
fragile ecology of the Himalayas.
   At least 17 people reached the crowded summit over the course of
the day. Some came within minutes of each other. One group came
from the north side, but the others hiked from the southeast,
taking the traditional route made famous by Hillary, the New
Zealander who first conquered Everest with his Nepalese guide,
Tenzing Norgay, on May 29, 1953.
   Fortunately, Thursday's climbers did not all reach the summit at
once. Everest's pointy peak has room for only about 10 hikers _
backpacks and oxygen gear included.
   It has been one of the mountain's busiest seasons.
   A Japanese team of three even tried to fly over Everest, in the
first attempt to buzz the peak in a hot air balloon. They crashed
Wednesday and one man suffered leg injuries.
   In late April, the Nepalese Tourist Administration said more
than 100 people were climbing the mountain from the Nepalese side.
Add to that a group of 30 climbers from a ``peace group'' of
Soviets, Chinese and Americans, who attacked the mountain from
Tibet.
   This mountainous traffic jam raises questions about the effects
such hikes have on the ecology of Everest and the pristine
Himalayas. The mountain range, famed for its breathtaking views,
pure air and fertile valleys, is being ravaged by deforestation.
   Population increases in the Himalayan valleys have led farmers
to cut down local forests for fuel and housing. Maneka Gandhi,
India's minister of state for environment, warns that deforestation
will have disastrous results far beyond the highlands. Already, it
contributes to flooding in Bangladesh and erosion in the Indian
plains.
   Everest itself has been turned into a dump in some places _
littered with mountaineers' used oxygen tanks, metal food
containers, flags and clothes. Climbers estimate that two tons of
garbage despoil Everest's majestic flanks.
   Since this year's season began, the first to reach to peak were
Nepalese soldiers. On April 24, five of 25 soldiers scaled
Everest's heights. Then three assaults from the ``peace group''
expedition made it to the top.
   Among the pack Thursday was Hillary's 36-year-old son, Peter. He
reached the summit at 7:30 a.m., with two other members of an
eight-member team from New Zealand along with a Nepalese sherpa
guide.
   Even at that early hour, which necessitated setting out from the
26,197-foot high Camp 4 an hour before midnight Wednesday, Hillary
still wasn't the first.
   Five Americans had already arrived at the peak with two sherpas.
The climbers were Peter George Alhams, 32, of Snow Bird, Utah; Dana
Quentin Coffield, 31, of Columbia, S.C.; Glenn Porzak, 41, of
Boulder, Colo.; Michael Browning, 37, of Monitou Spring, Colo.; and
Brent Manning, 39, of Salt Lake City.
   Later in the day, six climbers from the joint
American-Chinese-Soviet team scaled Everest, bringing to 20 the
number from the ``peace group'' to reach the summit.
   Two more teams were waiting in the wings. Three Belgians turned
back when the regulator of an oxygen cylinder burst.
   Only one expedition in the recent season set out with the
express idea of cleaning the mountain. The ``peace group'' will be
filling up duffle bags to be buried in a landfill near the
mountain's base camp.
   Jim Whittaker, a top American mountaineer who is overseeing the
international trip, has focused attention on the garbage problem.
Whittaker was the first American to climb Everest in 1963.
   Edmund Hillary has also spoken out against the destruction of
the Himalayan range. In a news conference in March in New Delhi,
Hillary, now 70, said tourist development has destroyed much of the
beauty of the Himalayas.
   ``The living standards are increasing, but the beautiful tracks
and valleys have been littered and the forests destroyed,'' he said.
   Indeed, trekking traffic in the Himalayas has skyrocketed in the
past decade, fueled by the desire by many Westerners for exotic
vacations.
   The jam on Everest also has increased. Since Hillary first
scaled its peak, Everest has been conquered about 240 times,
sometimes by the same person. About 100 people have died making the
attempt.
   The going price for an expedition ranges from $50,000 to
$300,000, depending on its size. Each sherpa makes about $300 to
$500 per climb.

<HEAD>Poles Face New Shortage: Lack of Passports</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poles once blamed the Communists for
shortages of everything from meat to gasoline, but their newly won
freedoms have produced a unique supply problem _ too few passports
to meet the demand.
   Now that regulations have been loosened to allow Poles to travel
freely abroad, there has been a rush to apply for passports, which
people can now keep at home.
   This has resulted in a shortage of the passport documents
themselves, according to media reports.
   A personnel shortage also has lengthened the waiting time for
passports, the pro-Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza reported this
week. Sometimes the wait is even longer than it took to obtain a
passport when the Communists were still in power.
   A meeting at the Interior Ministry on Tuesday failed to solve
the problem. The document shortage is blamed on the state mint,
which prints passports, the newspaper said.
   ``While the holiday season is approaching, the lack of passports
continues. The Interior Ministry did not promise any rapid
improvement,'' Gazeta Wyborcza said.
   Negotiations are under way with a Swiss firm to produce the
travel documents, but the $22 million price tag may prove too high
for the financially strapped government, the newspaper said.
   In one Warsaw district, the wait for a passport now exceeds two
months and the situation is similar across Poland, Gazeta Wyborcza
said.
   The issuance of passports is to be transferred from the Interior
Ministry, which controls the police and security forces, to the
civil administration under reforms pending in parliament.
   But that shift, which will take three months from the time the
law is enacted, is not expected to solve the shortage, the
newspaper said.
   After martial law was lifted in 1983, Communist authorities
gradually eased restrictions on travel abroad, and in many cases
Poles were able to receive a passport within several weeks of
filing their application.
   In early 1989, the then-Communist government lifted a regulation
requiring Poles to surrender their passport to police after every
trip abroad and then reapply for the document when they wanted to
travel again.
   Instead, Poles were allowed to keep their passport at home, and
the document remained valid for an unlimited number of trips abroad
for up to 10 years.
   The Solidarity-led government, which came to power in August,
has further eased travel regulations.
   The biggest problem now for Poles wanting to travel West is
obtaining a visa. Poles face long lines and must undergo a careful
screening process in order to obtain visas for such popular
destinations as Britain and the United States.

   A man who wanted to do right by a waitress
took things too far, police said, robbing a bank to come up with
her tip.
   The man, whom police described as a shirtless transient, became
concerned when he went to pay the $4 bill for his lunch at the
downtown Golden Spike restaurant Wednesday afternoon.
   ``After he ate, he told the waitress, `I don't have enough money
for a tip, but I'm going to go rob a bank and I'll be back,''' said
Dolores Steggell, supervisor of the restaurant.
   The man allegedly walked across the street to First Interstate
Bank, told the teller he had a gun and demanded all of the $20s,
said Salt Lake Police Lt. Joel Campbell.
   He fled the bank clutching about $1,200 in his hand and entered
the restaurant, where he gave the waitress a $2 tip, Steggell said.
Before he was able to leave, police arrived, arrested him and
recovered the money _ including the tip.
   John Milton Park, 31, was booked into the Salt Lake County Jail
pending a federal court hearing.

   Oral Roberts University has agreed to pay
$6 million in cash for the PTL satellite network once headed by Jim
and Tammy Faye Bakker, but the ministry's court-appointed trustee
said Thursday the deal is not final.
   The trustee, Columbia attorney Dennis Shedd, said he is still
hoping to sell the network and other PTL assets as a package before
the contract with Oral Roberts is approved by a U.S. bankruptcy
judge.
   Shedd said he signed the pact with the Tulsa, Okla.-based
university founded by evangelist Oral Roberts because he wants to
force action by buyers interested in acquiring the entire PTL
complex.
   He added, however, that he did not yet have such an offer
although ``there are four or five groups that are seriously looking
at'' the whole package. Shedd declined to identify them.
   ``I do have a firm deal with Oral Roberts University. However,
in the contract, I expressly reserved the right to sell all the
assets until the point of approval of the sale of just the
network,'' Shedd said in a telephone interview.
   The complex includes the satellite network, the 500-acre
Heritage USA Christian retreat in Fort Mill and 1,700 acres of
undeveloped land in upstate South Carolina.
   Shedd said he made the deal ``because I have a cash offer and I
think it makes good business sense to sell this asset. This asset
is essentially deteriorating. ... Plus, it also works into the
broader scheme to sell the whole property.''
   Shedd filed legal papers in Columbia Thursday asking U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Thurmond Bishop to approve the sale to Roberts on
May 31 _ in effect the deadline for prospective bidders to submit
offers for the entire package.
   The actual contract signing, which was done by fax machine and
air express service between Tulsa and Columbia, was completed
Wednesday and included a $1 million down payment.
   ``I plan to sell it one way or the other and this is the only
firm offer I have for any substantial part of the estate,'' Shedd
said.
   Richard Roberts, son of the 72-year-old faith-healer, said
university regents approved the offer this week.
   ``We believe it is important to provide 24-hour Christian
broadcasting to a global audience assuring that God's word will be
taken to every man's world,'' Roberts said in a statement.
   Roberts told the Tulsa World the agreement was reached about two
weeks ago but that ministry officials needed seven days to raise
the money for the down payment.
   ``We were able to raise the $1 million from our regents and from
several of our very dear prayer partners,'' Roberts told the
newspaper.
   The assets of the Bakkers' former religious broadcasting empire
have been on the block since April 1988, a year after Jim Bakker
resigned in a sex-and-money scandal.
   Bakker was convicted last fall of fraudulently raising $158
million from PTL contributors and is serving a 45-year prison
sentence in a federal prison in Minnesota.
   The Heritage USA retreat has been shut since September, when
Canadian businessman Stephen Mernick failed to close on his
contract to buy the assets for $65 million.
   The broadcast network, however, continues to operate with a
skeleton staff of about 10 employees. It broadcasts shows produced
by other evangelists such as Jerry Falwell, James Robison and
Roberts' son, Richard.
   As for the network's future, Shedd told The Charlotte (N.C.)
Observer, ``My understanding is they want to operate it as a
religious network.''
   The contract gives Roberts all the network's satellite and cable
leases and all of PTL's television production equipment, which will
be moved to Tulsa.
   Shedd said Roberts has already given him a $1 million deposit,
which will be refunded if all PTL's assets are sold as a package to
another buyer.
   The remaining $5 million is due in cash at the closing, which is
to come 10 days after Federal Communications Commission approval
transferring the broadcasting license, The Observer reported.
   ``I think it's a good price,'' Shedd said.
   At the time PTL declared bankruptcy in June 1987, the satellite
network was carried on 1,300 cable systems that had 12 million
subscribers.
   According to court papers filed Thursday, that has slipped to
800 systems with 6.4 million subscribers, The Observer reported.
   Besides PTL, there are only four other religious satellite
networks in the United States: Pat Robertson's Christian
Broadcasting Network (CBN), the Southern Baptist Convention's ACTS
network, Paul Crouch's Trinity Network and Jimmy Allen's LIFE TV.
   Other evangelists such as Roberts buy time on those four
networks.

   A joint U.S.-Vietnamese team has
excavated warplane crash sites in central Vietnam to search for the
remains of about 12 missing American airmen, the official Vietnam
News Agency reported.
   The report, dated Thursday and seen in Bangkok today, did not
say if anything was recovered from the search in Quang Tri and
Quang Binh. The 21-day project ended Thursday.
   It was the 10th time Vietnamese and U.S. specialists have
conducted joint field searches for remains of a total of about
2,300 American servicemen listed as missing in action, or MIA, from
the Vietnam War.
   The war ended 15 years ago in a Communist North Vietnamese
victory over the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government, and many
Vietnamese and American experts believe many of the remains will
never be found.
   The U.S. government has said progress on the MIA search will
determine the pace of efforts to establish diplomatic relations
between the United States and Vietnam. The major barrier is
Washington's demand for a political settlement of the war in
Cambodia, which Vietnamese soldiers invaded in 1978.

notorious sibling.
   But convicted cop slapper Zsa Zsa also has suffered an

   Actually, it was Eva who appeared in the series with a pig named

``Return to Green Acres.''
   ``Why should we be linked together, dahlink? That annoys the

   ``But I don't necessarily approve of certain things she does,
nor does she of what I do. I just think it's so unfair, and I

   Eight vehicles belonging to comedian Redd Foxx
were going on the auction block today to help pay the $2.9 million
the Internal Revenue Service claims he owes in back taxes.
   The vehicles, including a 1927 Model T Ford, were seized during
a November 1989 raid at Foxx's Las Vegas home.
   Lawyers for Foxx agreed that the vehicles could be auctioned
with some other items belonging to Foxx if the comedian could keep
his home and other personal effects.
   Foxx's lawyer, Marc Risman, said the deal allows the IRS to
attach part of Foxx's earnings from his show at the Hacienda Hotel
in Las Vegas. ``He's paying back what he can afford to pay back at
this time,'' Risman said. ``He gets a reasonable amount to live off
of.''

   Jane Pauley says she left NBC's ``Today'' show,
where she was co-host for 13 years, because the job was in conflict
with her family life.
   ``NBC was very serious about keeping me,'' Pauley told USA
Weekend in this week's issue. ``We were in a mutual state of
disbelief. They did not believe I was serious.''
   Pauley, who left the morning show five months ago, has exchanged
pre-dawn rising for daytime duties at NBC that include substituting
for Tom Brokaw on the evening news for three weeks starting May 23.
   She says she is a less-stressed mother to her three children,
6-year-old twins Ross and Rachel and 3-year-old Thomas.
   ``They're getting a more relaxed bedtime routine,'' says Pauley.
``I'm more likely to linger over a bedtime story because I'm less
anxious to get to bed myself.''
   In the old days, she would rise at 3 a.m., get to the office by
5:30 a.m., spend afternoons at home preparing for the next day's
show and be in bed by 8 p.m. Now she can breakfast with her kids
and at night there's no homework to worry about.

   The tipoff was the story the other day that
President Bush is willing to halt production of U.S. chemical
weapons.
   The president is aiming for an agreement with Moscow _ provided
he gets it on his terms _ to sharply reduce U.S. and Soviet
stockpiles of poison gas.
   But the reason Bush is making the move now is that other arms
control accords are proving to be elusive as the May 30-June 3
summit approaches.
   And Bush wants to be able to do some serious business with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to go along with five days of
photo opportunities. Otherwise the two leaders could be accused of
unproductive posturing.
   Months ago, when the summit was scheduled, it looked like an
agreement could be ready to reduce long-range nuclear missiles,
bombers and submarines.
   Only wild optimists expected a finished treaty for Bush and
Gorbachev to sign. The issues are complex. Besides, any
verification system to make sure there is no cheating requires an
enormous amount of work _ and trust.
   But considering the Soviet leader's determination to cut nuclear
arms and Bush's positive response after an initial delay, the plan
was to celebrate the summit with a strategic arms
agreement-in-principle on key issues.
   Bush and Gorbachev would initial the framework accord, and up to
50 percent of the most dangerous weapons in the world would be
consigned to the scrap heap after U.S. and Soviet negotiators in
Geneva worked out the details.
   But with Gorbachev due here in less than three weeks, the two
sides are still far apart.
   For example: they have agreed tentatively to eliminate
land-based ballistic missiles with multiple warheads. But the
Soviets want to extend the ban to such missiles carried by
submarines. That is an area of U.S. strength, and the
administration is balking.
   The Soviets also want to make deeper cuts in air-launched cruise
missiles than the administration is willing to accept. The reason
is the Pentagon plans a new missile above the cutoff range proposed
by Moscow.
   Negotiations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the Warsaw Pact have also slowed in Vienna on another treaty to
reduce troops, tanks and other non-nuclear arms in Europe.
   The plan was to have the heads of 35 countries, including Bush
and Gorbachev, sign the treaty at a European summit before the end
of the year. There is still some hope of reaching that goal.
   But Bush's prediction last June that the treaty would be ready
by now is falling flat, so he and Gorbachev are unable to announce
that the major arms control accord is at the wrap-up stage.
   The picture could change when Secretary of State James A. Baker
III holds talks in Moscow next week with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, although they failed to make serious
headway only last week in Bonn.
   Thus, a chemical weapons accord looms as the most promising
candidate for the Bush-Gorbachev summit, though it is not a cinch
either.
   Bush wants the Soviets to agree that the two sides should retain
small stockpiles of chemical weapons until all 40 nations sign and
implement a global ban.
   The Soviets have resisted until now. Some two dozen nations are
believed either to possess or be capable of manufacturing poison
gas.
   The Soviet argument is that waiting for all 40 nations to carry
out the treaty before scrapping the last U.S. and Soviet chemical
weapons would indefinitely postpone ridding the world of poison gas.
   Still, the president's move this week probably is based on a
judgment that enough is settled for him and Gorbachev to assure the
people of the world that in one dangerous arena there may be cause
for hope and that the United States and the Soviet Union will lead
the way.

<HEAD>Cheney: Fewer Nuclear Weapons Ahead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO nations will have fewer nuclear weapons
on their soil as a result of an alliance review of its future
nuclear strategy needs, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney predicts.
   Cheney, speaking with reporters after a two-day NATO meeting in
Western Canada, also left the door open for a unilateral alliance
move to withdraw aged nuclear artillery shells from Western Europe.
   ``It's entirely possible,'' Cheney said. ``It wouldn't be the
first time it's been done.''
   The defense secretary said the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization clearly is in the mood to pare its nuclear arsenal in
light of the near-evaporation of the Warsaw Pact, prospects for
Soviet troops withdrawals from Eastern Europe and East-West
agreements to slash conventional forces.
   Given those developments, ``you can also take down nuclear
forces,'' Cheney told reporters aboard his plane returning to
Washington.
   ``We want to go to the lowest level (of nuclear weapons) we can
... we don't want any more nuclear weapons than necessary,'' he
said.
   The meeting was the first alliance discussion of nuclear issues
after President Bush announced he had dropped plans to upgrade
short-range nuclear Lance missiles and was scrapping a move to
modernize nuclear artillery.
   At the conference, Dutch and West German officials pressed for
speedy, unilateral elimination of the 1,600 nuclear-tipped
artillery shells. The weapons are designed to be used within a
10-to 20-mile range to halt an overwhelming advance of Warsaw Pact
troops.
   Britain expressed reservations about the idea and called for
holding onto some short-range, land-based nuclear weapons.
   But the United States did not object to the Dutch and German
proposal, which was supported by other ministers, leaving it for
further study under a lengthy review of NATO nuclear strategy.
   Cheney said the comprehensive review of NATO's nuclear force
structure wouldn't be anywhere near completed by the time alliance
leaders gather for a summit in London July 5-6.
   He said the review ``is going to take a long time'' but believed
it ``would result in an overall reduction in nuclear weapons.''
   ``We're likely to see fewer nuclear weapons in Europe than in
the past,'' he said.
   Cheney appeared upbeat about the results of his third NATO
Nuclear Planning Group session, which was held at the snowy
Kananaskis ski resort at the foot of the Canadian Rockies.
   Fourteen of the alliance's 16 defense ministers _ including an
observer from Iceland _ ended the session with a statement that
there is a ``diminishing need'' for short-range nuclear systems in
the alliance arsenal amid the changing security situation in Europe.
   The ministers left to a future series of NATO sessions decisions
on what kind of cuts might be made in those short-range nuclear
systems and how deep they might go.
   Cheney stressed that some U.S. nuclear weapons must remain in
Europe as a fundamental deterrent and as a means of avoiding war.
   Conventional forces alone won't prevent an outbreak of war, he
argued.
   He described as ``very, very shaky thinking'' the view that
Europe can rid itself of nuclear weapons when NATO and the Warsaw
Pact reach parity in conventional forces.
   ``Everybody wants to operate as though the future is here
today,'' he said, repeating his oft-stated warning that although
changes in Soviet military posture in Europe have begun, they are
by no means complete.
   The short-range forces under discussion have come to prominence
in light of the U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating intermediate-range
nuclear missiles, which had a range of more than 300 miles.
   The alliance, in its statement, acknowledged that the decision
to cut back on shorter-range weapons places more emphasis on
air-launched nuclear missiles, which also must be upgraded in the
coming decade.
   But NATO members made no decision on the weapons, studiously
avoiding entering any kind of debate such as the one that split the
alliance over the upgrade of the Lance systems.
   The Lance was deemed irrelevant in light of prospects for German
unification, given that it was designed for use against East
Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   The upgraded Lance could reach into the Soviet Union, and some
in West Germany opposed adding a more powerful weapon to their
stockpile amid lessening tensions.

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Calls For Deposit Insurance Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is
outlining ideas for overhauling the bank deposit insurance system
but is stopping well short of advocating a substantial cutback in
the 56-year-old program.
   In his first extensive remarks on the subject, Greenspan on
Thursday suggested:
   _Varying insurance premiums according to the riskiness of a
bank's investments.
   _Examining banks' books more frequently.
   _Seizing weak banks faster.
   _Requiring bank owners to risk more of their own money.
   Federal deposit insurance began in 1934 after the nation
suffered an unprecedented wave of bank runs and failures during the
Depression. However, it has been blamed for skewing incentives in
the financial system and helping create the savings and loan crisis.
   All banks now pay the same deposit insurance premium. Current
law in most cases bars the takeover of banks until they officially
are insolvent, but by that time losses to the federal deposit
insurance fund sometimes are steep.
   Greenspan, in a speech in Chicago, did not address proposals on
cutting back $100,000 per account insurance, limiting insurance to
one account, imposing ``deductibles'' on insurance or finding a way
to let large banks fail without endangering the system.
   ``He is proceeding gingerly ... but in the chairman are the
seeds of a most radical reform of our existing financial system,''
said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the
Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents
smaller banks wary of deposit insurance changes.
   The Treasury Department is due to release its banking reform
plan by next February. Greenspan is expected to be a major
influence in its development and in congressional debate on the
issue next year.
   The Treasury study, at Greenspan's insistence, was required by
last year's legislation on bailing out the nation's troubled
savings and loans.
   Greenspan appeared to reject the notion of simply abolishing
deposit insurance and other safeguards, which some free-market
conservatives advocate.
   ``The United States has not suffered a financial panic or
systemic bank run in the last 50 years. In large part this reflects
the safety net,'' he said.
   But protection comes at a cost, he said. The three-part safety
net poses a ``moral hazard'' for bankers by allowing them to shift
some of the risks of their actions onto the public.
   The three areas are deposit insurance, the ability of banks to
borrow at low rates in emergencies from the Fed's discount window
and banks' access the Fed's electronic payments wire, which
guarantees payments between banks.
   Reform of the safety net should be considered in tandem with
permitting banks to expand into securities and insurance, Greenspan
said.
   Offering banks no new powers likely would cause commercial
banking to shrink, shifting money to unprotected parts of the
financial system. That, in turn, ``may create systemic risk similar
to that faced in earlier years,'' he said.
   Some have advocated strict ``fire walls'' separating new
activities from an insured bank. But Greenspan said that
``undercuts the reason for granting any additional powers to
banking organizations in the first place.''
   Instead ``we should probably develop additional
market-simulating ways of limiting moral hazard,'' he said.
   ``We might also consider the desirability of returning to
capital requirements that more closely simulate those that the
market dictated in a world without a safety net,'' he said.
   Bank owners currently risk about six cents of every dollar they
lend. Greenspan noted that in the 1800s, before the creation of
deposit insurance and the discount window, bankers risked 25 cents
to 50 cents for every dollar loaned. That encouraged them to use
more caution, he said.

<TEXT>
   Anthony Hope, a lawyer and son of entertainer
Bob Hope, is expected to be confirmed quickly as chairman of a new
federal Indian gaming commission.
   The law that created the commission 18 months ago to watch over
gambling on Indian reservations requires two of its three members
to be Indians.
   ``Mr. Hope is not an Indian, but is an Indian at heart,'' Sen.
Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said Thursday at a hearing at which Hope's
management skills were praised.
   Inouye said he would bring the nomination to a committee vote
Monday and hoped to get it approved on the Senate floor before
Memorial Day.
   Leonard Prescott, vice chairman of the National Indian Gaming
Association said a number of tribal governments and Indian
organizations had expressed concerns about Hope's inexperience in
Indian affairs and gaming.
   ``However, we believe that his extensive management and
financial background will be beneficial to the work of the
commission,'' Prescott said.
   Hope, 49, said he grew up in the West and was familiar with the
conditions on reservations.
   ``Although I am not an Indian, my personal and professional
background make me empathetic to the condition of the Indians and
capable of managing a small regulatory agency,'' he said.
   A graduate of Georgetown University and Harvard Law School, Hope
worked in New Hampshire for George Bush's presidential campaigns in
1980 and 1988. He was on President Reagan's Grace Commission, which
made recommendations on cutting government waste.
   Hope also was a partner in the accounting firm of Touche Ross &amp;
Co., and formerly worked for Mutual of Omaha. He ran unsuccessfully
for Congress from California in 1986.
   The three-year commission chairmanship pays $83,600 a year.
   About 100 tribes use bingo or other forms of gambling to raise
money.
   Incidents such as recent riots near the Mohawk lands in St.
Regis, N.Y., and the vulnerability of the reservations to organized
crime have demonstrated the need for more supervision, officials
have said.
   Inouye said the commission would inspect gambling premises, do
background checks on employees, levy fines and enforce ordinances.

   A Yugoslav cruiser with 240 Italian
tourists on board returned from Albania after becoming the first
tour boat in recent history to dock in the isolated Communist
nation, the Yugoslav news agency said.
   The Yugoslav cruiser, Dalmacija, has since returned to the port
of Split, the Tanjug agency said Thursday without further detail.
   Yugoslavia and Albania have extremely limited cross-border trade
and freighters sometimes dock on the Albanian coast.
   Albania signaled this week in advance of a visit by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that it intends to open
up further to the outside world.
   Senior Communist Party officials have reportedly told Parliament
that in the future Albanians will be granted passports for travel
and the death penalty will be dropped for those trying to flee
across the country's tightly sealed borders.
   Penalties for those spreading ``religious propaganda'' will also
be dropped, the officials said.
   Albania, a country of 3.1 million residents, is wedged between
Yugoslavia and Greece.

   The coordinator of the government's war on
drugs says he will not change strategy despite a Senate study that
sets the number of hard-core cocaine addicts in the United States
at 2.2 million, more than double the administration's estimate.
   National drug policy director William J. Bennett angrily
rejected suggestions by a Senate committee chairman Thursday that
the administration's focus on discouraging casual use of cocaine
should be changed to give more attention to hard-core addicts.
   The addiction statistics in the Judiciary Committee report
contrast with an estimate by the government's National Institute of
Drug Abuse that there are 862,000 hard-core addicts, defined as
individuals who use cocaine at least once a week.
   The report and the criticism by committee Chairman Joseph R.
Biden Jr., D-Del., touched off a day of feuding between Biden and
Bennett, who said the senator was seeking ammunition for
congressional election campaigns this fall.
   ``This is ridiculous,'' Bennett said in a telephone interview.
``What official estimate is he talking about? There is no official
estimate. In the national drug control strategy we use a number
larger than the one he is using. We use 4 million'' drug addicts.
   ``I think I know why he is doing it, though,'' Bennett added.
``What is it now, May? It's not that long until November. It's that
time of year, the political time of year.''
   The feud resumed Thursday night when Biden and Bennett met on
the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour on the Public Broadcasting System.
   Bennett told Biden sharply that ``you are trying to discredit
our policy'' and ``we think this is just a bit disingenuous.''
   ``I don't like this rhetoric, Bill,'' Biden shot back. ``I don't
like these cheap shots about being disingenuous.''
   While Bennett clung to the national drug strategy's figure of 4
million addicts, Biden pointed out that it referred to users of all
kinds of drugs, not just cocaine. Bennett retorted that most
addicts abuse more than one drug. Both men conceded, however, that
there was no way of getting a perfectly accurate count.
   Dr. Edgar Adams of the National Institute of Drug Abuse told
reporters at Biden's news conference that the Senate report was ``a
good attempt to look at what was a very complex problem.''
   He praised the report because ``it restates the fact that drug
abuse is a very serious problem.'' But he said there was a 95
percent confidence level for the institute's smaller estimate and
cautioned it might be hard to arrive at anything similar for the
Senate version.
   The Senate report put the number of hard-core addicts nationwide
at 2,159,000 and said nearly one in every 100 Americans is a weekly
cocaine user.
   Some areas of the United States have ``extraordinarily high
concentrations'' of addicts, according to the report. It said one
out of every 40 individuals in New York state uses cocaine at least
once a week.
   The nation's capital had the highest per capita rate, 32.9
hard-core users among every 1,000 Washington, D.C., residents, the
report said.
   The report was prepared under the supervision of Mark A.R.
Kleiman of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
   Biden said the results of the survey were ``tragic'' and urged a
$3 billion drug-fighting plan ranging from research and development
of new treatments to doubling law enforcement grants to $900
million.
   ``Our consciences demand that we act, our pocketbooks command
that we do so and our safety demands that it be done immediately,''
Biden said.
   The report said only one out of 10 hard-core addicts receives
drug treatment and that most who are arrested quickly return to the
streets.
   The report estimated that New York state had the most hard-core
addicts, 434,000, followed by California, 325,000; Texas, 144,000;
Illinois, 142,000; and Florida, 93,000.

<HEAD>Cristiani: U.S. Lawmakers Interfering In Salvadoran Justice</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Cristiani
says U.S. lawmakers are interfering with Salvadoran justice by
saying the investigation into the killings of six Jesuit priests
has ground to a halt.
   A panel of House Democrats, headed by Joe Moakley of
Massachusetts, reported April 30 that the investigation into the
Jesuit killings had reached ``a virtual standstill.''
   Cristiani said Thursday that a U.S. congressional report
``gathered up speculations and sometimes tries to present them as
facts. And this makes things difficult because it obstructs the
judicial process.''
   The American congressmen ``can say it bogged down. But the truth
is that it did not bog down. The case continues to be worked on,''
Cristiani said.
   The House report, based on an investigation that lasted months
and included a visit to El Salvador, said authorities were making
little effort to determine if senior officers ordered the crime or
covered it up.
   The six Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daughter were shot to
death by uniformed soldiers on the night of Nov. 16 at their home
on the Central American University campus in San Salvador.
   The assassinations took place in the middle of a month-long
offensive by leftist rebels, and the area was under military
control with a dusk-to-dawn curfew.
   Col. Guillermo Benavides, three lieutenants and four soldiers
have been arrested and charged with murdering the eight people. A
ninth soldier, a private, is a fugitive.
   Cristiani spoke shortly after Col. Inocento Montano, deputy
minister of public security, told reporters he thought Benavides
was innocent.
   Pretrial testimony showed the soldiers left the Military School,
which Benavides directed at the time, on the night of the murders.
   Four cadets, who were on guard duty at the time, were summoned
twice by Judge Ricardo Zamora to testify but failed to appear.
Three were sent on a study mission to Fort Benning, Ga., and the
fourth to Panama.
   U.S. officials Thursday said the three cadets at Fort Benning's
School of the Americas, where many of El Salvador's third-year
cadets receive training, were sent back to San Salvador.
   The school's commandant, Col. William DePalo Jr., said the three
were sent home Wednesday to testify in the case.
   The army said the guard logbook at the Salvadoran military
school disappeared, and Benavides said he never kept a personal
diary that soldiers of his rank are supposed to keep.
   Zamora said Tuesday two other officers summoned to testify have
also not appeared.
   The only evidence against Benavides is testimony from other
suspects, and under Salvadoran law such testimony is not valid.
Zamora has said there may not be enough evidence to send the case
to a jury.
   At least one retired officer said publicly Benavides acted under
orders from high officials to assassinate the Jesuits.
Pro-government newspapers had accused the Jesuits of being leftist
sympathizers.
   More than 72,000 people have been killed since leftist
guerrillas launched their insurgency a decade ago. Most of the
victims were civilians suspected of left-wing sympathies, slain by
rightist death squads with links to the military.

<HEAD>Researchers See New Microorganism as Possible Helper to AIDS Virus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A microbe that is a common contaminant in
laboratories may be an infectious agent that contributes to the
lethal effects of the AIDS virus.
   The organism, called mycoplasma, was discovered four years ago
by Shyh-Ching Lo, but is only now being considered seriously by
AIDS investigators, according to an article published today in the
journal Science.
   Lo, a virologist at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology
here, said in a telephone interview that his work was ignored until
he presented his work last December and March at special workshops.
   Some of the world's leading experts on mycoplasmas attended the
workshops and at least four labs now are trying to confirm Lo's
work.
   Lo reported that in five years of study he has isolated a
specific mycoplasma from the heart, kidneys, brain, spleen and
liver of AIDS patients. He said the microbe, which he calls
mycoplasma incognitus, is a new species that may also be able to
independently cause disease.
   Dr. John Bartlett of Johns Hopkins University, who sponsored Lo
at the March workshop, said the findings are ``intriguing'' but
that the research needs to be verified in other laboratories before
it can be accepted widely.
   ``Whenever a researcher finds mycoplasmas, the medical community
tends to be skeptical,'' said Bartlett. Mycoplasmas frequently are
found as contaminants in microbiological experiments, he said.
   ``I'm not convinced it is a cause of disease, but it needs
further study,'' Bartlett said of Lo's study. Other researchers
agreed.
   Lo first reported discovery of his mycoplasma in 1986, but the
findings met with ridicule in the research community. Lo now
acknowledges there was reason for skepticism. ``The data were not
very conclusive,'' he said.
   Lo continued to work, however, and last year the American
Journal of Tropical Medicine published his first paper on
mycoplasmas. It captured new interest, he said.
   ``When we presented this work before, it wasn't understood,''
said Lo. ``Now they have started a lot of work looking into it.''
   The findings were strong enough for the government's National
Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases to convene a
workshop last December in San Antonio and allow Lo to present his
studies to some of the nation's top microbiologists.
   Dr. Joel B. Baseman, a microbiologist at the University of Texas
Health Science Center in San Antonio and chairman of the December
workshop, said Lo's studies stood up to close scrutiny from experts
in the field. He said many went away convinced that Lo had found
enough evidence of a new infectious agent that further study was
justified.
   But just what role, if any, the mycoplasma plays in AIDS is not
known.
   ``It's not absolutely clear what it is doing in AIDS-related
disease, but it appears to be present in many cases and seems to
the sole source of pathology in specific tissues,'' said Baseman.
``The evidence is reasonable.''
   Science, the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, reported that Luc Montagnier, a prominent
French researcher and the co-discoverer of the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, believed to cause AIDS, also has
studied a mycoplasma in AIDS patients.
   Montagnier has speculated that a mycoplasma is an AIDS virus
co-factor, which means it works with HIV to cause disease.
   A mycoplasma is neither a virus or a bacteria. It has no cell
wall, but it contains genetic material and reproduces by division,
as does bacteria. Mycoplasmas have been associated with some rare
types of pneumonia and have been isolated in the genital tract of
healthy men and women.
   Baseman said Lo, in his workshop presentation, showed that
although the mycoplasma may play a role in AIDS, it may be a lethal
infection agent all by itself. He said Lo isolated the mycoplasma
in six patients who tested negative for the AIDS virus, but who
died from unspecified causes within seven weeks of becoming ill.
   Four silvered leaf monkeys also died of unspecified disease
within nine months of being injected with the mycoplasma, Science
reported.

   Prosecutors seeking six new drug charges

the mayor, sources familiar with the case say.
   The new charges returned Thursday include five counts of
misdemeanor cocaine possession and a misdemeanor charge of
conspiracy to possess cocaine. They were added to an eight-count
indictment, including three felony perjury counts, filed against
the mayor in February.
   The updated indictment alleges that Barry ``possessed cocaine
and crack with other co-conspirators at more than 20 locations,
including private residences, hotels, government offices and
business establishments and on boats.''
   The charges ``are intended to establish a pattern, a practice of
illegal activity that ranges over a period of years,'' said a law
enforcement source familiar with the case.
   Prosecutors have worried privately that R. Kenneth Mundy,
Barry's attorney, might suggest in court that the mayor was
unfairly lured into drug use on Jan. 18, the night of his arrest in
an FBI sting operation, sources said.
   In order to battle that possible entrapment defense,
investigators have sought to portray Barry as a regular drug user,
said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``These new charges certainly suggest that he (Barry) has done
drugs on an awful lot of occasions over the past five or six
years,'' said one source. ``Was he an occasional or experimental
user? These charges suggest otherwise.''
   The new charges allege that Barry conspired to possess cocaine
and possessed the drug on numerous occasions between the fall of
1984 and his arrest in January.
   Following the arrest, Barry spent seven weeks in rehabilitation
facilities in Florida and South Carolina for treatment of what he
said was alcohol and prescription drug abuse.
   Barry has pleaded innocent to the crimes with which he was
charged in February; Herbert O. Reid Sr., the city's corporation
counsel, predicted the mayor will plead innocent to the new
indictment as well.
   One new charge says Barry possessed cocaine on Sept. 7, 1988,
two days after returning from a secret vacation at a health spa in
the Catskills Mountains of New York state.
   Aides said later that the mayor was receiving dietary counseling
and a variety of health treatments designed to help him lose weight
and reduce his stress level.
   In a statement, U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens spoke of the Barry
investigation as ``ongoing,'' and a source familiar with the effort
said the grand jury will continue hearing evidence.
   Barry refused to comment on his legal status but said his new
troubles with the law will not affect his ability to govern.
   ``I'm not looking for votes,'' he said during an appearance at a
senior citizen's center. ``I'm just being an elected official
trying to do my job and trying to make sure the government goes to
the people.''
   Mundy, Barry's attorney, complained that the charges should not
have been lodged so close to the June 4 scheduled start of the
mayor's trial, but he predicted that the trial would not be
postponed.
   Barry's mayoral term ends this year and he has not yet said
whether he will seek re-election to a fourth four-year term.
However, he has been touring the city and speaking to a wide array
of community groups in campaign-style appearances.
   If convicted of a felony, he would be barred from holding office
or running for re-election once appeals were exhausted.

<TEXT>
   Eighteen months after the mayoral
elections, a judge has confirmed a decision by the elections board
and ruled the pro-commonwealth candidate a winner by 49 votes.
   San Juan Superior Court Judge Carlos Polo issued a 300-page
decision Thursday declaring Hector Luis Acevedo the winner in a
bitter contest against New Progressive Party candidate Jose
Granados Navedo.
   The capital has been a stronghold of the pro-statehood New
Progressive Party since 1968 and Acevedo's victory is seen as a
major blow to the party.
   Acevedo, the candidate of the Popular Democratic Party, has been
occupying the mayor's seat since he was certified the victor by the
State Elections Commission in December 1988 with a 29-vote margin.
   In January 1989, Granados challenged the election results,
claiming irregularities in the vote count. The judge's decision
Thursday was based on a new count of the disputed ballots.
   Carlos Canals, a lawyer representing Granados, said he would
appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico.
   Political parties are aligned according to their support for
either statehood, commonwealth or independence.
   Puerto Rico is a U.S. Commonwealth.

   Volunteers at a soup kitchen figure the
Mother's Day cards they bought for the homeless men and women they
serve a hot lunch to will be the first their mothers have received
in years.
   The cards were being passed out Thursday at the East First
Street Soup Kitchen at Caritas Austin Baptist Chapel. The
volunteers got Austin business to donate the cards, and affixed
stamps with ``LOVE'' on the envelopes.
   Several in the lunch crowd of about 100 said they didn't want to
put a return address on the cards. Some couldn't remember where
their mothers lived.
   ``One young man said he hasn't seen or corresponded with his
mother in six years,'' said Frances Doetsch, a volunteer. ``Don't
you know she's going to be thrilled? I hope she's still alive.''
   Al Alexander picked a card adorned with pink flowers and
addressed it to his mother in Arkansas, whom he hasn't seen in
eight years.
   He wrote: ``I'm going to try to come home soon, and thanks for
the loan.''
   Alexander said he came to Austin in the boom years with dreams
of making it big as a singer, but soon fell on hard times. He may
go home soon. ``I was determined I wasn't going to leave broke, but
...''
   Gerardo Garcia Garea, 14, and his friend, Jesus Jimenez Lara,
17, were eager to get their cards mailed because they were late:
Mother's Day was celebrated in their native Mexico this year on
Thursday.
   Jayzon Wilson said his card was being sent not to his ``real
mom'' but to a woman in Texas ``who takes care of about 10 of us.
We call her Mom.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Considers Civilians to Edit Military Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is seeking an experienced
civilian journalist to edit the Pacific edition of the military
newspaper Stars &amp; Stripes, which ran into charges of censorship and
mismanagement under its military editor.
   Jordan E. Rizer, director of the Defense Department's American
Forces Information Service, said Thursday the agency also will
consider a recommendation by Pentagon-appointed ombudsman Philip M.
Foisie that a civilian editor be named for the European edition.
   Foisie, a former editor with The Washington Post, was named last
summer to make recommendations in light of a study by the
congressional General Accounting Office that found evidence of
censorship and improper management at the government-run daily
paper.
   The Society of Professional Journalists assisted the GAO in its
investigation.
   Stars &amp; Stripes, which was first published during World War I,
is designed to be a ``hometown paper'' for service personnel
stationed abroad.
   Foisie, in a report dated April 20 and released by the Pentagon
on Thursday, said there is an an ``urgent need for vigorous new
hands-on editorial leadership'' of the European edition.
   He recommended ``a senior experienced civilian daily newspaper
editor _ someone not presently on the staff of the European Stars &amp;
Stripes _ be selected as soon as possible.''
   Foisie visited Stuttgart, West Germany, and interviewed members
of the staff. In January, after a similar visit to the Tokyo
offices, he recommended that the military officer with the title of
editor-in-chief of that edition be made publisher and a civilian be
appointed editor.
   Rizer said the American Forces Information Service expect to
advertise next week for applicants for the Tokyo editorship. The
post will be filled through federal civil service procedures.
   Rizer said the former Pacific editor, Col. Ed Montgomery, had
been reassigned and Col. Walter de Forest had been appointed
commander and publisher.
   Regarding the European edition, Rizer said, ``We're taking the
recommendations of the ombudsman under advisement and will try to
react accordingly.''
   In his report on the European edition, Foisie said the new
editor should be named by the Pentagon, the Unified Command in
Stuttgart, and the newspaper's commander and editor-in-chief, Col.
Gene E. Townsend.
   ``There are sharp divisions within the newsroom of the European
edition that require attention, and some editorial reorganization
may also be needed,'' the ombudsman said.

<HEAD>Farmers Headed for Bright Wheat Harvest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are headed for a whopper of a wheat
harvest this year, perhaps enough to boost the nation's depleted
stockpile of bread grain by 70 percent or more.
   The bright outlook is based on the Agriculture Department's
forecast Thursday for winter wheat, which accounts for
three-fourths of the U.S. total.
   As of May 1, surveys showed that 1990 winter wheat production
could be a nine-year high of 2.09 billion bushels, up 44 percent
from last year's harvest of 1.45 billion bushels.
   Average yields were forecast at 41.1 bushels per acre, compared
with 35.1 bushels last year.
   In Kansas, for example, winter wheat production was estimated at
460.2 million bushels, more than double the shriveled 1989 harvest
of 213.6 million bushels. Both the acreage and average yield were
up.
   Overall, farmers are expected to have about 50.8 million acres
of winter wheat for harvest this year, up 23 percent from 41.5
million in 1989, the report said.
   Winter wheat, planted in the fall and harvested the next year,
accounts for about three-fourths of the U.S. total wheat
production. The remainder is planted in the spring.
   Carl Schwensen, executive vice president of the National
Association of Wheat Growers, said the larger harvest will ``put us
in a stock-building mode'' for some time in the future _ at least
until something can be done about worldwide capacity for producing
too much grain.
   Schwensen said the United States has ``made a real
accomplishment'' by putting millions of acres of marginal land in
the Conservation Reserve Program, which takes it out of crop
production for 10 years. He said about 11 million acres of that
land has come from nation's wheat base.
   ``No other major producing and exporting nation has even
attempted to take the initiatives that we've had _ to set aside
marginal lands specifically from wheat production,'' Schwensen said
in a telephone interview.
   In the early and mid-1980s U.S. wheat surpluses grew rapidly,
rising to a peak carryover of 1.9 billion bushels on June 1, 1985.
   Schwensen said he doesn't see that happening again soon, ``but
we are going to be getting up to a billion (bushels), I would
think, over the next couple of seasons.''
   Ideally, he said, the association would like to see year-end
U.S. wheat stockpiles maintained at around 800 million bushels,
although some others, including USDA experts, say a billion bushels
would be all right.
   However, Schwensen said much depends on how the Soviet Union and
China continue to perform as wheat markets, and on the way the U.S.
export subsidy program shapes up in the 1990 farm bill.
   The USDA's first official estimate of 1990 production of all
wheat will be issued July 12, with the first estimates for corn,
soybeans and some other major spring-planted crops scheduled for
Aug. 9, along with revised figures for wheat.
   Although no official estimates based on field surveys were
included, except for winter wheat, department analysts in a related
supply-and-demand report did project ``highly tentative'' 1990
production of all wheat at more than 2.69 billion bushels, up from
less than 2.04 billion last year.
   Projections for all wheat and some other crops were based on
yield trends and an assumption the crop would have normal weather
the remainder of the growing season.
   The 1990 corn harvest was projected at 8.1 billion bushels, up
from 7.53 billion harvested last year. Soybean production was
projected at 1.925 billion bushels, virtually the same as the crop
of 1.927 billion bushels in 1989.
   According to the supply-and-demand report, the U.S. wheat
stockpile will be drained to a 15-year low of 442 million bushels
June 1, the beginning of the new wheat marketing year.
   But with the expected larger 1990 harvest, the wheat stockpile
could be rebuilt to about 765 million bushels a year from now. That
would be close to the 800 million bushels Schwensen and the wheat
growers say is desirable.
   The projected larger 1990 wheat harvest could put pressure on
market prices, which were indicated in the range of $2.90 to $3.30
per bushel in 1990-91, compared with an estimated $3.71 this season.
   If corn production turns out at the projected level of 8.1
billion bushels, it still wouldn't be quite enough to match
domestic and export demand, the report showed. Thus, the U.S. corn
stockpile, which may be around 1.33 billion bushels next fall,
could edge lower by Oct. 1, 1991.
   Corn prices were projected at $2.25 to $2.65 per bushel in
1990-91, compared with the current season's forecast of $2.30 to
$2.40 per bushel.
   Looking at the global situation, the analysis said prelminary
indications ``point to larger crops in a number of countries and
continued growth in use.'' World wheat production is expected to be
record large in 1990-91, the report said.

   There's a novel here somewhere, buried deep
in a mountain of 10,000 opening lines, an Everest of literary
lunacy by writers trying to be as bad as they can be and succeeding.
   And whether scrawled by hand or written on word processors, they
all vied in the ninth annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, a
celebration of mangled language in the name of a 19th century
novelist.
   Linda Vernon, a housewife in Newark, Calif., copped the grand
prize this year with her mixed metaphors and overdone images, San
Jose State University English professor Scott Rice announced
Thursday.
   Rice, the contest's originator, called Vernon's purple prose
``an example of a writer getting carried away with figures of
speech.''
   If you're reading aloud, take a breath and give it a try:
   ``Dolores breezed along the surface of her life like a flat
stone forever skipping along smooth water, rippling reality
sporadically but oblivious to it consistently, until she finally
lost momentum, sank and, due to an overdose of fluoride as a child
which caused her to suffer from chronic apathy, doomed herself to
lie forever on the floor of her life as useless as an appendix and
as lonely as a five-hundred-pound barbell in a steroid-free fitness
center.''
   Vernon, a 38-year-old mother of three who's taking writing
courses, won a word processor.
   ``It takes a lot of talent to be a bad writer,'' she said.
``This is a good start, but I hope this is not the peak of my
career.''
   Runner-up Richard G. Carter of Hampton, Va., took a more
gruesome tone:
   ``Since both parties demanded sole custody in the Frankenstein
divorce case, the judge called for his Sword-of-Solomon
bolt-cutters and ruled an equitable split: Victor was to raise the
creature's grotesque body in Palo Alto while his ex-wife reared its
ugly head in San Jose.''
   Rice, who has published several books from the entries over the
years, sees the contest as a way to encourage people to have fun
with language and make a statement, in a way, about the importance
of literacy.
   Edward Bulwer-Lytton earned the distinction of a contest in his
name by beginning his 1830 novel ``Paul Clifford'' with that
potboiling opener popular with Snoopy of the ``Peanuts'' comic

   Design flaws in the Army's advanced transport
helicopter forced at least one pilot to take the unusual step of
flying the aircraft just 600 feet above the ground.
   The pilot figured he would have a better chance of landing
safely if anything went wrong with the helicopter, say
congressional investigators.
   Members of the General Accounting Office, working for a House
panel, told lawmakers Thursday that the Army has been unable to
overcome persistent safety problems with the helicopter that killed
15 soldiers in two accidents.
   Investigators said the CH-47D Chinook helicopter experienced
failures with its transmission cooling fans, flight-control rods
that burned and cracked cross shafts.
   ``We recommend that the Army be required to report to Congress
on progress in fixing current problems on the CH-47D,'' they said.
``Funding for additional aircraft purchases should be contingent on
the Army presenting convincing evidence that aircraft problems have
been resolved.''
   The Army plans to buy 472 of the helicopters produced by Boeing
Vertol of Philadelphia and AVCO-Lycoming of Stratford, Conn.
Pentagon plans call for buying the last 144 helicopters at a cost
of about $900 million.
   Investigators, who visited five of the seven Army sites where
the helicopters are used, said widespread mechanical problems have
forced the service to ground the aircraft nine times.
   Army officials disputed the conclusions of the yearlong inquiry
by investigators into the $6.4 million helicopter.
   ``The CH-47D is the safest cargo helicopter in the United States
inventory,'' Maj. Gen. Donald Williamson, head of the Army
Aviations Systems Command, told the panel.
   But Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, questioned
the Army's actions.
   ``There is simply no justification for putting our soldiers at
avoidable risk because of mechanically deficient aircraft,''
Dingell said.
   A 1988 accident in Chico, Texas, that killed 10 soldiers and
injured eight others was blamed on a cooling fan transmission that
came apart. Investigators said the fan sometimes shatters when the
aircraft vibrates too much, spewing debris that damages the
transmission.
   Investigators also testified it took the Army 18 years to
replace the helicopter's aluminum flight-control rods, which are
susceptible to burning, with fire-resistant steel rods.
   During that time, the Army tried to prevent the rods from
burning by treating them with a fire-resistant paint and wrapping
them in firesleeves, investigators said.
   A helicopter that crashed in Honduras in December 1988, killing
five soldiers, was one of 73 aircraft whose control rods had not
been treated with the paint.
   ``While development, testing and production f steel rods was
under way, silicone fire sleeves were installed as an interim
measure to afford protection. All aircraft were retrofitted with
steel rods by September 1989,'' said Williamson.

<HEAD>CBO Sees $43 Billion in Savings By Relying on Reserves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional analysts say a greater reliance
on military reserves could save the United States $43 billion over
several years by cutting active duty forces.
   ``Changes in threats to U.S. security, coupled with downward
pressure on the defense budget, suggest that the reserves may take
on even greater importance,'' Robert Reischauer, director of the
Congressional Budget Office, told a Senate panel Thursday.
   Under the proposed scenario, active duty armed forces would be
cut by 463,000, down to 1.6 million. The reduction would increase
the share of the reserves in the total force from 36 percent to 42
percent.
   Analysts presented their findings at a Senate Armed Services
Committee hearing on increased use of the reserves at a time when
the Soviet threat to the West has diminished and constraints on the
budget has grown.
   ``In this period of increased warning time and fiscal austerity,
I think we have to conduct a fundamental re-examination of the use
of the reserves in all of the military services,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the panel.
   President Bush's defense budget for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 calls for $303 billion for the military _ a total that has
come under attack in Congress as too high.
   The CBO director told the panel more than $43 billion could be
saved over five to seven years by cutting the active duty forces
and maintaining the current level of reserves.
   According to the CBO, 1.2 million people serve in the selected
reserves, which includes personnel who have been on active duty and
train part-time. Another 524,000 people belong to the individual
ready reserve, many of whom have completed active duty service but
do not train in peacetime.
   The CBO director also proposed new approaches that included
``nested'' ships in the Navy, stored aircraft in the Air Force or
cadre units for the Army.
   Nesting would involve stationing four or five ships together,
including one mother ship.
   ``Except for the mother ship, all the vessels would be in a
stored status. They might go to sea for training but would not be
deployed overseas in peacetime,'' Reischauer said.
   The Air Force, according to the CBO, could store its aircraft at
Davis Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona, where it would be
maintained in non-operating status.
   The Army could adopt a cadre system in which each Army division
would retain on active duty about 3,000 non-commissioned officers
and senior officers. In the event of war, reserves who have been
off active duty for fewer than 18 months could be called up.
   The system is similar to that employed in West Germany.

<HEAD>Baker To See Mubarak In Moscow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
meet in Moscow next week with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak but
plans no new strategy for opening negotiations between Israel and
Palestinian Arabs, U.S. officials say.
   Baker's main purpose for going to Moscow is to hold talks with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on the May 30-June 3
superpower summit meeting in Washington.
   However, Mubarak will be in the Soviet capital as well, giving
Baker a chance to discuss the Middle East situation with the
Egyptian leader, the officials said Thursday.
   Baker's plan for Israeli-Palestinian talks is on hold while
Israel tries to form a new government. Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir declined to endorse the plan because it provides for
Palestinians expelled from the West Bank and former residents of
Jerusalem to participate in the negotiations.
   Still, U.S. officials, who insisted on anonymity, said Baker
intends to try again after a new government takes over in Jerusalem.
   Mubarak has served as a middleman between the United States and
the Palestine Liberation Organization, relaying PLO demands and
then advising Washington what Arafat's group finds acceptable or
objectionable.
   Arafat made a one-day visit to Cairo last week to see Mubarak,
the only Arab leader whose country has signed a peace treaty with
Israel. Their meeting was believed to deal mainly with the PLO's
call for an Arab summit.
   On Thursday, meanwhile, the Bush administration again criticized
Israel for settling Soviet Jews on the West Bank and in Gaza but
said it was not conspiring with Arab governments at the United
Nations to curtail immigration.
   ``We want to see immigration take place and will oppose efforts
by anyone to block it,'' Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department
spokeswoman, said.
   However, the administration, which is hotly opposed to the
settlements, did not promise to veto _ and thereby kill _ any
resolution in the U.N. Security Council aimed at Israel.
   And an Israeli source, insisting on anonymity, said a resolution
being prepared condemns settling Soviet Jews in Jerusalem and
upholds a right of expatriate Arabs to return to Israel.
   ``We are very disturbed,'' the source told The Associated Press.
   Moshe Arad, the Israeli ambassador to Washington, conveyed the
concern to Robert Kimmitt, the under secretary for political
affairs, on Tuesday at the State Department.
   Then Foreign Minister Moshe Arens went public, saying in
Jerusalem on Thursday that he was troubled the United States was
working with Arab governments on a resolution.
   For the time being the dispute has been sidetracked. The
Security Council postponed indefinitely its consideration of the
resolution.
   And the White House and State Department tried to soft-pedal the
settlements issue, which has flared for several months.
   ``We're a member of the Security Council, so quite obviously we
would be a part of the deliberations and the discussions but we
have not taken a position on that resolution or any specific
resolution,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said.
   ``Israel is our close friend, our strong ally. Our bilateral
relationship is very strong. As with any strong friendship there
are differences of opinion on certain issues,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Tutwiler.
   ``These can and should be managed in a mutually satisfactory
fashion,'' she said.
   The Bush administration insists that settling Jews on the West
Bank and in Gaza presents an obstacle to a negotiated settlement in
the Middle East.
   Only a small percentage of Jewish immigrants from the Soviet
Union have wound up in the territories surrendered by Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day War.
   The Bush administration considers those settlements an obstacle
to Mideast negotiations since the Arabs hope to recover the lands
from Israel.
   Additionally, President Bush objects to Soviet Jews living in
East Jerusalem, which Israel won in 1967 and made part of its
capital city.
   Without referring directly to Jerusalem, or to its inclusion in
the prospective resolution, spokeswoman Tutwiler said ``the
government of Israel is well aware of our concern that Soviet Jews
not be encouraged to move into the territories.''
   Therefore, she said, ``we find the foreign minister's comments a
little confusing.''
   And yet, the Bush administration supports Jewish emigration from
the Soviet Union to Israel and will keep pressing the Soviet Union
to permit direct flights to Tel Aviv, Ms. Tutwiler said.

<HEAD>Foes of Family Leave Bill Say They Can Sustain Veto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of a bill that guarantees workers up
to three months of unpaid leave in family emergencies say they're
confident they can sustain a presidential veto of the measure
passed by the House
   The 237-187 vote Thursday sent the family and medical leave bill
to the Senate, where it faces a contentious and uncertain future.
   Alixe Glen, White House deputy press secretary, called the vote
close and said President Bush remained firm in his opposition.
Bush's aides and spokesmen have threatened a veto.
   ``He fully supports and encourages flexible family leave
policies by all employers, but feels that should not be dictated by
a Washington mandate,'' she said. ``Employers and employees know
what works for them best.''
   One of the sponsors of the final version, Rep. William Clay,
D-Mo., called the margin ``a landslide.'' But the vote fell well
short of what would be needed to override a presidential veto.
   Though the bill had the backing of the House Democratic
leadership, 54 Democrats sided with business groups that opposed
the bill. Thirty-nine Republicans supported the bill.
   ``The business community is very happy about this vote _ we got
well over what we needed to sustain a veto,'' said Mary Tavenner,
lobbyist for the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.
   The bill would require business and government employers to
provide workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave or
leave for the care of a new child or ill child, parent or spouse.
It exempts businesses with fewer than 50 workers.
   Employers would have to continue health insurance benefits for
those on leave and restore a returning employee to his or her
previous job or an equivalent position.
   Foes said the bill would be costly and burdensome for
businesses, ultimately hurting American competitiveness. But
supporters said nearly all industrialized nations already provide
such minimum job security to workers, many with provisions for full
or partial pay.
   In the Senate, a similar bill won a committee vote more than a
year ago. But it's a divisive issue that could tie up the Senate in
protracted debate, and Democratic leaders have yet to schedule
Senate floor action.
   The bill is the second dealing with family concerns the White
House has threatened to veto this year, after a child-care
assistance bill now in conference committee.
   Democrats tried to contrast that record with Bush's public
support for family values. The bill's supporters hoped
election-year pressure would prompt the president to relent in his
veto threat.
   ``Every piece of legislation that comes through here, there's a
threat of a veto,'' Clay said. ``I don't know if the president is
willing to veto all of these.''
   The bill's chief Republican sponsor, Rep. Marge Roukema of New
Jersey, said she hoped to persuade Bush not to veto the bill.
   ``I don't think the president or the Republican Party or the
Democratic Party wants to go into an election year looking as
though they are against working families,'' Roukema said.

<TEXT>
   Some congressmen challenging the 1990 farm
bill say U.S. agriculture policy gives too many subsidies to people
who don't need them.
   ``The bigger you are the more money you have, the more money you
are entitled to get,'' Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said Thursday of
the legislation that governs all farm programs.
   Frank is part of a coalition being organized by Reps. Richard
Armey, R-Texas and Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to oppose subsidies in
the bill.
   None of the coalition members is a member of the Agriculture
Committee.
   Schumer acknowledged the members of group aren't all interested
in the same subsidy programs, but said ``in general we have
agreement that agriculture has gotten out of control,''
   Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I., said she opposed the wool
subsidies and Reps. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y. and John Porter, R-Ill.,
spoke out against the sugar program.
   Others opposed the peanut program or any subsidy for farms with
annual profits over $100,000.
   Other congressmen at a press conference to introduce the
coalition were Reps. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., and Dana Rohrabacher,
R-Calif.
   Armey said several other congressman were also part of the group.
   ``He's gaining a lot of support with the major media,''
Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, said
recently of Armey's efforts. ``That will have some effect on the
members.''
   De la Garza has indicated, however, that plenty of support
existed in the House for the bill the agriculture panel is writing.
   Frank called the multi-billion dollar farm bill ``one of the
last vestiges of the bad old days when differences were worked out
by adding money to the budget.''
   Attempts to cut the federal deficit are requiring tightening of
the farm programs as well. Both Senate and House agriculture
committees are working with that in mind, though the programs they
have approved contain safeguards for farm income.
   Frank said the government should save its money and let the free
market regulate agriculture.
   Since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the federal government
has enacted laws to regulate the food supply and assure farmers of
certain prices for their crops. Every five years, Congress approves
a farm bill that determines the way and degree in which tax dollars
will be used to support farmers.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top aviation security official is
being reassigned a few days before a presidential commission
releases a report said to be critical of Federal Aviation
Administration security measures.
   Raymond Salazar's decision to become manager of the agency's
Center for Management Development in Palm Coast, Fla., isn't linked
to Tuesday's scheduled release of the report by the Aviation
Security and Terrorism Commission, FAA chief James Busey said
Thursday.
   ``We needed a good man for the job and we've got one,'' Busey
said.
   But relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, welcomed Salazar's
departure as civil aviation security director. They blame Salazar
for flaws in security before the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing and for
what they say are failures to improve some conditions since.
   Salazar has directed civil aviation security since 1986.
   FAA officials declined to comment on whether the reassignment
had anything to do with criticism of Salazar by victims' relatives
and members of Congress, including some on the commission.
   Salazar didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.
   The seven-member commission, headed by former Labor Secretary
Ann McLaughlin, will present its report on the Flight 103 bombing
and other aviation terrorism issues to President Bush on Tuesday.
   The commission report will be ``pretty hard on the FAA'' and
will call for some reorganization, including setting up a high
visibility special security office, according to a congressional
source familiar with some of its recommendations. The source spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Commission spokeswoman Patricia Moran said panel members have
agreed not to reveal contents of the report until after they
present it to the president and victims' relatives.
   Paul Hudson of Albany, N.Y., who speaks for one group of Flight
103 relatives, said the FAA removal of Salazar was long overdue.
   ``He's totally tied to the blunders made prior to 103,'' Hudson
said. ``His leadership clearly has not been effective in
eliminating the security gap.''
   Salazar, appearing at the last commission hearing, denied sworn
testimony by Pan Am officials that he had given the airline a
waiver of some security procedures at Frankfurt, West Germany,
before the bombing. Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt en route to
London and New York.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar defended security operations under
Salazar, saying the security office's budget has doubled since he
took over, with $51.9 million proposed for fiscal 1991.
   The amount devoted to research and development of more
sophisticated bomb detectors for airports has increased from $11.3
million in 1986 to $25 million in the new budget, Farrar said.
   Salazar has been the target of tough grilling by members of
Congress at several hearings since the Lockerbie bombing.

   A car dealer whose discounts for Christian
and Jewish car buyers have been labeled discriminatory by a Jewish
group says he'll decide next week whether to continue the program.
   ``I don't like to step on anybody's toes,'' Freddye ``Action''
Jackson said Thursday. ``Hopefully we can come up with a program
that satisfies everybody.''
   Jackson said he would discuss the program with partners of Brown
Lincoln-Mercury, which began the Christian Members Buyers Plan in
August.
   Patrons who can prove church membership receive discounts
ranging from $150 to $600 on Lincolns and Mercurys. Jackson also
extends the discounts to Jews because he says they believe in God.
He does not, however, include any other religious groups.
   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith has called for an end
to the discount program, labeling it discriminatory despite
Jackson's extension of his offer to Jews.
   Jackson said he would meet next week with David Friedman of
B'nai B'rith.
   William E. Schuling, chairman of Mid-Atlantic Cars Inc. of which
Brown Lincoln-Mercury is the major dealership, was quoted in
published reports as saying the program would be abandoned.
   However, Jackson said he had not made such a decision.
   Ford Motor Co., which builds Lincolns and Mercurys, has said
Jackson is an independent businessman who may decide what type of
incentive programs he wants to offer.

<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. pulled $1 million of
advertising from a television station that had run ads saying
coffee made by the company brews ``misery, destruction and death''
in El Salvador.
   The 30-second spots were bought by a group that advocates a
boycott of Folgers coffee because it includes Salvadoran beans,
said Sy Yanoff, president and general manager of WHDH-TV.
   The group, Neighbor to Neighbor, paid $1,000 for each of two
spots on Wednesday and Thursday, and the advertisements were
cleared with the station's lawyers, he said.
   ``(The ad) met our commercial and good-taste standards,'' Yanoff
said Thursday.
   Don Tassone, a spokesman for Procter &amp; Gamble, said the spots
``disparaged'' Folgers coffee. ``It's advocacy advertising and
we're surprised that any television station is willing to run that
type of ad,'' he said.
   The Boston Globe said WHDH was the only station in the country
to run the ad, which is narrated by actor Ed Asner, a critic of
U.S. military aid to the Salvadoran government.
   ``If you want peace in El Salvador, tell Congress to stop our
massive military handouts and tell your supermarket that you refuse
to buy Folgers, which uses coffee grown in El Salvador. Boycott
Folgers coffee _ What it brews is misery, destruction and death,''
Asner says in the ad.
   ``It's misleading and it's grossly inaccurate,'' Tassone said.
``This ad singles out Folgers even though virtually every U.S.
brand contains some Salvadoran coffee.''
   Neighbor to Neighbor says coffee income enriches wealthy
Salvadorans allied with the rightist Salvadoran government. It says
it has targeted P&amp;G for the boycott because the firm was less
responsive on the issue than its competitors.
   Yanoff said Procter &amp; Gamble at first told him they would pull
only their ads for Folgers coffee, but the station was told
Thursday the firm would pull all its advertising, worth $70,000 for
June and about $1 million for the year.

   Each day, water from a small nearby lake
edges closer to Elaine Coward's home. Once it reaches her driveway,
she's leaving.
   ``There's nowhere for it to go but to head for the Gulf,'' said
Ms. Coward, who hopes to avoid the expected flooding from waters
rampaging down the Trinity River. ``But it's got to run over us
first.''
   The flooding has resulted from last week's heavy rain that
inundated north Texas, more than 200 miles away. The waters are
heading south down the Trinity, making their way into Lake
Livingston and eventually the Gulf of Mexico.
   But many communities sit in its path, including the
Liberty-Dayton area, about 40 miles east of Houston, where
residents have been told they may be hit with the worst flooding in
80 years.
   Some dirt roads already are covered with water, but the real
flooding isn't expected until early next week.
   Already, many residents threatened by flood waters have moved
their belongings to higher ground and made plans to stay elsewhere.
   At Ms. Coward's home, which she has owned for 12 years, the
furniture is up on blocks. Clothes, important documents and
mementos have been moved into a trailer where she will live
temporarily if her home is flooded.
   ``It's hard to accept the fact that the water is going to come
into your home,'' she said Thursday, a mild, sunny day in southeast
Texas. ``It's heartbreaking.''
   Last July, her home was flooded by heavy rains, causing $7,000
worth of damage. It took four months to repair the house.
   Now, she keeps an eye on the water that has creeped to the edge
of her yard. Once it reaches her driveway, she said she knows it is
time to take the dog and leave.
   The potential flooding is the talk of this town of about 6,000
residents, even though many are not expected to be hurt by the
flooding.
   ``If they're not personally affected, they have family or
friends who are,'' she said.
   Jim Mitchum, emergency management director for Liberty County,
said Thursday there already is flooding in some areas because of
the large releases from Livingston Dam, about 25 miles to the north.
   Exactly one year ago, Mitchum said, his agency was dealing with
flood victims after receiving 15{ inches of rain.
   ``How's that for an anniversary?'' he said.
   While a voluntary evacuation notice went to people in low-lying
areas in Liberty County, others _ like George and Brenda Clark _
plan to stay, and they were in town Thursday stocking up on goods.
   ``Everybody's getting ready. They're not waiting like they did
last time,'' Clark said.
   The couple and their 7-year-old son were stranded last year for
two weeks when water flooded the nearby creek and covered the road
to their home.
   ``But we're going to stay. Our house won't get flooded, we're on
high ground,'' he said. ``We're prepared this year.''

<HEAD>Rollback Of Hatch Act Heading For Veto Showdown</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly 3 million federal employees and postal
workers would be allowed for the first time in half a century to
campaign actively for their favorite politicians under a bill
passed by both the Senate and House.
   The two chambers still have to iron out differences in their
versions of the bill before trying to muster votes for overriding a
threatened veto by President Bush.
   The Senate's 54 Democrats garnered support from 13 of the 45
Republicans to pass the legislation by a potentially
veto-overriding 67-30 vote Thursday.
   ``Hopefully we can sustain a veto'' later, said Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas. In Bush's first 16 months in
office, congressional Democrats have been unable in 10 attempts to
override any of his vetoes.
   Bush's senior advisers have said they would urge him to veto any
change in the law as ``undermining the integrity and independence
of the traditionally non-partisan civil service.''
   GOP leaders contended the bill is a ``pot of gold'' for the
Democratic Party because federal employee and postal unions already
contribute nine times more money to Democrats than Republicans
through their political action committees.
   The eight days of debate, much of it focused on union PACs,
before Thursday's final vote provided a preview to what is sure to
be more rancorous battle as the Senate takes up rival versions of
campaign finance reform legislation today.
   ``It's ironical to me we have legislation before us to expand
PACs to make possible for federal employees to dun other employees
... at the very time ... we will be considering campaign reform
legislation to eliminate or at least reduce PACs,'' said Sen.
William V. Roth, R-Del.
   Outlawing PACs entirely while increasing the amount the
individual contributors can donate for political causes is the
centerpiece of the GOP campaign finance proposal.
   The bill approved Thursday would overhaul the Hatch Act. The law
was passed in 1939 in response to evidence that enrollees in the
Works Progress Administration were being required by New Deal
political appointees to donate to the re-election campaign of
then-Sen. Alben Barkley, D-Ky.
   The legislation was sought by federal employee and postal unions
after the Reagan administration filed Hatch Act charges against
three union presidents for endorsing Democrat Walter Mondale in the
1984 presidential election. The charges were later dismissed by a
federal appeals court.
   Because a permanent and professional civil service is
well-established now, Democrats contended most of the Hatch Act
restrictions are no longer needed.
   Sen. Brock Adams said federal workers now enjoy fewer political
rights under an ``archaic curtain of silence'' than people do in
the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.
   Republicans, however, contend the legislation will return the
civil and postal services to a ``spoils system'' in which workers
will be subtly coerced to take up political causes.
   The bill would still prohibit federal workers from engaging in
political activities while on the job and from running for public
office or soliciting campaign funds from the public.
   But they could in their off time begin holding office in local,
state and national political organizations, attend their
conventions as delegates and solicit campaign funds fromco-workers
on behalf of candidates or federal employee union political action
committees.
   The House passed by a veto-proof 297-90 vote a year ago a
similar but broader bill that also would remove the prohibitions on
running for office and soliciting campaign funds.
   Before the Senate vote Thursday, Republicans made a stab at
trying to continue the current restrictions on employees of the
IRS, intelligence agencies, the Justice Department and the Federal
Election Commission.
   ``Certain critical agencies of this government need to be beyond
political involvement ... (and) not have any taint of politics or
coercion,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M.
   His amendment to exempt employees of those agencies from the
looser restrictions on political involvement and forbid government
workers from soliciting co-workers for campaign funds was defeated
on a 58-39 vote.
   The Senate, however, did adopt on a 97-0 vote an amendment by
Dole that would maintain the current restrictions on the 240
employees of the Federal Election Commission.

   Walker Percy, whose deeply humane novels
and essays made him a unique voice in American letters, died
Thursday of cancer at age 73.
   Percy's first novel, ``The Moviegoer,'' won him the National
Book Award in 1962.
   After ``Moviegoer,'' Percy's novels included ``The Last
Gentleman'' (1966), ``Love in the Ruins'' (1971), ``Lancelot''
(1977), ``The Second Coming'' (1980), and ``The Thanatos Syndrome''
(1987).
   Percy peddled his 1983 ``Lost in the Cosmos'' as ``the last
self-help book.''
   His other major piece of non-fiction was ``The Message in the
Bottle'' (1975), essays on the philosophy of language.
   Percy was named by Pope John Paul II as the only American on the
Pontifical Council for Culture.

   Aurora Hinojosa Casillas traveled more
than 200 miles to Chihuahua and although she knew she wouldn't get
close to Pope John Paul II, she said just hearing him was enough.
   She joined more than 100,000 other people Thursday on a dusty
stretch of baseball fields to see the ``pilgrim pope.''
   ``For us it is the ultimate to come here,'' said Mrs. Hinojosa,
of Ciudad Juarez across the border from El Paso, Texas. ``Since I
was born, I've been a Catholic and it's important. He is closer to
God.''
   The crowd sang hymns and chanted cheers as they awaited the
pontiff, but turned frantic when John Paul's approach was broadcast
play-by-play over loudspeakers.
   Hundreds clung to a wire fence separating them from the
motorcade, while the more agile scurried to keep up with the
glassed-enclosed popemobile.
   ``I am so pleased that I got so close to him,'' said Brisa
Rivera, 21, as she wiped away tears. ``I got to see him one moment
and no more, but I feel wonderful. This is a proud moment for
Chihuahua.''
   The crowd waved yellow and white banners and their arms as they
sang the hymn ``Hallelujah.''
   Occasionally the crowd let out a cheer: ``A la bim, a la ba, a
la bim boom ba. Papa, Papa, rah, rah, rah!'' The pope is called
``El Papa'' in Spanish.
   Although many had brought blankets and lawn chairs, the majority
stood under the hot sun and many wore sun hats or straw cowboy hats.
   In his half-hour homily, the pope criticized the government's
family planning program and advised fathers to become more involved
in raising their children.
   ``He gave advice that was very good for the family,'' said
Miguel Martinez. ``In particular what he said about the husbands.
We need to listen to his advice because he is a very important
person.''
   For many, the trek to the papal celebration was a Mother's Day
outing _ the holiday is celebrated on May 10 in Mexico.
   ``We have never had a Mother's Day as noble and beautiful as
this,'' said Maria Luisa Lopez Martinez, 56, of Durango, who was
with her mother and sister. ``It is worth it to be here because we
are awaiting the best person of the world. It's something we
wouldn't do for anyone else.''
   Adela Cota de Santiesteban said she left her home almost 900
miles away in Baja California on Monday, crossed the Sea of Cortez
by ferry and arrived here Wednesday. Her family enjoyed the pope's
message, she said, because ``It was about the Mother of God, and we
are mothers.''

   Hillary Pipkin has been farming all his
life, but at the moment all his wheat fields are good for is
fishing.
   As waters continue to surge down the Arkansas, Red and Trinity
rivers in Texas and Arkansas, agriculture is suffering the most.
   ``I'm just hoping we can pay our debts and stay in farming,''
Pipkin said Thursday, ``'cause there's not any profit to be made
this year.''
   Pipkin and his brother grow wheat, cotton, soybeans and rice on
about 1,000 acres in the community where they grew up, a few miles
north of Pine Bluff in central Arkansas. Their land, handed down by
their father, is divided by the Arkansas River levee. About 250
acres on the river side of the levee are under water.
   ``You can walk down there and catch a fish if you want to,''
said Pipkin, pointing to a spot where water swallows the road that
used to cut across his wheat field.
   Pipkin said about half of his 100-acre winter wheat crop is
destroyed.
   ``It's going to hurt the yield, no doubt about that,'' he said.
``I'd say after this we might cut half a crop.''
   And his cotton might not be planted at all.
   ``It's going to hurt us bad,'' Pipkin said. ``If we get in any
cotton, it's not going to have time to make enough like it should.''
   Officials are estimating that 450,000 acres of wheat statewide
have been damaged by the flooding which could amount to a $4.8
million loss. Rough estimates indicate 25,000 to 30,000 head of
cattle were stranded by high water, and many are presumed drowned.
   In a letter Thursday to President Bush, Gov. Bill Clinton said
initial official estimates of damage to private, non-agricultural
property total $6.5 million.
   According to preliminary state figures, flooding has damaged 251
homes, but that number will go up as the water recedes, said Gary
Talley, spokesman for the Arkansas Office of Emergency Services.
   The flooding was touched off by last week's severe storms, which
were blamed for 13 deaths, one in Oklahoma and the others in Texas.
   In Texas, estimated damage to agricultural production stands at
$500 million to $700 million, with millions more to houses and
roads.
   Arkansas farmers have been attacking the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, saying it had mismanaged dams _ at Lake Texoma on the
Red River and Lake Eufala, in Oklahoma, on the Arkansas.
   After meeting with farmers along the Red River on Wednesday,
Clinton said he would talk with members of Arkansas' congressional
delegation about the possibility of forming a task force to study
the corps' flood management.
   ``So many of them down there felt, rightly or wrongly, that the
corps could have made different decisions on over the last few
months (and) there would be less flooding,'' Clinton said.
   The corps rebutted complaints that its discharges from rising
lakes was too much, too late.
   ``Our projects operated as they were designed to. We managed
them just exactly as they were designed to operate,'' Ross Adkins,
spokesman for the corps in Tulsa, Okla., said Thursday.
   ``What we do is capture all the water we can to minimize any
damages downstream. When Mother Nature dumps as much rain as we had
... they (the reservoirs) took off a heck of a big bump that could
have gone downstream.
   ``If we had not been here, a lot more houses and perhaps lives
would have been lost.''
   Decisions by the corps on how fast to release water from the
reservoirs it manages can have a crucial effect on who is flooded,
and how severely. A quick release of water through the dam's
floodgates after a heavy rain increases flooding downstream, while
slower release can mean more flooding upstream if the reservoir
fills up.
   Marilyn Quayle, Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, visited
flooded parts of Dallas on Wednesday and said the Federal Emergency
Management Agency had added nine Texas counties to 16 already named
in a May 2 disaster declaration.

<HEAD>FCC Will Again Consider Applicants' Criminal Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission has
reversed a Reagan-era rule and says it will again consider criminal
records in evaluating broadcast license applicants.
   The FCC in 1986, under then-Chairman Mark S. Fowler, rewrote its
character-policy rules to consider only felony convictions that
appeared to have a direct link with an applicant's ability to tell
the truth and comply with commission rules.
   Also Thursday, the FCC dropped a proposal to allot broadcast
licenses by lottery, and formally opened an investigation into the
charges home satellite-dish owners must pay to receive network and
``superstation'' signals.
   The character-policy revision had been called into question in
1988 when the FCC renewed the license of Williamsburg County
Broadcasting Corp. to operate WKSP-AM in Kingstree, S.C. The
company's principal owner, Gregory Knop, had been convicted of
conspiracy to distribute cocaine and sentenced to five years in
prison.
   The station had told the commission that Knop had a
``non-broadcast-related'' felony conviction, and the FCC did not
investigate further.
   The 1986 revision said crimes that ``shock the conscience'' or
``misconduct which demonstrates the proclivity of an applicant to
deal truthfully with the commission and to comply with our rules
and policies'' were relevant to license-renewal proceedings. The
revision did not say whether drug convictions fell into that
category.
   Explaining Thursday's change, FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said
that ``broadcasting pervades and influences our culture and I think
we must have reasonable standards for holding a license.''
   Under the latest change, all felony convictions and some
misdemeanors will be considered relevant in determining whether a
party should possess a broadcast license.
   The decision was one of several FCC actions designed to tighten
licensing requirements.
   Fowler in 1982 legalized unlimited payoffs between competing
applicants to build stations, an action critics said drew a flood
of nuisance applications from parties simply wanting to be paid off
to withdraw.
   On Thursday, the FCC proposed to restrict such payoffs, perhaps
to 50 percent of expenses after the licensing process reaches a
newly proposed settlement conference stage.
   The FCC said its action would discourage ``sham'' applicants.
   The commission also dropped a proposal by Fowler's Reagan-era
successor, Dennis Patrick, to use lotteries to award radio and
television station licenses.
   Opponents have said the selection of licensees should not be
left to a roll of the dice and that such a system would throw open
broadcasting to unqualified applicants who, after gaining a
license, could sell it to the highest bidder.
   The lottery proposal also would have ended the existing
preference in the licensing procedure for applications filed by
women members of minorities.
   In opening the inquiry into prices home satellite-dish owners
pay to get the same signals available to cable television
companies, the commission was following up on its December finding
of ``disturbing evidence'' that cable operators receive
preferential treatment from satellite TV carriers.
   The FCC cited assertions by the National Rural
Telecommunications Cooperative that some companies may be charging
back-yard dish owners 20 times more than cable TV systems for the
same programs.

<HEAD>Dollar Plunges Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen Friday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose moderately.
   The dollar closed at 154.15 yen, down 2.60 yen from Thursday's
close of 156.75 yen. It started trading at 155.75 yen, and ranged
between 153.90 and 155.75.
   On the stock market, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gained
531.88 points, or 1.72 percent, to close at 31,512.14. The index
gained 34.65 points Thursday.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's plunge mainly to its overnight
weakness against major European currencies, especially the Swiss
franc.
   The franc has been rising because of high Swiss interest rates,
strong Asian demand and the increasing tendency to view the franc
as a ``safe haven'' currency, they said.
   ``The dollar's weakness against European currencies is
encouraging Tokyo investors to sell the dollar and buy the yen,''
said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities Co.
   ``Although there is demand for the dollar among trading houses,
the market is basically in a dollar-selling mood,'' he said.
   Kanai said the belief that the U.S. economy is slowing also
helped push the dollar down against other currencies. A soft
economy could allow U.S. interest rates to ease, weakening the
attraction of holding dollars.
   Market participants were reassessing the situation following the
dollar's sudden plunge, dealers said. The dollar seemed to have a
floor at about 154.60 yen, they said.
   Some market players remained on the sidelines awaiting the U.S.
government's release later Friday of the U.S. producer price index
and retail sales figures for April.
   The surge in the yen as well as in Japanese government bonds
helped stock prices but was not fully reflected in the Nikkei's
moderate rise, traders said.
   ``The equity market was surprisingly uninspired by the strength
of the yen and bond markets,'' said Matthew A. Rifkin, assistant
vice president for equity trading at Prudential-Bache Securities
(Japan).
   Rifkin attributed the market's restrained reaction to big
advances earlier in the week and reluctance to make major moves
ahead of the weekend. ``The market has moved pretty far already
this week,'' he said.

<HEAD>Top Banking Regulators Discuss Tight Credit With Bankers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
and other top banking regulators blame a slowing economy, and not
over-aggressive bank regulation, for increased difficulties in
getting credit.
   Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke and L. William
Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., joined
Greenspan on Thursday in meeting with the board of the American
Bankers Association to allay fears about what they call
misconceptions about tightening credit.
   Such a gathering is practically unheard of, though all the
regulators frequently meet bankers and other business executives
separately.
   The three asked to attend the association's board meeting to
respond to charges that over-regulation is making bank credit
suddenly too difficult for real estate developers and other
businesses to get.
   ``We decided that it would be very useful for us to meet with
our colleagues and increase communication,'' Greenspan said.
   He dismissed talk of a ``credit crunch,'' in the Northeast or
elsewhere, saying, ``The evidence of that is quite limited.''
   ``We need to turn down the rhetoric,'' said Clarke, whose office
has sent extra examiners to the Northeast, where real estate prices
have been declining and several banks have heavy real estate
portfolios.
   ``It was an opportunity to get the point across to them that we
believe that we're doing the right thing,'' Clarke said. ``We need
the support of the industry in connection and (need to) try to
clarify some of the misconceptions that may be out there about what
we're doing.''
   The association, which represents banks holding 93 percent of
the commercial banking assets in the country, offered a subdued
response compared with the criticism Clarke and others have
received from politicians.
   The politicians complain that regulators are overreacting to the
S&amp;L scandals, where many institutions were brought down by unsound
real estate loans.
   In a news conference following the hour-long meeting,
association officials discounted the severity of any tightening of
credit.
   ``The ABA board told the regulators that thorough but balanced
supervision is the best way to keep the commercial banking industry
safe, sound and competitive,'' said ABA President Kelly Holthus.
The board consists of presidents of banks ranging from
international institutions to small state banks.
   Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president of the association,
agreed that the credit slowdown has more to do with a general
economic slowdown than with aggressive regulatory practices.
Association officials, however, said it was true that some banks
were cutting back their lending in response to tougher regulatory
supervision.
   A key message brought to the meeting by the regulators was that
banks should continue to make sound loans.

   A defector says China's Communist Party
planned to browbeat about 100 exchange students in the United
States considered ``ringleaders'' in criticizing the Beijing
government, The Washington Post reported in today's editions.
   Xu Lin, a third secretary in the education section of the
Chinese Embassy, told the Post that embassy officials were told to
go to U.S. college campuses to court sympathetic students and
intimidate the others.
   Xu provided documents to support his claim, the newspaper said.
   Today's editions of The New York Times also carried an account
of the documents.
   ``To strike the ringleaders, we should give them a bad name,''
the Post quoted one of the documents as saying. ``Now we must think
of a name that has a resounding effect; we cannot use the word
dissident.''
   The documents classify the students under five headings, ranging
from loyal Communists to the ``reactionary core elements who
actively organize and plan anti-government activities.''
   Tactics to be used against the dissidents, the documents
suggested, could include keeping files on them, revoking passports,
cutting off government stipends, firing them from their jobs back
in China and isolating them from their families still at home.
   President Bush has signed an executive order promising that
Chinese students in the United States will not be forced to return
home against their will.
   More than 50,000 government-sponsored exchange students are
studying in the United States and Canada, and the documents said 70
percent to 80 percent of them would not return to China.
   The State Department says it is looking into allegations that
students were harassed, the Post said.
   A Chinese Embassy spokesman told the newspaper that the
allegations in the documents were ``rumors.''

   It looked like a breeze election when
George E. J. Carr and Theresa B. Quincel ran unopposed for the
county Democratic Central Committee.
   All they needed was one vote apiece. But no one, not even the
candidates themselves, wrote their names in and they both lost in
Tuesday's primary.
   Neither Carr or Ms. Quincel were disappointed.
   Carr, a retired sheet-metal worker, said a friend talked him
into running for the job after no one filed nominating petitions.
   Carr, 71, later had second thoughts.
   ``I didn't really want the commitment,'' he said. ``I want to
come and go as I please. Plus, I have arthritis, so I didn't even
vote for myself.''
   Ms. Quincel, 36, said her political activity is limited to
voting and called her candidacy an honest mistake. She said someone
in the party offered her a job similar to one held by her niece,
who she said is a precinct judge.
   ``Two weeks before the election, I found out the job was as a
committee member and by then it was too late to change,'' she said.
   The central committee will fill the vacancies by appointment.

   Federal appeals court Judge Alex Kozinski,
an avowed film buff, couldn't resist using 204 movie titles in an
antitrust decision.
   In a 25-page decision Wednesday for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, Kozinski rejected a federal antitrust suit accusing
theater operator Raymond Syufy of monopolizing the first-run film
market in Las Vegas.
   By Kozinski's account, the trial lasted not eight days or nine
but ``8{,'' as in the Fellini film.
   He wrote the middle initial of Syufy's lawyer, Maxwell Blecher,
as ``M,'' without a period _ the title of the 1931 Fritz Lang-Peter
Lorre classic.
   Syufy was ``somewhat of a Local Hero,'' the judge wrote.
   Another chain ``stepped into the Major Leagues, and Against All
Odds'' began competing seriously. The competitor's theaters
``evolved from Absolute Beginners, barely Staying Alive, into a Big
Business.''
   Some of the titles were natural fits to the case. Kozinski wrote
that antitrust law did not require rivals to finish in a ``Dead
Heat'' as long as they were allowed to do their ``Personal Best.''
He described bureaucrats who ostensibly saw ``The Big Picture'' and
knew how to ``Do The Right Thing.''
   Others matches were more difficult. He wrote that Syufy entered
the Las Vegas market with a ``Splash,'' that competitors saw their
future as ``Rocky,'' and that a ``Little Big Man'' might hold
monopoly power.

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty
for two men charged with murdering a drug case witness in what
would be the first execution by the U.S. government in 27 years.
   ``We recognize the death penalty is an extreme sanction,''
Andrea L. Zopp, one of the federal prosecutors handling the case,
said Thursday. ``We think it is appropriate in this case.''
   It would be the first use of a November 1988 federal law that
allows the death penalty for murders committed to further drug
conspiracies. The so-called ``drug kingpin'' provisions sanction
the death penalty for murders ordered by drug dealers as part of
their business.
   Alexander Cooper and Anthony Davis are charged with murdering a
federal witness to protect their $50,000-a-day drug ring. Davis is
still at large.
   In a statement, U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said,
``Street level distribution networks such as the one alleged in
this indictment cannot be effectively dismantled without the
cooperation of citizen-witnesses.
   ``When those witnesses are murdered because of their cooperation
with law enforcement authorities, Congress has determined that this
ultimate sanction should be available.''
   Federal authorities are ``eager to show that they're tough on
drug crime,'' but the law won't stop drug dealers from killing,
said Henry Schwarzschild, director of the Capital Punishment
Project for the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``They expect to get away with it. They don't expect to get
caught. And if you expect to get away with it, you don't care if
the penalty is 40 years in prison or the electric chair,'' he said
in a telephone interview from New York.
   ``We're certainly not pleased with the federal government
getting back into the business of death penalty cases and having a
federal hangman again, but it's certainly not anything surprising,
and it's not a great legal event,'' said Schwarzschild.
   No civilian has been executed in a federal case since Victor
Feuger was hanged at Iowa State Prison on March 15, 1963, after
being convicted on charges of kidnapping and murder, Schwarzschild
said.
   The provision's constitutionality is certain to face court
challenges, but Schwarzschild said federal lawmakers were probably
careful to make the law conform with guidelines set up by the U.S.
Supreme Court in the 1970s.
   ``We think the statute is clearly constitutional and will pass
constitutional muster,'' Zopp said.
   Older federal law has death penalty provisions for such crimes
as treason, assassination of the president and top federal
officials, and killings involving aircraft hijackings, train
wrecks, kidnappings and bank robberies.
   Those statutes, however, were never amended to reflect changes
in death penalty laws mandated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972,
and are widely considered unconstitutional.
   The 1988 law is the first new statute to take the Supreme Court
guidelines into account, legal experts said.
   Under military law, provisions exist for capital punishment for
violent crimes or spying. But no member of the U.S. military has
been executed in peacetime since 1961, Schwarzschild said.
   Cooper, 29, and Davis, 39, had been named along with 20 others
in two indictments issued Oct. 19 charging them with various
federal drug charges.
   Federal authorities say Cooper ran an extensive street-level
operation from 1982 to 1989 that distributed up to six kilograms of
heroin and two kilograms of cocaine a week.
   Cooper directed Davis to kill an associate, Robert Parker,
because Parker was cooperating with police and giving federal
authorities information about the drug operation, the government
said.
   Parker was shot in the head five times Feb. 6.
   Telephone calls to attorneys for Cooper went unanswered Thursday
night.
   The death penalty has withstood recent legal challenges in
Illinois, which expects to execute a prisoner this year for the
first time in 28 years. Thirteen other states have executed a total
of 124 inmates since the Supreme Court allowed states to restore
the death penalty in 1976.

   Newsday is in an uproar again after a columnist
defended fellow writer Jimmy Breslin _ suspended for slurring a
Korean-American reporter _ and in doing so used what one official
claimed was an epithet for Irishmen.
   Peter King, comptroller of Nassau County, demanded that Newsday
reprimand columnist Robert Reno and order him to apologize for his
article in Thursday's paper.
   King, an outspoken supporter of Irish nationalism, accused Reno
of ``arrogant insensitivity, if not outright anti-Irish racism''
and called him ``a man of unbounded ignorance and stupidity.''
   Reno Thursday tried to defend the Pulitzer Prize-winning
columnist by writing: ``Breslin has a pathologically rotten temper
for which all his greatness is no excuse. On the other hand, if he
wasn't capable of such mindless, offensive and imaginative rages,
he'd just be another windy Irishman.''
   The article ran in some editions with the headline ``A Lion's
Heart, A Donkey's Head Belong to Breslin.''
   ``Even in the rarefied offices of the Newsday editors, someone
must be aware that donkey is a derogatory term long used against
the Irish,'' King said. He said the term means stupid and
thick-headed.
   ``Apparently, being anti-Irish is a prejudice or an ignorance
which is still acceptable at Newsday,'' King said.
   ``If donkey is a synonym for Irishman, that's a new one on me,''
said Reno, adding he thought King was ``being foolish.''
   The Breslin uproar began when reporter Ji-Yeon Yuh sent a
computer message to Breslin and the newspaper's editor, Don Forst,
in which she called a Breslin colunm sexist.
   Breslin responded by calling Yuh ``slant-eyed'' and a ``yellow
cur.''
   Breslin was suspended without pay for two weeks on Tuesday after
he made light of the tirade.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Say Prison Industries Get Unfair Advantages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private-sector companies face increasingly
stiff competition from a prison manufacturing program that's
growing so rapidly it may soon become the equivalent of a Fortune
500 company, lawmakers say.
   Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., lobbied Thursday for support of a
bill to curb the preferential treatment accorded the federal prison
system in selling products to government agencies.
   ``At least I want the private companies to feel like they're
essentially playing under the same conditions'' as the prisons, he
said.
   He said manufacturers in his district were hurt by the prison
program, which last year sold $361 million worth of products
ranging from clothing to electronics. Furniture sales totaled $90
million, a 20 percent increase over 1988.
   The program employed 13,000 inmates and 1,400 civilians.
   The prison program's sales are expected to double by 1992 as the
inmate population swells, said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., upon which
it ``would rank as a Fortune 500 company and likely dominate the
federal market for furniture and many other products.''
   Upton and Rep. Paul Henry, R-Mich., testified at a hearing of
the House Judiciary subcommittee on courts, intellectual property
and the administration of justice.
   The panel is considering a bill under which prisons would have
to compete on an equal footing with private companies once the
prisons obtain a 10 percent share of the federal market for a
product.
   Currently, federal agencies must buy products from the prison
system if it can meet the purchaser's price and delivery
requirements.

<HEAD>Texas Company Recalling Some Pulmanex Resuscitators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical personnel who use Pulmanex Manual
resuscitators are being asked to return the devices because of a
defect that could be fatal to patients, according to the Food and
Drug Administration.
   Life Design Systems Inc. of Carrollton, Texas, is voluntarily
recalling resuscitators with model numbers beginning with 90, 91,
95 or 96 and ending with a 0, 1, 2 or 3 after the hyphen, the FDA
said Thursday.
   The recalled models have lot numbers 9321 through 9361 and were
made between Nov. 17 and Dec. 27, 1989.
   Life Designs Systems has recalled other models of the
resuscitator for various reasons in five previous recalls, the FDA
said.
   The agency said it did not know of any deaths resulting from a
faulty resuscitator.
   The resuscitator subject to the latest recall comes in adult,
pediatric and neonatal sizes. It consists of a mask that is placed
over the patient's mouth and nose and is attached to a plastic bag.
Squeezing the plastic bag forces air into the patient's lungs.
   In faulty resuscitators, the rear valves can become dislodged
and prevent air from reaching the person being resuscitated, the
FDA said. If the problem is not recognized in time, the patient
could die.

<HEAD>Banks Oppose New Student Loan Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bankers say a new plan to offer college loans
directly through student aid offices could hurt their business.
   Three large student aid organizations are joining together to
form CollegeCredit, a program designed to offer college students
one-stop shopping for assistance. It will help aid officers to more
easily package loans with other forms of assistance.
   The partners in the joint venture are:
   _the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), a
federally-chartered, shareholder-owned company that buys student
loans from lenders and collects the payments.
   _The College Board, a non-profit group which administers
financial aid for colleges and provides a common aid application
form.
   _the Teachers Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities
Fund, a large pension plan for college and private school employees.
   CollegeCredit plans to offer $150 million in loans through The
College Board starting in the 1990-91 school year. Teachers Annuity
is setting aside $50 million and other lenders will supply the
rest. Sallie Mae will buy the loans, replenishing the money
available for future loans. All three groups will earn fee income
in the process.
   Banks complain the program will skim off the cream of the
student loan market degree-granting institutions, leaving them
loans to trade school and community college students, which have a
higher default rate.

<HEAD>Nicarguan Leader Makes Austerity Moves; Workers to Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Struggling to stay afloat, the
government imposed huge price increases and suspended a law
protecting workers' rights. Public employees retaliated by
announcing a strike and an occupation of government offices.
   The indefinite strike by a union federation of the government's
60,000 employees began in some offices late Thursday. A union
leader said it would begin officially today.
   The workers are demanding 200 percent raises to keep pace with
inflation.
   Thursday's austerity measures came a day after Antonio Lacayo,
minister of the presidency, announced that Nicaragua was in
bankruptcy and even more painful remedies had to be implemented.
   In addition to the price hikes and suspension of the workers'
law, President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro devalued the Nicaraguan
cordoba 9 percent in relation to the dollar. It was the second
devaluation in two days and the fourth in three weeks.
   Water rates were doubled, electricity rates tripled and
telephone service hiked 1,300 percent. The government subsidy for
public transportation was eliminated.
   The cordoba traded at 180,000 to the dollar on the parallel
market Thursday, an official rate for most currency transactions.
The rate in January was 38,150.
   The Chamorro government blames its leftist Sandinista
predecessors for the country's economic situation. The treasury was
down to a bare $3 million when Mrs. Chamorro took office last
month, officials of the new government say.
   In a communique Thursday, government workers said they would
protest the new government's actions with ``the immediate takeover
of installations and the blocking of access to ministers and vice
ministers of the government of Mrs. Chamorro.'' The communique was
released by the General Federation of State Workers.
   However, Lino Areas, a federation official, said the strike
could be postponed if the government negotiates.
   Unions are demanding that the government ``make a fair salary
readjustment so that workers can acquire basic consumer products,''
Areas said.
   Laborers now earn an average of about $44 a month and
white-collar workers about $100. They have faced a series of
devaluations and soaring prices both under the Sandinistas and
under Mrs. Chamorro, who took office April 25.
   Inflation, after hitting 33,600 percent in 1988, dropped to
1,800 percent in 1989. There are no reliable estimates for this
year.
   The workers' rights law, approved by the Sandinista government
less than three weeks after it lost Feb. 25 elections, allows
government employees to organize unions, bargain collectively,
strike and exercise other rights.
   Thursday's decree suspends the law until the new government
writes its own rules. It also allows the Labor Ministry to review
all labor contracts signed during the Sandinistas' lame-duck period.
   Referring to suspension of the law, the federation accused the
government of ``preparing general conditions for the massive firing
of state workers.''
   On the political front, meanwhile, Contra rebels said they would
stop a demobilization process begun Tuesday, when about 80 Contras
turned in their weapons to U.N. troops.
   Contra spokesman Alejandro Acevedo said in Miami that the
Sandinista army had failed to pull back from the security zones
where the rebels are gathered. The pullback is called for in the
demobilization agreement signed May 4.
   The U.S.-backed Contras battled the Sandinistas during a 9-year
war. Acevedo said more than 12,000 Contra fighters still hold arms,
but independent observers say Contra forces have been reduced to a
few thousand.

   Scientists cured mice of a disease
similar to multiple sclerosis and said their work could lead to
successful treatment of the human disease, although a cure for
people is 10 or more years away.
   The new method also might help scientists develop treatments for
a variety of other human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid
arthritis, lupus and myasthenia gravis, the California Institute of
Technology announced Thursday.
   In autoimmune diseases, the body's immune system attacks the
body's own tissues instead of simply defending against
disease-causing foreign invaders.
   In multiple sclerosis, certain white blood cells called helper
T-cells attack the body's nerve tissue, causing paralysis, muscle
cramps and weakness, slurred speech, blurred vision, fatigue,
difficulty in coordination, dizziness and loss of balance.
   About 250,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis.
   Scientists from Caltech and Washington University in St. Louis
said they designed special antibodies _ called monoclonal
antibodies _ to destroy the white blood cells that cause a disease
in mice resembling human multiple sclerosis.
   ``While we are quite excited about these results, I think it's
important to emphasize at the outset that we have not developed a
cure for human multiple sclerosis or any other human autoimmune
disease,'' said Caltech biologist Leroy E. Hood.
   ``In my opinion, our technique is at least 10 years away from
human application,'' Hood said in a prepared statement, adding that
he wanted to ``avoid raising false hope in those who suffer from
this debilitating and quite serious disease.''
   During the past decade, other researchers showed monoclonal
antibodies could to some extent reverse or prevent the mouse
disease. Some even used mouse antibodies to treat human multiple
sclerosis patients, who displayed only slight improvement and
developed allergic reactions to the foreign antibodies.
   The method used by Hood's laboratory involved designing
antibodies aimed at the exact type of T-cells that cause the mouse
disease, significantly boosting the proportion of mice in which the
disease was prevented or reversed.
   Of five sick mice given the new treatment, three showed complete
reversal of paralysis within two to seven days, and a fourth's
complete paralysis was reduced to slight paralysis of its tail. The
fifth mouse died. Five other mice were not given the treatment, and
their paralysis wasn't reversed.
   Related experiments in dozens of other mice showed the disease
could be prevented if they were injected with the monoclonal
antibodies before scientists tried to make them sick.
   The study was conducted in Hood's laboratory by research fellows
Dennis Zaller and Gamal Osman, and by Osami Kanagawa at Washington
University. It will be published in next month's issue of the
Journal of Experimental Medicine.
   Development of the new method ``certainly is significant,'' said
Dr. George Ellison, a professor of neurology at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
   If a similar treatment can be developed for humans, ``that would
be a major achievement,'' Ellison said, adding that he agreed with
Hood such therapy was years in the future.
   To perform the experiments, the scientists made mice sick with a
disease called murine experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, or
EAE, which produces symptoms similar to human multiple sclerosis.
   They did this by injecting the mice with a protein found in the
sheaths that coat nerve cell fibers in the brain. The rodents'
immune systems then produced helper T-cells that attacked not only
the injected protein but the protein in the rodents' brains.
   After studying the makeup of this type of T-cell in great
detail, the scientists designed monoclonal antibodies that, when
injected into the sick mice, found and destroyed the
disease-causing T-cells while leaving intact T-cells that protect
the mice against other diseases.
   Hood said use of the technique on human autoimmune diseases is
years away because they are much more complex than the mouse
ailment. Also, he said, understanding of human T-cells is far less
advanced than the understanding of such cells in mice.

   Even his fellow comedians say there's something
a little dicey about Andrew Dice Clay, whose shtick prompted a
``Saturday Night Live'' cast member and musical guest to boycott
this weekend's show.
   Is this an attitude, Dice Man? Or what?
   Pee-wee Herman in a leather jacket, he ain't. Dice is an X-rated
Fonzie, the archetypal corner wiseguy, a lewd, sexist makeout
artist whose kindest term for a woman is ``broad.''
   Dice's comedy is deep, deep blue. He evokes body fluids,
orifices and how they get together on bad dates. His critics say
his jokes are at best crude, and at worst angry, sexually violent,
homophobic and bigoted.
   Last year, MTV banned Clay for life after he delivered a
monologue laced with lewd poetry and references to fat women and
sex during the network's awards show.
   Clay and his defenders say the comedian is only ``acting'' Dice,
that his humor mocks the Dice Man's attitudes and has enough truth
in it to attract an audience of men and women who love him.
   ``I talk about what people do, think or say behind closed
doors,'' Clay told Playboy magazine in a January interview. ``As I
tell the crowds, `I don't write this material. You write it for
me.'''
   ``I don't buy it,'' said Richard Belzer, a comedian who's taken
his share of flak as well as praise for his handling of adult
themes.
   ``I don't mean to sound pretentious, but we do have a
responsibility as comedians, especially if we deal in inflammatory
subjects,'' he said.
   ``There are people that do jokes _ gay-bashing and
anti-minorities _ because it gets a laugh, not because it makes any
kind of statement,'' Belzer said.
   ``I think it's just an easy, cheap, stupid laugh unless you're a
Richard Pryor, a David Steinberg or a Robert Klein: Somebody who
can take social issues in a comedic context and say something
that's incisive and funny without being hurtful or mean-spirited.''
   George Carlin, who made a comedy breakthrough by speaking the
seven words you can't say on television, is worried that Clay's
humor targets the wrong people.
   ``Andrew Clay is picking on underdogs: Gays, women and
immigrants,'' Carlin said. ``His audiences share his beliefs, so
they cheer him on. But Andrew ought to remember that he is Jewish
and the same people who hate gays, women and immigrants probably
have Jews somewhere on their list as well.''
   Clay, 32, born Andrew Clay Silverstein in Brooklyn, was a
struggling actor-impressionist when he donned the studded jacket,
combed up the ducktail and started talking about bad sex. The Dice
Man was born.
   A successful comedy album, HBO comedy specials and sell-out
concerts followed. His first starring role in a feature film, ``The
Adventures of Ford Fairlane,'' opens this summer.
   The current controversy began when Nora Dunn, a cast member on
``Saturday Night Live'' since the '85-86 season, refused to perform
on this week's show because she considers Clay's comedy degrading
and repulsive.
   ``In my heart, I know I don't want to work with him,'' Dunn said.
   Clay told ``Entertainment Tonight'' that Dunn was being silly.
``I've seen her play from hookers to just, like, street tramps. I
wouldn't look at that and go, `If that's really her, I wouldn't do
the show.'''
   Dunn denies ever portraying streetwalkers.
   Pop singer Sinead O'Conner, whose ``Nothing Compares 2 U'' is
No. 2 on the charts, also bowed off the show after her publicist
was alerted by the National Organization for Women and the singer
reviewed tapes of Clay's act.
   ``It would be nonsensical of `Saturday Night Live' to expect a
woman to perform songs about a woman's experience after a monologue
by Andrew Dice Clay,'' the singer said.
   She was replaced Thursday by Spanic Boys, a bluegrass rock 'n'
roll band from Milwaukee, and Julee Cruise, a singer who has been
heard on the soundtrack of the series ``Twin Peaks,'' NBC said.
   ``We're not saying that he should be silenced,'' said Francoise
Jacobsohn, a spokeswoman for NOW's ``media reform'' committee.
``We're saying that he's giving a view that is harmful to women.''
   She said hate crimes are on the rise in this country. ``We have
to make the connection between comics that are sexist and
homophobic, and hate crimes,'' she said. ``We have to let people
know that this kind of humor is not OK.''
   Efforts to interview Clay about the controversy were
unsuccessful. ``He has no statement,'' said Clay publicist Susan
Dubow. ``He's not doing interviews. He's rehearsing for `Saturday
Night Live.'''
   He also backed out of a scheduled taping Thursday of ``The Joan
Rivers Show'' scheduled for broadcast today. Rivers' spokeswoman
Linda Lipman said Clay's representatives gave no reason for the
no-show, other than ``a lot of hemming and hawing.''

   The widow of Italian fashion magnate Aldo Gucci
is challenging a will that leaves all of his American property to
the woman he lived with and to the daughter she bore him.
   Gucci, who died Jan. 19 in Rome at age 84, left an estate worth
millions of dollars. But his will, filed for probate in Manhattan
Surrogate Court, says only that the estate is worth more than
$500,000.
   Olwen Price, 82, Gucci's English-born wife who bore him three
sons, filed a challenge to the will two weeks ago.
   Gucci's will, executed in Palm Beach, Fla., on Nov. 3, 1989,
leaves half of his U.S. estate ``to my wife Bruna Palombo Gucci''
and half to their daughter Patricia Gucci Losio, 25.
   There is no indication that Gucci and Palombo ever formally
married, nor that he divorced Price, though they lived apart for
many years.
   In their petition for probate of the will, Gucci's lawyers named
Price as Gucci's wife, although the will names Palombo.
   The will also says Gucci ``openly acknowledges Patricia Gucci
Losio as his daughter.''
   Price, who lives in Rome, and two of the sons, Paolo of West
Sussex, England, and Roberto of Florence, say the will was ``not
freely or voluntarily made.''
   They charge that it was ``procured by fraud, duress and undue
influence practiced upon the decedent by an individual purporting
to be his wife, to wit, Bruna Palombo.''
   Price's third son, Giorgio of Rome, is not contesting the will.
   Price's court papers also charge that the will was invalid
because the witnesses did not sign in Gucci's presence or in the
presence of each other.
   Price, who says she is entitled to the ``widow's share'' of the
estate, says the 10-page will filed here was revoked by a will
handwritten by Gucci Nov. 8 in Rome. She did not cite the that
will's provisions.
   Karen Barkhorn, a lawyer for the estate, confirmed that an
Italian will exists but refused to comment on its validity.
   Gucci pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 1986 to a year and a
day in prison for evading $7.4 million in income taxes.

<DATELINE>COVINGTON, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walker Percy, whose deeply ethical novels
dealt with displaced Southern men searching for faith and love in
the modern world, has died of cancer at age 73.
   Percy's first successful novel, ``The Moviegoer,'' won the
National Book Award in 1962. It established a theme that would
occupy his entire career, that of spiritually marooned men seeking
to overcome their alienation.
   Historian Shelby Foote, a lifelong friend, was with Percy when
he died Thursday.
   ``He belongs with the great Southern writers,'' Foote said. ``I
think he makes a fifth with (John Crowe) Ransom, (William)
Faulkner, (Thomas) Wolfe and (Eudora) Welty.''
   In Jackson, Miss., Miss Welty said: ``I'm very grieved and very,
very hurt for all his family. His friendship meant a lot to me and
his work meant a great deal to me.''
   A funeral Mass and burial was set for Saturday at St. Joseph's
Abbey near Covington.
   While Percy's protagonists were in the southern mold, his
philosophical concerns were not the same as other well-known
southern writers.
   Trained as a physician, Percy converted to Catholicism in early
adulthood during a period of intense personal examination. His
intellectual underpinnings reflected much study of French
existentialism, and he held true to these foundations to his death,
Foote said.
   ``He never said, `Why is this happening to me?''' Foote said.
``Nothing like that. He tried to reassure his family that this was
all right.''
   Said Miss Welty: ``I don't know anybody like him in any way or
anybody that did have the strong imaginative power and
philosophical power that he had, the scientific power and the
fictional power, all of those twined together into one. That is a
unique quality in his work.''
   Critic Stanley Kauffmann, who edited ``The Moviegoer,'' called
him ``one of the loveliest American writers of this century. ... He
was a natural ... His novel `The Moviegoer' will last as long as
America loves literature.''
   Percy's other novels included ``The Last Gentleman'' (1966),
``Love in the Ruins'' (1971), ``Lancelot'' (1977), ``The Second
Coming'' (1980), and ``The Thanatos Syndrome'' (1987).
   His two major works of non-fiction were ``The Message in the
Bottle'' (1975), essays on the philosophy of language, and ``Lost
in the Cosmos'' (1983) which he called ``the last self-help book.''
   Percy's vision of modern malaise was often ironic, hard-edged
and eerily prophetic. But his writings also contained some of the
most wildly comic and deeply humane messages in contemporary
fiction.
   He also taught writing. It was through his efforts that John
Kennedy Toole's ``A Confederacy of Dunces'' was published
posthumously. The novel won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.
   Born May 28, 1916, in Birmingham, Ala., Percy was orphaned in
his teens. He and his two brothers went to Greenville, Miss., to
live with William Alexander Percy, his father's cousin who was
author of the Southern classic ``Lanterns on the Levee.''
   The Percy household marked young Walker forever with its passing
parade of intellectuals, artists, politicians and vagabonds.
   Percy got a medical degree from Columbia University in 1941. The
next year, working as a pathologist at Bellevue Hospital in New
York City, he caught pulmonary tuberculosis while performing
autopsies on derelicts.
   ``I've often said that getting a light case of TB was the best
thing that could've happened to me. It gave me a period of enforced
idleness,'' Percy said.
   He read voraciously during his three years of recovery and
turned to a life of writing.
   He often gave credit to his ``original Presbyterian work ethic''
for discipline and steadiness. In the mornings he wrote, and in the
afternoons he typed what he'd written. He did not believe in
writer's block, but he was often furiously frustrated.
   He told one interviewer: ``It's a question of being so pitiful
God takes pity on you, looks down and says, `He's done for. Let's
let him have a couple of good sentences.'
   ``It's a strange, abject, little-understood profession.''
   He is survived by his wife, Mary Bernice, two daughters, Mary
Pratt Percy Lobdell and Ann Boyd Percy Moores; two brothers, LeRoy
and Billups Phinizy Percy, and four grandsons.

<HEAD>Soviet Circus Stranded Amid Tales of Bounced Checks and Poor
Promotion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Managers of a Soviet circus, stranded after
just two stops on a planned two-year goodwill tour of the United
States, scrambled to line up investors to get back in the ring.
   ``It's just one of those shows that went on the road and did not
have its act together,'' said Rick Hamilton, executive director of
the Knoxville (Tenn.) Civic Center, where the Great Circus Bim Bom
performed before small crowds last week.
   The circus performers were stranded in motels in suburban
Atlanta after being kicked out of two motels by managers who
questioned whether bills would be paid. The circus animals are in
Newburgh, N.Y., at the headquarters of the company transporting
them.
   The performers are crestfallen, one of them said.
   ``I've been all over the world and this is the first time this
has ever happened,'' said Victor Lomakin, who has a chimpanzee act.
``We have a great show. Not being able to perform is like taking a
piece of gold and throwing it out.''
   The 138-member all-star circus, which includes performers from
60 Soviet circuses, arrived in the United States March 31 to start
its two-year tour.
   After three weeks of training in Wheeling, W.Va., the circus
performed in Hershey, Pa., April 25-29.
   After that stop, the troupe's financial problems began. The
trip's backers, a Kuwaiti father and son, withdrew their support,
according to Nikolaj Vissokovsky, president of International
Showbusiness Inc., a Florida-based firm directing the tour.
   Brooks Savage, a lawyer for Waleed A.A. Ahmad and his father,
Khoorsheed Ahmad, said the men had given the circus a loan and had
never intended to back the whole tour. The backers are out $331,000
plus a promised 10 percent of receipts, Savage said.
   The circus performed to crowds of just 300 and 400 in the
5,200-seat Knoxville arena on May 2 and May 3.
   Hamilton blamed the poor turnout on lack of advance promotion.
``In Knoxville, we only got the (promotional) stuff four days ahead
of time,'' he said.
   The circus next moved to Johnson City, Tenn., but canceled its
performance and moved to suburban Atlanta, where some of the tour's
support contractors were based, to regroup.
   Tales of bounced checks at Hershey, Knoxville and Johnson City
soon caught up with the circus, and some members of the troupe were
kicked out of a Motel 6 in Marietta on Wednesday and others from
the Brittany Park Hotel on Thursday.
   Most ended up in a Scottish Inns of America, where they were
trying on Thursday to find cash to pay their bills and keep their
rooms.
   John Stallion, the circus' promotions director, said a new
financial backer planned to wire $2,000 to him to pay for the
rooms. He declined to identify the backer.
   Vissokovsky said the promoters' ``No. 1 priority'' is paying the
string of bad debts. He estimated the circus owes about $450,000 to
trucking, lighting and other production companies.
   He said he was talking again with the Kuwaiti investors as well
as others who might be interested in sponsoring the circus.
   ``We're all hanging in there,'' Vissokovsky said. ``We've got a
lot of damage control to do. We need to clean up our name.''
   Officials in Washington said Thursday they were aware of the
circus's plight but had no plans to intervene.
   ``There are absolutely no political implications _ this just
appears to be a case of a business venture gone bad,'' said Sidney
Smith of the State Department.
   Vissokovsky said a Soviet Embassy official told him Thursday
that any decision about abandoning the tour would have to be made
by the circus' director, Yuri Turkin.

<HEAD>Dollar Drops, Prices Rise in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar plummeted against the yen in Tokyo today
as the stronger Japanese currency pushed prices sharply higher on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 154.15 yen, down 2.60 yen from Thursday's
close of 156.75 yen. It started trading at 155.75 yen, its high for
the day, and ranged as low as 153.90 yen.
   Dealers said an overnight decline in the dollar's value against
the Swiss franc and West German mark pushed it below a technical
floor, resulting in widespread dollar selling.
   The franc has been rising because of high Swiss interest rates,
strong Asian demand and the increasing tendency to view the franc
as a ``safe haven'' currency, dealers said.
   Japan's major securities houses sold the dollar heavily in the
morning. After lunch, they were joined by life insurers and other
major market players, said John Radinoff, vice president of Goldman
Sachs (Japan).
   ``The yen has been massively oversold, and people have been
looking for excuses to sell dollars,'' Radinoff said.
   Some market players remained on the sidelines awaiting the U.S.
government's release later today of the U.S. producer price index
and retail sales figures, both for April, which are expected to
point to an economic slowdown.
   Concern that the U.S. economy is slowing also helped push the
dollar lower, dealers said.
   None of Tokyo's markets reacted perceptibly to unconfirmed
rumors circulating throughout financial circles in Asia that
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, or another senior leader, Chen Yun,
was seriously ill, traders said.
   Chinese Foreign Ministry officials denied the rumor, calling it
a ``fabrication with ulterior motives.''
   The source of the rumor was unclear, market sources said.
   The surge in the yen's strength as well as in the Japanese
government bond market helped stock prices but was not fully
reflected in the Nikkei Stock Average's moderate rise, traders said.
   The 225-share Nikkei index gained 531.88 points, or 1.72
percent, to close at 31,512.14. The index gained 34.65 points
Thursday.
   The index climbed only 185.68 points in the morning session but
surged higher in the afternoon after market participants became
confident that the yen had strengthened substantially, traders said.
   ``In the morning, dealers were staring at their screens and
asking if there had been some kind of mistake. It was remarkable,''
said Paul Muller, manager of international institutional sales at
Schroder Securities (Japan). ``By the afternoon, it was clear the
yen had broke through.''
   Share prices advanced across the board, but only a moderate 600
million shares changed hands on the market's first section.
   ``This implies there's a lot of selling still to be done,''
Muller said.
   In bond dealings, benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bonds closed at 87.40 points, up from Thursday's close of 86.47
points. Their yield fell to 7.080 percent from 7.275 percent.

<HEAD>Rain Dampens New England; Snow Falls in Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A winterlike storm continued to dump snow on Michigan early
today, and rain fell in northern New England.
   The snow that fell in Upper Michigan was part of a storm that
has brought record spring snowfall to the Great Lakes region since
late Wednesday.
   Snow accumulations Thursday ranged from a trace in central
Illinois to 4 inches in Chicago's northwest suburbs to more than a
foot in some high points on Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Eight
inches piled up in Michigan's Marquette, Negaunee and Ishpeming
counties, and 12.8 inches fell at Marquette's airport.
   Up to 8 inches of snow fell in eastern Wisconsin. Dozens of
schools were closed throughout the state, and two deaths and
hundreds of traffic accidents were reported during the Thursday
morning rush hour when snow was heaviest.
   Elsewhere Thursday, high winds were blamed for a death in
central North Carolina. A 50-year-old man was mowing his lawn when
a large tree fell on him, authorities said.
   Tornadoes touched down in Florida near Cape Coral, Fort Myers
and Miami. Thunderstorm winds gusted to 55 mph at Norfolk, Va.
   Showers and thunderstorms rumbled over central New England, much
of New York state, eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware,
eastern Virginia, parts of the Carolinas and southern Florida.
Showers and thunderstorms also developed in central California,
western Nevada, western Montana and the Idaho Panhandle. Rain
dampened eastern Indiana and western Ohio.
   Today's forecast called for thunderstorms in Texas, southern
Oklahoma and Kansas. Rain was forecast for Wyoming to Missouri, and
showers were expected in Pennsylvania, New York and Vermont.
   The nation's high Thursday was 98 degrees at Bullhead City,
Ariz., and Presidio, Texas.

<HEAD>Detroit Releases Red Squad Surveillance Files</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered the release of files on about
1.5 million people, including the city's current mayor, who were
spied on by the police department's Red Squad before it was
abolished in 1974.
   Activists said release of the documents ordered Thursday would
lay to rest an era of ``social paranoia,'' when activists were
targeted by Detroit police surveillance.
   The Rev. William Cunningham, director of the human rights group
Focus:HOPE in Detroit, said he looked forward to seeing his file.
   ``I'll pursue it out of curiosity and to see what they've got on
me,'' said Cunningham. ``It was social paranoia, another chapter of
McCarthyism.''
   Wayne County Circuit Judge Lucile Watts ordered the city to
allot $750,000 to the Red Squad Notification and Distribution
Compliance Program. The program will hire 65 employees to field
calls and letters from people seeking to learn if they were spied
upon.
   ``Because they spoke out, they were spied on. The 1.5 million
people were not trying to overthrow the state of Michigan,'' said
Richard Soble, an attorney representing the plaintiffs.
   Mayor Coleman Young opposed the Red Squad, which had existed
since the 1940s, and shut it down after taking office in 1974.
However, he wanted to destroy the files, which are contained in 40
cabinets crammed into a a small office in downtown Detroit.
   Civil rights activists sued to gain access to the files.
   Young, a civil rights and labor activist for decades before his
election, features prominently in the files, which include minutes
of meetings that Young attended, said Police Commissioner Roy Levy
Williams.
   ``These meetings talked about the Pentagon being a deterrent to
the American objectives by stealing too much from the budget,''
Williams said. ``Anything like that with criticism of the status
quo, those folks wanted to know what was being said to protect the
common good.''
   Williams said the city was satisfied with the settlement.

<TEXT>
   After squirming on the witness stand and
sobbing in her father's arms, the first child witness in Raymond
Buckey's retrial repeatedly said she couldn't remember if she was
molested at the McMartin preschool.
   ``I don't remember if it happened or not,'' the 11-year-old said
when asked if Buckey touched her sexually.
   At the conclusion of cross-examination, Buckey's lawyer, Danny
Davis, asked the girl whether she was sodomized.
   ``I don't remember,'' she said.
   The 31-year-old Buckey is charged specifically with raping the
girl and using a foreign object to sodomize her.
   Clutching a stuffed toy snake, she initially expressed her
unwillingness to take the stand Thursday. Then, the youngster said
she had a stomachache, left the stand and went into a hallway where
she sat sobbing in her father's arms.
   The parents and prosecutors spent an hour with her in private,
and she finally returned to finish her testimony.
   On Wednesday she had said she was neither sodomized nor raped by
Buckey when she attended his family's nursery school in Manhattan
Beach.
   Another change in her testimony came when Deputy District
Attorney Pam Ferrero read to the child sections of her own
testimony before a grand jury and a preliminary hearing six years
ago. The transcripts indicated the girl had used anatomically
explicit dolls to show that she was raped and sodomized.
   She was then asked whether Buckey hurt her sexually.
   ``I don't recall but I remember it did happen,'' she said.
   Ms. Ferrero asked no further questions to clarify the answer.
   On cross-examination by Davis, the youngster said repeatedly she
could not remember giving any of the earlier testimony nor whether
any of the events she related happened.
   She also could not remember that she once described a female
teacher as lying on top of her nude and women teachers playing
``naked games.''
   ``I can't remember,'' she answered repeatedly.
   Charges against five female teachers, stemming in part from
those allegations, were dismissed after the preliminary hearing for
lack of evidence.
   The first Buckey trial, the longest and costliest criminal
proceeding in U.S. history, ended in January with Buckey acquitted
of 40 counts of molestation at the family-owned preschool. His
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, was acquitted of 12 charges.
   But the jury deadlocked on 13 counts against Buckey, and the
district attorney decided to retry him on eight of those charges
involving three children.
   The girl who testified Thursday did not appear at the first
trial, and the jury deadlocked 11-1 for acquittal on the two
charges which involved her.
   Ms. Ferrero acknowledged in court that the girl did not want to
come to court at all Thursday, but her parents brought her anyway.
   Ms. Ferrero said the girl expressed the desire not to testify
when she arrived but ``was trying to be cheerful'' and agreed to
cooperate.
   She said it was difficult to remember events that occurred when
she was 3 or 4 years old. She will be 12 in July.

   The dollar continued its slide against the

   Spot gold prices were driven sharply lower under the pressure of
Japanese selling.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 154.15 yen, down 2.60 yen from
Thursday's close. Later in London, it was quoted at 153.99 yen.

<HEAD>Mongolian Legislature Debates Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mongolia's legislature today debated proposals to
allow direct presidential elections and create a second legislative
chamber to meet year-round, according to sources in that country's
capital, Ulan Bator.
   Both changes are supported by Mongolia's fledgling opposition
parties, founded during the winter to press for democratic reforms
like those being implemented in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   In a speech Thursday, however, President Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat
proposed that the legislature, known as the Great People's Hural,
continue to elect the president.
   He supported the idea of creating a smaller body that would be
made of up Great Hural members and would meet frequently, said the
sources, who spoke by telephone from the Mongolian capital.
   The Great Hural, with 370 deputies, generally meets only once or
twice a year. More than 93 percent of its deputies belong to the
ruling Communist party, formally called the Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party.
   The opposition says indirect presidential elections help
perpetuate Communist control of the government.
   Also being debated today was a law that would legalize the new
opposition parties and give them at least nominally equal status
with the ruling party.

<TEXT>
   A jury sentenced a former burglar to nine
years in prison for poisoning the historic Treaty Oak tree in what
authorities said was an occult ritual to purge his feelings for a
woman.
   The attorney for Paul Stedman Cullen, 46, who faced a possible
life sentence, had pleaded with the jury that less than 10 years
would be a fair sentence.
   ``You have to decide how much a tree is worth,'' said attorney
Terry Kirk, who recalled playing as a child under the branches of
the centuries-old tree.
   Cullen had faced the harsh sentence for the criminal mischief
conviction because of his previous felony burglary conviction.
   Cullen had no comment as he was led from the courtroom.
   The tree, estimated to be as much as 500 years old, was poisoned
with the powerful liquid herbicide Velpar in early 1989. About
two-thirds of the tree is now dead, foresters said, but the
remaining third is still producing leaves.
   According to legend, the tree was the site of a treaty signing
between Stephen F. Austin and Indians.
   Prosecutors said Cullen poisoned the tree to protect a woman
whom he liked and to ``kill'' his love for her.
   Kirk said the jury withstood extreme community pressure not to
severely punish Cullen.
   ``I honestly do believe ... that there are people out there (who
would) make him drink Velpar, hang him,'' Kirk said.
   State District Judge Bob Perkins, who presided over the trial,
said people still find ``this crime unfathomable in terms of
rationale _ nobody can figure it out. It makes it that much more of
a crime.''
   Perkins said he would take off about a year from the sentence
because of time Cullen has spent in jail. He has been jailed in

   Since the poisoning was discovered, more than $100,000 has been
donated to save the tree. Velpar-contaminated dirt was removed from
around its roots, the tree has been doused with spring water and
elaborate sun screens were built to shade it.

   A 2-year-old child allegedly beaten to
death eight weeks after his adoption should never have been taken
from the home where people loved him, his former foster parents
said.
   Dale and Jan May had cared for Maurice West in their Cincinnati
home since he was 2 months old. They wanted to adopt Maurice, whom
they called ``Reecie,'' but were turned down because he was black
and they were white.
   This week, the Mays came to Rochester to attend the trial of the
couple who adopted Maurice, and to hear testimony about the
battered child who died just two months after he left their home.
   Maurice's adoptive parents, Bernice and Gerald Kittelberger, are
charged with second-degree manslaughter and assault for Maurice's
Aug. 26, 1989, death. Closing arguments in the case are scheduled
for Monday.
   Maurice was ``a beautiful baby,'' Dale May said Thursday outside
a Monroe County courtroom while leafing through photographs of a
smiling, laughing little boy.
   Another set of photographs, those introduced as evidence in the
Kittelbergers' trial, show a child covered with bruises, burns and
scars.
   Medical experts testified that Maurice had been beaten
repeatedly and severely with a blunt object. A doctor who examined
Maurice's body in the emergency room of St. Mary's Hospital said
the child's limbs were so swollen that he could not find a vein to
inject intravenous medicine.
   Mrs. Kittelberger said the child had choked on oatmeal.
   Monroe County Medical Examiner Nicholas T. Forbes said the death
was a direct result of the beatings.
   In statements to police, the Kittelbergers _ who are black _
said they had hit the child with a belt, a paddle and a stick
wrapped in tape because he had resisted toilet training.
   They attributed other injuries _ an open gash on his forehead, a
tear near his buttocks, burn marks on his hands _ to the child
tripping and falling, or accidentally grabbing Mrs. Kittelberger's
hot curling iron.
   But the Mays said Maurice was not that kind of child.
   ``While Reecie was at our house, he was allowed to go
anywhere,'' May said. ``In two years, there were no accidents. No
tripping, no falls, no anything.''
   By age 2, Maurice was coordinated enough to play computer games
and an electronic keyboard and knew how to run their videocassette
recorder, Mrs. May said.
   ``He was smart enough and careful enough that he could turn it
on,'' she said. ``You never had to worry about Reecie touching
anything, getting into anything or bothering anything.''
   Maurice never needed to be scolded or punished, the Mays said.
   ``An explanation to that child was enough,'' May said. ``A `no,
that will hurt you,' was enough.''
   The Mays, who have cared for 20 black and biracial foster
children over the last three years, applied to Hamilton County,
Ohio, officials to adopt Maurice.
   They told adoption officials that they would enroll Maurice in
an integrated school district, and that they would take African
culture classes so he would not lose his heritage. They said they
would adopt another black child, so that Maurice would not feel
isolated when he grew older.
   ``We did every single possible thing to make what we thought was
a good environment for Reecie,'' Mrs. May said. ``And when they
said we couldn't have him, we did everything we could to make his
adoption as easy as possible.''
   The Mays said they hope Kittelbergers are convicted and
sentenced to maximum prison terms for destroying Maurice's life.
The Kittelbergers face a maximum of 15 years in prison if convicted
of the second-degree manslaughter and assault charges.
   Moreover, the Mays are angry with the system that took Maurice
from them and brought him to Rochester.
   They want to see better investigations of adoptive parents and
better monitoring to prevent child abuse. And they want to see
arbitrary policies against cross-racial adoptions abolished.
   ``Love and a wholesome, happy environment is important, not just
black and white,'' Mrs. May said.

   Lava again started pouring from Kilauea
Volcano, but it's too early to tell it posed another threat to this
coastal community that has been devastated by molten rock,
authorities said.
   After a three-day respite, lava resumed flowing Thursday from a
vent along the volcano's east rift zone, said Hawaii County civil
defense spokesman Bruce Butts.
   Surface activity was spotted at the 1,800-foot level during a
overflight by scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian
Volcano Observatory, Butts said.
   The activity was about five miles away from Kalapana, which has
lost more than 60 houses to lava during the past six weeks, he said.
   Although the outpouring of lava stopped earlier this week,
molten rock had continued to flow down the volcano, through
Kalapana and into the ocean.
   However, no lava movement was seen in Kalapana on Thursday,
Butts said.
   Kilauea's latest eruption began Jane. 3, 1983, and since then,
lava flows have destroyed 139 houses, causing an estimated $61
million damage to private and public property.

<TEXT>
   Sammy Davis Jr.'s health has
deteriorated steadily since the cancer-stricken entertainer left a
hospital eight weeks ago to recuperate at home, according to his
friends.
   Publicist Susan Reynolds would only say Davis was ``resting''
and ``there has been no change.'' But friends said the
song-and-dance man was emaciated and obviously losing his battle
with throat cancer.
   Davis' weight has dropped to about 60 pounds and he was in a
fetal position, a source close to the entertainer told The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The source said he'd be
surprised if the entertainer lived another week.
   Reynolds would not comment on the report.
   Another source close to the family, who also requested
anonymity, said Davis could hardly utter a word because of a
tracheotomy performed in connection with his throat cancer, which
was diagnosed in September.
   The source told the AP that stars visiting Davis come away
``heartsick,'' some in tears.
   Davis, 64, was released from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on
March 13 to recuperate at home. He was admitted mid-January for
treatment of a gum infection and doctors later found that he had a
recurrence of throat cancer. No further chemotherapy was planned.
   Davis was honored Sunday at a testimonial dinner by the Friends
of the Israel Defense Forces. In her brief acceptance, Davis' wife,
Altovise, said: ``To try and say thank you is almost impossible. We
are so grateful. This is quite an honor.''

   South African President F.W. de Klerk promised
reforms and pressed for an end to sanctions against his country
during the first visit to the French presidential palace by any
South African leader since 1947.
   ``The mere fact that I met with (French officials) was a
recognition of the totally changed situation in South Africa,'' he
declared after an hourlong meeting Thursday with President Francois
Mitterrand.
   De Klerk said that because of those political changes, France
was prepared to discuss easing sanctions against South Africa with
its European partners.
   ``Sanctions are crumbling,'' de Klerk told a news conference on
the first full day of a nine-nation, 18-day trip to Western Europe.
   Mitterrand's spokesman, Hubert Vedrine, said de Klerk told
Mitterrand that sanctions were no longer justified.
   Vedrine also announced that Mitterrand would meet with Nelson
Mandela on June 7 when the African National Congress leader visits
Paris. Mandela opposes lifting sanctions.
   Mitterrand urged de Klerk to push for reform ``as rapidly as
possible,'' the spokesman said.
   De Klerk later traveled to Greece, where he was met at Athens
airport by Foreign Minister Antonis Samaras. De Klerk was to meet
with government officials today, rest over the weekend, and fly to
Portugal on Monday.
   French officials have depicted themselves as in the middle
regarding sanctions against South Africa, with Britain on one side
favoring the rapid lifting of sanctions while Denmark and the
Netherlands oppose any easing of restrictions now.
   Mitterrand and other Western leaders agreed to begin easing
South Africa's isolation after de Klerk in February ordered
Mandela's release from prison after 27 years and lifted a 30-year
ban on the ANC.
   Mandela and de Klerk agreed during talks last week to work
together to end political violence and clear the way for formal
negotiations on a new constitution that would extend voting rights
to South Africa's black majority.
   De Klerk said he told Mitterrand and Premier Michel Rocard the
changes in South Africa were irreversible. He said remaining
discriminatory laws were due for repeal or modification by the next
session of Parliament.
   ``There is no turning back,'' he said. ``South Africa will get a
new constitution that will be fair to all South Africa... it will
recognize the concept of full citizenship for all.''
   He described his talks with the French leaders as warm and
positive. He also said he discussed with Mitterrand the possibility
of cooperation in promoting economic development in Africa.
   De Klerk also plans stops in Belgium, Britain, West Germany,
Switzerland, Spain and Italy. It is the most extensive foreign
mission by a South African head of state since the National Party
took power in 1948.
   The last South African head of state to visit the Elysee Palace
was Jan Smuts in 1947. The highest-level official meeting since
then was in 1970, between prime ministers John Vorster of South
Africa and Jacques Chaban-Delmas of France.

   Two attackers shot and killed a retired
officer acquitted in two human rights cases, riddling him with
automatic gunfire as he sat in a taxi in downtown Santiago, police
said.
   The assassins, young men in high-school uniforms, shot National
Police Col. Luis Fontaine Manriquez, 56, at point-blank range
Thursday as he sat in the back seat of the taxi at an intersection,
police said.
   Fontaine was hit 18 times, acting Interior Minister Belisario
Velasco told a news conference.
   A woman aide riding with Fontaine, Margarita Moreno, was wounded
but was expected to recover, said Gen. Oscar Tapia, National Police
commander for Santiago.
   The cabbie took Fontaine to the National Police Hospital, where
the colonel was pronounced dead on arrival.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
   On March 21, two gunmen severely wounded a former air force
commander and military junta member, Gen. Gustavo Leigh, along with
a business partner, former air force Gen. Enrique Ruiz. A faction
of the pro-Communist Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, Chile's main
leftist guerrilla group, claimed responsibility for that attempt.
   In a communique mailed to news media, which arrived Thursday,
the Manuel Rodriguez Front said ``popular justice'' was justified
because military officers suspected of rights abuse still enjoyed
impunity. It named some leading army and navy officials but did not
mention Fontaine.
   In a written statement Thursday evening, the government of
President Patricio Aylwin called the latest attack ``an act of
extreme cruelty'' and said the killers ``are people stubbornly
seeking to alter the process of democratic reconstruction in the
country.''
   At government request, the Santiago Court of Appeal appointed a
special judge to investigate.
   Fontaine was deputy commander of DICOMCAR, a secretive branch of
the National Police involved in rooting out dissidents under the
military regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, which ended two months
ago.
   Fontaine was tried and acquitted in the 1985 assassination of
three members of the then-outlawed Communist Party, whose bodies
were found with their throats slit. He also was tried and acquitted
in the 1986 torture-killing of a student allegedly involved in a
leftist guerrilla group.
   Last week, he called a news conference and denied involvement in
atrocities.

<TEXT>
   Ten years after its massive eruption, there is a
50-50 chance Mount St. Helens will explode its dome again within
three decades, a University of Washington seismologist says.
   Steve Malone, a geophysics professor on a team monitoring the
Pacific Northwest, said Thursday that Mount St. Helens is the most
likely volcano in the Cascade Mountains to erupt in the next 20 to
30 years.
   ``Our capabilities for monitoring volcanoes have improved since
Mount St. Helens erupted,'' he said.
   Malone said seismic activity, which the predication is largely
based on, is a good barometer of eruptive potential because it
indicates the breaking of rock below the earth's surface as molten
material rises underneath the volcano.
   The probability of eruption increases with the frequency and
magnitude of the earthquakes, he said.
   The May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens killed 57 people,
devastated a vast area and lofted a huge ash cloud that circled the
globe.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Slumped 0.6 Percent in April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales slumped 0.6 percent in April,
posting the second consecutive monthly decline and the biggest
setback in six months, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said sales fell by $907 million last
month to a seasonally adjusted $148.64 billion.
   The April decrease was a disappointment to economists, who had
been looking for a small rebound following a 0.2 percent decline in
March and no change in February.
   Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total
economic activity, continued weakness in the area of retail sales
was likely to intensify concerns about the country's future
economic prospects, especially in light of last week's report that
unemployment climbed in April to 5.4 percent.
   Growing joblessness could promote worries among consumers about
the future, causing them to shut off spending, especially for
big-ticket items such as autos.
   The 0.6 percent April decline was the largest since a 1.4
percent plunge last October.
   The back-to-back declines in March and April marked the first
time that has occurred in moe than three years.
   Originally, the government reported February posted a sales
decline as well but sales activity during that month was revised
upward in the current report to show no change.
   For April, the biggest drag on activity came from auto sales,
which dropped 2.7 percent. It marked the sixth time in the last
seven months that car sales have fallen.
   Without the big drop in auto sales, total retail sales would
have been unchanged last month.
   Sales at general department stores were off 0.7 percent in April
following an even bigger 1.2 percent drop in March. A survey
focusing only on the country's largest chain department stores
showed sales had generally rebounded in April, when compared to a
year ago, boosted by late Easter shopping.
   Sales at hardware and building supply stores dropped 2.6 percent
in April following an 0.8 percent decrease the previous month.
   There was basic weakness across the board. Sales at gasoline
stations fell by 1 percent, restaurant sales were off by 0.2
percent while sales at speciality clothing stores were down 1.9
percent.
   Drug stores were the only retail establishments showing an
increase, a gain of 1.2 percent.

   Pauline Frederick, an award-winning broadcast
reporter who helped pave the way for women in journalism, has died
at the age of 84.
   Frederick, whose married name was Pauline Frederick Robbins,
died Wednesday after suffering a heart attack in suburban Lake
Forest, where she was visiting relatives.
   ``She was the first full-fledged woman correspondent and opened
doors for women's acceptance in television and radio journalism,''
said Beryl Pfizer, a news producer at NBC who worked with
Frederick. ``And beside that, she was a heckuva person.''
   Frederick, born in Gallitzin, Pa., worked for five years as an
ABC correspondent before moving in 1953 to NBC, where she served as
United Nations correspondent for 21 years. At the UN, she covered
events including the Cuban missile crisis and China's entrance into
the United Nations.
   Frederick once came to the office from a diplomatic dinner,
dressed in a black evening dress, to update reports on a situation
in a foreign country with information she gathered at the dinner,
Pfizer recalled Thursday.
   In 1976 she moderated the second presidential debate between
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, the first woman journalist to
moderate a presidential debate.
   She was the first woman to be elected president of the United
Nations Correspondents Association and was also the first of her
sex to receive a George Foster Peabody Award for achievements in
broadcasting.
   In 1980, Frederick became the first woman to receive the highest
award of the Radio-Television News Directors Association.
   Later in her career, she worked as an international affairs
analyst for National Public Radio.
   Frederick received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in
international law from American University in Washington, D.C.
   She was married to the late Charles Robbins, former reporter and
managing editor of The Wall Street Journal. She has no immediate
survivors.

<HEAD>Former Communists Blamed For Unification Fears in East Germany</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 9 grafs to UPDATE with West German spokesman
blaming Communists for labor unrest. Pickup 6th pvs, ``The
Germanys...''</NOTE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's former Communists are inciting
unrest among workers who fear they will lose their jobs as the
nation unites with West Germany, a West German official charged
today.
   Tens of thousands of teachers, textile workers and farmers
staged brief protests and strikes on Thursday to demand protection
from the widespread unemployment expected as East Germany moves to
a free market.
   Hans Klein, spokesman for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
said the organizers of the strikes ``are to some extent exactly the
forces who caused'' East Germany's dire economic problems.
   Klein told a news conference in the West German capital, Bonn,
that there was legitimate ``uncertainty and fear'' over the talks
between the Germanys on the merger of their economies and social
institutions.
   Guenther Krause, who leads the East German delegation in
economic talks with West Germany, also criticized what he called a
``fear campaign by the left'' to trigger mass anxiety over the loss
of huge subsidies under the former socialist system.
   Krause made his comments to the East German Parliament on
Thursday while briefing lawmakers on the status of the unification
talks.
   Lawmaker Gregor Gysi, head of the reformed Communist Party,
blamed the East German government for the uncertainty among East
Germans.
   He said East Germans were being kept too much in the dark about
what was being negotiated and needed to plan for economic changes.
   He told lawmakers on Thursday that the East German negotiating
team has gone into talks in a ``stooped posture'' to the West
German delegation, which wants to remove all the vestiges of the
former socialist system.
   The Germanys are to merge their economies and social
institutions on July 2, when the West German mark is to become the
currency of East Germany.
   Full unification is expected next year, after the superpowers
find a way to agree on the strategic role of a united Germany.
   Krause said work on the final economic and social agreement
between the Germanys should be completed by Sunday. The parliaments
of both nations then would consider the treaty.
   In Bonn, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Thursday that
East Germany must restructure its beleaguered economy before the
two nations share the West German currency.
   Kohl also renewed his demand that East Germany be prepared to
start dismantling its 41-year-old system of state ownership if
economic union with West Germany is going to be a success.
   Economists predict that many inefficient East German factories
will close in the next year because they will not be able to
compete in the free market, and that between 500,000 and 2 million
East German workers will lose their jobs.
   Kohl and East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere say a
quick influx of Western investment will create new jobs and raise
East German living standards.
   The two governments still have differences over the level of job
and price guarantees to give East Germans.
   The talks are being held behind closed doors, and many questions
remain unanswered about how West Germany would absorb and dismantle
East Germany's vast public sector and social welfare system.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats, the junior partner in de
Maiziere's governing coalition, are pressing the conservative de
Maiziere to push for more social guarantees for East Germans used
to cheap housing, subsidized food and guaranteed jobs.
   Krause gave the 400-member Parliament an update on the status of
talks between the countries and a grim economic picture of the East
German economy.
   He said East Germany faces a year-end deficit of 120 billion
East German marks ($36.6 billion), inflation has risen rapidly in
recent months and only 32 percent of the nation's industries are
profitable.

   Rumors that China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping
was seriously ill or dead rippled through Asian financial markets
today, but the Foreign Ministry denied them.
   ``The so-called report is a sheer fabrication with ulterior
motives,'' the ministry said in a one-sentence statement.
   Officials traveling with visiting Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said the president was scheduled to meet with Deng on
Sunday morning, lending support to the Chinese denial.
   Tokyo markets did not react to the rumors perceptibly, but
brokers in Hong Kong blamed the rumors for a 24.96 point drop in
the Hang Seng Index, the stock market's key indicator of blue chips.
   Deng, 85, has not been seen in public since February, when he
met with a delegation from Hong Kong. He stepped down in March from
his last official post, as chairman of the government military
commission, and even before then had stopped routinely seeing
visitors.
   Chinese sources say Deng, a chain smoker, suffers from cancer.
He speaks with some difficulty and walks shakily.
   The government has refused to give details of his health.

   Three Japanese adventurers whose balloon
crashed and burned when they tried to float over Mount Everest
returned to Katmandu today in a safer manner _ aboard helicopters.
   Also today, an American ski instructor, an Australian and a
Swede climbed to the top of the world's highest mountain, bringing
to 21 the number of people who have scaled the peak in the last two
days.
   Co-pilot Saburo Ichiyoshi, 41, and cameramen Atsushi Saito, 27,
spent two nights at the accident site after the balloon crashed and
burned Wednesday in the Himalayas. The third balloonist, Michio
Kanda, 41, went in search of help.
   Ichiyoshi, who reportedly broke his leg in at least two places,
was brought to Katmandu from Tibet by Nepalese army helicopter and
rushed to a hospital.
   Saito and Kanda, who apparently were not injured, arrived aboard
a second helicopter.
   Colonel B.R. Pun, who piloted one of the rescue helicopters,
said the site was so high it was difficult to fly in. The altitude
was estimated at 16,400 feet above sea level.
   The expedition, the first to attempt a balloon flight over
Everest, set off from Nyalam, on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau,
and the balloon reached an altitude of about 32,000 feet one hour
into the flight, Kanda said.
   But the winds seemed unfavorable for crossing the 29,028
foot-high Mount Everest, he said. They began descending for an
emergency landing, looking for points where the expedition's rescue
teams would be, but the balloon suddenly hit a rock and caught fire.
   ``After hitting it, the balloon rolled down two, three, and
several times ... I did not know how many times. ... But it rolled
down until it reached in a valley,'' Kanda said.
   Meanwhile, Andre Lapkass, 31, a ski instructor from Estes Park,
Colo., reached the summit of Mount Everest today along with a
Swedish member of a New Zealand expedition, Michael Reutersward,
25, of Stockholm.
   They followed the route taken by five Americans and two Nepalese
sherpa guides who on Thursday scaled Everest's heights.
   Minutes after the American and Swede reached Everest's summit,
an Australian climber, Tim MacArtney Snape, 34, of Sydney,
accomplished the feat.
   On Thursday, three members of the New Zealand team including the
son of Everest's first conquerer, Sir Edmund Hillary, climbed the
mountain. The senior Hillary climbed Everest in 1953 with his

   Mayor John Daniels' younger brother has
pleaded guilty to selling cocaine and faces a likely five-year
prison term.
   Robert Daniels, 48, pleaded guilty Tuesday to sale of cocaine
and conspiracy to sell cocaine. As part of a plea agreement, New
Haven Superior Court Judge Richard A. Damiani said he probably
would sentence Daniels to 10 years in prison, suspended after five,
and probation for three years.
   Carol Smith, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said this morning that
he would not have any comment. At the time of his brother's arrest,
the mayor said he would not request leniency.
   Daniels is free on $25,000 bond and is seeking treatment in
Stamford for drug addiction.
   In February, just a little more than a month after the mayor
took office, his brother surrendered to a third brother, Melvin, a
New Haven police detective.

   A medical examiner's office has ruled
that the death of a 10-year-old girl who drowned while fishing with
her father and a younger sister was a homicide.
   Jeanette Lindsey died Feb. 27 at Lake Worth. Less than two weeks
earlier, her father, Wendell Lindsey, had bought life insurance
policies on her and her 9-year-old sister, Darlene, authorities
said.
   Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. Marc Krouse said that the case will
be presented to a Tarrant County grand jury but declined to comment
further. The examiner's office finding of homicide was made
Wednesday.
   ``We have been suspicious since right after it happened,'' said
police Sgt. Paul Kratz. He said the investigation was continuing.
   Lindsey told police he had sent Darlene to the car to get some
paper towels when Jeanette fell off a log and landed in the water.
He said she was underwater four to five minutes before he could
pull her to shore.
   Darlene said she heard a scream and ran back to the road and
flagged down a passing car.
   When police arrived, they found a crying Lindsey holding
Jeanette and saying, ``I've lost my baby.'' Authorities said the
water at the site was only about knee deep.
   Fort Worth police confirmed that Lindsey had purchased $50,000
life insurance policies on each of his daughters less than two
weeks before Jeanette's death. Police said the policies carried
double indemnity clauses in the event of accidental death, meaning
that he would have collected $100,000 if either of the girls died
in an accident.
   Asked for comment on the medical examiner's finding, Lindsey,
33, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, ``I'd really rather not go
into it.''
   Lindsey has filed a $100,000 claim against the city, alleging
that the city was negligent because city personnel did not properly
attempt to resuscitate the girl and that certain unspecified
equipment was not kept in good repair.

   A South African spy
organization put cholera germs in drinking water to disrupt
elections in Namibia as part of sabotage operations in Africa and
Europe, a newspaper reported today.
   Vrye Weekblad, a weekly Afrikaans language newspaper, said a
former official of the Civilian Cooperation Bureau said in an
interview the unit had cells in black African nations and Europe
and planned killings of anti-apartheid activists.
   The South African government is conducting an investigation into
the Civilian Cooperation Bureau and allegations that police and
military operatives killed anti-apartheid activists. Several former
police officers have claimed they were involved in killing
activists.
   Vrye Weekblad, which helped uncover the first public details
about the bureau, said it obtained further information in an
interview with former bureau official Petrus Jacobus Botes, who
said he headed the unit's activities in Mozambique and Swaziland.
   Botes said Civilian Cooperation Bureau activities ranged from
murder and sabotage to bombings, bribery and blackmail, the
newspaper reported.
   Botes claimed his unit was instructed to killed South African
Communist Party chief Joe Slovo, then in exile in Zambia, the
article said. It did not say if any attempt was made on Slovo's
life.
   The newspaper said Botes claimed that bureau operatives put
cholera germs in drinking water at the Dobra refugee camp in
Namibia in 1989 as part of efforts to disrupt the South West
African Peoples' Organization's election campaign. The story did
not say how this was intended to disrupt the election.
   The organization, known as SWAPO, waged a guerrilla campaign
against South African rule of the territory before winning the
elections. Namibia became independent in March.
   Botes, according to the newspaper, also claimed the Civilian
Cooperation Bureau planned to kill SWAPO activist Hidipo Hamutenya,
who is now minister of information in the Namibian government. It
did not say if any attempt was made.
   The article says the bureau ran destabilization operations in
black African nations, with units or cells based in Malawi,
Zimbabwe, Zaire and other nations. It said the unit attempted to
influence recent elections in Zimbabwe.
   The article also says that Botes informed Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok in August, 1989 about bureau activities after he was
involved in a dispute with the group's leaders about expenses.
   He also said there was a bomb attempt against him.
   A police spokesman in Pretoria had no immediate response today
to the report.
   Top government officials have denied any knowledge about the
Civilian Cooperation Bureau. The group allegedly used civilians or
police officers to kill government opponents and disrupt
anti-government activities.
   Bureau activities, according to testimony given to the
government inquiry, ranged from killing activists to using a
baboon's fetus to put a magic spell on Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

   Three Japanese adventurers whose balloon
crashed and burned when they tried to float over Mount Everest
returned to Katmandu today in a safer manner _ aboard helicopters.
   Also today, an American ski instructor, an Australian and a
Swede climbed to the top of the world's highest mountain, bringing
to 21 the number of people who have scaled the peak in the last two
days.
   Co-pilot Saburo Ichiyoshi, 41, and cameramen Atsushi Saito, 27,
spent two nights at the accident site after the balloon crashed and
burned Wednesday in the Himalayas. The third balloonist, Michio
Kanda, 41, went in search of help.
   Ichiyoshi, who reportedly broke his leg in at least two places,
was brought to Katmandu from Tibet by Nepalese army helicopter and
rushed to a hospital.
   Saito and Kanda, who apparently were not injured, arrived aboard
a second helicopter.
   Colonel B.R. Pun, who piloted one of the rescue helicopters,
said the site was so high it was difficult to fly in. The altitude
was estimated at 16,400 feet above sea level.
   The expedition, the first to attempt a balloon flight over
Everest, set off from Nyalam, on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau,
and the balloon reached an altitude of about 32,000 feet one hour
into the flight, Kanda said.
   But the winds seemed unfavorable for crossing the 29,028
foot-high Mount Everest, he said. They began descending for an
emergency landing, looking for points where the expedition's rescue
teams would be, but the balloon suddenly hit a rock and caught fire.
   ``After hitting it, the balloon rolled down two, three, and
several times ... I did not know how many times. ... But it rolled
down until it reached in a valley,'' Kanda said.
   Meanwhile, Andre Lapkass, 31, a ski instructor from Estes Park,
Colo., reached the summit of Mount Everest today along with a
Swedish member of a New Zealand expedition, Michael Reutersward,
25, of Stockholm.
   They followed the route taken by five Americans and two Nepalese
sherpa guides who on Thursday scaled Everest's heights.
   Minutes after the American and Swede reached Everest's summit,
an Australian climber, Tim MacArtney Snape, 34, of Sydney,
accomplished the feat.
   On Thursday, three members of the New Zealand team including the
son of Everest's first conquerer, Sir Edmund Hillary, climbed the
mountain. The senior Hillary climbed Everest in 1953 with his
Nepalese guide Tenzing Norgay.
   In all, 18 men reached Everest's peak on Thursday alone.
   The traffic on Everest has raised questions about the effect
mountain climbing has on the fragile ecology of the pristine
Himalayan Range. An estimated two tons of garbage _ left by

<HEAD>Report: Waldheim Apologizes For Misleading Israel on Nazi Army
Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Austrian President Kurt Waldheim apologized to
Israel in an interview published today for misleading statements
about his German army service in World War II, but again denied
that he committed war crimes.
   Waldheim also was quoted as urging Israel to upgrade its
diplomatic representation in Vienna and to return the ambassador it
withdrew in protest after Waldheim's election in 1986.
   ``In the past years my hand has been extended, and it has always
remained hanging in the air,'' Waldheim said in an appeal to the
Jewish state.
   His interview, conducted Monday in Vienna, was published today
in the liberal Haaretz newspaper.
   A spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry said no official
message of this kind has reached Jerusalem, but it was unlikely
that Israel would return its ambassador to Vienna.
   Waldheim reiterated that he has not been involved in war crimes.
``The accusations against me are completely baseless,'' he told the
newspaper.
   Waldheim was referring to allegations that he was involved in
the massacre of Yugoslavian partisans and the deportation of Greek
Jews to Nazi death camps. About 45,000 Greek Jews were sent to Nazi
death camps while Waldheim was stationed in the Balkans.
   A 1988 investigation by six historians said there was no
evidence Waldheim had directly taken part in Nazi war crimes, but
said his assertions that he did not know about the fate of Jews
deported from Greece were ``not believable.''
   In his official biography, Waldheim claimed he left the German
army after being wounded on the Russian front in 1941.
   He later admitted he had omitted from the biography being
reassigned to the Balkans where he served as an intelligence
officer until the end of the war.
   ``I apologize that I did not bring up the Balkan matter. I
confess that there was a mistake here,'' Waldheim said. ``I did not
forsee that the issue would open in such a tragic direction.''
   ``I certainly express my regret before them on the ommissions,''
he said in an appeal to the Jewish state.
   Waldheim also dismissed recent reports that he had once declared
himself to be a ``loyal Nazi.''
   ``To say I was a member of the Nazi Party is not correct.
Despite what was claimed, I never admitted this,'' he said.
   Waldheim said he wanted to improve his relationship with Jews
and Jewish organizations around the world which have been at the
forefront of investigations into his past.
   Waldheim suggested that the investigations were caused by Jewish
anger over decisions taken by the United Nations while he served as
U.N. secretary general from 1972 to 1982. He cited as an example
the 1975 resolution equating Zionism with racism.
   ``The Jewish community accused me of supporting the resolution.
That simply was not correct,'' he said. ``The decision was
regretful, unjust and damaging, at least to the United Nations.''

   Ten years after its massive eruption, there is a
50-50 chance Mount St. Helens will explode its dome again within
three decades, a University of Washington seismologist says.
   Steve Malone, a geophysics professor on a team monitoring the
Pacific Northwest, said Thursday that Mount St. Helens is the most
likely volcano in the Cascade Mountains to erupt in the next 20 to
30 years.
   ``Our capabilities for monitoring volcanoes have improved since
Mount St. Helens erupted,'' he said.
   Malone said seismic activity, which the predication is largely
based on, is a good barometer of eruptive potential because it
indicates the breaking of rock below the earth's surface as molten
material rises underneath the volcano.
   The probability of eruption increases with the frequency and
magnitude of the earthquakes, he said.
   The May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens killed 57 people,
devastated a vast area and lofted a huge ash cloud that circled the
globe.

<HEAD>Police Break Up Anti-Base Rallies; Arrest in Slaying of Americans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police arrested 30 people today
during rallies by Filipinos who want the government to refuse to
extend the leases on six U.S. military bases when they expire next
year.
   Meanwhile, a police official announced the arrest of a Communist
rebel leader accused in the slayings of three Americans and a
Filipino of American descent outside the U.S.-run Clark Air Base in
1987.
   In Manila, Brig. Gen. Marino Filart said a special 500-man
security force will guard U.S. and Filipino officials who begin
talks Monday on the future of the six U.S. bases, whose lease
expires in September 1991.
   Rafael Alunan, spokesman for the Filipino delegation, told
reporters the exploratory phase of the talks could be concluded
within a week, and the two sides would then decide whether to begin
formal negotiations.
   The United States maintains about 40,000 troops, Defense
Department civilians and military dependents at the six bases,
which U.S. officials say are crucial to stability in the Far East.
   President Corazon Aquino has not yet indicated whether she
supports extending the lease. Most surveys show that bases
supporters outnumber opponents but that a growing number of
Filipinos believe the American facilities infringe on national
sovereignty.
   In Manila, police said two people were arrested today when
club-wielding police broke up an anti-base rally by about 150
University of the Philippines students in front of the U.S. Embassy.
   Later, 200 leftist students burned tires and set off
firecrackers along a main Manila street to demand the closure of
the U.S. bases.
   In Davao, 600 miles south of Manila, witnesses said 28 people
were arrested after protesters splashed red paint on a U.S.
Information Service office.
   Meanwhile, about 3,000 residents of Olongapo, site of the U.S.
Subic Bay Naval Base, 50 miles west of Manila, held a rally
supporting the U.S. bases and protesting last week's killing of a
U.S. Marine sergeant.
   Several American servicemen in bars and clubs cheered the
pro-base demonstrators, who included bar girls and merchants who
closed their shops to join the rally organized by city officials.
   The killing of Marine Sgt. John Fredette, of Buena Park, Calif.,
caused a slump in the city's economy after U.S. military
authorities restricted personnel to the Subic base for several days
due to security concerns.
   Police say Fredette's slaying was non-political and might have
resulted from a robbery attempt. Police are holding three suspects
on charges of murder and illegal gun possession.
   A police official ruled out any link between Fredette's slaying
and the arrest of a Communist rebel leader who is accused of being
involved in a coordinated series of attacks against Americans in
the city of Angeles outside the U.S.-run Clark Air Base in October
1987.
   Provincial rebel chief Alex Capitulo, 33, was arrested Tuesday
at a restaurant in the town of Guagua, 35 miles north of Manila,
the military said.
   Capitulo is suspected of involvement in the killings of U.S. Air
Force Sgt. Randy Davis, of Portland, Ore., Airman 1st Class Steven
Faust, of Pasadena, Texas, Herculano Mangante, a retired Air Force
sergeant living near the base, and Joseph Porter, a Filipino
businessman of American descent.
   U.S. intelligence sources say they were apparently killed in
reprisal for American troops taking Filipino soldiers wounded in a
battle with Communist rebels to the base hospital.

<HEAD>Millions More In HUD Losses Reported; Favoritism Alleged</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Top three grafs new to say losses probably higher than $177
million; pickup graf 3 pvs, The investigation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The government probably will lose more than
$177 million on a housing program used for developments alongside
golf courses and marinas, say internal reports blaming the risky
loans on mismanagement and political favoritism.
   The government already has lost $55 million on sales of
foreclosed properties from the Department of Housing and Urban
Development's Title X land development program, agency auditors
said. They said it will cost an additional $122 million if failures
and foreclosure sales continue at current rates.
   Declining values of some of the properties and delays in
foreclosing and selling the troubled projects ``may further add to
HUD's losses,'' the auditors said. So far, HUD has had to pay
claims on 32 of the 65 loans made through the program. Seventeen of
the projects are still in the formative stages, ``thus the final
claim rate ... likely will be higher.''
   The investigation, detailed in two reports completed last week,
found several examples of projects being approved despite
overwhelming evidence they did not meet requirements or were too
risky.
   Also detailed were several previously undisclosed cases in which
former HUD officials or Republican consultants successfully lobbied
senior department managers to reverse lower-level rejections of
questionable projects. Some of the projects have failed and others
are troubled, the reports said.
   The reports, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act,
blamed the problems on Reagan-era abuses but said the losses
continued to mount last year because HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who
took office with the Bush administration, had not allocated enough
staff to the program.
   After prodding by HUD's inspector general, or internal watchdog,
Kemp last week created a new unit to handle the program. Kemp
killed Title X last year but the existing projects still must be
monitored.
   Several Title X projects were built alongside golf courses and
include other resort-like amenities. Few catered to low- and
moderate-income families.
   One development reviewed, Bluewater Bay in Niceville, Fla.,
received $15.4 million in HUD-backed financing.
   The complex, which had additional private financing, includes
tennis courts, bike and hiking trails, a swimming pool,
restaurants, a shopping center, 27 holes of golf, a beach and a
120-slip marina.
   Bluewater Bay was approved in April 1989, two months after Kemp
took office, despite regulations that say: ``Land development
proposals oriented to recreation-resort housing markets are not
eligible.''
   HUD General Counsel Francis Keating said Bluewater Bay was
funded because HUD had entered into a binding contract in February
1989, just weeks after Kemp took office and before he named most of
his top aides.
   ``These kind of proposals could not and would not be approved on
Jack Kemp's watch,'' Keating said.
   Among former HUD officials successful in lobbying was Shirley
McVay Wiseman, who in congressional testimony last summer
criticized the role of politics during her tenure at the agency.
   It was Wiseman who first cast doubt on assertions by former HUD
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. that he played no direct role in
funding decisions.
   Since then, others have testified that Pierce was involved. He
and several former top aides are being investigated by a
court-appointed special prosecutor.
   The new audit reports said Wiseman was paid $182,600 to serve as
a consultant for two Texas developments. They said another former
HUD official, Maurice Barksdale, earned nearly $170,000 for
lobbying on Title X projects and also lobbied for developments in
other HUD programs.
   The two Texas developments, Southcreek in Dallas and Steed's
Crossing in Austin, were approved by HUD headquarters after being
rejected by regional offices. They received more than $20 million
in HUD-insured financing. Both owners have kept up loan payments
but the audit reports questioned the long-term viability of the
developments.
   The two were cited in a list of 10 projects that auditors said
should not have been approved. In six of the 10, ``there were
indications of consultant influence with HUD's program decisions,''
one report said.
   Telephone calls seeking comment from Wiseman were not
immediately returned.
   Virtually all of the questioned decisions were made by James
Nistler, HUD's former deputy assistant secretary for single-family
housing, according to the reports. He left the agency shortly after
Kemp took over, and efforts to locate him for comment Thursday were
not successful.
   Favoritism also played a role in the approval of a Houston
development whose owners defaulted on a $25.6 million mortgage,
forcing HUD to pay a $23 million insurance claim, auditors said.
   In that case, Nistler in 1986 allowed developers to refinance
the troubled Cumberland development, first backed by a $13.2
million HUD loan in 1982. Nistler approved the loan despite
evidence of myriad problems and explicit regulations against using
Title X loans for refinancing, auditors said.
   They said the father of the principal developer, Marc D. Kovens
of Florida, ``was a good friend'' of Nistler's. ``It appeared HUD
approved the project because of an intent to favor the owner's
interest over those of HUD,'' the auditors said. The refinancing
allowed Kovens to pay off a $2.7 million debt, they said.
   Other consultants who lobbied to win approval of Title X
projects were Lou Kitchin, an adviser to the Reagan and Bush
presidential campaigns, and Milton Masson, who served as western
regional director of the 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign.
   Kitchin, who has acknowledged lobbying HUD, was hired by several
Title X developers, including a North Carolina investors group
involving former Republican Gov. James E. Holshouser Jr.
   Holshouser and his partners, with Kitchin's help, received a
waiver to secure a $1.7 million loan for a Wilmington development
without posting collateral. The owners defaulted last December.
   Two of Holshouser's partners in that deal were among the
developers of another North Carolina project, Northwoods in Cary,
whose 1988 default cost HUD more than $2.6 million.
   Masson's firm received $285,000 to lobby for approval of a $10
million Tennessee project, the reports said. The auditors said the
mortgage was bloated by $1.2 million because HUD's Nashville office
approved excessive land appraisal and development costs.
   The auditors said HUD employees approved those rates because of
pressure from supervisors. ``They were constantly aware of the
consultant's influence and felt extraordinary pressure,'' one
report said of the staff.

<HEAD>Mills Board to Reconsider Vote Admitting Men Undergraduates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trustees of Mills College will meet
next week to reconsider their decision to admit male undergraduates
but will reverse the vote only if another way to preserve the
school's finances can be devised, the school's president said.
   The incoming student body president, Melissa Stevenson-Dile,
said she was ``very pleased'' by Thursday's action but added that
students will stand by their pledge to shut down the institution
until they have official proof that men will be kept out of
undergraduate classes. Males have been admitted to graduate
programs since the 1930s.
   Mills President Mary Metz said the board's 12-member executive
committee voted unanimously to reopen the issue on the basis of a
plan from the alumnae association to start an intensive
fund-raising drive and increase the $72 million endowment by $10
million.
   She said that before the board takes another vote, the faculty,
administration, staff and students must present plans that ``show
promise of the college achieving financial stability.''
   The students have been blockading the administration building
and boycotting classes since the board of trustees voted May 3 to
admit male undergraduates, citing decline enrollment and revenues.
Mills has about 775 undergraduates, and trustees have said it needs
1,000 to survive.
   The student protesters say they enrolled at the 138-year-old
school because they believed that not having to compete with or be
distracted by men improved their chances for a good education. They
cite studies showing that graduates of women's colleges are more
successful.
   The 35-member board is expected to reconsider its decision at
meetings May 17 and 18.

<TEXT>
   Gambling opponents on
this besieged Mohawk reservation welcomed a drug raid by Canadian
police but said they feared the arrests would touch off renewed
violence by casino supporters.
   The raid Thursday by three Canadian police agencies at the St.
Regis Indian Reservation netted about 4 pounds of cocaine and a
half-pound of marijuana, worth about $800,000 in U.S. currency,
said Ontario Provincial Police spokesman Peter West.
   Police also seized about $32,000 in U.S. currency and 12 guns,
including three automatic rifles, West said.
   Police arrested 21 people on drug and weapons charges at
Cornwall Island on the reservation and in nearby Cornwall, Ontario,
West said.
   Sixteen suspects were still at large this morning, said Sgt. Al
Crocker.
   The reservation straddles the U.S.-Canadian border. Both New
York and Canadian police said all was quiet today on their
respective sides.
   Chief Mike Mitchell, head of the tribal council that governs the
Canadian side of the reservation, said he saw the raid as
``reaffirming the struggle of the people to rid themselves of the
criminal element in our society.''
   Mitchell and other gambling opponents blame casinos on the U.S.
side for drug trafficking, weapons smuggling and other crime.
Gambling supporters say the casinos are an economic boon for the
impoverished reservation.
   Canadian police and New York state troopers have blockaded the
reservation since May 1, when two Mohawks were shot to death during
fighting between pro- and anti-gambling factions.
   Gambling opponent Doug George, who edits a newspaper on the
reservation, said the arrests may spark fresh violence by groups
such as the Warriors Society, a self-appointed reservation security
patrol that has backed the casino owners.
   ``I think it will make them very angry and I would suspect this
weekend that they're going to plan something in retaliation,''
George said.
   The arrests came after a 14-month undercover investigation on
the reservation, West said. About half of the suspects live on the
reservation. Most were charged with drug trafficking, which carries
a maximum sentence of life in prison, West said.
   Warriors Society spokesman John Boots said no members of his
group were involved in the arrests. ``We have no connection
whatsoever,'' Boots said.
   Mohawks who resent the police presence said authorities used too
much force and were careless in making the arrests.
   Police smashed a glass door at the home of Elvis Thompson, who
was arrested along with three brothers and two cousins, said his
girlfriend, Amanda Adams.
   Police ``didn't even give us a chance to get halfway to the door
before they broke it down,'' Adams said.
   Most of those arrested were released on bail after their
arraignments Thursday.
   Chief Harold Tarbell, a gambling opponent who heads the tribal
council that governs the U.S. side, said he wished police would
launch a similar initiative on the New York side. Unlike the
Canadian sector, the U.S. side has no independent Mohawk police
force.

   A West German army transport
plane loaded with kerosene crashed near the southern city of
Wuerzburg today and burst into flames, killing all 10 people on
board, officials said.
   The plane went down in a remote, wooded area near Wuerzburg, 75
miles south of Frankfurt, Defense Ministry officials said. The
plane was carrying a shipment of kerosene and caught fire when it
crashed, police said.
   A witness reported seeing the airplane flying at a low level
over the area just before the crash, according to Wuerzburg police.
A rescue helicopter rushed to the scene and found the burning plane
wreckage amid some trees.
   The plane was carrying five West German soldiers and five
technicians.

   President Bush, heralding a ``new age
of exploration,'' said today he believes the United States will
send astronauts to Mars in 30 years.
   Bush had previously announced he would send a manned mission to
Mars, but the commencement speech at the Texas A&amp;I University
marked the first time he gave a time goal.
   In the first of a series of graduation speeches this weekend,
Bush turned attention to his space program, leaving behind a
capital in an uproar over taxes and budget negotiations.
   ``Thirty years ago, NASA was founded and the space race began.
And 30 years from now I believe man will stand on another planet,''
said Bush.
   ``And so I am pleased to return to Texas today to announce a new
age of exploration with not only a goal but also a timetable,'' he
said. ``I believe that before Apollo celebrates the 50th
anniversary of its landing on the moon, the American flag should be
planted on Mars.''
   In a speech highlighting space as part of America's heritage of
progress, Bush said, ``It's time to open up the final frontier.
There can be no turning back. America's space program is what
civilization needs to begin this journey to perfect the commitment
to go beyond.''
   Further, he said, ``Each time we go to the frontier and beyond,
we bring back more than we hoped for. This time we have a chance to
bring back more than we can imagine.''
   Bush declared that the July 20, 1969, landing of Apollo 11 as
the first manned spacecraft on the moon ``showed we could meet our
commitments to ourselves and to the world, proof that democracy
could triumph as decisively in peace as it had in war.''
   Bush said that his space plans, which include reviving the moon
program and having an operational space station by the end of this
century, ``will help rekindle public interest in science and
mathematics and revitalize an area of our education system that has
become disturbingly weak.''
   It will ``revolutionize everything from computers to
communication, from medicine to metals, regaining and retaining
America's high-tech competitive edge,'' he said.
   The administration has offered no budget figures for its space
program. Some members of Congress have expressed doubts that the
massive funding anticipated will be available given the
budget-tightening needed to reduce the federal deficit.
   The president also is commencement speaker Saturday at the
University of South Carolina in Columbia and Liberty University in
Lynchburg, Va.
   The trio of speeches follow Bush's first commencement address
this year, at Oklahoma State University last week.
   All are dedicated to the general theme of change in the world.
   In South Carolina, Bush is to focus on changes in Eastern Europe
and the need for a standard of justice as well as democratic
government, an administration official said.
   Before his departure for Texas this morning, Bush's week was
consumed by back-and-forth with Congress on the issue of a fiscal
year 1991 budget.
   He remained uncharacteristically out of sight on Thursday as
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater faced reporters to
disavow a comment by Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, which
reflected greater rigidity than the president has voiced on the
administration's budget posture.
   Bush has said he is entering a series of budget talks with
congressional leaders with ``no preconditions.''
   That differs from his past promises of ``no new taxes,'' even to
reduce a raging budget deficit.
   But Sununu said Wednesday that no preconditions meant that
Democrats were free to suggest tax increases and the White House
was free to say no.
   Sununu's comments were seen as an effort to appease conservative
Republicans who are attacking Bush for abandoning the ``no new
taxes'' pledge.
   They brought immediate criticism, however, from congressional
Democrats who voiced fears that Bush was setting an election-year
trap to get them to push for a tax increase the Republicans could
attack.
   Fitzwater, however, reiterated that nothing is predetermined in
the budget talks, and that the ``table is clean.''
   Further, he insisted, Bush speaks for himself, and his position
is ``no preconditions.''
   The budget talks got under way Sunday when Bush called
congressional leaders to the White House and proposed they work out
a budget both the administration and Congress can agree on.

<HEAD>Reports Suggests NASA Buy More Shuttles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NASA should buy at least one more space
shuttle because there's a 50-50 chance a craft will be lost in the
next several years, a congressional report suggested today.
   A new shuttle, like the one being built to replace the destroyed
Challenger, would cost $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
   The Office of Technology Assessment said NASA's goal of 14
launches a year poses increased risks to astronauts and that the
schedule could be limited ``to a regular, sustainable rate of eight
to 10 launches'' by limiting flights to payloads requiring human
crews.
   ``The actual reliability of the shuttle system is unknown, but
may lie between 97 percent and 99 percent,'' the report said. ``If
reliability is 98 percent, the nation faces a 50-50 chance of
losing an additional orbiter in the next 34 flights.''
   The Challenger explosion in 1986, which killed seven crew
members, happened on the 25th shuttle flight; there have been 10
missions since.
   The loss of Challenger left three shuttles in the NASA fleet,
Discovery, Atlantis and Columbia. A new shuttle, to be called
Endeavour, will be finished next year and flying in 1992.
   OTA, a congressional advisory group, said in its report that the
nation can make do with existing launch systems until the next
century if it follows the current course of steady growth in
civilian and military space activities.
   But if the United States wants a permanent lunar base, missions
to Mars or a space-based defense system, the report said, it should
be prepared to spend $10 billion to $20 billion in development
costs alone for new launch systems.
   ``Because the nation cannot afford to invest in all the good
ideas proposed for improved or new launch systems, Congress and the
administration will have to choose from a wide range of options,''
the report said. ``Some choices must be made in the next two to
three years. Others can wait longer.''
   The most immediate choices are making improvements in expendable
rockets that are based on 1950s and '60s designs, limiting shuttle
flights, buying more orbiters and paying for shuttle improvement
program.
   ``Much like the B-52 bomber, which has steadily grown more
capable and remained operational for over 30 years, the ability of
the shuttle orbiters to stay in service can theoretically be
extended for another two decades,'' the report said.
   NASA is improving the shuttle's main engines, has begun a
program to build more reliable, higher capacity advanced solid
rocket motors, and is installing new computers more tolerant than
the ones built in the 1970s.
   The report also said:
   _The risk to the shuttle fleet would be reduced by developing a
heavy-lift launch system, known as Shuttle-C, that would replace
the orbiter with a cargo container. NASA estimates the Shuttle-C
will cost $1.1 billion, plus $400 million for each launch.
   _Congress should decide whether to develop a rescue vehicle for
astronauts aboard the space station that will be in orbit late in
the decade, the report said. It would cost $1 billion to $2 billion.
   ``To decide whether a risk-reducing effort is worth the
investment required, Congress must be advised about how much the
investment would reduce the risk,'' OTA said. ``Even if an
alternate crew-return vehicle were built, and worked as planned, it
would not eliminate all risks to station crew members.''
   _For the long haul, Congress should look to developing two new
launch systems: a personnel carrier-launch system that would carry
little cargo and be launched atop an expendable rocket, and a
larger advanced manned launch system using a reusable vehicle.
   Work on those systems would be cheaper, OTA said, than building
an aerospace plane that would take off like an airplane from a
conventional runway.
   Technology for such a plane is being developed jointly by NASA
and the Air Force. A full-test vehicle, OTA said, may cost more
than $5 billion.
   The OTA report was one of a series entitled ``Access to Space.'''

<HEAD>Soviets, West Germans Haggle Over How To Cover Red Army Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany could find itself picking
up part of the tab for Soviet troops based in East Germany after
the two Germanys merge their economies this summer, Bonn officials
said today.
   The officials said preliminary negotiations have started between
Moscow and Bonn on an arrangement to use West German marks to
temporarily cover the living costs for Red Army troops stationed in
East Germany.
   The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   It appears that the 380,000 Soviet soldiers in East Germany
could start receiving West German marks for their living costs in
exchange for Soviet rubles after the German economies are merged on
July 2.
   Such an agreement would mark the first time a NATO country ended
up paying in its own currency for the stationing of Soviet troops.
   A West German government spokeman, Dieter Vogel, said that
Finance Minister Theo Waigel will travel to East Berlin on Monday
to discuss the Soviet troops issue with the East German government.
   Under current bilateral agreements, the Soviet Union buys East
German marks in exchange for so-called transfer rubles at a
preferential rate. Transfer rubles are not convertible to Western
countries.
   The East marks are then used to pay for goods and services for
Soviet soldiers stationed in East Germany. These have been
relatively inexpensive because of state subsidies.
   When the West German mark becomes East Germany's official
currency July 2, East Germany will also start to eliminate state
subsidies. That means a new exchange rate will have to be
established between the West German mark and the Soviet transfer
ruble, and the steep price rises anticipated as a result of the
loss of subsidies will also have to be taken into account.
   It remains unclear how much West Germany would end up paying to
maintain the Soviet troops or whether the average Soviet soldier
would come out ahead.
   A West German government official said the bilateral talks with
Moscow are just at a beginning phase, and it is not clear how a new
arrangement for covering the cost of stationing the Soviet troops
will be worked out.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did
not know what the current costs for the Soviet troops are.
   He said the West Germans ``have not yet seen any concrete
proposals'' from the Soviet side on how to cover the Red Army's
costs.

   A 5-year-old Massachusetts girl was
found unharmed at a Gulf Coast fishing lodge and was to return home
with her parents today after a 38-day abduction by an obsessed baby
sitter, authorities said.
   Kenneth M. Cole II, a 24-year-old former bus driver, was charged
with kidnapping after he was arrested Thursday on a tip from the
lodge owner, who saw a local news report on the abduction.
   Nicole Ravesi of Milford, Mass., showed no signs of abuse, FBI
spokesman Paul Cavanagh said. She was to head home today after
getting a new dress and a medical checkup.
   When asked how she felt, Nicole said, ``good,'' but didn't
respond to any other questions when the family met briefly with
reporters at their hotel.
   ``We're thankful to get our daughter back,'' said Frank Ravesi,
adding that the girl was ``kind of scared of the cameras.''
   His wife, Debra, said she was ``very happy, very happy.''
   Cole appeared before a U.S. magistrate late Thursday and agreed
to be returned to Massachusetts to face kidnapping charges there.
   Cole and Nicole had been staying since May 5 at a trailer behind
Sportsman's Lodge in East Point, a panhandle fishing village about
70 miles southwest of Tallahassee, owner Bob Allen said. He said
the girl called Cole ``Dad'' and never spoke of her mother and real
father.
   When Allen called Cole out of the trailer so FBI agents could
rescue the girl Thursday, Nicole was ``kind of down at first,''
Allen said. But she responded quickly after she was given a
sandwich, cookies and milk, said Franklin County Sheriff Warren
Roddenberry.
   ``She had learned, I guess, to depend on this character, but she
is doing quite well,'' the sheriff said.
   The parents arrived in Tallahassee shortly before 11 p.m.
Thursday on a private jet and were taken to a downtown hotel, where
they were reunited with their daughter.
   The reunion was taped by ``America's Most Wanted,'' a Fox
network television program, which featured the case three times
last month and paid for the plane.
   The youngster was reported missing April 3 after she was taken
from a car where she was with a sister waiting for her mother to
finish work.
   In February, social workers had noticed Cole's attachment to the
little girl and alerted the Ravesis, who obtained a restraining
order against Cole to prevent him from seeing or speaking to
Nicole. But the five-day order expired and the family did not
pursue the issue because Cole had stayed away, police said.
   FBI agent James Cagnassola Jr. said Cole may have taken Nicole
to Florida by train. Cole's car was found in an Amtrak parking lot
in Providence, R.I.
   Authorities believe the two spent some time at a lodge in Panama
City Beach before apparently traveling to East Point by bicycle _ a
distance of 83 miles, Cagnassola said.

   A Philippine Airlines jet carrying
119 people exploded and burned today as it prepared to take off,
and officials said a bomb may have been planted on board. Seven
people were killed and more than 80 hurt.
   Survivors spoke of up to three blasts aboard the Boeing 737-300,
and at least three large holes were torn in the roof.
   Flames quickly gutted the interior.
   The plane was being towed to the runway for a domestic flight
when it was rocked by at least one explosion, which occurred before
the jet's two engines were started, said Oscar Alejandro, director
of the government's Air Transport Office.
   The cabin filled with smoke, but most passengers escaped by
sliding down emergency chutes before flames engulfed the plane, he
said. Passengers said some people panicked and trampled one another
rushing for the exits.
   ``There was an explosion in front of me and there was a very bad
smell,'' said passenger Isidro Retaso, 33, of Iloilo. ``So I
immediately opened the emergency exit. I was the first one out of
the plane.
   ``They were still demonstrating the safety equipment when it
occurred. There were three explosions, loud explosions, and the
ceiling shuddered. On the second explosion, I immediately opened
the emergency exit.''
   The bodies of six adults and one child were found inside the
burned-out cabin, said Ed Carrascoso, manager of Manila's domestic
airport. He said they were either killed by the blast or died of
smoke inhalation. All were passengers.
   At least 82 passengers were treated for injuries at the airport
clinic, most for slight sprains and bruises, said airline employee
Alfredo Estrella. Twenty-two passengers were hospitalized, one in
serious condition, officials said.
   The plane was bound for Iloilo, 290 miles to the south, with 113
passengers and six crew members aboard. It was not known how many
foreigners were among the passengers, although authorities said a
Japanese man was treated for burns.
   The injured included Aurelio Periquet Jr., a nationally
prominent business leader and president of the Philippine Chamber
of Commerce, and Rep. Albertito Lopez, a congressman from Iloilo.
   The plane's departure had been slightly delayed because of heavy
air traffic over Manila, officials said.
   Carrascoso said there had been no bomb threats. But Oscar
Alejandro, director of the government's Air Transport Office, said:
``We're looking into the possibility that a bomb was placed
aboard.''
   Alejandro also said police were examining the plane to determine
whether a bomb triggered an explosion.
   Dante Santos, president of Philippine Airlines, said flames
swept through the plane in only four minutes. One blast apparently
occurred near the center of the passenger cabin, near where the
bodies were found, he said.
   ``Initial reports said there was an explosion inside the cabin,
maybe in one of the passengers' baggage,'' he said.
   ``Everything looked normal, but then there was a loud
explosion,'' said passenger Sony Villareal, 30. ``It was really
deafening and strong because luggage fell from the upper
compartments.
   ``After the explosion, there was fire and thick smoke
billowed,'' he said. ``Everybody panicked after that. People were
stumbling over each other trying to get out of the plane.''
   Smoke continued to billow from the plane for about 30 minutes as
firefighters poured foam on the jetliner. The plane was later towed
to a hangar for inspection.
   President Corazon Aquino dispatched her executive secretary,
Catalino Macaraig, to the scene to report on the investigation.
   Officials said the aircraft was leased by Philippine Airlines in
November.
   Today's disaster was the worst aviation tragedy in Manila since
July, when a Philippine Airlines BAC1-11 overshot a runway on a
flight from Zamboanga and slammed into a busy highway. Eight
people, all of them on the ground, were killed and 91 people were
injured in that accident.

<HEAD>Court Tells New York it Can Stop Panhandling in Subways</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ruled that New York
City can oust panhandlers from the subways because asking for money
is not a protected form of speech.
   ``The only message that we are able to espy as common to all
acts of begging is that beggars want to exact money from those whom
they accost,'' the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in a 2-1
opinion Thursday.
   The decision reversed a lower court ruling that said the
Metropolitan Transit Authority's begging prohibition was
unconstitutional because begging is a form of free speech protected
by the First Amendment.
   The earlier ruling had overturned a city program, begun in
October, to crack down on vagrancy in the subway. Many of the
city's estimated 80,000 homeless people congregate underground to
stay warm, sleep and ask for spare change.
   The appeals court ruling means the Transit Authority can ban
begging on trains, near subway stairways, escalators and elevators
and within 25 feet of token booths.
   A transit police spokesman, Sgt. Robert Valentino, said the
police had been enforcing the ban since February because the lower
court ruling had been under appeal, although officers were not
rigorously applying it.
   The transit police officials were mapping strategy today to more
vigorously enforce the ban now, even if it is appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court, Valentino said.
   The court said U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand, who made the
earlier ruling, showed ``an exacerbated deference to the alleged
individual rights of beggars and panhandlers to the great detriment
of the common good.''
   The Transit Authority, which operates the subway system, has an
obligation to provide a safe environment for its ridership, the
appeals court said.
   ``It is fair to say that whether intended as so, or not, begging
in the subway often amounts to nothing less that assault, creating
in the passengers the apprehension of imminent danger,'' the
51-page majority decision said.
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Thomas Meskill pointed to
regulations that allow organized charities to solicit donations in
the subway system. He said beggars deserve the same protection.
   ``I simply fail to see why the Transit Authority should be able
to permit organized charities, but not beggars, to rattle a cup
full of change as one passes by,'' Meskill said.
   Robert Kiley, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, called the decision a victory for the millions of subway
riders.
   ``We believe the subways are a means of transportation, not an
open field for panhandling,'' he said. ``The transit police may now
proceed with our efforts to restore order to the transit system.''
   The appeals court decision stemmed from a class-action lawsuit
brought by the Legal Action Center for the Homeless last November
on behalf of all people who beg in the subway system.
   A lawyer said the homeless advocates might appeal the decision.

<HEAD>Shiite Leader Rules Out Negotiating With Israel Over Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An influential Shiite Moslem leader today
ruled out negotiations with Israel on a prisoner exchange that
could secure the release of Western hostages held in Lebanon.
   ``The believers have every moral, religious and humanitarian
objection against negotiating with Israel,'' Hussein Musawi told a
news conference at his headquarters in east Lebanon's ancient city
of Baalbek.
   ``Our war with the enemies of God is open-ended,'' Musawi said.
   Excerpts of the news conference were broadcast by the
Communist-run Voice of The People radio station.
   Musawi heads Islamic Amal, a pro-Syrian wing in the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God. Hezbollah is believed to
be the umbrella for Shiite extremists holding most of the 16
Western hostages, including six Americans.
   Musawi is believed to wield influence on Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine, the group that released American hostage
Robert Polhil, 55, on April 22.
   Another group calling itself the Organization of Islamic Dawn
released another American, Frank Reed, 57, on April 30.
   Iran and the hostage-holders demanded a goodwill gesture from
the United States after the release of Polhill and Reed.
   They have asked Washington to pressure Israel to release some
300 Lebanese and Palestinian detainees, and that the United States
and its Western allies help determine the fate of four Iranians who
disappeared in Lebanon in 1982.
   The Iranians were kidnapped in the Christian heartland north of
Beirut by right-wing militiamen. Militia officials have said they
believe the Iranians are dead, but Tehran says it has information
they are still alive.
   Israel says it would negotiate a swap provided it includes an
Israeli airman and two soldiers captured by Shiite groups in south
Lebanon in 1986.
   Political analysts assume that if the swap of Israeli and
Lebanese and Palestinian detainees occurred, some of the 16 Western
hostages would be freed.
   In addition to the six Americans, the Western hostages include
four Britons, two Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman.
   The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>State Deptartment Backs Chinese Couple Who Fled Forced Abortions</HEAD>

   The State Department has ruled that a
Chinese couple who fled their homeland's forced abortion policy
qualify for refugee status, clearing the way for them to receive
political asylum, their lawyer said today.
   Li Jin Lin and his wife, Wang Sai Zhen, are the first known
cases to test President Bush's Nov. 30 directive that grants asylum
to people fleeing forced abortions or sterilizations in their
native countries.
   They had been awaiting a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service hearing that would decide whether they could stay in the
United States, but the State Department ruling effectively ended
the proceedings against them, said Kathleen Rimar, the Lis' lawyer.
   The State Department letter said the Lis qualify for refugee
status under federal law, but did not specifically mention the
abortion issue.
   ``They got, really, just a form letter,'' Rimar said.
   The letter rejected refugee status for the Lis' nephew, Chun
Kong Cheung, who accompanied them on their trip to the United
States, but Rimar said she would ask the State Department to
reconsider based on new evidence that the Chinese government has
been looking for Chun and that he might face sterilization or death
if forced to return.
   Li, a 37-year-old machinist, and his 34-year-old wife fled their
hometown of Fuzhou last year when Ms. Wang became pregnant with
what would have been the couple's second child. Chinese law limits
most families to one child and requires women who conceive again to
undergo abortions.
   The couple paid smugglers in Canada about $1,500 apiece to get
into the United States illegally, but the INS caught them in
Albany. Ms. Wang was allowed to remain in the United States because
of her advanced pregnancy, but Li was sent back to Canada.
   When he and his nephew tried to cross the border again last
October, they were caught at the international Peace Bridge in
Buffalo and jailed. After Bush issued his order, they applied for
asylum under it and reached a plea bargain on the illegal-entry
charges that freed them from jail.
   Chun cannot be deported until 1994 in any case, thanks to a
presidential order covering all Chinese refugees, Rimar said.
   The Lis, who are now working in restaurants in New York City,
will have to return to Buffalo for an interview with the INS, but
that will be little more than a formality, Rimar said.
   John Ingham, INS district director in Buffalo, was not in his
office this morning and did not immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment.
   The State Department's policy is not to comment on individual
asylum cases, a spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   When the captain of the USS Conyngham
reached the bridge minutes after a fire swept through his ship, he
feared he might have to order the crew to abandon ship, he said
today.
   ``But when I saw the determination of the faces of my men, all
those thoughts left my mind,'' Cmdr. William R. Williams told
reporters in front of the damaged guided missile destroyer at the
Norfolk Naval Station.
   The fire Tuesday killed the ship's operations officer, Lt. Cmdr.
Algernon Pope Gordon Jr., and injured 18 crewmen. Gordon's
promotion to lieutenant commander was to have taken effect in a few
weeks, but the Navy said today it gave him the honor posthumously.
   A hole 6 feet by 5 feet has been cut in the ship's aluminum
superstructure for repair work. Inside the ship, bulkheads melted,
overhead decks were missing and insulation and wire hung everywhere.
   Williams said about 90 percent of the crew was asleep when the
fire broke out at 5 a.m. in the forward boiler room after ``a major
fuel leak.''
   The fire quickly rose up through passageways burning through
decks and sending black, inky smoke through berthing spaces, he
said. The decks were red hot, with fireballs periodically exploding
out of hatches, he said.
   Because the fire was in the middle of the ship, the crew was
split half on the bow, half on the stern. Officers mobilized
firefighting crews and worked inward to battle the blaze, Williams
said.
   Petty Officer 2nd Class Otis Tate, 24, of Hartwell, Ga., said he
ran from his berth to his battle station on the mess deck. A
five-year Navy man, Tate said passageways were filled with smoke
when he led a seven-man crew into the fire area with fire
extinguishers.
   ``This is my first shipboard fire and I hope it's my last,''
Tate said.
   Williams said the crew had been training for a major inspection
which would have tested their firefighting skills. ``For us, the
exam came early,'' he said.

   Floods have killed at least 11 people, wrecked
hundreds of homes and forced the evacuation of more than 18,000
people in the Bashkiria region of the southern Ural Mountains,
officials said today.
   Three people were reported missing.
   The Soviet press has been largely silent about the flooding,
which began about a week ago when the Belaya, or White River,
overflowed its banks due to heavy rains and melting snow.
   Alexei I. Kharlov, deputy prime minister of the Bashirian
Autonomous Republic, said by telephone that the flood submerged 130
villages and 13,000 houses. Eleven people were killed and three
were missing, he said.
   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda and the unofficial news
agency Postfactum put the death toll at 14, with one missing. The
TV news program Vremya said ``loss of life has occurred'' but did
not give a figure.
   Damage was estimated at $161 million, said Postfactum, one of
several independent news agencies that began in the Soviet Union in
recent years.
   Authorities used helicopters to rescue people from some of the
villages inundated by rising waters that destroyed hundreds of
houses and submerged hundreds of miles of roads and railways, the
Communist Party daily Pravda reported.
   The floods ruined 90 bridges and swept away telephone and power
lines in the region between the industrial cities of Ufa and
Chelyabinsk 720 miles east of Moscow, said Komsomolskaya Pravda,
the Communist youth newspaper.
   Farm lands were devastated, and more than 160,000 cattle were
cut off from pastures or stalls.
   ``This flooding has beaten all the records,'' Pravda reported,
quoting the deputy prime minister of the Bashkirian Soviet
Autonomous Republic, E. Galin. The region is part of the Russian
Federation, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   It was the third disaster to strike Bashkiria over the last
year. A gas pipeline explosion near Ufa in May claimed more than
600 lives, and toxic wastes poisoned tap water in Ufa last month.
   Postfactum said the latest flooding also raised the danger of
overflow from lakes that have been used to collect radioactive
wastewater from nearby nuclear production facilities.
   Lev G. Strobbe, deputy chief of the Chelyabinsk region executive
commitee, said that ``so far I can assure you that there is no
danger from these lakes in connection with this flooding.''
   But, he said, ``if worse comes to worst, the contamained silt
will go by way of northern rivers into the Arctic Ocean, and the
consequences may be disastrous.''

   The interior minister said today he held far-right
leader Jean-Marie Le Pen indirectly responsible for the desecration
of a Jewish cemetery in which a corpse was dug up and impaled on an
umbrella.
   Le Pen denied responsibility and said the desecration of 34
tombs at the cemetery in south-central Carpentras was probably
planned by people who wanted to discredit the extreme right.
   France's National Assembly suspended its session for 15 minutes
today in protest, and leaders across the political spectrum reacted
with outrage at the vandalism, which was discovered early Thursday.
   Relatives held an impromptu religious ceremony at the cemetery,
while about 50 Jewish demonstrators gathered outside under a banner
reading ``We Will Not Let History Repeat Itself.''
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe said several tombs in Carpentras
were left ``in conditions so abominable that one can't describe
them without embarrassment.'' Joxe traveled to the town to inspect
the site.
   The body of an 81-year-old man who died about two weeks ago was
found impaled on an umbrella, police said. Grave markers had been
knocked over and flower pots were trampled.
   A previously unknown group calling itself the ``Mohamed El
Boukima Group'' claimed responsibility in a phone call to a local
newspaper. Police said they were trying to authenticate the call.
   Authorities said the fingerprints of at least four people were
found on tomb stones.
   The incident occurred two days after a nationwide telecast of a
three-hour documentary about Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.
   Officials in Strasbourg, meanwhile, reported that a Jewish
cemetery there had been desecrated. Twenty tomb stones were
overturned between April 12 and May 4 at the Wissembourg Israelite
cemetery, they said.
   And in a related incident, swastikas and Nazi graffiti were
scrawled on official buildings in Rambouillet, near Paris,
officials said.
   Joxe said Le Pen, of the extreme-right National Front, was a
``racist and provocateur.'' The far-right party has been accused of
condoning anti-Semitism and other forms of racism.
   ``Consequently, he, like all racists, like all who express their
anti-Semitism in an explicit or implicit fashion, he is obviously
one of those responsible, not by the acts at Carpentras yesterday,
by all that has been inspired by racist hate for years.''
   Le Pen, in Denmark for a meeting of right-wing European
politicians, said the incident was a plot to soil his party's
reputation.
   ``It seems more and more evident that it is a political plot
against the National Front,'' he said from his hotel north of
Copenhagen. ``I don't feel guilty at all in this case. I condemn
those who did this, and I condemn all those who organized this.''
   After Le Pen left the hotel, about 400 demonstrators threw
paint, smoke bombs and empty bottles at police, Danish radio
reported. The demonstration, which appeared unrelated to the tomb
desecrations in France, occurred outside the Marienlyst Hotel in
Helsingoer, 25 miles north of Copenhagen.
   Protesters shouted ``fascists'' and ``Le Pen go home,'' and
several windows were smashed by stones.
   In a telegram to Carpentras Jewish leader Freddy Haddad,
President Francois Mitterrand said, ``I learned with horror of this
criminal act.''
   Mitterrand later went to the home of France's chief rabbi, Rabbi
Sitruk, to express his distress. ``I've come as one does for a
family in mourning,'' Mitterrand said.
   Jean Kahn, leader of a national coalition of Jewish groups, said
the desecration comes at a time when racial hatred is being
encouraged ``by those who promote anti-Semitic rhetoric and fascist
themes.''
   Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, who left the gala dinner
opening the Cannes film festival after learning of the desecration,
said a racist climate was on the rise in France.
   ``French society must now examine its conscience _ and
urgently,'' he said.
   Mayor Jean-Claude Andrieu described Carpentras as a quiet town
of about 26,000.
   Recent polls show about 15 percent of the electorate support Le
Pen and his National Front Party, which has one seat in the
277-seat National Assembly. Le Pen won 11 percent of the vote in
the first round of the 1988 presidential election. Le Pen has
become increasingly visible as the Socialist government tries to
deal with immigration and racism, top issues in France today.

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Switzerland's most prominent animal rights
campaigner Friday denounced government plans to allow sales of dog
and cat meat as ``monstrous and obscene.''
   Franz Weber, in a column in Lausanne's Le Matin newspaper,
charged the proposed law endorsed ``a kind of cannibalism'' and
would ``lower us to the level of the disparaged monsters of the
Philippines and Korea.''
   Swiss authorities have proposed a sweeping revision of 1954 food
regulations that would drop the ban on butchers' selling dog and
cat meat. The aim is to bring Swiss law into line with the European
Community.
   The government proposal, which needs parliamentary approval, has
been circulated for public comment through May 31.
   Werner Friedrich, deputy director of the Swiss Hotel
Association, told Bern's Der Bund newspaper the prospect was
``frightening.''
   ``Such a change of food laws would definitely overstep the
boundaries of good taste,'' he was quoted as saying.

   A Lithuanian doused his body with
alcohol and set himself on fire at a border crossing between the
Soviet Union and Hungary, suffering serious injuries, police said
Friday.
   Police near the border crossing at Zahony in northeastern
Hungary said they did not know the reason for Thursday's incident.
They said they did not know if it was connected with Lithuania's
independence battle with Moscow.
   The Lithuanian was identified as Rimantas Daugintis, a resident
of Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.
   He was hospitalized with burns over 80 percent of his body,
police said. On April 26, 52-year-old Stanislovas Jamaitis, a
Lithuanian protesting Soviet moves against his homeland, committed
suicide in front of Moscow's Bolsho Theater by setting himself on
fire.
   The Baltic republic of Lithuania, which was forcibly annexed by
the Soviet Union in 1940, declared itself independent in March. The
Kremlin has imposed sanctions against the republic in an effort to
end the independence drive.

   About 100 elderly protesters marched
toward the Japanese Embassy on Friday and demanded that Japan
apologize and offer compensation for wartime atrocities.
   Riot police using shields and buses stopped and surrounded the
protesters when they were about 100 feet from the embassy in
central Seoul. Most of the demonstrators were relatives of Koreans
who were drafted by Japan and killed during World War II.
   They sat down on the street after being blocked by police.
   ``We oppose President Roh's visit to Japan,'' the protesters
shouted. ``Japan, the war criminal, must make an open apology.''
Roh is scheduled to visit Japan on May 24.
   There were no clashes or arrests. Police appeared cautious in
handling the protesters.
   Japan colonized Korea from 1910 to 1945, drafting hundreds of
thousands of Koreans into the military and forced labor.

   About 200 East German security
experts have been sent home by South Yemen because their government
has not paid their salaries for months, a Saudi Arabian newspaper
reported Friday.
   The daily Asharq Al-Awsat said the cutoff in pay followed the
political changes that took place in Eastern Europe. The
newspaper's report was attributed to unnamed informed sources in
Aden, South Yemen.
   South Yemen became the Arab world's only Marxist state with its
independence from Britain in 1967. It fostered strong ties with the
Soviet Union and other communist nations.
   East Germany's communist regime was overthrown in October.
   The Saudi paper said the East German experts were helping in the
field of security.

<TEXT>
   Japan's most famous waterbird, a traffic-stopping
duck, returned to her Tokyo pond Friday after being scared away by
a horde of photographers and a wildlife worker hoping to mend the
bird's bad leg.
   For at least a decade, the spotbilled duck has returned each May
to a decorative pond in front of the headquarters of trading giant
Mitsui and Co. and hatched a brood of ducklings.
   A few weeks later, after the young birds are strong swimmers,
the mother has herded them across an eight-lane road to spend the
summer in the Imperial Palace moat.
   The operation requires a squad of police to stop traffic, and
usually there are five times as many photographers as ducks. The
ducks' passage has become a rite of summer that is reported as
avidly as the cherry blossoms in April.
   This year the rite seemed in danger. The duck had a bad leg, and
city authorities tried to capture it for medical treatment Thursday
night. But the bird flew away, apparently scared by a
photographer's camera flash. Photographers had promised not to use
flashes.
   Mitsui reported the bird returned early Friday, still with a bad
leg, and press reports said another attempt might be made to
capture it.
   The Japan Wild Birds Society disagreed with the plan. ``That
duck was strong enough to escape,'' said Takio Nakamura, head of
the society's protection department. ``She's probably strong enough
not to need protection.''
   But Nakamura agreed that it is ``quite a special case ...
because that duck is famous.''

   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan prompted
outrage from environmentalists today by suggesting that the
Endangered Species Act should be changed to more easily accommodate
some economic development.
   Lujan made the remark Thursday in Colorado when he noted that
concern about a group of
both were charged in the case. Allison was convicted of murder last
year in a separate trial.
   The couple was charged in the killing of policeman Melvin Pyne,
whose headless body was found March 31, 1989, in the Monrovia
suburb of Caldwell, where the Allisons lived.
   Witnesses said the couple planned to use the officer's blood in
a ritual aimed at giving the major general the power to topple
President Samuel Doe.
   The couple told judges they were framed by police officers
jealous of their wealth and flamboyant lifestyle.
   Mrs. Allison's lawyers have filed an appeal against the judgment.
   Allison was sentenced to death last year and is in prison. No
execution date was set.

   A man who served more than seven years in
prison for two mutilation slayings he says he didn't commit
prepared today to leave jail for good and begin fighting to clear
his name.
   Dale Johnston learned of his release Thursday after an appeals
court ruled that prosecutors could not use evidence they claimed
was crucial to obtaining a second conviction in the 1982 deaths of
his stepdaughter and her fiance. The prosecutors then dropped the
case.
   ``This day I knew would get here sooner or later,'' Johnston
said in an interview at the Licking County Justice Center. ``I made
it my No. 1 priority. Now I plan to make finding the real killer of
those kids my No. 1 priority.''
   Annette Cooper Johnston, 18, and Todd L. Schultz, 19, both of
Logan were last seen alive in that southeast Ohio community on Oct.
4, 1982. Their torsos were found 10 days later in the Hocking
River. Other body parts were unearthed in a cornfield.
   Prosecutors contended jealousy was the motive for the killings
and that Johnston had a sexual relationship with his stepdaughter.
   Johnston, 56, was convicted in 1984 on two counts of aggravated
murder and was sentenced to death. The Ohio Supreme Court in 1988
threw out the verdict and ordered a new trial, ruling that a
witness whose memory had been refreshed by hypnosis had been
improperly allowed to testify.
   The second trial was put on hold last July after Judge William
Gillie ruled that statements police obtained from Johnston during
8{ hours of questioning without a lawyer present were inadmissible.
   Gillie also threw out clothing taken from Johnston, including
boots that prosecutors linked to footprints near where the bodies
were found.
   On Thursday, a state appeals court unanimously upheld Gillie's
decision, saying police tried to deceive and coerce Johnston into
making statements against his will and gave no legitimate reason
for so lengthy an interrogation.
   Prosecutor Charles Gerken dropped the case Thursday afternoon,
and Johnston would be released as soon as the order is filed with
the Franklin County clerk of courts, said Thomas Tyack, one of
Johnston's attorneys.
   ``I still believe in the criminal justice system but I was a
victim of some members of that profession who were not the best
that they should be,'' Johnston said in Thursday's interview. He
would not elaborate.
   Johnston won't say where he'll go after his release for fear of
retribution from people he claims have threatened him, his family
and his attorneys. He and another defense lawyer, Robert Suhr,
declined to identify any of the people.
   Johnston's ex-wife, Sarah, said she was happy but indicated she
still suffered emotional wounds. ``You have to get over the grief.
But it's always there every day. I kid you not. Every day,'' she
said.
   The Johnstons are divorced. She remarried and is living in
southern Ohio outside Hocking County.
   Schultz's father, Donald, said there is no doubt in his mind
that Johnston killed the two. ``He knows who did it. He did it,''
Schultz said. He noted that Johnston was found guilty by three
trial judges.

   The shelling came two days after Aoun declared the coastline of
the Christian enclave off limits to international shipping. That
was in an effort to keep supplies from reaching the Lebanese Forces
militia commanded by his rival, Samir Geagea.
   Police said Aoun's gunners on a mountain ridge overlooking the
Mediterranean fired two warning shots from a 155mm howitzer at the
Victory I ferry as it approached the port of Jounieh on Friday
morning. Jounieh is controlled by Geagea's forces.
   The ship, arriving from Larnaca, Cyprus, stopped a few miles
offshore for about two hours before heading into the port. It let
off its 66 passengers and then headed back to Cyprus, police said.
   The ferry is one of the few remaining links to the outside world
for residents of the Christian enclave, which is surrounded on land
by Syrian troops and their Moslem militia allies.
   Police said four civilians were wounded when Aoun's gunners
fired on the Beirut port at midday to keep Geagea's machine
gun-mounted speedboats away.
   The battle for control of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave
has left 930 people dead and 2,576 wounded since it erupted Jan. 30.
   Geagea's militia controls most of the Christian enclave's
28-mile-long coastline.
   Geagea's speedboats are blockading a three-mile coastal strip at
Dbaye, between Beirut and Jounieh, where Aoun's forces have set up
a makeshift harbor to try to bring in military supplies.
   Both sides have been reported to be running low on ammunition.
   Rival Christian snipers in front-line positions in east Beirut
and the surrounding hinterland kept most of the enclave's roads
closed to traffic for a fourth straight day Friday.
   Police said only mediators representing Patriarch Nasrallah
Sfeir, spiritual head of the Maronite Catholic sect, were allowed
to pass through checkpoints manned by the rival Christian forces.
   They were shuttling between Geagea's seaside command post near
Jounieh and Aoun's headquarters at the hilltop presidential palace
in Baabda in an effort work out a cease-fire, a police spokesman
said.
   Aoun has rejected an Arab League-brokered peace accord,
supported by Syria, to end Lebanon's many-sided civil war, because
it does not guarantee the withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops.
   Geagea has recognized the Syrian-backed government of President
Elias Hrawi and cautiously accepted the peace plan, which calls for
an equal distribution of power between Christians and Moslems.
   In south Lebanon, meanwhile, rival Shiite Moslem factions allied
with Syria and Iran declared a cease-fire Friday morning in Iqlim
Al-Tuffah.
   Fighting between the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
and the pro-Syrian Amal militia has been raging in the area since
Dec. 23.
   The confrontation is part of a 2-year-old struggle for control
of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, who make up the largest single
sect in the country.

   A strong earthquake was recorded Friday in the
Sea of Japan about 370 miles northeast of the North Korean capital,
the Hong Kong Observatory reported.
   It said the quake measured 5.2 on the Richter scale. An
observatory statement said an initial reading of the quake,
recorded at 9.14 p.m., determined the epicenter to be 372 miles
northeast of Pyongyang, North Korea.
   No further details were available.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
   Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10
times greater. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause serious damage on
land, and a quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage.

<TEXT>
   The City Council decided today that the
federal law allowing the death penalty for some drug-related
homicides has no place here, overwhelmingly approving a measure
aimed at blocking enforcement.
   The council voted 10-3 to approve a resolution urging the city's
law officers to bypass the U.S. attorney's office if the death
penalty is at stake. Officers instead would be urged to turn cases
over to state and local prosecutors, because Minnesota has no death
penalty.
   ``My personal opinion is that the death penalty serves no useful
societal purpose,'' said council member Joan Campbell, chief
sponsor of the resolution.
   ``I'm not in any way suggesting that the crimes are not
heinous,'' Campbell continued. ``I don't think it's the
responsibility of a civilized society to kill people if they kill
other people.''
   But council member Dennis Schulstad, who opposed the resolution,
said, ``The message we're sending is that we care much more about
the criminals in this city than we care about the victims.''
Another opponent on the council, Walt Dziedzic, argued that it
``sends the wrong message out there that this city, this great
city, is soft on crime.''
   The resolution was sparked by a 1988 federal law that sanctions
the death penalty for some drug-related homicides.
   In the first use of the law, federal prosecutors in Chicago said
Thursday they will seek the death penalty against two men accused
of murdering a federal witness to protect their $50,000-a-day drug
ring.
   Before the vote, Campbell said passage of her resolution would
show that ``we don't like the death penalty, and we don't like the
federal government telling the state of Minnesota what to do. She
added that it is ``not a deterrent to crime. It's been proven over
and over again.''
   The resolution was approved 4-1 last week by a City Council
panel.
   ``My hope is that this sets an example to other jurisdictions
and to other cities that they can say no to the federal death
penalty,'' said Hennepin County Attorney Tom Johnson, who helped
draft the resolution.
   Critics say the resolution lacks teeth because federal
authorities could step in and try a homicide case even if local
officials didn't refer it to them.
   Schulstad, who voted against the resolution last week, called it
``strictly a public relations thing.''
   Minneapolis Police Lt. Richard Huss, the only person to testify
against the resolution last week, said Thursday that the measure
would call attention to what he considers the state's already lax
criminal system.
   U.S. Attorney Jerome Arnold in Minneapolis said he is willing to
push for the death penalty in the first appropriate case.
   Minnesota has not had such a case so far, he said, but ``with
the attendant violence to drug crimes, there is some degree of
likelihood that a homicide would fall into the federal categories.''

<HEAD>Former ``Today'' Producer to Run ``NBC Nightly News''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Steve Friedman, the executive producer of NBC's
``Today'' show when it was first in ratings, is returning to NBC as
executive producer of the ``NBC Nightly News,'' the network said
today.
   Friedman will succeed Bill Wheatley, the program's executive
producer for five years. No date has been set for the change, but
it will be soon, said Peggy Hubble, a spokeswoman for NBC News.
   A call to the office of Tom Brokaw, the program's anchor and
managing editor, seeking comment was referred to Ms. Hubble's
office.
   But the move comes at a time his program and Dan Rather's ``CBS
Evening News'' have been alternating in third place in the ratings.
   Brokaw's program has been third in ratings for two consecutive
weeks.
   Friedman's association with Brokaw goes back to the early 1970s
when Brokaw was an anchorman and Friedman a news writer at
NBC-owned KNBC-TV in Burbank, Calif. They also worked together on
``Today'' when Brokaw was its co-host.
   Friedman left ``Today'' three years ago to develop and produce
what proved to be an ill-fated television version of USA Today
newspaper.
   Costing $40 million to start up, the syndicated program, ``USA
Today on TV,'' was a critical and commercial failure, and was axed
last year after 15 months on the air.

<TEXT>
   The KGB is in town, tormenting the British with
boasts about yet another top traitor in the Kim Philby mold,
possibly the long-sought ``Fifth Man.''
   This latest caper includes a Soviet TV movie on the affair and a
KGB public relations man who was in London on Friday to help answer
reporters' questions.
   Some scholars of espionage have long suspected that Soviet
penetration of the British secret service did not end with the
unmasking of Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Anthony Blunt and Harold
``Kim'' Philby, and that there was probably a fifth man.
   Others maintain the KGB has deliberately fostered the theory to
keep Western intelligence in doubt.
   Until now, the hunt for the Fifth Man has leaned heavily on
conjecture, dragging several illustrious British names through the
mud. Now comes the KGB, almost gleefully claiming the speculation
is true.
   Yuri Modin, one of Philby's handlers, says in a Soviet film
about the spy's exploits that ``the fifth one is not known to our
ex-enemy, ex-opponent, so I am not in a position to tell you
anything about that.''
   So a Fifth Man really existed? ``Yes, that's a fact.'' Has he
met him? ``Yes, I know him personally.''
   Is he an interesting man? ``Well, now I'll try to avoid your
question. He is an interesting man with his own peculiarities,
etc., with his own ideas...''
   At a preview of the film at a London televison studio, KGB press
officer Col. Igor Prelin gave more details, claiming the Fifth Man
is ``of Philby's generation'' and retired from espionage work.
   Philby died in Moscow in 1988 at 76. He implied that the KGB had
asked the Fifth Man if he would like to be identified, and the
answer was no.
   ``This person has done a great deal for us. Why should we do him
harm?'' Prelin said.
   Was he in the Soviet Union? No. Britain? Prelin wouldn't say.
Had he ever received a title or other honor in Britain? No comment.
   But then Prelin offered ``another little secret: these five
people had information covering all the different departments and
institutions of the British government.''
   Philby was in the secret service, Blunt worked for the royal
family, and Burgess and Maclean for the Foreign Office. And the
Fifth Man? ``Work it out for yourself,'' said Prelin.
   A British reporter grumbled that it all sounded like ``typical
KGB mischief-making.'' Not at all, insisted Prelin. But when asked
why the KGB was divulging the Fifth Man's existence, he replied
through an interpreter that ``It gives us pleasure.''
   The Philby group, converted to communism while at Cambridge
University in the 1930s, served the Kremlin faithfully until its
unmasking after World War II. In fact, the documentary says, Philby
helped set up the CIA while posted to Washington. Until Philby's
defection in 1963, it was one of the most successful intelligence
operations in history.
   The film, ``Comrade Philby,'' was made by the Soviet state film
company and was being screened on Soviet TV Friday night. British
viewers will see it Monday.
   One man who dismisses the Fifth Man theory is historian Hugh
Trevor-Roper, now Lord Dacre.
   ``I just don't believe them. I'll consider it if somebody
produces evidence, but I don't regard statements by the KGB as
evidence,'' he said.
   He noted that Oleg Gordievsky, a senior KGB officer who defected
to Britain, had insisted publicly that there was no Fifth Man.
   ``I can see no reason why Gordievsky should not be speaking the
truth,'' he said. ``I can see why the KGB would be telling a lie,
just to keep us worried.''
   Rupert Allison, a Conservative member of Parliament, said he
thought the Soviets may have revived the Fifth Man issue because
they were unhappy that Gordievsky appearing on British television.
   ``Nobody likes insiders spilling the beans,'' said Allison, who
writes about espionage under the pseudonym Nigel West. `` I think
it is not improbable to believe that the KGB is saying, `We've all
got our secrets and if you try to embarrass us with Gordievsky, we
will respond.'''

<HEAD>Police Launch Dragnet For Radical Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By C.W. LIM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have launched a dragnet for 20
fugitive student and dissident leaders believed to have instigated
or led violent anti-government protests this week, prosecutors said
Friday.
   Police said homes, schools and other places frequented by those
in hiding will be searched in one of the largest crackdowns on the
opposition in recent months.
   Dissidents are being sought in connection with nationwide
protests on Wednesday by about 100,000 radicals. During the
violence, protesters burned a U.S. diplomatic building in the
capital.
   ``I think it just happened to be a target of opportunity,'' said
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon. But he added:
``Mindless violence is the enemy of democracy.''
   Prosecutors said 55 protesters were formally arrested Friday for
violating a law banning firebombs and for participating in illegal
rallies in connection with the violence.
   Another 129 people were given summary court trials and sentenced
to jail terms of up to 30 days, prosecutors said.
   Despite government warnings against violence, dissidents said
Friday they would step up anti-government protests to topple the
government of President Roh Tae-woo, and radical students staged
scattered protests.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, about 1,500 students hurled
firebombs and rocks when riot police used tear gas to block
anti-government protesters from marching off Chosun University, the
South Korean news agency Yonhap reported.
   In Seoul, six radical students armed with firebombs and iron
bars seized a third-floor office in South Korea's tax
administration headquarters. They demanded Roh resign, saying his
economic policies favored big companies.
   Police immediately charged into the building, knocked down
barricaded doors with hammers and arrested the six. One protester
was injured.
   In leaflets scattered through the building, the protesters
accused Roh's government of implementing a tax system that favored
the rich.
   With inflation climbing, criticism of Roh's government has
mounted among South Koreans. Housing and other prices have nearly
doubled since Roh took office in February 1988.
   Police took 1,084 protesters into custody in Seoul on Thursday,
when more than 6,000 students and dissidents staged violent street
protests in capital and nine other cities for the second
consecutive day.
   Thousands of riot police have remained on alert in Seoul since
students demanding Roh's resignation rampaged through central Seoul
on Wednesday, burning police vehicles and setting fire to an office
of the U.S. Information Service.
   About 150 people, including 100 police, were injured.
   The violence coincided with the inaugural convention of the
newly created Democratic Liberal Party. Opponents contend the
gigantic new governing coalition, a merger of the ruling party with
two opposition groups, was a political coup that altered party
alliances without an election.
   The protests were the largest and most violent since nationwide
demonstrations forced former authoritarian President Chun Doo-hwan
to announce major reforms three years ago. Those reforms included
popular presidential elections that put Roh in power.
   The government has said it will take firm action against labor
and political violence, contending South Korea's sagging economy
cannot endure further disturbances.

<TEXT>
   They didn't eat their peas, they never call, and
they almost always hold their annual meeting on Mother's Day.
What's a mom to do with the members of the American Psychiatric
Association?
   For the fifth straight year, APA members will spend that special
day in meetings, courses and talks, prompting this headline in The
Wall Street Journal: ``Oedipus Wrecks Mother's Day.''
   Instead of taking Mother to brunch, the psychiatrists will
attend sessions such as ``Psychological Management of
Schizophrenia,'' ``Object Relations Theory in General Psychiatry''
and ``New Developments in Geriatric Psychiatry.''
   Well, docs, here's an old development in geriatric psychiatry:
your elderly mom would like some attention on the second Sunday in
May.
   Seth Stein, executive director of the APA's New York state
affiliate, said that over the years some members have complained
about the convention's scheduling. But he said that finding a time
that's good for 10,000 people _ and a city that can accommodate
them all _ is not easy.
   ``In the grand scheme of things, I can't see what relevance this
has,'' he sniffed. He also pointed out that the official opening
session was not until 5 p.m., which would allow members to
telephone their mothers _ if they're not visiting the Bronx Zoo,
the World Trade Center or Times Square.
   John Hoffman, manager of convention services for the city's
tourism bureau, said Mother's Day weekend was not prime convention
time.
   ``It's kind of sacred,'' he said. ``I can't even get a lot of my
own people to work.''
   The psychiatrists have met on Mother's Day 10 times in the past
22 years, a tradition that even the election of the group's first
woman president in 1985 did not weaken.
   But change looms. Although the association will meet in New
Orleans next year on Mother's Day _ lots of distractions there, too
_ in the following three years the session will be on other
weekends in May.
   ``I think it's very likely we'll not be scheduling any more
meetings on Mother's Day,'' said Dr. Elissa Benedek, the
organization's president-elect.
   And this year the Ann Arbor, Mich., psychiatrist has a solution:
she's bringing her four kids with her.

<HEAD>Matheney Sentenced to Death for Murder of Ex-Wife During Prison

<TEXT>
   A man who used the hours of a brief
prison furlough to murder his former wife was sentenced today to
die in the electric chair after he told a judge she was to blame
for her death.
   Alan L. Matheney was condemned by Lake Superior Court Judge
James E. Letsinger for the beating death of Lisa M. Bianco.
   Matheney, 39, stood silently as Letsinger read the sentence.
   Moments earlier, Matheney had blamed Ms. Bianco herself for her
slaying, saying she had conspired with St. Joseph County Prosecutor
Michael Barnes to imprison him unjustly. He had been in prison for
attacking her at the time of the furlough.
   ``It was the illegal acts these two people did to me that led to
the acts of March 4,'' the day Ms. Bianco was beaten to death in
1989, Matheney said.
   The death stirred widespread outrage among advocates for
battered women, in part because prison officials admitted they had
failed to notify Ms. Bianco that the furlough had been approved,
despite her requests for such notice.
   After the couple's 1985 divorce, Matheney was sentenced to two
years for criminal confinement for taking the children out of
state. In 1987, he was arrested for attacking Ms. Bianco and
pleaded guilty to assault in exchange for the dismissal of rape and
confinement charges.
   No execution date was set. The conviction and death sentence
will be appealed automatically to the Indiana Supreme Court.
   The victim's father, Eugene Bianco, said he was pleased with the
sentence.
   ``I just hope they carry it out, and I'm there to pull the
switch,'' he said.
   Letsinger, a special judge in the case, could have sentenced
Matheney to a maximum 80-year prison term if he had not ordered the
death penalty. Matheney was convicted April 11.
   Matheney's attorney, Scott L. King, said prior to the sentencing
that his client was emotionally disturbed and unable to control
himself when he beat Ms. Bianco to death.
   ``This was a crime of passion,'' said King, disputing
prosecutors' contentions that the crime was coldly planned.
   Matheney had violated the terms of his pass and an earlier court
order when he left central Indiana during his furlough, bound for
Ms. Bianco's home in Mishawaka in the northern part of the state.
   After a brief confrontation in the house, he chased Ms. Bianco
into the street and clubbed her with an unloaded shotgun outside a
neighbor's house.
   The state's prison furlough program was suspended after her
death and later reinstated with tightened restrictions that would
have prevented Matheney's release.

   Pope John Paul II prayed today
for pilgrims who died in a plane crash while on their way to see
him, assuring mourning relatives that ``death is not the last
word'' for those who have faith.
   ``Although human words don't have much value, in these moments
of sorrow I want to express that I actively share in the
suffering,'' the pontiff said in a hastily scheduled stop at this
city's bone-white Colonial cathedral.
   The plane that crashed Thursday had been carrying pilgrims to
see the pope at Tuxtla Gutierrez. The 28 dead included the bishop
of Tapachula, a city near the border with Guatemala.
   The pope had not been scheduled to enter the cathedral, but a
brief memorial was arranged so he could pray for the victims and
comfort their families.
   The pope prayed and kissed the Bishop Luis Miguel Canton Marin's
coffin, then spoke to and blessed a group of 16 weeping mourners.
   ``Death is not the last word, because for those who have faith,
life does not end, it transforms itself,'' the pope said.
   ``Illuminated and aided by that truth, we raise our petition to
the Lord for those who died and invoke consolation for those who
mourn their loved ones,'' John Paul said.
   The pontiff sprinkled holy water on the bishop's coffin and
spoke individually to 16 mourners, many of whom burst into tears.
   ``We have faith we will see him again,'' said Rogelio Gutierrez,
the bishop's brother-in-law.
   The pope then proceeded to a scheduled outdoor service, where he
addressed a huge crowd that included refugees from Guatemala
fleeing repression in their native country.
   The pope's visit to Tuxtla Gutierrez, 425 miles southeast of
Mexico City, was partly designed to counter expanding Protestant
sects, which are finding fertile ground in the hopeless poverty of
the peasants and those who have moved to neighborhoods of shacks in
the cities.
   On Thursday, John Paul criticized family planning and
materialism as he hopscotched across northern Mexico, telling a
crowd of more than 500,000 that workers should not become cogs ``in
an immense production machine.''
   The crowd, the largest the pope had drawn on his eight-day trip
to Mexico, gathered Thursday evening in Monterrey, the nation's
third largest city, to hear a homily entitled ``The Sanctification
of Work.''
   ``Without denying the good results obtained ... where a free
system reigns,'' he said, ``we still cannot be blind to the defects
of an economic system that not infrequently makes riches and
consumption its principal engine.''
   The throng, gathered on a riverbed and surrounding hills, roared
and waved acres of flags and pennants as the pontiff spoke. Above
the altar was a billboard reading ``Welcome, John Paul II,''
flanked by two ads for Carta Blanca beer, one of the city's largest
industries.
   Earlier Thursday, in Chihuahua, John Paul criticized this
largely Roman Catholic country's family planning program, called
for freedom of religious education and demanded greater parental
input on sex education in public schools.
   The crowds in Chihuahua and Monterrey included many U.S.
residents; the two cities are respectively 225 and 100 miles from
the border with Texas.
   In Chihuahua, the pope launched an impassioned attack on
artificial contraception, a controversial issue in Mexico, which
has one of the Third World's most succesful family planning
programs and where the church is banned from taking political
positions.
   ``If, in the conjugal union, the possibility of conceiving a
child is artificially eliminated, the couple closed themselves to
God and opposed his will,'' John Paul said.
   On Wednesday, the pope had linked materialism and contraception
by saying that materialism is often the force behind population
control efforts.
   Mexico's family planning program has helped cut the population
growth rate from nearly 3.7 percent in 1977 to 1.9 percent,
according to government figures. Government health clinics
distribute contraceptives and perform vasectomies, but abortion is
illegal.
   Nearly half of married women use contraceptives, according to
International Planned Parenthood figures. Still, the population has
increased nearly 30 percent since John Paul first visited in 1979,
reaching 85 million.
   The pope's position has attracted hostile comments in a country
where infant mortality, illiteracy and malnutrition are severe
problems.

easy _ the cabinets are still here and the floor's OK _ for about
$5,000.''
   Gordon Valley is 200 bullet-riddled, low-cost apartments in a
seedy section of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. It's also the newest
stop on Ms. Hartman's daily _ and nightly _ patrols of her 11
low-cost apartment complexes.
   Wearing her bulletproof vest, Mrs. Hartman evicts drug users and
pushers, disperses loiterers and punishes litterers. She says it's
the only way to keep the ``good tenants.''
   During a visit in December, U.S. Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Jack Kemp praised Mrs. Hartman's anti-drug approach to
housing. But she says she will lose all her properties unless
someone in the government lends a hand.
   In a city where 20 percent of low-cost housing is substandard
and more than 700 people are on the Atlanta Housing Authority's
waiting list for openings, Ms. Hartman has a reputation as a firm
but just landlady.
   ``Ms. Hartman, she'll work with you,'' said Ann Parks, who has
lived at Oak Valley Court, a complex that won a federal Rental
Rehabilitation award, for a year. ``I help, though. When they fight
out here, I talk to both sides to try to stop it. I say this
neighborhood ought to get along together.''
   Ms. Hartman spends about $10,000 a month on 24-hour security for
the complexes. She has fenced in the largest, Overlook Atlanta,
where tenants say they now feel secure.
   ``One time, a lot of young kids would be hanging around the
corner all day, and you know what they were doing, with their gold
chains on and their cars with the gold trim,'' said Donna Dawson,
who has lived at the complex two years. ``Now, the tenants are real
proud at how clean it is.''
   Ms. Hartman doesn't believe she can stop drug trafficking. The
traffic from Overlook Atlanta simply moved across the street to a
convenience store, she says. And one dealer _ known to tenants as
Frog _ has managed to elude her.
   ``He was hassling me one day,'' Ms. Dawson said. ``He said he
was going to shoot me. But he's not as big as he'd like us to think
he is.'' Other dealers repeatedly have threatened her.
   Ms. Hartman, 41, bought her first low-cost complex eight years
ago. Three years later, she had 1,400 units throughout the city and
a 5 percent vacancy rate. Drug-related evictions have dropped her
occupancy rate to about 30 percent.
   She lost her own home and 122 units to foreclosure this year and
hasn't made mortgage payments on some complexes since January. She
expects a response on her request for federal aid, including a
moratorium on back payments, within the month. Without it, she says
she could lose everything.
   ``If I don't get the (mortgage) payments reduced, all the
efforts I've made, risking my life, all I've done for my tenants
and my kids will be for nothing because they will be boarded up
again,'' Ms. Hartman said.
   ``How could they allow 1,400 units to be slums again?''
   Ms. Hartman has $500,000 in federal funds to renovate Gordon
Valley, but no one will lend her the $700,000 more she needs. And
Mayor Maynard Jackson hasn't answered her proposal to house the
homeless in her projects instead of building more projects, as
Jackson has proposed.
   Ms. Hartman said she has always been a survivor. She left the
poor coal-mining town near St. Louis where she grew up with $60 and
no college education. She came to Atlanta, succeeded in real estate
and opened her own firm, Hartman Investment Co.
   ``I believe in what I'm doing. I know I can provide safe,
affordable housing for people,'' she said. ``If I give up, I lose
and they lose. If somebody would listen to me, we all could win.''

   The designer Mr. Blackwell, best known for
his annual worst-dressed celebrity lists, had his face redesigned
Friday.
   The 60-something-year-old designer underwent a $20,000
``complete face sculpturing,'' including cheekbone augmentation,
eye restoration, removal of silicone from previous cosmetic surgery
and regluing of his nose, said publicist Michael Sands.
   Regluing of his nose?
   Blackwell, whose real name is Richard Sylvan Seltzer, had a nose
job previously and it got out of line recently when he bumped his
schnoz, Sands said.
   Blackwell, who won't reveal his age except to say he's ``under
100,'' said in a telephone interview from the plastic surgeon's
office: ``You take in a dress if it's a little big, don't you?
Well, it's a little big.''
   The six-hour surgery was videotaped for airing on a medical
show, Sands said. ``We will have an unveiling later. He will look
like he did when he was young.''
   The caustic Blackwell, who in the past designed clothes for
Marilyn Monroe and Zsa Zsa Gabor, has heaped disdain on celebrity
fashion frumps for 30 years.

   Publicist Theo Cowen quoted the former Monty Python star as
saying the couple's two-year trial separation ``had gone so well
they decided to make it permanent.''
   Cleese, 50, did not contest the petition filed by Ms. Trentham,
44, according to the news agency Press Association. The couple had
no children.
   The two wed in 1981, three years after Cleese divorced Connie

   Sportscaster Brent Musburger says
journalists should bypass public relations people and go directly
to the source of stories.
   ``To me, the entire notion of ballclubs or individual players
issuing statements through public relations people is laughable,''
he told about 350 people at the University of Montana on Thursday
night.
   Musburger, who was fired by CBS last month and recently signed a
contract with ABC Sports, said he spoke from experience. When
journalists reported his firing, Musburger said, many accepted the
version presented by CBS spokesmen and failed to call him directly.
   Musburger was in Missoula this week to receive an honorary
doctorate of humane letters from the university. Musburger is a
Billings native and owns a ranch near Big Timber.

   Gov. Gaston Caperton and Rachael Worby,
conductor of the Wheeling Symphony, announced Friday they plan to
get married in a small ceremony later this month.
   The couple made the announcement at a news conference at Oglebay
Park Amphitheater, where the orchestra appears during the summer.
   Ms. Worby said she didn't think her first lady obligations would
affect her conducting duties.
   ``I intend to be music director for the Wheeling Symphony for as
long as everyone in the Ohio Valley wants me,'' she said.
   ``She'll do a great job, a great job,'' the Democratic governor
said.
   Ms. Worby said she plans to keep her name as well as her
Wheeling home. The governor's mansion is in Charleston.
   The announcement comes less than seven months after Caperton and
his wife, Dee, divorced. They had been married 23 years. Her fraud
lawsuit against him was settled for a reported $11 million.

   Filmmaker Spike Lee drew a crowd of 2,000 _
and a bomb threat _ for a lecture at the University of Georgia.
   Lee's informal talk at The Coliseum on Thursday night was
delayed about 45 minutes while police inspected the arena and found
nothing.
   ``This is my second bomb threat this year,'' Lee told the
students.
   Lee, director of films including ``Do The Right Thing'' and
``She's Gotta Have It,'' said he is starting to feel a bit put upon
by the media scrutiny.
   ``Because there are so few black filmmakers out there, I've been
elevated to this level of a messiah,'' he said. ``And I'm really
uncomfortable with that. It's not something I've asked for.''
   One student criticized Lee for endorsing a brand of athletic
shoes when some young people have been killed by thieves for their
expensive sneakers.
   ``In my heart, I have no problem endorsing a product I wear,''
Lee said.

   Nine-time Emmy-winning sports director Chet
Forte acknowledged he is a compulsive gambler after pleading
innocent Friday to federal tax and mail charges.
   Forte, 54, is accused of two counts of mail fraud, six counts of
transporting stolen property across state lines and failure to file
a federal income tax return in 1987. U.S. District Judge Joseph H.
Rodriguez set a July 2 trial date.
   Forte, who directed or produced ABC coverage of such events as
``Monday Night Football,'' the 1968 and 1984 Olympics and the World
Series, told reporters after the hearing that he has been unable to
find a job in the television industry because of his gambling
addiction.
   ``Gamblers don't wake up until it's too late,'' said Forte.
   Forte's attorney, Lawrence Lustberg, said his client's debts are
``in the million-dollar area.''
   Forte left ABC in 1987 to become an independent director and
producer.

<HEAD>Leading Party Quits Parliament to Protest Attacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the three leading parties
walked out of Romania's makeshift parliament Friday to protest
recent violent attacks on opposition leaders.
   The National Peasant Party's pullout symbolized the growing
tension before Romania's first free elections in more than 50
years, planned for May 20.
   Anti-government protesters seeking the resignation of former
Communists, including interim President Ion Iliescu, demonstrated
for the 20th straight day in downtown Bucharest. About 5,000
government supporters rallied a half-mile away.
   On Thursday, the United States announced it was recalling its
ambassador because of concerns the elections will not be entirely
free and fair.
   Ion Diaconescu, vice president of the Peasant Party, told a
session of the Provisional Council of National Unity, the interim
parliament, that his group was withdrawing its three deputies.
   Two other deputies joined the Peasant Party in the pullout. It
was prompted by opposition accusations that the dominant National
Salvation Front is behind recent attacks on its opponents and is
using its leading position to manipulate state funds and the media.
   In an afternoon session, parliament scrapped a 1978 decree that
placed the state radio and television under government control.
Opposition members have claimed the government has interfered with
independent broadcasting.
   Until the elections, radio and television will be subject to
control by the provisional parliament.
   The Peasant Party was one of Romania's main political parties
before World War II and claims to have attracted some 600,000
members since Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was ousted by a
popular revolt in December.
   On Wednesday, Ion Ratiu, the Peasants' candidate for president
in the May election, joined with another opposition leader, Radu
Campeanu of the National Liberal Party, in offering to withdraw
from the race.
   The two said they would pull out if Iliescu also withdrew and
agreed that the president be elected by the new parliament instead
of by direct ballot.
   Iliescu and his National Salvation Front are favored to win both
the presidential and parliamentary votes.
   In a letter made public Friday, Iliescu said the Front rejects
any monopoly on power and seeks a ruling coalition to steer Romania
out of its political and economic chaos.
   ``We don't claim to possess absolute truths, but we do not have
wonder solutions either,'' Iliescu said.
   He suggested that the Front, a loose coalition of intellectuals
and disaffected Communists, was the target of unfair accusations
that it seeks to re-establish Marxist rule.
   ``The anxiety felt by public opinion across the nation is caused
by exclusivist slogans, obsessively recited untruths and sincere or
fake fears apt to generate uncontrollable evolutions toward chaos
and violence,'' the 60-year-old interim leader said.
   Ratiu and Campeanu both have been physically attacked during
electoral rallies in southeastern Romania in the past two weeks.
   While they did not directly blame the Front for the attacks,
some Romanian newspapers said the assaults were meant to discourage
opposition and the electorate in the May vote, which is to be the
country's first free elections since 1937.
   The U.S. Embassy, in a statement issued Friday, said Ambassador
Alan Green was being called to Washington to give his account of
the campaign and underlined that fair, free elections were crucial
to developing good ties.

   Retail sales, held back by another big drop in
auto demand, fell 0.6 percent in April, the biggest setback in six
months, the government said Friday.
   The Commerce Department said sales fell to a seasonally adjusted
$148.64 billion last month after a 0.2 percent decline in March and
no change in February.
   Disappointed private economists, who had been hoping for a small
rebound in activity, warned that the lackluster sales would likely
translate into slower economic growth in the months ahead as
businesses face growing inventories of unsold products.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall
economic activity, has been the driving force during much of the
economic recovery in its eighth year, a record for peacetime.
   ``We have now had three months in a row of weak retail sales,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``The consumer
is fading from the scene.''
   Sandra Shaber, senior economist at the Futures Group, said that
at this stage of the recovery there is little pent-up demand left.
   ``The most disturbing trend here is the weakness in department
store sales. That's a pretty good indicator of the overall mood''
of consumers, she said.
   Analysts said that unless consumer spending weakens further, the
country should still be able to avoid a recession, although the
predicted overall growth as measured by the gross national product,
would expand at a sluggish pace of 2 percent this year.
   The 0.6 percent April decline in retail sales was the largest
monthly drop since a 1.4 percent plunge in October. The March and
April declines marked the first time retail sales have posted
consecutive monthly declines in almost three years.
   The biggest drag on activity came from auto sales, which dropped
2.7 percent. It marked the sixth time in the last seven months that
car sales have fallen. Analysts said that was particularly
worrisome because it was coming at a time when auto companies were
offering heavy incentives to reduce inventories.
   ``The consumer has clearly backed off,'' said David Wyss, an
economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, a consulting company in Lexington,
Mass. ``The incentives are costing car companies a lot of money and
sales are still weak.''
   Even without the big drop in car sales, spending in other retail
areas was weak.
   Sales at general department stores were off 0.7 percent in April
after an even bigger 1.2 percent drop in March. The late Easter had
been expected to boost sales in early April.
   Sales at hardware and building supply stores dropped 2.6 percent
in April after an 0.8 percent decrease the previous month.
   Sales at gasoline stations fell by 1 percent. Restaurant sales
were off by 0.2 percent, while sales at speciality clothing stores
were down 1.9 percent.
   In the only major areas showing gains, sales at furniture and
home furnishing stores edged up 0.4 percent while sales at drug
stores posted a 1.2 percent gain.

   From his vantage point on the edge of a
flood-swollen lake, Royce Fikes can look in a 360-degree circle and
see nothing but water.
   Fikes, 74, is a solitary sentry against a raging waterway _ the
Trinity River. The river was forced from its banks by record
flooding in north and east Texas that killed 12 people in the state
and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.
   Authorities in southeast Texas expect the river to crest there
next week.
   Fikes, a resident of the community of Sportsman's Paradise on
the upper end of Lake Livingston, about 80 miles north of Houston,
uses a boat to get around the flooded homes and trailers abandoned
there. Most of his neighbors have left, he said late Thursday.
   ``Some of us is trying to hang around and more or less try to
watch after the place,'' he said. Guarding against the ever-present
threat of looters, some using boats, is his big worry, he said.
   ``If the water gets up real far, we can cut the electricity
off,'' he said. Until then, he said, he watches television and
answers an occasional telephone call.
   His car is underwater, so when it's time to check out one of the
25 scattered homes in the development, he goes by boat.
   ``I have been going out fishing some, too,'' he said. ``But the
fish are not fighting too good. The water is too swift. I won't get
into that fast-moving water.''
   In another flood-stricken community near the lake, Vivian and
E.L. Butler are also prepared to flee their mobile home if they
feel endangered. The waters have reached her yard, but still are
not near her home, said Mrs. Butler.
   ``I'm naturally nervous and watching it real close and don't
intend to stay if it gets bad,'' she said.
   ``Right now I love it here and I wouldn't move unless it forces
me out,'' said Mrs. Butler, who retired to Sportsman's Paradise
with her husband.
   The Butlers are among a small group sticking it out on the
highest ground in the subdivision. The lakeside property has
flooded before, but this time, the waters are expected to keep the
area isolated for weeks.
   John Jadrosich of the Trinity River Authority said the region
from Lake Livingston south to Liberty, midway between Houston and
Beaumont, could be flooded throughout the summer and into the fall.
   Mrs. Butler said the couple has a boat standing ready with life
jackets, food and clothing in case they need to flee.
   ``I've put all my valuable papers and whatnot up in the bank.
I've got pictures and my Bible in a metal box to take in the boat
with me _ things that I don't want to lose,'' she said. ``We've
moved everything up off the floor in case the water gets up high.
We're just going to play it by ear.''
   Trinity County Judge Jimmie Thornton said he and other officials
also will patrol the area by boat to prevent looting.
   The lake is expected to reach about 7 feet above its normal
level, Thornton said. ``This flooding limit was designed for the
hundred year flood, and it looks like that's what we're getting,''
he said.

   Here is the transcript of President Bush's
question and answer session with reporters aboard Air Force One
today.
   President Bush: I'm certainly looking forward to this visit to
Texas.
   Q: Well maybe you could help us.
   Q: We need help.
   A: I'm not sure I can help anybody.
   Q: There seems to be so much confusion these days over what your
lips are reading on the subject of taxes.
   A: Well, why don't you just listen to what I say and see what we
do. And there's no subject _ the question is there's no conditions.
That's the way it is, that's the way it's going to be, and that's
the way it must be. And so people can talk all day long, pointing
prematurely to discussion of one subject or another, and I'll
simply repeat that I have made this proposal that we meet with no
conditions, and that's exactly the way it's going to be.
   And we're hearing comments from you people _ by that I mean
astute journalists _ wanting to probe beyond where I'm ready to
speak. We're hearing comments from the political left, middle,
center, right. And my position is: I've made this offer to sit down
in good faith and talk with no conditions, and that's exactly the
way it's going to be.
   Q: Did your chief of staff accurately reflect your posture,
though, when he said. ...
   A: I would ask you to reflect my posture to talk about what I
say, and I've spelled it out just as well as I possibly can, just
as clearly. And tomorrow there'll be a flap on something else, and
the next day a flap on something else. But I am determined to
address this problem in good faith in the way I've told you. So I
would respectfully suggest you take your guidance from me on this
one, because that's the way it is.
   Q:How are you going to be able to get to Mars in 30 years since
we're hobbled by. ...
   A: (With a laugh) Going to have to go fairly fast, it's a long
way out there.
   Q: How about financially, how are you going to do it?
   A: Well 30 years is a long time.
   Q: Did Speaker Foley seem concerned yesterday when you talked to
him? Is he getting conflicting signals?
   A: Yeah, you know, I keep reading that I called Foley to talk
about this, but then, in fairness to Foley, he explained the way it
was. I wasn't concerned about that, and he was. Yes, he did express
concern, and I think he expressed it at a press conference. But I
think he sees the need to go forward on the basis I have called
for, and I respect him for that.
   Q: Mr. President, is it your posture that if taxes are to be
discussed. ...
   A: Look, Frank, you can come at me all day long. That would not
be dealing in good faith to _ to _- if I started going into these
details. I'm not going to do it.
   Q: Let me ask you one other. ...- A: Nice try!
   Q: Do you feel that it's inevitable that the Gramm-Rudman
targets are going to have to be stretched out in this process, that
the budget cannot. ...
   A: I'm approaching this with the idea that we can, if everybody
comes together, we can solve some significant problems out there.
So I'm not prejudging anything.
   Q: Do you still think the budget can be balanced by '93?
   A: Well, I think this is certainly an objective, and we want to
go forward and deal in good faith. And I think everyone realizes
something ought to be done, so let's see if we can get something
done. But, you know, I don't contribute to it if I start talking
about my approach or what I think is the right way to do it and try
to dictate to anybody. But I'll be there with no preconditions, and
then we'll have a good negotiating team and see where we go.
   So tomorrow there'll be another tidal wave, so keep your snorkel
above the water level and do what you think is right. It goes back
to what my mom taught me when I was about six: Do your best, do
your best. Well, I'm trying hard to stay calm. ...- Q: Mr.
President?
   A: Yes?
   Q: Is Governor Sununu in trouble?
   A: (With a chuckle) This so silly! This is so stupid! (Scattered
laughter.) None of these congressmen are in trouble, either. I'm
approaching it in _ very openly, and I recognize there's
controversy swirling around from one statement or another. But
look, stay on track; stay steady as she goes and be open, deal
frankly with people, and to deal in the way I said: no
preconditions. That doesn't _ I'm not going to show you my hand,
and I haven't seen a lot of hands being laid down up on the Hill,
but that's the way it ought to be. If we're going to get anywhere,
there's some tough decisions out there and we've got to discuss
them, discuss everything.
   Q: Has the deficit problem degenerated to the point that it
really presents the country with almost an economic crisis
situation?
   A: No, I wouldn't say that at all. I noticed the very salutary
prediction yesterday about continued growth from some of the
leading financial experts in the country. And so that's good. We're
not dealing in a crisis mentality. But we've got a major deficit
problem, and we've got a law that says where it has to be, the
deficit. And I'm determined to fulfill my obligations to comply
with that law. But we're going to need cooperation because isn't
going to be easy. It's going to be very difficult, and people will
be charged and countercharged, but you can't be thin-skinned in a
business like this. I can't react to every charge or some
flamboyant congressman up there blasting me. I mean that's not _ I
don't think that's the way a president should conduct himself.
   Q:Do you have any message for the 19 senators who wrote you or
the conservatives who. ...
   A: No. Say _ hey, listen. Say what you think. Democrats,
Republicans, leaders, back-benchers, columnists, anybody. Say what
you think. But I think the president has a certain responsibility
to stay cool and make clear to people that he's dealing in good
faith, and do my best. And that's exactly what I intend to do. And
I can't be ruffled by these things, or I've got to be understanding
when people come forward and express themselves forcefully on
something or other.
   Q Would you call on the American people now and prepare them
somehow to share the sacrifice, to take the steps. ...
   A: Well, I think we've got to _ if we can hammer out a deal, I
certainly will make clear that we support it. So, let's wait and
see what happens.
   Q: Is there any way out of this without raising revenues?
   A: We'll see what happens. We'll just go there and discuss
everything. That's the way we're going to do it. Open agenda. Open.
And that's the only way you can get strong-willed people to the
table, in good faith. And that's the way it will be.
   Q: Do you have a timetable. ...
   A: And now if I'd only get going, I might get to Texas A&amp;I
before you guys do, or a little later. (Laughter.)
   President Bush: I hope I've been able to clarify all this for
you. Thank you. ...

the solar system on the way to its 1995 exploration of Jupiter,
fired its thrusters today in a major maneuver meant to steer it
near Earth late this year.
   ``We're trying to reshape the trajectory slightly so we move
closer and closer to our aim point near Earth on Dec. 8,'' said
Neal Ausman, mission director at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Galileo's tiny rocket thrusters, which are small enough to fit
in the palm of a hand, started firing at 11:10 a.m. PDT and will
fire roughly 3,000 times by the time the maneuver ends Saturday
afternoon, laboratory spokesman Jim Wilson said.
   The two-day maneuver will slow the spacecraft, which was
traveling about 66,000 mph earlier today, by about 25 mph. It also
will gradually alter its direction, Ausman said.
   It is the second of three or four maneuvers needed to bring
Galileo within 1,000 miles of Earth, which will act as a gravity
slingshot to help expand the spacecraft's orbit around the sun and
propel it toward Jupiter, he added. Without maneuvers, the
spacecraft would miss Earth by 1.5 million miles.
   As of today, Galileo was 96 million miles from Earth, but has
traveled a looping path of 365 million miles since it was launched
from space shuttle Atlantis last Oct. 18. Its trip to Jupiter will
total 2.4 billion miles.
   Galileo will make a second swing past Earth in December 1992. It
flew past Venus in another gravity slingshot maneuver on Feb. 9.
   In July 1995, the spacecraft separates into a 4,890-pound
orbiter and a 760-pound probe. They are scheduled to reach Jupiter,
the solar system's largest planet, on Dec. 7, 1995.
   The probe will plunge into the planet's atmosphere, relaying
measurements to the orbiter before the probe is destroyed by
intense atmospheric pressure. The orbiter will spend at least two
years studying and taking snapshots of Jupiter and its major moons
Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
250,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for delivery
next month, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was sold by two
private companies, which will receive subsidies under the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Dickerson said 313,950 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation. Only wheat has been approved for
sale to the Soviets under the price subsidy program.
   The seventh year of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement began Oct.
1. With the latest sales, the Soviet Union has bought more than 3.5
million tons of wheat for 1989-90 delivery and 13.3 million tons of
corn, plus soybeans and soybean meal. All of the wheat was sold
under EEP arrangements.
   In 1988-89, the sixth year of the agreement, the Soviet Union
bought about 5.4 million tons of wheat and more than 16.3 million
tons of corn, plus soybeans, soybean meal and grain sorghums. All
but about 700,000 tons of the wheat was bought under EEP.
   A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 250,000 tons are equal to nearly 9.2 million bushels
worth about $32 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $18.18 per
ton, or about 50 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest wheat was sold by Cargill Inc.,
185,000 tons; and Central States Enterprises, 65,000 tons.

   A little church that bought seven crack
houses to turn them into affordable apartments has received praise
from the federal drug czar but still needs more than $62,000 to
complete its task.
   ``We have borrowed to our capacity. We can't borrow any more,''
said Benjamin Edwards Jr., executive treasurer of Third Shiloh
Missionary Baptist Church. ``If we didn't put up our own money I
could understand. But we put up our own money.''
   A year ago, the church voted to use its own $175,000 building
fund _ 20 years' worth of church dinners, car washes and Sunday
collection offerings _ to buy the abandoned duplex houses.
   The 25-year-old cinderblock church is buckling, and Edwards
figures it will last only three to four years at best. But across
the street, four unfinished duplexes testify to work put in by the
church, which has about 80 active members and 220 others who show
up for occasional services.
   More than 80 families have signed up for the 14 unfinished units.
   ``We have people stopping here every day who want to rent the
apartments. But we just had to stop taking applications,'' said
Edwards.
   Third Shiloh hopes to have the first two duplexes finished by
early June. ``We're rolling around the clock. We're working up to
10 at night, then coming out at 4, 5 in the morning to try to get
it completed,'' Edwards said.
   ``When you all bought those houses and nailed them up and fixed
them up, I said, `Oh, boy, what a relief,''' Benjamin Brown, an
elderly man who lives across from the church, told Edwards.
   Four of the houses are on Piety Street, separated only by a
chain-link fence from the Desire housing project _ one of the
city's worst.
   Brown and Oscar Robertson, whose house is next door to the
church, said that two summers ago their street was full of people
buying or selling cocaine. After a particularly rough Fourth of
July weekend, police SWAT teams hauled out many of the dealers and
patrolled the area, Brown and Robertson said.
   ``Police were walking out here with rifles on their backs like
it was Vietnam,'' said Robertson.
   When the church decided to buy the houses last year, it
estimated it would cost about $240,000 to purchase and renovate
them. It borrowed $71,000 in addition to its building fund and
began work.
   Church members cut down the 6-foot-high weeds that had grown
around the houses. They hauled away stairs to make it harder for
vandals to get into the houses, which stand on 4{-foot pilings to
be safe from floods. Concrete foundations were dug and poured.
   Much of the work is being done by volunteers, helped out by
formerly unemployed workers who say they will work for whatever
wages the church can pay them. The contractor, a former member of
the church, has deferred payment until the project is done, Edwards
said.
   The houses turned out to need a lot more work than first
thought, Edwards said. The roofs and many walls had to be replaced.
The houses also held tiny one- and two-bedroom apartments, with
kitchens hardly big enough to turn around in. The congregation
decided to build 25-foot-long additions to each building, doubling
the kitchen floor space and adding a bedroom and utility room to
each apartment.
   Edwards estimated this week that the church needs at least
$62,500 to complete the work.
   The church has applied for $72,000 in federal renovation money _
the maximum it is eligible to apply for. But Edward said he hasn't
heard anything.
   Edwards does have a nice note of from federal drug czar William
Bennett, along with a page from a speech in which he commended the
church as an example of the sort of private initiative needed to
fight drugs.
   The Hearst Foundation has given $10,000, Freeport McMoRan Inc.
$2,500 and the Riley Foundation $5,000, with an offer of $5,000
more if the church can find an equal amount. But all other
contributions from outside the congregation have been from private
citizens.

   The late Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, was
honored Friday as only a senator could be: A table in the Senators'
Dining Room in the Capitol was named in his memory.
   The Senate adopted a resolution designating the ``Spark M.
Matsunaga Table'' to memorialize his ``exemplary diligence,
legendary warmth, compassion, courage and firm devotion to American
ideals.''
   During his 13 years in the Senate, Matsunaga provided a service
to constituents that visitors from other states could only envy. He
personally tried to provide a guided tour of the Capitol to every
visiting Hawaiian and to take them to lunch at the center table in
the Senators' Dining Room.
   Matsunaga died of cancer last month.

   There won't be any walk down the aisle, organ music
or kissing at the altar when the emperor's youngest son ties the
knot next month. His imperial parents aren't even invited.
   But there will be rice _ of the fermented, drinkable sort _ and
plenty of pomp.
   In one of the final formalities before the ceremony, imperial
messenger Yasuo Shigeta, dressed in a gray morning coat and
carrying a silk top hat, called on Prince Aya's fiancee, Kiko
Kawashima, and her parents at their home Friday to inform them the
royal nuptials will be June 29.
   Miss Kawashima lives with her parents and younger brother in an
apartment on the campus of Gakushuin University. She is a student
of psychology at the university, and her father, Tatsuhiko, teaches
economics there.
   Gakushuin is also Aya's alma mater and is where he met the
23-year-old Kiko.
   Aya, 24, will be the first imperial family member to marry since
Emperor Akihito's cousin, Prince Norihito, wed in December 1984.
Aya is next in line to the throne after his brother, Crown Prince
Naruhito, who is 30 and has yet to choose a bride.
   The marriage date was unofficially selected soon after Aya's
engagement received unanimous approval in September by the Imperial
Household Council, a 10-member body headed by Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu.
   Details of how the government plans to conduct the wedding and
parties afterward, for which it has alloted roughly $1 million,
remained vague until a palace announcement this month.
   The short ceremony will begin at mid-morning at a shrine to the
sun goddess Amaterasu, from whom legend says the imperial line
descends.
   Like most of the wooded palace behind a moat and closely guarded
gates, few commoners have ever seen the wooden shrines, which are
looked after by the emperor's private ritualists.
   The newlyweds, wearing silk robes similar to ancient court
attire, will be joined in marriage by sipping sacred rice wine from
a lacquered cup.
   In the afternoon, they will formally greet the emperor and
Empress Michiko at the palace and inform them of the marriage.
   Kaifu, top government officials and other domestic dignitaries
and foreign ambassadors will be invited to palace receptions the
following day. Members of the old peerage will gather at the palace
July 1. Palace officials refuse to disclose the number of guests
who will be invited.
   For those well-wishers whose station in life does not warrant an
invitation, a register will be set up outside the palace.
   After a reception for friends and classmates of the couple is
held July 2, Aya and his bride will travel to the Grand Shrines of
Ise, the center of sun goddess worship in Japan's indigenous Shinto
religion.
   They will also pay their respects at the tomb of Aya's
grandfather, the late Emperor Hirohito, and Japan's first emperor,
Jimmu, who according to myth ascended in 660 B.C.
   In hopes that other young couples may want to imitate the royal
pair, a Tokyo kimono school has begun renting a $320,000 kimono
patterned after the 12-layered one Miss Kawashima will wear.
   Getting into the bulky garment, which weighs about 50 pounds,
can take up to three hours.
   For the past two years Aya has been studying zoology _ he has a
particular interest in catfish _ at Britain's Oxford University,
and he is not expected to return to Japan until less than two weeks
before the ceremony.

<HEAD>Census: Cities Contemplate New Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of major cities are considering
filing a second lawsuit against the Census Bureau over what they
fear will be serious omissions in this year's national head count.
   Hulbert James, an assistant to New York Mayor David Dinkins,
said Friday that there have been serious discussions of such a
lawsuit because of potential differences between census counts and
those of local governments.
   James' comments came after a meeting of the census committee of
the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
   Jessica Heinz of the Los Angeles city attorney's office said
talk of a new lawsuit may be premature, although her city also has
concerns about differences with the bureau.
   Lance Simmens, a staff members of the mayor's group, speculated
that the census undercount could climb to 15 percent. In 1980, only
about 1.4 percent of Americans were not counted.
   Peter Bounpane, deputy census director, promptly disputed the
Simmens' figure and said the comment was not appropriate.
   ``The census isn't over yet,'' Bounpane said.
   ``We had a plan and we are still following it. The only thing
that happened is that fewer people mailed back than budgeted, which
means we have to hire more people and spend more money,'' he said.
   The bureau had anticipated 70 percent of Americans would respond
by mail, and so far only 63 percent have done so. That means an
extra $180 million or more to hire people to go door-to-door, a
process that is expected to continue for several weeks.
   James echoed Bounpane's comment that the count is not over, and
said many city officials are engaged in efforts to encourage their
residents to cooperate with census takers.
   One concern, James said, is to make sure that city and census
officials cooperate during the census follow-up that will start in
late summer _ especially in asking people if they were counted and
finding those who were missed.
   Procedures for that cooperation, and making sure that the census
bureau has done everything possible to count everyone, could be the
focus of the new lawsuit, James said.
   A pending suit filed by several local governments wants to
require that the final figures be adjusted to include people who
were missed. A new suit would be separate, James said, focusing on
the counting process rather than adjustment.

<HEAD>Bush Aide Rejects Soviet Arms Offer; Naval Chief Hints at Interest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior U.S. arms control negotiator Friday
rejected a Soviet plea for talks on cutting tactical nuclear
weapons at sea, although the Navy's chief officer told Congress
such negotiations ``could be in our interests.''
   The top arms adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
told Congress on Tuesday that future talks on other nuclear and
conventional weapons could be derailed by continued U.S. resistence
to naval arms talks.
   Ronald Lehman, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency, told a Senate panel that the Soviets had not formally
insisted on linking naval weapons with other arms, even though
Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev raised it before Congress, and so the
United States isn't compelled to respond.
   ``We have come to the conclusion that now is not the time'' to
address the issue, said Lehman.
   Lehman said the administration remained optimistic it could
reach agreement with Moscow on the main provisions of a treaty
cutting long-range nuclear weapons before Gorbachev arrives in
Washington May 30 for a summit meeting. The U.S. has said progress
on the treaty has slowed in recent weeks.
   ``We see no reason why we shouldn't be able to get an
agreement'' next week when Secretary of State James A. Baker III
meets Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Moscow, said
Lehman.
   Gorbachev proposed at his meeting with Bush in Malta last
December that the superpowers negotiate cuts in short-range naval
nuclear arms, but the administration has resisted. Bush has said
such cuts would undermine America's position as the predominant
maritime power.
   Lehman said the Bush administration saw no way negotiated
reductions in short-range naval nuclear arms _ mainly torpedoes,
depth bombs and anti-ship missiles _ would strengthen U.S.
security. He said it could instead harm the security of U.S. allies.
   ``We've spent a lot of time studying it and we just haven't
found it'' to be in U.S. interests, Lehman told the Armed Services
subcommittee on projection forces.
   But Adm. Carlisle A. H. Trost, chief of Naval operations, took a
different approach. Although he expressed doubt about Soviet
intentions in pursuing such negotiations, Trost said he could
contemplate eliminating all tactical naval nuclear arms if related
weapons such as bombers assigned to naval fleets also were banned.
   ``If we could, with proper confidence in their willingness to
abide by an agreement, be sure there were no nuclear weapons that
threatened either side's ships at sea, I'm sure we'd both be more
comfortable that way,'' Trost told the panel.
   Later, under questioning by Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, who
said he opposed such negotiations, Trost said he was referring only
to the tactical category of naval weapons, not to sea-based cruise
or ballistic missiles of longer range.
   ``Yes, it could be in our interests if all the `ifs' I
previously stated are included,'' Trost said, quickly adding, ``And
you could label me as a lifetime pessimist on the likelihood of
ever concluding such an agreement.''
   Trost is due to retire at the end of June.
   Trost's description of an acceptable formula for talks to
eliminate short-range nuclear arms at sea appeared similar to that
offered Tuesday by Akhromeyev, who said his government was willing
to include related weaponry such as that carried on aircraft
carriers, submarines and land-based naval aircraft.
   Joshua Handler, an arms analyst with Greenpeace U.S.A., which
advocates the elimination of all nuclear weapons, said Trost's
comments departed from the Navy's past unconditional opposition to
talks on tactical nuclear arms.
   Trost and Lehman both stressed the administration has been
willing to negotiate certain measures short of cutting tactical
naval arms. Lehman cited a 1988 agreement to provide advance notice
of all launches of strategic ballistic missiles, whether from land
or sea.
   ``It isn't that we're stonewalling,'' on naval nuclear arms,
Trost said.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the subcommittee, said
he could not understand why the administration was willing to deal
in all areas of arms control except naval.
   ``Why aren't we prepared even to talk'' with the Soviets? he
asked.

   Blasts of air from high winds and a jet blew a

Friday, authorities said. No injuries were reported.
   The two-engine commuter plane, operated by American Eagle, was
crossing behind a Northwest Airlines Boeing 747 that was waiting to

official.
   The smaller plane was flung nose-first into a blast fence, but
the only two people aboard, the pilot and co-pilot, walked away and
did not require medical attention, authorities said.
   The plane did not turn over, as reported initially by airport
authorities.
   The jumbo jet took off.
   The accident occurred at 12:35 p.m., when wind speed was 30 to
45 mph, authorities said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has begun an
investigation, said Benczik.

   The desecration of a Jewish cemetery and mutilation
of a corpse horrified the nation Friday, reawakening memories of
the Holocaust and fueling fears of a resurgence of racism.
   The French Senate and National Assembly suspended their sessions
for 15 minutes, and leaders of all major religious faiths condemned
the desecration. Special radio and TV shows were planned, and some
channels devoted their entire evening newscasts to the subject.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe said extreme right-wing leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen must take some responsibility for the crime.
   But Le Pen denounced the desecration as ``barbaric'' and said it
was likely a sham staged to disgrace him and his National Front, a
party that has won 15 percent support in recent opinion polls.
   Politicians across the political spectrum made pilgrimages to
the town of Carpentras, near Avignon, where Jews first settled in
the first century. Mourners on Thursday found 34 graves desecrated
and the body of an 81-year-old man dug up and impaled on an
umbrella.
   Police detained one man for questioning but provided no details.
``We are making verifications. Don't draw any conclusions,'' an
officer said.
   Families of the dead held an impromptu religious service at the
cemetery, and Jewish demonstrators gathered at the gate under the
banner: ``We Will Not Let History Repeat Itself.''
   ``They impaled Felix, my husband,'' wept Magdeleine Germon.
``They merit being impaled themselves,'' she said. ``Since he was
the last buried, they took their revenge on the freshest grave. To
impale a dead person. Can you imagine what hate one must have!''
   Her husband, buried less than a month ago, was found sprawled
across a neighboring tomb stone, impaled on an umbrella stick. A
star of David pulled from another grave lay nearby. Grave markers
had been knocked over and flower pots trampled.
   ``It is an aggression against all humanity, a barbarous and
bestial act,'' said Israeli Ambassador Obadia Soffer, who visited
the cemetery. ``It is also a warning to all civilization for
humanity. ... This is a racist act of the first order.''
   Police said fingerprints and footprints indicated at least four
vandals took part in the desecration, discovered when several
mourners visited the cemetery to lay flowers.
   A previously unknown group calling itself the ``Mohamed El
Boukima Group'' claimed responsibility for the crime in an
anonymous phone call to a newspaper. Police said they were trying
to authenticate the call.
   Racism has for years been a major issue in France, which is home
to more than 4 million immigrants, many from former African
colonies.
   Racism recently returned to the forefront with a series of
attacks on Moslems, and it presents the biggest political hurdle
for the Socialist government of Premier Michel Rocard.
   Le Pen's party wants to deport immigrants, and some center-right
politicians have taken up the call for tight curbs on immigration.
   Twenty tombstones recently were overturned at an Israeli
cemetery in Strasbourg, the Jewish community there reported Friday,
and swastikas were found scrawled on walls in the town of
Rambouillet.
   Serge Klarsfeld, a well-known lawyer and Nazi hunter, said the
Carpentras desecration was unprecedented. Even during World War II,
he said, the Nazis left Jewish graves alone.
   Joxe called Le Pen ``racist and provocateur.''
   ``Like all racists, like all who express their anti-Semitism in
an explicit or implicit fashion, he is obviously one of those
responsible ... because of all that has been inspired by racist
hate for years,'' Joxe said.
   Le Pen, who has been convicted of making racist remarks,
rejected the claim, saying: ``I don't feel guilty at all.'' He
suggested that Communists or subversive Moslem fundamentalists were
behind the desecration.
   ``The pretended rise in anti-Semitism and racism is a political
sham,'' he said. ``The Carpentras operation is that of political
manipulation.''
   At the very least, Le Pen said, politicians were exploiting the
event.
   President Francois Mitterrand urged France to ``get hold of
itself.''
   ``There is an unhealthy climate in France, a racist climate,''
said Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, visiting Carpentras.
``It's ballooning, it's heating up, it's becoming more and more
dangerous.''
   ``French society must now examine its conscience and urgently,''
he said.

   A parade of dignitaries arrived on a
solemn pilgrimage Friday after vandals desecrated Jewish graves in
the town that is home to France's oldest synagogue.
   ``The choice of Carpentras wasn't an accident,'' businessman
Jacques David said. ``It was picked as a symbol.''
   Israel's ambassador to France, mayors of nearby cities, Cabinet
ministers and political party leaders made their way to the
cemetery to inspect the damage and pay their respects to the dead.
   ``The dead will judge us,'' said Elie Weisel, winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize for his writings about the Holocaust.
   Located in southern France, about 350 miles south of Paris,
Carpentras has been a haven for Jews since the 13th century, when
they enjoyed protection under papal rule and were free to worship
as they chose.
   Recent archaeological discoveries have revealed the presence of
Jews in the region hundreds of years earlier.
   In 1967, scientists working on a site near Cavaillon unearthed
an oil lamp decorated with a seven-branch candelabra. According to
French historian Rene Moulinas, the lamp is the oldest vestige of
Judaism in France, dating ``probably to the end of the year 1 B.C.''
   The 15th century synagogue is now a classified historical
monument, known for its spire, ritual baths and an oven dating from
the Middle Ages and used to bake the unleavened bread eaten by Jews
at Passover.
   After the French Revolution when Jews received citizenship, they
moved away from the area and settled in other parts of France.
   Today, the synagogue is hardly used for religious worship _
Carpentras' Jewish community is too small to have its own rabbi.
The town's 26,000 inhabitants include about 100 Jewish families,
many of them immigrants from North Africa.
   The mayor, Jean-Claude Andrieu, described Carpentras as a
tranquil town in which the Jews lived harmoniously. The vandals
must have been outsiders, several residents said.
   Families of the dead held an impromptu religious service at the
cemetery, and Jewish demonstrators gathered at the gate under the
banner: ``We Will Not Let History Repeat Itself.''
   ``This wasn't a crime against the Jews. This was a crime against
all humanity,'' said Dr. Freddy Haddad, leader of the local Jewish
community.

   About 50,000 villagers were without food
and water for the second day Friday after the decade's worst
cyclone battered towns on India's southern coast, killing at least
210 people.
   The cyclone roared in from the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday and
swept inland Thursday, swamping 100 villages, flattening thousands
of houses and affecting more than 2 million people. The storm
weakened Friday.
   ``Forget food, there is even no drinking water,'' said a relief
official in Machilipatnam, one of the worst-hit areas.``By
conservative estimate, at least 50,000 people have nothing to eat
and drink.''
   Village wells were unusable, brimming with sea water swept in
with the cyclone.
   ``We planned to drop water bottles along with food packets, but
none of the 12 helicopters could take off today due to bad
weather,'' said Arjuna Rao, the top relief official in Andhra
Pradesh state, which bore the brunt of high winds, heavy rains and
tidal waves.
   Rao said at least 200 people died in the state. ``The toll will
be higher as more and more bodies are surfacing every hour,'' Rao
said.
   In neighboring Tamil Nadu state, 10 people died.
   Most of the deaths occurred when walls collapsed or flood waters
carried people away. Some people died when they were struck by
falling live electric wires.
   Many towns and villages were also still without electricity
because the storm ripped out power lines. Trains stopped running,
and about 100 telephone exchanges were damaged.
   A 1977 cyclone in the region, although less intense, left more
than 10,000 people dead. This time, early satellite warnings
resulted in the quick evacuation of 150,000 people, officials said.
   A mobile telephone exchange with a satellite link was sent to
Krishna district, where the entire telecommunications network had
broken down.
   Troops and medical teams were in the affected areas. A team of
army engineers with mechanized boats and pumping sets were on way
to Vijayawada and Machilipatnam towns which were still under
waist-deep water.
   Road communication between the two towns was restored, but in
most other places it was disrupted because of flooding. Thousands
of uprooted trees littered highways.
   News Reports said large tracts of rice, a major crop of the
region, were badly damaged. Commercial mango and banana gardens
also were affected.

<HEAD>East Germans Cashing Life Insurance Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many East Germans are cashing in their life
insurance so they can have more savings on hand when their money is
converted to West German marks, the government said Friday.
   Long lines have formed at state insurance bureaus in recent days
because East Germans believe they will get a better exchange rate
on cash than on insurance, the official news agency ADN said.
   Cash savings up to $2,440 for most East Germans will be
converted at a 1-1 rate, while insurance policies are expected to
be converted at a 2-1 rate to the West German mark.
   Many also fear dissolution of the state insurance system after
the two Germanys merge their economies.
   The state insurance office on Wednesday asked that a 1-1
conversion be granted for East German insurance policies.
   Experts from the German states are negotiating a state treaty
under which their economies and social institutions are to be
joined by July 2.
   East Germany will move to a free market economy, which will
replace the 4-decade-old socialist system that heavily subsidizes
food, housing and employment.
   Prices and unemployment already are increasing as Western
products flood into East Germany. East Germany is trying to
negotiate some job and social benefit guarantees during the
transition to a market economy.
   East Germans pay about the same amount of money for their
monthly rent _ sometimes as low as $38 per month _ as a West German
pays for two tanks of gasoline.
   An East German official said Friday that some price controls on
rents must be maintained.
   ``The prevailing income structure in (East Germany) makes rent
price maintenance absolutely necessary,'' said Ingemar Axel
Viehweger, minister for housing and construction.
   ``Too hasty steps in this sensitive area will only imperil the
real income of the citizens during the monetary union,'' he said.
   He proposed a gradual adjustment of rents to market prices,
taking into consideration income and actual costs for upkeep and
management of apartments.
   Unification with West Germany has been fueled by East Germany's
decrepit economy, eroded by the exodus of East Germans to West
Germany and poor economic planning by the ousted Communist
government.
   Large numbers of East German factories are expected to close
when they are forced to compete with more efficient Western
businesses that produce better quality goods.
   East Germans already swarm across the borders, opened in
November, to buy West German food and clothing. Border crossings
are typically packed with returning East Germans toting huge
satchels stuffed with groceries.
   East Germany's beleaguered shoe industry, where in recent weeks
workers have held one-hour strikes to protest Western imports, said
it would cut prices and try to improve quality to compete with the
West, ADN said Friday.
   Tens of thousands of teachers, textile workers and farmers
staged protests and strikes Thursday to demand protection from the
unemployment expected as East Germany moves to a free market.
   Hans Klein, spokesman for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
said the organizers of the strikes were former Communists who ``are
to some extent exactly the forces who caused'' East Germany's dire
economic problems.
   Klein told a news conference in the West German capital, Bonn,
that there was legitimate ``uncertainty and fear'' over talks
between the Germanys on the merger of their economies and social
institutions.

<HEAD>US Probes Alleged Harassment of Dissidents by Chinese Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government has been investigating
allegations that Chinese officials have been harassing Chinese
students in the United States who are critical of the Beijing
government, the State Department said Friday.
   The department's statement followed allegations by a defector
from the Chinese Embassy who reported that embassy officers were
ordered to intimidate critics.
   The comments of the defector, Xu Lin, appeared in Friday's
editions of The Washington Post.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that as the
investigations proceed, ``we will continue to take appropriate
action to afford Chinese students here the full protection of
United States law.
   ``We have advised the Chinese government on several occasions
that harassment of its citizens in the United States would violate
our laws and would damage our bilateral relationship,'' she said.
   When he defected last week, Xu, a third secretary at the
embassy, took documents which he claimed proved the extent of
Beijing's crackdown on dissidents.
   They are purported to show an effort by the embassy to isolate
and stigmatize about 100 ``ringleaders'' who have been involved in
the campaign against the communist leadership in Beijing.
   ``To strike the ringleaders, we should give them a bad name,''
the Post quoted one of the documents as saying. ``Now we must think
of a name that has a resounding effect; we cannot use the word
dissident.''
   The documents classify the students under five headings, ranging
from loyal communists to the ``reactionary core elements who
actively organize and plan anti-government activities.''
   Tactics to be used against the dissidents, the documents
suggested, could include keeping files on them, revoking passports,
cutting off government stipends, firing them from their jobs back
in China and isolating them from their families at home.
   President Bush has signed an executive order promising that
Chinese students in the United States will not be forced to return
home against their will.
   More than 50,000 government-sponsored exchange students are
studying in the United States and Canada, and the documents said 70
percent to 80 percent of them would not return to China were
harassed, the Post said.
   A Chinese Embassy spokesman told the newspaper that the
allegations in the documents were ``rumors.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Going Ahead With Radar-Jammers Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Pentagon official on Friday defended a
revived $7 billion program to build radar jammers for military
aircraft even though he canceled the plan last year with the
approval of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood also confirmed that
the Air Force, which proposed termination of the public program and
dropped out of it because of budget constraints, is working on a
separate, classified version.
   The Pentagon's deputy inspector general, speaking to the same
congressional panel that Atwood addressed, said later that the
system's effectiveness was unproven, and he recommended delaying
production decisions until tests are completed.
   Atwood was questioned, at a hearing by a Senate Governmental
Affairs subcommittee, about a newly disclosed July 1989 memorandum
in which he proposed terminating the airborne self-protection
jammer program.
   ``I originally killed the program based on the fact that the Air
Force recommended it be killed. Secretary Cheney then approved''
the termination, he said.
   That public effort, a Navy-Air Force program, has now been
revived by the Navy alone. And Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman
of the subcommittee, disclosed the existence of a secret Air Force
program.
   ``This is one of the old shell game tricks,'' Pryor told Atwood.
``You don't get a program ... or it's not working, you simply put
in, as they say, a `black program,' which is a top secret program.''
   ``The Congress really has no control over this,'' he said. ``We
don't get to ask questions.''
   The Pentagon envisions that the electronic system, to be
installed on more than 2,000 Navy and Air Force aircraft, would
increase the survivability of the planes by jamming or deceiving an
enemy's radar-controlled weapons.
   Atwood said he changed his mind on cancellation of the program
after the Navy appealed the decision and vowed that changes would
be incorporated into the system.
   ``I said all right as far as the Navy was concerned and then
Cheney approved that and that was in our budget,'' Atwood said.
   Shortly after the deputy defense secretary's testimony, the
Pentagon's own deputy inspector general told the panel that a
recent department audit raised serious questions about the jammer
system.
   ``The effectiveness and suitability in combat has not been
proven,'' said Derek Vander Schaaf.
   The audit also found that the Navy's plans call for buying 436
of the jammers before operational tests and evaluation are
completed and said that the overall cost estimates may be $1.6
billion too low.
   The department's own cost analysis and improvement group
estimates that the program may cost about $9 billion.
   Based on this information, Vander Schaaf recommended that the
department delay decisions on production until tests are completed
and delivery of 100 jammers be stretched out.
   Robert Duncan, director of operational tests and evaluation at
the Pentagon, said he expects the tests on the jammer to begin in
May 1991 and be completed by October 1991.
   But Vander Schaaf said he believes the results won't be in until
much later.
   Pryor questioned the two officials as to whether Congress should
approve the $173 million in the defense budget for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1 that is earmarked for the jammer program.
   Duncan said yes; Vander Schaaf said no.
   Earlier, Atwood said Congress should approve the money, arguing
that if the system proves itself in testing, the program will be
worth it.
   Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III told Pryor that the
jammer program is the only system that meets the service's needs
and abandoning the program would force the Navy back to the drawing
board at a considerable expense.
   But the Navy secretary stressed that if the system fails to meet
the service's criteria, he will propose cancellation.
   ``I'm not bashful about recommending that a program be
terminated,'' Garrett said.

   A court-appointed trustee says he will
sell Jim Bakker's former satellite network to Oral Roberts
University for $6 million at the end of the month unless he finds a
buyer for the entire PTL complex.
   ``I do have a firm deal with Oral Roberts University. However,
in the contract, I expressly reserved the right to sell all the
assets until the point of approval of the sale of just the
network,'' the trustee, lawyer Dennis Shedd, said Thursday.
   The 500-acre Heritage USA Christian retreat founded by Bakker in
Fort Mill and 1,700 acres of undeveloped PTL land in South Carolina
have been for sale along with PTL's broadcasting holdings since
April 1988.
   Shedd filed legal papers in Columbia on Thursday asking U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Thurmond Bishop to approve the sale of just the
television production equipment and PTL satellite and cable leases
to the Tulsa, Okla.-based university May 31.
   The Roberts ministry has been plagued by tight finances,
especially since donations to television evangelists plummeted
following the 1987 scandals of Jimmy Swaggart and Bakker.
   In September, Oral Roberts, a 72-year-old faith healer, closed
his City of Faith hospital and medical school and put his home and
other ministry-owned property on the market to repay $25 million in
debts.
   The Tulsa World newspaper quoted Roberts' son Richard as saying
God told his father ``in what my dad believes is his last major
charge from God, to create a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week global
Christian, charismatic healing network.''
   Richard Roberts said regents approved the offer this week, and
the university made a down payment of $1 million raised from
longtime backers.
   Mark Swadener, chief financial officer for the ministries, told
the newspaper he thought the network could provide a vital source
of revenue for the university. He called the plan to purchase the
network ``an act of faith.''
   The ministry also was seeking guaranteed access to the airwaves
at a time when secular networks are displacing evangelists on
Sunday mornings in favor of news shows and cartoons, the newspaper
reported.
   Bakker was convicted last fall of fraudulently raising $158
million from PTL contributors and is serving a 45-year prison
sentence in a federal prison in Minnesota.
   In Charlotte, N.C., the evangelist who introduced Bakker to
church secretary Jessica Hahn pleaded guilty to lying to a federal
grand jury about why he set up the meeting, which eventually led to
Bakker's downfall.
   U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter was expected to sentence
John Wesley Fletcher later this month, Fletcher's lawyer said
Thursday. The perjury count could carry a sentence of eight to 14
months.
   Fletcher denied during a September 1987 appearance before the
grand jury that he brought Miss Hahn to a hotel to have sex with
Bakker. He later testified he had lied.
   The broadcast network purchased by Roberts is operating with a
skeleton staff of about 10 employees. It broadcasts shows produced
by other evangelists such as Jerry Falwell, James Robison and
Richard Roberts.
   At the time PTL declared bankruptcy in June 1987, the satellite
network was carried on 1,300 cable systems that had 12 million
subscribers. According to court papers filed Thursday, that has
slipped to 800 systems with 6.4 million subscribers.
   Even in its weakened condition, the PTL network would be a major
plum for Roberts, said Jerry Rose, president of the National
Religious Broadcasters Association.
   ``You're still talking about a major network that has an awful
lot of potential,'' Rose said.
   Besides PTL, there are four other religious satellite networks
in the United States: Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting
Network, the Southern Baptist Convention's ACTS network, Paul
Crouch's Trinity Network and Jimmy Allen's LIFE TV.
   Other evangelists such as Roberts buy time on those four
networks.

   The biggest maker of aerospace fasteners pleaded
guilty today to conspiracy and agreed to pay $18 million in fines
and costs to settle federal charges that it schemed for 15 years to
falsify test reports on parts.
   VSI Corp. pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and three
counts of mail fraud before U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein.
The pleas were entered by company Vice President Donald S. Parker.
   Two former managers also pleaded guilty to one count each of
conspiracy.
   Rothstein set sentencing for Aug. 17.
   In a statement before a the court hearing, VSI said that as part
of the plea agreement it agreed to pay a $2.5 million fine and pay
the government an estimated $1 million for the costs of the
investigation.
   To resolve a separate civil case, VSI will make an additional
payment of $14.5 million, part of which the government will
distribute among three former VSI employees who initiated the
investigation.
   On Wednesday, the federal government filed its complaint
claiming VSI and the two managers of the test-falsfying scheme,
which featured a phantom ``Inspector 11.''
   VSI, a Fairchild Industries Inc. subsidiary, was accused of
skimping on tests and inspections, sometimes even delivering
substandard parts to boost profits.
   ``We deplore violations of testing requirements that may have
occurred in the past and have taken steps to prevent such conduct
from ever taking place again,'' Ben W. Prescott, president of
Fairchild Fastener Group, said in a statement. ``At the same time
we can assure the public that air safety was not jeopardized at any
time as a result of testing discrepancies.''
   Fairchild Fasteners Group includes the fastener divisions of VSI.
   The complaint is the largest to date in a two-year investigation
of the integrity, testing and inspection of bolts and other parts
used to hold engines, wheels and other key aircraft components in
place, Carter said.
   The probe was triggered by a complaint from whistleblower Tom
Runion shortly after he left his job in the metallurgical
laboratory at VSI's Voi-Shan plant in Chatsworth, Calif., Carter
said.
   James E. Ryan, a former Voi-Shan quality assurance manager, and
Aram Marderian, a former metallurgical laboratory supervisor for
Voi-Shan, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy. Each faces a maximum
sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Inadequate Voi-Shan parts were found during aircraft assembly
and installation and were returned to the manufacturer but
investigators do not know whether there have been any imminent
safety threats, Carter said.
   ``No accidents have been traced to Voi-Shan bolts,'' he said.

   For one policeman persecuted for daring to
organize a policeman's union nine years ago, Friday marked a day of
victory and vindication.
   To cheers and a few tears, a Warsaw court granted legal status
to the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union of Police.
   ``I can really say that the 11th of May is the happiest day of
my life,'' said the policeman, senior Sgt. Jan Jablonski, now
deputy national chairman of the union.
   His fight for the police union was an open wound left over from
the tulmultuous years of 1980-81, when Solidarity was born from
national hope, crushed by martial law.
   For most of the 1980s, Jablonski suffered anonymously, through a
string of unanswered petitions, low-paying jobs and averted looks
from former colleagues who passed him on the street.
   It all began in 1981, when Jablonski and 500 other Interior
Ministry officers banded together and asked to be registered as
``The National Trade Union Committee of Police Functionaries.''
   ``We wanted in our ministry a broader democratization in social
life, among other things to separate political goals from police
functions,'' he once said in a petition to government ombudsman,
Ewa Letowska.
   ``Certainly, like every union, we wanted to defend the rights
and interests of workers. Of course social issues and pay issues
were included in this,'' he said.
   Jablonski, already an 18-year veteran, said Poland's ousted
Communist rulers worked to create distrust between the police and
the rest of society, so it would be easier to use the police
against the people.
   ``In the West the policeman has much more respect of people. ...
I think this was a conscious action of governing teams to
facilitate their wielding of power,'' he said, explaining why
police wanted an independent organization to represent them.
   But all 500 founding union members were persecuted and then
fired before they could set up the organization.
   ``I wanted to change the world and it turned out that finally
the world changed me,'' Jablonski said of the years that followed.
   His first job after being dismissed was obtained through the
Roman Catholic Church. He checked coats in a restaurant, then moved
on to becoming a meter reader for the state power company.
   Friends from years on the police force were under orders, he
says, not to talk with him.
   A proud man, Jablonski kept up a steady battle to get his job
back, through court filings, appeals to the ministry, contacts with
journalists and a petition to Ms. Letowska.
   Solidarity regained its legal status in April 1989 and the
non-Communist government was installed in September. That month
Jablonski put a notice in Solidarity's Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper
asking any police interested in an independent union to contact him.
   Eventually, a nationwide meeting was organized in southern
Poland, where an active-duty captain, Roman Hula, was elected
national chairman of the steering committee and Jablonski was made
his deputy.
   Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak agreed to recognize the union
provisionally in January, and Jablonski and other dismissed
officers were reinstated to their jobs in February.
   Formal court registration was put off until after enactment by
Parliament last month of an Interior Ministry reform law that
abolished the secret service and placed the ministry under civilian
control.
   The law took effect Thursday and the court agreed to register
the union Friday.
   About 70 percent of the 80,000 police have already declared
their intention to join his organization, Jablonski said.

   President Bush brushed off a political
firestorm over possible tax increases on Friday, saying ``I can't
be ruffled'' but refusing to reveal what he will put on the table
at next week's budget summit with Congress.
   ``I'm not going to show you my hand. I haven't seen a lot of
hands being laid down,'' Bush said as he embarked on a two-day trip
of college commencement speeches.
   Democrats have been reluctant to be the first to mention taxes,
urging Bush instead to take the lead in offering a formula to cut
the growing budget defict.
   The administration has warned there would be mandatory spending
cuts of upwards of $100 billion this fall unless Congress and the
White House agree on major reductions in the deficit.
   Bush, talking with reporters on Air Force One, refused to
provide any clues about his strategy but promised to bargain in
good faith with Democrats.
   ``There's no conditions, and that's the way it is,'' Bush said.
``That's the way it's going to be and that's the way it must be.''
   In Washington, Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., said the budget
talks shouldn't just work toward a broad agreement. He suggested
members dealing with the budget should be given official status as
a joint committee that actually shapes a final budget bill for
House and Senate action.
   But Lugar said he is not optimistic the planned talks can
produce an agreement. ``The gaps are so large, and the politics of
it are so difficult,'' Lugar told reporters.
   Bush's invitation to budget negotiations has raised suspicions
among Democrats of an election-year tax trap and sparked fears of
election setbacks for Republicans who have made anti-tax pledges a
key part of their campaigns.
   Bush has not said he would endorse tax increases, but he has
muted his no-new-taxes pledge for the budget talks, which begin
Tuesday.
   The administration is telling Republicans privately that the
``no preconditions'' stance offered by the White House does not
necessarily mean Bush will accept increased taxes.
   The atmosphere for the talks was clouded when White House chief
of staff John Sununu suggested this week that the president would
not accept a tax increase regardless of what the Democrats propose.
   Bush, asked if Sununu's remarks reflected his position, said,
``I would ask you to reflect my posture, to talk about what I say
... So I'd respectfully suggest you take your guidance from me on
this one, because that's the way it is.''
   And Bush said Sununu was not in trouble for his remarks.
``That's silly, so stupid. None of these congressmen are in
trouble, either,'' he said.
   ``I'm approaching it very openly, and I recognize the
controversy swirling around from one statement or another,'' he
said. ``But look, stay on track, steady as she goes, and be open,
deal frankly with people and deal in the way I've said.''
   Bush said that, ``Tomorrow there'll be another tidal wave so
keep your snorkel above the water level and do what you think is
best.
   ``(It) goes back to what my mom taught me when I was about six:
`Do your best, do your best.' Well, I'm trying hard. Stay calm.''
   Bush said, ``I think the president has a certain responsibility
to stay cool, make clear to people that he's dealing in good faith
and do my best.
   ``That's exactly what I intend to do, and I can't be ruffled by
these things,'' Bush said. ``I've got to be understanding when
people come forward and express themselves forcefully on something
like this.''

<HEAD>Retiree Groups Say SSA Services Have Declined</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 9th graf pvs, Enoff said, to CORRECT that figure was not

   Six straight years of budget cuts have sharply
reduced the ability of the Social Security Administration to serve
older Americans, retiree organizations told Congress on Friday.
   A 21-percent slash in the Social Security payroll has been
accompanied by ``a marked decline in service and renewed complaints
about inaccurate information, constantly busy telephones (and)
arbitrary rulings on eligibility,'' said Lawrence Smedley,
executive director of the National Council of Senior Citizens.
   ``In some offices, clerical positions have been reduced to the
point that managers are often covering reception desks and spending
time on data entry,'' Margaret Dixon, a director of the American
Association of Retired Persons, told a hearing by the Senate
Finance Social Security subcommittee.
   Louis D. Enoff, deputy commissioner of Social Security,
acknowledged the agency is being stretched to near its limit.
   Nevertheless, Enoff said, ``satisfaction with SSA service has
also remained high, with over 83 percent of respondents in a
national survey last year rating SSA's service as either good or
very good.''
   One reason, Enoff said, is that the agency has been able to
retain technical employees and those who work directly with
retirees and the disabled.
   The testimony was presented at a hearing on a bill by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcomittee.
   The legislation, whose chief goal is removing the agency from
the Department of Health and Human Services, would boost Social
Security staff by 7,000, to 70,000 full-time workers.
   Enoff said agency officials were confident an increase of that
size was not needed, although a former deputy used that figure in a
memo to an associate earlier this year.
   Enoff said approval of President Bush's budget would assure that
Social Security staff would be held at 63,000 ``and give SSA the
period of stability it so sorely needs.''
   John F. Delfico, a director of the General Accounting Office, an
arm of Congress, said that although there may be a need for more
workers in some areas, ``a thorough study needs to be undertaken
before wholesale increases in staffing are made.''
   Another part of Moynihan's bill would require Social Security to
list local office numbers in telephone directories. The agency now
lists only a toll-free nationwide number, but on request will give
a local number to anyone who calls the toll-free line.
   ``Because the mental, physical and educational handicaps of some
older and disabled Americans makes the telephone an uncomfortable
and unfamiliar instrument, local offices must remain accessible and
adequately staffed,'' said Mrs. Dixon of AARP.

<HEAD>Newspaper: South African Spy Group Contaminated Refugees' Drinking
Water</HEAD>

   A South African spy
organization poisoned drinking water at a refugee camp to disrupt
elections in Namibia as part of sabotage operations in Africa and
Europe, a newspaper reported Friday.
   However, a Namibian health official said refugee camp water and
sewage was extensively tested last year and that no traces of
cholera were found.
   ``It sounds like absolute nonsense,'' Rodion Kraus, director of
community health services in Namibia, said of the reported claim
that cholera germs had been put into drinking water.
   Vrye Weekblad, a weekly Afrikaans language newspaper, quoted a
former official of the Civilian Cooperation Bureau as saying in an
interview that the unit had cells in black African nations and
Europe and planned killings of anti-apartheid activists.
   The South African government is conducting an investigation into
the bureau and into allegations that police and military operatives
killed anti-apartheid activists. Several former police officers
have claimed they were involved in killing activists. President
F.W. de Klerk told the commission not to investigate activities
outside South Africa.
   Vrye Weekblad, which helped uncover the first public details
about the CCB, said it obtained further information in an interview
with former CCB official Petrus Jacobus Botes, who said he headed
the unit's activities in Mozambique and Swaziland.
   Botes said CCB activities ranged from murder and sabotage to
bombings, bribery and blackmail, the newspaper reported. The paper
said Botes claimed his agents were responsible for a 1988 bomb
blast in Mozambique that blew off the arm of African National
Congress legal expert Albie Sachs.
   Botes also claimed his unit was instructed to kill South African
Communist Party chief Joe Slovo, then in exile in Zambia, the
article said. It did not say if any attempt was made on Slovo's
life.
   The newspaper said Botes claimed that CCB operatives put cholera
germs in drinking water at the Dobra refugee camp in Namibia in
1989 as part of efforts to disrupt the South West African Peoples'
Organization's election campaign. The story did not say how this
was intended to disrupt the election.
   SWAPO, which waged a guerrilla campaign against South African
rule of Namibia, won the elections. Namibia became independent in
March.
   Kraus said there was no cholera at Dobra refugee camp. He said
since many of the 40,000 Namibians who returned from exile to vote
had come from cholera-infected areas, stringent checks were made of
the water and sewage.
   Police and Defense Force spokesmen in Pretoria had no immediate
response Friday to the newspaper report.
   Cabinet members and other top government officials denied any
knowledge of the CCB until late last year.
   The group allegedly used civilians or police officers to kill
government opponents and disrupt anti-government activities.

   Clutching a new stuffed animal, a
5-year-old girl boarded a private jet with her parents for home
Friday, 39 days after her abduction by a man authorities described
as an obsessed baby sitter.
   Kenneth Cole, accused of abducting Nicole Ravesi on April 3,
awaited transfer to Massachusetts to face charges.
   The girl was reunited late Thursday with her parents, Frank and
Debra Ravesi of Milford, Mass. Nicole was found earlier in the day
with Cole in a trailer in a small Gulf Coast fishing village about
70 miles southwest of Tallahassee.
   The Ravesis had at one time taken out a restraining order
against Cole after social workers alerted them that the sometime
baby sitter's attachment toward Nicole appeared obsessive. However,
the family allowed Cole to see the girl at least twice after the
order expired.
   After leaving a hotel Friday, the Ravesis stopped at a shopping
mall, where a store owner gave Nicole a blue-and-white striped
dress, pink shoes and the stuffed dog.
   The girl was examined by a private pedetrician before the family
departed.
   Mrs. Ravesi said later the girl was in good shape and had not
been hurt during the ordeal.
   When asked how she felt while leaving the hotel, Nicole said,
``good.'' She didn't respond to other questions.
   ``We're thankful to get our daughter back,'' said Ravesi, who
described his daughter as ``kind of scared of the cameras.''
   Mrs. Ravesi said she was ``very happy, very happy.'' She said
they hadn't talked with Nicole about her experiences during her
ordeal.
   Cole, 24, remained at the medium-security Federal Correctional
Institution in Tallahassee while the U.S. Marshal's Service worked
out details on returning him to Massachusetts, FCI spokesman Dan
Rouse said.
   The youngster was reported missing after she was taken from a
car where she and a sister waited for her mother to finish her work
as a bus driver.
   Cole had been a former co-worker of Mrs. Ravesi's. He lost his
job as a bus driver and began baby-sitting occasionally for the
family.
   When Nicole was hospitalized last year for a hip infection, Cole
visited her frequently. The hospital staff reported him to the
Department of Social Services because they saw him kissing her on
the lips and showing affection they thought excessive.
   Social workers investigated and told the family in February that
Cole's attachment to Nicole seemed to be obsessive. The Ravesis
obtained a restraining order against Cole to prevent him from
seeing or speaking to Nicole.
   However, the couple say they allowed Cole to see the child in
two parking lot rendezvous after the five-day restraining order
expired, because they thought he was harmless.
   Cole was arrested Thursday by the FBI and Franklin County
Sheriff Warren Roddenberry. Authorities were tipped late Wednesday
on the whereabouts of the fugitive after television stations in
Panama City, Fla., broadcast material on the two, said James
Cagnassola Jr., FBI agent in charge for north Florida.
   The case was featured on the ``America's Most Wanted'' Fox
Network program April 8, April 15 and April 29, Cagnassola said.
Fox paid for the family's transportation home.
   The girl and her accused abductor apparently had been living in
a travel trailer since late last month after spending some time at
the Pine Ridge Lodge in Panama City Beach.
   The two apparently left Panama City Beach on April 28 and
traveled 85 miles to East Point by bicycle, Cagnassola said.
   Cagnassola said the two may have reached Florida by train.
Cole's car was found in an Amtrak parking lot in Providence, R.I.,
where it had been parked since shortly after the girl disappeared.

<HEAD>Gang Fight Breaks Out During Crowded Night-Court Session</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gang fight at a crowded night-court session
left a blood-spattered courtroom and shaken court employees
demanding better security, but there were no arrests because nobody
wanted to get involved, police said.
   The ruckus late Wednesday involved several young men and was
witnessed by about two dozen lawyers, court employees, defendants
and others on the seventh floor of the Public Safety Building,
which also houses police headquarters.
   There was no security officer or judge present when a young man
entered Seattle Municipal Court No. 1 and got into a fight with two
others who were already there, apparently waiting for hearing
dates, police said.
   Several other young men in white clothing and hats then entered
the room and joined in the brawl, punching the man whose arrival
apparently sparked the fracas, throwing him to the floor and
kicking him in the head, witnesses said.
   By the time police arrived, the victim and most of the youths
had left. Blood was spattered near the judge's bench, the
prosecutor's table, the courthouse hallway and an elevator.
   Police spokesman Mark Amundson said officers found several
witnesses but ``none of them wanted to get involved.'' The victim,
found later on the street, refused medical attention and wouldn't
press charges, Amundson said.
   ``Two suspects were still there when the officers arrived, and
the officers could have arrested them but only if a victim made a
complaint or the witnesses said something,'' Amundson said. ``None
of them would.''
   While a police officer questioned a defense lawyer, a black-clad
youth waiting in line for a court date warned her not to get
involved, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported.
   ``You should just keep it quiet, just keep your mouth shut,'' he
told her.
   ``I don't believe our courtrooms should be armed camps, but we
need security,'' Municipal Judge Barbara Yanick said. ``I guess
it's a sign of the times.''
   Municipal Court Administrator Esther Bauman said she'll shift
$18,000 of the budget to hire a police officer for night screenings
after June. Police Chief Patrick Fitzsimons will post an officer at
the court until then, she said.
   Ms. Bauman said court workers has been concerned about an
increased gang presence since last year, when officials began
scheduling initial court appearances for defendants four nights a
week to streamline the process.
   Ms. Bauman said the night hearings, in which 400 defendants a
week are assigned a public defender and a court date were ``very
cost effective'' but differed from a formal courtroom because there
was no judge and defendants were required to stand in three
separate lines, causing tempers to flare.

   Two toy manufacturers are recalling more than
69,000 toys because they contain parts that present choking hazards
to small children, a government agency said Friday.
   The first toymaker, Goldwell International, Inc., is recalling
13,583 Public Telephone toys that were sold nationally since March
1989, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   The toys which resemble push-button, coin-operated telephones
and come with plastic coins in various sizes and colors and were
sold for children under age three.
   However, the coins and the buttons which can become detached
from the phones may be swallowed and could choke small children.
   In the second instance, Minneapolis-based Target Stores has
recalled 27,000 My First Buddy Wrecker trucks, 27,000 My First
Buddy Pumper fire trucks and 1,497 Potpourri Baby Dolls. All items
were sold nationwide in 1988 and 1989.
   The emergency light on the wrecker trucks, the nozzle on the
pumper trucks and the arms and legs of the dolls all present
small-parts choking hazards, said the CPSC.
   The companies and the commission are not aware of any injuries
involving the toys, but consumers are urged to return them to the
stores where purchased for a refund.

<HEAD>Nelson and Winnie Mandela Receive Emotional Welcome at Angola ANC
Camp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIANA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson and Winnie Mandela received an
emotional welcome from South African political exiles Friday at an
ANC training camp, where they spoke of their hopes and fears for
South Africa.
   The Mandelas urged rank-and-file discipline when the African
National Congress' estimated 15,000 exiles around the world
eventually return home.
   ``We feel the day we have been waiting for might be close at
hand,'' said Nelson Mandela, standing in a hut at Viana. Viana is
12 miles outside the Angolan capital of Luanda.
   ``The ANC calls on you to act in a disciplined manner when you
return, and I must say (members) can't expect to be able to live
like millionaires _ choosing mansions in whatever part of town they
prefer,'' he said.
   Mandela was greeted by chants of ``we know you are our father,''
in the Zulu and Sotho languages. He gave the crowd of about 200 a
detailed account of his talks last week with South African
President F.W. de Klerk. The two agreed to work for an end to
political violence and clear the way for bringing blacks into the
government.
   The ANC deputy president was obviously moved by the warm
reception. He read the agreement reached with de Klerk in full to
the crowd and later answered members' questions in a session closed
to the handful of foreign journalists covering the visit.
   Mandela said he believed de Klerk and the government delegation
at the talks were sincerely searching for a peaceful solution but
warned, ``We don't know if the delegation stands for all whites in
South Africa, and that's what we're worried about.''
   He repeated ANC demands that all exiles should be allowed to
return home under a general amnesty; that all political prisoners _
including those facing death sentences _ be released; and that the
state of emergency dating from 1986 be lifted before any truce in
the fight against white-minority rule.
   Winnie Mandela paid tribute to the militants working abroad for
as long as 30 years, saying, ``you have made us walk tall, made us
feel we could challenge Pretoria with the knowledge you could hit
where we inside (South Africa) couldn't.''
   De Klerk legalized the ANC in February after a 30-year ban. The
same month, he ordered the release of Mandela, who had been in jail
27 years and was serving a life sentence for plotting against the
government.
   Both Mandelas urged ANC members to accept land offered by South
African local authorities for housing projects, citing job and
housing shortages.
   Both were frequently interrupted by cheering and singing as they
joked with the crowd through much of the speeches.
   Mandela ridiculed former South African governments for
accusations that the ANC envisions a ``Soviet-style Marxist
state,'' and reiterated that the ANC wants a democratic South
Africa.
   ``When we fight against apartheid, we're not fighting against
the whites, we're fighting against a policy,'' he said.
   The Mandelas arrived Thursday from Lusaka, Zambia, for their
first visit to Angola. Angola was the ANC's most prominent foreign
supporter in the mid-1970s, allowing guerrillas from the movement's
military wing to train in at least seven major military camps.
   Luanda's pledged to end military aid to the ANC in Dec. 1988 as
part of regional peace accords signed by Angola, Cuba and South
Africa. The 2,500 ANC members currently in Angola are political
exiles living in civilian training camps near the capital.

   Authorities on Friday investigated
allegations of illegal activities in a legislative office building
where a woman said she was interviewed for an ``escort service.''
   Robert Stewart, chief of the State Law Enforcement Division,
would say only that an investigation was under way at the request
by House Speaker Robert Sheheen.
   The basis for the allegations, according to media reports, is a
classified advertisement that appeared in The State newspaper
asking for ``host-hostesses for private parties.'' It offered up to
$1,000 a week for full- or part-time work.
   A woman who had her identity cloaked told WIS-TV for a broadcast
Thursday that she answered the ad and went to an office in the
Blatt Building shared by Reps. Joe E. Brown of Columbia and Ennis
Fant of Greenville. Both are Democrats, as is the House speaker.
   Brown adamantly denied Thursday ever talking to a woman about
any such activity. He said he welcomed the investigation to prove
his innocence. On Friday he suggested the woman may have been
confused about which suite she went to in the building, where all
124 state representatives have offices.
   Fant also denied any involvement. ``I'm a Baptist preacher, and
I sure wouldn't be involved in any such thing,'' he said. ``I
sometimes sell a little insurance out of my office here, but that
other stuff, absolutely no way.''
   Stewart refused to say whether specific lawmakers were under
investigation.
   The ad gave respondents a telephone number to call Monday
through Friday between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. The number is for a
telephone in Columbia but not at the Blatt Building, Stewart said.
A recording said the number was disconnected Friday.

<HEAD>Berkeley Unveils Program to Teach About Minorities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of California at
Berkeley, recently disrupted by student protests demanding more
minority teachers, has launched a new cultural studies program.
   Beginning with the freshman class of 1991, all undergraduates
will be required to take one course on minority culture. Each of
the courses will focus on three minority ethnic groups, said Ron
Choy, assistant director of the new program.
   ``We're creating a whole new program from scratch,'' said Choy,
assistant director of the new Center for the Teaching and Study of
American Cultures. The center, planned for some time, opened
Thursday.
   Choy said he expects students to welcome the courses, noting the
ethnically diverse student body has a strong interest in race and
minority reations.
   Some students boycotted classes for two days last month to
protest the lack of ethnic diversity among the faculty. Out of
1,636 full professors, only 24 percent are women or members of
minority groups.
   ``Frankly, this center was created partly to help get the
faculty up to date,'' Choy said. ``We have to teach them, too.''
   The 1989-90 student body is 45 percent white, 27 percent Asian,
13 percent Hispanic, 8 percent black, 1 percent American Indian and
6 percent undeclared, according to the school.
   The cultural studies center was created as part of a
restructuring of Berkeley's 1960s-era ethnic studies programs, Choy
said.
   ``Most ethnics studies classes just talk about one group,'' he
said. ``We want to create new classes that will deal with at least
three minority groups at one time in an integrated, comparative
way.''
   Such an overlapping picture of ethnic groups will better mirror
society, he said.

<TEXT>
   The number of workers employed by farmers rose
seasonally in April and was up slightly from a year earlier, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   A quarterly report said the hired work force on farms was
estimated at 833,000 during the week of April 8-14, up from 695,000
in January. A year ago in April, the work force was 830,000.
   Those did not include 203,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. In April, those
totaled 143,000 workers; in April 1989, they were estimated at
198,000.
   ``Widespread rains during the week of April 8-14, 1990 slowed
field work in the Corn Belt, Delta and Southeast,'' the report said.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was
reported at $5.54 per hour, down from $5.70 in January but up from
$5.35 in April 1989.
   For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage
rate available. However, workers in California were reported at
$6.59 per hour, compared with $6.20 in January and $6.45 a year
ago. Florida workers averaged $5.93 per hour, compared with $6.23
in January and $6.24 a year earlier.

<HEAD>Sponsor Says Missing Chinese Farmers Are Welcome to Return</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seven Chinese farmers who mysteriously
disappeared on arrival in this country may have been on an extended
sightseeing trip, their would-be host said Friday.
   ``This is kind of a sad story in a way that the mistake of one
group can do so much harm,'' said sponsor Molly Aitken, who
reported receiving a letter this week from the farmers.
   The letter said the farmers merely slipped away to see more of
New York City and were embarrassed by the national kidnapping
investigation their departure touched off.
   ``I think everyone wants to forgive them, but they're going to
have to come back and work hard now to make up for what they've
done,'' Mrs. Aitken said in a telephone interview from her farm in
Athol.
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, whose police
continue to investigate the case as a reported abduction, is
checking out the letter. ``It's just loony enough to possibly be
true, but we're not ruling anything out at this point,'' said
spokesman Allen Morrison.
   The letter, postmarked in New York City and received Wednesday
in Athol said the men were embarrassed, felt they had ``lost
face,'' and were afraid to return in case they risk deportation,
Mrs. Aitken said.
   The seven Chinese arrived April 25 at New York's Kennedy
International Airport with nine other peasants. They came to
participate in a project to build a model Third World village
during an 11-month stay at Mrs. Aitken's estate on the outskirts of
Athol, a small town about 50 miles north of Springfield.
   Mrs. Aitken, president of the World Energy Foundation organizing
the project, met the farmers at the airport and told police she was
afraid they had been kidnapped when she saw some of them being
hustled into a car.
   The letter, signed by three of the missing farmers on behalf of
all seven, explained that they were met by friends at the airport
and decided to slip away to tour New York's Chinatown, Mrs. Aitken
said.
   ``According to the letter, they didn't realize they had caused
so much trouble,'' she said. The letter also said the peasants did
not see Mrs. Aitken at the airport and planned to contact her after
a few days in New York.
   Mrs. Aitken said she has spoken with officials at the New York
Chinese Consulate and with officials in Fujian Province, home
region for the farmers.
   ``I don't know the position that the Chinese government will
take, but I imagine that it will also be one of understanding,''
she said. ``I certainly hope that it will be.''
   Officials with the Chinese consulate in New York did not return
a telephone call Friday from The Associated Press.
   Charles Troy, spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service in New York, said the agency would like to interview the
farmers if they are found, and would not say what they plan to do
after that.
   Morrison said the Port Authority doesn't think the farmers broke
any laws. Investigators were skeptical of the kidnap story because
the three alleged abductors grabbed the seven without weapons and
got them into a car.
   Morrison said the authority has a copy of the letter, which they
will investigate to make sure it is not a hoax and was not written
under duress.
   ``We will not consider the case closed until we see them and
interview them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Police: Child Unharmed as Murder-Suicide Ends Custody Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 18-month-old child was found unharmed in
the arms of her dead mother after a custody battle ended in a
murder-suicide, police said.
   The baby's father, Charles C. Tolliver, 47, shot his estranged
girlfriend in her Tampa apartment Wednesday, then flew to Columbia,
S.C., and killed himself Thursday, said Hillsborough Sheriff's
spokeswoman Debbie Carter.
   A manager at the apartment complex found Gloria Goines, 39, dead
in the living room, nearly 18 hours after the shooting, police
said. Her daughter, Jimisha Carol Tolliver was lying in her
mother's bloody arms.
   Sheriff's investigators said Tolliver and Ms. Goins had been
fighting over custody of the baby.
   About the same time, police at Fort Jackson, an Army training
base outside Columbia, called Tolliver's apartment manager in Tampa
about a suicide at the base. Investigators went to the apartment
and found a suicide note, but refused to describe its contents.
   Tolliver was found in a rented car with a .38-caliber gunshot
wound to the side of his head, according to coroner Frank Barron.
Authorities said they didn't know why Tolliver, a member of the Air
Force Reserve, went to the base, which is near his family's home.
   The toddler was taken into custody by the Department of Health
and Rehabilitative Services.

<HEAD>South African Spy Unit Operated Throughout Africa, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported that a
South African spy organization put cholera germs in drinking water
at a refugee camp in Namibia. But a health official said tests
turned up no such traces.
   Vrye Weekblad, a weekly Afrikaans-language newspaper, quoted a
former official of the Civilian Cooperation Bureau, or CCB, as
saying in an interview that the contamination of the camp's water
was part of a sabotage operation aimed at disrupting the Namibian
elections.
   It quoted the official as saying the unit had cells in black
African nations and Europe and had planned killings of
anti-apartheid activists.
   The South African government is conducting an investigation into
the CCB and allegations that police and military operatives killed
activists. Several former police officers have claimed they were
involved in killing activists.
   But President F.W. de Klerk told the commission not to
investigate activities outside South Africa.
   Police and Defense Force spokesmen in Pretoria had no immediate
response Friday to the report. Cabinet members and other top
government officials have denied any knowledge of the CCB until
late last year.
   On the cholera allegation, a Namibian health official said
refugee camp water and sewage was extensively tested for cholera
last year, and no traces were found.
   Vrye Weekblad, which helped uncover the first public details
about the CCB, said it obtained further information from former CCB
official Petrus Jacobus Botes, who said he headed the unit's
activities in Mozambique and Swaziland.
   The CCB ran destabilization operations in black African nations,
with units or cells based in Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zaire and other
nations, the article said. Botes said CCB activities ranged from
murder and sabotage to bombings, bribery and blackmail, the
newspaper reported. The paper said Botes claimed his agents were
responsible for a 1988 bomb blast in Mozambique that blew off the
arm of African National Congress legal expert Albie Sachs.
   Botes also claimed his unit was instructed to kill South African
Communist Party chief Joe Slovo, then in exile in Zambia, the
article said. It did not say if any attempt was made on Slovo's
life.
   The newspaper said Botes claimed CCB operatives put cholera
germs in drinking water at the Dobra refugee camp in Namibia in
1989 as part of efforts intended to disrupt the election campaign
of the South West African Peoples' Organization, or SWAPO.
   Rodion Kraus, director of community health services in Namibia,
said there was no cholera at Dobra refugee camp. He said since many
of the 40,000 Namibians who returned from exile to vote had come
from cholera-infected areas, stringent checks were made of the
water and sewage.
   ``It sounds like absolute nonsense,'' he said of the reported
claim.
   Botes was quoted as saying the CCB was in chaos last year, and
the outcome of its plans in Namibia was ``the mistaken murder'' of
Anton Lubowski, the only white SWAPO executive member. Lubowski was
assassinated outside his home in September.
   SWAPO, which waged a guerrilla campaign against South African
rule of the territory, won the U.N.-supervised elections. Namibia
became independent in March.
   Although South African police have said they believe CCB members
were involved in Lubowski's murder, de Klerk specifically forbade
the commission from including that case in its investigation.
   The article also said Botes informed South African Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok in August 1989 of CCB activities after he was
involved in a dispute with the group's leaders about expenses.
   Botes, according to the newspaper, also claimed the CCB planned
to kill SWAPO activist Hidipo Hamutenya, who is now minister of
information in the Namibian government.
   It did not say if any attempt was made, but Hamutenya said,
``I'd been warned during those days that there was a plan to kill
me.''

   President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa
expressed optimism Friday that his country's isolation will soon
end as he came to Greece on a European trip aimed at winning
support for his reforms.
   De Klerk held separate talks with President Constantine
Caramanlis and Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis during a
one-day visit to this European Community member.
   On Friday night, police battled about 200 anarchists outside
Parliament who were protesting De Klerk's visit. The police fired
tear gas and charged the demonstrators, who were at the end of a
protest march by thousands of students, after the anarchists hurled
firebombs.
   Four protesters were arrested, a police spokesman said. One
policeman was slightly injured after he struck on the head by a
stone, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   At a joint news conference with Mitsotakis, de Klerk said he was
pleased with the outcome so far of his 18-day European tour, which
began Thursday with a meeting in Paris with French President
Francois Mitterrand.
   ``There has been a surge of new interest in what is happening in
South Africa,'' de Klerk said. ``We have found that in actual fact
there is a reevaluation taking place in the total international
community with regard to the situation in South Africa.''
   Mitsotakis said he was impressed by de Klerk's viewpoint on the
situation in South Africa, which ``aims at the total abolition of
apartheid.''
   Western leaders agreed to begin easing South Africa's isolation
after de Klerk in February ordered the release of jailed black
leader Nelson Mandela and legalized the African National Congress
and other anti-apartheid groups.
   It is the most extensive foreign mission by a South African head
of state since the ruling white-minority National Party took power
in 1948.
   On his trip, de Klerk is seeking to win support for his reform
initiatives and the lifting of European Community economic
sanctions. Mandela has opposed lifting the sanctions.
   Mitterrand said the issue of sanctions would be taken up at the
EC summit scheduled for June 25-26 in Dublin, Ireland.
   At his Athens news conference, de Klerk said Denmark had decided
to send an ambassador to South Africa, signaling the changing
attitude in the West toward South Africa.
   ``We actually find that some foreign governments are acting on
their own accord,'' he said. ``One good example is the
establishment of full diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level
with Denmark.''
   Denmark has maintained its diplomatic representation in South
Africa at the consular level.
   Friday was a holiday in Denmark, and there was no government
comment on de Klerk's remarks. However, a low-level duty officer at
the Foreign Ministry in Copenhagen said there had been no
announcement there of a change in relations with South Africa.
   Denmark and the Netherlands have been the staunchest opponents
in the EC of easing sanctions against South Africa.
   Relations between Greece and South Africa have been
traditionally close, due mainly to the 100,000-strong Greek
community in South Africa. The Greek royal family took temporary
refuge in South Africa during the Nazi occupation.
   Greece has abided by EC sanctions that ban certain South African
imports and new investments in South Africa.
   De Klerk was scheduled to remain in Greece over the weekend on
an unofficial stay, before leaving for Portugal on Monday. He also
plans stops in Belgium, Britain, West Germany, Switzerland, Spain
and Italy.
   The Greek government has said it expects Mandela, deputy
president of the African National Congress, to visit Athens when he
starts his own European tour next month.
   Mandela and de Klerk agreed during talks last week to work
together to end political violence and clear the way for formal
negotiations on a new constitution that would extend voting rights
to South Africa's black majority.

<HEAD>Elizabeth Taylor Suffers Complications, Six More Weeks in Hospital</HEAD>

   Elizabeth Taylor suffered
complications including new infections in her fifth week of
hospitalization for pneumonia, and will remain hospitalized for
about six more weeks, doctors said Friday.
   The recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with viral
pneumonia, was dealt a setback by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast
infection, her doctors said.
   During the next 1{ months, she will require intravenous therapy
in the hospital, they said in a statement released by St. John's
Hospital and Health Center.
   Bacterial pneumonia is generally considered less serious than
the viral pneumonia Miss Taylor initially contracted. That's
because antibiotics are effective against bacteria but not viruses.
   ``She is tolerating this therapy extremely well and her doctors
are pleased with her progress,'' Miss Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam,
said after talking to doctors.
   Hospital spokeswoman Paulette Weir said she couldn't go beyond
the statement. Miss Taylor was still in a private room and not the
intensive care unit, she said.
   Earlier this week, Ms. Sam said the 58-year-old actress was
improving and would be released from the hospital this week to
recuperate at home.
   During a news conference last month, Miss Taylor's doctors
revealed she was near death on April 22.
   The Oscar-winning star of ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''
and ``Butterfield 8'' entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on
April 9 with a sinus infection, but her condition deteriorated and
she was moved to St. John's for treatment of viral pneumonia.
   Miss Taylor was reportedly in one of the hospital's suites.
   Suites are ``like a small hotel room with a sitting room, a
living room area,'' Weir said without confirming whether the
actress was in a suite.
   Visitors throughout Miss Taylor's hospitalization included her
four children, Maria Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopher
and Michael Wilding. Entertainer Michael Jackson also paid a visit.

<TEXT>
   FBI Director William S. Sessions said Friday
that just 40 percent of an estimated 550 major drug trafficking
organizations are under active investigation by the bureau.
   If the bureau were to pursue every drug ring it has identified,
Sessions said, ``We could use, not the 1,200 agents that are
currently assigned to drug investigations. We could use 9,500, and
you know it and we all know it.''
   Sessions, in a meeting with reporters at his office, said the
same problem applies to the FBI's pursuit of fraud cases at banks
and savings and loan institutions. He said about 550 institutions
actually are under investigation, while the bureau has had more
than 20,000 ``referrals'' _ complaints _ from various other
governmental agencies. The bureau has about 600 agents assigned to
such cases.
   Still, Sessions pronounced himself satisfied with the bureau's
pace in both the drug and financial arenas. ``I think the FBI's
national drug strategy is right on target,'' he said.
   On other topics, Sessions said:
   _He is not discouraged that the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in
December of 1988 remains an open case, with no one yet charged. All
259 people aboard the Boing 747 were killed, as were seven people
on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland. ``I was confident then and I
am confident now that we will successfully complete our
investigation,'' he said.
   _Leads ``are consistently moving and progressing very well'' in
the investigation of four mail bombings in the South, including
those which killed a federal appeals judge, Robert S. Vance, in
Birmingham, Ala., and a civil rights lawyer, Robert F. Robinson, in
Savannah, Ga. Asked if the investigation were at the ``tie-up''
stage, Sessions said. ``We're not there yet. But we're approaching
it.''
   _It is too early for the FBI to declare a ``peace dividend'' by
allocating counter-espionage resources elsewhere. ``Even though
there is a tremendous move towards freedom and democracy in the
(Eastern) bloc countries, we do not know about how that will
actually change the operation of the approach of the various
intellgence services,'' Sessions said. ``We do have things other
than military secrets ... there is a perception that these
countries will need to succeed economically, and that they will,
therefore, be looking not just for military information but for
technological and scientific information that is not properly
theirs.'' Asked if he were aware of Soviet or Eastern European
agents attempting to enlist Americans in recent months, Session
replied ``Yes. The patterns and activities of the past do
continue.'' He would not elaborate.
   Sessions repeatedly declined comment on the FBI's role in the
investigation of Washington Mayor Marion Barry, who faces 14
drug-related charges. But the FBI director did acknowledge he had
seen an FBI videotape which purportedly shows the mayor smoking
crack cocaine after being invited to do so by a female informant.

   Stock prices rocketed to near record-heights on
Friday as favorable inflation news and falling interest rates drew
investors to Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip industrial stocks finished
up 63.07 at 2,801.58, short of the record high close of 2,810.15
reached on Jan. 2. It was the biggest one-day advance for the Dow
average this year.
   Broader market indicators also rose sharply, with advancing
issues swamping decliners on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The government reported that the producer price index of
finished goods dropped 0.3 percent in April, in contrast to Wall
Street's expectations of a 0.1 percent-0.3 percent increase.
Another government report said retail sales, another widely watched
statistic, fell 0.6 percent last month.
   Analysts said the figures provided the markets with a double
dose of evidence that the pace of the economy remained slow and
inflationary pressures were subdued, making stocks and bonds a much
more attractive investment.

   A group of high-rolling baccarat
players who bet $200,000 a hand at one of Donald Trump's casinos
lost about $10 million after their weeklong binge.
   Trump said Friday that Japanese businessman Akio Kashiwagi had
been up by nearly $10 million earlier in the week before the cards
turned against him and for the Trump Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino.
   ``He was up $9.6 million and then we had a good run,'' Trump
said in a telephone interview.
   Kashiwagi attracted a gathering of amazed small-time players
whenever he came down from his 37th-floor suite to play $100,000 a
hand while two companions placed $50,000 bets. Trump said Kashiwagi
tried to come back and play Thursday after surrendering early that
morning $10 million in the hole.
   ``We said, `forget it, that's enough,'' Trump said. ``Frankly,
you have to be in the mood.''
   Kashiwagi sat at the baccarat table Thursday with $1 million in
chips while his companions had $500,000 apiece. He got up before
any of the cards were dealt and did not return.
   Trump said he did not know if Kashiwagi would return to play
again.
   Kashiwagi could not be reached for comment. A casino operator
said there was no room listed for anyone named Kashiwagi.
   In February, Kashiwagi won $6.2 million from Trump Plaza at
baccarat, a high-stakes card game where players seek to bet on the
hand that comes closest to totaling nine. Face cards are worth zero.
   Trump acknowledged allowing Kashiwagi to play is a gamble but
said that's part of the casino business.
   ``It's risky, but I like it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A former death-row inmate convicted in the
mutilation slayings of his stepdaughter and her fiancee in 1982 was
set free Friday after prosecutors decided not to try him a second
time.
   Dale Johnston, 56, who has maintained he is innocent, emerged
from the Licking County jail promising to search for the real
killer.
   ``It's a beautiful day,'' Johnston told reporters he met in his
lawyer's office in Columbus.
   He was freed secretly after the sheriff's department received a
death threat against him, said Sheriff Gerry Billy.
   Three judges found Johnston guilty in 1984 of aggravated murder
in the slayings of his stepdaughter, Annette Cooper Johnston, 18,
and her fiance, Todd Schultz, 19, both of Logan in southeast Ohio.
He was sentenced to death in the electric chair.
   Ms. Johnston and Schultz were last seen Oct. 4, 1982, in Logan.
Their torsos were discovered 10 days later in the Hocking River.
Other body parts were unearthed in a cornfield.
   Prosecutors alleged that Johnston killed the two on his Hocking
County farm with a .22-caliber handgun, then dismembered their
bodies. Prosecutors said jealousy was the motive for the killings
and that Johnston had a sexual relationship with his stepdaughter.
   Johnston spoke of long years in prison and his resolution to
search for a murderer.
   ``For the last 7{ years, I've taken everything one day at a
time. I'll continue with that for a while,'' he said. ``A soon as
possible, we'll start pursuing the one goal I have left, and that's
to find the person who killed my daughter.''
   Johnston had been held in the county jail in this central Ohio
city, about 30 miles east of Columbus, awaiting a second trial.
Johnston served more than seven years in prison for slayings.
   Johnston's ex-wife, Sarah, the mother of the slain woman, was
waiting for Johnston at the jail. She expressed happiness with
Johnston's release.
   ``It's going to be a beautiful day. It's just fantastic to know
that his attorneys have finally prevailed, that justice finally
came through on our side this time,'' she said.
   The Johnstons are divorced. She remarried and is living in
southern Ohio outside Hocking County.
   Johnston's release was cleared after a prosecutor on Thursday
dropped charges following an appeals court's ruling that certain
evidence could not be used against Johnston. The prosecutor
contended the evidence was crucial to obtaining a second conviction.
   Johnston's first conviction was thrown out by the Ohio Supreme
Court in 1988, which ruled that a witness whose memory had been
refreshed by hypnosis had been improperly allowed to testify.
   A second trial was put on hold last July after Judge William
Gillie ruled that Johnston's rights were violated when police
questioned him for 8{ hours without a lawyer present.
   Gillie also ruled that boots, a vest and other clothing taken
from Johnston during the interrogation could not be used as
evidence. The judge said a police officer tried to deceive Johnston
into thinking that he had blood on his boots.
   Prosecutors tried to link the boots to footprints near where the
bodies were found.
   The 10th Ohio District Court of Appeals on Thursday upheld
Gillie's decision. Logan County Prosecuter Charles Gerken then
decided to drop the charges.
   Schultz's mother, Sandra, said she was not surprised by the
events that led to Johnston's release. ``But I'm not happy about
it. It's a hard day for us,'' she said.
   Schultz's father, Donald, said there is no doubt in his mind
that Johnston killed the two. ``He knows who did it. He did it,''
Schultz said in an interview with The Columbus Dispatch.

   A bus plunged into a 600-foot-deep gorge
near this southern city Friday, killing 48 people and seriously
injuring three, police said.
   The bus, operated by the Ormeno bus line, was headed to Lima
from Arequipa, 545 miles southeast of the capital. The accident
occurred between the towns of Tambillo and Vitor, 20 miles west of
Arequipa.
   A spokesman for Ormeno said the bus was forced off the road by a
truck driving in the wrong lane.
   On April 14, a flatbed truck carrying about 70 people careened
off a narrow Andean mountain road and tumbled down a 450-foot cliff
into a river, killing at at least 40 people. Flatbed trucks are
often used in Peru's countryside for passenger transport.
   That accident occurred 50 miles east of Lima, near the town of
Huinco.

   Dealers feared for their art Friday after leaky
roofs at a Chicago landmark and hard rain yielded water damage to
at least five pieces on display at the Chicago International Art
Exhibition.
   The exhibit, with works said to have total value of nearly $1
billion, was to be the last major exhibition at Navy Pier before a
renovation that could cost more than $150 million, said John
Schmidt, chairman of the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority.
   The authority oversees Navy Pier and nearby McCormick Place.
   The Lakeside Group, which organized the exhibition, spent
$500,000 for roof repairs as a condition of staging the show at the
pier, which juts into Lake Michigan from downtown.
   But it didn't prove enough to combat torrential rains Wednesday
night that dumped from more than 4 inches on the Chicago area.
   Barry Bauman, an art expert working with the exhibition, had to
dry out five works sent to him so they could be shown at Thursday
night's $125-a-person opening.
   Bauman said none of the works was irreversibly damaged.
   An estimated value of the wet art was not immediately available,
officials said. They also would not identify the works.
   The exhibit includes works by Jannis Kounellis, Annette LeMieux,
Sam Francis, Donald Judd, Wayne Thiebaud and Sherrie Levine.
Thiebaud, a former Disney animator, designed the posters promoting
the show. The 100 copies of the poster sold for $10,000 each.
   Workers, meanwhile, put up layers of plastic under the roofs of
the two main halls at Navy Pier to try to shield the art from any
more water.
   ``It's like closing the barn door after the cows escape,'' said
Margaret Failoni of Rome's Il Ponte Galleria. One of her pieces in
the show got wet.
   The weather forecast called for an 80 percent chance of rain or
thunderstorms on Saturday, which made some exhibitors nervous.
   ``We've been lucky so far, nothing's been damaged,'' said Penny
Pilkington of PPOW, a New York gallery that had about 20 paintings,
sculptures and other objects on display.
   ``But we don't know if they've done anything about fixing the
roof yet.''
   The two leaky sheds at the pier are housing about half of the
198 dealers at the show. About 65,000 people people are expected to
view the show, which ends Tuesday.
   Schmidt said repairs to solidify the structure as well as to
plug holes were demanded of the Lakeside Group before the show
opened.
   ``This is the last year that we will ever use the sheds,''
Schmidt said. ``They are totally deteriorated.''
   The pier was completed in 1916.
   Tom Blackman, executive director of the Lakeside Group, lamented
that even with the expenditure, ``we still had an awful lot of
water.''
   Some exhibitors, however, did not seem too upset. ``We've been
here before, so we knew what to expect,'' said Chicago gallery
owner Betsy Rosenfield.

   Here's a look at the status of and developments in flooding in
Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas, where intermittent rains fell Friday
and are forecast for the next few days:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>OKLAHOMA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   _Lake Texoma, a popular Red River lake on the Texas line,
crested Monday at 644} feet above sea level _ 27 feet above normal
_ and dipped to 641 feet Friday. The Corps of Engineers expects it
could be 45 to 60 days before the lake returns to a ``decent
level.''
   At Lake Texoma State Park, 270 of 300 campsites are closed;
about half the lake's commercial marinas are either inacessible or
underwater, and 700 concession workers have been laid off.
   _In eastern Oklahoma, the 20 camping areas around Lake Eufaula
have limited access because of high waters.
   _One flood-related death has been reported.

   _The Trinity River, which inundated north Texas after heavy
rains a week ago, brings severe flooding to its watershed as its
crest heads for the Gulf Coast. Authorities warn residents in
Dayton and Liberty counties, about 40 miles east of Houston, to
expect what could be the Trinity's worst flooding in 80 years.
   _The Red River has flooded 40 homes near Texarkana, where almost
200 National Guard troops were in their fourth day of reinforcing
levees. The Salvation Army says it has served 3,000 meals to flood
victims and rescue workers in the past 48 hours in the Texarkana
area.
   _Twenty-five counties have been designated as federal disaster
areas due to flooding, which has cost 12 lives and between $500
million and $700 million in agricultural damage in Texas, millions
more to houses and roads.

   _The Red River crested 8 feet above flood stage Thursday at
Fulton and closed westbound lanes of Interstate 30. Two other state
highways near the Texas line also are closed and expected to remain
so for up to two weeks. In Little River County, an estimated 51,000
acres was under water and thousands of head of cattle were stranded.
   _The Arkansas River slowly is falling from its crests above
flood stage at Little Rock and Pine Bluff.
   _Gov. Bill Clinton, in asking Thursday for a presidential

Panhandling</HEAD>

   Transit police Friday began a vigorous campaign
to rid the rails of beggars one day after a federal appeals court
reaffirmed a ban on subway panhandling.
   ``They told us about it at roll call _ `no more panhandling,'''
an officer at the Grand Central Terminal subway stop said on
condition of anonymity. ``The ruling makes it easier, because it's
going to back us.''
   And the word seemed to have gotten out quickly _ transit police
officers in the subways said there were fewer panhandlers to move
along than usual.
   An unscientific eyeballing through the system seemed to bear
that out, although panhandlers have been fewer since October when
the Transit Authority began its Operation Enforcement to rid the
system of those who disobey the rules.
   On Thursday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1
that a ban on begging in the subway system is constitutional
because panhandlers don't convey a social or political message.
   The decision reversed a lower court ruling that said the
agency's panhandling prohibition was unconstitutional because
begging is a form of free speech protected by the First Amendment.
   The appeals court ruling means the agency can ban begging on
trains, near subway stairways, escalators and elevators and within
25 feet of token booths.
   Also, the appeals court unanimously reinstated a ban on begging
in terminals of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,
which the lower court also had ruled unconstitutional.
   Douglas Lasdon, a spokesman for the Legal Action Center for the
Homeless that brought the lawsuit, said attorneys had not decided
whether to appeal.
   ``My fear is that this decision gives them tremendous authority
and discretion to harass homeless people,'' he said.
   ``You can't decree an end to hunger and homelessness. You have
to deal with the fundamental problems.''
   Sgt. Robert Valentino, a transit police spokesman, refuted that,
saying the ruling applied only to panhandling and the agency was
not taking any additional steps against the homeless.
   Meanwhile, Transit Authority police Chief William J. Bratton and
his top lieutenants mapped strategy Friday morning to begin the
vigorous enforcement.
   ``Panhandling will not be tolerated in the transit system,''
Valentino said.
   Valentino said teletype messages were going out to every field
office so officers and other employees would know that the
banishing of panhandling is a priority.
   Motormen, conductors and token booth clerks were to be
instructed to notify police officers if they see beggars.
   ``They stand right here and beg,'' a token booth clerk at the
77th Street station of the IRT said as he gestured toward the side
of his booth.
   The clerk said that 40 people usually beg at his station. But,
throwing his hand back toward his telephone, he noted that the
instrument has been out five weeks at a time and it would be hard
to notify police.
   ``They need more cops to protect the station,'' he said.
   ``I think it's wonderful because I find it annoying. They give
the city a bad appearance, to tell you the truth,'' train rider
Glenda Silversack said about the ruling.
   ``I'm for it and I'm against it,'' said another rider, Karl
Adams. He didn't mind the passive panhandlers with cups extended
but was bothered by those shouting, ``Yo, you got a dollar, Yo, you
got a dollar?''
   ``There may not be much of a choice. I'm a big male and I refuse
to ride at night. I can't tell the difference between someone
asking for a quarter and ones who put a knife to my throat,'' Adams
said.
   Matthew Vaffney, 67, a resident of the Bellevue shelter who was
begging at Grand Central Terminal, shoved a reporter and said he
had already been interviewed by three other reporters.
   ``You've stopped me from making a quarter,'' he said, jangling
change in a coffee cup.
   ``I do what I think is right'' _ gathering enough money to see
his mother's grave on Mother's Day, he said.

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI agents on Friday seized
luxurious homes, cars, and boats bought with $43 million unearthed
from drums buried in a farm owned by a reputed drug kingpin,
authorities said.
   Agents from the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration
confiscated property in Vega Baja, 35 miles east of San Juan, and
two other Puerto Rican towns as part of an investigation launched
March 10.
   The probe began after authorities heard Vega Baja residents were
using large amounts of cash to buy luxury items, including homes,
cars, motorcycles, boats and jewelry.
   The FBI said it has so far traced $11 million of the $43 million
buried in a farm in Vega Baja allegedly belonging to a drug baron.
Agents also have confiscated millions of dollars worth of property
bought with the treasure.
   The estimate of $43 million is three times higher than when
reports of the buried treasure surfaced in April.
   FBI spokesman Anibal Torres said Friday the 9.7-acre farm
belonged to alleged cocaine kingpin Ramon Torres Gonzalez, who
authorities say runs a ring that smuggles South American cocaine
from the U.S. commonwealth of Puerto Rico to the mainland United
States.
   He said criminal charges against Torres Gonzalez have not been
filed and that an ivestigation is continuing. The FBI refused to
say if it knows where he is.
   ``Ramon Torres Gonzalez is a narcotics importer that has been
directly involved for many years in the importation of multi-kilo
loads'' of cocaine between Puerto Rico and mainland United States,
according to an FBI court document.
   The document, filed with the U.S. District Court for the
District of Puerto Rico and released Friday, said that in early
March, several residents ``sneaked'' into Torres Gonzalez' farm and
took money buried in 22 plastic drums.
   ``After these incidents the persons that stole the money
commenced a big shopping spree wherein cars, houses, jewelry,
motorcycles and other articles were purchased with the drug
proceeds of Ramon Torres Gonzales,'' the FBI document states.
   FBI spokeswoman Alina Bloom said FBI and DEA agents on Friday
seized from the towns of Vega Baja, Dorado and Carolina dozens of
cars, houses, trucks, bulldozers and motorcycles purchased with the
money found in the farm.
   Authorities said the farm had a helicopter launching pad used
for drug trafficking.
   An FBI press release said the seizure of property was supervised
by the office of U.S. Attorney Daniel Lopez Romo.
   Ms. Bloom said the value of the property seized Friday has not
yet been determined. The FBI court document says $32 million of the
$43 million unearthed from the farm is believed still in the
possession of Torres Gonzalez.
   It says $11 million was divided up among more than 10 people,
and that more than $500,000 of the stolen cash has been returned
since March 31 and dozens of cars and trucks, houses, real estate
and jewelry had been recovered prior to Friday's seizures.
   The FBI said Torres Gonzalez ran a construction equipment
company to front his narcotics activities and launder drug
trafficking earnings. Since the investigation began, his farm and
construction equipment has been consficated.
   According to the FBI document, any property bought with the
money is U.S. property because of a law on drug proceeds.
   Torres Gonzalez served a one-year sentence in 1982 in
Tallahasse, Fla., on charges of conspiracy and distribution of
cocaine, the FBI documents says. It said Torres Gonzalez ran a ring
in the 1970s out of New York that smuggled Peruvian cocaine.

   A scientist won't testify at a Congressional panel
investigating accusations that she falsified data in a genetics
research paper she had written with a Nobel Prize-winner, her
attorney said Friday.
   ``She feels very much hounded ... by an unwarranted intervention
and intrusion by the government into the scientific process,'' said
Bruce A. Singal, attorney for Dr. Thereza Imanishi-Kari of Tufts
University.
   Imanishi-Kari is declining to testify Monday before a House
subcommittee reviewing charges she misrepresented research reported
in a 1986 article published in the scientific journal Cell.
   The committee's investigation has focused on forensic studies
performed on Imanishi-Kari's notebooks by Secret Service
specialists who allegedly found as many as 40 pages were prepared
up to two years after their recorded dates.
   Monday's hearing also was scheduled to examine a May 4 forensics
study that suggests the Boston pathologist made fraudulent tape
recordings to support the paper, which was researched at Tufts and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   ``This a case study of how institutions respond or don't respond
... when there are questions or allegations about the quality or
accuracy or integrity of research,'' said Dennis Fitzgibbons, a
spokesman for the subcommittee.
   The Congressional investigation began in 1986 after a former MIT
researcher charged she could not duplicate the published study,
which examined the immune cells in genetically altered mice.
   Investigations were conducted by both MIT and Tufts, where
Imanishi-Kari now works, but both schools reported the research
required no corrections.
   The National Institutes of Health also has investigated the
charges, but Singal said his client would not cooperate unless the
panel detailed the allegations against her.
   ``This is becoming an annual rite of spring, being invited back
to the Dingell committee every May,'' Singal said.
   Imanishi-Kari testified a year ago before the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations chaired by Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich.
   At that time, she told the committee that her notebooks had
nothing to do with the published experiments and showed only that
``I am not a neat person.''
   David Baltimore, an MIT molecular biologist and co-author of the
study, has joined other scientists backing Imanishi-Kari's claim
that the notebook had no bearing on the work.
   ``It is apparent that, after years of investigation, a
reasonable person must conclude that the Cell paper was an honest
report of collaborative research,'' said Baltimore, a 1975 Nobel
laureate who has been named president of Rockefeller University in
New York.
   In a letter sent Thursday to Dingell, Singal said the latest
hearings were ``nothing more than a rehash'' that his client would
decline to attend.
   ``We frankly do not understand why this same set of so-called
findings is now being recycled one year later,'' Singal wrote. ``It
is as insignificant and irrelevant now as it was a year ago to any
legitimate scientific issue.''
   Singal said the Secret Service report issued May 4, and made
public by his client Thursday, contained ``deficiencies and
omissions which ... preclude the possibility of any meaningful
response at this time.''
   He said Imanishi-Kari would be willing to respond to the charges
her tapes were fraudulent after more information and clarification
of the charges was made available.
   Fitzgibbons declined to elaborate on the report, which was to be
the subject of Secret Service testimony Monday.

<HEAD>Shamir: No Prior Knowledge of Jewish Settlement in Old City</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday he
did not know of the government's secret funding of a Jewish
settlement in the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City before
it was publicly disclosed, a spokesman said.
   Also Friday, an Arab killed a Palestinian activist who tried to
burn his house in the West Bank village of Yatta, Arab reports said.
   Shamir made the statement in a conversation with Jerusalem Mayor
Teddy Kollek, said Shamir's aide, Avi Pazner. Kollek just returned
from a visit to the United States, where he met with President Bush.
   ``He (Shamir) did not know of the settlement beforehand,''
Pazner said in an interview.
   Last month, 150 settlers moved into a building owned by the
Greek Orthodox Church, prompting protests by Christian and Moslem
Arabs and touching off a controversy that strained Israel's
relations with the United States.
   The settlers evacuated the building May 1 following an order
from the Supreme Court. Some 20 caretakers remain inside pending an
appeal of the decision. The church claims a former tenant illegally
leased the building to the settlers.
   Officials in the Housing Ministry, led by David Levy, one of
Shamir's leading rivals within the right-wing Likud bloc, disclosed
the ministry secretly put up some $1.8 million to help fund the
settlement and that the Finance Ministry was aware of the funding.
   Shamir has been in charge of the Finance Ministry since the
mid-March collapse of the coalition government that united the
Likud with the center-left Labor Party of former Finance Minister,
Shimon Peres.
   Pazner insisted ``the initial sums were given when Peres was
Finance Minister.''
   He said the remainder of the money was transferred without
Shamir's knowledge and the move did not require his approval.
   Jerusalem city spokeswoman Bonnie Boxer refused to comment on
Shamir's statement.
   She said Kollek ``stands by everything he said, which was that
the settlement in the Christian quarter was a mistake.''
   In recent weeks, Shamir's caretaker government has authorized
the construction of two new settlements, one in the occupied West
Bank and one in the Gaza Strip.
   The United States has protested the construction of the
settlements, calling them an obstacle to peace.
   The occupied lands are home to 1.7 million Palestinians and
about 70,000 Jewish settlers.
   Friday's violence came when a group of Arab activists set fire
to the house of Fatima Ale, believed to be an informant for the
Israeli administration, Palestinian journalists said. Her husband,
Abu Zedan, opened fire with a machine gun, killing Imahem Abu
Zamran, 18, the journalists said.
   Arabs assisting Israeli authorities are sometimes issued weapons
for self-protection.
   The army confirmed the death, but said it resulted from a
conflict between villagers. The incident is under police
investigation, the military said.
   At least 685 Palestinians have died of Israeli gunfire in the
29-month revolt against Israeli rule. An additional 212 have been
slain by their Arab brethren on suspicion of cooperating with
Israeli authorities. Forty-three Israelis have also died in the
violence.

<TEXT>
   The City Council on Friday urged police to
bypass federal prosecutors in cases that could draw the new federal
death penalty for drug-conspiracy homicides.
   The council approved 10-3 a non-binding resolution urging police
detectives in Minnesota's largest city to present such cases to
county or state prosecutors rather than the U.S. Attorney.
   The action came one day after federal prosecutors in Chicago
announced the first use of the death penalty law enacted in 1988.
They said they would seek capital punishment for two men accused of
killing a witness to protect a $50,000-a-day drug ring.
   The federal law allows capital punishment for murders committed
to further drug conspiracies.
   The Minneapolis resolution won initial approval last week by a
City Council panel.
   ``My personal opinion is that the death penalty serves no useful
societal purpose,'' council member Joan Campbell, the resolution's
chief sponsor, said Friday. ``I don't think it's the responsibility
of a civilized society to kill people if they kill other people.
   ``I'm not in any way suggesting that the crimes are not
heinous,'' she said.
   U.S. Attorney Jerome Arnold indicated the resolution would have
little or no effect in determining whether his office would
prosecute a case where the death penalty might be warranted.
   ``What a municipality may do in passing resolutions will have no
effect on what the federal government is going to do in a given
case,'' Arnold said.
   Council member Walt Dziedzic, a former city police officer who
opposed the resolution, said it ``sends the wrong message out there
that this city, this great city, is soft on crime.''
   ``I'm not soft on crime,'' Campbell said. ``I think we ought to
be as tough on crime as we can be up to this point.''
   Council member Dennis Schulstad, the only Independent-Republican
on the Democrat-Farmer-Labor-dominated council, said the resolution
in effect tells drug dealers the federal government is ``too mean''
and that they therefore should be prosecuted by the county attorney.
   ``That is not the message I want to send,'' said Schulstad, who
also voted against the resolution.
   ``We are weak on crime and punishment in Minnesota and don't let
any person tell you differently,'' he said.
   ``I couldn't disagree with you more about the message,'' said
council member Pat Scott. ``I would contend that the people
committing these kinds of crimes aren't listening'' to any arm of
government, he said.
   ``I don't think the criminals are listening to us, Councilman
Schulstad,'' said Council President Sharon Sayles Belton, a former
state probation and parole officer.
   Former Council President Alice Rainville joined Schulstad and
Dziedzic in voting against the resolution.
   Campbell said the resolution reaffirms a vote in the 1989
Minnesota Legislature in which the House Judiciary Committee killed
a proposal to reinstate the death penalty by an overwhelming,
bipartisan vote.
   Minnesota repealed its death penalty in 1911.
   Hennepin County Attorney Tom Johnson, who helped draft the
Minneapolis resolution, said Thursday he hopes the policy statement
``set an example to other jurisdictions and to other cities that
they can say no to the federal death penalty.''

   Showers and thunderstorms dumped more rain Friday on the already
soaked ground of north Texas, southwestern Arkansas and
southeastern Oklahoma, where the flooding Trinity and Red rivers
have caused millions of dollars in damage.
   Flash flood watches were posted through Friday night for parts
of northeastern and north central Texas, where showers ranged into
Oklahoma and western Arkansas.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms also extended from northern
Arkansas to western Alabama. Rain and snow showers fell on the
northern and central Rockies. Rainshowers ranged across southern
South Dakota.
   A few morning rainshowers lingered over the Northeast, but dry
weather prevailed across the rest of the nation by Friday afternoon.
   Strong and gusty northwest winds were ushering cool air into the
Northeast, and gale warnings were in effect for Lake Erie, Lake
Ontario, and the coasts of Maine and New Hampshire.
   Strong northwesterly winds prevailed across the lower Great
Lakes region, upper Ohio Valley, and the middle and northern
Atlantic Coast states. Strong northwesterly winds blew across North
Dakota and northwestern Minnesota.
   Strong southerly winds prevailed from the southern Plains to the
middle Mississippi Valley.
   Strong and gusty winds also blew through the Southwest. Winds at
Guadalupe Pass, Texas, gusted to 67 mph and wind advisories were
posted through Friday night for the deserts of Southern California.
   Temperatures reached the 40s and upper 30s in parts of eastern
Wyoming and northeastern Colorado on Friday, and into the 50s from
the Great Lakes to New England.
   Temperatures were in the 80s across southern Texas, the Florida
Peninsula and the desert Southwest.
   Morning lows were in the 30s and 40s across much of the nation
east of the Mississippi River, with readings in the 20s reported in
Wisconsin and Upper Michigan.
   A number of cities reported record low temperatures for the
date: Columbia, Mo., had a low of 38 degrees, a degree chillier
than the 1952 record; Madison, Wis., was 29, a degree lower than
the '67 mark; Marquette, Mich., was 23 (25 in 1989), and Paducah,
Ky., was 38 (40 in 1969).
   The low for the nation Friday was 21 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.

   Conservationists reacted with anger Friday to
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan's suggestion that a $200 million
telescope should be built despite its potential effect on an
endangered squirrel. ``Do we have to save every subspecies?'' Lujan
had asked.
   Interviewed Thursday by the Denver Post, the interior secretary
noted the controversy surrounding the Arizona project, which could
be stopped under the Endangered Species Act.
   At issue is the Mount Graham red squirrel. All that are left _
fewer than 100 _ are in a colony on the mountain where the
University of Arizona, the Smithsonian Institution and others want
to build a powerful telescope and observatory.
   Conservationists have sought to stop construction because the
squirrel is on the Endangered Species List. In the interview, Lujan
suggested Congress should soften the act and commented:
   ``Do we have to save every subspecies? The red squirrel is the
best example. Nobody's told me the difference between a red
squirrel, a black one or a brown one.''
   He also said the law was ``just too tough'' and added, ``We've
got to change it.''
   As the interview circulated Friday, conservationists vented
their rage.
   Michael Francis of the Wilderness Society said the interview
``shows Mr. Lujan's incredible lack of understanding of biology and
public policy.
   ``I'd have to say he's getting pretty close to another Jim Watt.
... Mr. Lujan certainly is trying to better his mark.''
   Jay Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, said he
was incensed ``that the very Cabinet official whose job it is to be
the country's front-line protector of endangered wildlife would
make such outrageous statements.''
   Hair said that the Mount Graham red squirrel ``is in the 11th
hour of existence on the planet.''
   A spokesman for Lujan did not quarrel with the published
interview, which the secretary gave while attending a National Park
Foundation banquet at the Mesa Verde National Park, near Durango,
Colo.
   Steve Goldstein, Lujan's press secretary, said his boss had
sought only to point out some ``frustrations'' he has had with
enforcing the Endangered Species Act.
   He said Lujan wants Congress to ``determine whether (the law) is
being implemented correctly.''
   Later Friday, after conferring with Lujan, who was in Colorado,
Goldstein said Lujan does not consider the changes he would like
Congress to make as a weakening of the Endangered Species Act.
   ``He wants Congress to look at two things. How far down we
should go in protecting subspecies and what protection should be
afforded when the same species exist in multiple locations,'' said
Goldstein.
   Goldstein said Lujan believes that, increasingly, the law is
being used by people ``as a last recourse to stop economic
development projects they don't like'' and not specifically to
protect endangered species.
   ``Manuel Lujan will diligently enforce the Endangered Species
Act as it is written, but he wants Congress to determine whether
it's being implemented correctly or if it's just being used to stop
development projects,'' Goldstein said.
   Lujan had said in the interview that he expected his views would
``upset a few people.''
   The Arizona controversy is one of several that have surfaced
recently involving the endangered species law.
   The Interior Department also is considering whether to halt the
Animas-La Plata water project in Colorado because of a threat to
the endangered squawfish. In addition, an emotional dispute between
loggers and environmentalists over the Spotted Owl has raged for
more than a year in the Pacific Northwest.
   Lujan said in the interview that he is ``obliged'' under the law
to protect endangered species ``wherever they exist'' without
regard to economic considerations and to take into account only
biological facts.
   But he questioned the narrowness of that requirement.
   ``Do we have to save (an endangered species) in every locality
where it exists?'' Lujan asked.
   He cited the turmoil over the squawfish. In that case, he said,
his department is ``caught between two things.''
   The $582 million Animas-La Plata project would provide water for
four Indian tribes and irrigate southwestern Colorado and New
Mexico farmland. But the water diversion would threaten the
squawfish by depleting water in the San Juan basin.
   ``By law, I am protector of endangered species. And, by treaty,
I am trustee for Native Americans,'' Lujan said.

   Each time the sun comes up or goes down on the
Hubble Space Telescope, the the $1.5 billion instrument wobbles
slightly for reasons engineers still don't fully understand.
   ``It extends for several minutes, 10 or maybe 30 minutes after
we come from the dark to the sunlight,'' Jean Olivier, a top NASA
telescope official said Friday. ``It's only in the later two-third
of the sunlight portion of the orbit that it begins to die down.''
   The telescope orbits Earth every 97 minutes and goes through the
dawn-to-dusk cycle nearly 15 times a day. The stabilization
problem, which showed up earlier this week, is one of many
headaches that have put setup work on the telescope far behind
schedule.
   Still, astronomers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in
Maryland hope they will see the first photograph from the telescope
Wednesday or Friday.
   Olivier said scientists are all but certain that the telescope's
solar arrays are causing the wobble. The two arrays, 40 feet by 8
feet, gather energy from the sun. The energy is converted to
electricity to provide power for the telescope.
   ``What we haven't determined is what is exciting the solar
arrays,'' Olivier said. ``We don't know whether it's something on
board the vehicle that is moving ... it could be the thermal
changes.''
   Olivier said the astronauts of shuttle Discovery, who put the
telescope into its orbit on April 25, saw a slight twist in one of
the arrays _ about a 4-inch difference between one side and the
other. But, Olivier said, it is not known whether that is causing
the problem.
   ``It's not conclusive what that means, its just an observation
the crew made. We're taking it, like everything else, as something
to look at,'' Olivier said.
   The telescope also is rolling slightly, but project scientist Ed
Weiler said that problem is expected to disappear once the
instrument finds star arrangements that match the pattern stored in
computers.
   The first picture to be taken by the telescope is to have a
one-second exposure. The roll is so slight, Weiler said, that an
exposure would have to last 10 to 20 minutes before any movement
was visible in the resulting photograph.

<HEAD>Commission Outlines Widespread Needs of Mississippi Delta</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WOODY BAIRD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The poverty-plagued Mississippi Delta
needs a broad range of remedies, including a regional bank,
expanded Medicaid coverage and magnet schools, to catch up with the
rest of America, says a report released Friday.
   The $3 million report, to be presented to Congress on Monday, is
billed as ``a handbook for action'' for a region of rich soil and
struggling farms, modern hospitals and dying babies. The region is
home to some of the nation's top writers and poorest readers.
   The study offers a long list of ambitious goals and broadly
worded requests for help from federal, state and local governments,
businesses, religious leaders, and just about anyone else who might
be willing to lend a hand.
   But the report by the Lower Mississippi Delta Commission makes
scant mention of where the money might come from to pay for its
recommendations.
   The commmission, created by Congress in 1988 to prepare a
10-year plan for economic development of the Delta, wasn't
responsible for finding sources of funding, said commission member
Ed Jones.
   ``We don't know where the money is going to come from,'' said
Jones, a retired Democratic congressman from northwest Tennessee.
``That wasn't our job.''
   The report defines the delta as a 219-county strip along the
Mississippi River from Illinois and Missouri to Kentucky,
Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana.
   The study's main recommendations include:
   _ Coordination of efforts by federal agencies dealing with
infants and pregnant women to reduce the high rate of infant deaths
in the Delta;
   _ Creation of comprehensive state programs aimed at reducing the
number of teen-age pregnancies;
   _ Expansion of Medicaid coverage for former welfare recipients
who find jobs and increased efforts to attract more doctors and
nurses;
   _ Establishment of a regional bank to pay special attention to
small businesses and those owned by minorities;
   _ Revision of federal tax codes to allow first-time, low-income
home buyers to set up tax-free savings accounts for down payments;
   _ Establishment of model magnet schools in each of the Delta
states and a regional magnet school for math and science;
   _ More money from Congress for Head Start educational programs;
   _ More training for Delta farmers trying to keep up with
advances in agricultural technology;
   _ More loans from the Farm Credit System and the Farmers Home
Administration and simplification of the paperwork for such
transactions;
   _ Additional state and federal money for upgrading highways
throughout the region and for improving rural airports and ports;
   _ Coordination of state and federal efforts for reducing
hazardous waste disposal, protecting wetlands and reducing soil
erosion.

   A chartered jet carrying 11 people
crashed on a steep slope Friday near Mount Emerald in north
Queensland state, officials said.
   An army helicopter spotted the wreckage of the Cessna Citation
10 miles south of the town of Mareeba during a break in fog and
rain early Saturday, said Richard Smith, spokesman for the
emergency center at Brisbane Airport.
   The helicopter crew could not get a close look and was unable to
say if the pilot or any of the 10 passengers survived, Smith
reported.
   He said the weather closed in again almost as soon as the
wreckage was found and the helicopter had to return to base.
   The plane, owned by the Air North Queensland charter company,
was reported missing Friday in a heavily forested area between
Atherton and Mareeba, sugar milling communities 875 miles north of
Brisbane and 35 miles southwest of Cairns.
   Civil Aviation Authority spokesman Bill Evans said poor weather
conditions and heavily forested terrain hampered search and rescue
efforts.
   The aircraft was flying to Mareeba from Proserpine, 360 miles to
the south, and was nearing the end of its flight when it dropped
off radar screens, the Australian Associated Press reported.

<TEXT>
   For French Jews, flourishing more than at any time
in their history, the desecration of tombstones in a southern town
was a brutal reminder of France's long, sordid history of
anti-Semitism.
   From the conviction of army officer Alfred Dreyfus nearly 100
years ago to roundups of Jews by French police during World War II
to the bombing of a Paris synagogue in 1980, anti-Semitism remains
a major fear among French Jews.
   ``Anti-Semitism is a dormant volcano whose eruptions are never
predictable,'' wrote political analyst Robert Sole.
   This week's vandalism and mutilation of a recently buried corpse
in Carpentras came in an era of renewed Jewish pride in France.
   It also coincided with the steady rise of the extreme-right
National Front, a party that has rallied an estimated 15 percent of
voters around an anti-immigrant, racist platform that also targets
Jews.
   Its leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, prides himself on ``saying out
loud what everybody is thinking to themselves.'' He has joked about
the Nazis' crematoriums and called the gas chambers ``a detail''
whose existence was still ``being debated by historians.''
   He regularly rails against ``Jewish lobbies,'' and frequently
accuses the media of being dominated by Jews.
   His followers deny their policies fuel racial hatred and
anti-Semitism, but French Jews aren't so sure.
   Traumatized by World War II, which saw the deportation of some
117,000 Jews from France to Nazi concentration camps, a community
of guilt-ridden survivors harbored fears of new persecution.
   After the war, many renounced their Jewish identities, changed
their names, refused to circumcise baby boys or to give their
children Jewish educations.
   Today, Jewish life is thriving. In the past 15 years, the number
of synagogues in the Paris area has jumped from 30 to 70. In 1950
there were three kosher butchers. Today there are more than 100.
Kosher restaurants, fast-food outlets, supermarkets and
professional caterers are too numerous to be counted.
   Jewish publications boast more readers than ever, and 13 radio
stations broadcast Hebrew and Yiddish songs, cultural and news
commentaries.
   The revival is due largely to the 150,000 Sephardic Jews from
Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia who poured into France during the
1950s and 1960s as the French colonies won independence.
   The Sephardim _ Jews of Spanish origin as opposed to Jews from
Eastern Europe known as Ashkenazic _ make up more than 60 percent
of France's population of about 650,000 Jews. That is possibly the
world's third-largest Jewish community after the United States and
Israel, since immigration has reduced the number of Jews in the
Soviet Union.
   Besides their own folklore and cuisine, the Sephardim brought an
unconditional commitment to Judaism and a demand for Jewish culture
in France.
   In the three decades since they arrived, they have become as
prominent in French life as their Ashkenazic counterparts, enjoying
enviable positions in industry, government, the media and the arts.

   Peru, hit hard by drought, is calling on
industrialized countries and the United Nations to donate food to
help it get through the next nine months, a government spokesman
said Friday.
   For the past year Peru, along with neighboring Bolivia, has been
suffering the worst drought in the region this century. The drought
comes as Peru copes with its worst economic crisis in 90 years.
   The drought has led to strict water rationing in the capital
Lima and its port city of Callao, with a total population of 7
million. Many outlying areas depend on water delivered by trucks.
   Lima's mayor, Ricardo Belmont, has warned that the Rimac River,
the city's main source of water, may run dry by July.
   Peru's electricity supply, which comes mainly from hydroelectric
complexes, has also been cut by the drought.
   Only 14,000 tons of food remain in the counry's storehouses,
said Estuardo Diaz, head of Peru's National Office of Food Support.
He said about 260,000 tons of food were needed.
   Peru is seeking aid from the United States, the European
Community, and wheat-rich Argentina, as well as the United Nations,
Diaz said.
   Agriculture Ministry sources have said more than half Peru's
annual crop of wheat, rice and potatoes has been lost and next
year's crop is threatened.
   The country's Andean mountain regions have been hardest hit.
Many peasants are abandoning the countryside. Thousands of others
have had to slaughter their cattle for lack of feed.
   Peru's main wheat- and rice-producing centers are mainly along
the country's arid Pacific coast and are irrigated by rivers that
flow out of the mountains, which are running at far below normal
levels.
   No substantial relief is expected until the next rainy season,
in November.
   Rising guerrilla violence and the flood of peasants to the
cities have driven down food production for the past decade. Last
year, Peru imported $700 million worth of food.
   Now Peru lacks foreign reserves to step up imports. The annual
inflation rate is topping 2,000 percent, and the government is all
but bankrupt.
   Maoist Shining Path guerrillas have sought for years to cut the
flow of food into Lima, hoping to spark an insurrection in the city.

   President Bush, setting a distant
deadline in space exploration, said Friday that Americans should
walk on Mars by the year 2019.
   ``It's time to open up the final frontier,'' Bush said. ``There
can be no turning back.''
   Bush, who next Tuesday will begin a budget summit with Congress
in an effort to cut the federal deficit, did not cite a cost
estimate for a manned Mars landing or say how the government would
pay for it. NASA has put a $500 billion price tag on the mission,
which would include establishment of a base on the moon.
   Asked how the United States could get to Mars, Bush quipped to
reporters, ``You have to go fairly fast. It's a long way out
there.''
   As for the money, Bush said, ``Thirty years is a long time.'' By
2019, Bush would be 95 years old.
   Bush proclaimed the Mars deadline in a speech at Texas A&amp;I
University, opening a two-day trip of three commencement addresses.
   Later, at a Republican fund-raising event in Columbia, S.C.,
Bush again called for a cut in the capital gains tax rate, saying,
``I'm going to keep on like a broken record until I get that thing
done up there.''
   In his speech at the University of South Carolina on Saturday,
Bush will annouce formation of a volunteer ``Citizenship Democracy
Corps,'' an administration source said.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the corps
would try to help the new democracies of Eastern Europe establish
democratic institutions and legal systems.
   Proclaiming his goal for a mission to Mars, Bush said NASA is in
line for the largest budget increase of any major agency of the
government. He declared that leadership in space exploration
``takes more than just dollars. It also takes a decision, and so
I'm announcing one today.''
   He said he was returning to Texas, his adopted home state, to
announce ``a new age of exploration, with not only a goal but also
a timetable: I believe that before Apollo celebrates the 50th
anniversary of its landing on the Moon, the American flag should be
planted on Mars.''
   The Apollo moon landing was on July 20, 1969, falling within the
10-year deadline set by then-President John F. Kennedy.
   ``Thirty years ago, NASA was founded and the space race began,''
Bush said. ``And 30 years from now I believe man will stand on
another planet.''
   In a speech last summer commemorating the lunar landing, Bush
set a goal of a manned expedition to Mars, but did not specify a
timetable.
   He also proposed completion of a manned space station by the end
of the century and the establishment of a permanent lunar base by
2010.
   ``You are coming of age during a golden age of space,'' Bush
told the graduating students, also mentioning the Hubble space
telescope now in orbit.
   Bush said his space budget proposal was ``proof positive of
America's commitment to an active, exciting and continuing presence
in space, to America's leadership in space.''
   The president proposed $15.2 billion for NASA, a 24 percent
increase, the largest percentage boost for any major agency of the
government.
   Nearly $1 billion of that would contribute directly or
indirectly to exploration. Some $188 million is to begin a variety
of technology studies for an advanced launch system, a lunar
observer and a satellite called Lifesat, which would study
radiation biology.
   Another $775 million includes work on a new power plant and the
Mars Observer mission in 1992. NASA's planning has focused on going
back to the moon in the years 2004 to 2010 and to Mars between 2016
and 2020.
   The National Research Council two months ago said it would be a
mistake to use the space station, the next big American project, as
a staging area for a moon-Mars mission. It said, too, that nuclear
power will be essential for such bases and that nuclear propulsion
for spacecraft should be tested.
   For any Moon-Mars project, the United States would have to
develop rockets with far greater power than those in use currently.
It would need to work also on developing new systems to sustain the
lives of astronauts for a voyage of two years.
   In Texas Friday, Bush made a brief stop to greet flag-waving
youngsters.
   Bush stopped his motorcade, hopped out of his limousine and
shook hands with some of about 100 cheering pupils lining the
street near their school, McRoberts Elementary.
   On Saturday, Bush will deliver commencement speeches at the
University of South Carolina and at Rev. Jerry Falwell's Liberty
University in Lynchburg, Va.

   For the second time in two days, members of
the Soviet Great Circus Bim Bom were kicked out of a hotel Thursday
as circus officials scrambled to get money to pay a lodging bill.
   The 138-member Soviet circus, which had just started a planned
two-year goodwill tour of the United States, is stranded in this
Atlanta suburb without money following a disagreement with its
financial backers.
   Meanwhile, the circus animals are stuck in Newburgh, N.Y. The
company that was transporting the animals took them there, to its
headquarters, when the tour broke off after performances in just
two cities.
   Eight circus leaders were turned away from the Brittany Park
Hotel Thursday, said Ben Silva, art director of International
Showbusiness Inc., a Florida-based firm directing the tour.
   ``When we went there this afternoon, they said, `We don't want
you here.' It was a pretty nasty ordeal,'' Silva said.
   A Brittany Park Hotel employee who refused to give her name said
the eight circus leaders were kicked out Wednesday because one of
them was abusive to desk workers. She said there may have been a
question about whether the circus officials were able to pay their
bill.
   Hotel managers refused to comment.
   Other members of the Great Circus Bim Bom, which includes
performers from 60 Soviet circuses, were kicked out of a Motel 6 in
Marietta on Wednesday.
   Those performers were accepted later that night at a Scottish
Inns of America, where they scrambled Thursday to pay their bills
and keep their rooms.
   Uneko Sugimura Glass, director of operations for the hotel, gave
the circus members till Friday to pay.
   ``We can't help it. I have to pay the employees,'' Ms. Glass
said. ``Tomorrow they'll have to move.''
   The circus used credit to hold the rooms, but Ms. Glass said she
would require cash before the troupe members would be allowed to
stay.
   John Stallion, the circus' promotions director, said a new
financial backer planned to wire $2,000 to him Thursday to pay for
the rooms. He declined to identify the backer.
   The circus came to the United States March 31 for a month of
training in Wheeling, W.Va. After the first performance, in
Hershey, Pa., on April 25, the trip's backers, an Iraqui father and
son, withdrew their support, according to Nikolaj Vissokovsky,
president of International Showbusiness.
   Brooks Savage, an attorney for Waleed A.A. Ahmad and his father,
said the men had given the circus a loan, and had never intended to
back the whole tour. They are out $331,000 plus a promised 10
percent of receipts, he said, refusing to identify Ahmad's father.
   The only other stop was in Johnson City, Tenn.
   The performers came to the Atlanta area because that is the home
of some of the support contractors for the tour.

<HEAD>Noriega Attorney Gets Help From Fidel Castro</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fidel Castro has lent a hand to Manuel Noriega in
his drug-trafficking case, the ousted Panamanian leader's lawyers
said Friday.
   The Cuban president met with Noriega's defense team in March,
said attorney Frank Rubino, adding that he couldn't reveal what
Castro told them due to the classified nature of the information.
   ``Fidel Castro met with some of Gen. Noriega's lawyers and
discussed certain sensitive issues with us,'' Rubino told the Miami
Herald. ``He further provided us with certain documentation.''
   Castro was quoted by a Brazilian television reporter as saying
his information will clear Noriega.
   ``I have even talked with Noriega's lawyers,'' Castro said. ``If
this is the evidence (prosecutors) have against Noriega, then they
have no evidence against him, and I have all the proof which proves
the falsehoods of the accusations.''
   The Cuban leader did not say what kind of evidence he gave the
lawyers, but claimed ``to have all the cards in my hands to
irrefutably prove the lies.''
   According to a February 1988 indictment, the Cuban leader
mediated a dispute in 1984 between Noriega and Colombia's Medellin
drug cartel over a raid on a drug lab the Panamanian leader had
supposedly been paid to protect.
   Noriega is at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside of Miami awaiting trail on charges he took money from the
cartel to make his country a safe haven for cocaine smuggling.
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ordered
prosecutors to explain why it gave $5.8 million confiscated from
Noriega to Panama's new government.
   Hoeveler said it appeared the U.S. government had failed to
follow normal legal procedures before surrendering the cash found
at Noriega's quarters in Panama during the U.S. invasion in
December.
   ``Although it's not common to have $5 million or $6 million in
one's bedroom.... it appears the money was his,'' the judge said.
``That raises an interesting question about what right the
government had to give it away.''
   Hoeveler spoke during a hearing called by defense attorneys,
who've threatened to withdraw, saying they haven't been paid since
Noriega was captured Jan. 4, two weeks after the invasion began.
   Prosecutors have seized $20 million in 27 bank accounts around
the world. The defense says Noriega must have earned at least some
money legally during his 25-year career as military officer and de
facto ruler of Panama, and told the judge it needs some of that
money to represent Noreiga in the complex, expensive case.
   Hoeveler has ordered prosecutors to show why the money shouldn't
be released to Noriega and his attorneys, saying the government has
an obligation to show money was obtained illegally before freezing
accounts.
   Hoeveler also questioned the defense contention that Noriega had
no information of his own about where his assets were, saying he
wanted the general to tell him by the next hearing whether he has
additional accounts.
   Defense attorney John May said Noreiga had not told them about
any additional money, and added that he had no records with him in
jail.
   ``We are not talking about accounts as you or I might have,''
May said. ``These were handled by intermediaries, and certain
people who handled a lot of these matters are under indictment.''
   Defense attorney Steven Kollin said prosecutors have given the
defense information on accounts in the United Kingdom valued at
about $10 million.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan asked the judge to
block the defense from seeing any more details from the list,
saying some of the information could help the defense.
   ``They contain considerable allegations, sources of information
the government has accumulated,'' Sullivan said.
   Defense attorneys said they would accept a stripped-down list
with just the account numbers and the agency currently controlling
them, but the judge did not rule on the issue.
   Noriega had been scheduled to attend the hearing, but Rubino,
his lead attorney, was held up in another case and the attorneys
for both sides decided to proceed without them.
   The judge set a new hearing date for May 21, and Sullivan said
prosecutors would have more information about Noriega's sources of
income by that time.
   The defense has subpoenaed records of the CIA, the Drug
Enforcement Administration and other agencies seeking to show
Noriega received about $11 million in payoffs from the United
States government, as well as up to $7 million more from foreign
governments.

   Pope John Paul II on Friday
comforted the families of pilgrims who died in an airplane crash,
then urged Mexico's downtrodden Indians to fight to improve their
lives.
   ``Don't be seduced by vices, like alcohol abuse, which causes so
many ravages, and don't cooperate with drug trafficking, which
causes destruction to so many people in the world,'' he told more
than 150,000 people at an outdoor prayer service.
   John Paul also expressed concern for refugees fleeing political
persecution and death squads in Guatemala. Tuxtla Gutierrez is
about 100 miles northwest of the Guatemalan border and 425 miles
southeast of Mexico City.
   Behind the altar were misty green mountains in the heart of
Mexico's Indian country. Massed marimbas played and thousands of
Indian women wearing traditional black dresses and red-embroidered
blouses cheered as the pope arrived.
   Before the outdoor service John Paul stopped at the whitewashed
colonial San Marcos Cathedral to pray for 28 pilgrims who died
Thursday in a plane crash while flying in to see the pope.
   ``Death is not the last word, because for those who have faith,
life does not end, it transforms itself,'' the pope said.
``Illuminated and aided by that truth, we raise our petition to the
Lord for those who died and invoke consolation for those who mourn
their loved ones.''
   He kissed a bronze cross on the coffin of Luis Miguel Canton
Marin, bishop of Tapachula, who worked closely with Indian groups.
He then comforted family members, many of whom burst into tears and
kneeled to kiss John Paul's ring.
   At a Mass in Villahermosa, 90 miles north of Tuxtla Gutierrez,
the pope lamented the expansion of U.S.-based evangelical churches
in Mexico, especially strong in Indian areas, and pleaded with
converts to return to the Catholic faith.
   ``I think again about those people who have distanced themselves
from the Catholic Church ... I would like to meet with each one of
you to say: return to the breast of the church, your mother!'' the
pope cried at a Mass for nearly 100,000 people.
   The pontiff's homily reflected growing alarm in the Vatican over
the success of non-Catholic churches in Latin America and
particularly in Mexico. The number of Protestants grew more than
500 percent in Mexico from 1950-80, to 2.7 million. An estimated 90
percent of Mexico's 85 million people remain Roman Catholic.
   As the pope began his homily, a brief earthquake shook Mexico
City, 400 miles away to the northwest. It was not felt in
Villahermosa.
   Mexico's native Indians suffer widespread poverty and
discrimination, and despite land reform laws many have lost their
communal lands to private farmers. Alcoholism is a serious problem;
others have turned to drug trafficking.
   Protestant sects have translated the Bible into native
languages, finding fertile ground in the hopeless poverty of
landless peasants and those who have moved to neighborhoods of
shacks in the cities.
   In Tuxtla Gutierrez, the pope encouraged Indians not to ``lose
hope in the face of poverty or the continuous assalt on your
cultural traditions.''
   He added that the Indian's traditional emphasis on the paradise
of the afterlife was admirable, ``but you also have the obligation
to improve your own human situation.''
   ``Everyone must act in accordance with his own responsibility,
without waiting for all the political, assistential and social
structures,'' the pontiff said.
   Six million people here speak only Indian dialects, and ancient
Mayan is a growing language. The pope greeted Indians in the
indigenous Tzotzil and Zoque tongues, drawing roars of laughter and
cheers as he joked about his own pronunciation.
   ``Now I have a difficult task,'' John Paul remarked as he was
about to embark on a few lines of Tzotzil saying, ``Jesus loves
you, as he loves all his disciples who are `the salt of the earth
and the light of the world.'''
   A rhyming Spanish chant of ``Indians, friends, the pope is with
you'' went up; the pope said ``Yes'' and repeated the line. As
cheering continued, the pope remarked, ``Your shouting is very good
for the pope, because he can rest a little.''

<TEXT>
   Susan Oliver, a star of the old ``Peyton
Place'' TV series and a veteran of many other shows and movies, has
died of cancer. She was 53.
   Miss Oliver, also an accomplished private pilot who made a solo
trans-Atlantic flight, died at Thursday night at the Motion Picture
and Television Hospital, spokeswoman Louella Benson said Friday.
   Miss Oliver played Ann Howard in ``Peyton Place,'' a prime-time
soap opera that ran from 1964 to 1969 on ABC. Her character was
killed off in 1966 by being pushed off a cliff near the fictional
New England town.
   She also appeared on such television shows as ``Star Trek'' and
``The Wild Wild West,'' and in movies including ``Butterfield 8,''
and ``Looking for Love.''
   Born Charlotte Gercke on Feb. 13, 1937, in New York, she was the
daughter of astrology book author Ruth Oliver and George Gercke, a
newsman who became a U.S. Information Agency official in Tokyo. She
lived there as a teen-ager.
   She took up flying in 1964 and eventually began taking part in
air races, winning first place in the 1970 Powder Puff Derby. In
addition to a private license she earned a commercial license and
an instrument rating and also trained in a Lear jet.
   A week after her ``Peyton Place'' character was killed off she
survived the crash of a Piper Cub near Santa Paula, Calif. A friend
was piloting.
   In 1967 she flew a single-engine airplane across the Atlantic by
herself, flying from New York to Labrador, Greenland, Iceland,
Scotland and finally Denmark. Her hope of ending the trip in Moscow
was denied.
   The flight was detailed in her 1983 book ``Odyssey.''
   She did eventually get to Moscow as a State Department delegate
to a film festival.
   Other television appearances included ``The Invaders,'' ``The
Virginian,'' ``Ben Casey,'' ``The Rogues,'' ``The Outsiders,''
``Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' and ``The Defenders.''
   She also had parts on episodes of ``Bonanza,'' ``The Nurses,''
``Dr. Kildare,'' ``Burke's Law'' and ``The Fugitive.'' More
recently she was in ``Murder She Wrote,'' ``Magnum P.I.'' and
``Simon &amp; Simon'' among others.
   She directed episodes of ``M-A-S-H'' and ``Trapper John M.D.''
   Miss Oliver's movie roles included ``Green-Eyed Blonde,'' ``The
Disorderly Orderly,'' ``Your Cheating Heart,'' ``A Man Called
Gannon,'' ``Change of Mind'' and ``Ginger in the Morning.''
   A memorial service will be held at The American Film Institute
in Hollywood but the date has yet to be scheduled, Ms. Benson said.

   An explosion and fire tore through a
Philippine Airlines jet Friday as it prepared to leave Manila,
killing eight people and injuring 82. Officials said a bomb may
have caused the explosion.
   Panic-stricken passengers trampled one another rushing for the
exits, survivors said. Survivors and witnesses gave conflicting
accounts of how many explosions there were before the fire, with
some saying as many as three.
   ``They were still demonstrating the safety equipment when it
occurred,'' said Isidro Retaso, 33, of Iloilo, the flight's
destination. ``There were three explosions, loud explosions, and
the ceiling shuddered. On the second explosion, I immediately
opened the emergency exits.''
   Another survivor, Sony Villareal, 30, also of Iloilo, said she
heard one loud explosion.
   ``After the explosion there was fire and thick smoke billowed.
Everybody panicked after that. People were stumbling over each
other trying to get out of the plane,'' she said.
   Flight PR143, a Boeing 737-300, was bound for Iloilo, 290 miles
south of Manila. It carried 119 passengers and crew members and was
being towed onto the runway at about 3:20 p.m. when the explosion
occurred.
   Oscar Alejandro, director of the government's Air Transport
Office, said the planes engines had not even been turned on yet.
Police were examining the aircraft to determine the cause of the
explosion.
   ``We're looking into the possibility that a bomb was placed
there,'' he said without elaboration.
   Eduardo Carrascoso, the airport manager, said no bomb threat was
received.
   None of the Philippines' insurgent groups has a history of
random terrorism, such as bombing airliners.
   The last time any such incident occurred was in 1976, when a
bomb carried by a would-be hijacker exploded in the toilet of a
Philippine Airlines aircraft flying from Manila to Cebu. The
hijacker was sucked out of the aircraft, and it was not determined
if his motive was political.
   In 1986, a bomb exploded aboard a Thai Airways jet flying from
Manila to Japan, killing one man. Police concluded the man had
bought explosives in the Philippines and was returning to Japan
when he accidentally detonated a grenade in the aircraft's toilet.
   Enrique Santos, vice president of Philippine Airlines, said the
plane in Friday's incident was being towed to the runway when it
was rocked by a single explosion.
   Dante Santos, the airline president, said flames swept through
the plane in only four minutes. One blast apparently occurred near
the center of the passenger cabin, near where the bodies were
found, he said.
   The cabin filled with smoke. Most of the people escaped by
sliding down emergency chutes before flames spread, survivors said.
   Airline employee Alvin Rieta said he was a few yards from the
plane and heard only one explosion. ``Immediately the door opened
and people scampered out,'' he said. ``We suspect it's a bomb, but
we can't confirm it.''
   The bodies of six adults and one child were found inside the
burned-out cabin. The child, a girl, was found clutched to the
chest of an adult woman, presumably her mother, rescuers said.
   Santos, the airlines vice president, said the eighth body was
found shortly early Saturday after the plane was towed to a nearby
hangar. It could not be determined whether the casualty was male or
female because the body was charred.
   At least 82 passengers were treated for injuries at the airport
clinic, according to a airline employee Alfredo Estrella.
Twenty-two of the injured were hospitalized, one of them in serious
condition.
   The blast left three large holes in the top of the plane. It was
towed to a hangar, where agents of the National Bureau of
Investigation began examining it.
   Officials refused to say late Friday what they had found.
   It was not known how many foreigners were among the passengers,
although authorities said a Japanese man was treated for burns. Two
British women escaped injuries, officials said.
   Among the injured were Aurelio Periquet, president of the
Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Rep. Albertito
Lopez, a congressman from Iloilo.
   Officials said the aircraft was leased by Philippine Airlines in
November.
   Tom Cole of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group in Seattle said a
three-man Boeing team was going to Manila to take part in the
investigation. He had no details on the plane's flight history.
   The explosion was the worst aviation disaster in Manila since
July, when a Philippine Airlines BAC1-11 overshot a runway on a
flight from Zamboanga and slammed into a busy highway. Eight
people, all of them on the ground, were killed and 91 people were
injured in that accident.

<TEXT>
   West Germany disclosed Friday that the
price for German unification may include temporarily picking up
part of the tab for Soviet troops based in East Germany.
   In another development, West Germany's chief government
spokesman accused East German communists of inciting labor unrest
in that country. He also said the two Germanys are close to
agreeing on the final terms of a treaty that would merge their
economies in two months.
   The economic merger, which will make the West German mark the
official currency of East Germany, will cause financial problems
for the Soviet Union, which keeps 380,000 troops in East Germany.
   A West German government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Soviet-West German talks began this week in Bonn
over how to cover the living costs of the Red Army troops in East
Germany.
   It appears that Soviet soldiers in East Germany could start
receiving West German marks for their living costs in exchange for
Soviet rubles after the economic merger.
   Such an arrangement would mark the first time a NATO country
ended up paying in its own currency for the stationing of Soviet
troops.
   Under current troop-stationing agreements with East Germany, the
Soviet Union buys East German marks in exchange for so-called
transfer rubles at a preferential rate.
   The East marks are then used to pay for goods and services for
Soviet soldiers stationed in East Germany. These are relatively
inexpensive because of state subsidies.
   But West German officials say two complex problems have to be
worked out in the talks on covering the troop costs.
   When the West German mark becomes the East German currency, some
sort of an exchange rate will have to be established with the
Soviet transfer ruble, which now is not convertible to Western
currencies.
   Also, the economic merger will result in the scrapping of East
German subsidies, and the steep price rises that are anticipated
will also have to be taken into account.
   The West German official said the bilateral talks with Moscow
are just starting and that it is not clear what kind of arrangement
covering the Red Army's stationing costs will be worked out.
   It also remains unclear how much West Germany would end up
paying in deutsche marks to maintain the Soviet troops, or whether
the average Soviet soldier would come out ahead.
   The official said he did not know what the current costs for the
Soviet troops are.
   Any arrangement would be seen as temporary by West Germany. Bonn
has said it is willing to let Soviet troops remain on what is now
East German territory but only during a transition phase in the
unification process.
   Bonn has insisted that a unified Germany belong only to NATO.
Moscow has opposed this, saying that after reunification Germany
should be neutral or temporarily belong to both NATO and the Warsaw
Pact.
   East German Foreign Minister Markus Meckel on Friday said the
idea of united Germany belonging to both alliances was ``absurd.''
Meckel also said he expects a substantial reduction in Soviet
troops soon.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, trying to win Soviet support
for his unification plans, has offered expanded economic ties as an
inducement to Moscow to back down on its resistance to NATO
membership.
   West German government spokeman Dieter Vogel said that Finance
Minister Theodor Waigel will travel to East Berlin on Monday to
discuss the Soviet troops issue with East German officials.
   Meanwhile, West Germany's chief government spokesman, Hans
Klein, accused East German communists of inciting Thursday's labor
unrest in East Germany.
   Tens of thousands of teachers, textile workers and farmers
staged brief protests and strikes on Thursday to demand protection
from the widespread unemployment expected as East Germany moves to
a free market economy.
   Klein said the strike organizers ``are to some extent exactly
the forces who caused'' East Germany's dire economic problems
before last fall's democratic upheaval ousted the Communists from
power.

<HEAD>GAO Says It's Difficult to Ban South African Diamonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ban on imports of diamonds mined in South
Africa could be ineffective and probably would be widely evaded,
according to a a congressional study released Friday.
   Such a ban would have little effect on South Africa's economy,
said the study by the General Accounting Office, the investigating
arm of Congress, because diamonds are only about 2 percent of the
country's exports.
   Diamonds are not covered by the 1986 law that imposed various
trade sanctions on South Africa in an action against the country's
racial separation policy, apartheid. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., asked the General Accounting Office for a report on the
feasibility of banning imports of South African diamonds.
   Diamonds cannot be physically distinguished by country of
origin. The DeBeers Central Selling Organization, which buys most
of the world's diamonds and markets 75 percent to 85 percent of all
diamonds sold in the world, already has refused to cooperate in
keeping track of South African diamonds.
   DeBeers' mines in South Africa, Botswana and Namimbia account
for 36 percent of world production, and 17 percent of the value of
the sales of the selling organization come from diamonds mined in
South Africa, the GAO report noted.
   Diamonds are traded so often before reaching the major consuming
countries that ``many opportunities would arise to create false
certificates of origins for diamonds of South African or unknown
origin,'' GAO said. False certificates already are reported used
for sales to India, which bans diamond imports from South Africa,
the agency said.
   The only possibility of an effective ban would come through
agreements between the United States and other nations with major
diamond cutting indusrtries _ Belgium, India and Israel, the report
said.
   In such a case, GAO said cutters could be forced to chose
between buying from DeBeers and direct purchases from producing
countries, and the producers might not sell to them because they
derive advantages from their DeBeers connection _ notably the
company's marketing expertise and policy of buying diamonds even
when the market is weak.
   But if the producers broke loose, they could capture some of
DeBeers' profits, either independently or in a cartel, at the cost
of assuming the risks of market fluctuations, GAO said.

   Protesting the smuggling of Israeli
weapons to cocaine traffickers, Colombia on Friday suspended a
28-year-old treaty that allowed Israeli citizens to enter the
country without visas.
   Colombia's foreign minister notified Israeli Ambassador Gideon
Tadmor of the decision Friday, a foreign ministry spokesman said.
There was no immediate comment by the Israeli government.
   The decision means Israelis who are in Colombia must apply for a
visa from the government, and Israelis who wish to travel to
Colombia must submit a visa application to a Colombian consulate.
   Israel has claimed it has no knowledge of how a shipment of
weapons it exported ended up being diverted to cocaine baron
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. Rodriguez Gacha was slain in a shootout
with police in December.
   Israel has accused the national security adviser of the
Caribbean country of Antigua, Vere Bird Jr., of playing a key role
in diverting the shipment of Israeli-made arms to Colombia's
notorious Medellin drug cartel.
   Reports have said the weapons deal was arranged by two Israelis,
Maurice Sarfati, a former Israeli army officer, and Col. Yair Klein.
   Colombian officials have accused Klein, a reserve officer in the
Israeli army, of organizing, training and equipping paramilitary
groups, and declared him a fugitive from justice.
   Klein has said the arms shipment was intended for a training
school he wanted to set up in Antigua for Panamanian rebels opposed
to Gen. Manuel Noriega, who was ousted by U.S. forces in December.
   When plans for the school fell through, he said, the weapons
somehow were diverted to Colombia.

   King Birendra proposed Friday a
constitutional reform commission be set up and that monarchy be
institutionalized in Nepal along with a multiparty democracy.
   The move drew fire from the Nepali Congress Party, which led a
movement that forced Birendra to accept democratic changes in the
Himalayan kingdom and on April 6 propelled to power an interim
government made up of pro-democracy forces.
   Party General Secretary G.P. Koirala said, ``We are for a new
constitution. A reformed constitution is out of question.''
   Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai said the king did not
consult him _``It was a surprise.''
   A statement from the royal palace said the proposed commission
would have seven members, with Supreme Court Chief Justice
Biswanbath Upadhyay as chief. ``The constitutional commission will
make recommendations institutionalizing constitutional monarchy and
the multiparty democracy in the interest of Nepal and the well
being of the Nepalese people,'' it said.
   On April 6, police fired into a crowd of pro-democracy activists
marching to the palace, and witnesses said at least 200 people were
killed.
   The outcry forced Birendra to lift a 29-year-old ban on
political parties, dismiss a rubber-stamp government and disband a
partyless system of government known as the Panchayat.
   Nepali Congress is the largest group in the interim coalition
government. A seven-party United Left Front, two independents and
two Birendra nominees complete the Cabinet.
   Bhattarai's government took office April 19, ending 29 years of
rule by the monarch and the Panchayat.

   A regionally divided federal appeals court on
Friday issued an emergency order allowing release of water from a
reservoir in the Dakotas into the drought-shrunken Missouri River.
   The order by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest
development in a battle between upstream and downstream states over
water from Lake Oahe, which stretches through the central Dakotas.
   It allows the Army Corps of Engineers to let water out of the
lake to raise levels in the Missouri, a move the corps and the
downstream states contend is needed to maintain shipping on the
river.
   The 8th Circuit order stays a previous ruling by a U.S. District
Judge in Bismarck, N.D., which ordered the corps to maintain lake
levels through June 1, after the spring hatch of walleye pike.
   The stay was issued by a three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit
until arguments can be heard on the case. The court scheduled those
arguments for May 16 in St. Paul, Minn.
   Judges George Fagg, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Pasco Bowman, of
Kansas City, were in favor of granting the emergency stay. Judge
Roger Wollman, of Pierre, S.D., dissented.
   Montana and the Dakotas want to keep the water where it is _ in
Lake Oahe, a 232-mile long reservoir that cuts through North and
South Dakota. They contend the release would cripple their fishing
industry and tourism.
   Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri want the pent up water
turned loose to keep barge traffic moving and the wheels of
commerce turning in their states. Officials from the downstream
states maintain that drinking water, wildlife and power plants
would suffer, in addition to shipping companies.
   A spokesman for the corps said releases into the Missouri would
be increased again from both Lake Oahe and the last dam downriver,
Gavins Point, which is on the South Dakota-Nebraska border.
   ``Because of the rain we're getting, the effect on Lake Oahe
will be very modest,'' said Paul Johnston, a spokesman for the
Corps' Missouri River Division in Omaha, Neb.
   Attorneys from the Justice Department asked for the stay
Thursday, a day after U.S. District Judge Patrick Conmy in
Bismarck, N.D., issued an order to curtail the flow of water into
the river at the request of the three northern states.

   In an impassioned speech to a city divided by
racial conflicts, Mayor David Dinkins on Friday called on New
Yorkers to end the city's long history of ethnic conflict.
   ``This city is sick of violence and we're aching and we must
heal the pain,'' Dinkins said in the 27-minute speech broadcast by
several of the city's television and radio stations.
   Dinkins, under fire from the media and supporters, offered to
intervene personally in a confrontational, 4-month-long boycott by
blacks of two grocery stores owned by Korean-Americans.
   ``All of us want to live our lives in peace and dignity _ free
to walk any street and shop in any store, at any time, in any
neighborhood, without fear of force or violence,'' the city's first
black mayor told about 300 invited guests.
   ``We will never allow any group or any person to turn to
violence or the threat of violence to intimidate others no matter
how legitimate their anger or frustration may be,'' Dinkins said.
   He mentioned several racial conflicts, including the boycott in
Brooklyn. That controversy has spilled over into the courts, where
a judge chastised Dinkins for not intervening.
   Also, a brawl erupted last week at a Brooklyn college during a
speech by a professor who believes in white superiority. A Columbia
University sports banquet was disrupted by a soccer player's verbal
attack on gays and Jews. Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Jimmy
Breslin was suspended for two weeks by New York Newsday after
slurring an Asian-American co-worker.
   Guests at the speech _ including religious leaders, city
officials and representatives of the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith _ listened as Dinkins spoke in City Council chambers.
   Dinkins noted that New York has many problems, including
expensive housing, crack, AIDS and a faltering economy.
   ``Unfortunately, some small-minded people prey upon these
pressures, spreading a message not of unity but of division,'' he
said. ``I challenge all of the people of this city to reject these
calls to bigotry.''
   Dinkins said blacks, Jews and immigrants from Ireland, Italy and
other countries faced violence as they arrived here. ``It's an old
story, a cycle of immigration and discrimination that's as old as
this city itself,'' he said.
   Dinkins outlined a plan to heal the racial divisions, including
formation of a bias strike force at the City Commission of Human
Rights and a study by the commission of discrimination in bank
lending practices.
   Hours before the speech, a black construction worker was beaten
with bats and billy clubs by as many as five white men in the
Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn. The man was found wandering in
Bensonhurst about a mile away from the attack and was treated for
cuts and bruises, police spokesman Lt. Ray O'Donnell said.
   Police said they didn't know whether the beating was racially
motivated since the victim said no words were exchanged.
   In downtown Brooklyn, two juries deliberated for another day in
the case of two white teen-agers accused of murdering Yusuf
Hawkins, a black 16-year-old who came to their mostly white
Bensonhurst neighborhood to look at a used car.
   Outside the courthouse, 200 to 300 demonstrators and spectators
had gathered by mid-afternoon. Earlier, a small cluster of people
hung a banner reading, ``Civil rights or civil war.''
   Both juries recessed for the evening, and were to resume
deliberations Saturday.
   Emotions at the trial boiled over Wednesday when defense lawyer
Stephen Murphy was punched in the face by one of several hundred
demonstrators demanding murder convictions.
   Demonstrators tried to hit Murphy again Thursday, but he was
surrounded by police and apparently escaped injury.
   Murphy also represented a client in the Howard Beach case, the
last major trial that stirred tensions between blacks and whites in
the city.
   Dinkins, at his Jan. 1 inauguration, described the city as ``a
gorgeous mosaic'' of different nationalities, colors and sexual
preferences. In recent weeks, supporters and reporters harshly
questioned why he had not rallied to the defense of the mosaic.
   ``He believes in what he refers to as quiet diplomacy. He thinks
it will work. And I hope it will,'' said former Mayor Edward I.
Koch.
   But the Rev. Calvin Butts of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem
said, ``We don't need a quiet diplomat _ we need strong, forthright
leadership.''

   An associate U.S. attorney from New York will
coordinate the investigation of package bombs that killed a federal
judge in Alabama and a city official in Georgia, the Justice
Department said on Friday.
   Louis Freeh, a former FBI agent, is being given overall
responsibility for the investigation, the department said in a
statement.
   Judge Robert Vance of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was
killed Dec. 16 in his home in suburban Birmingham, Ala., when a
package delivered to his house blew up when he opened it. On Dec.
18 Robert Robinson, a civil rights lawyer and a Savannah, Ga., city
councilman, was killed by a similar device.
   Package bombs similar to the ones that killed the two men also
were found at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta and
the NAACP office in Jacksonville, Fla., authorities have said.
Those bombs were defused.
   The FBI and other federal agencies investigating the killings
have considered offering a $500,000 reward for information leading
to the arrest of a suspect, sources have said.
   Though the Justice Department statement made no reference to any
progress in the investigation, FBI Director William Sessions said
in a meeting with reporters that leads in the case ``are
consistently moving and progressing very well.'' Asked if the
investigation were at the ``tie-up'' stage, Sessions said: ``We're
not there yet. But we're approaching it.''

   Police on Friday sought a 12-year-old girl
needing heart surgery and her mother, who authorities said abducted
the girl from a hospital because the woman's religion forbids blood
transfusions.
   The girl, Kimberly Winfield, was believed to have left
Children's Memorial Hospital about 1 a.m. Thursday, said police Lt.
Edmund Beazley.
   The mother, Caroline Winfield, called relatives to say she
wanted to return her daughter, said Dave Schneidman, spokesman for
the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. But she
was afraid to surrender for fear of being prosecuted.
   Police obtained an arrest warrant for the 35-year-old mother on
a charge of child abduction because Kimberly is a ward of the
state, Beazley said.
   ``We're not real interested in catching the mother if she
doesn't want to be caught, but we do want the child back so we can
save the child's life,'' Schneidman said.
   Police and the state Department of Children and Family Services
said they were reasonably certain the mother was responsible for
the child's disappearance.
   ``There doesn't seem to be any doubt of it right now,'' Beazley
said.
   ``Before the child was discovered missing, the mother had told
relatives that she was going to take the child from the hospital
because she did not approve of the surgery,'' said department
spokesman Schneidman.
   Schneidman said the child needed open-heart surgery to survive.
``The prognosis is she has anywhere from a week to a month to live
without the surgery,'' he said.
   However, Children's Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Jan Benzies
said Kimberly, who was admitted Wednesday, was not critically ill.
   ``She was undergoing tests to determine the severity of her
heart problem,'' the spokeswoman said. ``Her doctor does not
believe her life is in immediate danger.
   ``However, it is clinically advisable that she be located and
treated within a month,'' she said.
   No one at the hospital saw the mother or child leave, Beazley
said.
   ``Apparently, she just got her dressed and walked out,'' he
said. ``They were allowing the mother to stay in the room with her,
which is pretty common with young children. The nurse came back to
check on them and they were both gone.''
   The mother is a Jehovah's Witness, Beazley said.
   Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions as being against
the teachings of the Bible.
   ``You can't do surgery without a transfusion of blood,''
Schneidman said.
   The Department of Children and Family Services waited about 34
hours after the disappearance to notify the press so police could
check leads on Winfield's whereabouts, Schneidman said. Those leads
were exhausted, he said.
   The agency was named temporary custodian of Kimberly and two
brothers, ages 2 and 8, about a month ago because Winfield was
unable to care for them, Schneidman said.
   ``They were living on the streets without proper housing or any
evident means of support,'' Schneidman said.
   The boys, whose names were not released, are now living with
their paternal grandmother in Chicago, Beazley said.
   A department caseworker noticed Kimberly was ill and took her to
the hospital, Schneidman said.
   Larry Winfield, Kimberly's father, had been notified and was
very concerned, Schneidman said. He maintains a permanent residence
and is employed, but the mother and children have not lived with
him for some time, Schneidman said.

   NASA should buy at least one more space
shuttle because there's a 50-50 chance a craft will be lost in the
next several years, a congressional report suggested today.
   A new shuttle, like the one being built to replace the destroyed
Challenger, would cost $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
   The Office of Technology Assessment said NASA's goal of 14
launches a year poses increased risks to astronauts and that the
schedule could be limited ``to a regular, sustainable rate of eight
to 10 launches'' by limiting flights to payloads requiring human
crews.
   ``The actual reliability of the shuttle system is unknown, but
may lie between 97 percent and 99 percent,'' the report said. ``If
reliability is 98 percent, the nation faces a 50-50 chance of
losing an additional orbiter in the next 34 flights.''

   Opponents of a bill that guarantees workers up
to three months of unpaid leave in family emergencies say they're
confident they can sustain a presidential veto of the measure
passed by the House
   The 237-187 vote Thursday sent the family and medical leave bill
to the Senate, where it faces a contentious and uncertain future.
   Alixe Glen, White House deputy press secretary, called the vote
close and said President Bush remained firm in his opposition.
Bush's aides and spokesmen have threatened a veto.
   ``He fully supports and encourages flexible family leave
policies by all employers, but feels that should not be dictated by
a Washington mandate,'' she said. ``Employers and employees know
what works for them best.''

   Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty
for two men charged with murdering a drug case witness in what
would be the first execution by the U.S. government in 27 years.
   ``We recognize the death penalty is an extreme sanction,''
Andrea L. Zopp, one of the federal prosecutors handling the case,
said Thursday. ``We think it is appropriate in this case.''
   It would be the first use of a November 1988 federal law that
allows the death penalty for murders committed to further drug
conspiracies. The so-called ``drug kingpin'' provisions sanction
the death penalty for murders ordered by drug dealers as part of
their business.
   Alexander Cooper and Anthony Davis are charged with murdering a
federal witness to protect their $50,000-a-day drug ring. Davis is
still at large.

   The coordinator of the government's war on
drugs says he will not change strategy despite a Senate study that
sets the number of hard-core cocaine addicts in the United States
at 2.2 million, more than double the administration's estimate.
   National drug policy director William J. Bennett angrily
rejected suggestions by a Senate committee chairman Thursday that
the administration's focus on discouraging casual use of cocaine
should be changed to give more attention to hard-core addicts.
   The addiction statistics in the Judiciary Committee report
contrast with an estimate by the government's National Institute of
Drug Abuse that there are 862,000 hard-core addicts, defined as
individuals who use cocaine at least once a week.
   The report and the criticism by committee Chairman Joseph R.
Biden Jr., D-Del., touched off a day of feuding between Biden and
Bennett, who said the senator was seeking ammunition for
congressional election campaigns this fall.

   Cheney, speaking with reporters after a two-day NATO meeting in

   ``It's entirely possible,'' Cheney said. ``It wouldn't be the

   The defense secretary said the North Atlantic Treaty

<HEAD>Visit Malaysia Year Boosts Tourism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malaysia started taking tourism
seriously only three years ago, but learned fast.
   One million foreign visitors arrived in the first three months
of 1990, designated Visit Malaysia Year, more than double the same
period of 1989.
   That doesn't count 2 million people who dropped in from
Singapore, the prosperous city-state next door.
   The numbers may not be large compared with renowned vacation
spots, but are impressive for a place that almost had to be coaxed
into putting out the welcome mat.
   ``For a long time, there was no political will to develop the
industry,'' said Sabbaruddin Chik, culture and tourism minister.
   Malaysia remained aloof for years while its neighbors wooed
free-spending foreigners. It is comfortably cushioned by an array
of resources and is developing manufacturing to supplement exports
of natural rubber, palm oil, cocoa, pepper, tropical hardwoods,
tin, petroleum and natural gas.
   Tourism's status as a major international industry finally
prompted the government to create a Ministry of Tourism and Culture
in 1987.
   Chauvinists immediately demanded the names be reversed to give
culture precedence over selling the country to foreigners for
profit, something that might be tolerated but not particularly
liked. They prevailed.
   A speaker told a forum in January the Visit Malaysia Year
campaign is ``making a mockery of Malaysian society,'' something
for which the people are not socially prepared.
   Minister Sabbaruddin's response to that: ``If you wait until
everything is ready before you promote tourism, we will never, ever
be ready.''
   Promoters try to reconcile their goals with the conservative
habits of a country that has Islam as its official religion.
   While the culture has no tradition of tourism, it does put a
premium on hospitality. Both social dictates and Islam enjoin
Malaysians to treat guests better than themselves.
   There are limits, however. Without consulting Sabbaruddin, the
Culture Division of his ministry banned a Valentine's Day
performance by pop singer LaToya Jackson, elder sister of Michael
Jackson.
   She posed seminude for Playboy magazine last year, Kuala Lumpur
newspapers reported, and an official said her presence was
``against the values and norms of the local culture.''
   Visit Malaysia Year, launched with much hoopla in 1988, was
designed to attract foreigners and get them to stay longer, foster
the arts and culture and encourage locals to see Malaysia first
before they venture abroad.
   Appointed mascot was Wira the orangutan, representing an
endangered species of ape found only in Borneo and Sumatra.
Independence Day, Aug. 31, is the anchor for 84 major events, 14
festivals and nine exhibitions.
   Malaysia offers distinctive Malay, Chinese and Indian cultures
along with the architectural heritage of its Portuguese, Dutch and
British colonizers.
   There are unspoiled jungles, spectacular coral, clean beaches
and hill resorts above the tropical heat. One resort has a casino.
   Sightseers can watch rubber trees being tapped and monkeys
helping harvest coconuts from tall palms. In Borneo, they can spend
the night in the longhouses of former headhunters.
   The official target for the year is more than 4.2 million
tourists and earnings of $926 million, compared to 3.9 million
people and $741 million last year. Malaysia was fourth in the
region in 1989 after Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore.
   Before the campaign began, tourism promoters worried that
Malaysia had no readily identifiable image abroad, except perhaps
as the country that had sentenced 250 people to death for drug
trafficking since 1975 and hanged 84 so far.
   Simple possession of more than 15 grams (0.529 ounces) of heroin
or 100 grams (3.53 ounces) of marijuana is regarded as trafficking
and the death penalty is mandatory.
   Officials were not amused when comedian Steve Martin, an
announcer on the Academy Awards telecast in March, told an
international live audience:
   ``We would have liked to have gone `live' from Malaysia, but the
TV crew got hung at the airport.''

<HEAD>Saturday Night Fever: Americans Savor It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDIE GLAVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saturday night: a night to dance, make love,
commit murder, get drunk, watch television, go cruising, rent a
video, go out to dinner _ or read a book about what people do on
Saturday night.
   Author Susan Orlean hopes a lot of people will chose the latter
and pick up her new book, ``Saturday Night'' (Alfred A. Knopf,
$19.95).
   Orlean, a former Boston Globe columnist and free-lance writer,
explores the magic of Saturday night in an episodic journey through
the lives of such diverse people as Wellesley co-eds, Bowery drug
addicts, a Park Avenue socialite and a suburban baby sitter.
   The writer traveled to 16 spots across the country. She went
cruising with car enthusiasts in Elkhart, Ind., watched diners at
the nation's busiest restaurant in Saugus, Mass., and even spent a
Saturday night locked in the bowels of an MX missile silo outside
Cheyenne, Wyo.
   ``Fundamentally, it's a travel book that does travel through an
idea rather than a landscape,'' Orlean said in an interview at her
Manhattan apartment.
   The sociological question of what makes Saturday night special
is neatly folded into each chapter. Orlean cites Saturday night
facts: It's the night the fewest long-distance phone calls are
made, the fewest suicides occur, the fewest airplane flights are
scheduled.
   It also is the night when most murders occur, the most liquor is
sold by the glass and the highest number of reported incidents of
cow toppling in rural Pennsylvania occurs. Cow toppling involves
pushing a cow over as it sleeps. Cows sleep standing up. Local
college kids think this is a zany prank; the cows do not.
   But it is sociology offered in a non-academic way, thanks to
Orlean's witty and descriptive writing.
   In a chapter on polka dancing at Blob's Polka Park in Jessup,
Md., Orlean highlights a sprightly, 82-year-old named Cecelia
Kostler who has 350 polka outfits and lives for her Saturday night
polka fix.
   On one Saturday night, Orlean writes that Cecelia was ``feeling
more original than traditional.''
   So she dressed herself in ``a ruffled white blouse, black
bell-bottomed stretch pants, a silver vinyl belt with a large
square buckle, silver spike-heeled sandals, a gold chain with
walnut-sized links and, as the most eye-catching addition, a
side-vented, back-belted, zipper-fronted vest made of red Chinese
satin and black-and-white artificial pony fur.''
   Orlean also conveys the frustration of jailed criminals, the
expectations of recovering drug addicts, the merriment at a Texas
zydeco social and the hopefulness of 15-year-old Hispanic
debutantes.
   ``My theory, ... `Does Saturday night matter to people?' got
proved fast. The answer was, yeah. So I decided to use Saturday
night as my net,'' Orlean said, ``and I think what I caught was
interesting.''
   Orlean was amazed that none of her would-be subjects turned her
down. ``That really goes against my own premise that Saturday night
is a very private time. Here I was asking total strangers to let me
intrude, and they did. ... I would probably turn me down.''
   She did experience one rejection of sorts. She was asked to
leave socialite Nan Kempner's Park Avenue home _ by the rear door,
of course _ before guests arrived for a formal dinner party.
   ``That struck me as interesting. It was the only place that
people drew the curtain. It was a more private world than a nuclear
missile silo.''
   Another subject, a drug dealer who was supposed to take Orlean
along on his Saturday night rounds, never panned out,
   ``We tried to get together about six different times and I
finally gave up because he said he was just too busy. I later found
out he got out of the drug business to sell aluminum siding.''
   She also learned after completing the book that one of the
convicted criminals she quoted liberally in a chapter titled
``Killing'' came to an abrupt end _ he murdered a federal drug
agent in New York after being paroled and was later himself
mysteriously gunned down.
   ``That certainly made me feel creepy,'' she said.
   The only normal Saturday night activities Orlean didn't get to
explore were going on a first date and staying home watching
television with a couple. ``I just couldn't figure out a way to do
that, insert myself in the situation without changing it,'' she
said.
   ``Those are the private type of Saturday night moments that are
just going to have to remain that way.''
   One of the most difficult tasks in researching the book was
deciding what to wear at each stop.
   ``I guessed wrong a lot of times,'' Orlean said, like the time
she went club hopping with a pair of Los Angeles teens, who had a
different outfit for every stop. Orlean chose a simple black
outfit. ``They were horrified and told me to make sure I told
everyone I was from out of town.''
   But without a doubt the hardest thing for Orlean was giving up
three years of her own Saturday nights.
   ``I never got used to being away and working on the weekend,''
she says. ``It mattered. I suffered. I hated it.''

<TEXT>
   Mention Saudia Arabia, and most people won't
think of sharks. Or bats. Or baboons.
   How about monsoon rains _ or migratory birds splashing around in
marshes created from 40,000-year-old fossil waters?
   These and numerous other natural wonders actually exist in Saudi
Arabia, and they're captured on film for disbelieving Western eyes
in a new three-part series, ``Arabia: Sand, Sea &amp; Sky,'' debuting
Tuesday on cable TV's Discovery Channel.
   The series, by British producer-director Michael McKinnon,
should give viewers a new perspective on a region mostly associated
with sand dunes, oil fields and ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
   McKinnon was researching his 1985 documentary on the Arabian
culture, ``Treasure of the Gulf,'' when he discovered that the
western end of Saudi Arabia along the Red Sea harbored a wonderful
abundance of wildlife, vegetation and strange geological forms.
   Coral reefs sheltered fish, eels and sharks. On land, there were
mangroves. In the foothills, forests of junipers, acacias and palms
were inhabited by birds, bats, lizards, butterflies and large
mammals, including hundreds of thousands of baboons, mountain
camels and small herds of the rare ibex. Farther north, the
remnants of extinct volcanoes created a pseudolunar landscape.
   ``I said, `My God, this is a completely unknown thing,'''
McKinnon recalled in a recent interview.
   His documentary series has proved to be an eye-opener not only
to Westerners, but to Arabs as well.
   ``I think it will be a surprise for most Arabian viewers,''
McKinnon said.
   At preview showings of the series, he said, ``It's been a
consistent reaction among people of the peninsula that there was
this diversity of wildlife in the peninsula.''
   The first episode, ``The Mountain Barrier,'' focuses on the
relatively lush foothills along the western and southwestern coasts
of the Saudi peninsula. The greenery owes its existence primarily
to a 1,000-mile string of western mountains reaching 13,000 feet
high that wring most of the moisture out of eastward-sailing Red
Sea clouds.
   At the same time, oil-financed irrigation projects seem to be
creating a new ecological order. Migratory birds have changed their
routes to take advantage of newly created wetlands from irrigation
projects that are pumping fossil waters from 3,000 feet beneath the
parched surface.
   Cinematographers John Bulmor and Tony Bomford do a fine job in
capturing these images, and Richard Kiley provides suitably spare
narration.
   The second episode, ``Red Sea Rift,'' deals with the rich
underwater flora and fauna along the Red Sea coast. The final
segment, ``Eye of the Camel,'' focuses on the mammoth southeastern
sand desert, the Rub Al Khali, and the traditional Bedouin
lifestyle that is under siege from agribusiness, oil and
superhighways.
   McKinnon noted that conservation is making a comeback in Saudi
Arabia after traditional means of preserving the fragile landscape
were swept aside as petrodollars transformed Saudi life virtually
overnight.
   The Saudis created the National Commission for Wildlife
Conservation five years ago as improved transportation and
irrigation systems pushed crops and livestock into areas that never
before would have supported farming or grazing.
   Wheat and sorghum fields seem to be a boon to wildlife, but
grazing isn't.
   McKinnon said the future of the peninsula's wildlife will depend
on how well the Saudis preserve vegetation from herds of goats and
sheep.
   ``There's a big move now ... to protect flyways for birds, to
fund new breeding grounds for gazelle, ibex, to set aside areas for
conservation,'' he said.
   There are other hopeful signs. He said that in some protected
areas, ``botanists are finding desert plants they didn't know
existed.''

<TEXT>
   Slowly, deliberately, Richard Davis loads his
.44-caliber Magnum handgun. He grasps the pistol with both hands,
points it at his abdomen and stares ahead grimly. He fires; his
body jerks with the impact.
   A grin spreads across his ruddy, weather-beaten face. ``Nothing
to it, folks,'' he says with the satisfaction of a man who has shot
himself more than 130 times as a sales pitch for the bulletproof
vests his company manufactures.
   But despite Davis' confidence in his product, the federal
government is pushing national standards for body armor that he and
other producers consider unreasonable. The feud has become so
bitter that some law enforcement groups, for whom vest quality is a
life-or-death matter, are asking Congress to intervene.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said he expects to introduce a
bill to establish mandatory standards this month. Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., has written Attorney General Dick Thornburgh urging him to
mediate a compromise. ``The increasing uncertainty can only hurt
law enforcement officers,'' Levin wrote.
   The highly technical debate boils down to four issues: how the
vests should be designed, particularly the amount of stuffing
needed to stop bullets; how they should be tested for
effectiveness; who should set the standards; and whether they
should be voluntary or mandatory.
   The National Institute of Justice, a branch of the Justice
Department, has set voluntary standards for vests and tested them
for quality since the early 1970s.
   During testing, vests are mounted on clay blocks and bullets are
fired into them from varying distances and angles. To meet NIJ
standards, a vest must not only stop bullets; it must also prevent
them from making an excessively large dent in the clay. That's
because a bullet can strike with enough force to damage internal
organs even if it doesn't penetrate the vest.
   The government toughened its standards in 1987 to keep pace with
changes in weapons and ammunition, said Lester Shubin, science and
technology director for the NIJ.
   Suddenly, more than 50 percent of the vests were flunking the
tests.
   Manufacturers _ including Davis' Second Chance Body Armor of
Central Lake, Mich., _ cried foul, saying the only way to ensure
that their vests consistently passed was to make them so thick and
bulky that police wouldn't wear them.
   ``Police officers don't really want to wear the stuff, anyway.
Give them any excuse to take it off and they will,'' said Ed
Bachner, ballistics manager for E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. His
company manufactures Kevlar, the synthetic fiber used in most
bulletproof armor the past 20 years.
   ``Police are dying because they aren't wearing vests, not
because the vests are bad,'' Bachner said.
   Surveys show that only about 30 percent of police wear vests,
even though many law enforcement agencies require it, said George
Austin Jr., national executive officer of the Fraternal Order of
Police. Manufacturers say the number may be lower.
   Du Pont has documented more than 1,000 ``saves,'' or incidents
in which wearing Kevlar body armor prevented death or serious
injury, Bachner said. Most are shootings, but many saves have
involved stabbings, auto accidents and even a couple of bull
gorings.
   A single vest retails for about $350, Davis says, although he
recently sold 4,000 to the Detroit Police Department for $175
apiece.
   Larry Gates, executive director of the Personal Protective Armor
Association, an industry group, says no vest has ever failed to
protect a wearer from bullets it was designed to stop.
   ``They've performed flawlessly in the field, where it counts,''
he said. ``But in the laboratory tests under the NIJ standards,
over half the vests fail. The test is flawed ... but the NIJ won't
budge.''
   Shubin counters that vests have a good field record because his
agency's tests have kept duds off the market.
   ``We believe a lot of their armor is marginal,'' he said. ``But
we believe if it passes our standard it's going to work 100 percent
on the street, and it has. We're being faulted for being
successful.''
   Last year, Du Pont and the Personal Protective Armor Association
established their own standards, which they say produce more
consistent test results while meeting wearers' comfort requirements.
   Shubin and many police leaders aren't convinced.
   ``I could put up with a little discomfort in exchange for extra
protection,'' said Austin, the FOP officer and a Poquoson, Va.,
beat cop. ``And I'm the one out there on the street getting shot
at.''
   Police generally have sided with the government in the dispute,
although not unanimously.
   New York City Police Commissioner Lee Brown, who favors the NIJ
standards, calls the debate over vest design and testing procedures
a ``smoke screen.''
   ``The issue is who's going to develop the standards,'' Brown
said. ``I want them developed by someone who has no vested interest
in selling a product.''
   The Fraternal Order of Police wants Congress to designate a
non-industry body such as the NIJ to set national standards, and
the International Association of Chiefs of Police has taken a
similar position.
   But the State Association of Chiefs of Police, a division of
IACP, voted last month to oppose congressional intervention and to
ask the manufacturers and the NIJ to accept binding arbitration.
   One vest manufacturer that supports the government standards is
Point Blank Body Armor of Amityville, N.Y. Company president
Richard Stone says the industry's primary motive is to protect
Kevlar's dominance of the bulletproof vest market.
   ``This is basically a commercial situation,'' Stone said. ``Du
Pont's had a virtual monopoly on body armor for 20 years and they
want to keep it that way.''
   Du Pont's Bachner disagrees, saying the controversy arose before
the recent emergence of competing synthetic fibers. ``I tell police
if they can find a better product they ought to buy it,'' he said.

   He may not be as famous as Jim Henson, but
in his own way, Frank Ballard has done as much to advance the art
of puppetry in the United States as the man who brought us Kermit
the Frog and Miss Piggy.
   For 23 years, Ballard has directed the puppetry program at the
University of Connecticut, the first school in the United States to
offer a bachelor of fine arts degree in puppetry and the only one
with bachelor's and master's programs still in existence.
   In a series of basement rooms overrun by scraps of cloth,
woodworking tools, sewing machines and an endless supply of
puppets, Ballard has taught students how to design and make
marionettes, hand puppets and stick puppets. He shows them how to
operate the dolls, write scripts and stage large-scale puppet
productions.
   Ballard's students have gone on to work for Henson on various
Muppets projects, movie production companies in Hollywood and their
own traveling tours. One former student is a psychologist, using
puppetry in therapy, and another designs toys for Fisher Price.
   ``I guess I've worked all my life trying to upgrade the
standards of puppetry,'' said Ballard, 60, who plans to stop
teaching this year and devote his time to creating a museum for the
thousands of puppets he and his students have created, from tiny
hand puppets wearing intricate clothing to larger-than-life
monsters with wagging tongues and rolling eyeballs.
   ``I'd like to ... see the art respected and accepted as a true
art form rather than kiddies' play.
   ``To do that, part of it is the responsibility of the
puppeteers, who have to upgrade the quality of their work. Part of
the problem is there's no formal training in puppetry.''
   In Europe and Asia, puppetry has a strong tradition, with
countries in Eastern Europe offering subsidized puppetry training
to students and then often providing them with jobs.
   Puppetry doesn't enjoy such status in the United States, where
puppets are generally thought of as the cute and cuddly domain of
children. Several of Ballard's students say they had trouble
convincing their parents that it was worth spending four years in
college for a puppetry degree.
   Ballard has worked to change that image, through his classes and
the grandiose, adult productions his students have staged, such as
``Macbeth,'' ``Peer Gynt,'' ``The Fantasticks'' and ``H.M.S.
Pinafore.''
   ``We do large productions here because nobody else can _ to give
as many students an opportunity to work in productions as possible
and to teach the audience, because the preconceived notion of what
a puppet is so squared in,'' Ballard said, sitting with five
students at a table covered with glue droppings, saw dust and
puppet eyes.
   In the world of puppetry, Ballard and his program are well
known. His students have performed a puppet opera at the Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, and Ballard has
addressed the United Nations General Assembly.
   Ballard has served as president of the Puppeteers of America and
L'Union Internationale de la Marionette. He has been honored by the
New England Theatre Conference and by the Connecticut Commission on
the Arts. Last year, President Bush saluted Ballard in a letter,
praising him for his contribution to the arts.
   Perhaps the best testament to Ballard's fame came a few years
ago when one of his students was traveling in the Soviet Union,
where puppeteering enjoys great popularity.
   The student was pulled aside and interrogated by police, who
wanted to know what he was doing in the Soviet Union. All the
student had to do was mention Frank Ballard and the University of
Connecticut, and he was immediately released by some very impressed
and friendly Soviet security agents.
   Ballard's love for the craft began when he attended a puppet
show at age 5. He received a puppet for his birthday and began
staging his own shows, eventually putting himself through college.
He came to UConn in 1956 to teach in the Dramatic Arts Department.
Within a few years, he was teaching puppetry, and in 1966 began
offering bachelor's degrees.
   The University of California at Los Angeles and the University
of Hawaii eventually began puppetry programs, but both have since
folded.
   Ballard is not giving up the helm of UConn's puppetry program
because he wants to, but because his health requires it. He has
Parkinson's disease, a degenerative neurological disorder that
causes tremors and muscular rigidity.
   ``I can't manipulate my hands anymore and I can't perform,'' he
said. ``It gets harder. I'd rather stop now than be carried out.''
   Technically, Ballard retired last fall, but he continued to
teach this year because he didn't want to see the puppetry program
end while the school searched for his replacement.
   For Rolande Duprey, one of two graduate students in the program,
ending the puppetry program would have been a disaster.
   Starting last spring, Duprey began preparing for a performance
she finally staged a few weeks ago. First, she chose a 15th-century
French farce called ``Pierre Pathelin.'' Then she translated it
into English, and rewrote it in verse, adding a few more characters
and deleting some of the monologue to make it more appropriate for
a puppet show.
   Last summer, she began molding heads for the main characters.
Then she began making bodies and stitching costumes and a curtain.
She also trained puppeteers, some of whom were newcomers.
   ``You have to do it because you love it, something like this
which can be so difficult, so demanding _ you have to love it,''
Duprey said, showing off one of her lifesize _ and lifelike _
creations, an old man hand-and-stick puppet whose haughty eyelids
open and close and jowls droop to perfection.
   Sandy Bellock, a UConn senior and puppetry major, agreed that
the puppetry program was demanding because it requires students to
design, create, act and write, but that's why she likes it.
   ``All my life I've been interested in the arts as a whole _
dance, acting, music _ and I discovered puppetry was an art form
that would allow me to combine my interests,'' she said.
   ``Plus I like the idea of creating a whole reality. Instead of
just casting a bunch of characters, you get to create characters. I
call it the God complex.''

   The Peace Corps is undergoing an impressive
revival as increasing numbers of foreign governments seek the kind
of low-cost expertise the volunteer agency provides.
   ``In the next 18 months, we will enter more countries than were
entered in the last 18 years combined,'' says Paul Coverdell, the
former Georgia state legislator who has served as Peace Corps
director for the past year.
   President Bush, who has stressed the importance of volunteerism,
is a big booster of the Peace Corps. At a time of budget austerity,
Bush is showing his commitment by asking for $181 million for the
Peace Corps for 1991, a record $16 million increase.
   Congress also has been supportive, partly because of the 20
former volunteers who have since become lawmakers.
   Everything seems to be going the Peace Corps' way lately.
Internationally, governments are showing less interest in ideology
and more concern about solving human problems. For many of them,
the Peace Corps is a logical place to turn.
   The anti-communist evolution in Eastern Europe last year opened
up a whole new region from which the Peace Corps had previously
been excluded. When the agency was created in 1961, East bloc
countries were asked whether volunteers would be welcome. The
answer: No, thanks.
   With English becoming increasingly accepted as the language of
international business, what better agency than the Peace Corps to
fill the need for classes?
   ``Everybody wants to learn English,'' Coverdell said. The Peace
Corps also sends out experts in agriculture, urban development,
engineering, health, nutrition and a new area suddenly in vogue:
the environment.
   ``There's no institution ready to do so much for so many for so
little,'' said Coverdell, an Atlanta businessman and long-time Bush
backer.
   After an auspicious beginning under President John F. Kennedy
almost 30 years ago, the Peace Corps eventually fell into disfavor
in the mid 1970s.
   Enrollment dropped along with the budget. Watergate and the war
in Vietnam made many qualified young people cynical about serving
in a government agency, and applications fell. Some volunteers were
haunted by charges they were CIA operatives disguised as do-gooders
_ even though Kennedy, early on, ordered the CIA to stay away from
the agency.
   President Nixon stripped the Peace Corps of its independent
status, making it a part of an umbrella volunteer agency. In the
process, the corps lost some of its unique identity. The agency
became independent again in 1982.
   The current enrollment, 6,500 volunteers and trainees, is still
far below the late 1960s high of more than 15,000. But Coverdell
predicts that almost 7,300 will be serving by the end of 1992.
   When Coverdell, 50, took over in May of 1989, the Peace Corps
was operating in 64 countries. By the end of this year, he expects
that figure to rise to 76.
   Volunteers will be at work in Hungary and Poland in the coming
weeks and in Czechoslovakia in a few months. Initial contacts with
Bulgaria and Romania have been made, and even Mongolia, one of the
world's most isolated countries, has shown interest. Latin American
countries that once shunned the Peace Corps are now welcoming
volunteers.
   ``There is broad expansion on every continent,'' Coverdell said.
   Obviously, the Peace Corps can have only a marginal impact on a
given country. The Philippines historically has had the largest
number of volunteers _ there are about 300 there now _ but poverty
remains pervasive, afflicting well over half the population.
   And as the first Peace Corps director, Sargent Shriver, sees it,
the volunteers, not the host country, get more out of the
experience than anyone.
   As always, Peace Corps performance is impaired by some
volunteers who view their two-year stint less as a commitment to
the poor than as a chance to see exotic places. But not since the
halcyon days of 1961 has the agency's image been as favorable as it
is now.
   Compared with those early years, when the ranks of the Peace
Corps were dominated by young liberal arts graduates, the agency
projects a grayer appearance nowadays, thanks to the 12 percent who
are over 50.
   The average age of all volunteers is 31, a more mature force
than the one envisioned by Nixon who, campaigning against Kennedy
in 1960, said the Peace Corps would become a discredited haven for
restless youth _ a ``Kiddy Corps,'' as Nixon described it.

<HEAD>Conservatives Aim New Criticism at Liberal Justice Marshall</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDITORS NOTE: The Supreme Court's nine members are among the most
private of public officials. They wield enormous power, but rarely
hold news conferences or give interviews. Recent polls indicate
only one in three Americans can name any of the nine. This, the
eighth in an occasional series, offers an up-to-date look at one
member of the nation's highest court.</HEAD>

   Thurgood Marshall's place in history was
assured before he became a member of the Supreme Court in 1967. Now
his conservative critics, long distressed by Marshall's liberal
record, say it's time for the first black justice to step aside for
a more youthful, energetic successor.
   Marshall, a civil rights pioneer who as a lawyer helped changed
the nation, will be 82 in July. He shrugs off questions about
retirement with customary curmudgeonly humor.
   ``I have a lifetime appointment and I intend to serve it,'' he
has said numerous times. He once told The Washington Post, ``I
expect to die at 110, shot by a jealous husband.''
   For decades before President Johnson named him to the high
court, Marshall had traveled the nation as the recognized legal
champion of the poor and the powerless. Some say he ranks with the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as a leader in the battle for racial
equality.
   Over 23 years as legal director of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People and then as the federal
government's solicitor general, Marshall argued 32 cases before the
Supreme Court. He won 29.
   His biggest NAACP victory came in the 1954 ruling that declared
racially segregated public schools unconstitutional.
   ``He changed America,'' said Erwin Griswold, the onetime Harvard
University Law School dean and himself a former solicitor general.
   ``When I think of great American lawyers, I think of Thurgood
Marshall, Abe Lincoln and Daniel Webster,'' said Georgetown
University Law School Dean Thomas G. Krattenmaker.
   Experts agree Marshall's legal accomplishments before joining
the high court far surpass those of any fellow justice. It is his
stature as a justice that has been questioned of late by
conservative critics.
   They say he is losing interest in much of the court's day-to-day
work and delegates too much responsibility to his young law clerks.
   Former clerks deny it. Marshall declined to be interviewed for
this article.
   One of the harshest attacks on Marshall was penned by Terry
Eastland, onetime aide to former Attorney General Edwin K. Meese
III. Eastland last year wrote in the conservative National Review,
``One joke has it that if Marshall retired, at least he wouldn't be
paid for watching television.''
   The reference apparently was prompted by earlier reports that
Marshall is a fan of ``The People's Court'' and watches the TV show
in his court office. The justice has denied the reports, saying,
``That's an awful program.''
   Criticism of Marshall's supposed work habits are often
accompanied by questions of his health.
   Standing 6 feet 2 and overweight, Marshall shuns exercise. He
had a heart attack in 1976, has suffered from bouts of pneumonia
and bronchitis. He was hospitalized in 1987 with a potentially
dangerous blood clot in his right foot.
   Marshall walks slowly and with apparent difficulty. Family
members reportedly convinced him a few years ago to stop driving;
he now gets to work in a chauffeur-driven limousine.
   Former clerks, however, insist his health is not deteriorating.
   Georgetown law professor Mark Tushnet, a Marshall clerk in 1972,
said, ``He did not look in good health then. He doesn't look any
different now.''
   Tushnet, who is writing a biography of Marshall, also dismissed
the idea that the increasing dominance of the court's conservatives
has soured Marshall.
   ``He seemed grumpy when I worked with him and he seems grumpy
now,'' Tushnet said.
   Legal scholars say a succession of conservative court
appointments has denied the old civil rights fighter the chance
that was briefly his to shape the law. Within two years of
Marshall's appointment to a predominantly liberal court, Chief
Justice Warren Burger replaced Earl Warren and the court's
evolution toward conservatism had begun.
   ``But Marshall has been very important in providing visions of
where the law should go,'' said Krattenmaker. ``He has written
several (dissenting) opinions that may prove to be persuasive.''
   Marshall and Justice William J. Brennan are the court's most
consistent liberals and most frequent dissenters.
   They stand alone in opposing capital punishment in all
circumstances, press for broader protection for criminal defendants
and lead the way in supporting affirmative action for minorities
and women.
   Marshall's former law clerks call him the court's conscience and
say his role is one of making sure the other justices realize their
decisions are affecting real, flesh-and-blood people.
   Marshall suffers from glaucoma. At times, it seems he has
trouble reading summaries of his opinions from the bench. At a
celebration of his 80th birthday, he insisted that television
camera lights be turned off because the glare bothered his eyes.
   Rumors of declining alertness were fed by an incident last fall
during an oral argument session before the court.
   Marshall posed several questions to a lawyer he seemingly
believed was representing the government when, in fact, the lawyer
was representing the other side.
   ``If I appear confused, I am,'' Marshall said at one point. When
another justice noted whom the lawyer represented, Marshall
recovered by telling the lawyer, ``Well ... there is no bar to you
giving me some help.''
   Marshall's public appearances away from the bench are rare. But,
when he does appear, he doesn't mince words.
   In televised interviews in 1987, he said President Reagan's
civil rights record ``ranks at the bottom,'' and accused Meese's
Justice Department of trying ``to undermine the Supreme Court
itself.''
   In a speech to a conference of lawyers and judges that year, he
said he was not about to quit fighting right-wingers.
   ``Don't worry, I'm going to outlive those bastards,'' he said.

   Edwin Cooperman's successes at American Express
Co. are recounted nightly in commercial television scenes.
   There's the toddler who feeds the new videocassette recorder
gloppy breakfast cereal. The traveling executive who loses his
charge card just before trying to check into a hotel for the night.
The Yuppie dad who cancels all appointments and buys a fishing boat
to take his kid on vacation.
   They are stories with happy endings, thanks to American Express
and Cooperman, who as president of the Travel Related Services
division is the man behind those scenes.
   During Cooperman's three years at the helm of the card division,
American Express has introduced such innovations as a ``Global
Assist'' 24-hour help line for cardmembers, the ``Optima'' extended
payment card, and buyer assurance plans guaranteeing charged items
against loss, theft or damage.
   The ads pitching these extras aren't concocted by copy writers.
They are based on real calls and letters to American Express, which
has made service a cornerstone of the card division under Cooperman.
   Trim and slightly graying at 46, Cooperman spends a majority of
his time on the road or in the air, visiting the company's
far-flung ofices, from Beijing to Berlin, Singapore to St. Louis.
   He's not a Mastercard or Visa holder, but keeps five American
Express cards in his wallet _ Platinum, Gold, Green, Corporate and
Optima.
   ``Each one has a different use,'' he said. ``My daughter, of
course, now she wants five. But that's a whole different story.
She'll stick with her two.''
   A lawyer by profession, Cooperman has been with the company for
nearly two decades. He has an 18-year-old card-carrying daughter in
college and another 15-year-old daughter in high school.
   When he's in his 40th-floor corner office overlooking southern
Manhattan, Cooperman studies the competition intensely, collecting
newspaper and magazine articles about the card business.
   He especially enjoys showing visitors a yellowed clipping by
financial columnist Dan Dorfman, portending the demise of American
Express's growth. It was written 10 years ago.
   ``Since that time we've had the greatest growth in our
history,'' Cooperman said.
   There has been speculation that Cooperman's division may feel
increased pressure to perform now because of weaker sister
businesses, notably Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which has been
pinched by the recession on Wall Street and freshly bankrolled by
its American Express parent.
   Cooperman said he's not overly concerned.
   ``I think we're going to run our business as usual. But you know
all the employees and myself, we stand a little taller these days.
We want to show the strength of the company,'' he said. ``So I
guess in that respect, we put pressure on ourselves.''
   Cooperman's division spends a lot of money _ by some estimates
the company's advertising budget is about $250 million, more than
Visa and Mastercard combined _ but Cooperman is no moneyloser.
   Rising from relative obscurity in the company's General Counsel
office, he has helped make Travel Related Services the most
profitable part of the company. Last year, for example, the
division earned $830 million on revenue of $8.4 billion.
   By contrast, the company's IDS Financial Services unit earned
$175 million, American Express Bank earned $122 million,
Information Services $83 million and Shearson $110 million.
   Cooperman helped pioneer the push into high-tech advancements
that American Express uses to battle Visa and Mastercard. American
Express computers enable it to replace a card anywhere within 24
hours, check a cardmember's credit history instantly and provide
help ranging from airline tickets to bail money.
   Even in mundane monthly billing, Cooperman said, American
Express has introduced an imaging technology that provides
customers with copies of each charge receipt they've signed.
   ``Our competitors give you nothing,'' he said. ``They've moved
to just telling you what you bought but not giving you the copy
back.''
   Competitors have watched the number of American Express Cards in
the United States grow to more than 24.3 million, up more than 50
percent since late 1985 when Cooperman took command. The card is
accepted at more than 3 million establishments worldwide, more than
double the number at the end of 1985.
   Still, Visa and Mastercard remain the dominant plastic in the
United States, with a combined total of about 90 percent of the
market or more than 200 million cards.
   American Express may give more, they concede, but customers pay
more in membership fees and cannot finance payments, unless they
have an Optima card.
   Financial services analysts say they're not sure how many
inroads American Express will make into Visa and Mastercard
territory. Nonetheless, most express admiration for the card
division and Cooperman.
   ``When you call up American Express with a problem, you get much
better service,'' said Gary Hovis, who follows the company for
Argus Research Corp. in New York. Cooperman, he said, ``seems to be
a very good executive, a very hard worker. I think he's a plus for
the business.''
   Bruce Brittain, head of an Atlanta-based market research firm
that studies credit-card use, said the quality of service likely
will remain an advantage for American Express over bank-issued
credit cards.
   ``No matter what Visa or Mastercard promise, it boils down to
what kind of service you get from the issuing bank,'' Brittain
said. ``You always hear about the horror stories. There's a real
advantage to having one central issuer.''
   The high-profile television ads are a hit with Cooperman, who
stresses the factual base for the company's service claims. The VCR
ad, for example, ``was based on a letter from the mother of this
child, who told us this incredible story. It was a positive letter
of how pleased she was, and how quickly American Express helped her
out and got a new VCR.''
   Not all cardmember feedback is so effusive. But Cooperman
displays a sense of humor about the limits of some services, such
as the lost-stolen-damaged guarantee.
   ``Obviously anytime you launch a new program like this, you're
not going to think of everything,'' he said.
   A farmer's demand that American Express compensate him for a
milkless cow purchased with a card led to a no-animal proviso,
Cooperman said. In another instance later excepted from the policy,
a cardmember billed American Express for a dozen golf balls whacked
off a fairway.
   ``Under our policy at that time, that was not excluded so we
sent the gentleman a funny letter back, and a check, and told him
the next time, perhaps, he ought to tie a string to each golf
ball,'' Cooperman said.
   ``Just imagine every golfer in America buying their golf balls
with the American Express card. Great business, but the way I play
golf ... we'd lose a lot of money.''

   In the long-running debate over whether the
economy is growing too fast or too slowly, Wall Street has begun to
entertain the possibility that neither side is right.
   A surprising run of statistical reports in recent days has
prompted some analysts to toy with the idea that conditions are
close to a happy medium _ favoring continued slow but steady growth
without any drastic change in inflation.
   Few people in the forecasting business are content simply to
proclaim ``clear skies ahead'' and flip the switches off on their
computer-powered crystal balls. As practitioners of the dismal
science, they are paid to worry continuously about whatever might
go wrong.
   Still, just a few hints that the economy might be maintaining a
healthy, sustainable momentum have been enough to lift the stock
market to near-record levels of late.
   For the moment, neither the inflation nor the recession worries
that have beset the financial world in recent months appear to have
come to fruition.
   ``Some economists are convinced that the economy could fall into
a recession because there is a credit crunch in the financial
markets,'' said Edward Yardeni at Prudential-Bache Securities.
``We've argued that this is just another scare which will soon blow
away.
   ``So far the optimistic approach seems to be outperforming the
pessimistic approach to investing, although we admit that the first
four months of the year were not kind to bond investors.
   ``We believe the inflation scare which unnerved the bond market
is just about over, and the credit crunch scare may soon be over as
well.''
   The mood in the markets began to brighten early this month, with
interest rates having hit their highest levels in a year.
   The Labor Department's report on April employment, showing much
slower than expected growth in jobs, seemed to signal that the pace
of business wasn't strong enough to support the kind of
inflationary expectations that had been building.
   That positive view took on some fresh urgency Friday, when word
came of a 0.3 percent drop in the producer price index of finished
goods and a 0.6 percent decline in retail sales last month.
   That helped the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials post a
91.22-point gain for the past week to 2,801.58, not far short of
the record closing high of 2,810.15 reached on Jan. 2.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index up 6.83 at 192.24; the NASDAQ composite index for
the over-the-counter market up 9.49 at 438.10, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index up 6.77 at 352.50.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 164.34 million shares a day, up
from 139.90 million the week before.
   The revival of optimism in the stock market by no means reflects
a unanimously rosy view of the outlook.
   Indeed, some economists on the Street lately have lowered their
estimates of growth for the spring and summer months, at the same
time that others are raising their projections.
   Inflation fears die hard, especially in the bond market.
Furthermore, analysts remain mindful of how frequently and rapidly
sentiment has shifted among investors recently.
   ``The economy and inflation have given false signals in the
past,'' says the Value Line Investment Survey in its current
appraisal of business prospects. ``Volatility is likely to remain
the order of the day.''

<HEAD>CEOs Get An Earful During Annual Meeting Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders of some of the nation's biggest
companies, angry over lower profits, higher debts and rising pay
for executives, are using the annual meeting season to vent their
displeasure at management.
   Discontent was particularly evident this past week as executives
of CBS Inc. and Pan Am Corp. were put on the defensive at raucous
meetings. At the Time Warner Inc. and USX Corp. gatherings,
shareholders used votes on stock incentive plans for management to
express their dissatisfaction.
   At CBS, the issue was the third-place finish for the company's
television network over the past three seasons. Shareholders
criticized the dearth of directors with broadcasting experience on
the CBS board and the poor quality of the network's programming.
   Chairman Laurence A. Tisch was forced to concede the company's
prime-time TV performance has been ``a total disaster,'' but he
tried to mollify shareholders by pointing out CBS is No. 1 in
daytime and sports ratings.
   ``We are not a total disaster,'' he said.
   The angry shareholders at Pan Am's meeting were employees of the
airline, which hasn't made money since 1980.
   Teamsters union members, furious because they have been working
under conditions imposed by the company for two years since
federally mediated contract talks failed, repeatedly interrupted
Pan American Corp. Chairman Thomas Plaskett at the meeting in Miami.
   The USX annual meeting had been expected to be one of this
season's most dramatic as shareholders there considered takeover
strategist Carl Icahn's proposal to split up the steel-energy
company.
   But Icahn's plan didn't stir up shareholders as much as
management's proposal for its new stock incentive plan for
employees. Shareholders who took the floor at the meeting _
including several retirees of USX subsidiaries _ angrily questioned
why management was lining its own pockets at the expense of
stockholders and pensioners.
   Results of the voting on Icahn's proposal, the stock plan and
other issues were not expected until this coming week at the
earliest. Icahn, however, has already conceded his idea _ which
would have spun off the company's U.S. Steel subsidiary from its
Marathon Oil Co. division _ was likely to fail.
   Time Warner executives found themselves answering the same
question they were faced with a year ago: Why didn't Time Inc.
accept a $200 a share buyout bid from Paramount Communications Inc.
last year instead of buying Warner Communications Inc. and going
heavily into debt?
   Several disgruntled shareholders criticized management because
of the company's $10.8 billion debt load and losses attributed to
the $14 billion Warner acquisition. They also were unhappy with a
stock price that is now less than half the Paramount bid.
   But, like the USX meeting, the biggest expression of shareholder
unhappiness was over the vote on management's stock incentive plan.
The proposal passed, but one-quarter of the shares voted were
against it.
   Grumbling at annual meetings is nothing new, although
shareholders _ in particular the big institutions like pension
funds _ have become more active in recent years.
   Dale Gerboth, a partner at the accounting and consulting firm
Ernst &amp; Young, said he's seen no overall increase in shareholder
anger this season, although particular companies with particular
problems may have more irate stockholders than other firms.
   Although large shareholders, including the institutions, are
able to communicate with management at other times over the course
of the year, the annual meeting is ``still an effective avenue for
making a voice heard'' for stockholders, Gerboth said.
   In other business developments this past week:
   _Signs of an economic slowdown were evident in government
reports of falling wholesale prices and a decline in retail sales.
The numbers were greeted jubilantly on Wall Street, where stocks
swept ahead, bond prices rallied and interest rates dropped. But
the dollar tumbled.
   _President Bush and congressional leaders announced talks to cut
up to $100 billion from the rapidly expanding federal deficit. Tax
increases as well as spending cuts will be considered.
   _Southern California's aerospace industry took two big hits as
McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it would lay off another 1,000 workers
at its Long Beach aircraft unit and Lockheed Corp. said it would
move its Burbank aeronautics operations to Georgia and Palmdale,
Calif. The job losses reflected major cuts in defense spending
resulting from the thaw in East-West relations.

   The nation's top three banking regulators told
bankers they weren't imposing a ``credit crunch'' through overly
aggressive regulation.
   In an unprecedented meeting with the country's largest banking
association, the regulators also urged banks to keep lending money
to sound businesses.
   The officials, led by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan, attended Thursday's board meeting of the American
Bankers Association to respond to charges that over-regulation is
making bank credit too difficult to get for real estate developers
and other businesses.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
outlined plans to reform the nation's financial system, including
charging banks with risky investments more for deposit insurance.
   In his first extensive remarks on deposit insurance reform,
Greenspan told a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference
Thursday that the issue ``should be high on our agenda'' as the
government considers permitting banks to expand into securities and
insurance.
   He suggested varying insurance premiums according to the
riskiness of a bank's investments, examining banks' books more
frequently, seizing weak banks faster and requiring bank owners to
risk more of their own money.

   Americans took out $2.6 billion more in
consumer credit than they paid off in March as borrowing to buy
automobiles rebounded from February, the government said.
   The Federal Reserve said Thursday that consumer credit increased
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.4 percent, up from a
revised 0.1 percent rise in February.
   Borrowing increased at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the
first quarter, compared with 7.6 percent for all of 1989 and 8.5
percent for 1988, reflecting a dampening of economic growth.

   Bond prices rose in response to the bond auction, but lower
rates weakened the dollar. It fell to two-year lows against the
Swiss franc and West German mark despite rising against most other

offset the effects of less defense work.

to pick up slack,'' Hensley said.
   The cuts have left some workers bitter.
   ``It's a war zone in there,'' said Muriel Carr, 54, a shipping

<HEAD>Pacific Nations Poised for Modest Recovery in 1991</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States' trade deficit is set to
worsen significantly despite declining surpluses for Japan, South
Korea and other Pacific nations, according to a new forecast.
   Countries around the Pacific rim also are poised for a modest
rebound in growth next year after a self-imposed two-year slowdown
designed to rein in inflation, said the report released Thursday by
The Asia Foundation.
   Japan saw its trade surplus narrow in 1989 despite a sharp
depreciation in the yen relative to the dollar, which makes its
exports more competitive and imports more expensive.
   The country's trade surplus _ which declined to $57.3 billion
last year from $78.8 billion in 1988 _ should drop to $42.7 billion
this year before edging up to $45.5 billion in 1991, according to
the foundation's Pacific Economic Outlook for 1990-91.
   Taiwan's balance of payments surplus in the region is forecast
to drop to $10.4 billion this year and $9.2 billion in 1991 from
$11.1 billion last year.
   Similarly, South Korea will see its surplus fall from $5.1
billion last year to $1 billion this year and $300 million next
year, the report says.
   The United States, meanwhile, is expected to move the other way.
   After cutting its balance of payments deficit in the region from
$118 billion in 1988 to $96.6 billion in 1989, the deficit is
expected to rise to $105 billion this year and $116 billion in 1991.
   The United States can help itself by cutting its own budget
deficit, says Lawrence B. Krause, an economics professor at the
University of California-San Diego who helped produce the report.
But Krause sees no likelihood of America regaining a trade surplus
with Japan or the rest of the Pacific region in the next few years.
   The outlook, an important tool used by planners in the region,
is based on analyses and predictions by economists from 15
countries affiliated with the Pacific Economic Cooperation
Conference.
   The region's powerhouses all slowed their economies with tight
monetary policies to curb inflation.
   Most countries in Latin America, Africa and Southern Europe
would have been happy with the 1989 inflation rates of the
Pacific's leading economies _ 2.3 percent in Japan, 4.4 percent in
Taiwan, 5.7 percent in South Korea, and 4.9 percent in the United
States, as measured by the consumer price indexes.
   Overall, the region's inflation rate was 6.5 percent, a figure
bloated by rates of 17.6 percent in China, 10.1 percent in Hong
Kong and 10.6 percent in the Philippines.
   The tight money policies are expected to bring inflation down in
1991 to 1.5 percent in Japan, 3.3 percent in Taiwan, 6.0 percent in
South Korea and 4.8 percent in the United States.
   The region's overall inflation rate should drop to 5.5 percent
next year with China cutting its rate to 9.5 percent, Hong Kong to
7.0 percent and the Philippines to 9.7 percent.
   Krause said the region's declining growth rate should moderate
this year and pick up slightly in 1991.
   The forecast calls for growth of 5.0 percent this year, down
from 5.3 percent in 1989 and 7.2 percent in 1988.
   ``The forecast has a modest recovery in 1991, up to 5.2 percent,
so it will have taken two years to moderate the excesses and then
have some recovery again,'' Krause said.
   One notable exception from that growth forecast is Japan, where
growth is expected to decline from 5.1 percent in 1989 to 4.3
percent in 1990 and 3.1 percent in 1991.
   The United States is expected to remain stuck with one of the
region's lowest growth rates _ 3.0 percent in 1989, 2.5 percent in
1990 and 2.8 percent in 1991.
   The region's growth leader, Thailand, should slow from a rate of
11 percent last year to 9.1 percent this year and 8.4 percent in
1991, with Singapore and Malaysia slightly behind.
   China's political crackdown last year hurt its economy and Hong
Kong's, but did not have much impact on the rest of the region, the
report said.

<HEAD>Traders' Defense Keyed To Market Confusion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>^By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for three commodity traders facing
federal fraud charges are keying their defense to the seeming
bedlam of the futures markets.
   They say the government's main witness, an undercover FBI agent
who observed and secretly tape-recorded evidence of alleged
wrongdoing at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, was so befuddled by
the frantic nature of commodity trading that he mistook the
defendants' legitimate actions for attempts to defraud customers.
   ``It's been referred to as organized chaos,'' defense attorney
Alan Blumenthal said of commodity trading during his opening
statement Thursday to the U.S. District Court jury.
   ``It is within that confusion that you are going to question
whether agent (Randall) Jannett had the opportunity to observe what
he claims to have observed,'' Blumenthal said.
   Blumenthal is defending David Zatz, an independent trader of
Swiss franc futures who along with Robert D. Mosky and Danny L.
Scheck faces multiple counts of mail or wire fraud and violating
federal futures-trading rules.
   Mosky also is charged with racketeering conspiracy.
   Mosky worked as a floor broker, filling customer orders from a
number of brokerage firms, as well as trading for his own account.
Scheck was strictly an independent trader, known as a local.
   Their trial before U.S. District Judge Ann C. Williams is the
first to result from an unprecedented FBI probe of trading fraud at
the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's two largest
commodity futures markets.
   Prosecutors have portrayed the three as common criminals who
conspired along with at least two other traders to divert to their
own accounts profits that rightfully belonged to brokerage
customers.
   The government called its first witness Thursday, an
investigator for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission who began
the arduous task of educating the jury about commodity trading.
   A Swiss franc future is a contract to buy or sell a specified
number of Swiss francs at a future date at a price agreed upon in
advance.
   Like other commodity futures, Swiss franc contracts are traded
in a designated arena, called a pit. There, traders stand shoulder
to shoulder and strike deals through a rapid-fire combination of
hand signals and shouted bids and offers.
   The government's case rests largely on conversations secretly
recorded by Jannett while he posed as a corrupt trader in the
Merc's Swiss franc pit during the last 11 months of 1988.
   Prosecutors also plan to call as witnesses two other Swiss franc
traders, William Walsh and Mark Fuhrman, who have pleaded guilty to
fraud charges.
   The defense lawyers discounted Walsh and Fuhrman as corrupt men
who are seeking light sentences for their crimes.
   And they portrayed Jannett as determined to uncover trading
fraud despite inadequate preparation for the frenzied, confounding
environment into which he was placed.
   ``The FBI can send an agent into a trading pit but that won't
make him a commodity trader,'' said Scheck's lawyer, Harvey Silets.
   The government contends the FBI tapes reveal a variety of fraud
schemes.
   But Silets and Elliott Samuels, Mosky's lawyer, said the tapes
portray their clients' proper attempts to verify trades they made
with each other and Jannett amid the hubbub of the trading pit.
   Prosecutors have stressed that the conversations Jannett
recorded were secretive, which the government says indicates the
traders were trying to conceal their actions.
   But Samuels said exchange and federal rules require traders to
verbally confirm their trades immediately after they make them.
   This trade-checking, ``by nature, has to be secret, private,
one-on-one,'' Samuels said.
   ``That's what agent Jannett recorded,'' Samuels said. ``He
recorded my client's compliance _ not violation of any rules.''
   The three men are the first suspects to be tried out of 47
Chicago futures traders and a clerk indicted last year as the
result of the FBI sting operation.
   Sixteen of those indicted have pleaded guilty to reduced charges
in return for their cooperation.

<HEAD>Investment Firms Seek Management of Nuclear Plant Decommissioning
Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two investment firms have formed a joint venture
to manage the money utilities are required to set aside to pay for
the eventual dismantling of nuclear power plants.
   John Nuveen &amp; Co. Inc. and Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. have announced
they have formed Nuveen-Duff &amp; Phelps Investment to offer
investment management services to nuclear utilities.
   Nuveen spokesman Jeff Kratz said estimates of the cost of
decommissioning the nation's 110 nuclear power plants range from
$100 billion to $1 trillion.
   ``The cost for an individual utility may not be very great,'' he
said, ``but we are talking about a very substantial amount of money
overall.''
   Kratz said Nuveen-Duff &amp; Phelps would advise the utilities on
how to invest their decommissioning funds.
   He noted that Nuveen &amp; Co. specializes in non-taxable
investments such as municipal bonds and Duff &amp; Phelps specializes
in taxable fixed income and equity securities. The utilities will
require both kinds of investments to finance the decommissionings,
he said.
   ``We will appear at rate hearings to provide expert testimony on
what rates of return the utilities are receiving,'' Kratz said.
``We will act as advisors to utilities, keeping them abreast (of
the market) and in general be prepared to assist them to meet the
decommission liabilities.''
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission only recently has required
utilities to set up funds to pay for plant dismantling. The
utilities have until July 26 to show how they will finance the
shutdowns.
   NRC spokesman Jan Strasma in Chicago said the federal agency
requires the utilities to either prepay the entire decommissioning
cost into an independent fund, establish a sinking fund and pay
into it gradually, or establish a surety bond that guarantees
payment of decommissioning.
   Depending on the size and type of plant, the utility would have
to set aside $105 million to $135 million for each reactor.
   Decommissioning involves taking the fuel out of the plant,
decontaminating the unit and removing the reactor.
   ``The idea is to return the site to pristine condition for other
uses,'' said Cathy Roche, spokeswoman for the U.S. Council of
Energy Awareness, an industry group based in Washington, D.C. ``It
is a fairly long-term process.''
   ``Decommissioning is an expensive process, and we want the
utilities to have sufficient funds to do it,'' Strasma said, adding
the funds cannot be used by the utilities for operating expenses.
   He said laws vary from state to state on how funds can be
invested.
   Under rules established by the Illinois Commerce Commission,
Illinois-based Commonwealth Edison _ which operates 13 nuclear
plants _ is limited to investing its decommissioning funds in U.S.
Treasury bonds, bank certificates of deposits and tax-exempt bonds.
   ComEd official Debbie Vestal noted that in 1989, the utility put
$66 million into the fund, which is handled by four investment
firms, including Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. of New York.
   Before 1989, ComEd integrated its decommission funds into its
operating fund, from which it received a higher rate of return.
   The new fund is covered by a different tax bracket, which lowers
the rate of return, said Ms. Vestal. However, she said it is
difficult to judge how well the investment firms are doing with the
account because there is nothing to compare it with.
   Scott Peters, a spokesman for the U.S Council for Energy
Awareness, said there are currently no nuclear plants up for
decommissioning, although a number of plants are idle.
   But he said the technology exists that could extend the lifetime
of the plants. ``Utilities may find that it is cheaper to refurbish
plants than replace them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Apparel Stores Continue To Outperform Other Retailers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Buoyed by the popularity of this year's Easter and spring
merchandise, apparel retailers chalked up strong sales gains in
April and continued to outperform the rest of the retailing
industry, according to results released by several big store chains.
   Analysts said department stores, which have lagged specialty
retailers for some time, showed signs of improvement in the figures
released Thursday.
   Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer,
posted a 16 percent gain at stores open at least a year and an 18
percent overall increase.
   Gap Inc., another big apparel retailer, reported its
comparable-store sales jumped 25 percent last month as overall
sales gained 31 percent.
   Clothing is ``the key item that's continuing sales growth,''
said Karen Sack, a retail industry analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp.
   Results from stores open a year or longer _ known as same- or
comparable-store sales _ give a more accurate reading of a
retailer's performance.
   Retail sales are closely watched not only as a gauge of the
health of the industry and individual companies, but also as an
economic barometer. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds
of the gross national product.
   Among the big department stores, Dayton Hudson Corp., whose
holdings include Dayton's and Hudson's department stores and Target
discount stores, said its comparable-stores sales rose 5.5 percent
in April, while overall sales picked up 11.7 percent.
   May Department Stores Co. _ which owns Lord &amp; Taylor, Foley's,
Filene's and other chains _ said its comparable-store sales rose
8.8 percent as overall sales improved 14.3 percent.
   Many stores that had sluggish sales in March fared better in
April as consumers shopped for Easter and spring clothing.
   K mart Corp., the nation's largest discount chain, recorded a
6.3 percent comparable-store gain, and a 15.9 percent rise overall.
In March, K mart suffered a 1.1 percent drop in comparable-store
sales.
   Calendar shifts _ such as Easter falling on a different date
from one year to another _ can affect retail sales, inflating one
month's figure and detracting from another. The industry tends to
consider March and April together in assessing how well stores did.
   Kurt Barnard, a retailing consultant, said the stores that have
done the best cater to consumers seeking higher-quality merchandise
``at a moderate price in a very attractive and exciting ambiance.''
He cited Limited and Gap as examples of such retailers.
   Analysts said consumers, burdened by high installment debt,
continue to be conservative and wary about more expensive purchases
like large appliances. Retailers dependent on such items have had
lackluster sales gains compared with the improvement by apparel
stores.
   Analysts predict the trend will continue until later this year.
   Several of the nation's biggest retailers _ including Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co; Wal-Mart Stores Inc.; J.C. Penney Co. Inc.; and
Woolworth Corp. _ reported their April results a week ago, and they
also reflected the split between sales of apparel and more
expensive items.
   The figures released Thursday differ from the federal
government's monthly retail sales report. Besides stores, the
government's figures include sales at a range of establishments
from auto dealerships and supermarkets to restaurants and movie
theaters.

   Here are the April domestic sales reported Thursday by some of
the nation's largest retailers.
   Due to differing calendars, many of the major companies that in
recent years issued monthly results on the first Thursday of each
month now are reporting on the second Thursday. Several big chains,
including Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., issued
their March results last week.
   Some top retailers do not report their sales monthly, including:
Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., the
Campeau Corp. units; R.H. Macy &amp; Co.; and Batus Inc. Montgomery
Ward &amp; Co., a privately held retailer, has stopped releasing its
monthly sales. Not all retailers have the same fiscal year.

<HEAD>Business Leaders Predict Slow Growth But No Recession</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's top business leaders, who
just six months ago warned that a recession was a distinct threat,
said today the economy will continue to grow moderately at least
through 1991.
   The Business Council _ 100 chief executives of the country's
largest corporations _ forecast the economy will grow at a 2
percent pace in 1990 and 2.6 percent in 1991. Last October, it had
projected growth of only 1.8 percent for this year, the slowest
pace since the recession year of 1981.
   ``There is remarkable unanimity among our consultants (who drew
up the forecast),'' said Lewis T. Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan
Inc., the giant New York bank, and council vice chairman. ``Not a
single one of the 19 is forecasting a recession to begin any time
this year or next.''
   ``The dominant belief is that the (Federal Reserve) has
successfully guided the economy into a moderate growth pattern that
has an excellent chance of being extended for a very long time,''
Preston said in presenting the forecast on the eve of the council's
semiannual meeting at the Homestead resort.
   The council's forecast last October warned that an outright
recession was possible unless the Federal Reserve cut interest
rates, which it had boosted to slow the economy in its fight
against inflation.
   Despite continuing high interest rates, the council increased
its inflation forecast to 4.8 percent from 4.2 percent for this
year because of weather factors and other ``aberrations'' that
pushed prices up 8.1 percent at an annual rate during the first
quarter.
   But the council said inflation, as measured by the government's
Consumer Price Index, will drop to 3.9 percent during the second
half of the year and average 4.4 percent during 1991. The CPI was
up 4.6 percent in 1989.
   Preston said the council's economists also expect no change in
Fed policy ``for an extended period ahead.'' He added, however,
that ``a significant reduction of the federal budget deficit would
certainly change the forecast.''
   Congressional and White House negotiators on Tuesday are to
start discussing ways to reduce the deficit for the fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1. If they fail to reach an agreement,
administration officials say the budget could be atomatically
trimmed by $60 billion to $100 billion under the Gramm-Rudman
budget-balancing law.
   That would severely hurt the economy by taking funds away from
corporations, members of the public and other beneficiaries of
government programs. It also would lead to lower tax collections,
causing the deficit to rise again, economists say.
   Today's forecast approximated the 1.9 percent consensus growth
outlook in the latest survey of 51 top economists by Blue Chip
Economic Indicators in Sedona, Ariz.
   The council projected economic growth to accelerate gradually
from 1.9 percent in the first quarter to 2.3 percent in the second
half of the year and 2.6 percent during 1991. The economy, as
measured by the gross national product, grew 3 percent in 1989
after slowing to 1.1 percent in the final quarter.
   Contributing most to the growth, the forecast said, will be
consumer spending, exports and business investments.
   The forecast also suggested an improvement in the manufacturing
sector of the economy, saying industrial production will rise 2.1
percent this year and 2.8 percent in 1991.
   On the other hand, Preston said the forecast provides little
hope that the sluggish housing industry will bounce back soon.
   ``The combination of mortgage rates ... and a very slow
appreciation of housing prices is viewed as very constraining,'' he
said.

   Nobuhiko Kawamoto, who headed Honda Motor Co.
Ltd.'s research and development for three years, has been named
president and chief executive officer of Japan's No. 3 automaker.
   Kawamoto, currently senior managing director, succeeds Tadashi
Kume, who has been at Honda's helm since October 1983 and is
retiring.
   The company said Thursday that Kawamoto, 54, will assume his new
post in seven weeks. Kume, 58, will remain on Honda's board of
directors as an adviser after his June 28 departure, it said.
   Kawamoto was president of Honda Research &amp; Development Co. Ltd.
for three years before becoming the parent company's senior
managing director in June last year.
   Kume's retirement age would be considered young if he were head
of a U.S. automaker, but Honda officials say it was not unusual for
Honda executives to retire before age 60.
   Honda is the third-largest Japanese automaker, behind Toyota
Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.
   Honda was the first Japanese company to manufacture cars in the
United States when it started production at its assembly plant in
Marysville, Ohio, in November 1982. The company since has opened
another carmaking plant in East Liberty, Ohio.
   The company also said Thursday that Shoichiro Irimajiri and
Yoshihide Munekuni will become executive vice presidents effective
June 28. Irimajiri and Munekuni have served in various jobs in
Honda's North American operations.

<TEXT>
   Aetna Casualty and Surety Co. says it
will stick with its decision to stop selling car insurance in
Pennsylvania despite a written admonition from Gov. Robert P.
Casey, who called the giant insurer ``arrogant and callous.''
   On Thursday, Casey sent a strongly worded, three-paragraph
letter to Aetna's president, David A. Kocher, criticizing the
company's decision Wednesday to terminate business with its 200,000
Pennsylvania customers.
   Casey said the company's withdrawal violated Pennsylvania law
and displayed ``an arrogant and callous disregard for our state and
your policyholders.''
   ``If you persist in your decision, I hereby put you on notice
that Pennsylvania will use all remedies against your company which
the law allows to protect the 200,000 Aetna policyholders in our
state and the broad public interest of all our citizens,'' Casey
said in the letter.
   Aetna, a Sears, Roebuck and Co. unit and the state's
fifth-largest insurer, said Pennsylvania's new car-insurance law
would cause it to lose $20 million during the next year.
   The law enacted in February lowers all motorists' rates by 10
percent July 1 or by 22 percent if they give up their rights to sue
in most cases.
   Aetna also has asked the courts to block the state Insurance
Department from trying to foil its exodus from the car-insurance
market.
   The Insurance Department filed a cease-and-desist order on
Thursday against Aetna to force it to stop sending out renewal
notices and to reinstate customers who are dropped. Aetna then
asked the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia to issue a temporary
restraining order to block the department's order.
   John C. Hawkins, an Aetna spokesman, said in a statement that
the company's action was within its rights.
   ``The company holds the position that its actions in
Pennsylvania to withdraw from the personal auto insurance market
and begin orderly non-renewal of its policyholders are legal,''
Hawkins said. ``There is nothing in Pennsylvania law that prohibits
us from taking this action.''
   At least two other companies, Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co.
and Safeco Insurance Co. of America, said they were pulling out of
the state. The Insurance Department is fighting both in court.

<HEAD>Incentives Costs Double for Ford</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites first three grafs to CLARIFY that cost of incentives

   The cost of luring car buyers into Ford Motor
Co.'s showrooms is running at an annual rate of about $4 billion,
double last year's pace, the No. 2 automaker says.
   Ford President Philip Benton said after the company's annual
meeting Thursday that the automaker hopes that incentive spending,
which chews up profits, will taper off later this year.
   If the current pace continues Ford will spend $4 billion on
rebates in 1990, he said.
   Benton said the cost of cash rebates and low-interest financing
is rising. However, the company hopes the launch of its new Escort
subcompact and Explorer sport-utility vehicle will hold down the
spending.
   ``I would be hopeful with the reception of our new cars in the
marketplace, it would be less,'' Chairman Harold Poling said at a
news conference following a quick and quiet shareholders' meeting.
   The day before, General Motors Corp. President Robert Stempel,
who takes over as chairman on Aug. 1, had the same message.
   ``The rebates have just about run out their string,'' he said.
``There's no question that the companies want to get off them.''
   Chrysler Corp., which relies heavily on incentives to boost
sales, also has said it would like to get away from them but
doesn't see that happening soon.
   Ford's meeting was the first of the Big Three this year.
Chrysler holds its annual meeting next week in Los Angeles and GM
shareholders meet a week after that in Detroit.
   Ford, like GM and Chrysler, said last week that incentive costs
were part of the reason for severely depressed first-quarter
earnings. Ford said it was spending an average of $1,000 on every
vehicle it sells now.
   The company earned $506.2 million during the first three months
of this year, down 69 percent from last year's company-record
first-quarter earnings. GM's quarterly earnings fell 54 percent and
Chrysler's dropped 80 percent.
   ``We believe the increased marketing and product expenditures
will continue to affect profits throughout the year,'' Poling told
shareholders in the first annual meeting he has run. He succeeded
Donald Petersen as chairman March 1.
   If incentives work, they boost a company's sales pace. But they
cut directly into profits. Ford's share of the U.S. market for
domestically built cars was 28.6 percent at the end of April,
compared with GM's 46 percent and Chrysler's 11 percent.
   Also at Ford's annual meeting:
   _Benton said Ford spent about $1.2 billion on its worldwide
advertising in 1989, about 9 percent more than it spent in the
previous year.
   _A 17-member slate of directors nominated by the board was
elected unopposed.
   _Executives fielded repeated questions about the location of
next year's annual meeting. Ford Auditorium, where the company has
held 27 shareholder meetings, will be torn down to make way for a
bank office building if a proposal before the Detroit City Council
is approved.
   Poling said the board would decide on a meeting site later.

   Retail sales slumped 0.6 percent in April,
posting the second consecutive monthly decline and the biggest
setback in six months, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said sales fell by $907 million last
month to a seasonally adjusted $148.64 billion.
   The April decrease was a disappointment to economists, who had
been looking for a small rebound following a 0.2 percent decline in
March and no change in February.
   Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total
economic activity, continued weakness in the area of retail sales
was likely to intensify concerns about the country's future
economic prospects, especially in light of last week's report that
unemployment climbed in April to 5.4 percent.
   Growing joblessness could promote worries among consumers about
the future, causing them to shut off spending, especially for
big-ticket items such as autos.
   The 0.6 percent April decline was the largest since a 1.4
percent plunge last October.
   The back-to-back declines in March and April marked the first
time that has occurred in moe than three years.
   Originally, the government reported February posted a sales
decline as well but sales activity during that month was revised
upward in the current report to show no change.
   For April, the biggest drag on activity came from auto sales,
which dropped 2.7 percent. It marked the sixth time in the last
seven months that car sales have fallen.
   Without the big drop in auto sales, total retail sales would
have been unchanged last month.
   Sales at general department stores were off 0.7 percent in April
following an even bigger 1.2 percent drop in March. A survey
focusing only on the country's largest chain department stores
showed sales had generally rebounded in April, when compared to a
year ago, boosted by late Easter shopping.
   Sales at hardware and building supply stores dropped 2.6 percent
in April following an 0.8 percent decrease the previous month.
   There was basic weakness across the board. Sales at gasoline
stations fell by 1 percent, restaurant sales were off by 0.2
percent while sales at speciality clothing stores were down 1.9
percent.
   Drug stores were the only retail establishments showing an
increase, a gain of 1.2 percent.

   Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and home products
giant, reported Friday that its first quarter net income rose 13
percent over a year ago as growth in Europe countered declining
profitability in North America.
   The company said its net profit for the three months ended March
31 totaled $362 million, or 82 cents a share, compared with $321
million, or 72 cents, in 1989.
   Sales rose around 13 percent to $8.4 billion from $7.4 billion.
   Chairman Sir Michael Angus called the profit improvement
``satisfactory.''
   On a regional level, operations in Europe were strong across the
board, Unilever said. North America, however, saw lower profit in
the food business, the company said.
   In other regions around the world, profit grew strongly, it said.
   The company provided the dollar figures.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit Xerox
Corp. filed against Apple Computer Inc. after Xerox gave up its one
remaining claim in the suit, which centered on rights to the
popular display technology in the Macintosh computer.
   Xerox's decision will allow the company to appeal the case more
quickly.
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker dismissed the suit Wednesday.
   The lawsuit, which was filed in December, focused on technology
known as a graphical user interface, which makes computers easier
to use by replacing typed commands with pictures called icons on
the screen and a pointer device called a mouse.
   The technology helped sell millions of Macintoshes and forced
other manufacturers to offer similar systems for desktop computers.
   Xerox maintained that many features in the Macintosh originated
at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, about 30 miles south of San
Francisco, in the 1970s. The suit sought $150 million in damages
and asked to have Apple's copyrights on the Macintosh display
technology cancelled.
   On March 23, Walker dismissed five of Xerox's six counts against
Apple on procedural grounds. The remaining count sought a
declaratory judgement stating that Xerox owns the copyright to its
Star program, one of those it accused Apple of pirating.
   Xerox said it intends to appeal the dismissal.

   The stock market ran up a broad gain in
stepped-up trading today, spurred on by favorable inflation news
and falling interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 13.97 to
2,752.48 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 4 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 822 up, 212
down and 427 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 34.88 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The government reported this morning that the producer price
index of finished goods dropped 0.3 percent in April, in contrast
to Wall Street's expectations of a 0.1 percent-0.3 percent increase.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.6
percent last month.
   Analysts said the figures provided the markets with a double
dose of evidence that the pace of the economy remained slow and
inflationary pressures were subdued.
   That served to allay whatever fears persisted on Wall Street
that the Federal Reserve might move soon to tighten credit.
Interest rates fell in the bond and short-term money markets.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Merck rose | to 76\;
International Business Machines 1&lsqb; to 113{; Philip Morris \ to 43|;

value index was up 1.07 at 349.99.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.63 to

   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 on the

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. has filed
suit in federal court against 22 Philadelphia stores, claiming the
retailers broke copyright law by selling products depicting its
popular television series ``The Simpsons.''
   The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, alleges the
stores have illegally sold hundreds of counterfeit Simpsons
merchandise.
   The animated show airs on the company's subsidiary, Fox
Broadcasting Co.
   More than 50 additional businesses eventually could be named as
defendants, according to an attorney for Fox, Zachary T. Wobensmith
III.
   ``The only thing I can tell you is that Twentieth Century Fox is
going to enforce its copyrights and prosecute anyone who is
selling, distributing or manufacturing unlicensed Simpsons items,''
he said.
   Similar suits have been filed in Washington and Dallas, he said.
   ``The Simpsons'' was created in 1987 for use as 60-second
segments in another Fox program, ``The Tracey Ullman Show.'' The
cartoon then became a half-hour show in January and appears weekly
on Fox television affiliates.

willing to discuss everything at next week's budget summit but
declared ``I'm not going to show you my hand'' in advance on new
taxes.
   Bush, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way from
Washington to Texas, insisted that nothing was off the bargaining
table, despite comments from a senior aide suggesting he might rule
out any proposed tax increase.
   ``Why don't you just listen to what I say and see what we do,''
Bush said. ``There are no conditions and that's the way it is,
that's the way it's going to be and that's the way it must be.''
   It was the first time Bush himself has spoken out on the subject
since he appeared to open the door to a possible tax increase last
Sunday by proposing a no-preconditions budget summit with Congress.
   The first negotiations will take place next Tuesday at the White
House.
   Bush's comments came as administration and congressional leaders
struggled to impose a verbal cease-fire on Democrats and
Republicans who are bickering over whether next week's budget
summit will consider new taxes.
   Top Democrats criticized White House Chief of Staf John Sununu
for saying that Bush would never accept tax increases as part of a
$1.2 trillion budget for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   Asked if Sununu was in trouble for his remarks, Bush said:
``That's silly _ so stupid.''
   And, in a reference to members of Congress who have joined in
the fray, Bush said: ``None of these congressmen are in trouble,
either.''
   However, the president conceded that House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash, was concerned over Sununu's remarks. Bush called
Foley on Thursday to assure him that he had no preconditions for
the budget summit talks.
   ``Yes, he did express concern,'' Bush said. ``But I think he
sees the need to go forward on the basis I have called for and I
respect him for that.''
   Pressed on whether he would consider tax increases if they were
put on the table, Bush said: ``You can come at me all day long. It
would not be dealing in good faith if I started going into these
details. I'm not going to do it.''
   ``I'm not going to show you my hand and I haven't seen a lot of
hands being laid down up on the Hill,'' Bush said. ``But that's the
way it ought to be. There are some tough decisions out there and
we've got to do something.''
   Still, Bush declined to characterize the widening deficit gap as
a crisis. ``No, we're not dealing in a crisis mentality,'' he said.
``But, we've got a major deficit problem. ... We need cooperation
because it isn't going to be easy; it's going to be very
difficult.''
   Could the budget be balanced without some form of tax hike?
``See what happens,'' the president said. ``We just go there and
discuss everything. ...That's the only way you can get
strong-willed people to the table _ in good faith, the way it will
be.''
   Bush spoke on his way to a Texas, where he was to deliver a
commencement address at Texas A&amp;I University at Kingsville.
   Although Democrats reacted angrily Thursday to Sununu's remarks,
they stopped short of any action that could imperil the top-level
bargaining, which is supposed to have no preconditions and is set
to begin Tuesday.
   ``We view this incident as an extremely serious one because it
could, if repeated, threaten the success of these talks,'' Foley
said on Thursday.
   Acknowledging the intense political pressure ignited by a need
for perhaps $100 billion in budget cuts next year, lawmakers of
both parties begged for a truce.
   ``One way to make certain we don't succeed is to continue
statements that might throw us off course,'' said Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   ``We just can't continue to have this kind of sniping and
political warfare going on at the same time we're trying to deal
with a serious problem,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta, D-Calif.
   Sununu said his controversial comments were ``designed to make
sure that people did not misinterpret `no conditions' as implying
that there was a condition for what had to be in the final
agreement.''
   White House budget chief Richard Darman has told lawmakers that
there could be a need to slash next year's federal shortfall by $60
billion to $100 billion, an astronomical amount even by government
standards. The goal is to obey the Gramm-Rudman law's requirement
that the 1991 budget gap not exceed $64 billion.

   A second steep drop in vegetable costs helped
push wholesale prices down 0.3 percent overall in April, the
government said today.
   It was the sharpest decline since August and the third
consecutive moderate report after a severe cold snap sent prices
spiraling 1.8 percent in January, a 15-year record.
   The Labor Department's Producer Price Index for finished goods,
one stop short of retail, had fallen 0.2 percent in March and
showed no change in February. The monthly numbers are all adjusted
for seasonal variations.
   For the first four months of the year, wholesale inflation was
running at a 4.2 percent annual rate, down from 4.8 percent for all
of 1989.
   In a separate report today, the Commerce Department said retail
sales last month slumped 0.6 percent, the third consecutive month
without an increase.
   Stock and bond markets rallied in response to both reports.
Traders took them as a sign that the Federal Reserve Board, in the
near term, would not need to push up interest rates to fight
inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbed 13.97 to
2,752.48 in the first half hour of trading.
   ``The numbers are increasingly ratifying the fact that we've
dodged the inflationary bullet, at least for a while,'' said Dirk
Van Dongen, president of the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors. ``The bad news is that maybe the soft
landing (economic slowdown) is a little softer than we would like.''
   In April, food prices fell 0.6 percent after an identical 0.6
percent decline a month earlier. Prices rose for eggs, rice, pasta
and pork. They fell for fruit, chicken, cooking oils and candy.
   Vegetable prices, which fell 25.5 percent in March after record
increases the previous two months, fell another 31.1 percent last
month. It was the biggest drop since the government began tracking
those costs in 1967. Tomato prices fell 73.3 percent.
   ``They are no longer boxing tomatoes in Florida because the
boxes are worth more than the tomatoes. ... Thus the winter freeze
is nothing more ... than a bad memory,'' said economist Donald
Ratajczak of Georgia State University.
   Energy prices dropped 1.7 percent after declining the two
previous months. Gasoline prices, with the start of the warm
weather driving season, climbed 2.2 percent. However fuel oil fell
1.9 percent while natural gas dropped 5.5 percent.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose a
modest 0.2 percent after rising a moderate 0.3 percent in March.
Economists said this ``core'' number is often a better indicator of
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy.
   Automobile prices fell 0.9 percent in April. Clothing price
inflation recovered from increases a month earlier. Women's, men's
and boys' clothing costs were unchanged. Girls' and infants'
clothing fell 0.2 percent.
   Prices rose for medicines, soap, floor coverings and toys. They
fell for alcoholic beverages, jewelry and magazines.
   The various changes put the index for all finished goods at
117.0 in April. That means a hypothetical selection of goods that
cost $100 in 1982 cost $117 last month, up from $113 a year earlier.
   Price pressures in earlier stages of the production process were
moderate in April. Intermediate goods rose a slight 0.1 percent
while crude goods fell 3.1 percent. An example of the three
processing stages would be bread for finished goods, flour for
intermediate and wheat for crude.
   Despite the moderate report for April prices at the wholesale
level, economists are still concerned that inflation may be
accelerating this year.
   Consumer prices, up at an annual rate of 8.5 percent in the
first quarter, are rising at a steeper pace than wholesale costs.
April consumer numbers are due out next week.
   Why the divergence between the two sets of prices?
   Producer prices reflect only the cost of goods, while consumer
prices are heavily influenced by the cost of services, which have
been less affected by the economic slowdown of recent months.
   Economic growth has slowed enough to soften demand and hold down
goods prices, but not enough to greatly affect employment and thus
the cost of services.
   The Federal Reserve Board, which aims its monetary policy at
reducing inflation, meets Tuesday to consider interest rate policy
for the next six weeks.
   With April wholesale inflation much better than the 0.2 percent
rise forecast by most economists, the Fed may be less inclined to
cool the economy by nudging interest rates higher, something it
hasn't done since March 1989.
   However, financial markets in recent weeks had nevertheless
anticipated Fed tightening by pushing up rates outside the central
bank's direct control. In the government's quarterly auction of
three-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds this week, interest
rates were up about a third of a percentage point from three months
ago.

   The stock market chalked up a broad gain today,
spurred on by favorable inflation news and falling interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 11.94 to
2,750.45 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 877 up, 361
down and 487 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 64.81 million shares at
midmorning.
   The government reported this morning that the producer price
index of finished goods dropped 0.3 percent in April, in contrast
to Wall Street's expectations of a 0.1 percent-0.3 percent increase.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.6
percent last month.
   Analysts said the figures provided the markets with a double
dose of evidence that the pace of the economy remained slow and
inflationary pressures were subdued.
   That served to allay whatever fears persisted on Wall Street
that the Federal Reserve might move soon to tighten credit.
Interest rates fell in the bond and short-term money markets.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Eli Lilly rose 1&lsqb; to 70};
International Business Machines ~ to 113\; Philip Morris &rsqb; to 43},
and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph &rsqb; to 41|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.03 to 189.17. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.22 at 350.14.

   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Trading is expected to be heavily influenced by the release
Thursday of the Agriculture Department's crop report.
   The U.S.D.A. estimated winter wheat production at a nine-year
high of 2.09 billion bushels. That is up 44 percent from last
year's drought-reduced harvest of 1.45 billion bushels.
   This year's corn harvest was projected at 8.1 billion bushels
and soybean production was pegged at 1.92 billion bushels.
   Analysts say the figures for wheat and soybeans are considered
bearish, although soyoil interest could give some strength to the
soybean complex.
   Corn is getting some support from commission house buying.
   In early trading, wheat was a { cent to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.81{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents
to 3 cents higher with May at $2.91 a bushel; oats were 1 cent
lower to a \ cent higher with May at $1.64{ a bushel; soybeans were
1 cent to 2{ cents higher with May at $6.49 a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed and pork futures lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures were pressured by indications cash market prices
have peaked and could turn lower.
   Pork price were hammered by aggressive selling of pork belly
futures in followthrough to Thursday's weak close.
   Live cattle were .08 cent lower to .35 cent higher with June at
74.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .30 cent
higher with May at 84.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .62 cent
lower to .25 cent higher with June at 63.30 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.55 cent lower to .08 cent higher with May at
64.50 cents a pound.
   Livestock and pork futures settled lower in Thursday's trading.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple of decades after they first caught on
in the world of professional money management, index funds are
bidding to win a new generation of converts among individual
investors.
   The recruitment drive is being led by such prominent mutual-fund
sponsors as Dreyfus Corp. and Fidelity Investments, which lately
have introduced funds based on stock-market indexes.
   Vanguard Group, a singular early success in the field with its
Index Trust-500 Portfolio, is extending the idea to a series of new
fund offerings.
   At the very least ``a mini-fad is developing,'' says Sheldon
Jacobs, publisher of the monthly newsletter No-Load Fund Investor
in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.
   If the strategy proves as popular with the public as it has
among managers of pension funds and other institutional pools of
money, it could turn out to be substantially more than a fad.
   Index funds are set up to duplicate the performance of some
popular market yardstick such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
composite index, by holding a portfolio of issues that closely
matches the makeup of the index.
   This often strikes those who first encounter the concept as
``playing for a tie'' rather than shooting for all-out victory in
the battle for investment profits.
   Indeed, indexing has never had a big fan club among securities
analysts, economists and market forecasters, who compete to
outguess each other. After all, the theory behind it pretty much
dismisses their work as a waste of time and money.
   Regardless of who is right in this academic debate, however,
indexed money-management strategies do appear to have benefited
from the makeup of the modern marketplace.
   When institutions, by virtue of their increasingly dominant
role, in effect become synonymous with the market, it stands to
reason that they cannot as a group outperform that market.
   Also, says Jacobs, ``over the long run the costs of investing
can offset managerial skill.'' Index funds gain an edge by
minimizing or eliminating the costs of research and frequent
trading.
   The Vanguard 500 Portfolio, which was started in 1976, has
attracted assets approaching $2 billion. Even in today's $1
trillion fund industry, any fund over $1 billion still ranks as a
big success.
   Whether you count the 500 Portfolio as a ``growth'' or ``growth
and income'' fund, Jacobs says, its 16.5 percent average annual
return over the past five years is good enough to rank it among the
top 20 percent of its class.
   Damning as it may look to the managed competition, that showing
may exaggerate the virtues of indexing to some degree.
   The big stocks that make up the S&amp;P 500 have been outpacing
their smaller counterparts in recent years, Jacobs notes, in part
because of their popularity among foreign investors and because of
the spreading use of indexing itself.
   Whether the blue-chip 500 will stay at the head of the pack in
the 1990s remains an open question. Some analysts say smaller,
secondary stocks _ some of which are now being grouped into new,
specialized index funds _ are due for a comeback.
   ``While the odds favor a change in market leadership, it is very
difficult to say just when this will occur,'' Jacobs observes.
   To investors shopping for an index-fund investment, Jacobs
offers a couple of suggestions. First of all, he says, pay special
attention to all costs, including management fees, operating
expenses and any entrance or exit charges.
   ``The whole point of index fund investing is to minimize
expenses,'' he says.
   Secondly, he recommends spreading your money among funds based
on indexes of both large and small stocks. ``That way,'' he
concludes, ``you really will be guaranteed a `market' return.''

   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. Chairman
William R. Laidig, who led the paper company's unsuccessful effort
to fend off Georgia-Pacific Corp., left the company Friday with a
lucrative severance package.
   A company spokesman said Laidig will qualify for a ``golden
parachute'' package that will pay him three times his base salary
plus his highest annual bonus of the past three years.
   The company's 1989 proxy statement listed Laidig's salary at
$707,000 a year.
   The board sweetened the severance package after Georgia-Pacific
launched a hostile takeover bid last fall. Great Northern's
four-month effort to remain independent ended in February, when the
company agreed to be acquired by Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific for
$3.7 billion.
   Laidig's departure comes about a month before the companies are
expected to merge.
   In a letter to employees, Laidig said ``he agreed to help during
the transition and had done that to the point it was most
productive,'' Great Northern spokesman Stephen M. Hill said.
   Laidig, who had served as chairman, chief executive and
president of Great Northern since 1984, was said to be in a meeting
early Friday and unavailable for comment.

<TEXT>
   The National Association of Securities
Dealers has fined Stuart-James Co. more than $2 million for
overcharging companies, one of the largest fines ever levied
against a brokerage firm by NASD.
   The alleged overcharges involved more than 4,000 stock
transactions in 1988, said NASD, which policies over-the-counter
stock markets.
   Stuart-James is one of the nation's largest over-the-counter
investment banking firms with 40 retail offices nationwide and over
1,000 brokers.
   NASD announced Thursday that as part of its settlement with the
Englewood-based brokerage, NASD was fining Stuart-James $1.9
million; its president and owner James Padgett $105,000; its former
chairman and co-owner Stuart Graff $25,000, and its head trader,
Steven Pata, $30,000.
   Padget also was barred from being involved in a supervisory
capacity in the company's markup area for six months, and Graff was
suspended from acting as the company's principal for 60 days under
the agreement. NASD also suspended Pata for 20 days. The parties
agreed to the sanctions without admitting or denying guilt.
   NASD said the Stuart-James markups ranged from 6.9 percent to
153 percent over their cost, when the firm dominated and controlled
the trading of the securities.
   In the settlement announced Thursday, the company and its
officials consented to findings that NASD rules were violated in
markups charged customers in four low-priced securities: Meadow
Group Inc., a NASDAQ stock exchange-listed security, and three
penny stocks _ Celerity Coputing Inc; 1992 warrants for
International Design Group Inc., and National DataComputer Inc.
   As part of the settlement, Stuart-James also agreed to change
certain business practices, some of which the company dropped more
than a year ago.
   For instance, it agreed to stop making markets in penny stocks
and to send customers written confirmation of the highest ask and
bid prices in certain securities at the time of sale.
   The settlement also calls for an independent consultant to
review the firm's trading practices and procedures, to prepare
reports and to make recommendations to both the brokerage and NASD.
   Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed
excessive markup charges against the firm and also accused it of a
number of other securities violations.
   Stuart-James, Padgett, Graff and other current and former
executives of the firm now are on trial before an SEC
administrative law judge.

<HEAD>British Inflation Rate Up to 9.4 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's annual inflation rate reached an
eight-year high of 9.4 percent in April, the government reported
Friday.
   But the financial markets took the news well, with the pound and
stock prices both firming, since many investors had expected an
even higher 9.7 percent rate.
   Fighting inflation is Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's No. 1
economic priority and her Conservative government has increased
interest rates to 15 percent to try an slow down demand.
   However, a new per-capita tax, increases in excise duties and
higher utility charges combined to push the inflation rate to its
highest level since May 1982 when it stood at 9.5 percent, the
Central Statistical Office said.
   In March, the rate stood at 8.1 percent.
   The office said its retail price index rose 3 percent in April
from March. The monthly rise was the largest since April 1980 when
the index gained 3.4 percent.
   The index, which uses a January 1987 base of 100, stood at 125.1
in April, 121.4 in March, and 114.3 in April 1989.
   ``Everyone was sure it was going to double figures,'' said a
trader at a major British bank, speaking anonymously. ``Now people
are going to say, `that's not too bad.'''
   The Bank of England on Thursday forecast inflation at about 10
percent for the near-term, with a peak in the third quarter.
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major said there was
``nothing unexpected'' in the latest rise. Speaking in broadcast
interviews after the figures were released, Major said the increase
resulted directly from ``relatively artificial changes.''

   Share prices finished higher Friday on London's

British inflation figures.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up
18.9 points at 2,175.9. That was well above its session low of
2,155.6 and slightly off from a peak of 2,182.3.
   Volume totaled 510.1 million shares, up from 406.3 million
Thursday.
   Shares began climbing after the release of the British inflation
figures, which showed that the annual inflation rate rose to 9.4
percent in April, up from 8.1 percent in March but below the
markets expectations.
   ``Anything less than 10 percent was going to rally the market,''
a market maker said.

   The U.S. dollar fell sharply against most major
foreign currencies in lively European trading today. Gold prices
were also lower.
   Dealers said the dollar's acute weakness began earlier in Asia
and continued throughout the European day. Traders said they could
find no reason for the dollar's drop.
   ``It's something we can find no explanation for,'' said a trader
at a large U.S. bank in London. The dollar ``has never moved so
much (against the yen) in recent times. It set a negative tone for
the rest of the day.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 154.15 Japanese yen from
156.75 yen on Thursday. Later in London, it fell further to 153.75
yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6817 from $1.6770 late
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's

<HEAD>The Money Is Plentiful Where The Rates Are High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While banks in some areas might be pruning their
lists of qualified borrowers, they are still shoveling out the
money on credit cards.
   The latest Federal Reserve figures show that revolving credit,
most of it run up at retail stores and through bank cards, rose at
a 12.1 percent annual rate in March, a rather large figure for a
sluggish economy.
   That increase means that in the first quarter of this year the
amount of consumer debt outstanding was $706 billion, or roughly
$24 billion more than existed a year earlier.
   Most of this credit, it is presumed, went to pay for new
consumer items, although some cynics will tell you that a good many
Americans these days have become accustomed to meeting ordinary
expenses through borrowing.
   Meanwhile, business loans _ so-called commercial and industrial
loans _ have been slowing. In the first 14 weeks of 1988, C&amp;I loans
rose $10.1 billion. In the same period of 1989, they rose $12
billion. In 1990, they rose just $5.4 billion.
   The Federal Reserve and other federal regulators leave no
misimpressions about their goal, which is to keep the economy cool
and collected. That is to say they seek to avoid inflation, avoid
recession and get the bills paid.
   Because of this policy, the Fed concedes there are pockets of
tight money, a rather odd turn of phrase for what are, in effect,
empty pockets. But it declines to say that a general credit crunch
exists.
   Nevertheless, complaints are rising in some areas from small
businesses, especially developers, who claim their lines of credit
are being withdrawn or reduced. Home mortgage applications also are
being scrutinized more closely.
   While there might or might not be a credit crunch, the situation
obviously concerns the Fed, which last week advised bankers to act
like bankers, that is, to assume prudent risks rather than attempt
to reduce risk to zero.
   Meanwhile, those bank cards seem to be an exception to the new
conservatism of lenders. Banks continue to expand their bank card
lists. And credit limits for customers who pay on time may even be
raised, no questions asked.
   The explanation isn't complex: Bank cards are profitable.
   The major reason is that interest charges are often double those
of home equity loans. When some home mortgages are in single
digits, for example, many bank card rates are 19.5 percent, plus an
annual fee.
   Moreover, while the total amount of credit extended on bank
cards might be sizeable for any particular bank, the separate loans
are relatively small. The bank's exposure on any one loan is
limited.
   In contrast, a home equity loan can be large. Millions of
Americans own homes that have doubled in value in the past decade
or less, and they are tempted to use that equity. Home equity loans
are the least expensive, and the expense is made still lower at tax
time, when interest paid can be deducted.
   In lending to small businesses, meanwhile, bankers are
confronted with this situation: Small-business loans often are
risky; that risk is made even more so when the economy is sluggish;
many such loans have gone bad in recent years.
   Confronted with regulatory restraints, poor business conditions
and recent bad experience on loans to small businesses, many
bankers seem to be retreating to the security, the limited risk and
the high returns of bank card credit.

<HEAD>What the Dollar's Slide Means</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Dollar-Gold Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest slide in dollar reflects a rebound in the value of
the Japanese yen and a spreading belief that the U.S. economy is
not overheating.
   A slower economy would mean lower interest rates, which reduces
the dollar's allure to international investors.
   The dollar's value also is falling because of eased fears about
a credit crunch affecting banks.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Yen Surge</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   The yen surged in value against the dollar in foreign exchange
trading Friday after a long slide. Traders who buy and sell
currencies for a profit said the yen had been oversold in the wake
of this spring's decline in the Tokyo stock market.
   Traders were said to be looking for excuses to buy yen and sell
dollars.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Economy</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   U.S. economic reports are providing the needed excuse. Recent
statistics have reported slumping home sales, rising unemployment
and weak corporate profits. On Friday, economic reports showed a
slowdown in retail sales and a drop in wholesale prices.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Interest Rates</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   A drop in interest rates would encourage borrowing, but also
would make the dollar less attractive because investments
denominated in dollars won't earn as much as before.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Impact</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   The dollar's value is the most visible symbol of confidence in
the health of the U.S. economy. The dollar's worth relative to
other currencies also is an important barometer of international
economic currents.
   While short-term rises or drops in the dollar's worth don't
necessarily signal profound economic changes, they are nonetheless
monitored closely by economists and governments.
   Over the longer term, a weaker dollar is thought to help U.S.
trade by making exports relatively less expensive, and therefore
more competitive, in world markets.

   The stock market swept ahead today, spurred on
by favorable inflation news and falling interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 52.26 to
2,790.77 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,147 up,
328 down and 444 unchanged.
   The Dow's gain carried to to within striking distance of the
record closing high of 2,810.15 it reached on Jan. 2 of this year.
   The government reported this morning that the producer price
index of finished goods dropped 0.3 percent in April, in contrast
to Wall Street's expectations of a 0.1 percent-0.3 percent increase.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.6
percent last month.
   Analysts said the figures provided the markets with a double
dose of evidence that the pace of the economy remained slow and
inflationary pressures were subdued.
   That served to allay whatever fears persisted on Wall Street
that the Federal Reserve might move soon to tighten credit.
Interest rates fell in the bond and short-term money markets.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of top U.S. businesses said
Friday the economy will grow only moderately this year and next but
will manage to stave off a recession.
   Inflation is on the way down, they say, predicting that the
first-quarter annual inflation rate of 8.1 percent will be cut
nearly in half.
   Economic growth will total about 2 percent in 1990 as it
accelerates gradually from 1.9 percent in the first half of the
year to 2.3 percent in the second, according to the Business
Council, 100 chief executives of the nation's largest corporations.
It will rise to 2.6 percent in 1991.
   The Bush administration forecast in January that the economy
would grow 2.4 percent in 1990, although many economists expect
that to be lowered in the July review. It projects 3.2 percent
growth in 1991.
   The council's latest forecast, presented at its semiannual
meeting at this mountain resort, contrasted with a report released
at its October meeting that predicted a meager 1.8 percent growth
rate in 1990 and warned of an outright recession if the Federal
Reserve failed to cut interest rates.
   The Fed, which had boosted rates to slow the economy in its
fight against inflation, did permit rates to drop several times
after the October meeting. But it has kept a firm hand on credit
since December despite calls for easing by administration officials
and some economists to allow stronger economic growth.
   Lewis T. Preston, Business Council vice chairman and chairman of
J.P. Morgan Inc., the giant New York bank, said the 19 council
economists who drew up the report expected no change in Fed policy
``for an extended period of ahead.''
   Nevertheless, Preston said ``not a single one of the 19 is
forecasting a recession to begin any time this year or next.''
   ``The dominant belief is that the Fed has successfully guided
the economy into a moderate growth pattern that has an excellent
chance of being extended for a very long time,'' Preston told
reporters.
   The Business Council forecast mirrored the 2 percent consensus
growth rate in a May survey of 51 leading economists by Blue Chip
Economic Indicators in Sedona, Ariz.
   The economy grew 3 percent last year, but had slowed to 1.1
percent rate during the fourth quarter. It grew at a 1.9 percent
clip in the first quarter of 1990.
   Looking at the steep price increases early this year, the
council said ``the disappointingly high inflation readings in the
first quarter are generally viewed as an aberration by the
consultants.'' They now expect the 8.1 percent annual rate in the
first quarter to slow to 3.3 percent in the second.
   ``The group's CPI inflation forecast for the second half of the
year has been slightly lowered from 4.1 percent at the time of the
last survey to 3.9 percent in the current survey,'' the council
said.
   Despite the slowdown, inflation for the full year is projected
to be 4.8 percent. That's up from a 4.2 percent rate the council
forecast in October.
   Inflation should moderate next year to a rate of 4.4 percent,
the council said.
   The adminstration's January forecast calls for inflation to rise
3.9 percent this year and 4 percent in 1991. It was 4.6 percent in
1989.
   Preston said the economy is fragile and the growth forecast
could be skewed by special factors and by federal deficit-reduction
talks beginning Tuesday between congressional and White House
negotiators.
   The administration contends that if the deficit is not cut to
the $64 billion limit set by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law,
it could mean automatic spending cuts of between $60 billion and
$100 billion in fiscal 1991 that begins Oct. 1.
   Such huge cuts would severely hurt the economy, economists say.
   Nevertheless, the council is forecasting 1990 growth based on
continued consumer spending, exports and business investment.
   It also said the manufacturing sector would pick up, with
industrial production rising 2.1 percent this year and 2.8 percent
during 1991. The optimism didn't extend to housing, however.
   ``Our advisory group has little hope that housing will show any
buoyancy any time soon,'' Preston said. ``The combination of
mortgage rates ... and a very slow appreciation of housing prices
is viewed as very constraining.''

<HEAD>Perrier's Profit Plunges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Source Perrier SA said Friday that the costs
associated with the recent recall of its popular bottled sparkling
water were assessed to last year's account, resulting in a 75
percent plunge in earnings for 1989.
   The company said net profit totaled $47 million for the year,
compared with $185 million in 1988.
   Perrier recalled its bottled water worldwide in February after
tests showed traces of benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, in its
product in several countries. The contamination came from improper
infiltration of carbon dioxide gas added to the water, according to
the company.
   Perrier put the cost of the recall at $78 million.
   The company said it put aside part of its 1989 profit to cover
the recall expense, which is permitted under French law.
   Perrier said it had expected to cover most of the recall costs
with non-recurring gains from the sale of assets, but these totaled
only $45 million for 1989.
   In addition, Perrier's 1988 results were swelled by much more
substantial non-recurring gains of $154 million, reflecting the
sale of assets that included television, confectionary and milk
interests.
   Perrier recently began resupplying its distributorss with
bottles marked ``New Production.''
   Perrier officials said they were optimistic about 1990 results.
   ``Perrier is again present on all markets and the current pace
of production should allow us to meet the enormous worldwide demand
for Perrier relatively quickly,'' the company said in a statement.
   It said sales of mineral water were up 12 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, but didn't provide a specific figure.

<HEAD>Printer's Mistake Makes Trips to Germany a Bargain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of central Florida newspaper readers
knew they spotted a bargain when they saw the Pan Am ad offering a
one-way flight to Nuremberg, West Germany, for $109.
   Oops. The advertisement should have said $409.
   But never mind, Pan Am went ahead and honored the erroneously
advertised price for about 75 people who wanted tickets Wednesday
and Thursday.
   After all, the ad promised ``A lot of Europe for not a lot of
money.''
   Pan Am ticket agents discovered the error Wednesday morning when
the first bargain hunters appeared.
   ``It was very embarrassing,'' said Fergus Kelly, Pan Am's
general manager in Orlando. ``We said, `That'll be $409,' and the
customer said, `Uh-uh.'''
   The deal on the fare, made possible by the mistake of a New York
printing company, ended at noon Thursday. Company officials said
the error appeared only in the ad that ran in The Orlando Sentinel.
   At the local office of the law firm of Holland &amp; Knight,
secretary Julie McDaniels' husband Dave called her Wednesday to
tell her about the fare and ask her if she wanted to go to Germany.
She thought about it ``for about two seconds,'' she said.
   Mrs. McDaniels asked her boss for the time off. Her boss asked
about the fare.
   ``When I told him, he jumped for it,'' she said. ``My boss is
going too.''
   Officials at Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Affairs said the company wasn't under any legal obligation to honor
the lower fare since it was a typographical error.
   But Pamela Hanlon, a New York spokeswoman for Pan Am, said
Friday the airline decided it was only fair to do so, particularly
since it won't be out any money.
   ``The printers ... have acknowledged it was their error and will
pick up the cost to Pan Am,'' Ms. Hanlon said.

<HEAD>Flight Attendants Sue American Airlines Over Who Gets Eastern Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The union representing American
Airlines' flight attendants has filed suit over the company's plan
to use foreign nationals on Latin American routes newly acquired
from Eastern Airlines.
   In a lawsuit filed Thursday in Miami, the Association of
Professional Flight Attendants claims the plan violates American's
contract with the 14,500-member union.
   Earlier this week, American asked a Fort Worth federal judge to
rule that the Railway Labor Act does not apply to flight attendants
outside the United States and international flights to and from
U.S. gateway cities.
   American, the nation's largest airline, has agreed to pay
Eastern $335 million for its routes between Miami and 15 Latin
American nations. The sale is a key part of Eastern's
reorganization plan.
   American plans to hire all of Eastern's employees outside the
United States, including flight attendants who are not U.S.
citizens and who apparently will not be members of the airline's
independent flight attendants' union.
   The union also sought a preliminary injunction barring American
from going ahead with its plans until the matter is put to
arbitration. The Fort Worth-based airline is to begin serving some
of the routes by July 1 and to serve them all by late August.
   ``What is at stake here is not only international flying in and
out of Latin America to U.S. cities such as Miami, but
international flying throughout the world,'' said Cheryle Leon,
president of the flight attendants union.
   Ms. Leon said the union had made an offer that would have
allowed American to employ temporarily the foreign flight
attendants coming from Eastern, but American rejected the offer.
   Maureen Moore, an American attorney, said the airline has no
choice but to hire those Latin American attendants now flying with
Eastern because it agreed to do so as part of the acquisition.
   Eastern had been held to the same obligation when it acquired
those routes from the old Braniff International Airways in 1982,
shortly before Braniff filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition and
ceased operating for nearly two years.
   Ms. Moore said the flight attendants' union does not have a
clause in its contract defining the extent of union coverage. And
since American contends that the Railway Labor Act does not apply
outside the United States, the airline believes the APFA has no
right to represent citizens of foreign nations who work only on
American international flights.
   ``Besides, some of these people are in their own unions,'' Ms.
Moore said.

<HEAD>Ames Asks Creditors for Help in Stocking Shelves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKY HILL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new head of Ames Department Stores
Inc. has appealed to creditors to help the discount retail chain
restock its shelves, especially in time for back-to-school sales at
the end of summer.
   Nearly 400 of the company's creditors gathered Thursday in New
York to discuss Ames' Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and how the
company plans to dig out of its problems.
   Stephen L. Pistner, Ames' new chief executive officer, had
little to say about the decisions that led the 680-store retailer
into U.S. Bankruptcy Court last month. But he asked for cooperation.
   ``I expect no favoritism from you, but I expect your honest
effort to get us back in business quickly,'' he said.
   Ames has sought protection from creditors while it files a plan
to reorganize. Thursday's meeting was called by the U.S. Trustee's
office, an arm of the bankruptcy court, to choose a committee of
creditors to participate in the case.
   Michael Cook, a bankruptcy attorney representing Ames, said the
company owes an estimated $528 million to 33 banks, $355 million to
bondholders and an estimated $350 million to suppliers.
   Antonio Alvarez, a financial consultant, said the company has
$45 million in cash available. Ames also has received court
approval to borrow $25 million from Chemical Bank in New York.
   Chemical has agreed to lend Ames up to $250 million. A hearing
to approve that financing is scheduled for next Tuesday in New
York, Alvarez said.
   Pistner said Ames intends to use the money to restock its
stores. Company President George Granoff said the shelves are bare
because many manufacturers stopped shipping merchandise in March
when they feared the company could not pay its bills.
   Pistner said he and Granoff are studying the chain's merchandise
to determine which items the company will continue to sell. He said
they also will decide how many stores to close.
   Pistner also said he is evaluating Ames' managers.
   ``Very quickly I'll be changing key members of the team,'' he
told creditors. ``You'll see quite a few changes and you'll
recognize some of the names. I've had literally hundreds of calls
from people asking to join up.''

<HEAD>Great Northern Nekoosa Chairman Bails Out With Golden Parachute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. Chairman
William R. Laidig, who failed in his effort to thwart
Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s takeover, resigned Friday, the company said.
   The company said it anticipates Laidig's successor will be
Ronald P. Hogan, who currently is vice chairman of Great Northern
and president and chief operating officer of Georgia-Pacific.
   Laidig's departure comes roughly a month before Atlanta-based
Georgia-Pacific plans to complete its $65.75-a-share merger.
   ``He put out a letter to employees saying that he agreed to help
during the transition and had done that to the point it was most
productive,'' Great Northern spokesman Stephen M. Hill said.
   Hill referred questions on Laidig's future plans to the
departing executive. Laidig did not immediately return telephone
calls.
   Laidig will leave with a ``golden handshake'' worth millions of
dollars.
   After Georgia-Pacific initiated its unsolicited takeover attempt
last fall, the Great Northern board approved a sweetened package
that calls for Laidig to get three times his base salary plus his
highest annual bonus of the past three years.
   The company's 1989 proxy statement listed Laidig's salary at
$707,000 a year.
   Laidig had been chairman since 1984.

<HEAD>USDA Crop Estimate Sends Prices Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders reacted
negatively to U.S. Agriculture Department crop figures.
   The USDA on Thursday estimated winter wheat production at a
nine-year high of 2.09 billion bushels. That was up 44 percent from
last year's drought-reduced harvest of 1.45 billion bushels.
   This year's corn harvest was projected at 8.1 billion bushels
and soybean production was pegged at 1.92 billion bushels.
   Wheat prices were pressured by the larger-than-expected winter
wheat production estimate, analysts said. Losses built as the price
loss triggered commission house sell stops.
   Soybean prices were pressured by heavy professional selling,
although soyoil offered some support due to the Agriculture
Department's forecast of a drop in soyoil inventory.
   The decline of soybean futures spilled into corn, although
new-crop corn was boosted by positive figures in USDA's supply and
demand report.
   At the close, wheat was a { cent to 5{ cents lower with the
contract for May delivery at $3.81{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
lower to 3 cents higher with May at $2.87} a bushel; oats were 4}
cents to 6 cents lower with May at $1.60 a bushel; soybeans were
13{ cents to 17 cents lower with May at $6.31 a bushel.

<HEAD>Commission Recommends Formation Of Regional Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN McGILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal commission studying the nation's
poverty-blighted Mississipi Delta has recommended development of a
regional bank to get capital to the area's small and minority-owned
businesses.
   It's one of many recommendations in the final report of the
Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission, formed by Congress
in 1988 to determine why the resource-rich delta is the poorest in
the United States. The report is to be presented to Congress Monday.
   Section III of the four-section report deals with the problems
of private enterprise and how best to develop business in the
region, which covers 219 counties in the states of Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee and Kentucky.
   ``The delta region as a whole has substantial assets in its
banking system, and these assets currently total about $78
billion,'' the report noted.
   But that money isn't getting to the entrepreneurs who need it,
according to the report.
   Bank deposits in the region totalled $59.92 billion for 1989,
while loans totalled $44.2 billion for a loan-deposit ratio of 73.6
percent, the report said.
   Improving that ratio to the national level of 79.5 percent would
spur $3.5 billion in additional investment, the report said.
   ``In each of the Commission's public hearings, Delta business
persons addressed the need for greater access to capital and
encouraged the Delta Commission to recommend the establishment of a
regional funding entity to work with banks to increase the amount
of capital available for regional investment,'' the report said.
   A regional bank could guarantee local bank loans, provide equity
loans and various other types of financing to help small and
minority-owned businesses get started and help existing businesses
expand, the report said.
   The report encourages state and federal governments,
universities, chambers of commerce and others to share knowledge,
resources and technology.
   And it says too few delta business managers ``recognize the need
for or have access to the kind of technology, training and
resources that will strengthen their skills and expertise as
managers.''
   The report decries the lack of black business people in the
delta.
   ``Approximately 40 percent of the total population is African
American; yet, the involvement of African Americans in the business
sector is far less substantial'' the report said.
   The report also noted that industries in the delta rely too
heavily on harvesting its rich agricultural and mineral resources
and too little on making products out of them.
   The report notes Arkansas' success in developing retirement
communities and suggests other parts of the delta region could do
the same. It also touts tourism for the region, suggesting
development of a ``tourism entity'' that could promote the cultural
diversity and natural beauty of the area and work with Amtrak to
develop a major passenger train corridor through the delta.

   The stock market climbed to near-record heights
in heavy trading today, spurred on by favorable inflation news and
falling interest rates.
   The government reported this morning that the producer price
index of finished goods dropped 0.3 percent in April, in contrast
to Wall Street's expectations of a 0.1 percent-0.3 percent increase.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.6
percent last month.
   Analysts said the figures provided the markets with a double
dose of evidence that the pace of the economy remained slow and
inflationary pressures were subdued.
   That served to allay whatever fears persisted on Wall Street
that the Federal Reserve might move soon to tighten credit.
Interest rates fell in the bond and short-term money markets.

   Donald Trump said Friday his Trump
Castle Casino Resort By The Bay is not for sale despite comments
from the chairman of Hilton Hotels that he is looking into buying
the gaming hall.
   ``It's not for sale at any price,'' Trump said in a telephone
interview.
   Trump refused to say if Hilton Chairman Barron Hilton had
approached him about selling the property.
   ``I have great respect for Barron Hilton,'' Trump said. ``I
can't comment on that.''
   Hilton said after the company's stockholders meeting Thursday
that he might be interested in buying the casino.
   Hilton Hotels built the casino in 1985 for $320 million but had
to sell it after the state Casino Control Commission denied them a
license because of ties to reputed organized crime attorney Sidney
Korshak.
   The two commissioners who voted against Hilton are no longer on
the panel.
   Trump Castle placed eighth among the city's 12 casinos in gross
gaming revenues last month.
   Trump has said he wants to sell some of his assets to raise
cash, but has added he does not plan to sell any of his three
casinos.

<HEAD>Image of Traders Concern of Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   As the trial of three commodities brokers charged in a
wide-ranging probe of corruption commenced in a Chicago courtroom,
a group of floor traders in New York engaged in an effort to redeem
the tainted image of their profession.
   The Floor Brokers and Traders Association, formed a year after
the futures industry came under intense scrutiny for suspected
trading abuses, wants to administer its own ethics pledge to
traders.
   In addition, the organization wants to encourage members to
attend ethics classes tailored to the moral choices and challenges
of trading, in which fortunes can be made and lost in a few
minutes' time.
   Although image is a major concern, the group's president Michael
Wilner says the organization will address other issues, such as the
controversial practice of dual trading _ which it favors _ and
working conditions on the floor of New York's commodity exchanges.
   The association has attracted about 520 members in the past two
months _ among them traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the Commodity Exchange and the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange.
   Wilner, president of Hilltop Trading Co., said they all have one
thing in common _ they are hardworking, down to earth guys.
   ``Our belief is that the majority of traders are above-board
professionals,'' Wilner said. ``And we don't want our image
hammered by the misdeeds of a few.''
   In Chicago, Danny L. Scheck, Robert D. Mosky and David Zatz are
on trial in U.S. District Court on charges stemming from an FBI
probe of trading fraud at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
Chicago Board of Trade.
   The government's case rests partly on tapes made by an FBI agent
who secretly recorded conversations while posing in 1988 as a
corrupt trader in the Swiss franc futures trading pit at the
Mercantile Exchange.
   The government contends the tape recordings reveal a variety of
schemes employed by the trio to divert customer profits to their
own accounts.
   But defense lawyers say the tapes portray their clients' proper
attempts to verify trades they made with each other and the agent
amid the hubbub that is typical of a futures trading pit.
   Wilner said the association wants to change the image of floor
traders from the public perception of them as brash rich gamblers
who bet on the future prices of basics ranging from soybeans to
pork bellies.
   The association plans a newsletter to keep traders educated
about regulatory issues, to assure they are in compliance with the
rules, Wilner said.
   But image is only one concern of the association.
   Wilner said the group plans to defend dual trading _ in which
floor traders execute customer orders and trade for themselves at
the same time. Critics say the practice creates enormous
opportunities for cheating and enables traders to executive
profitable dealers for themselves before they take care of clients.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency
responsible for policing the futures pits, has proposed phasing in
a dual-trading ban.
   ``Dual trading is appropriate,'' Wilner said, adding that he has
found that most customers are comfortable with it.
   ``The reason it is an advantage is it ensures a high caliber of
experience. And compensation comes not only from salary and
commission, but from one's own trading account.''
   Quality of life issues are also a concern for the group.
   The Comex, NYMEX, Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange as well as the
New York Futures Exchange and the Cotton Exchange all share the
same floor space in the World Trade Center.
   The cramped floor space stunts the growth of the exchanges, and
makes the traders' jobs more difficult. The association hopes to
have input in the search for larger quarters, as well as find
affordable health insurance for traders, Wilner said.

<HEAD>Auction Investors Bet Rates Have Peaked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors showed by their vigorous bidding for
the Treasury's auction of $30.5 billion in new notes and bonds this
past week that they think interest rates have peaked.
   Moreover, new evidence of moderating inflation and slow economic
growth on Friday helped the market end the week with an impressive
rally that drove yields on 30-year Treasury bonds toward 8.65
percent. That is a huge move from the 9.05 percent yields that
prevailed only two weeks earlier.
   Market watchers remained divided, however, on whether rates are
going to continue to fall, and how soon the decline will be
reflected in rates for mortghage and consumer loans.
   ``Mortgage rates tend to follow Treasury rates with a lag,''
said Lincoln Anderson, economist for Bear Stearns &amp; Co. ``There is
a connection, but the linkage is not tight.''
   Anderson, who thinks long-term Treasury rates are going to fall
by another percentage point or more by the end of the year, said
those making mortgage and other consumer loans are going to wait to
make sure rates don't bounce higher before they adjust their own
lending rate schedules.
   Mickey Levy, chief economist for First Fidelity Bancorporation
of Newark, N.J., said he thinks Treasury rates have peaked and
mortgage rates will decline modestly within a month.
   But other analysts said yields ran up so quickly in April after
the government's March consumer price report indicated inflation
was accelerating that mortgage lenders did not fully reflect the
increase in their rates.
   As a result, they said, there may be less room for mortgage
rates to fall.
   Chief Economist Lyle E. Gramley of the Mortgage Bankers
Association said the potential for further increases in bond prices
and rate declines ``is rather limited.''
   The former Federal Reserve Board governor said the effective
rate on mortgage loans including special charges was close to 11
percent two weeks ago and may have fallen to 10.75 percent in
recent days with the potential to drop to 10.50 percent. ``We're
not likely to see much better than that,'' he said.
   Aubrey H. Zaffuto, economist of IBJ Schroder Bank &amp; Trust, said
she expects there will be only minimal impact on consumer rates as
a result of the drop in Treasury yields.
   She said the government's borrowing needs are likely to
accelerate this summer while credit demands from Eastern Europe
will grow, both putting more pressure on interest rates.
   ``I can't see that we have a clear shot at lower rates. I think
they are going to stay where they are now in a trading range,'' she
said.
   The sharp declines in interest rates cut the government's
potential borrowing costs considerably from what they had been 10
days earlier.
   Yields on 30-year bonds had risen as high as 9.05 percent in
late April, mainly because reports on March consumer prices
indicated to some traders that the economy and inflation were
accelerating to the detriment of bond prices.
   But the government caught a break on May 4 when the employmnet
report for April indicated the economy ands inflation were weaker
than expected.
   Bond prices staged one of the biggest rallies of the year that
day, dropping yields as low as 8.81 percent on 30-year Treasury
bonds.
   The backdrop for the Treasury refunding auction could not have
been better.
   On Tuesday, investors snapped up $10.5 billion in three-year
notes at an average yield of 8.74 percent and turned in more than
$3.53 in bids for each $1 in notes sold, the biggest imbalance of
that sort since August 1985.
   There was similarly strong demand for $10 billion in 10-year
notes which were sold on Wednesday at an average yield of 8.88
percent. The ratio of $3 in bids for every $1 in notes sold was the
second largest on record for a 10-year note auction, according to
the investment firm Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The auction concluded Thursday, as $10 billion in 30-year bonds
were sold for an average yield of 8.84 percent, lower than the
yield commanded by the 10-year notes and another indication of
healthy demand.
   The government's reports on Friday that its producer price index
fell 0.3 percent in April as retail sales fell 0.6 percent touched
off a rousing rally.
   By midafternoon, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds were as low as
8.66 percent, or nearly four-tenths of a percentage point below
their peaks two weeks earlier. That is an extraordinary move in
that time frame.
   ``They indicated moderating inflation and moderate, maybe
slowing, economic activity. That is music to a bond investor's
ears,'' said Elliott Platt, who follows the credit markets for
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   ``We were off to the races... It was incredible,'' he said.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Decline As Gasoline Rally Ends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices declined and carried the rest of
the energy market lower as supply concerns abated Friday.
   The contract for June delivery of unleaded regular gasoline fell
1.79 cents to 61.89 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Earlier in the week, gasoline rose sharply as traders worried
that supplies would run tight in the Gulf of Mexico.
   A pipeline that serves 36 drilling platforms and handles 95,000
barrels of oil a day was shut down, raising the possibility of
disruptions to refineries just as they were preparing to process
large quantities of crude for the summer driving season.
   However, concerns eased as fuel cargoes destined for the
Atlantic Coast were diverted to the Gulf Coast, and traders
consequently sold gasoline lower, said Andrew Lebow, an analyst
with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   The slide in gasoline brought other futures down. The June
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude, declined 7 cents to $18.95 a 42-gallon barrel.
   Heating oil for June delivery dropped 0.79 cent to 50.92 cents a
gallon.
   Natural gas for June delivery fell to $1.565 per 1,000 cubic
feet from $1.574 Wednesday.

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said its had
first quarter net income of $4.3 million, compared with a loss of
$421,000 in the same three months last year.
   After payment of preferred stock dividends, however, the company
posted a loss of 15 cents for each share of common stock. That
compared with a loss of 25 cents a share a year earlier.
   Revenues rose 25 percent to $291 million from $232 million.
   The company said it made large expenditures to establish a new

original movie productions for the Turner Network Television
channel.
   Such investments, said TBS Chairman Ted Turner, ``are essential
to our plans for continued growth.''

<HEAD>Capture Ban, Growing Demand Sends Dolphin Prices Soaring</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the most valuable investments these
days may be a Flipper lookalike.
   Dolphin prices are soaring. One reason is an unexplained Dolphin
illness in the Gulf of Mexico, a prime frolicking ground for the
intelligent mammals, which has forced a ban on dolphin captures
there.
   Moreover, demand for flipper lookalikes has jumped markedly from
tourist businesses, which range from swim-with-the-dolphin theme
park attractions to aquariums and even a casino.
   Federal officials say they've recently heard of offers made for
top performing dolphins from $50,000 to $100,000 apiece, but exact
figures are guarded industry secrets.
   ``So long as they are captured and cared for under the law, I
don't care how much money they make,'' said Chuck Oravetz,
protected species coordinator for the National Marine Fisheries
Service branch in St. Petersburg. ``Economics is not something we
delve into.''
   But the stakes could keep climbing because the Gulf of Mexico,
where nearly all dolphins for display are captured, is off limits
until scientists can determine what has caused the 237 known
dolphin deaths so far this year.
   A 90-day federal moratorium on captures was scheduled to last
through mid-June but may be extended if the dolphin deaths continue.
   Even when captures are resumed, new quotas will be in effect to
further restrict how many dolphins can be taken from the wild. That
will make those in captivity much more valuable.
   ``It's a matter of the laws of supply and demand,'' said Nick
Brown, director of the non-profit National Aquarium in Baltimore,
which plans to open a $35 million marine mammal facility by this
fall. ``We're having a hard time keeping up.''
   In the past year, the National Aquarium's budget to procure
dolphins has jumped from $300,000 to more than $1 million because
of increased demand, Brown said.
   Nine facilities, which also include Disney World and the
Indianapolis Zoo, have permits to capture a total of 36 dolphins
from the Gulf this year. Those plans are on hold.
   But it's the latest entry into the business that is causing the
most controversy _ dolphins will soon compete with showgirls and
slot machines at the Mirage hotel and casino on the shimmering Las
Vegas strip.
   ``Whenever a facility has never held dolphins before, there's
controversy, especially when it has a lot of money to spend,'' said
Ann Terbush, chief of the fisheries service's permit division in
Silver Spring, Md. ``I think the Mirage has had an effect on
increasing the price of dolphins.''
   Behind the Mirage swimming pool, workers are putting the
finishing touches on a 1.5 million gallon display that is set to
open with six dolphins in September.
   ``We have a 20,000-gallon tropical fish tank, a rain forest and
a display of tigers _ now we'll have a state-of-the art facility
for dolphins,'' said Mirage spokesman Alan Feldman. ``It's another
attraction that makes the Mirage a special place.''
   He emphasized there are no plans for the dolphins to perform
tricks and it will not be a swim-with-the-dolphins attraction.
``The primary purpose is to help educate the public about
dolphins.''
   As a new dolphin display, the Mirage has a federal permit
restricting its acquisition to animals already in captivity.
   Although Feldman would not elaborate on the bids the Mirage is
making for dolphins, he said money wasn't the prime concern.
   ``It's not like something you walk into Sears and buy,'' Feldman
said. ``Yes, it's expensive to the extent we are willing to buy
dolphins that have been well cared for and that are healthy.''
   In April, the Mirage purchased its first dolphin, an 8-year-old
female performer named Sigma, from the recently closed SeaArama in
Galveston, Texas, fisheries service officials said.
   ``Price is confidential,'' said SeaArama dolphin supervisor John
Dellanera, adding that it was less than the rumored $100,000. ``It
was a more than fair price.''
   The trading of dolphins as just another marketable commodity
galls activists such as Richard O'Barry, a former trainer for the
Flipper television series who now runs the Miami-based Dolphin
Project, an organization dedicated to protecting dolphins.
   ``It's a very sleazy business,'' said O'Barry, who has protested
the Mirage facility.
   ``A casino is no place for dolphins,'' he said. ``It's going to
be `Dolphins for the Rich and Famous.'''
   The Dolphin Project follows the activities of known dolphin
trappers and attempts to track the prices paid for dolphins.
   O'Barry said some marine veterinarians routinely charge approved
facilities $20,000 to capture dolphins from the wild, while dolphin
stars trained to leap for fish and jump through hoops command
prices up to $100,000.
   Jay Sweeney, a San Diego marine mammal veterinarian who has
trapped dolphins for several facilities, said the price he charges
for the service varies, but it is around $10,000 plus expenses for
his boats and crew of eight. Opponents of Dolphin trading say
regulation is not tight enough because of the inherent conflict of
interest in the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The Commerce
Department and the National Marine Fisheries Service, empowered to
protect the interests of business, are also in charge of protecting
dolphins.
   But the fisheries service contends there is a misperception
about how many dolphins are actually captured and in captivity.
   Of the estimated 45,000 dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico, the
fisheries service reported only 25 captured last year. The quota
allowed to be taken this year, if the capture ban is lifted, will
be lowered from 91 to 35. There are 351 dolphins in captivity in
the United States, fisheries service figures show.
   Those numbers pale in comparison to the estimated 100,000
dolphins that have died annually in the nets of tuna fleets fishing
in the eastern tropical Pacific. Tuna companies selling brands such
as Starkist, Chicken of the Sea and Bumble Bee have recently
announced they've switched to fishing methods that won't kill the
dolphins.
   Regardless of the emphasis on commercialization, the National
Aquarium's Brown says dolphin displays not only satisfy the
national fascination for the creatures, but also promote
understanding.
   ``I don't see the silent majority out there jumping on this
bandwagon that targets dolphin displays as an issue like the
homeless or abortion,'' he said. ``Being able to go some place and
see dolphins goes a long way toward making people aware of their
environment and conservation efforts.''

<HEAD>Strengthening Yen Sends Dollar Into Tailspin</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS West German mark value to 1.6378 in 20th graf</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar went into a tailspin against the
Japanese yen Friday as investors reassessed the health of the
Japanese and U.S. economies.
   The yen's dramatic advance began overnight in Tokyo, where
record-setting trading volume in the Japanese currency signaled
that investor confidence in Japan's economy was being renewed.
   The move was hastened later in the United States on fresh
government reports indicating the economy is weakening and
inflation is being curbed. But by the close of domestic trading,
the dollar had recovered against all currencies except the yen and
the British pound.
   Nearly $22 billion worth of yen changed hands Friday in Tokyo,
more than double an average day's volume of around $8 billion to $9
billion, said James McGroarty, senior vice president at Greenwich
Capital Markets Inc. in Greenwich, Conn.
   As the yen soared, the dollar spiraled down. In Tokyo, the
dollar closed at 154.15 yen, off 2.60 yen from Thursday. It fell
further in London, where it settled at 153.75 yen, and later closed
at 152.70 yen in New York, off sharply from late Thursday's 156.50
yen.
   Friday's trading in New York represented a roughly 3.5 percent
drop from a week earlier, when the dollar traded at about 158.30
yen in New York.
   Traders were ``quite surprised by the significant drop in the
value of the dollar overnight, which precipitated further selling''
when trading shifted to U.S. markets, McGroarty said.
   A Labor Department report showing an unexpected 0.3 percent
decline in April wholesale prices, coupled with a 0.6 decline in
retail sales during the month, accelerated the dollar's fall.
   The reports fueled the notion that the Federal Reserve will not
need to raise interest rates to cool the economy. Higher interest
rates increase the relative attractiveness of returns on
dollar-denominated securities.
   That helped spark rallies in other U.S. markets. Stock prices
shot higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average finishing up
more than 63 points, and bond prices rising more than $17.50 per
$1,000 in face value.
   But despite the speculation of lower U.S. interest rates, the
day's foreign exchange activity was ``more of a yen story than a
dollar story,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc.
   He said investors were beginning to react to the Group of
Seven's contention that Japan's economic fundamentals do not
justify such a low yen.
   Earlier this month in Washington, finance ministers of the seven
leading industrialized nations agreed to support a higher yen to
prevent ``undesirable consequences'' for the world economy.
   While there has not been any evidence of central bank
intervention to push the yen higher, heavy yen-buying ``implies
major investors have had another reassessment (and said) maybe
things aren't that bad in Japan,'' McGroarty said.
   Analysts note the Japanese stock market, which had lost 30
percent in value since January, is beginning to recover and Japan's
bond market remains strong.
   On the surface, the dollar's decline against the yen appeared to
be a logical progression, because the U.S. currency traded at
two-year lows against the Swiss franc and the West German mark this
week.
   But some market observers are bearish on dollar's near-term
future as well.
   ``The market is losing its enthusiasm for speculating in favor
of the dollar,'' Brusca said. ``Over the past few days (investors)
have been acutely aware of ... the pressure on the Fed to ease
rates and the potential for a tax hike to occur.''
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6817 from $1.6770 late
Thursday. In New York the dollar rose to $1.6790 from Thursday's
$1.6775.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late rates, included: 1.6378 West German marks, up from 1.6325;
1.3995 Swiss francs, up from 1.3915; 5.5295 French francs, up from
5.5115; 1,207.75 Italian lire, up from 1,202.75, and 1.1758
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1703.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's late
rates, included: 1.6300 West German marks, down from 1.6368; 1.3955
Swiss francs, up from 1.3950; 5.5096 French francs, down from
5.5235; 1.8330 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8407; 1,200.40 Italian
lire, down from 1,205.75, and 1.1783 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1650.
   Gold prices fell worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange,
gold bullion for current delivery fell $1.30 a troy ounce to settle
at $368.80 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank in New York quoted
bullion at $368.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down $2 from late
Thursday.
   In London gold fell to a late bid of $369.05 a troy ounce from
$371.35; in Zurich, gold fell to a closing $368.80 an ounce from
$371.25. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.12 to close at a bid of
$369.10 a troy ounce.
   Silver prices also fell. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery slipped to $5.043 a troy ounce from $5.088 on
Thursday. In London, silver fell to a late bid of $5.06 a troy
ounce from $5.08.

<HEAD>Grains, Soybeans Lower on Bearish USDA Crop Figures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower Friday on
the Chicago Board of Trade as traders reacted negatively to U.S.
Agriculture Department crop figures.
   On other markets, precious metals futures were lower, livestock
prices were mostly higher, pork was mixed and energy prices fell.
   Wheat settled a { cent to 5{ cents lower with the contract for
May delivery at $3.81{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents lower to 3{
cents higher with May at $2.87{ a bushel; oats were 5{ cents to 6\
cents lower with May at $1.60 a bushel; soybeans were 14{ cents to
17{ cents lower with May at $6.32 a bushel.
   Traders gave a bearish interpretation to the figures released
Thursday by the Agriculture Department.
   The USDA estimated winter wheat production at a nine-year high
of 2.09 billion bushels. That was up 44 percent from last year's
drought-reduced harvest of 1.45 billion bushels.
   This year's corn harvest was projected at 8.1 billion bushels
and soybean production was pegged at 1.92 billion bushels.
   The size of the projected wheat harvest was larger than
expected, triggering Friday's selloff. Thoughts that the large crop
could spur export sales gave some support to the market, though,
analysts said.
   Soybean prices were pressured by heavy professional selling,
although soyoil offered some support because of the Agriculture
Department's forecast of a drop in soyoil inventory.
   The decline of soybean futures spilled into corn, although
new-crop corn was boosted by positive figures in USDA's supply and
demand report.
   Precious metals prices were lower on the New York Commodity
Exchange.
   Selling of gold was a continuation of selling on the overnight
markets, said Peter Caudillo, an analyst with Josephthal &amp; Co. in
New York.
   The market also was pressured by the release of figures from the
Labor Department that showed inflation at the wholesale level was
running at a 4.2 percent annual rate, down from 4.8 percent for all
of 1989. Wholesale prices actually fell in April. Investors usually
buy gold as a hedge against inflation.
   ``The malaise in the market also is due to the heavy producer
selling by Australia and South Africa and the threat of gold sales
by the Soviet Union'' to finance grain purchases, Caudillo said.
   Gold was $1.40 to $1.70 lower with June at $370.50 a troy ounce;
silver was 4.5 cents to 5 cents lower with May at $5.065 a troy
ounce.
   Energy futures were mostly lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   There was little news to influence the market, said Robert
Baker, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
However, crude oil gained support during its fall from a report
Kuwait was cutting back on spot sales, an indication it was
complying with OPEC efforts to cut back production.
   Gasoline prices plunged as the market realized the tightness in
gasoline stocks was not as severe as first believed, Baker said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 1 cent to 14 cents lower
with June at $18.95 a barrel; heating oil was .27 cent to .92 cent
lower with June at 50.92 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .55
cent to 1.79 cents lower with June at 61.89 cents a gallon.
   Livestock futures were mostly higher and pork futures mixed in
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle prices received support from expectations the number of
cattle going into feed lots in coming months will decline, said Tom
Morgan of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington, Ill.
   Pork prices were pressured by lower cash prices and the belief
the market is overbought after a run up in prices in recent weeks,
Morgan said.
   Live cattle were .13 cent lower to .22 cent higher with June at
74.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .22 cent
higher with May at 84.82 cents a pound; hogs were .67 cent lower to
.10 cent higher with June at 63.65 cent a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 2 cents lower to .75 cent higher with May at 64 cents
a pound.

   A record drop in vegetable costs contributed
to a second straight decline in wholesale prices last month, the
government said Friday, sparking rallies in the stock and bond
markets.
   The Labor Department's Producer Price Index for finished goods,
one stop short of retail, fell a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent
last month.
   It was the sharpest decline since August and the third
consecutive moderate report after a severe cold snap sent prices
spiraling 1.8 percent in January. The index fell 0.2 percent in
March and was unchanged in February.
   ``The inflation scare is over,'' declared economist Lawrence A.
Hunter of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   For the first four months of the year, inflation at the
wholesale level was running at a 4.2 percent annual rate, down from
4.8 percent for all of 1989.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales
unexpectedly slumped 0.6 percent in April, the third month without
an increase.
   Financial markets rallied and interest rates fell in response to
the reports. Traders said the figures provided a double dose of
evidence that economic growth and inflation remain subdued.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbed 63.07 to
2,801.58, its third highest closing ever. The price of the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond surged 1} points, driving the
yield down more than an eighth of a percentage point to 8.66
percent.
   Lower rates knocked the dollar, however. It dropped to 152.70
Japanese yen, off 3.80 yen from Thursday.
   The reports, along with one last week showing the April
unemployment rate rising to 5.4 percent, likely will convince
Federal Reserve monetary policy makers to leave interest rates
unchanged when they meet Tuesday, economists said.
   Prior to the April figures, many economists believed the Fed
would nudge interest rates higher out of concern that growth was
rebounding too strongly and inflation was reigniting.
   ``We started the year worrying about a recession, then we
worried about inflation and now there's worry about a recession
again. People are zigzagging on this,'' said economist Donald
Ratajczak of Georgia State University.
   A panel of 19 economists employed by the nation's largest
corporations on Friday predicted slow but sustained economic growth
through 1991. The economy, as measured by the gross national
product, will grow 2 percent in 1990 and 2.6 percent in 1991, down
from 3 percent in 1989, they said.
   The forecast was released in Hot Springs, Va., where the
nation's top corporate executives are gathering for a meeting of
The Business Council.
   The Labor Department said food prices fell 0.6 percent in April
after an identical decline a month earlier. Prices rose for eggs,
rice, pasta and pork. They fell for fruit, chicken, cooking oils
and candy.
   Vegetable prices, which fell 25.5 percent in March after record
increases in the preceding two months, fell an additional 31.1
percent last month. It was the biggest drop since the government
began tracking those costs in 1967. Tomato prices fell 73.3 percent.
   Energy prices dropped 1.7 percent after declining in the two
previous months. Gasoline prices, with the start of the warm
weather driving season, climbed 2.2 percent. Fuel oil prices,
however, fell 1.9 percent while natural gas costs dropped 5.5
percent.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose a
modest 0.2 percent after rising a 0.3 percent advance in March.
Economists said this ``core'' number is often a better indicator of
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy than the
calculation that includes food and energy expenses.
   Automobile prices fell 0.9 percent in April. Clothing price
inflation recovered from increases a month earlier. Women's, men's
and boys' clothing costs were unchanged. Girls' and infants'
clothing prices fell 0.2 percent.
   Prices rose for medicines, soap, floor coverings and toys. They
fell for alcoholic beverages, jewelry and magazines.
   The various changes put the index for all finished goods at
117.0 in April. That means a hypothetical selection of goods that
cost $100 in 1982 would have cost $117 last month, up from $113 a
year earlier.
   Price pressures in earlier stages of the production process were
moderate in April. Prices for intermediate goods rose a slight 0.1
percent. Crude good prices fell 3.1 percent, pulled down by a 12
percent drop for crude oil, the largest in four years.
   An example of the three processing stages _ finished,
intermediate and crude _ would be clothing, cloth and cotton.
   Despite the moderate report for wholesale prices last month,
some economists remain concerned that inflation may accelerate this
year.
   Consumer prices, up at an annual rate of 8.5 percent in the
first quarter, are rising at a steeper pace than wholesale costs.
   Why the divergence between the two sets of prices?
   Wholesale prices reflect only the cost of goods, while consumer
prices are heavily influenced by the cost of services, which have
been less affected by the economic slowdown of recent months.
   Economic growth has slowed enough to soften demand and hold down
goods prices, but not enough to greatly affect employment and thus
the cost of services.
   ``Whatever inflationary pressures there are in the economy are
stemming from the relative scarcity of labor,'' said economist
Sandra Shaber of The Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm.

   The stock market rose sharply to near-record
heights Friday in an exuberant reaction to favorable inflation news
and falling interest rates.
   Trading volume picked up to its heaviest pace of the year as the
market extended a two-week old rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 63.07 points to
2,801.58, its third-highest close ever and less than nine points
below the peak of 2,810.15 reached on Jan. 2. Over the past 10
sessions the average has risen 156.53 points, or 5.9 percent.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 7 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,282 up, 339 down and 384 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 234.04 million
shares, up from 158.46 million Friday and the largest total since a
240.39 million-share day on Dec. 15.
   The government reported Friday morning that the producer price
index of finished goods dropped 0.3 percent in April, in contrast
to Wall Street's expectations of a 0.1 percent-0.3 percent
increase. Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales
fell 0.6 percent last month.
   Analysts said the figures provided the markets with a double
dose of evidence that the pace of the economy remained slow and
inflationary pressures were subdued.
   That served to allay whatever fears persisted on Wall Street
that the Federal Reserve might move soon to tighten credit.
Interest rates fell in the bond and short-term money markets.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose about $17.50 for each
$1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 8.66
percent-8.73 percent range.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Express rose 1 to
28}; International Business Machines 1| to 114; Exxon 1\ to 47~;
Philip Morris ~ to 44\, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph 1 to 42\.
   Bank and other financial issues drew some particular benefit
from increasing hopes that a ``credit crunch'' could be avoided
with interest rates headed down.
   Citicorp gained 1\ to 24; Chase Manhattan 1&lsqb; to 25&lsqb;; J.P. Morgan
1\ to 36}, and BankAmerica { to 29&rsqb;.
   Among the mortgage issues, Federal Home Loan Mortgage jumped 3\

   Securities-industry stocks also got a lift. Merrill Lynch
climbed 2 to 23{; Salomon 1&rsqb; to 22~; PaineWebber 1 to 17|, and
Charles Schwab } to 16{.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 273.78 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $68.90 billion, or
2.10 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 4.10 to 192.24.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 9.24 to 409.45, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 8.18 at 352.00.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
4.90 to 438.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 352.50, up 3.58.

<HEAD>Douglas Plans 1000 More Layoffs in Latest Blow to California
Aerospace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At McDonnell Douglas Corp. in Long Beach, at
Lockheed Corp. in Burbank, at companies that employ a
quarter-million workers in Los Angeles County alone, the question
is the same.
   How much worse can the aerospace business get in California?
   Aerospace, for decades one of the biggest cogs in the state's
$700 billion economy, is now threatened on one side by defense
cuts, on the other by the high costs of living and doing business
in California.
   Layoffs are suddenly a near-daily event.
   On Friday, Gencorp Inc.'s Aerojet division said it would merge
two rocket propulsion units in Sacramento, cutting 200 jobs. A week
earlier, Aerojet announced more than 200 layoffs at its Chino and
Downey plants after losing a key contract. Total Aerojet employment
was 7,977 at the end of 1988, 7,237 at the end of 1989, and 7,028
at the end of April, before the latest cuts.
   On Thursday, McDonnell Douglas increased its estimate of layoffs
this summer at its loss-plagued Long Beach aircraft unit from 3,000
to 4,000.
   Also during the week, Lockheed said it would close its historic
Burbank operations by mid-1990. It will move much of the work to an
Atlanta suburb to save $75 million a year and make the company a
leaner competitor for dwindling government contract work.
   Lockheed's ``Skunk Works,'' where top-secret researchers dreamed
up the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes and the stealth fighter, will stay
in Southern California, in the desert city of Palmdale, but a total
of 4,500 Lockheed jobs are expected to be lost.
   Most business analysts say the economies of the state and of the
greater Los Angeles area, where aerospace is centered, are far more
diversified than during the last big round of defense cuts in
1970-71. That means the aerospace woes won't trigger an all-out
regional recession like the one in the late 1980s in the oil
states, they say.
   The latest data available to the Los Angeles Area Chamber of
Commerce showed that in the first quarter of 1990, aerospace jobs
in the county totaled 270,000, down 14,800 from the first quarter
of 1989. Yet in the same year, the total non-farm jobs in the
county rose by 99,000 to 4.3 million.
   ``So that to me indicates that, yes, we've been having some
major hits from aerospace, but the economy has a little more
resilience that the nay-sayers would lead you to believe,'' said
Jack Kyser, the chamber's chief economist.
   Kyser acknowledged, though, that many of the aerospace job
losses came in a category that's hard to replace: high-paying
blue-collar jobs at a time when the cost of housing has skyrocketed.
   David Hensley of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project expects
that in the next few years California's economy will grow at only
about the national rate of 2 percent, down from the 7 percent
yearly clip of the mid-1980s.
   The latest UCLA forecast, released in March, predicted
California aerospace employment would fall from 361,000 in 1989 to
316,000 in 1992. Hensley says he'd put the number even lower today.
   Not only is the aerospace pie shrinking, but bigger pieces of it
are being carved up out of state, where land and labor costs are
cheaper.
   ``In the 1980s we opened a lot of facilities out of state,''
said Richard H. Dore, a spokesman for General Motors Corp.'s Hughes
Aircraft Co. unit in El Segundo, still the biggest employer in
Southern California.
   Hughes employment, which peaked at 80,000 in 1985, has now
stabilized at about 68,000 after 9,000 layoffs last year. The loss
of jobs in Southern California, though, is greater than 12,000
because of the growth in out-of-state employment.

<HEAD>China's Favored Nation Status Looms As Next Crisis in US-Chinese
Ties</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic planned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Disastrous and catastrophic are the words most
frequently used to describe the possible U.S. suspension of China's
trade status as a most-favored nation _ and that's just American
businessmen talking.
   One senior Chinese executive, Wei Mingyi of the state-run China
International Trust and Investment Corp., said it would set
relations back 20 years. In 1970, the two countries did not even
have diplomatic ties.
   The issue may not be decided for weeks. President Bush must
decide by June 3 whether to renew China's MFN status for another
year, and he is expected to act in China's favor.
   But critics in Congress may try to overrrule him as part of
their attempt to ostracize China for its suppression of political
dissenters, symbolized by the army attack on student protestors
last June 4. The critics argue economic retaliation is an important
weapon to pressure China into reform.
   This means the battle over China's trade status with the United
States, a crucial part of their relationship, could be prolonged.
   China and its allies on this issue in the American business
community have begun readying for the fray _ only the latest round
in Washington's debate over whether sanctions help or hurt the
cause of democracy in China.
   The United States imposed limited economic sanctions last year,
but Bush has eased several, such as a ban on high-tech exports.
   Signaling how seriously China takes the threat to MFN, in the
past two weeks it lifted martial law in the Tibetan city of Lhasa
and announced the release of 211 pro-democracy protesters. Both
moves were widely seen as an effort to counter criticism of its
human rights record.
   It also disclosed that authorities allowed 238,000 people go
abroad on private business last year, which it said was up 11
percent from the previous year. U.S. law bars giving MFN status to
any country that denies residents freedom of emigration.
   American businessmen in Beijing and Hong Kong, meanwhile, have
begun a letter-writing campaign to their congressmen urging that
MFN be extended. The American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing issued
a nine-page position paper arguing that revoking MFN would be
``catastrophic to American business interests in China and American
consumers of Chinese products.''
   The chamber's Hong Kong branch, worried because most U.S.-China
trade passes through the territory, sent a delegation to testify on
Capitol Hill this past week.
   ``To revoke MFN would be an act of economic warfare, and it's an
act on the Chinese people, not the Chinese government,'' said an
American businessmen who has lived in Beijing for several years.
   ``I was here last June. It's been a sad time to be here in
China,'' he said. ``But ... let's not slam the door on them. I know
many Chinese people and I have yet to find one who thinks it would
be helpful to lift MFN.''
   Most-favored-nation status, which the United States grants to
all but a few nations, substantially reduces tariffs on goods
exported to the United States.
   Without it, the U.S. tariff on Chinese-made sweaters would rise
from the current 6 percent to 60 percent. The duty on Chinese toys
would go from less than 7 percent to 70 percent, the
Washington-based U.S.-China Business Council has estimated.
   Toys, sweaters and other garments accounted for most of China's
$12 billion in exports to the United States last year, which in
turn comprised nearly one-third of China's total exports.
   With higher tariffs, Chinese sales to the United States would
drop at least 50 percent, the council predicted.
   Most U.S. toy and clothing merchandisers could find alternate
suppliers, but for Chinese manufacturers, ``there really isn't
another market,'' said a Western economist in Beijing, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Their exports to Japan and the European Community are growing
very slowly. They're just not going to sell much of this stuff to
South Korea and Indonesia,'' he said.
   The impact on the Chinese economy could be serious, especially
in the export-driven coastal areas, analysts agree.
   China has not said how it would retaliate, but at a minimum it
likely would suspend reciprocal preferential tariffs. That could
affect U.S. wheat farmers and fertilizer and airplane
manufacturers, leaders in the United States' $5.7 billion worth of
exports to China.
   U.S. joint ventures in China fear suspending MFN could create so
much hostility that they would be unable to operate. The American
Chamber of Commerce predicted problems in getting Chinese
government cooperation essential to obtain loans, contracts, raw
materials and even electricity.
   Recent commentaries in China's official media have warned that
political relations would suffer as well.
   The U.S. business community's outcry over the prospect of losing
the China market comes in sharp contrast to its usual complaints
about the slowness and expense of doing business in China.
   ``China's always been a difficult place to do business,''
acknowledged a representative for a major American sportswear
importer. ``You have to make a lot of trips to the factories to
guarantee quality. You really have to do a high volume to make a
profit.''
   But he added, ``China has one-fourth of the world's people. Even
if you have to go through a lot of hassles _ no other place can
replace China.''

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd grafs, The Treasury's ... to UPDATE with closing
yield of 8.66 percent.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rocketed higher Friday, swept up by
new evidence that the economy is not overheating and by relief that
the Treasury successfully has completed its quarterly auctions of
new securities.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond climbed 1} points, or
about $17.50 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield tumbled to 8.66
percent from 8.83 percent late Thursday.
   The big rally reflected a marked change in market psychology.
Only two weeks ago, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds were pushed
over 9 percent because of worries that the econonmy and inflation
were moving at such a rapid clip that the Federal Reserve would
push interest rates higher.
   But over the past six sessions, a series of new government
reports have convinced many traders that the economy is growing
only moderately and inflationary pressures are subsiding.
   ``The markets have had a fairly remarkable six days,'' said
Steven A. Wood, economist for BankAmerica Capital Markets Group in
San Francisco.
   Friday's rally came a day after the completion of the
government's three-day quarterly refunding, in which a record $30.5
billion in new notes and bonds were auctioned to finance government
operations.
   In when-issued trading, the yield on the Treasury's new 30-year
bond tumbled to 8.64 percent from an average yield of 8.84 percent
at auction on Thursday.
   Trading was described as fairly active on Friday after the
government released a pair of economic reports that indicated the
Federal Reserve will not be inclined to raise interest rates, which
would erode the value of bonds.
   The Labor Department reported wholesale prices edged down 0.3
percent, while many analysts had expected a 0.2 percent increase.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell a
steep 0.6 percent in April.
   The reports appeared to verify the conclusions about the economy
that traders drew from last Friday's April employment report
showing lower than expected job creation and wage inflation.
   Over the past three days, the Treasury found investors
enthusiastic about buying new three-year and 10-year notes and
30-year bonds, evidently in an effort to lock in current yields
because they expected rates to fall.
   Wood said he thinks there is room for further rate declines next
week when the government reports on industrial production and
consumer prices for April.
   ``I think the market has room to do little better, and even if
those reports are wore, I don't think it will give all of these
gains back,'' he said.
   But other analysts warn that the market has gained so much
ground so quickly a reversal could lie ahead.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose by \ point to { point, intermediate maturities
gained by between | point and 1 3-32 points and long-term issues
rose as much as 1} points, according to Telerate Inc., the
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 8.61 to 1,149.32.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 27-32 to 91 1-16. The average yield to
maturity tumbled to 7.54 percent from 7.62 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.86 percent as the
discount lost 10 basis points to 7.61 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 8.05 percent as the discount fell 7 basis points to
7.64 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.20 percent as the
discount fell 10 basis points to 7.63 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, unchanged
from late Thursday.

<HEAD>States Reportedly Approve Plan to Restrict Insurers' Holdings of
Junk Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regulators in 11 states on Thursday approved
recommendations aimed at limiting insurance companies' holdings of
junk bonds, a newspaper reported.
   The restrictions on the high-yield, high-risk bonds are expected
to be approved by regulators from all 50 states next month and
would be binding on insurers, The New York Times said in an early
edition of Friday's paper.
   ``Our motivation is to prevent companies from concentrating
their investments in these bonds,'' the Times quoted Terence
Lennon, assistant deputy superintendent of the New York State
Insurance Department, as saying.
   Lennon headed the subcommittee of the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners that issued the recommendations.
   Regulators are proposing to phase in the guidelines over five
years beginning in 1991 in an effort to prevent a selloff in the
distressed junk bond market. Lennon said that schedule shouldn't
force insurers to dump their holdings.
   ``I believe we're taking a very rational position,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   The recommendations would require insurers to set aside higher
reserves against some of their junk bond holdings to cover the risk
of possible losses. It also would shorten the length of time
companies can take to accumulate reserves.
   The Times said it wasn't clear if insurance companies would set
aside higher reserves to meet the guidelines or sell their
holdings. It estimated insurance company holdings at $50 billion to
$60 billion, or about a quarter of the $225 billion market.
   The junk bond market has been depressed in recent months in part
because of federal rules last year that required savings and loans
to sell their holdings by 1994. Defaults by several major issuers
and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which dominated
the issuing and trading of junk bonds, also have hurt the market.

<HEAD>Recap of Economic Reports and How Financial Markets Reacted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Government reports released Friday suggesting a weak U.S.
economy had an enormous impact on the financial markets, driving up
stocks and bonds but depressing the dollar. Here is a glance at
what happened:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Wholesale prices down</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department reported the sharpest drop in wholesale
prices since last August and economists decreed the inflation scare
over. The 0.3 percent drop was the second straight monthly decrease
in wholesale prices, which could translate into retail price
declines.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Retail sales down</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department said retail sales, a closely watched
statistic that reflects consumer confidence in the economy, fell
0.6 percent in April, the biggest setback in six months. Economists
said this raised the prospect of a further slowdown in months to
come and growing inventories of unsold goods.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Stocks and bonds soar</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Investors reacted gleefully to the economic news, snapping up
stocks and bonds on the theory that interest rates won't rise and
may even decline if the Federal Reserve believes it must loosen
credit to thwart a recession. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average
of 30 blue-chip stocks jumped 63.07 points, the biggest one-day
advance of 1990, putting the well-known barometer at 2,801.58, just
short of its 2,810.15 all-time high. Broader indexes also jumped in
heavy trading volume. In the bond market, a key barometer of the
economy and interest rates, the 30-year Treasury bond jumped nearly
$17.50 per $1,000 in face amount and its yield fell to 8.66
percent, vs. more than 9 percent just two weeks ago.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Dollar tumbles</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Money brokers dumped dollars on the belief that a weak U.S.
economy will translate into lower interest rates, which means
investments priced in dollars will be worth less. Instead they
snapped up Japanese yen and other foreign currencies. By the time
currency trading concluded late Friday in New York, the dollar had
partly recovered but remained sharply lower against the yen and
British pound.

   A record drop in vegetable costs contributed
to a second straight decline in wholesale prices last month, the
government said.
   The Labor Department said Friday its Producer Price Index for
finished goods fell a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent last month,
the sharpest decline since August and the third consecutive
moderate report.
   For the first four months of the year, inflation at the
wholesale level was running at a 4.2 percent annual rate, down from
4.8 percent for all of 1989.

to Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip industrial stocks finished

   Another big drop in auto demand contributed to
a 0.6 percent decline in retail sales in April, the biggest setback
in six months.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that sales fell to a
seasonally adjusted $148.64 billion last month after a 0.2 percent
decline in March.
   Private economists warned that the lackluster sales likely would
translate into slower economic growth in the months ahead as
businesses face growing inventories of unsold products.

   Leaders of top U.S. businesses said the
economy will grow only moderately this year and next but will
manage to stave off a recession.
   Inflation is on the way down, they said Friday, predicting that
the first-quarter annual inflation rate of 8.1 percent will be cut
nearly in half.
   Economic growth will total about 2 percent in 1990 as it
accelerates gradually from 1.9 percent in the first half of the
year to 2.3 percent in the second, according to the Business
Council, 100 chief executives of the nation's largest corporations.
Growth will rise to 2.6 percent in 1991.

   Amax Inc., the nation's third-largest coal
producer, has offered $1.25 billion to acquire industry leader
Peabody Holding Co., raising the possibility of a bidding war with
a major Peabody investor.
   The bid on Friday was rejected immediately by Hanson Industries,
which owns 45 percent of Peabody and is attempting to buy the rest.
Hanson responded by raising its offer for the Peabody shares it
doesn't own.
   The remaining 55 percent of St. Louis-based Peabody is owned by
Newmont Mining Corp. of Denver. Hanson, in turn, owns 49 percent of
Newmont.

   Stroh Brewery Co. wants to buy Heileman Brewing
Co. and form a new No. 3 beer maker, Stroh senior vice president
and chief legal officer George Kuehn says.
   But Heileman President Murray Cutbush replied Friday that he was
skeptical about joining with a company ``that has an absence of
strong senior management, an uncertain direction ... and an eroding
distributor network.''
   Stroh President Roger Fridholm told a business strategists'
group on Wednesday that Stroh still wanted to buy Heileman,
according to a story in The Detroit News that Kuehn confirmed
Friday.

<HEAD>Bolt Maker, Two Former Employees Plead Guilty In Inspection Fraud
Case</HEAD>

   The world's largest manufacturer of aircraft
bolts and fasteners pleaded guilty Friday to charges of conspiring
to falsify test reports on the parts and agreed to pay $18 million
in penalties and costs.
   Two former employees of the company, VSI Corp., also pleaded
guilty to one count each of conspiracy.
   The case, part of a continuing investigation into wrongdoing in
the aerospace industry, recovered the most money of any action
stemming from information received under the federal whistleblower
law, U.S. Attorney Mike McKay said.
   Under the law, three former VSI employees who complained about
the phony tests will be entitled to share at least $2.1 million,
McKay said.
   ``For at least 14 years, VSI intentionally deceived its
customers, including the U.S. government,'' McKay told a news
conference. ``VSI did this to cut corners and line its pockets.''
   Parts manufactured by VSI are used throughout the civilian and
military aircraft industry, with about half the company's products
sold to the government or defense contractors.
   McKay said the falsified reports covered millions of fasteners,
including some bought for the B-2, B-1 and B-52 bombers, C-5B
transport plane and F-18, F-15 and F-16 fighters.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder said the fasterners are used on
virtually every Boeing product, including civilian airliners.
   No accidents have been traced to faulty fasteners, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Carter, who prosecuted the case.
   Before U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein, VSI pleaded guilty
to three counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit
mail fraud, provide false statements to the government and defraud
the United States. The pleas were entered by company Vice President
Donald S. Parker.
   James E. Ryan, a former quality assurance manager at VSI's
Voi-Shan plant in Chatsworth, Calif., and Aram Marderian, a former
metallurgical laboratory supervisor for Voi-Shan, also pleaded
guilty to one count each of conspiracy.
   Rothstein set sentencing for Aug. 17. Ryan and Marderian, both
of whom have agreed to cooperate in further government
investigations, each face up to five years in prison and up to
$250,000 in fines.
   As part of the plea agreement, VSI agreed to pay a fine of $2.5
million and the estimated $1 million for the costs of the
investigation.
   To resolve a separate civil whistleblower case, VSI will make an
additional payment of $14.5 million. The three whistleblowers will
share 15 percent to 25 percent of that, McKay said.
   VSI, a subsidiary of Fairchild Industries Inc., and Ryan and
Marderian were charged Wednesday.
   The government alleged that from 1975 or earlier to February
1989, some required tests were omitted, test results were altered,
parts were reworked in violation of specifications and falsified
reports were given by VSI to Boeing, Northrop, McDonnell Douglas,
Lockheed, General Electric, Pratt &amp; Whitney, the Defense Department
and other customers.
   The stamp of a fictitious ``Inspector 11'' was used to indicate
that some tests had been completed successfully, the complaint said.
   Some bolts that failed tests were delivered with documents
indicating they met specifications, and other required tests
weren't performed, the complaint said. In other instances, tests
were performed on fewer parts than required.
   The mail fraud charges involved phony test results provided to
Boeing at Seattle and Wichita, Kan., General Dynamics in Fort
Worth, Texas, and Northrop in Los Angeles, Carter said.
   VSI will cooperate fully with the government and wants ``to put
all this behind it,'' Parker said.
   ``If anyone out there is not identified as a wrongdoer, we're
going to cooperate to bring them to justice,'' he said.
   Parker said senior management at the company didn't find out
about the fraud until February 1989, when federal agents raided the
Voi-Shan plant.
   But Lawrence Finegold, an attorney for Ryan, said his client had
been following an ``inherited practice'' that had gone on for years.
   Carter said evidence in the case indicated ``quality control
fraud really was a way of life'' at the Chatsworth plant.
   The probe was triggered by a complaint from whistleblower Tom
Runion shortly after he left his job in the metallurgical
laboratory at the Chatsworth facility, Carter said. Runion and two
others are plaintiffs in the whistleblower suit that was unsealed
Friday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Carter said.
   He said inadequate Voi-Shan parts were found during aircraft
assembly and installation and were returned to the manufacturer but
investigators do not know whether there have been any imminent
safety threats.
   Investigators learned that of the government and civilian buyers
of Voi-Shan fasteners, Boeing and Northrop Corp. especially had
been rejecting substantial deliveries after doing their own tests.
   Boeing said it has inspected and tested the fasteners, and
retested certain lots of materials. It said Voi-Shan materials met
all Boeing specifications and requirements and use of them ``has
not compromised the integrity of Boeing products.''

<HEAD>Amax Bids For Peabody Coal; Hanson Increases Offer In Response</HEAD>

   Amax Inc., the nation's third-largest coal
producer, made a $1.25 billion offer Friday for industry leader
Peabody Holding Co., raising the possibility of a bidding war with
a major Peabody investor.
   he bid was rejected immediately by Hanson Industries, which owns
45 percent of Peabody and is attempting to buy the rest. Hanson
responded by raising its offer for the Peabody shares it doesn't
own.
   The remaining 55 percent of St. Louis-based Peabody is owned by
Newmont Mining Corp. of Denver. Hanson, in turn, owns 49 percent of
Newmont.
   Hanson in March offered to buy Newmont's stake in Peabody for
$715 million. But under terms of the sale agreement between Hanson
and Newmont, the companies agreed to consider outside bids for all
of Peabody until the deal with Hanson closed.
   Closing tentatively was scheduled for sometime next month, said
Newmont spokesman James Hill.
   After New York-based Amax disclosed its bid Friday, Hanson
immediately increased its offer for Newmont's Peabody stake to
$725.6 million. That tops the $718.5 million that Newmont's stake
is worth under the Amax offer, Hanson said.
   Hill said Newmont's agreement to sell its Peabody stake to
Hanson remained in effect but that the Amax bid started an auction
process for Peabody.
   ``It is to ensure that the highest bidder gets it,'' he said.
   Hanson, the U.S. arm of Britain's Hanson PLC conglomerate,
acquired its Peabody stake in February for about $504 million from
Boeing Co., Bechtel Investments Inc. and the energy company Eastern
Enterprises.
   ``Although their (Amax's) bid would benefit Hanson by providing
a premium for the stake which we already own, we are determined to
complete our acquisition of Peabody,'' said Sir Gordon White,
chairman of Hanson Industries.
   Hanson Industries acquired its 49 percent stake in Newmont
through its purchase of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, the British
gold mining company, in 1989.
   Amax, which also is a major aluminum producer, has said for some
time that it plans to increase its coal holdings, said spokesman
Mitchell Badler.
   He said Peabody would help boost Amax's already substantial
reserves in low-sulfur coal, which is in demand because it pollutes
less than high-sulfur varieties.
   ``We thought it was a good fit,'' he said.
   He said Amax envisioned no antitrust concerns in its bid because
of the fragmented nature of the coal industry. An Amax-Peabody
combination would control less than 12 percent of the nation's coal
production, he said.
   Badler said he did not know whether Amax would increase its bid
in light of Hanson raising its offer.
   Newmont decided to put Peabody up for sale after it failed to
carry out a restructuring of the coal company, Hill said.
   Newmont took on a heavy debt load in 1987 after it paid out a
special $2.2 billion dividend to shareholders to avoid a takeover
from T. Boone Pickens. It has been selling assets to reduce the
debt, and also planned to have Peabody issue junk bonds and pass
along some of the proceeds to Newmont, Hill said.
   But that plan fell through when the junk bond market went sour
last year, he said.
   In consolidated trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange,
Hanson PLC's American Depositary Receipts rose 62{ cents to
$18.87{, Newmont shares rose 62{ cents to $46 and Amax shares fell
12{ cents to $25.25.
