<TEXT>
   Federal investigators found ``slight
indications'' of rail movement Tuesday where an Amtrak passenger
train derailed, and the fireman at the controls felt the 16-car
train drag moments before it crashed.
   Investigators said the train apparently was traveling within the
speed limit when eight cars left the tracks Monday afternoon,
injuring 95.
   About a dozen people remained hospitalized Tuesday. There were
no deaths.
   Amtrak's California Zephyr with 396 passengers and a crew of 24
was headed to Chicago from the West Coast when it derailed in
southeastern Iowa on track owned by the Burlington Northern
Railroad. The number of passengers and injured was revised from
Monday.
   Susan Coughlin, vice-chairwoman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, said investigators discovered ``slight indications''
of rail movement, either from lack of ballast or wet soil, as the
train entered a crossing grade at Batavia. She declined to draw any
conclusions.
   ``They are looking for evidence of movement in the track
structure,'' Ms. Coughlin said at a news conference. ``We are not
in a position at this point to interpret any of the findings.''
   She said a fireman who also was a qualified engineer was at the
controls when the train derailed, which ``is not an abnormal
situation at all.''
   ``The fireman who was operating as the engineer felt the train
drag. Up to that point, they detected nothing abnormal in the
performance of the train.
   ``He looked back and saw that the rear cars were swaying. He put
his train then into an emergency braking,'' she said.
   Ms. Coughlin declined to say whether the braking action was the
correct procedure, or if it saved lives and kept injuries to a
minimum.
   An eight-member team from the NTSB is leading the investigation,
which involves about 40 officials from the Federal Railroad
Administration, the Iowa Department of Transportation, Amtrak, the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Burlington Northern.
   The 24-member crew, including a conductor, two assistant
conductors, an engineer and the fireman, was tested for drug and
alcohol use and those results were expected in about two days, she
said.
   The NTSB will concentrate its efforts Wednesday to a switching
device in Batavia and a 1,240-foot stretch of track from where the
train passed the grade crossing to where it derailed, she said.
   Behind the investigators, crews went to work on the twisted rail
and gouged right-of-way in this town of 525 people, 90 miles
southeast of Des Moines. The double-track route was not expected to
be reopened until late Wednesday.
   Ms. Coughlin the crash caused $1.7 million damage to the train
and $75,000 to the track.
   The damaged cars were taken to Fairfield, about 15 miles east of
Batavia, for inspection and repair. The three locomotives and eight
other undamaged cars headed east to Chicago.
   Amtrak and American Red Cross representatives loaded two buses
with about 40 passengers who stayed overnight in Ottumwa, about 10
miles west of Batavia, and sent them to Chicago. Carol Grant, field
service manager for the Red Cross, said those were the last of the
passengers who were aboard the Zephyr.
   At Jefferson County Hospital in Fairfield, a spokeswoman said
two of the nine patients admitted overnight were released Tuesday
morning. The remaining patients were all in good, stable condition.
   Skip Deskin, vice president of Ottumwa Regional Medical Center,
said at least three of the nine patients who stayed overnight were
discharged Tuesday morning with more expected to be released soon.

<TEXT>
   The United States curtailed spy flights
focused on Colombian drug traffickers after allegations that a U.S.
aircraft nearly collided with two Colombian planes, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
   The Defense Department scaled back the program under pressure
from the Colombian government, which had approved the missions on
condition they be kept secret, the Los Angeles Times reported,
citing unidentified sources.
   Information from the spy flights has been used in a Colombian
manhunt for Pablo Escobar, the reputed head of the Medellin cocaine
cartel, the Times said.
   The alleged near-collisions became public in Colombia on March
29 when the pilot of an SAM airliner was quoted by newspapers as
saying the military aircraft had passed within several hundred feet
of his plane over southern Colombia. Sociedad Aerea Medellinense, a
subsidiary of Avianca, normally flies domestic routes and to
Central America.
   The Pentagon has said that a Panama-based Air Force EC-130
flying at 18,500 feet had been in the area on March 28, but denied
that a near-collision had occurred.
   A spokeswoman for the U.S Embassy in Bogota, Lauren Hale, on
Tuesday told The Associated Press that the only U.S government
flights in Colombia had been to practice search and rescue missions
with the approval of the Colombian government.
   She said the United States decided to suspend the flights to
prevent any further misinformation.
   Unidentified sources told the Times that the EC-130, a variation
of the C-130 cargo plane that carries electronic surveillance
equipment, is based at Howard Air Base outside Panama City.
   Bush administration officials said they believe the U.S. pilot
erred by allowing his plane to be spotted. But they said the
alleged near-collision may have been conceived by Colombians
sympathetic to the drug traffickers, according to the newspaper.
   The Pentagon has since ordered its spy plane pilots to avoid
detection over Colombia. One official said it was possible the
pilots may have to stay out of Colombian airspace altogether.
   The orders are believed to affect the operations of
Oklahoma-based Air Force AWACS radar planes that monitor air
traffic over Colombia and attempts by the Panama-based EC-130s to
pick up communications among drug traffickers.
   Administration officials said the cutback could hurt
intelligence gathering but that they were determined to maintain
cooperation with Colombian authorities in the drug war.
   ``There will be a limit on what we can do, but the bottom line
in the long run is that we have to work with the Colombians,'' one
source told the newspaper.

   President-elect Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro takes office Wednesday already facing division in the
ranks of her victorious coalition over government posts and
treatment of Nicaragua's outgoing Sandinistas.
   A source said late Tuesday one of those outgoing Sandinistas,
Gen. Humberto Ortega, President Daniel Ortega's brother, will
remain in charge of the army but answer to Mrs. Chamorro, who as
both defense minister and president will be supreme commander of
the armed forces.
   ``There are some extremists who want the Sandinistas wiped out
in one fell swoop,'' the source close to Mrs. Chamorro said,
describing some factions in the United National Opposition. ``That
can't be. He (Ortega) will be eased out, but not for a while.''
   Keeping on Gen. Ortega as army commander likely will heighten
divisions inside Mrs. Chamorro's ruling coalition and make it more
difficult for her to persuade the U.S.-backed Contra rebels to
disarm. Contras and members of her coalition have demanded
Sandinista loyalists be purged from the army.
   Meanwhile in a show of support for the new administration,
congressional and administration sources in Washington said Tuesday
that President Bush will invoke emergency authority to send $2.6
million in medical aid in time for Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration.
   The maneuver gives Vice President Dan Quayle the chance to
deliver the good news as the United States' top representative at
the swearing-in ceremony, scheduled for 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday.
   UNO faces a test of unity in the National Assembly while cabinet
appointees, due to be sworn in shortly after Mrs. Chamorro's
inauguration, have yet to be officially announced.
   The 14-party coalition brought together everyone from communists
to conservatives in the successful effort to oust President
Ortega's Sandinistas, in power since 1979.
   The first test came Tuesday afternoon, when the new National
Assembly met to elect a president. UNO's official choice is Myriam
Arguello, a 64-year-old lawyer from the People's Conservative
Alliance.
   Ms. Arguello earlier received 28 votes at a caucus of UNO's 51
deputies, to 23 for Alfredo Cesar, a close adviser to Mrs.
Chamorro, a former member of the Contra rebels' directorate and a
man with his sights set on running for president in the 1996
elections.
   Ms. Arguello is backed by Vice-President elect Virgilio Godoy,
and the Sandinistas have hinted their 39 deputies might vote for
Cesar to encourage a split in UNO ranks, even though Cesar is not a
Sandinista favorite because of his Contra connections.
   The legislature's opening session began as scheduled at 4 p.m.,
a noteworthy event that marked a new era in Nicaraguan politics.
   Daneil Ortega, who has an assembly seat as a presidential
candidate, sent a message to Mariano Fiallos, the Supreme Electoral
Council president, who presided over the first assembly until they
chose a president, saying he would not be able to attend the
legislative sessions until further notice.
   Lame-duck Vice President Sergio Ramirez, who is Ortega's
alternate, is expected to fill the role of minority assembly leader.
   Ms. Arguello was officially nominated for the presidency.
However, a Sandinista deputy made a motion for a secret vote. A
debate over the secret vote motion followed but the assembly went
into recess late Tuesday.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who showed up 20 minutes after the session began
and left after all the deputies got their credentials, got a
standing ovation from both sides of the aisle when she arrived and
again when she left.
   Barricada, official newspaper of the Sandinista Front, ran an
editorial Tuesday saying the Sandinistas would of necessity play a
critical role in the emerging political landscape in this nation of
3.5 million residents.
   ``The Sandinista Front, although it is not part of the new
government, and placing itself strictly within the terrain of a
committed opposition, cannot renounce playing the role of a
national arbiter and a decisive force in the crisis from which the
new government emerges,'' the editorial said.
   Many in UNO's political council, which represents the 14
parties, consider Cesar an opportunist. They fired him as campaign
manager when both he and Mrs. Chamorro were out of the country six
months ago.
   As soon as Mrs. Chamorro returned, she named Cesar her personal
adviser.
   News on Gen. Ortega wasn't entirely unexpected. La Prensa, the
Chamorro family newspaper, said Monday the president-elect would
probably assume the defense ministry herself to avoid upsetting the
UNO council and high echelons of the Sandinista People's Army.
   Mrs. Chamorro's advisers have signed an agreement with the
Sandinistas that would depoliticize the Sandinista army. On Monday
the Sandinistas announced army officers were stepping down from
party posts; that included Humberto Ortega, one of nine members of
the Sandinista directorate.
   Radio Corporacion, a pro-UNO radio station, broadcast a call-in
show Tuesday with citizens saying ``the electorate voted for a
total change'' and ``all Sandinistas must go.''
   Many of the thousands of armed Contras in the countryside also
maintain that position, and say they will not disarm as agreed by
June 10 unless the army is purged.
   Meanwhile, President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela arrived
Tuesday in Managua for the inauguration. Other heads of state
expected include presidents Oscar Arias of Costa Rica; Alfredo
Cristiani of El Salvador; Guilio Andreotti of Italy; and Guillermo
Endara of Panama.

   Here is a brief review of the Chernobyl nuclear
accident and its aftermath:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ACCIDENT _ On April 26, 1986, a fire started in one of the
four 1,000-megawatt reactors of the nuclear power station at
Chernobyl, 80 miles north of Kiev, captial of the Ukraine. A core
meltdown and explosion followed, sending huge quantities of
radiation into the atmosphere. The Soviets did not report the
accident until two days later, after Scandinavian complaints of
unsually high radiation levels.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EVACUATION _ About 116,000 people were evacuated from
contaminated parts of the Ukraine and Byelorussia, most from a
9-mile radius of the plant. A pass is required to enter the area.
Last year, the government decided to evacuate 85 more villages in
Byelorussia, 31 in Russia and 14 in the Ukrain.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DEATHS _ Two people were killed in the accident and 29 are
officially reported to have died of radiation sickness later. Yuri
Scherbak, a Ukrainian member of the national parliament, and others
say up to 250 have died. An official report commissioned in 1986
estimated 5,300 people would die over 70 years from cancer
resulting from radiation exposure.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   COST _ Current estimates of cleanup costs are 30 times the
original $8 billion rubles ($13 billion at the official exchange
rate). Surveys by the three republics affected indicate the cost
may reach 250 billion rubles ($405 billion) over the next decade.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PLANS FOR CHERNOBYL _ The Ukrainian legislature decided this
year that the plant, whose other three reactors are still
functioning, should be closed by 1995. Specialists say shutting it
down may take up to 10 years.

<HEAD>Crime Increasing in Taiwan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two thieves shot Yeh Yung-chuan to death,
in front of other investors, as he left the trading floor of a
brokerage house with nearly $100,000. Crime has come to Taiwan on
the heels of affluence.
   Yeh, a 32-year-old accountant, turned to run when the men
stopped him. They shot him once in the back and once in the head,
took his 2.5 million Taiwan dollars and fled on a motorcycle parked
outside.
   Such brutal crimes are becoming common. Wealthy businessmen hire
guards and use bulletproof cars.
   ``Taiwan is not safe anymore,'' said Rebecca Yen, a 28-year-old
employee of a trading company. ``Most of my friends plan to
emigrate.''
   Increased violence stems from a get-rich-quick mentality on this
island of 20 million people, abetted by guns smuggled from mainland
China, officials say.
   Police said a record 5,839 cases of violent crime were reported
last year and they confiscated 9,770 firearms, more than the total
of the previous five years. Robberies increased 39 percent and
kidnappings 53 percent from 1988, they said..
   ``Violent crime has jeopardized our social stability,'' said Jaw
Shau-kong, a popular legislator who wore a bulletproof vest in his
December election campaign. ``We don't feel as secure as before.''
   President Lee Teng-hui acknowledged increasing crime ``has had a
grave impact on social stability and the people's confidence in the
nation.''
   One-third of entrepreneurs responding to an Economics Ministry
survey said they had been targets of harassment or extortion by
gangsters.
   Last year, Taiwan's richest shipping company executive paid
nearly $2 million ransom for his kidnapped 32-year-old son, who was
released unharmed. Police later arrested three suspects and
retrieved the money.
   Many of the 145 kidnappings reported last year ended tragically.
Captors killed several victims after ransom was paid.
   Four masked men armed with Israeli-made Uzi machine guns shot up
Ho Cheng Securities in Changhwa, central Taiwan, in March,
apparently because the company did not pay $1.2 million in
extortion money.
   ``I don't think we can do any business when our lives and
property are unprotected,'' said Kao Ching-yuan, a Taiwan business
leader. ``It may be safer to move our business abroad.''
   Emigration appears to be growing along with the crime statistics.
   ``Thanks to soaring crime, our business doubled last year,''
said C.C. Tai of Domini International Consulting Corp., which helps
people emigrate to Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
   Tai estimated that about 40,000 Taiwanese left in 1989, up from
30,000 in 1988.
   Luxury cars, seen as invitations to kidnapping and robbery, no
longer are in demand.
   Eric Fang, assistant sales manager of the largest Mercedes-Benz
agency, said his company sold only 290 cars in December, down from
the 1988 monthly average of 650, and predicted a drop in sales of
15 percent for 1990.
   ``Many businessmen have postponed purchases because they do not
want to drive the `dangerous cars','' he said.
   Authorities report a dramatic increase in smuggled guns from
China. Police said they seized 687 Chinese-made shotguns last year,
up from 57 in 1988.
   Official statistics say smuggled Chinese guns were used in 91
killings in 1987, including those of four policemen.
   Premier Lee Huan has proclaimed 1990 ``Anti-Crime Year'' and
proposed that gun possession, now punishable by 10 years in prison,
be made a capital crime.
   Thousands of inexpensive guns are believed to be in the hands of
gangsters. Some legislators say the only way to stop the influx
from the mainland is for the government to hold direct talks with
Beijing.
   The ruling Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war to the Communists, and still refuse to negotiate directly
with the Beijing government.
   Lin Chia-cheng, a sociology professor at Soochow University,
believes one reason for the crime wave is ``the widened gap between
the rich and the poor.''
   Taiwan's export-led economic boom has made its per capita gross
national product the fourth highest in Asia, but good fortune has
not been shared equally. The income of the top 20 percent is nearly
five times that of the bottom 20 percent.
   People also seem more inclined to seek quick riches than to work
for a better life. Stock speculation has been the favored tactic,
but many have turned to crime.
   ``Traditional values have faded,'' Lin said. ``Fewer people
believe in hard work and saving. Most envy those who have gotten
wealthy fast from speculating, and some think it is all right to
get money from those rich people.''

   Art came to life at the Paradiso
nightclub as this year's Amsterdam Tattoo Convention got under way,
with the only inhibition in evidence a growing concern about AIDS.
   Swarms of male and female tattoo-bearers, some half-naked to
show off their intricate body art, clustered around tattoo artists
creating fire-breathing dragons and Indian chiefs on their living
canvases.
   The convention drew tattooers, tattoo-wearers, camera-bearing
voyeurs and the just-curious from around the world, with one Samoan
pricking his customer with traditional parallel line motifs from
his South Pacific homeland.
   The convention, which opened Monday, is the third organized in
the last decade in this tourist Mecca by the 55-member Dutch Union
of Tattooers, whose president, Henk Schiffmacher, runs the
Amsterdam Tattoo Museum.
   ``Usually tattoo enthusiasts can only get together in small
groups. This is mainly a social event,'' said Schiffmacher, whose
tattoos poured out of his modest T-shirt.
   By contrast, 47-year-old Isobel Varley of Hertfordshire,
England, posed topless with Jack Yount Jr., 63, of Crystal Springs,
Fla., to give onlookers a better view of their scenic torsos.
   The more modest wore bathing suits to show as much as possible.
   The convention also provided a stage for devotees of more exotic
forms of jewelry like nose rings.
   Yount, who wears silver horns through his nose, runs Silver
Anchor Enterprises, specializing in ``Exotic Body Jewelry'' and
``Piercing by Appointment,'' according to his business card.
   But taking center-stage were tattoos, designs made by puncturing
the skin with a needle and inserting indelible pigment.
   Despite the number of people who opted to get tattoos in the
dozens of booths at the convention, the sound was of conversation
and cameras clicking, not gasps of pain.
   ``It's a matter of meditating to bear the pain,'' said
Schiffmacher, 38. An increased awareness of AIDS was apparent among
the practitioners and devotees of the sometimes bloody art painted
with needles.
   Containers of sterilized needles at each tattoo artist's booth
evinced the Amsterdam Health Department's toughened safety
requirements since the last show three years ago.
   Every tattooist was required to wear gloves and use a freshly
sterilized needle on each new client. Convention organizers
provided sterilization facilities.
   ``The safety precautions are stricter than ever,'' said
tattooist John Hus, adding that the municipal health authority was
conducting regular checks at the convention.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is transmitted via the
exchange of infected blood. The fatal disease attacks the body's
immune system, leaving it susceptible to cancers and other
infections.

   Intruders broke into the Soviet trade
office, yanked drawers out of desks and scattered documents on the
floor, officials and news reports said today.
   Staff members at the Soviet trade office and its adjoining
consular department office discovered the break-in shortly after 9
a.m. Monday as they arrived for work, said the Chosun-Ilbo
newspaper.
   The lock on the office's front door was ripped off, drawers were
pulled out and documents scattered on the floor, it said.
   A Soviet representative, requesting anonymity, confirmed the
break-in and said today that ``at first glance'' nothing appeared
to have been removed from the office. He said there was no serious
damage to the premises.
   The Soviet Union and South Korea agreed to exchange consular
departments in each other's capitals in December. The Soviet trade
office had opened several months earlier.
   South Korea's governing party has said it hopes to establish
formal diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union by the end of the year.

<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syria, long portrayed as the ogre in
Lebanon and the godfather of terrorist groups, is making a
high-profile effort to free American hostages and to improve its
relations with the West.
   The Syrians clearly played a key role in securing the release of
U.S. hostage Robert Polhill on Sunday, 39 months after he was
kidnapped in Lebanon by Shiite Moslem militants.
   Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, Syria's point man in the
campaign to free the Westerners held in Lebanon, said: ``I'm sure
his release will pave the way for the release of the rest of the
hostages.''
   Seventeen Westerners, seven of them Americans, remain in
captivity, most of them held by Shiite extremists in Lebanon.
   Sharaa staked his reputation on the tug-of-war between the U.S.
government and the Iranian-backed Shiites that led to Polhill's
release.
   When the kidnappers postponed the release because Washington
would not send a senior envoy to negotiate, Sharaa said the hostage
would appear Sunday.
   Polhill was turned over to U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian as
scheduled.
   Syria's actions are part of a foreign policy strategy to move
back into the Arab mainstream after years of radical isolation and
to seek better economic ties with the West.
   Syria's relationship with its traditional backer, the Soviet
Union, is changing as Moscow pursues detente and reforms at home,
leaving it little choice but to trim its sails to the winds of
moderation.
   The Syrians clearly hope to improve their image in the West by
being seen as the saviors of the hostages.
   In return, Syria hopes to be taken off the U.S. list of states
that Washington says sponsor terrorism and to reap the political
and economic benefits from Western countries who have shunned
Damascus in recent years.
   Countries on that list are denied U.S. aid and credit.
   Diplomats said that getting off the U.S. terror list would
provide a much-needed tonic for Syria's beleaguered economy and
provide political respectability to President Hafez Assad's
government in Western eyes.
   Damascus would like to purchase everything from high-tech
computers to wheat from the United States at less-than-commercial
rates.
   Improved relations would also ensure that Syria's voice is heard
at any U.S.-sponsored Middle East peace talks.
   Toward that end, Assad reestablished ties with Egypt in December
to end a lengthy rift over Cairo's 1979 peace treaty with Israel.
   The United States and Syria have already reached agreement on
trying to bring peace to Lebanon, with both supporting the accord
reached by Lebanese parliamentarians in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in
October.
   The accord, which outlines a gradual withdrawal of Syria's
40,000 troops from Lebanon, still gives Damascus an important role
in the affairs of its war-shattered neighbor.
   It is that influence that allowed Syria to play the role of
mediator between Iran and the United States on the hostage issue.
Arab news reports have said that Assad hinged a state visit to
Tehran on hostage releases.
   Syria was Iran's main Arab ally during Iran's 1980-88 war with
Iraq, Syria's main rival in the Arab world.
   Iran depends on Syria for access for its Revolutionary Guards to
Lebanon, the only place outside the Islamic republic where the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Shiite revolution has taken hold.
   Syria is the dominant military power in Lebanon. Its troops are
deployed in three-quarters of the country.
   So far, it has not overtly used that muscle to force the Shiite
militants to hand over hostages, apparently seeking to avoid an
open confrontation with Iran's proxies that could ignite a wider
conflict in Lebanon.
   The Syrians have played a role in securing the release of
hostages in the past because of their ties with Tehran.
   But their influence has increased since Hashemi Rafsanjani,
leader of Tehran's so-called pragmatists who also seek improved
ties with the West, became Iran's president in July.
   Rafsanjani's power struggle with Tehran's anti-Western radicals
has been mirrored in a rift among the Lebanese Shiites, and it was
Syria's ability to exploit that which apparently played an
important part in Polhill's release.
   There has been little American goodwill toward Syria in the last
few years.
   Washington recalled its ambassador to Damascus in 1986 after
Britain broke relations with Syria, accusing Syrian intelligence of
sponsoring a plot to smuggle a bomb aboard an Israeli airliner in
London.
   Assad eventually expelled the Palestinian group led by terrorist
mastermind Abu Nidal which was linked to the abortive bombing and
other attacks.
   Washington recently pressured Assad to expel Ahmed Jibril,
leader of the Damascus-based Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   Western Intelligence agencies list the group as the prime
suspect in the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Scotland in 1988
that killed 270 people.
   Assad said he would act if positive proof of involvement in the
Pan Am bombing was provided.
   ``Maybe the United States would overlook Jibril's presence if
Syria helps get the hostages out,'' a Western diplomat speculated.

   Dean Kahler has only to look down to remember that day. A rifle
bullet made him a paraplegic and put him in a wheelchair for life.
   ``I know why I'm sitting in it,'' Kahler said. ``I'll never
really forget Kent State.''
   Kahler, then a 20-year-old freshman from Canton, Ohio, had
worked nearly a year in a steel mill to help pay for school. When
rifle fire crackled over the shouts of his fellow students, he fell
to the ground to take cover. He felt a sensation like a bee sting;
it was a bullet ripping into his spinal cord.
   Kahler, a conscientious objector, was the most seriously injured
of the nine persons wounded. He finished school seven years later
then built a career in state government, working for the secretary
of state and attorney general. He was elected an Athens County
commissioner in 1984 and re-elected four years later.
   Kahler, divorced in 1984, married a counselor he met in a pub
last August. He frequently drives the 340-mile round trip to Kent
State for sports and alumni events. He is a guest lecturer for a
regularly offered course that examines the Kent State shootings and
their aftermath.
   ``Kent State is not something I carry around as a burden,'' he
said. ``Just because I had one bad day at Kent doesn't mean the
whole university should be condemned. ... To me what's more
important is the county budget ... and my family and the rest of my
life.''
   But for Sarah and Martin Scheuer, much of their life died in a
13-second volley of gunfire.
   ``It ruined our lives,'' said Scheuer, now 79 and suffering from
Parkinson's disease.
   As the seasons come and go, so do May 4 wedding anniversaries _
unmarked, uncelebrated. Nor can Mrs. Scheuer bear the fragrance of
springtime lilacs.
   ``I'd like to bring them all inside. I love them all so much,''
Sandy told her mother when Mrs. Scheuer visited her apartment two
days before she died. Those were the last words her mother ever
heard her speak.
   ``I try not to look at them,'' said Mrs. Scheuer. ``It just
makes me feel sad.''

   That craggy, silver-haired, enigmatic sleuth
played by John Thaw is coming back to PBS' ``Mystery!'' for another
go at solving brainy murders in the academic confines of Oxford,
England.
   ``Inspector Morse,'' an Oxfordshire detective with a passion for
puzzles, returns for a third season on Thursday, May 3.
   This is the 10th year for ``Mystery!,'' which is hosted by Diana
Rigg and presents such characters as John Mortimer's ``Rumpole of
the Bailey,'' Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, P.D. James' Adam
Dalgliesh and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.
   The ``Inspector Morse'' series opens with the two-part mystery,
``The Settling of the Sun,'' in which Morse and Sgt. Lewis (Kevin
Whately) of the Thames Valley Police solve a revenge killing
involving a group of foreign students attending summer school at
Oxford.
   Created by Colin Dexter, the character of Morse is harder to pin
down than the crimes he compulsively tackles. Morse is a detective
who leaps to conclusions, very often the wrong ones, but always is
put back on the right path with the help of plodding Sgt. Lewis.
   ``He's a bachelor, while Lewis has a young family,'' said Thaw,
an English actor who was on a brief visit to this country. ``At the
end of the day, Lewis is anxious to get home when he's off the
clock. Morse would work a 24-hour day. Morse doesn't treat him too
kindly. He thinks he should put being a detective first. It's not a
buddy-buddy relationship.
   ``The relationship's not like Holmes and Watson, where Watson
will come up with something that will change the whole case. Morse
leaps from one theory to another and comes to the wrong conclusion
at first. Lewis could come up with something obvious that gets him
back on track.''
   Morse lives alone and, apart from police work, is devoted to
music, crossword puzzles and drinking beer. Thaw calls him ``a sad
man in a lot of ways.''
   The English-made series, funded by Mobil, is filmed in Oxford,
around the colleges and the Thames River. It's done entirely on
location, with no studio work. Later this year, the show will film
in Australia, where Morse gets sent on a case.
   ``Most of the murders are committed by someone who's a friend,''
Thaw said. ``There are no gangs or criminals _ mostly just
old-fashioned murders that Sherlock Holmes was solving at the turn
of the century.
   ``We're beginning to get out of the colleges,'' he said. ``I
thought it was silly to have all the murders at Oxford University.
I said I didn't want my daughter to go to Oxford if they had that
many murders.''
   The series is based on the novels by Dexter, who also was a
leading creator of crossword puzzles. He named his detective, whose
first name never is mentioned, after Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of
Lloyds Bank and a friend who's also a crossword addict.
   The episodes all are from Dexter's novels or from stories he has
outlined for the script writers.
   In the May 17-24 episode, the inspector investigates the
disappearance of some valuable erotic paintings. Patricia Hodge,
who stars as Phyllida Erskine-Brown on ``Rumpole of the Bailey,''
is the guest star.
   The series concludes May 31-June 7 when Morse and Lewis look
into deceit, corruption and ruthless ambition among the Oxford dons.
   Thaw, who co-starred with Glenda Jackson in ``Business as
Usual'' and also appeared in ``Cry Freedom,'' often is seen on
English police shows. He played a peg-legged villain in one of the
``Sherlock Holmes'' stories.
   ``Between series, I usually go back on stage,'' he said.
   He met his wife, actress Sheila Hancock, when they co-starred in
``So What About Love'' in London's West End. They have three
daughters, one of whom is studying drama at the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Arts.

   Aside from ketchup-splattered death
threats, this town that serves as the setting for the slightly
surreal ``Twin Peaks'' TV series could hardly be more ordinary.
   Nothing could be further from Snoqualmie's real life than the
hot new television series in which teen-age drug dealers,
obsessive-compulsive housewives, Satanic cultists and others figure
in the murder of a cocaine-crazed homecoming queen.
   ``I think you can describe this better as Mayberry,'' the quiet
town in the old ``Andy Griffith Show,'' said Baldwin Galloway,
opening Smokey Joe's Tavern for the day. ``It's a pretty ho-hum
town.''
   Snoqualmie, pronounced snow-KWAL-mee, a logging and tourist town
of about 1,500 residents 30 miles east of Seattle in the foothills
of the Cascade Mountains, was the location for filming ``Twin
Peaks'' and some locals got jobs as extras.
   Local reaction to the ABC series has been mixed.
   ``I love it, the whole thing, all the weird people, the straight
people and all,'' said Janine Simmons, tending the cash register at
Big Edd's drive-in.
   ``I don't know any weird people, and I've been here 26 years,''
she said. ``We're just having a lot of fun with it.''
   ``Everyone just kind of laughs about it,'' said Rita Lessard,
48, helping to arrange a display case at Dave's Jewelry.
   ``I haven't talked with anyone that thinks it's just
wonderful,'' she said. ``I can't believe it's getting good ratings.
The acting is horrid.''
   Jean Priestman, 43, director of Good Neighbor Child Care at the
Methodist Community Church, was undecided.
   ``At first I thought it was a murder mystery. Then somebody told
me it was a comedy,'' she said.
   In real life, police are trying to identify the source of death
threats against town council members who support Weyerhaeuser Co.
plans for a 2,000-home development.
   Investigators said the worst threat was last month against
council member Colleen Johnson.
   Draped over her car was a bedsheet with threats like, ``Wear
your vest,'' a reference to the bulletproof vest she wears when
working as a reserve police officer. Also on the sheet was a sketch
of Mount Si with ketchup dripping from it, and a trail of ketchup
led from the car to her front door.
   In general, however, ``it's a sleepy little town,'' said Barbara
Harkey, assistant principal at Mount Si High School.
   Ed Lamb, 48, a barber and lifelong resident who charges $8 for
adults, $7 for youngsters under 12 and seniors, and $3.50 for beard
trims, said the first sign of notoriety for the town was a
supermarket tabloid article that suggested it was infested with
chain saw-dueling maniacs. The article was illustrated with a
photograph of neighboring North Bend.
   Lamb, a volunteer firefighter for 28 years, and others said they
had never heard of anyone running amok with a chain saw.
   Before long, however, a sign outside Big Edd's said, ``Please
check your chainsaws in before entering'' on one side and ``Twin
Peaks Burger $2.85 Little Leaguers Welcome'' on the other.
   Next door, at Valley Saw &amp; Lawn Center, the sign said: ``Buy
your duelin chainsaws here!''
   Aside from chain saw jokes, residents say little has changed or
is likely to change.
   Bookings have remained steady at the Salish Lodge near the top
of the 268-foot Snoqualmie Falls, a 91-room establishment that
appears as a trysting place and scene of low intrigue in the
series, said general manager Loy Helmly.
   There are no plans to use ``Twin Peaks'' in a marketing
campaign, said assistant manager Stan Kott.
   ``We are thinking about having Thursday night parties to watch
the show,'' Kott said, ``but that's fairly low-key, something more
for the locals.''

<HEAD>Dominating The Dial In Post-Revolutionary Nicaragua</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dominating the dial is a key element
of the Sandinista game plan for post-revolutionary Nicaragua.
   The Sandinistas have gutted the state-run radio network rather
than turn the stations over to the conservative government that
takes over Wednesday.
   They have also broken up their government-owned network of 16
advertising and publicity firms.
   For the most part, the radio stations and the publicity firms
are now in the hands of Sandinista loyalists.
   Party loyalists have also been given licenses for the first
private television since the 1979 revolution.
   Members of the United National Opposition transition team and
the pre-revolutionary owners of the radio stations are indignant.
   So is Nicaragua's only opposition paper, La Prensa, which is
published by President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. La Prensa
says the Sandinistas are trying ``to leave intact their enormous
propaganda apparatus.''
   When the Sandinistas were the state, they believed in state
ownership and firm control of the mass media. The 17-station radio
network and the chain of advertising firms were assembled from
confiscated companies.
   Under Sandinista rule, Nicaragua has had only two TV stations,
both of which are state-run and are to be turned over to the new
administration.
   The Sandinistas also censored the media, closing La Prensa
often, sometimes for months at a time.
   Sandinista dominance of the media appeared to begin easing a bit
last year when prior censorship ended; the Sandinistas also gave
the opposition a bit of television time during the campaign.
   After they lost the Feb. 25 election, the Sandinistas lifted the
ban on private television and began moving to ensure themselves a
firm grip on the public eye and ear.
   ``They are trying to dominate the dial,'' said Frank Arana, a
member of the UNO transition team for media matters.
   One of the new TV licenses went to the vehemently pro-Sandinista
publishers of the newspaper El Nuevo Diario, which now sports a
graphic of a television set on its masthead.
   ``END TV-18. In Your Home Soon,'' the legend on the tiny screen
says.
   Another, Channel 4, will be run by a top Sandinista official,
Tourism Minister Herty Lewites, who said he also plans to start an
airline.
   Meanwhile, a new transmission tower has sprouted at what used to
be the Sandinista campaign headquarters, the home of a new
Sandinista radio station, Radio Ya (Radio Now!).
   Once Radio Ya begins broadcasting, the party or party loyalists
will control choice frequencies ranging from 600 to 840 on the AM
dial.
   The UNO transition team only learned last week that the
state-run radio network had been dismantled, Arana said.
   ``We were morally deceived,'' he said. ``But not surprised.''
   Nicaragua has been rife with rumors and reports that state
property was mysteriously evaporating in the wake of defeat.
   The Sandinistas insist they will hand over the machinery of the
state intact. But UNO officials say that they won't know precisely
what they are inheriting until Mrs. Chamorro takes office Wednesday.
   UNO doesn't even know whether there is enough money in the
treasury to meet the state payroll at the end of the month, Mrs.
Chamorro's top economic adviser, Francisco Mayorga, said Monday.
   In the case of the radio network, Sandinista officials told the
UNO transition team that some of the radio stations were turned
over to individuals and others to municipal officials.
   Barricada, the Sandinista party's official newspaper, said the
idea was to put the stations in the hands of people ``concerned
with promoting culture and ethical values and morals that benefit
the great majority'' and to ensure ``the continuation of
participative radio and guarantee communication for ordinary
people.''
   Arana said the UNO team hasn't been able to confirm who the new
owners of the radio stations are but plans to investigate.
   ``They were state property. They can't just give them away,''
Arana said in an interview Monday.
   Arana said the Sandinista loyalists who worked for the state
advertising and publicity firms are the new owners.
   ``It's not an isolated case. Things like this are happening in a
lot of the ministries,'' he said.
   The Sandinistas confiscated 66 privately owned radio stations
after the revolution, took over the government station, La Voz de
Nicaragua, and turned ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza's station
into the Sandinista party's Radio Sandino.
   Some of the stations were stripped of their equipment, others
were renamed, many simply vanished. Only 17 were left when the
network was dismantled after the election.
   The pre-revolutionary owners want their stations _ or what is
left of them _ back, said broadcaster Mariano Valle, whose family
lost 11 stations and plans legal action to claim its stations.
   Like the government TV stations, La Voz de Nicaragua appears
intact, Arana said.

<HEAD>Republicans Have No Credible Challenger for New York's Cuomo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A winter of discontent has turned into a dry
spring for New York Republicans seeking a credible candidate to
challenge Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   No major GOP figure has been willing to step forward to take on
Cuomo's expected re-election bid. The New York Democrat is widely
viewed as a potential 1992 presidential contender should he survive
the 1990 state election.
   ``I'm not a kamikaze,'' Sen. Alfonse D'Amato said last August as
he became the first of many Republicans to keep their hats out of
the ring.
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, the former Buffalo-area congressman
who once quarterbacked the Buffalo Bills, officially moved to
Maryland.
   State Assembly Minority Leader Clarence Rappleyea put on an
``I'm Not Running For Governor!'' campaign-style button following a
published report that he might be interested.
   Rudolph Giuliani, the former federal prosecutor who narrowly
lost the race for mayor of New York City last year, told party
leaders to look elsewhere.
   The 1986 Republican candidate, Westchester County Executive
Andrew O'Rourke, said he would need ``a frontal lobotomy'' before
he'd run again. He suffered the worst defeat in modern New York
gubernatorial elections.
   It's not that Cuomo is invulnerable. This is the third straight
year of budget deficits for New York, the second straight year of
$1 billion tax increases and the sixth straight year Cuomo has been
unable to deliver a budget by the April 1 start of the fiscal year.
   At the end of March, Wall Street dropped New York's credit
rating to its lowest level ever. Only Louisiana and Massachusetts
were in worse shape.
   Proclaiming him ``Loser of the Week,'' Time magazine said
``Cuomo is only one polluted harbor away from becoming the next
Michael Dukakis.''
   It didn't matter. New York Republicans still couldn't find a
candidate.
   ``This is depressing me,'' President Bush said recently of the
situation. While admitting Cuomo was ``a formidable political
opponent,'' the president said New York Republicans should ``find a
strong opponent for him.''
   Shortly thereafter, White House chief of staff John Sununu
telephoned former New York Rep. Guy Molinari to encourage the newly
elected Staten Island borough president to challenge Cuomo.
Molinari said he was too busy with his new job.
   Meanwhile, in neighboring Massachusetts, Connecticut and
Vermont, incumbent Democratic Govs. Dukakis, William O'Neill and
Madeleine Kunin all have decided against seeking re-election. They
also were facing severe state fiscal problems.
   No such luck for New York Republicans.
   ``This is no time to be quitting as governor,'' Cuomo said
earlier this month, referring to New York's fiscal problems and his
re-election plans.
   With the state GOP nominating convention scheduled for the end
of May, the only announced Republican candidate is little-known
Rockland County insurance broker Herbert Holland.
   Evan Galbraith, a former U.S. ambassador to France who is
chairman of the Moet-Hennessy champagne and cognac company, had
planned to run until a state court ruled that he didn't meet New
York's five-year residency requirement.
   This year was supposed to be different for Republicans. With the
help of Jonathan Bush, the president's brother, and other major New
York Republicans, J. Patrick Barrett was elected state GOP chairman
last June.
   Barrett, a millionaire former chairman of the Avis car rental
company, vowed to revitalize the party, have a strong candidate for
governor by the start of this year and build a multimillion-dollar
campaign war chest.
   Last week, the bipartisan state Board of Elections unanimously
voted to investigate whether the state Republican Committee had
intentionally filed an incomplete campaign finance report in
January. The filing failed to list the GOP committee's unpaid bills
of more than $365,000. That debt has since grown to about $750,000,
according to party officials.
   A recent GOP fundraising event brought in about $115,000, a
third of what had been expected. Shortly thereafter, Barrett fired
three state committee employees, or one-quarter of his entire staff.
   Meanwhile, Cuomo's campaign bank account has grown to more than
$7 million and a recent statewide poll had the governor's
job-approval rating at 62 percent. The poll was commissioned by New
York Republicans.

<HEAD>After Peru, U.S. Drug Agreements with Bolivia, Colombia Expected</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After concluding an aid agreement with the
Peruvian military to curb narcotics trafficking, the Bush
administration is about to complete similar pacts with Colombia and
Bolivia, U.S. officials say.
   The $35 million aid package with Peru was announced over the
weekend in Lima and will involve the Peruvian military in the
anti-drug effort for the first time.
   Negotiations with the three Andean countries have taken place
since shortly after President Bush announced his anti-drug strategy
last September and disclosed his intention to increase military
cooperation with each country.
   Consistent with earlier announcements, the Colombian program
will be $40.3 million and Bolivia's will be $33.7 million. The U.S.
officials, who insisted on anonymity, said the signings of the
agreements are imminent.
   The United States will provide the Peruvian military with
training and refurbishing of aircraft. Some aid also will be given
to the Peruvian Navy. Contrary to some reports, there will be no
U.S. involvement in the construction of a military base, but
assistance will be offered in selecting a site for a new base, the
officials said.
   The agreement signifies a renewal of U.S. cooperation with the
Peruvian military, which has had close ties with the Soviet
military for many years.
   In contrast to Bolivia, where there is no significant
insurgency, the U.S. programs in Peru and Colombia have a
counter-insurgency component to them in addition to their principal
goal of curbing narcotics flows.
   In a letter earlier this month to Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla.,
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the State
Department's top aide for congressional relations, Janet Mullins,
said:
   ``While the ultimate purpose of the military assistance,
including equipment and training ... is to combat narcotics
trafficking and production, it is inevitable that counter-narcotics
activities will at times require counter-insurgency efforts to
regain government control over certain areas.''
   Among the principal backers of the coca leaf growers in the
Upper Huallaga Valley of Peru are the Shining Path guerrillas, the
powerful leftist movement that seeks to bring about a
worker-peasant state. The valley is the source of the raw material
for about half the world's cocaine.
   Some members of Congress, including Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
have expressed concern that a U.S. role in support of
counter-insurgency operations in Peru could get the United States
involved in a civil war.
   In response to those allegations, State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said Monday that U.S. military personnel will not
participate in operations.
   ``No additional Defense Department personnel will be stationed
permanently in Peru,'' she said. ``There will be rotating teams of
Defense personnel visiting Peru during the next several months to
conduct training, particularly in connection with the new equipment
agreed to by the government of Peru.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said that at any given time, there will be between
10 and 15 personnel working on various projects on temporary duty
in Peru.

   Despite their apparent help in liberating
American hostage Robert Polhill, Iran and Syria will remain on the
State Department's list of countries that sponsor terrorism, U.S.
officials say.
   Meanwhile, in a series of messages passed to Tehran by
intermediaries, the Bush administration has notified Iran it cannot
expect an improvement in relations until all seven Americans held
in Lebanon by pro-Iranian militants are freed, the officials said
Monday.
   Remaining on the terrorism list means Iran and Syria will
continue to be deprived of U.S. backing for international bank
loans and sophisticated American technology.
   The department's annual terrorism report is due to be released
next Monday. It was finished two weeks ago, before Polhill was
freed by the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Even so, the report could have been revised. But a U.S. official
said, speaking Monday on condition of anonymity, ``we are not
calling it back from the printers.''
   Six countries in all are on the list. Besides Iran and Syria,
they are Libya, South Yemen, Cuba and North Korea. The last change
was the removal of Iraq in 1984.
   Getting off the list requires a renunciation of terrorism and
six months of good behavior, among other tests. The officials said
Iran and Syria had not qualified.
   President Bush on Monday called President Hafez Assad of Syria
to thank him for assisting in the release of Polhill, whose 39
months of captivity in Lebanon ended on Sunday.
   Syria informed the United States that its ally, Iran, also
helped. No details were provided to support the claim.
   The administration, in messages passed by Switzerland, Algeria,
Japan and other governments, has informed Iran over the last
several months that release of the hostages would improve relations
with Washington, U.S. officials said.
   Iran, in the meantime, has said through intermediaries that it
would like to improve relations and said a second hostage might be
set free, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The exchanges were described by one official as
``intermittent,'' continuing through the days before Polhill's
release. The U.S. reply, the official said, was that all the
hostages must be freed before the United States would renew ties
with Tehran.
   The Carter administration suspended relations in April 1980
while 52 Americans were held hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
Iran is believed to have considerable influence with militants
holding the seven Americans in Lebanon.
   ``I hope the Polhill release means something for the future and
they got our message,'' said a U.S. official.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said ``our
hostages should be released unconditionally, safely and
immediately, and this barbaric practice should end.''
   He made the statement in response to Iranian demands that the
United States exert influence on a Christian group in Lebanon to
release Iranian captives and on Israel to free a pro-Iranian Shiite
cleric, Abdul Karim Obeid, seized last summer in Lebanon.
   ``We are not going to deal and we're not going to negotiate,''
Baker said at a news conference. ``We remain hopeful. We will
continue to call on the world community to do what they can to
obtain the release of all hostages.''
   At the same time, Baker said, ``We do not support
hostage-taking. I don't think hostage-taking serves any useful
purpose.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that only the
unconditional release of all American hostages would ``open the
door towards better relations with Iran.''
   He pointed to what he said were encouraging remarks by Syrian
officials and to a Tehran Times editorial saying all hostages ought
to be freed.
   But he also said the United States had no solid evidence that
the release of Polhill would necessarily lead to freedom for the
other Americans.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler, when asked if
officials had reason to expect another American would be set free,
said, ``No, we do not.''

<HEAD>Bennett Rejects Direct Anti-Drug Aid to Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal drug policy chief William Bennett is
rejecting suggestions by the nation's mayors for direct anti-drug
aid to their cities and for more emphasis on education and
treatment.
   Bennett told mayors gathered for a conference on drugs and crime
Monday that it is too soon to redirect spending on drug enforcement
and interdiction efforts to domestic prevention and treatment.
   His remarks drew a blast from a frequent critic, Boston Mayor
Raymond L. Flynn, as ``well-intentioned but off the mark.''
   ``The choice for our young people cannot be either poverty or
selling drugs,'' said Flynn, a Democrat. ``An essential alternative
has to be jobs and education. As long as the White House continues
to feel that the answer is in law enforcement alone at the local
level, the war will never be won.''
   Bennett, director of drug policy in the Bush administration,
repeated the administration's opposition to sending federal
anti-drug money directly to cities, rather than through the states.
   Many mayors contend the money isn't reaching them and want
federal aid that bypasses the states. But Bennett said direct aid
would ``create a confusing and disorderly hodge-podge'' and might
slow the distribution of aid even more.
   Mayor Bill Harris of Lincoln, Neb., a Democratic candidate for
governor, suggested a greater portion of federal anti-drug money be
spent on prevention efforts.
   ``I think not yet,'' Bennett replied. ``I wouldn't shift
resources from interdiction yet.''
   The mayor of Bogota, Colombia, Andres Pastrana, told his U.S.
counterparts that the war on drugs has brought havoc and bloodshed
to his country.
   He said Colombia should respond to invitations for
plea-bargaining from Colombian drug leaders known as
``extraditables,'' who have offered to give up production and
submit to Colombian law.
   ``If we continue to pursue the Wild West model, thousands of
Colombians and thousands of Americans will die,'' Pastrana said.
   The Bogota mayor, who himself was kidnapped and held for eight
days in 1988 by drug kingpins, said he supports proposals for
finding a way to permit plea-bargaining, not now allowed in his
country.
   ``We have to decide which is best: to gradually eliminate the
production, commercialization and sale of narcotics and the wealth
they generate, or to have the picture of a Colombian national
rotting in a Miami prison,'' Pastrana said.
   Washington Mayor Marion Barry, awaiting trial on cocaine
possession and perjury charges, made brief mention of his own
problem in welcoming the group.
   He thanked the mayors ``for your sincere and deep, honest
prayers during my difficult time.''
   ``And believe me, they have been answered,'' Barry said. ``I
feel better, I'm back here in good spirits and high self-esteem,
clearer vision and glad to see a number of you.''
   Barry later said he didn't feel uncomfortable addressing a
conference on drugs, despite his arrest and subsequent treatment
for substance abuse at two clinics.
   ``You assume a person is innocent until proven guilty, and
that's my attitude about all of this,'' he said. ``It will come out
in the court ... I'm still the mayor.''

   Space shuttle Discovery stood ready
once again, weather willing, to ferry the Hubble Space Telescope
into orbit Tuesday to seek answers to two questions: how old is the
universe, and how big?
   At the Kennedy Space Center on Monday, officials expressed
confidence the liftoff, scheduled for 8:31 a.m. EDT, will occur.
   But there was little of the excitement of two weeks ago when
hundreds of astronomers gathered, with their families, only to see
the launch scrubbed with four minutes to go in the countdown.
   ``Here we are once again,'' said William Lenoir, head of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space flight
program. ``We think once again we are ready.''
   The unstable weather during launch preparations on Monday was
more of a concern than Tuesday's. NASA delayed by an hour the
rollback of the service structure which had protected the shuttle
from the elements.
   Loading of more than a half million gallons of hazardous fuel
began at 12:11 a.m. Tuesday as scheduled.
   For Tuesday, there was the prospect of an hour's delay for early
morning fog but little else to worry about.
   The crew of five, commanded by Loren Shriver, spent the day
making last minute changes in flight plans, undergoing equipment
checks and relaxing. One member, Steven Hawley, had a special
reason for wanting the mission to begin on Tuesday.
   Hawley holds the record among shuttle astronauts for climbing
into the shuttle cockpit, dressed for flight, only to have the
liftoff delayed. On his first flight, Hawley underwent three
scrubs; on his second, it was six times. The aborted countdown on
April 10 was his 10th.
   Since then, another change has come to this seaside launch area.
For the first time since January 1986 _ and only the second time
ever _ there was a shuttle on pads A and B in Complex 39.
   Then, too, one of the shuttles was Columbia. The other was the
Challenger which exploded 73 seconds after launch because of a leak
in its right booster rocket. This time, Columbia is scheduled to
make its 10th flight in mid-May with another scientific payload,
the Astro observatory.
   For now, it was Discovery, the shuttle on pad B, that commanded
attention.
   The $1.5 billion Hubble telescope, the finest ever made, is
expected ``to give us a new set of eyes and ears,'' said Lenoir.
``I can't say what we are going to learn, but I will be astounded
if we don't learn many new things.''
   Lennard Fisk, the head of NASA's science activities, said
``astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what
the Hubble will be able to accomplish.''
   The telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better
resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than any ground-based
telescope and one-half billion times more sensitivity than the
human eye.
   ``We are going to have the ability to observe the most distant
objects in the universe, and therefore among the earliest, and
therefore probe the secrets of creation,'' he said. ``We are ready
to begin that new era in astronomy that Hubble will usher in.''
   During the first launch attempt, NASA and its contractors set up
two huge tents at the press site and had experts on hand to
describe their work on various aspects of the telescope. The tents
came down after the scrub, the astronomers left, and only a small
cadre of experts was about.
   The attempt was in the week before Easter and many of the
scientists had planned vacations around the event, a milestone in
astronomical research.
   ``Today I bring you only good news,'' NASA test director Al
Sofge said Monday. ``The launch vehicle is in good shape. The
Hubble Space Telescope is in good shape. The flight crew is ready
... and the weather looks good. So at this point, everything is
go.''
   Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a
shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper
orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. Hawley will guide
the shuttle's 50-foot long crane as it lifts the 24,250-pound
telescope out of the cargo bay and drops it overboard on the second
day of the five-day mission.

<HEAD>Yeutter: Farmers Will Have to Look to Marketplace for More Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget-cutting pressures on Capitol Hill are
making it more important for farmers to get a bigger income slice
from the marketplace, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says.
   For example, he said a new spending package announced last week
by Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, would hold spending on farm income support under federal
commodity programs to $9.8 billion in the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1.
   An administration budget plan sent to Congress in January called
for $10.2 billion, a reduction of $1.5 billion from the increase
that normally would occur if annual ``baseline'' spending trends
were followed.
   Yeutter told a meeting Monday of the National Association of
Agricultural Journalists that the administration and he, in
particular, had come in for severe partisan criticism for the
proposed $1.5 billion spending reduction.
   The budget figures by Panetta will be even harder for the House
Agriculture Committee to reckon with because those amount to a $1.9
billion cut from the baseline, he said.
   ``We now have a much different situation in farm legislation
than we did a few days ago,'' Yeutter said.
   However, the situation also depends on whose baseline is being
used. The current USDA baseline is $11.7 billion, which was based
on crop indications last fall. Thus, a $1.5 billion reduction would
be required to needed to lower fiscal 1991 spending to the $10.2
billion cited by Yeutter as the Bush proposal.
   The Panetta figure of $9.8 billion was derived from a
Congressional Budget Office baseline of $10.6 billion computed as
of February.
   Under that computation, the Panetta budget reduction would be
only $800 million, not the $1.9 billion Yeutter said.
   Regardless of whose figures are used, farm commodity programs
are in for some more paring. And Yeutter made the point that it
will be even more urgent for the United States to seek a favorable
conclusion to the on-going Uruguay Round negotiations under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he said. The GATT talks,
scheduled to conclude at the end of this year, are aimed a
liberalizing world trade.
   The U.S. position on agricultural trade calls for the gradual
elimination of all trade-distorting policies and subsidies over a
period of years.
   Yeutter said there is a feeling in some U.S. agricultural
circles that the GATT talks are being overemphasized and that
farmers would be better off relying on Congress to write generous
price and income support provisions in the new farm bill.
   But there will ``not be a lucrative price package'' in the farm
bill, Yeutter said. Therefore, farmers will have to generate more
of their income from the marketplace.
   ``We're simply not going to have the flow of federal tax dollars
into agriculture in the coming year that we've had in the past,''
he said.
   Yeutter said a two-price dairy plan approved last week by a
House Agriculture subcommittee has some ``very negative'' features
and would put a heavier cost burden on consumers.
   Members of the House wheat, soybeans and feed grains
subcommittee also faced grim financial reality last week when
Panetta announced the budget figures.
   The lawmakers' plans for price supports would cost $16 billion
more over the five-year life of the bill than the budget would
allow, committee staff said.
   Sections of the farm bill dealing with those commodities were
put on hold until this Thursday while the lawmakers find places to
cut.

   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union has bought an additional 149,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices for delivery next month under a long-term grain
supply agreement.
   Christopher E. Goldthwaite, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said Monday the wheat
was sold by two private companies, which will receive subsidies
under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Goldthwaite said 563,950 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation. Only wheat has been approved for
sale to the Soviets under the price subsidy program.
   The seventh year of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement began last
Oct. 1. With the latest sales, the Soviet Union has bought more
than 3.2 million tons of wheat for 1989-90 delivery and more than
13.1 million tons of corn, plus soybeans and soybean meal. All of
the wheat was sold under EEP arrangements.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 149,000 tons are equal to nearly 5.5 million bushels,
worth about $19 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Goldthwaite reported the subsidies at an average of $28.87 per
ton, or about 79 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Goldthwaite said the latest wheat was sold by Continental Grain
Co., 99,000 tons; and J. Aron &amp; Co., 50,000 tons.

   Western states will have low water supplies
this summer in many areas, according to an Agriculture Department
report.
   ``With snowfall virtually over and snowmelt beginning, it looks
like spring and summer streamflows will be below average for most
of the West,'' Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil
Conservation Service, said Monday. ``The wise use of water will be
more important than ever.''
   Streamflows are forecast to be less than 70 percent of average
in California, Nevada, Arizona, most of Oregon, Utah and New
Mexico, southern Idaho, southwestern Wyoming and western Colorado.
   The only western areas where streamflows are expected to be
above average are most streams in southern Alaska, the Cache la
Poudre River in Colorado, and the headwaters of the Tongue River in
Wyoming and the Kootenai River in Canada and Montana, the report
said.
   Western states depend on snowmelt for about 75 percent of their
water supply.

<TEXT>
   The parents of a newborn who received the
heart of her brain-dead twin brother may be able to take their
daughter home within weeks.
   Alison Paige Whisman, believed to be the first recipient of a
heart from an infant twin, wriggled on her hospital bed in pink
booties Monday as Timothy and Paula Whisman watched a sonogram of
their dead son's heart beating inside her.
   ``She acts normal and is quite well,'' said Dr. Randall L.
Caldwell. ``I'd say her prognosis is good, but all patients that
have had a heart transplant you have to watch.''
   The baby, called Paige by her parents, may be able to leave the
Riley Hospital for Children in 10 days to two weeks, Caldwell said.
   Her growth could be delayed some by the drugs she has to take,
said Caldwell. But she already has gained almost a pound from the 4
pounds, 13 ounces she weighed at birth 14 days ago.
   Their daughter's progress is uplifting to the parents, whose
ordeal after their twins' birth April 10 ``was a roller coaster
ride and it was all downhill for about four days,'' Whisman said.
   Four weeks premature, Paige was born a minute before her
brother, Tyler Joseph, and appeared normal. Tyler asphyxiated in
the womb just before birth for unknown reasons.
   The next morning, Paige's coloring changed, tipping off doctors
that she had a fatal heart defect. While one child lay ill and the
other brain dead on a life-support system, Mrs. Whisman wondered
whether Tyler's heart could be transplanted into Paige.
   Because the twins were not identical, the chances of an organ
match were uncertain. The Whismans, who are Roman Catholics, had
their babies baptized during Easter week as they waited for test
results on their children.
   On Good Friday, Whisman remembered, he drove 20 miles home to
Cicero to work on the couple's tax return and called back to the
hospital to talk to his wife. ``Honey, honey, Tyler's heart is
compatible,'' he recalled her saying.
   The next day, Tyler's heart was transplanted into Paige. His
liver was later transplanted into a 3{-month-old girl in Wisconsin,
Whisman said.
   ``We needed a reason to let people know that Tyler was here,''
said Whisman. ``They said he was dead at birth, but he lived long
enough to help two children.''
   Now the couple, married less than three years, say they are
going to have to buy clothing for a girl; although Tyler's gender
was determined in the womb, doctors did not know whether his twin
would be a boy or a girl, said Mrs. Whisman.
   ``So everything we have is either yellow or blue,'' she said.
   The Whismans also look forward to the day when they'll be able
to tell Paige about her brother. ``We're very happy little Tyler
will be remembered,'' said Whisman. ``She deserves to know about
her brother.''

   Soviet economists participating in a unique
conference with their U.S. counterparts took an even gloomier view
of their country's economy than Western experts, according to the
event's chairman.
   ``The range of opinion for the Soviet group was somewhere
between pessimism and depression, as far as the prospects for
turnaround'' for the Soviet economy, said Nicholas Eberstadt, an
American Enterprise Institute scholar who was conference chairman.
   The Soviet analysts offered grim pictures of their country's
standard of living, the size of its economy relative to other world
powers, and the burden its military places on the overall economy,
Eberstadt said.
   And he said at least one irony emerged from the four-day
meeting: Soviet officials chiding the Central Intelligence Agency
for being taken in by Soviet propaganda that overstated the
country's economic performance.
   ``It was the sense of the group that the old official Soviet
estimates are not plausible,'' he said.
   The meeting was the first at which high-level Soviet economists
have held frank exchanges with their U.S. counterparts.
   The conference report reinforced a downbeat view of the Soviet
economy released last week by the CIA. In congressional testimony,
agency Deputy Director for Intelligence John Helgerson called the
economy's 1989 performance ``abysmal'' and cited price increases
and shortages of consumer goods.
   Although comparisons between market and non-market economies are
difficult at best, Soviet economist Victor Belkin estimated his
country's gross national product is only 14 to 28 percent that of
the United States. That would rank it as low as eighth in the
world, behind the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Great
Britain, Italy and perhaps even India.
   Official estimates by the CIA have ranked the Soviet economy
second after the United States, putting it at about half the U.S.
gross national product of 5.3 trillion.
   Another Soviet analyst, Vladimir Tikhonov, said his country's
agricultural statistics substantially overstate Soviet food output.
Meat production is barely half the officially reported figure, he
said. Grain output in 1988 was less than 140 million tons, rather
than the 195 million officially reported.
   Oleg Bogomolov, another conference participant, put Soviet
military spending at 20 to 25 percent of GNP, roughly 200 billion
rubles a year. That compares with the 77 billion rubles officially
reported. The CIA estimate has been 15 percent.
   ``The Soviet level of military burden is more or less what North
Korea's is, which means that it is a highly militarized society, on
a war footing,'' Eberstadt said.
   Another Soviet researcher, Yuri Dykhanov, said the living
standard of Soviet citizens averages about 20 percent that of the
United States; the CIA puts the figure at one-third the U.S. level.
   ``The idea that the Soviet living standard might be as much as
one-third that of the U.S. standard struck the Soviet group as
utterly fanciful,'' Eberstadt said.
   The Soviet Union is beginning new research in cooperation with
Austria and West Germany aimed at finding better, more accurate
measures for its economy, he said.

<HEAD>`Republicans for Choice' Aims to Eliminate Anti-Abortion Platform
Plank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The internal Republican Party debate over
abortion is heating up with formation of a grassroots drive to
eliminate the strong anti-abortion plank from the party platform.
   Ann Stone, a conservative activist, said Monday that Republicans
for Choice has recruited more than 200 GOP officeholders as part of
its $3 million drive to elect pro-choice delegates to the 1992
convention.
   ``Our party will face defeat in the 1990 congressional and
gubernatorial elections,'' said a prospectus mailed by the group to
Republicans around the country. ``President Bush's re-election
could even be endangered.''
   Stone, who described herself as ``pro-choice and pro-life,''
said she had no expectation that the man expected to dominate the
1992 convention, President Bush, will change his position.
   ``Our party is a big tent and George Bush and all of us sit
under it,'' she said.
   If the drive fails to get the convention to put pro-choice
language in the 1992 platform, Stone said she would try to drop
abortion from the document.
   The 1988 platform said that ``the unborn child has a fundamental
individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We therefore
reaffirm our support for a human life amendment to the
Constitution, and we endorse legislation to make clear that the
Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children. We
oppose the use of public funds for organizations which advocate or
support abortion.''
   But in the 1989 elections, held months after the Supreme Court
gave states far greater leeway to place restrictions on abortion,
Republicans lost races for governor of Virginia and New Jersey,
contests in which the GOP candidates were attacked for their
anti-abortion views.
   Stone, who said she personally opposes abortion, contended that
the party would suffer far greater losses this year and in 1992
unless it changes its position.
   ``The 1988 Republican National Platform included a right-to-life
plank that we believe is not representative of a majority of
Republicans or most Americans,'' said the group's prospectus.
   The document went on to cite the 1989 elections as proof that
``this position on abortion is dangerous politically and will cost
us the votes of many traditional Republicans as well as the vote of
a majority of young voters 18 to 35.''
   The three goals cited were to fight to change the platform;
elect pro-choice Republicans as delegates and to ``fight efforts
within the Republican National Committee or within state Republican
committees to force our party to oppose the option of legal
abortion.''
   Leslie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Republican National
Committee, said, ``We certainly would advocate people getting out
there and working both sides of the issue. ... We think there is a
dialogue that needs to take place.''
   But she declined to speculate on whether the platform might be
changed.
   ``I can't even look that far ahead,'' she said.
   The group claims more than 200 recruits for its advisory board,
including Reps. Tom Campbell of California, Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut and Jim Kolbe of Arizona.
   Stone has her own direct-mail fundraising firm and has long been
active on behalf of conservative candidates and causes.
   She said her views on abortion had never been known because ``no
one ever asked me.''
   She said she didn't oppose the party's shift to an anti-abortion
position at the 1980 convention because that was what the nominee,
Ronald Reagan, wanted.
   ``I voted for him and I worked hard for him,'' she said.

<HEAD>Groups at Odds Over Cost of New Apartments for Handicapped</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government and home builders and groups of
the handicapped are split over whether proposed guidelines
guaranteeing disabled people access to new apartments would price
many of them out of housing.
   A task force formed by the National Coordinating Council on
Spinal Cord Injury and the National Association of Home Builders
said Monday that the guidelines would put new apartment rents out
of reach of many low- and medium-income people, including the
handicapped.
   ``If design guidelines result in significant increases in the
cost of housing, then we have defeated the purpose of the Fair
Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and created another barrier to
accessibility,'' said R. Jack Powell, president of the spinal
injury group and executive director of the Paralyzed Veterans of
America.
   But Gordon Mansfield, assistant HUD secretary for fair housing
and a former Paralyzed Veterans official, contended in an interview
that the guidelines are within Congress' intent and would add only
1 percent to apartment rents.
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp ``has
instructed us to pay attention to affordability'' and ``probably
what we are proposing is less than the home builders,'' said
Mansfield, a paraplegic from a spinal cord injury suffered in the
Vietnam war.
   Bonnie Milstein, co-chairman of the Housing Task Force of the
Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, agreed. She said the
Task Force on Handicap Accessibility set up by the home builders
and spinal injury group is basing its estimates on expenditures not
required by the Fair Housing amendments.
   Congressional amendments to the Fair Housing Act require HUD to
insure that disabled people have easy access to new multi-family
apartments first occupied after next March 13.
   The guidelines involve such things as the width of doors and
halls, the size of bathrooms and walk-in pantries and the grading
and ramping of steeply sloped sites.
   The home builders and spinal cord council contended that the
proposed guidelines ``will increase significantly'' the cost of
apartment construction, ``further slowing an already depressed
multi-family industry and exacerbating the affordability crisis
currently confronting millions of low- and moderate-income
households.''
   Powell told a news conference at National Association of Home
Builders headquarters that the cost of meeting the proposed
guidelines would range from $1,300 to $3,700 for walk-up units and
from $3,200 to $4,250 for mid- to high-rise apartments.
   That cost, he said, will be passed on to consumers, resulting in
monthly rent increases of $13 to $37 for walk-up units and of $32
to $43 for mid- or high-rise units.
   But Mansfield said the HUD guidelines would increase the cost of
a $50,000 apartment by just 1 percent, or $500, which both HUD and
the handicap accessibility task force agree is within the cost that
Congress intended.
   In addition to the disagreement over the effects of the new law,
the uncertainty over the guidelines has severely disrupted the
multi-family construction industry, said Kent W. Colton, executive
vice president of the home builders.
   He said the industry finished 1989 with only 373,000 building
starts, down nearly 50 percent from 1985 and the lowest level since
1975,
   Mansfield said the draft guidelines are being considered by the
Office of Management and Budget, which much approve many government
regulations before they take effect.
   ``We would like to see the guidelines as soon as possible,'' he
said.
   The home builders group is a federation of more than 800
construction associations with more than 157,000 members. The
coordinating council is composed of 17 organizations associated
with spinal cord injuries, of which the largest is the Paralyzed
Veterans of America.
   The consortium includes in its membership United Cerebral Palsy,
the American Foundation for the Blind and the Easter Seal Society.
   All three organizations supported the Fair Housing amendments.

   A collection of political have-nots is out to
accomplish collectively what its members couldn't do individually:
Defeat the powers of congressional incumbency.
   ``Our country is suffering from an imperial, permanent Congress.
It is a Congress that cannot solve the problems we have,''
complained Paul Jurgens, a Decatur, Ill., Republican who ran
unsuccessfully for the House in 1988.
   He was one of more than three dozen past and current
congressional challengers who gathered Monday on Capitol Hill to
call for a political housecleaning.
   ``Our federally elected officials have so rigged the process
that they are impossible to unseat,'' said Harold Coker, a
Chattanooga, Tenn., Republican and losing candidate in 1988.
   That complaint was the central theme at a meeting of the
Coalition to End the Permanent Congress, a grassroots organization
formed out of frustration with the 1988 elections, in which 98.5
percent of House incumbents won re-election.
   Coalition members from at least 18 states advocated a long list
of reform proposals. Among them were a ban on taxpayer-paid mass
mailings by members of Congress; prohibiting lawmakers from
accepting honoraria or speaking fees; eliminating political action
committees, which contribute mostly to campaigns of incumbents; and
imposing a 12-year limit on how long members can serve in the House
and Senate.
   Lionel Kunst, a Kansas Democrat who helped found the group,
urged coalition members to return to their states and vigorously
push the issue of congressional reform among voters.
   ``This thing is hot right now. We can make a greater impact,''
said Kunst.
   The group has met about a half dozen times in other cities since
its first gathering last year in Kansas City, Mo.
   The coalition's latest assault on incumbency came as the Senate
prepared to consider legislation to overhaul the system of
financing congressional campaigns. But Kunst denounced the
legislation as ``pablum'' and said it would do little for
challengers.

<TEXT>
   Fear of racial violence has swept anew through
Peru's 60,000-member Japanese community since Alberto Fujimori, the
son of immigrants, stunned the nation by rocketing from unknown to
presidential frontrunner.
   People of Asian descent, including the large Chinese community,
have increasingly been threatened, insulted in public, and denied
entry to restaurants since Fujimori's surprisingly strong finish in
the April 8 vote.
   For many, it's a nightmare relived.
   Fifty years ago, just before the outbreak of World War II in the
Pacific, Juan Iida watched mobs loot the homes and businesses of
Japanese Peruvians.
   ``It was the worst experience of my life,'' said Iida, the
77-year-old founder of the Japanese-language daily newspaper Peru
Shimpo. ``I don't even want to think about it happening again.''
   Anti-Japanese fever peaked with a recent statement by Sen.
Enrique Chirinos Soto, a spokesman for rival candidate Mario Vargas
Llosa. He said Peru is not ``ready to have as president a
first-generation Peruvian.''
   Vargas Llosa dismissed the spokesman and decried the racial
incidents. People in other circles, including outgoing President
Alan Garcia and Lima's Roman Catholic archbishop, have also spoken
out against the hatred.
   Fujimori, an agronomist born of Japanese parents, won nearly 30
percent of the vote in the April 8 balloting to 32 percent for
Vargas Llosa, forcing a runoff. Backed by left-of-center voters,
the political independent is expected to prevail over the
conservative novelist in voting expected in early June.
   ``Fujimori is as Peruvian as I am and as you are,'' Vargas Llosa
shouted at supporters who chanted anti-Japanese slogans outside his
home the night after the election. Even so, some critics have
accused members of his center-right Democratic Front coalition of
deliberately fanning the fires of racism to cut into Fujimori's
support.
   ``It was a primitive response by frustrated people,'' said
Amelia Morimoto Hayashi, of the Japanese Peruvian Cultural Center.
   However, in the long run, it may be Vargas Llosa who suffers if
race becomes an important issue in the campaign, according to some
analysts.
   Eighty-five percent of Peru's population is Indian and mestizo.
Another 5 percent is black.
   In addition, Vargas Llosa is viewed by many as part of the white
caste that has traditionally ruled this Andean country from coastal
Lima. An urbane man, he lived and wrote for 16 years in Europe
before returning to Peru in 1974. Critics accuse him of being out
of touch with Peruvian reality.
   ``The final stretch of the campaign revealed the racist and
class character of Vargas Llosa's entourage,'' said Fernando
Rospigliosi, a columnist for the independent news magazine Caretas.
   Indeed, Rospigliosi said Fujimori's success so far has stemmed
in great measure from deeply rooted anti-white prejudices: ``The
high vote obtained by Fujimori can be explained in part, in my
opinion, by the racial factor.''
   Fujimori's own reaction has varied with the moment.
   Sometimes he has joked. ``Some people fear that during my
government they will have to eat with chopsticks,'' he said soon
after the elections.
   Later, he blamed the racial outbursts on ``certain discontented
groups that are making use of whatever weapons available to create
problems.''
   Fujimori's own campaign may actually have helped bring the
racism to the surface.
   Throughout the race, he played on Peruvians' stereotype of
orientals as ``hard-working and honest.'' He has repeatedly
referred to himself as ``el chinito,'' the little Chinaman.
   Many voters thus came to view him as a foreigner, and this
worked largely in his favor. Public opinion polls show that voters
regard foreigners as less corrupt and more efficient than Peruvians.
   Racism has long played a part in Peru's history. Peru's
television stars and news announcers are generally white, as are
people in most advertisements. The winner of the Miss Peru pageant
invariably is white.
   The Maoist guerrilla known as the Shining Path is to some extent
an outgrowth of anti-white sentiment among the Quechua-speaking
Indians of Peru's highlands.
   Most Japanese Peruvians are the children of pre-World War II
immigrants who came to work on coastal plantations. Most later
moved to cities and many started their own businesses.
   On May 13, 1940, dozens of their stores and homes were looted by
mobs driven by anti-Japanese war propaganda. Most businesses that
survived the looting were seized later by the government.
   More than 1,400 Japanese Peruvians were deported to camps in the
United States, where other Japanese Americans were detained.
   After the war most Japanese Peruvians had to start over with
nothing. Many spent the next four decades ``just trying to
integrate, to become Peruvian, so it wouldn't happen again,'' Ms.
Morimoto says.
   Most Japanese Peruvians have been successful. Many own large
businesses and factories. Others are doctors, lawyers, and
engineers.
   But the memories remain.
   ``What I fear most is that Mr. Fujimori will not make a good
government, which is a very difficult task in Peru today,'' said
61-year-old Gerardo Maruy, retiring president of the Japanese
Peruvian Association.
   ``The same people who thought him a miracle worker,'' said
Maruy, ``will be the first to turn against him, and against us.

<TEXT>
   ``I yam what I yam,'' says Popeye the Sailor
Man, but the peace-loving Quakers don't like his brawling ways and
object to the use of the cartoon character in ads for Quaker Oats.
   Not only that, toot toot, but Olive Oyl is too submissive, say
members of the Religious Society of Friends, better known as the
Quakers, a longtime champion of women's rights.
   Popeye began popping up last year in TV commercials and in
comics inserted in instant oatmeal packages, dispatching his
nemesis Bluto with a swift swing of an oversized forearm.
   ``I eats me oatmeal and I'm stronger than steel, I'm Popeye the
Quaker Man,'' he sings to an adoring Olive Oyl.
   Elizabeth Foley, spokeswoman for the Philadelphia Yearly
Meeting, the biggest Quaker group in the East, said Monday, ``They
had Popeye resolving dispute and conflict through violence. This is
completely obnoxious and offensive.''
   ``We are an organization of pacifists. We have a peace testimony
that is more than 300 years old,'' she said. ``To portray us as a
church that beats up on other people is not OK.''
   Quaker Oats Co. _ which has no connection with the religious
group _ apologized and said it deleted the phrase ``Popeye the
Quaker Man'' from commercials, which ran through the ``oatmeal
season,'' September through March.
   References to ``Popeye the Quaker Man'' will be taken out in
future printings of the comics in oatmeal packages, the
Chicago-based company said.
   ``Obviously, we looked at it as a humorous way in which to
promote the product and certainly never intended to create any
controversy,'' said company spokesman Ron Bottrell.
   However, he said Quaker Oats hasn't decided whether to drop
Popeye as a spokesman.
   In Chester County, near Philadelphia, Quaker children at the
Willistown Monthly Meeting First Day School suggested an
alternative plot.
   ``They have Popeye and Bluto coming together and saying, `Our
fights have never resolved anything. Let's try something new _
let's work together for the betterment of all,''' Foley said. ``And
they build a homeless shelter.''
   Paul Hendricks, who edits the Popeye strip for King Features
Syndicate, said the concept of Bluto and Popeye working together
isn't too farfetched.
   ``I think it'd fly. As long it's not saccharine sweet, it'd be
OK,'' Hendricks said. ``Basically Popeye's a nice guy. He just
beats up on bad guys.''

<TEXT>
   American University officials say President
Richard Berendzen resigned over allegations of improper personal
behavior, but they're not saying what Berendzen is alleged to have
done.
   Berendzen, who announced his resignation April 10, could not be
reached for comment on Monday. A published report said his
whereabouts were unknown even to university officials.
   Edward Carr, president of the university's board of trustees,
said the allegations had nothing to do with Berendzen's job.
   ``Despite the private nature of Dr. Berendzen's problem, it was
concluded that his resignation would be in the best interests of
the university,'' Carr said in a statement. ``In the interim, he
has not been on campus and he will not be returning to campus.''
   The Washington Post quoted a university vice president, Anita
Gottlieb, as saying that Berendzen has called people at the school
but that ``we have no way of reaching him back.''
   Berendzen, 51, has been American University president for 10
years.
   The former astronomy professor came to the university in 1974 as
the dean of the College Arts and Sciences and became provost three
years later.
   He announced on Apr. 10 that he was leaving at the end of the
current academic year because he was exhausted by the job.

<HEAD>Don't Say Yuck: Oat Bran Ice Cream Is on Its Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Impossible as it sounds, a food scientist says
he's invented just what the world's been waiting for: Ice cream
that's good for you.
   Not only does this stuff contain almost no fat, it might
actually lower the body's cholesterol level instead of raising it.
   The secret ingredient is a fluffy white powder made from that
darling of the food conscious, oat bran. Its principal inventor,
George E. Inglett of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's research
labs in Peoria, Ill., calls it Oatrim.
   If his predictions are correct, in two or three years it will be
an ingredient in all sorts of otherwise high-fat foods, including
mayonnaise, cheese spreads, salad dressings and margarine.
   ``It has a double whammy,'' Inglett said. ``It will replace
animal fat, such as cream, in desserts. And it acts in the body to
lower blood cholesterol.''
   To be successful, Oatrim will have to compete against other fat
substitutes that have been under development longer, and it will
have to overcome doubts that have arisen about the powers of oat
bran to lower cholesterol.
   The first of the substitutes, called Simplesse, was approved by
the Food and Drug Administration last month. It is made from egg
whites and milk protein. Others, made by Kraft and Procter &amp;
Gamble, are also under consideration by the FDA.
   Whether oat bran actually lowers blood cholesterol was called
into question by a study conducted last year at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston. Doctors concluded that cholesterol levels fall
when people eat lots of oat bran _ but only because they are too
full to eat high-fat foods that raise cholesterol.
   Oatrim is produced when enzymes are used to remove water-soluble
fiber from oat bran or oat flour. When mixed with water, it takes
on the consistency of cream cheese but has almost no taste.
   Inglett unveiled his product Monday at a meeting of the American
Chemical Society. He handed out samples of English muffins covered
with an Oatrim cheese substitute. It was sweet and bland with a
mild taste of cheddar cheese.
   While he did not show off Oatrim ice cream, he said that in
taste surveys people rate it between ice milk and ice cream. When
whipped up by a soft-serve machine, tasters describe it as
``delicious, excellent, wonderful and marvelous,'' he said.
   In one respect, it is clearly different. Four ounces of fancy
premium ice cream contain about 300 calories, 22 grams of fat and
85 milligrams of cholesterol. Oatrim ice cream has 135 calories,
virtually no fat and four milligrams of cholesterol.
   No studies have been done to see what effect the product has on
people's cholesterol. However, Dr. Rosemary K. Newman of Montana
State University tested it on chicks and found that it lowered
their cholesterol levels 18 percent.
   ``It certainly was effective in chicks,'' she said. ``I'm
excited about it'' as a food for people.
   Oatrim cannot be used as a fat substitute in baked goods, such
as cookies, because it loses its fat-like consistency when heated.
   Inglett said Oatrim powder could also be stirred into powdered
breakfast drinks to provide the same amount of oat bran fiber as a
bowl of oatmeal.
   ``Instead of eating your oatmeal,'' he said, ``there's no reason
why you can't drink it in the morning, and then you're off to
work.''

<TEXT>
   In two rescue operations in the cocaine
center of Medellin, eight kidnappers and a hostage were shot to
death but police rescued a second kidnap victim without injury,
authorities said.
   In one of Monday's raids, police rescued Diego Barrientos while
killing three of his abductors and capturing three others, police
said in a communique.
   They did not give details about Barrientos nor his abduction.
   In the other operation, police shot and killed five kidnappers
but not before the suspects shot and killed their hostage, Carlos
Sierra, who had managed a brickmaking firm, the police communique
said.
   Medellin has suffered a wave of kidnappings of business leaders
and other wealthy citizens in recent months. Authorities have
blamed many of the abductions on drug traffickers.
   The powerful Medellin cocaine cartel has declared war on the
country's political and economic elite in retaliation for a
government anti-drug crackdown that began August.
   As part of the crackdown, President Virgilio Barco decreed a
policy of extraditing Colombian drug suspects for trial in the
United States. The traffickers often escaped justice at home by
bribing or threatening court workers.
   The Colombian Justice Ministry most recently ordered the
extraditions of Rafael Juliao Fernandez and Luis Carbacas Acosta,
authorities said Monday. The government has already extradited 15
suspects as part of the crackdown, and is holding 15 others
awaiting extradition.
   More than 230 people have been killed in shootings, bombings and
other attacks blamed on drug traffickers in the last eight months.

<HEAD>Senators Got $96 Million From PACs In 1983-1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Incumbent U.S. senators collected $96.2
million in political action committee donations from 1983 through
1988, and four senators topped $2 million in PAC receipts, a group
seeking an overhaul of campaign finance laws said today.
   Common Cause, one of several self-styled public interest groups
lobbying for restrictions on PAC donations, said 44 of the 99
incumbent senators received at least $1 million in PAC money during
the six-year period.
   The totals were compiled from Federal Election Commission data.
Not included was the Hawaii Sen. Spark Matsunaga, who died earlier
this month.
   The four senators whose PAC donations from 1983-88 exceeded $2
million were Sens. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, $2.5 million; Pete
Wilson, R-Calif., $2.3 million; Slade Gorton, R-Wash., $2.2
million; and Phil Gramm, R-Texas, $2 million.
   Common Cause said finance industry PACs _ those associated with
banks, savings and loans and other financial institutions _ were
the top contributors during the six-year period. Common Cause said
the top recipient of finance-industry PAC donations was Sen. Donald
Riegle, D-Mich., the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who
received $344,000 in such donations.

   Cuba says there are no plans for Pope John
Paul II to visit the Communist Caribbean island nation in December,
contradicting a weekend announcement by the Vatican.
   Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Sunday as the pope wound up
a trip to Czechoslovakia that the Polish-born pontiff would visit
Cuba in December before Christmas, though not date has been set.
   But the official Cuban news agency, Prensa Latina, on Monday
quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying there is no such plan for a
papal visit. The dispatch was monitored in Mexico City.
   The Vatican last year accepted an invitation to visit from Cuban
leader Fidel Castro. In March, while on a visit to Brazil, Castro
said a visit by the pope was ``practically agreed upon.''
   However, he also criticized the Catholic Church in Cuba at that
time, saying it should dedicate itself to the people instead of
``assuming an anti-revolutionary position.''
   The pope encouraged the toppling of unpopular Communist regimes
in Eastern Europe and is now warning that region's newly freed
peoples to be wary of what he calls the spiritually impoverished
materialism of the capitalist West.
   Castro has staunchly defended his brand of Communism and the
improved living standards it has meant for Cubans, refusing to
embrace free market reforms encouraged by Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Mexican President Protests Doctor's Arrest In Camarena Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
denounced the alleged U.S. kidnapping of a Mexican doctor to face
charges in the slaying of a narcotics agent, declaring, ``You do
not uphold the law with illegal acts.''
   The Mexican president delivered his attack on U.S. actions below
the border at Monday's annual luncheon of The Associated Press in
Century City. The luncheon followed the news cooperative's annual
meeting.
   The meeting and luncheon, attended by publishers and editors
representing the AP's 1,486 newspaper members, were the opening-day
events at the 104th annual convention of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association.
   Salinas, who arrived under heavy guard, pointed to Mexican
arrests and convictions of 28 defendants in the 1985 slaying of
U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena as proof that Mexico needs no help
in apprehending the guilty.
   Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, who was brought to El Paso, Texas,
on April 3 from Guadalajara, Mexico, is one of 18 people under
indictment in the Camarena murder.
   A federal judge in Los Angeles has demanded an explanation of
how Alvarez came to the United States. If the doctor was kidnapped,
Salinas said, the incident could undermine the international
drug-fighting effort.
   ``This runs the risk of creating illegal habits among those who
have the obligation of defending the law and could create a problem
much larger than the one we are trying to combat,'' Salinas said.
   The Mexican government has complained about the arrest of the
gynecologist, alleging the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
offered money for the kidnapping and may have been in on the actual
plot.
   Alvarez is alleged to have been present when Camarena was
tortured and murdered at a Guadalajara house. Prosecutors allege
that the doctor gave Camarena drugs to revive him for additional
torturing before he was killed.
   ``The battle against narcotics traffickers requires
unprecedented international cooperation,'' Salinas said.
   ``But that cooperation, in order to be effective and real, has
to be accomplished with the strictest international respect and no
unilateral action against the law and rights of other nations,'' he
said. ``It is not with arbitrary acts by the pursuers that we are
going to combat the illegality of the narcotics traffickers.''
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has called for an
investigation into the doctor's arrest.
   DEA officials have denied allegations by Alvarez' lawyer, Robert
K. Steinberg of Los Angeles, that his client was kidnapped by
bounty hunters who were paid as much as $100,000.
   The AP annual meeting included a report to the membership by
William J. Keating, chairman of the AP's board of directors, and
Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager of the AP. Keating
is chairman and publisher of The Cincinnati Enquirer.
   Boccardi said that AP technology is advancing to meet the needs
of its growing membership, now at a record level.
   AP's electronic darkroom, which will replace the current photo
reception system, is on schedule and meeting pre-production testing
goals, Boccardi said.
   Full-scale installation of the AP Leaf darkroom is to begin in
September after summer field-testing. An installation schedule is
to be announced in June, he said.
   Boccardi compared the new technology for electronic handling of
photos to the computer terminal revolution in handling words. He
said it will mark a major step forward for newspapers.
   ``We will train your staff, and AP's service reliability will
stand behind the AP Leaf darkroom. It is the right step at the
right time,'' Boccardi said.
   He noted that darkrooms from sources other than AP could be used
with the AP Leaf, which will fully conform to ANPA standards.
   Other technological advancements are imminent, Boccardi added.
   By July 1, the AP expects to complete the conversion of its
entire highspeed system to deliver AP and supplemental copy to
members at 9,000 words a minute, Boccardi said.
   A customized stocks service that allows members to localize
market table pages is in print in a dozen member newspapers, and
the installation schedule for SelectStocks will be accelerated
through the rest of the year, he said.
   Boccardi touched on the plight of Terry Anderson, AP's chief
Middle East correspondent, who was taken hostage in Lebanon five
years ago last month.
   ``We continue to search for an end to his ordeal and pray that
recent optimistic comments will lead to his release,'' Boccardi
said.
   Also at the meeting on Monday, David J. Whichard II of the
Greenville (N.C.) Daily Reflector was elected to the board of
directors of The Associated Press, and five incumbents were
re-elected.
   They were James K. Batten, chairman and chief executive officer
of Knight-Ridder, Inc., based in Miami; J. Stewart Bryan III,
chairman and publisher of the Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch and The
Richmond News Leader; Ruth S. Holmberg, publisher of The

   Sammy Davis Jr., recuperating at
home from chemotherapy, got a boost from the birth of his second
grandchild and words of encouragement from Frank Sinatra.
   ``He told Sammy he wishes he was on the road with him again,''
said Susan Reynolds, spokeswoman for the two entertainers. Asked
how Davis was doing, she said only, ``He's resting.''
   Sinatra and his wife, Barbara, visited Davis on Monday.
   Davis' grandchild Sam Michael Garner was born Friday. Davis'
daughter, Tracy Garner, delivered the 7-pound, 1-ounce boy at a Los
Angeles hospital, Ms. Reynolds said.
   Davis, 64, was diagnosed with throat cancer in September. He
underwent radiation treatment, but the cancer recurred and he
turned to chemotherapy, which he completed March 13.

   Hundreds of people flocked to the 3,200-acre
ranch of pitcher Nolan Ryan to watch him sell off his beefmasters.
   The Texas Rangers hurler signed autographs and posed for
snapshots with fans Sunday as about 500 head of his cattle were
sold.
   When he isn't pitching, Ryan is a rancher, but he decided to
sell a purebred herd because he can't devote the time it requires.
Baseball, a growing family and a move to Arlington prompted Ryan to
sell the beefmasters.
   ``I could tell things weren't going to slow down where I could
give it the time and attention I needed to,'' Ryan said. He said he
will keep less demanding commercial herds on two other Texas
ranches he operates.
   Several hundred people _ some from as far away as California,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Louisiana _ came to consider
buying the beefmasters.
   Gross sales: more than $500,000.

   Moaning merchants and gawking passers-by greeted
Hollywood's arrival in the Bronx for filming of ``The Bonfire of
the Vanities,'' starring Tom Hanks as a bond dealer brought low by
the Big Apple.
   There were cranes, trucks, traffic jams and plenty of stars
Monday during filming at the courthouse.
   The movie is based on Tom Wolfe's best-selling novel of avarice,
ego and corruption. And the flames of discontent did leap Monday as
a 200-person movie crew worked.
   ``It's making everybody's life miserable,'' groused Nick Kavalos
as movie trucks jammed the street outside his delicatessen. ``The
bread guy had to park two blocks away and carry in my delivery.''
   The courthouse and its players take a prominent role in the
book, Wolfe's depiction of New York's lowlifes and high brows.
   Ed McCarthy, who works in the district attorney's office,
couldn't find a parking space during the movie hubbub. ``I'm parked
at a bus stop where some idiot will give me a ticket,'' he said.
   Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman and Melanie Griffith are also in
the movie.

   Patti Page, whose 1950 recording of
``Tennessee Waltz'' is the second-biggest selling record ever, has
been hospitalized with a sinus infection, her spokesman says.
   Page, 62, was admitted to Scripps Memorial Hospital last week
after develping a high fever from dental surgery, Alan Eichler said
Monday. She was listed in good condition.
   ``This not anything life-threatending by any means ... but it
became so bad she had to go into the hospital,'' he said.
   The infection forced Page to cancel an appearance as a presenter
in Wednesday's network TV broadcast of the Academy of Country Music
Awards.
   Page is scheduled to be married May 12 to retired aerospace
engineer Jerry J. Filiciotto.
   Page has sold more than 100 million records, including 8 million
copies of ``Tennessee Waltz,'' which trails only Bing Crosby's
``White Christmas'' as the best-selling record ever.

   The New Kids on the Block got a court order
barring three companies from using the pop group's name and
photographs in contests and promotions run on a 900-number
telephone service.
   The order Monday from U.S. District Judge William D. Keller
applies to Investex Investment Exchange Inc. and Media Promotions
Inc., both of Florida, and clothing boutique operator
Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc. of Delaware.
   New Kids on the Block still will pursue legal action against the
companies, along with Star magazine and USA Today, to collect $81
million in damages for alleged trademark infringement, said the
group's attorney, Philip Heller.
   Heller contends the companies used facts about the group and the
group's name during telephone calls made to a 900 number.
   Star and USA Today stopped using the group's name before the
injunction proceedings and were not part of the judge's order,
Heller said.

   Jimmy Stewart was treated to reverential
speeches and affectionate anecdotes during a tribute to his
wonderful life on film.
   ``I'm just grateful to you all,'' Stewart said after the Film
Society of Lincoln Center show Monday night.
   ``It's so much more than I ever dreamed of,'' said the
81-year-old Stewart, who has won two Academy Awards.
   ``I ask God to bless all of you. And when he takes your lives
into his editing room, I pray that he will be as kind to each of
you as you've been to me tonight.''
   George C. Scott, Dorothy Lamour, Maureen O'Hara, Janet Leigh,
Robert Stack, June Allyson, Jack Lemmon, and Kim Novak paid tribute
to Stewart.
   Scott said Stewart had the gift of making his roles unique.
   ``Can you imagine me, for instance, with a trombone, trying to
convince somebody I was Glenn Miller?'' Scott asked. ``Not only
have you filled our hearts but you've uplifted our spirits and
you've nourished our souls.''
   The tribute included clips from 23 of Stewart's films in which
he sang, confessed to murder, talked to an invisible rabbit, kissed
women and fought men.

<HEAD>Stocks End Lower, Dollar Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange made up some of
their early losses but ended lower Tuesday, while the dollar edged
up against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar finished trading at 158.15 yen, up 0.60 yen from
Monday's 157.55-yen close. It opened at 157.88 yen and ranged
between 157.85 yen and 158.15 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average, which was down 333.66 points
at the end of the morning session, narrowed its loss to 177.69
points, or 0.59 percent, in the afternoon, ending the day at
29,501.38.
   On Monday, the index lost 156.37 points.
   The Nikkei index began recovering in the afternoon as market
players began buying issues of Suzuki Motor Co., following a report
that the company has invented a new substance to detect the AIDS
virus, said Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader with New Japan Securities Co.
   ``There was little incentive to sell in the afternoon,'' he
added.
   Toshiyuki Nishiguchi, a trader with Daiwa Securities, Co.,
attributed the morning decline to an upswing in Japanese government
bond yields, as well as the market's wait-and-see mood ahead of a
week of holidays that starts Apr. 28 for most Japanese companies.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 86.01 Tuesday morning from 86.17 Monday. That raised
the yield to 7.365 percent from 7.33 percent.
   Nishiguchi said the Nikkei fell as much as about 340 points
within one hour during the morning when arbitrageurs sold spot
issues in an attempt to take profits from price gaps between the
spot and the futures markets.
   ``But after that, the index stopped falling any further, partly
because there was no market-affecting news to move in either
direction after a series of sellings,'' Nishiguchi said.
   Other traders said the the yen's weakness against the dollar and
a decline on the New York stock market overnight depressed the
Nikkei.
   In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate was moving narrowly
after the higher opening, which followed overnight gains by the
dollar on overseas markets, said Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with
Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   The yen also weakened in tandem with the West German mark
against the dollar, she said. ``But the dollar failed to rise
further because many investors are inclined to sell it around the
158-yen line,'' she said.
   Many players sold marks against the dollar following Monday's
announcement by West Germany that salaries and pensions denominated
in East German marks would be converted to Western marks at a
one-for-one rate, Takeuchi said. The plan was more generous than
West Germany had indicated previously and has aroused concern about
the possibility of higher inflation in Germany.

<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A seriously ill Elizabeth Taylor
battled pneumonia at her hospital, her breathing assisted by a
ventilator, doctors say.
   Hospital officials described her condition late Monday as
stabilizing after a lung biopsy to determine the cause of the
pneumonia. Analysis of the tissue sample was expected to take until
Thursday, said her spokeswoman, Chen Sam.
   The 58-year-old actress, who won best-actress Oscars for
``Butterfield 8'' and ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,'' has been
hospitalized more than two weeks. She was in the intensive care
unit at St. John's Hospital and Health Center.
   ``She is seriously ill,'' her doctors said in a statement.
``After surgery, her breathing is now being assisted by a
ventilator. Her condition is presently stabilizing and her
physicians are pleased with her progress.''
   Another spokewoman for the actress, Lisa Del Favaro, said Miss
Taylor's family was at her bedside. She did not identify the family
members.
   Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9
with a persistent fever and sinus infection, doctors said. Her
condition worsened and she was transferred April 16 to St. John's
and moved into intensive care on Friday.
   ``It is serious, but they are really pleased with her progress.
She's not well. She's not on her deathbed or anything,'' Ms. Sam
said late Monday.
   While it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator,
it does not mean that person is near death, said Dr. John G.
Mohler, a University of Southern California lung disease expert who
emphasized he had no direct knowledge of Miss Taylor's condition.
   Doctors may put a patient on a ventilator simply to restore
oxygen in the blood to proper levels if pneumonia-related breathing
difficulties have reduced those levels, Mohler said.
   ``It may be that because she is such a prominent person, they
are taking a conservative course,'' he added.
   Miss Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years,
particularly back troubles from filming of ``National Velvet' in
1945, when she fell off a horse.
   In 1983 she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills
and painkillers. Miss Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug
abuse at the Betty Ford Clinic.
   During a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961, Miss Taylor
underwent a tracheotomy, an incision into her windpipe to help her
breathe. She appeared at the 1961 Academy Awards with a bandage
over her scar as she accepted the ``Butterfield 8'' Oscar.

   A mule-drawn wagon carried the Rev. Ralph David
Abernathy to his final resting place as his colleagues praised him
for shouldering the burden of the civil rights movement for the
past two decades.
   The famous and the humble crowded shoulder-to-shoulder into a
church Monday for the four-hour service for the Martin Luther King
Jr.'s chief lieutenant and closest friend. Abernathy died of a
heart attack April 17 at age 64.
   State Rep. Tyrone Brooks said Abernathy ``was nailed to the
cross'' in his efforts to hold King's coalition together after the
civil rights leader's assassination in 1968.
   ``The assassination of Ralph David Abernathy began on April 5,
1968,'' Brooks said. ``He was crucified for 22 years.''
   Afterward, two mules, pulling a wooden wagon bearing Abernathy's
casket, set out from West Hunter Street Baptist Church, where
Abernathy was pastor, for Lincoln Cemetery.
   King's body was carried to its resting place by a mule-drawn
wagon in 1968 at the suggestion of Abernathy, who considered it
symbolic of humility. Family members said Abernathy wanted the same
for himself.
   Groups of people, some with children and pets, lined sidewalks
as the wagon inched along amid 150 marchers, including Abernathy's
sons, Kwame and state Rep. Ralph David Abernathy III, and civil
rights associates Andrew Young and Jesse Jackson.
   More than 3,000 people were on the cemetery grounds waiting to
file through a chapel there to touch the casket and lay flowers
beside it before it was placed in a mausoleum.
   At the chapel, mourners cheered as one of Abernathy's daughters,
Donzaleigh Abernathy Bosley, told them her father's last words
were, ``I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive forevermore.''
   Some of Abernathy's colleagues who had branded him a Judas
months ago for writing of King's alleged marital infidelity in his
memoirs were themselves rebuked during the funeral.
   Brooks said the civil rights movement should be proud instead of
embarrassed by Abernathy's autobiography, ``And The Walls Came
Tumbling Down.''
   Brooks, a student activist during the 1960s, stood in the pulpit
above Abernathy's rose-covered coffin and waved a copy of the book.
He urged the crowd of 2,500 to read it.
   ``It was not a mistake,'' Brooks said. ``It is the truth. All
636 pages.''
   Among those present were King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and
three of her children; Benjamin Hooks, head of the NAACP; U.S. Rep.
John Lewis, D-Ga.; Robert Kennedy Jr., and Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   Jackson said Abernathy's accomplishments far outweigh any
disagreement that came as a result of his memoirs.
   ``One cannot judge a player by one exceptional play ... nor can
a player be judged by an error,'' Jackson said. ``Ralph Abernathy
is in the hall of fame. We must pay homage and thanks.''
   Ralph David Abernathy III, his voice breaking with emotion,
compared his father to the Bible's David, saying he slew ``the
Goliath of racism.''
   ``I am the son of a giant slayer,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Derrick Bell, Harvard Law School's first
black tenured professor, is threatening to take a leave of absence
without pay until a black woman is added to the faculty.
   Bell, who first taught at what is considered the nation's
premier law school in 1969, was expected to announce his leave
today, said Keith Boykin, a spokesman for the student Coalition for
Civil Rights.
   Students at the law school have been staging protests demanding
more minority faculty members. Harvard Law has five black
professors, three of them tenured, out of a faculty of more than
60, Bell said Monday.
   ``I cannot in good conscience continue in a role that limits
rather than expands faculty diversity,'' he said in a statement for
release today. ``I cannot continue to urge students to take risks
for what they believe if I do not practice my own precepts.''
   Prior to the noon rally at which Bell was to make his
announcement, he and the law school administration were to hold
talks over the hiring of a black woman. Bell said Harvard has only
five female law professors, none black.
   Bell and the student coalition are urging the school hire Regina
Austin, a black woman who is a visiting professor at Harvard.
Austin has been offered a permanent post at the University of
Michigan, Boykin said.
   Bell is a former member of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee, a civil rights group. He first taught at the law school
in 1969 but left in 1980 to become dean of the University of Oregon
Law School.
   Bell returned to Harvard in 1986 as the law school's only
tenured black professor.
   Last May, during student sit-ins to protest what they called a
lack of diversity on the faculty, some students pushed to have Bell
named dean of the law school.
   Bell put the number of minority students at the school at 400,
with fewer than 200 of those black. Harvard Law School has about
1,500 students.
   ``The students have been urging greater diversity. I guess it's
been happening in many other places around the country,'' he said
Monday.
   ``Thus far, there has not been very much in the way of positive
response to demands given the administration a couple of months
ago.''

   An agreement that would provide dependents of
migrant workers with government health care in Mexico has been
signed by the Mexican government and the United Farm Workers.
   The pact was signed by UFW President Cesar Chavez and Ricardo
Garcia Sainz, director general of the Mexican Social Security
Institute, in the presence of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari.
   Salinas was in Los Angeles on Monday to speak at the annual
Associated Press luncheon.
   ``It has not been possible for the union to protect members'
families in Mexico with the union's medical plan here,'' Chavez
said. ``Now, with this pact, they are able to get universal medical
care at a very reasonable price.''
   Chavez said he had worked on the proposal for 17 years and
believes at least 100,000 dependents of migrant workers will be
covered by the Mexican government in the first year of the
agreement.
   The worker, the spouse, the children and worker's parents or
grandparents in their absence will be covered, Chavez said. Each
worker will pay between $160 to $200 a year to help defray the
health care costs in Mexico, he said.
   The services will include primary health care, specialists,
surgery, hospitalization, dental and vision care, obstetrics,
medication, X-ray and other diagnostic tests.
   ``This places on us the responsibility to respond with work,
with determination, with the full recognition that the well-being
of their families rests on our shoulders and that we must always
watch over it,'' Garcia said.
   ``With the protection which the Social Security will give to
their families, wherever they may live, the quality of life will be
enhanced and great opportunities for development will be opened,''
he said.
   Chavez said the agreement will be extremely beneficial to
thousands of workers who legally cross the border into the United
States for work daily and who are not covered in Mexico.
   ``I think this will be a good thing if it works,'' said migrant
worker Ramon Perez, who has a wife and two children in Morelia,
Mexico, about 200 miles northwest of Mexico City.
   ``Right now, we send them money any chance we can so they can
buy food and clothes and for medical care,'' said Perez, who was
among 50 UFW workers who witnessed the signing of the agreement in
a hotel conference room.

   Fair skies prevailed over much of the nation today, but
summer-like weather got thunderstorms rolling in the Great Plains
and the Mississippi Valley.
   Warm and humid weather in the central United States on Monday
produced temperatures in the 80s and 90s and hail in parts of
Texas, Arkansas, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Florida.
   A thunderstorm in Minnesota spawned a tornado near the town of
Benson.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across the upper
Mississippi Valley, with the strongest stretching from Iowa into
Wisconsin.
   The northern Rockies and the central Pacific Coast also got rain
Monday, but skies were fair from the Carolinas to the northern
Atlantic Coast.
   Thunderstorms were forecast in Kansas, western Texas and
Oklahoma today after tennis ball-size hail fell in Garden City,
Texas, and golf ball-size hail dropped on the Texas town of Dryden
and Swan Lake in Arkansas.
   A thunderstorm hit Minneapolis-St. Paul early today.
   Skies were cloudy in Miami; Fort Worth, Texas; San Antonio;
Fairbanks, Alaska, and Las Vegas.
   Temperatures climbed Monday into the 90s in North Dakota,
Minnesota and Texas. The nation's high was 94 in Presidio, Texas.

   Veterinarians undertook an emergency
Caesarean section on a 36-year-old Asian elephant, but the
266-pound calf was removed dead.
   Officials at the Burnet Park Zoo said Monday they weren't sure
why the calf, a male, died.
   The position of the calf's head had prevented the mother, Babe,
from delivering naturally, making the C-section necessary.
   ``Until the fetus came out of the uterus, it was a coin toss,''
said Zoo Director Dave Raboy, who gave the go-ahead for the
four-hour operation Monday by a medical team from Cornell
University and zoos around the country.
   The 7,700-pound Babe would have been been the oldest first-time
elephant mother to give birth in a North American zoo. She went
into labor Wednesday.
   It was the third C-section tried on an Asian elephant, and only
one of the operations was successful, said zoo spokeswoman Yvette
Pelletreau.
   In preparation for surgery, Burnet Park had gathered two
king-size mattresses, a one-ton chain hoist to lift the calf and
two five-ton chain hoists to lift Babe.
   The zoo world followed Babe's pregnancy because of the rarity of
captive births by Asian elephants, an endangered species that
numbers fewer than 45,000 in the wild. There have been just 62
births in captivity.
   Raboy said it was possible Babe, who was back on her feet hours
after the operation, could give birth again. Female elephants can
breed into their 60s. ``We have high hopes for the future. She's in
superb condition,'' he said.

<HEAD>End-of-the-World Group Ordered to Stop Building Fallout Shelters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVINGSTON, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A religious sect girding for apocalypse
has been ordered by a judge to stop building fallout shelters near
Yellowstone National Park after thousands of gallons of fuel leaked
from underground tanks.
   The order Monday came on the day that began what the church's
spiritual leader says is a 12-year ``dark cycle'' of global danger
and catastrophe, from which the shelters are to protect 750
followers.
   The order, requested by the state Friday, bars the Church
Universal and Triumphant from continuing construction on the
shelters near Corwin Springs, where the church has its headquarters.
   District Judge Byron Robb set a hearing May 3 on the matter.
   An estimated 31,000 gallons of diesel and gasoline leaked
recently from three tanks at the shelter complex. State officials
want work to stop pending an environmental review.
   The complex is surrounded by at least 35 underground tanks that
can hold 634,500 gallons of diesel, gasoline, heating oil and
antifreeze.
   Church spiritual leader Elizabeth Clare Prophet has prophesied
that planetary karma _ ``the cumulative weight of mankind's sins''
_ has been building for 25,800 years and would fully descend on
Earth as of Monday to begin a ``dark cycle'' of danger that will
last 12 years.
   In the past, Prophet said, cataclysm occurred when enough bad
karma accumulated. She said she remembers in a previous life the
continent of Lemuria ``breaking up in flames'' and sinking beneath
the Pacific Ocean.
   This time, she said, the bad karma could manifest itself in
economic collapse, nuclear war or accident, plague or great
earthquakes.

<HEAD>Stocks Down, Dollar Up in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed lower
today despite an afternoon rally, while the dollar rose against the
Japanese yen after a three-day decline.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average, down 333.66 points at the
end of the morning session, ended with a loss of 177.69 points, or
0.59 percent, closing at 29,501.38. On Monday, the index fell
156.37 points.
   The Nikkei began recovering in the afternoon as investors bought
shares in Suzuki Motor Co. after a report that it had invented a
new blood testing machine to detect the AIDS virus, said Kazuhiro
Nomura, a trader with New Japan Securities Co.
   Suzuki said today it developed the machine jointly with Dinabot,
a Japanese subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, a major U.S.
pharmaceutical company.
   ``There was little selling incentive in the afternoon, when some
investors picked up issues of companies with positive prospects,''
Nomura said.
   But trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 480
million shares, up from 330 million the previous day.
   Toshiyuki Nishiguchi, a trader with Daiwa Securities Co.,
attributed the index's early decline to a rise in Japanese
government bond yields, as well as the market's wait-and-see mood
before a week of holidays that starts April 28 for most Japanese
companies.
   The price of the benchmark No.119 10-year Japanese government
bonds closed at 85.82 points, down from Monday's close of 86.17.
Their yield reached 7.405 percent, up from 7.330 percent on Monday.
   Traders said arbitrageurs also were selling spot issues in an
attempt to make profits from price gaps between the spot and the
futures markets.
   Issues that attracted investors included food and
pharmaceuticals.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 158.15 yen, up 0.60
yen from Monday's 157.55-yen close. It opened at 157.88 yen and
ranged between 157.85 yen and 158.15 yen.
   The dollar had declined 2.32 yen in the previous three trading
days.
   The yen weakened slightly as market players sold the West German
mark against the dollar after West Germany's announcement Monday
that salaries and pensions denominated in East German marks would
be converted to West German marks at a 1-for-1 rate in the planned
monetary unification, dealers said.
   ``But the dollar did not rise quickly as many investors sold the
currency for profit-taking at around 158 yen,'' said Hisashi
Matsuda, a dealer with Daiwa Bank.
   He said some investors bought dollars based on news of growing
oil shortages in Lithuania caused by a Soviet economic embargo, but
most market participants were more interested in East-West German
developments. The dollar is considered a safe investment refuge in
times of economic or political uncertainty.
   The mark is still attractive to many investors because of
expectations of higher West German interest rates in the near
future, dealers said.

<HEAD>City Makes Accordion San Francisco's Official Instrument</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The much-maligned accordion is the official
instrument of San Francisco.
   The Board of Supervisors voted 6-4 Monday in favor of the raspy
squeezebox despite a last-minute bid by violin fanciers.
   Fans of the accordion said the instrument is just what the city
needs after the October earthquake. The message is ``we're a
lighthearted and bohemian city,'' said accordion player ``Big Lou.''
   Accordion players, who started their pitch several months ago by
wheezing away on the steps of City Hall, wanted their instrument
recognized for historical reasons.
   ``The first piano accordion made in America was made in San
Francisco,'' said Normal Kaline, whose Italian immigrant father,
Finau Piatanesi, claimed credit for the feat in 1908.
   The instrument plummeted in popularity with the advent of rock
`n' roll but is now making a comeback, said Tom Torriglia, who
plays with the local group Those Darn Accordions! He noted that the
group Aerosmith features an accordion in a new song and that Billy
Joel used one in recent San Francisco Bay area concerts.
   But all was not harmony among the music lovers.
   ``With all due respect to the accordion and to all my ancestors
who came here with the accordion, we also are the home of the
oldest violin factory in the United States,'' said Supervisor
Angela Alioto, who voted against the resolution.
   The resolution needs Mayor Art Agnos' signature to become
official, but press secretary Scott Shafer said, ``How could he
object to the accordion?''

<HEAD>Chinese Premier Meets With Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng, the first Chinese head of
government to visit Moscow in 26 years, met today with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev after stressing that both countries have the right to
tailor reforms to their own needs.
   Li's four-day trip is meant to promote good relations and ease
border tensions at a time when both countries, longtime rivals for
leadership of the communist world, are confronted with serious
domestic problems.
   On Monday, the 61-year-old premier noted in a speech at a
Kremlin dinner given in his honor that the Soviet Union and China
share a 4,300-mile-long border.
   ``Both are socialist countries and conduct reform and
perestroika in accordance with the realities of their countries,''
Peng said in remarks reported by Tass, the official Soviet news
agency.
   He went on to tell the dignitaries gathered in the Grand Kremlin
Palace that his country was committed to developing friendly ties
with the Soviet Union, despite differences.
   ``The reality in China and the Soviet Union are different, and
both sides have dissimilar views on a number of questions,'' he
acknowledged.
   Peng did not identify the areas of disagreement, but Western
diplomats in Beijing said China has stressed it will never again be
the docile Soviet ally it was in the 1950s, and they noted that
China's suspicions of Soviet aims have grown with Gorbachev's
reform policies.
   The ideological hard-liners who now rule China reportedly blame
Gorbachev for the fall of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and
see perestroika _ Gorbachev's reform program _ as leading to the
demise of socialism.
   Li was expected to hold at least two rounds of talks with
Gorbachev, who went to China in May. It was the first visit by a
Soviet leader in three decades.
   Tass said on this trip, the two delegations would sign an
agreement on cooperation through the year 2,000 in nuclear energy,
space exploration, wood processing, agriculture and metallurgy.
   Gorbachev's historic visit to China was overshadowed by
student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing, which ended
weeks later when Li and other Chinese leaders sent in troops to
crush the movement.
   In Moscow, Gorbachev now is contending with the crisis in
Lithuania, which declared independence March 11.
   China and the Soviet Union split over ideological differences in
1960 and fought a brief border war in 1969. In 1972, China restored
relations with the United States, in part because then-leader Mao
Tse-tung saw the Soviet Union as China's most serious military
threat.
   The last Chinese premier to visit Moscow was Li's foster father,
Chou-En-lai, who met Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev in 1964.

<HEAD>East Germany Pledges $3.6 Million For Holocaust Survivor
Counseling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's health minister says his
country will contribute $3.6 million to an Israeli foundation that
provides psychological counseling for Holocaust survivors.
   The announcement came Monday as East Germany ended two days of
remembrance for the six million Jews killed by Nazis during World
War II.
   ``We remember in this moment that six million Jews were murdered
in Germany's name,'' Health Minister Juergen Kleditzsch said in an
address to nearly 400 people in East Berlin's Synagogue Rykestrasse.
   ``The uniqueness of the murder of the Jews, which defies
comparison or settling of accounts, poses an obligation for the
politics of our country.,'' He said his government would contibute
$3.6 million toward the establishment of an East German committee
of Israel's Amcha foundation, which provides counseling for
Holocaust survivors.
   For decades, Communist East German governments refused to accept
responsibility for the Holocaust, saying Communists fought against
the Nazi regime and had themselves been victims of Nazi persecution.
   But on April 12, the country's first freely elected Parliament
said the state was prepared to make reparations to Holocaust
victims and urged the establishment of diplomatic ties with Israel.
   West Germany has apologized for Nazi atrocities and paid about
$49.7 billion in reparations to Jews.
   Israel has demanded that East Germany likewise accept moral
responsibility for the Holocaust, and agree to pay reparations
before diplomatic relations can be established.
   Holocaust Remembrance Day began Sunday when Jews around the
world gathered to mourn the death of the six million.

   Five astronauts boarded Discovery
today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into
orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to
the beginning of time.
   ``Astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of
what the Hubble will be able to accomplish,'' said Lennard Fisk,
head of NASA science activities.
   Air Force forecasters said there was a 90 percent chance the
weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the
scheduled time of 8:31 a.m. EDT.
   More than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid
oxygen were pumped into the space ship's fuel tanks after midnight.
The astronauts, wearing bright orange flight suits, climbed into
the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the Kennedy Space
Center.
   The $1.5 billion telescope, NASA's costliest cargo, will give
astronomers ``a new set of eyes and ears that we don't have,'' said
William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
   ``It's going to change our perspective altogether. I can't say
what we're going to learn, but I'll be astounded if we don't learn
many new things.''
   Discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a
shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper
orbit far above Earth's distorting atmosphere. It is the 35th
shuttle mission.
   Columbia, which journeys into space next month with the Astro
observatory, sat on a launch pad 1.6 miles from Discovery, only the
second time both pads have been occupied; the first was in 1986
just before the Challenger explosion.
   Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983,
delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident. The
latest postponement occurred April 10, when Discovery's launch was
scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit
on the shuttle.
   The mood at the Kennedy Space Center was considerably less
festive than during the first launch attempt, when hundreds of
astronomers gathered with their families.
   The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will
use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope
into space. Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn
Sullivan will assist if a problem develops.
   Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two days
until after its lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished
94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
   Hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by
satellite for a month or more after liftoff. However, NASA said it
will release its first image _ an open star cluster in the
constellation Carina _ a week after launch.
   In addition to the $1.5 billion cost of Hubble, $500 million has
been spent on spare parts, astronaut training and computer software
to operate the instrument. The European Space Agency contributed
$250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time.
   NASA estimates it will cost $200 million a year to operate and
maintain the telescope in space.
   During its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide
astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more
sensitivity than ground-based observatories. As a result, they will
be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been
traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.
   Astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15
billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery
surrounding galaxies, black holes and quasars. Hubble also is
expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end.
   The telescope is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,
who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding. His
work gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created
by a tremendous explosion.
   In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled
with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts
receive. It is the skull's third trip into space.
   The shuttle is to end its five-day mission with a landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

   She was described Monday as Miss Garbo's ``closest surviving

   The body of the 84-year-old Miss Garbo was cremated April 15,

funeral had been held and that final arrangements were incomplete.
   Kurz disputed published reports the reclusive screen star had

will be filed in New York City.
   The New York Post has said Garbo's fiscal prudence helped her
build up a sizable estate, consisting of several buildings in
Beverly Hills, an extensive art collection and the Manhattan co-op
where she lived.
   Film scholar Raymond Baum, one of Garbo's few friends, said
Garbo's seven-room co-op was filled with 18th-century antiques,
fine rugs, damask curtains and many pieces of art, including a

<TEXT>
   The dollar was stable in quiet trading today. Gold
prices rose slightly.
   Traders said they were waiting for new U.S. first quarter gross
national product figures to be released on Friday. The figures were
expected to confirm strong growth, and scope for higher U.S.
interest rates.
   On the political front, President Bush was expected to focus
international attention to the problems in Lithuania by announcing
limited sanctions against the Soviet Union later today.
   The increase in tension between the United States and the Soviet
Union was likely to propel the dollar higher as a safe haven
currency, some traders said.
   A stronger trend for the dollar ``is very much the tone of the
market,'' said Paul Brewer, a senior dealer at Salomon Brothers in
London.
   However, he noted that turnover remains fairly subdued and there
is little sign that investors are prepared to start taking any
large positions at this stage.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.60 yen to a closing 158.15 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 158.67 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.6977 West German marks, up from 1.6960
   _1.4895 Swiss francs, down from 1.4925
   _5.6945 French francs, up from 5.6930
   _1.9130 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9090
   _1,245.00 Italian lire, up from 1,244.00
   _1.1625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1610
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.6333, compared with $1.6365 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $377.75 a troy ounce, up
from $376.25 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $377.95.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $377.75, up from $375.85 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.99 to close at a bid $378.97.
   Silver was unchanged in London at a bid price of $5.09 a troy
ounce.

<HEAD>Soviet Union to Organize Flights For Moslem Pilgrims to Mecca</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has ordered special
flights this year for Moslems who want to travel to Saudi Arabia
for the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, a government spokesman said.
   Monday's announcement was the latest move by the Soviet
leadership to placate the country's 50 million Moslems _ a group
that has become increasingly strident as it grows in size.
   The Soviet Union has no diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia,
but Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze has been asked to
contact the Saudi government make final arrangments for the flights
and visas, said presidential spokesman Arkady Maslennikov.
   Speaking at a briefing for foreign journalists on Monday,
Maslennikov said Gorbachev had asked Aeroflot, the Soviet carrier,
to arrange special flights from Moscow, Kazan, Baku, Tashkent and
other cities in Soviet Central Asia for the Moslem pilgrims.
   Millions of Moslems from around the world make the hajj
pilgrimage to Mecca during the annual rites that take place in late
June and early July.
   However, only a handful of Soviet Moslems have been allowed to
make the hajj in past years, usually specially selected worshipers,
and not on direct flights to the oil-rich kingdom.
   There have been outbreaks of violence between Moslems and
Christians in the Soviet Union, most notably in territorial
disputes between the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Militant
Azerbaijanis have rioted along the nearly 500-mile border with
Iran, demanding reunification with their ethnic brethren in
northern Iran.
   Since the 1979 revolution in Iran, Soviet officials have
expressed concern about Islamic fundamentalism creeping across the
border. However, in 1989, the Kremlin agreed to foster contacts
between religious leaders in the Soviet Union and those in Iran.
   Maslennikov said diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union
and Saudi Arabia were not necessary for the special arrangement,
``but if diplomatic relations are established in the future, I
would consider it to be of mutual benefit to both sides.''
   Saudi Arabia and Moscow had full diplomatic relations until
1938, when dictator Josef Stalin closed his embassy in a
cost-cutting move. Several attempts during the 1980s to
re-establish ties faltered over what Saudia Arabia called a
``belligerent attitude'' toward Soviet Moslems.

   President-elect Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro will also take over as defense minister when she assumes
power on Wednesday, according to her family's newspaper.
   The paper, La Prensa, said the move would ``calm the spirits''
of both the ledership of Mrs. Chamorro's coalition and the
Sandinista army's high command, which would find it ``very
difficult to swallow the naming of another person.''
   Questions have persisted about whether the Sandinistas, who
dominated the country's political life for a decade until their
defeat in Feb. 25 elections, are truly willing to forgo control of
the military and security forces.
   On Monday, the Sandinista Front said in a statement that Defense
Minister Humberto Ortega had quit the party's nine-member
directorate.
   That left open the possibility that the brother of outgoing
President Daniel Ortega might be allowed to remain army chief.
   The Sandinista statement said that all other officers in the
Sandinista People's Army and the Interior Ministry, which controls
security forces, had quit leadership posts in the party.
   A March 23 agreement between Mrs. Chamorro's advisers and the
Sandinistas banned military officers from holding posts in
political parties. At the same time, the incoming administration
agreed to ``respect the professional status'' of the Sandinista
army.
   The idea was to prevent the Sandinistas from keeping control of
the military. The Contra rebels, who have been fighting the
Sandinistas for nine years, have resisted demobilizing unless the
army is purged of Sandinista functionaries.
   Leaders of the U.S.-backed rebels have agreed to heed Mrs.
Chamorro's call and disband by June 10, but there is some dissent
in the ranks.
   Many Contras have expressed fear that the president-elect will
not have firm authority over the army, that the latest changes will
not remove the army from Sandinista control. Some Contras want
their officers to replace Sandinista officers, which could lead to
conflict with still-militant Sandinistas.
   An estimated 9,000 Contras are inside Nicaragua and are expected
to move into cease-fire zones, where they are to turn in their
weapons under U.N. supervision.
   In Monday's report, La Prensa listed the makeup of Mrs.
Chamorro's Cabinet, which it said was chosen on Sunday during a
daylong closed meeting of the leadership of the president-elect's
United National Opposition coalition (UNO).
   The newspaper said the ministers would include Enrique Dreyfus,
the former president of the Superior Council of Private Enterprise,
as foreign minister; Antonio Lacayo, the president-elect's
son-in-law and close aide, as presidential minister; and Carlos
Hurtado as interior minister.
   Others listed were Francisco Rosales, as labor minister; Silvio
de Franco, finance; Jaime Cuadra, agriculture; Gilberto Cuadra,
construction and transport; Sofonias Cisneros, education; Ernesto
Salmeron, health; Silviano Matamoros, social welfare; and Francisco
Mayorga, central bank president
   An official announcement of Cabinet positions was expected later
today.
   That Cabinet will inherit an economy in shambles that was hurt
over the years by a now-ended U.S. embargo and ineffectual
Sandinista policies. Inflation last year was 1,800 percent, and the
foreign debt is $7 billion.
   Further complicating the task is the absence of consensus on how
to approach such problems among leaders of UNO _ a coalition of 14
parties spanning the political spectrum and generally united only
in their pre-election desire to topple the Sandinistas.
   The Sandinistas, who received 40 percent of the vote in the
February elections, are still the country's biggest single
political party.
   Nicaragua has been ruled by autocratic and oppressive
governments much of the time since it gained independence in 1821.
   Today, outgoing president Daniel Ortega said of political
changes in Nicaragua: ``I am happy because we are forging a
democratic process that was not previously known in Nicaragua.''
   But, in an interview with NBC, he said leaving office was tough:
``It does hurt, not so much for me but for my party.''
   ``There are some people who believe we gave up too much. ... but
it seems to me that only time will tell if what I have done as
president was correct,'' Ortega said.

   Millions of ravenous Mormon crickets so big
and barbed-legged that they stick in the craw of predator birds
have invaded Nevada in the worst infestation since the 1930s,
worrying ranchers and farmers.
   The federal government has joined the battle to protect the
region's alfalfa but had to postpone the start of aerial spraying
Monday because of rain.
   ``I got my own guy out there killing crickets because I don't
want to wait for the government to help,'' said Eldon Crawford, a
rancher near Golconda whose fields sit below canyons thick with the
insects, which can grow to the size of a mouse.
   ``I've had them for the past three years, but this is the worst.
I don't know how strong they're going to get. They're just babies
now.''
   The insects cover some 700,000 acres in five counties of
north-central Nevada in the worst infestation since the '30s, with
crickets counted at 100 per square foot in the worst areas, near
Winnemucca, said Dick Rowe, coordinator for the Nevada Department
of Agriculture's Plant Industry program.
   Rowe said the crickets are about three quarters of an inch long
but will grow up to two inches within the next month as they start
a hungry march across Nevada, eating everything in sight.
   ``They haven't damaged any cropland yet,'' he said. ``But the
federal government is putting on another crew to poison them within
a couple of days. Right now things are looking good. But it can
very easily get out of hand pretty quick.''
   Several dry winters and a lack of natural predators _ the
crickets get caught in the craw of gulls and other birds _ created
perfect conditions for the infestation, experts said.
   The juice-spitting insects, which can bite humans if disturbed,
got their name from an infestation in Utah in the 1800s. Legend has
it gulls from Salt Lake City ate the crickets to save the area from
destruction.
   For the past couple of weeks, the state Agriculture Department
has spread poison bran bait near hatching sites at the mouths of
canyons near Winnemucca, 160 miles from Reno.
   Martin Larraneta, department district chief, said ground and
aerial poisoning should control the crickets.
   ``The idea is to stop them before they get to the farms and come
into town,'' he said. ``I don't think it'll get that bad.''
   George Nash, head of the federal Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service plant disease and quarantine operation,
estimated it would cost $15 per acre for control measures.
   Farmers and ranchers will pay half the cost on private land; the
U.S. government, which controls most of the affected land, will
pick up the tab on public property.

<DATELINE>FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A photograph of the late singer John
Lennon showing him nude and in a fetal position was pulled from an
art exhibit by museum trustees, who said it clashed with the show's
theme.
   The portrait, taken in 1980 by photographer Annie Leibovitz,
shows the ex-Beatle next to his wife, Yoko Ono, who is fully
clothed. Trustees at the city-owned Muckenthaler Cultural Center
decided to remove it from an exhibit that opened Saturday.
   Beverly Gunter, chairwoman of the center's board of trustees,
said Monday the trustees decided the work was not appropriate to
the exhibit's theme, ``Heroes, Heroines, Idols and Icons.''
   ``It doesn't express `hero,' it expresses `anti-hero,''' Gunter
said. ``To me, to fit the hero show, something about the work
should be somehow a character strength.''
   The Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati and its director,
Dennis Barrie, have been indicted on misdemeanor obscenity charges
for an exhibit there of photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe
that include homoerotic images and naked children.
   ``I realize it might raise some questions, but it has nothing to
do with the Mapplethorpe issues,'' Gunter said Monday. ``I was just
trying to think of the appropriateness of the show. It only had to
do with a question on content of the show and my criterion was the
theme.''
   Norman Lloyd, the show's curator, said he wanted to include the
Lennon photograph because it illustrated an argument by the late
philosopher Joseph Campbell that the process of maturing is itself
a heroic act.
   ``It shows John Lennon in a very vulnerable position,'' Lloyd
said. ``It's basically that he hasn't grown up. It's a very elegant
photograph and shows that struggle people have of breaking away.''
   A portrait of the late artist Keith Haring, nude but covered
with body paint that matches the background, was included in the
show.
   The Muckenthaler show includes artwork by 25 artists, including
Thomas Hart Benton, Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns.
   Fullerton is a city of 110,000 people about 25 miles southeast
of Los Angeles in affluent Orange County.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Jump 6.7 Percent in March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
jumped 6.7 percent in March, the sharpest increase in two years,
the government said today.
   The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods _
``big-ticket'' items expected to last at least three years _
totaled a seasonally adjusted $128.8 billion in March following a
2.3 percent upward bounce in February.
   It was the largest increase in orders since a 7.4 percent gain
in December 1988. And it continued for a second month the rebound
from January's 10.5 percent decline, the steepest drop ever
recorded.
   The department said most of the boost was due to increased
orders for transportation equipment, saying that excluding
transportation, the advance was only 2.0 percent.
   ``The increase in transportation equipment in March of ... 21.0
percent to $36.2 billion was mostly attributable to aircraft and
parts, although motor vehicles and parts also had a significant
increase,'' it said.
   The gain in transportation orders was the sharpest since a 22.1
percent advance in December 1988.
   The closely watched non-defense capital goods sector, often a
barometer of business investment plans, jumped 14.9 percent to
$41.4 billion after diving 6.1 percent in February.
   Sharp drops in airplane and automobile orders were responsible
for the record decline in January, the department reported.
   Aircraft orders continued to slide in February, but a resumption
in autobuilding helped pushed total orders up. The department
counts car orders and production as the same.
   The auto industry had laid off more than 90,000 workers during
January to ease bloated inventories. Most of those workers returned
to production lines in February.
   The January report had been viewed as another sign of weakness
in the manufacturing sector of the economy. That sector has been
particularly affected by high-interest polices of the Federal
Reserve since many of the ``big-ticket'' items are financed by
loans.
   But the March report shows that most of that loss has been
regained.
   New orders for defense capital goods, a highly volatile
category, fell 4.5 percent to $7.3 billion after gaining 18.4
percent in February. Excluding defense, orders rose 7.5 percent.
   Orders for primary metals were up 7.0 percent to $11.7 billion.
   Non-electrical machinery orders rose 1.6 percent to $22.7
billion while orders for electrical machinery gained 1.1 percent to
$20.1 billion.
   Shipments of durable goods were up 1.5 percent to $125 billion
while unfilled orders rose 0.8 percent to $496.7 billion.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Thousands Mark Armenian Genocide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of Armenians flocked to a
hillside memorial in Yerevan today to mark the killing of more than
a million of their people 75 years ago under Ottoman Turkish rule,
residents said.
   Meanwhile, in Jerusalem's Old City 300 Armenians marched to mark
the anniversary. About 1.5 million Armenians were killed between
1915 and 1923, citizens of the Soviet republic say.
   Beginning at dawn today, Armenians marched toward the memorial
in Yerevan, the republic's capital, waiting up to three hours to
lay flowers near its eternal flame, said Raffi Hovannisian, of the
Armenian Assembly of America.
   Black flags and red-orange-and-blue Armenian national flags flew
from many of the city's buildings, he said from Yerevan.
   ``These people are looking into the past at the genocide, seeing
in some respect that it's been repeated in Sumgait and Baku and
elsewhere, and yet still looking into the future,'' Hovannisian
said. ``There's a combination of grief and commitment.''
   Scores of Armenians died in ethnic attacks in the Azerbaijani
cities of Sumgait two years ago and Baku this winter. Sporadic
fighting continues between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in the
disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   About 3 million Armenians live in the Soviet republic, and 1.5
million live abroad. Hovannisian said as many as 2 million were
expected to participate in memorial processions and ceremonies.
   In Jerusalem, marchers carried wreathes and candles as they
walked from the walled Armenian quarter to the community's nearby
cemetery. Armenian Church Patriarch Torkum Manoogian, wearing a
black hood and a crimson robe, led the procession.
   Dozens of teen-age marchers wore shirts emblazoned with the
words ``April 24, 1915,'' and many carried posters with slogans
such as ``End Turkish occupation of Armenia'' and ``Struggle is
born with every Armenian.''
   About 7,000 Armenians live in Israel, the occupied West Bank and
the community's walled quarter in Jerusalem's Old City.
   The campaign to exterminate the Armenians began late in the 19th
century under Ottoman Sultan Abd Al-Hamid II. It was stepped up in
1915 when the Armenians were accused of helping Russian invaders
during World War I.
   The Turkish government has a different account of the Armenian
deaths. Turkish officials maintain that between 300,000 and 600,000
Armenians died, most of famine or disease during forced deportation
to Syria and Iraq.
   The issue, dormant for decades, was resurrected in the 1970s
when Armenian extremists began more than a decade of attacks
against Turkish diplomats abroad, saying they were avenging the
massacre of their ancestors.

<DATELINE>YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evelyn Hill, who ran concession stands at
the Statue of Liberty for over 50 years and once lived at Liberty's
feet, has died at the age of 88.
   She died Monday at St. Joseph's Hospital when her heart stopped,
authorities said.
   Mrs. Hill became a concessionaire on Liberty Island, then called
Bedloes Island, after World War I, when she and her husband, Aaron
G. Hill, obtained a trinket concession stand.
   Hill was in the Army and they lived in Army housing at Fort Wood
on Liberty Island until 1934, when the Department of the Interior
took over the island and demolished the Army houses.
   Mrs. Hill, who was born in Warsaw, Poland, became proficient in
several languages because of her contact with foreign tourists who
visited the Statue of Liberty, said her daughter, Charlotte Libauer.
   Mrs. Hill's husband died in 1943. She is survived by a son and
daughter, two brothers, four grandchildren and a
great-granddaughter.

<HEAD>Police Break Up Anti-Communist Demonstration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINA PARVULESCU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Club-wielding police broke up a
demonstration today by several hundred anti-Communist protesters
who blocked a downtown square for the third straight day.
   The demonstrators, mostly young people, erected barricades from
wooden advertising panels and vowed to remain in University Square
until the government of interim President Ion Iliescu resigned.
   Some 400 steel-helmeted paramilitary police moved into the
square at 5 a.m. to disperse about 200 protesters, and began
beating them with clubs. Several demonstrators were injured,
witnesses said.
   It marked one of the few times since last December's bloody
overthrow of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu that Romania's
interim leadership has used force against anti-Communist
demonstrators.
   The demonstrators have occupied the square in varying numbers
since Sunday and blocked traffic in the city center. The square was
the scene of heavy fighting during the revolution that led to
Ceausescu's execution.
   The protesters contend that Iliescu and other former members of
the discredited Communist Party hold too much influence in the
country's interim government. Romania will hold parliamentary
elections on May 20, the first free multiparty elections in more
than 40 years.
   After the police action, protesters began to reassemble on the
square and by mid-afternoon, about 3,500 people had gathered and
began erecting the barricades again on the square outside the
Intercontinental Hotel.
   The demonstrators chanted various slogans, including ``Down with
Communism!'' and ``Down with assassins!''
   ``We came here to put communism down!'' a 73-year-old man, who
declined to be identified, shouted at the major commanding the
police who ringed the square at the end of a tree-lined boulevard.
   Meanwhile, Iliescu branded the protesters as ``thugs'' who were
inciting people ``to violence and hatred.'' He spoke at today's
session of the Provisional Council for National Unity, the
country's makeshift parliament.
   ``With such violent groups of thugs we cannot find (the road to)
democracy and impose (a new) civilization,'' said Iliescu, 60, a
former Communist Party secretary who was demoted to lesser jobs
after falling into disfavor with Ceausescu.
   Iliescu's remarks prompted shouts of ``Shame, shame, shame!''
from some members of the council who said he was resorting to the
same kind of terminology used by Ceausescu to describe opponents.
   ``You made a terrible mistake Mr. Iliescu,'' said Ion Lup,
deputy secretary general of the Peasant Party.
   Nica Leon, president of the Liberal Democratic Party and a
member of the ruling Council, said the protesters ``want the
(former) Communists toppled from the leadership.''
   In his speech, Iliescu appealed to leaders of the more than 70
political parties that have emerged since December to assume
responsibility and respect public order.
   Iliescu is head of the National Salvation Front and its
candidate for president in the May 20 elections. The Front's
leading members are former Communists who now described themselves
as reformers.
   The Front, which claims some 800,000 members, is widely seen as
the leading contender in the elections, drawing support from
industrial workers and former Communist Party members.
   Opposition parties accuse the front of advocating
``neo-communism'' or ``communism with a human face,'' saying its
leaders are following the policies of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.

<TEXT>
   President Mobutu Sese Seko today
announced plans to lift a 20-year-old ban on opposition parties,
following weeks of pressure from all sectors of society and Western
supporters.
   Mobutu said his Popular Movement for the Revolution, since 1970
the only official party, no longer would hold special status.
Initially, three parties would be allowed, Mobutu said.
   He also said the country's constitution will be rewritten and a
transition government set up to run the country until elections can
be held. The new government would be in place by April 24, 1991, he
said.
   Mobutu made the announcement in a speech to the nation, which
was carried by the official Zairean news agency.
   In recent weeks, Mobutu had been battered by a wave of
unprecedented criticism, the culmination of his own campaign to
gauge popular opinion. The country's Roman Catholic bishops
compared his rule to a monarchy.
   In January, Mobutu began a tour of Zaire, which is as large as
the United States east of the Mississippi, seeking public comment
on his rule.
   Thousands of replies came from business groups, churches,
unions, students and individuals. Many bitterly criticized the
government and Mobutu, accusing the president and his cronies of
corruption and monopolizing power.
   Mobutu did not reply directly to the criticisms in his speech,
but promised: ``the will of the majority will be respected. We will
proceed together on the changes wanted by the majority.''
   Mobutu, a 59-year-old former journalist and army sergeant, has
ruled the former Belgian Congo since Nov. 24, 1965. He renamed the
country, and made it almost into an image of himself.
   Although the Popular Movement became the only legal party in
1970, in the years after he took power Mobutu dissolved Parliament
and virtually eliminated opposition parties.
   Like most African presidents, Mobutu asserted one-party rule was
the only way to avoid tribal conflict. In the country's first five
years of independence, more than 100,000 people died in fighting
attributed to ethnic or regional conflicts.
   All Zaire citizens were made members of Mobutu's party, were
told to renounce their Christian names for African ones, and men
were required to replace Western-style ties with a high-necked
jacket.
   Under a policy of ``authenicity,'' Mobutu himself changed his
name from Joseph Desire Mobutu to Mobutu Sese Seko, translated as
``the all powerful warrior who...''
   Mobutu also nationalized key industries and replaced foreigners
with Zaireans at their helm. Production collapsed, along with much
of country's infrastructure. Mobutu was accused of plundering
Zaire's wealth. His critics say he amassed several billion dollars.
   Twice he needed major Western military intervention to put down
rebellions. International organizations and opposition leaders said
he brutally repressed any opposition.
   But the United States and other Western governments supported
Mobutu, who opposed the expansion of Marxism in the region. Zaire
has been a conduit of U.S. aid to anti-Communist guerrillas in
Angola, Zaire's southern neighbor.
   Mobutu's critics in the U.S. Congress, however, have said that
under better East-West relations, the U.S. no longer needs to
cultivate Mobutu.

   Hundreds of policemen deserted their
posts or stayed home today after anti-monarchist mobs beat to death
six of their colleagues in daylong rioting, government sources said.
   At least three police stations in the capital were seen to be
empty. Almost none of the capital's 4,000 policemen were walking
the streets.
   A few armed policemen entered deserted police stations late
today but allowed no one to enter. A 10-hour curfew restricting
people to their homes began at 7 p.m. and some policemen in jeeps
and trucks patrolled the city.
   Monday's violence was the worst since April 6, when police
opened fire on pro-democracy demonstrators, and threatened the
fledgling pro-democracy movement in this Himalayan kingdom.
   Until this month, King Birendra had exercised virtually absolute
power.
   Five civilians were killed by police gunfire in Monday's unrest
and, according to the state-owned Rashtriya Samachar Samiti news
agency, 15 policemen were missing. Only one policeman had been
found by late today.
   The mobs accused police of condoning and sometimes joining an
underground pro-monarchist group blamed for a wave of crime since a
new government headed by pro-democracy forces took office last week.
   Two policemen captured early Monday were beaten for more than
six hours before they died. Four more policemen were dragged from a
police station and lynched by hundreds of people.
   The crowds also set afire the zonal commissioner's office, which
houses a police station. Today, two policemen in riot gear stood
guard outside the charred building.
   They were the only policemen seen on foot during an hour-long
tour of Katmandu.
   ``There are no policemen anywhere in the city,'' said a taxi
driver who said he had been driving the streets for six hours.
``Even traffic policemen are absent today.''
   One government source said the policemen were either
``unofficially withdrawn or are too scared to come out.'' Senior
police officials could not be located for comment.
   But shops opened and streets were clogged with traffic today
after a ten-hour curfew clamped on Monday night was lifted at 6
a.m.. There were no reports of violence.
   ``The tremendous amount of confidence the people have in this
government is compensating for the absence of police,'' said Home
Minister Yog Prasad Upadhyay. ``This is apparent from the fact that
... the country is peaceful.''
   Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai met with King Birendra
today to discuss the situation, officials said. No details of the
meeting were available.
   A scheduled meeting of the Cabinet was postponed, officials said
on condition of anonymity. There had been indications a shake-up in
the top ranks of the police force might be forthcoming after the
Cabinet meeting.
   Bhattarai and his government, a coalition of democrats,
Communists, royalists and independents, took office last Thursday
after an eight-week campaign against the previous regime, which was
subservient to the king.
   King Birendra caved in to the campaign on April 8, two days
after police shot and killed 200 demonstrators as they marched on
the palace, according to witnesses. The government said 10 people
were killed and 107 wounded in all of Nepal on that day, but two
days later Birendra lifted a 29-year ban on political parties.
   Within 24 hours of the new government taking office, the capital
of 250,000 people was faced with a rash of arson, mugging and
looting, which residents blamed on a right-wing pro-monarchist
group called Mandale.
   The Mandale, an abbreviated form of Nepal Vidyarthi Mandal, or
Nepal students group, went underground in 1979 after Birendra
officially banned the group because of its violent tendencies.

   An Amtrak train was lurching from side to
side and going ``clickety, clickety, clunk'' before it jumped the
tracks, witnesses said. At least 91 people were reported injured,
three seriously.
   ``Last night it seemed like the train just wasn't going right.
It was kind of swaying so much it woke me up,'' Ruby Hall of
Forrest City, Ark., one of the California Zephyr's 394 passengers,
said Monday.
   The train, made up of sections that originated in Seattle, Los
Angeles and Oakland, Calif., was on its way to Chicago with a crew
of 24 when it derailed at the edge of this town of 500, about 90
miles from Des Moines.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
visited the derailment site early today but would not speculate on
the cause of the crash, ``not even rhetorically,'' said Dave
Watson, investigator in charge.
   Larry Allen, assistant transportation superintendent for
Amtrak's Midwest division, said investigators would try to make a
preliminary determination of the cause today, but cautioned:
``It'll take some more work before it gets nailed down.''
   Jasonna Gibson of Schenectady, N.Y., said she was holding her
2{-month-old baby when the train left the tracks. ``The baby
fell,'' she said. ``I tried to get him and a lady fell on me.''
   Eight passenger or baggage cars jumped the tracks: four remained
upright; three were leaning, and one, a sleeper car, was on its
side, said Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin.
   Crews today righted the derailed cars and were shipping them to
Fairfield, about 15 miles east, for inspection and repair. Crews
also went to work on the twisted rail and gouged right-of-way. An
Amtrak official said the double-track route would be open to
regular train traffic later in the day.
   The crew reported to local hospitals for drug and alcohol tests,
as required under federal regulations, said Michael Turner, Amtrak
supervisor of on-board services. Test results were not immediately
available.
   Kathy Hood of Littleton, Colo., said the ride was rough before
the derailment. ``This is my first train ride, but I didn't think
they were supposed to sway so much,'' she said.
   Paula Stater said she was in her home near the tracks just
before the accident and knew knew something wasn't right.
   ``I said to myself, `There goes that Amtrak making that stupid
noise,''' she said. ``But instead of going clickety, clickety,
clack, it was making a clickety, clickety, clunk.
   ``I looked out the window and thought, `Lord, I hope nobody was
killed.'''
   Asked about reports of swaying and noise, Gerry Hester,
transportation superintendent for Amtrak's Midwest division, would
not speculate on the cause of the accident.
   Mike Wenninger, a spokesman for Burlington Northern Railroad, on
whose line the train was operating, said investigators would
interview the crew and witnesses, check if signals were working and
examine the train's speed.
   Wenninger said the Burlington Northern line is kept in ``tiptop
condition and is inspected daily.''
   Ms. Martin said she does not know how fast the train was
traveling but its ``black box'' data recorder should help
investigators. The train is authorized to travel up to 79 mph in
the area of the crash, she said.
   Ms. Martin said 91 people, most of them suffering bumps and
bruises, were taken to hospitals, including 10 crew members.
Fourteen were admitted. ``None of the injuries has been described
as life-threatening,'' she said.
   Three seriously injured passengers were taken by helicopter from
the crash scene to hospitals, officials said. One was admitted to a
cardiac unit with chest pains, one had chest injuries and the third
a badly fractured arm, officials said.
   Ms. Martin said the train was running two hours late because one
section had to detour between Oakland and Sacramento because of a
gasoline spill.
   One car in the train had a car-length gash from hitting a
freight car parked on another track, witnesses said.
   Amtrak arranged for buses to take passengers to Chicago, where
other travel arrangements would be made.
   ``I got to go all the way to New York. I'm not taking a train
back,'' said Ms. Gibson, who joined dozens of other shocked
passengers at a community center where they were given food and
drinks.

   Freed American hostage Robert
Polhill spent most of his captivity in the same room as two fellow
hostages and probably in the same building as other Western
captives, U.S. officials said today.
   Some details of Polhill's captivity emerged as a special team of
U.S. investigators began questioning him today about what he knows
of other captives in Lebanon and the Shiite Moslem militants who
hold them.
   The 55-year-old business professor was reunited with his two
sons today for the first time in more than three years. They shared
a lunch of spare ribs, serenaded by a German accordionist, the
officials said.
   Polhill, a New Yorker, has been staying in a VIP suite at the
U.S. Air Force Hospital in Wiesbaden with his wife, Feryal. His
sons, Stephen, 26, and Brian, 23, arrived this morning from the
United States.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Polhill
was held in the same room with American educators Jesse Turner, 42,
of Boise, Idaho, and Alann Steen, 51, a Boston native. All three
were seized on Jan. 24, 1987, from the American University in
Beirut campus, where they had taught.
   Indian-born U.S. resident Mitheleshwar Singh, who was also
kidnapped from the campus with the three professors, shared the
room until his release on Oct. 3, 1988, the officials said.
   ``There's a possibility he (Polhill) was held in the same
building with other hostages,'' one U.S. official said. ``We're
fairly certain of that.''
   The official said he did not know which of the 17 Westerners
still in captivity might have also been held in the building. Seven
Americans are among those held.
   ``We know from various sources where the hostages have been
held,'' the U.S. official said, explaining that they were moved
regularly.
   Elsewhere, there were indications a second hostage might soon be
freed, though U.S. officials said they had ``no information'' on
that.
   And a London newspaper, The Independent, reported that several
dozen Shiite prisoners held in southern Lebanon by an
Israeli-backed militia would be released in the next few days as
part of a deal that won Polhill's release. Sources close to the
militia said Monday its leader would decide today whether to free
some of the group's estimated 300 prisoners to mark the end of the
Islamic Ramadan fast.
   ``According to the latest information that we have received from
Lebanon, maybe after a few days another hostage will be released,''
Iran's foreign mnister, Ali Akbar Velayati, told CNN in an
interview Monday.
   He did not specify the nationality of the hostage who might be
released.
   Hussein Musawi, a leading pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem cleric in
Lebanon, also said another of the 17 remaining Western hostages
might be freed soon. Musawi is thought to have influence over the
group that held Polhill.
   ``The possibility of another release is in the cards, but I
don't know when, how of for what,'' he told the Communist-run Voice
of the People radio in Lebanon.
   ``Such a step (Polhill's release) has to have a reciprocation.
It is not feasible that all releases would be made as goodwill
gestures,'' Musawi said.
   Tehran state radio in Iran said Polhill's release might be a
prelude to the release of other hostages but that Washington and
other Western governments ``must show goodwill.''
   At the base hospital, doctors said Polhill appeared to be in
good shape for a man who had been in captivity for more than three
years, but he was malnourished, mildly dehydrated and quite tired.
   Polhill's diabetes, which he has had for 25 years, ``is well
under control,'' the hospital said in a statement today.
   The hospital's medical director, Col. Dr. Kenneth R. Koskinen,
said Polhill suffered ``muscle wasting'' in captivity. He added
that Polhill was eating four meals a day to combat his malnutrition
and ``emptying our kitchen.''
   He added, however, ``He is intellectually very sharp, has a
great sense of humor, and considering his ordeal has a reasonably
positive mental status.''
   Polhill, an avid sports fan, has asked a lot of questions about
the World Series and Super Bowl, U.S. officials said. During his
captivity he had only sporadic reading material.
   Asked whether Polhill ever felt there was a moment he would be
killed, one U.S. official said: ``My understanding is that he never
felt that.''
   Polhill will spend several more days at Wiesbaden before
returning to the United States, Koskinen said.
   Polhill, frail and weary, carefully stepped out of a U.S. Air
Force helicopter at the American military hospital in Wiesbaden on
Monday to a tumultous welcome from medical personnel, soldiers and
civilians.
   A U.S. official denied any deals were made for Polhill's release
and said the United States had no information that a second hostage
might soon be freed. The official also said he was unaware of any
payments from Iran or Syria to the kidnappers to win his release.
   In a Monday editorial, the Tehran Times, a paper close to
President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, appealed for the release of
another U.S. hostage.
   In Lebanon, a pro-Syrian militia leader said today he was
working for the ``speedy release'' of two kidnapped Swiss Red Cross
workers.
   Mustafa Saad, leader of the leftist Sunni Moslem Popular
Liberation Army that controls the southern port of Sidon, told
reporters: ``We're in contact with several parties concerned to
ensure the speedy release of the Swiss captives.''
   The two Swiss, Emmanuel Christen, 33, and Elio Erriquez, 24,
were kidnapped by unidentified gunmen Oct. 6. Police and other
security sources blamed Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal,
whose movement has denied the charge.
   However, the group admits holding four Belgians seized in
November 1987 aboard a yacht in the eastern Mediterranean.
   Beirut's al-Liwa newspaper said today in an unattributed report
the Belgians would be released next week in a deal with their
government to free convicted Palestinian terrorist Said Nasser.
   Nasser, believed to be a member of Abu Nidal's faction, is
imprisoned in Belgium for a 1980 grenade attack on a synagogue. A
Jew was killed.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere today set July 2 as
the target date for the economic, monetary and social union of
their countries.
   While early July has frequently been mentioned as a goal, this
was the first bilateral announcement of a specific date.
   The announcement, read by West German government spokesman
Dieter Vogel, came as de Maiziere met with Kohl in his first visit
to Bonn as East Germany's prime minister.
   Delegations from East and West Germany will meet in East Berlin
on Wednesday to begin negotiations on monetary union, the Bonn
government announced earlier. Monetary union is a major step toward
uniting the two German states.
   The talks will cover Bonn's proposal Monday to allow a 1-1
exchange rate on wages, salaries and pensions.
   The 1-1 rate also would apply to savings accounts of up to 4,000
marks, or about $2,300, said Kohl spokesman Dieter Vogel. Savings
over that amount would be traded at two East German marks for every
West German mark. There had been reports West Germany was
considering the poorer rate for most savings.
   The East German government had demanded the 1-1 rate to protect
workers from higher living costs in a unified Germany and the loss
of huge subsidies that existed in the former socialist system.
   East German politicians applauded the wage concession but
criticized the limit on savings accounts.
   West German opposition parties said the plan would cost
billions, erode the West German mark and lead to inflation. West
German stocks plunged to their lowest level of the year after the
announcement.
   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said his country will
spend $35 billion to $58 billion over the next two years on
unification.
   Many West Germans, who vote in national elections on Dec. 2, are
worried they will bear the brunt of absorbing the crumbling East
German economy.
   The West German proposal is an ``important contribution'' to
ending the disagreements between the nations, East German
government spokesman Mathias Gehler said.
   But Wolfgang Ullmann, vice president of East Germany's
Parliament, said: ``If this is the final decision, there should be
sharp protest, because a large part of savings will not be
considered here.''
   Meanwhile, in East Berlin Monday, East Germany sent tons of its
own money to the trash-burner to make room in its treasury for the
crisp new West German currency it hopes will bring prosperity.
   Soldiers stuffed sacks filled with old, out-of-circulation East
German currency taking up space in the main treasury in East Berlin.
   The marks were carted off to the incinerator on Monday so the
government will have room for the new currency, expected to begin
officially circulating in the country by July 2.
   ``The East German mark will not be needed with the introduction
of the monetary union,'' said the East German treasury's chief
cashier, Horst Boettcher.
   In another step toward a single Germany, government sources in
Bonn said Monday the four World War II Allies _ the Soviet Union,
United States, France and Britain _ will meet with the two Germanys
for talks May 5 on international aspects of German unification.

<HEAD>Court Rules Guam May Not Be Sued Over Civil Rights Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. territory of Guam and its officials
may not be sued for allegedly violating a much-used federal civil
rights law, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The justices, by a 6-2 vote, threw out part of a lawsuit filed
by six Guam residents who said police punched, kicked and
threatened them to get them to confess to drug-related crimes.
   Writing for the court today, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said
Congress was most concerned about the Ku Klux Klan's influence and
race relations in Southern states when it passed the 1871 law.
   The law allows those who prove government actions or policies
violated their constitutional rights to collect monetary damages.
   ``Our review of (the law's) history uncovers no sign that
Congress was thinking of the territories when it enacted the
statute,'' Blackmun said.
   The six residents who sued Guam and various officials are
Palauan, natives of the island of Palau. They have their own
culture, language and physical characteristics.
   Their lawsuit alleged that racial bias sparked police brutality.
   A federal appeals court dismissed the residents' claims against
the Guam government, the Guam Police Department and the individual
defendants in their official capacities.
   Today's decision upheld the appeals court ruling, and
effectively reduces the amount of money the Palauans may recover if
they eventually win their lawsuit.
   The Palauans had sought $100 million in damages.
   The case is Ngiraingas vs. Sanchez, 88-1281.

<HEAD>Bush Will Give $2.6 Million in Medical Aid to Nicaragua</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will use his emergency
authority to provide $2.6 million in medical aid to Nicaragua as a
show of support for new President Violeta Chamorro when she is
inaugurated Wednesday, congressional and administration sources
said today.
   Bush's request for $300 million in economic aid to Nicaragua,
including money needed for spring planting of crops and for fuel,
is snarled by unrelated disputes on Capitol Hill and is unlikely to
be approved in time for Wednesday's swearing-in ceremony.
   The medical aid will provide a visible gesture that can be
announced by Vice President Dan Quayle when he attends the ceremony
in Managua. Mrs. Chamorro was elected overwhelming in February
elections to replace President Daniel Ortega of the leftist
Sandinista party.
   The medical assistance would be the first U.S. aid to the
Central American country in nine years, since President Reagan cut
off aid shortly after taking office in 1981.
   Mrs. Chamorro will take control of a country that is among the
most impoverished in the hemisphere and has been battered by a
decade of civil war and U.S. trade sanctions.
   Officials of the new government say they face a difficult
challenge in meeting the expectations of the electorate for peace
and a better standard of living.
   Bush is seeking $300 million as a first installment of aid for
the country, along with $500 million for Panama, which also is
suffering economic ills. But the aid package, a version of which
has been passed by the House, is being held up in the Senate by a
dispute over unrelated child-care legislation.
   The medical aid is being provided under a little-used section of
the foreign assistance law that permits the president to use up to
$10 million a year for ``any emergency purposes,'' so long as
Congress is notified.

<HEAD>Interior Department Proposes Shift in Oil Leasing Policy</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department is proposing a new
offshore oil leasing strategy it hopes will overcome congressional
opposition to oil development and open the way for more drilling,
department officials said today.
   The proposal was expected soon to be presented to President Bush
as part of a new five-year offshore oil leasing plan, beginning in
1992.
   The revised proposal is aimed at breaking the political deadlock
over expanded offshore drilling since President Reagan opened the
entire 1.4 billion-acre Outer Continental Shelf for potential
development, prompting outcries from environmentalists and many
congressmen.
   The new approach ``will be a lot more restrictive and lease
sales will go a lot slower than in the past,'' said Barry
Williamson, director of the department's Minerals Management
Service. ``It will be a 180 degree change of what we've seen.''
   ``We're taking a paring knife and we're going to narrow and hold
the process (of offering leases) down. We'll do away to a large
degree with the large area-wide leasing concept,'' Williamson said
in an interview.
   ``The policies of the 1980s as they relate to offshore leasing
are not working into the 1990s,'' said Interior spokesman Steve
Goldstein. He called the new approach ``much more realistic'' and
said Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan hopes it will open the way for
more offshore oil development.
   The policy change was first reported in today's edition of the
New York Times.
   Williamson said that instead of considering vast expanses of
offshore areas for oil development, the department would ``draw
boxes'' around areas that would be off-limits because of
environmental concerns. It would also single out areas where
development should be pushed because of indications the prospects
of finding oil would be good.
   Because the new concept would be more restrictive, it may ease
congressional opposition to the overall leasing effort, Interior
officials said. They said the areas that would be considered prime
for development have yet to be determined, nor how many acres would
be considered for drilling.
   Only a small portion of the country's Outer Continental Shelf is
used for oil and gas exploration, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico.
Congressional action has blocked development in vast areas along
the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and off Alaska.
   Bush is expected soon to announce his decision on whether to
proceed with oil leases in three of the most controversial areas
off the western coast of Southern Florida and off the California
coast. Environmentalists and local citizen groups have strongly
opposed drilling in the three areas.
   Officials said the new five-year plan would not be considered by
the president until after his decision on the California and
Florida leases.
   Under Interior's new approach, the initial step of any leasing
process would be to determine whether oil drilling or ship traffic
would harm marine life, and those areas would be withdrawn from
consideration.
   Only areas where there is strong geological evidence of a
potential oil strike would be put up for leases. The plan also
would share revenues from the leasing with coastal communities near
the drilling sites in hopes of easing local opposition, officials
said.
   The outer continental shelf, a submerged ridge of land, begins
three miles offshore. The petroleum industry has for years pushed
for offshore development but efforts repeatedly have been blocked
in most areas except in the Gulf Coast because of local opposition
and freezes on lease sales imposed by Congress.

<TEXT>
   The KGB has reinforced its units on the Lithuanian
border and increased patrols offshore, an official said today, less
than a week after the Kremlin cut oil and gas to the Baltic
republic.
   Also today, a five-member delegation dispatched from Lithuania's
capital, Vilnius, to meet with Soviet representatives in Moscow
failed to win an audience, one representative said.
   A Soviet government spokesman, meanwhile, warned that any U.S.
sanctions imposed on Moscow because of its economic embargo of
Lithuania could end up hurting the breakaway republic.
   Moscow imposed the embargo on Lithuania for refusing to rescind
laws meant to bolster its March 11 declaration of independence. The
republic was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   KGB Lt. Anatoly Parakhin, chief of the secret police's border
guard, indicated tighter security along the Lithuanian frontiers
was justified by fears weapons might be brought into the republic,
the Tass news agency said.
   Since Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev imposed the blockade
on the republic, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimeira Prunskiene has
been seeking supplies of petroleum from other countries.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev warned that
any U.S. sanctions imposed on the Soviet Union over Lithuania could
raise false hopes in Lithuania and have ``negative consequences''
on the international scene.
   ``Such types of actions could play into the hands of
unrealistic, ultra-nationalistic feelings, and they could hurt the
interests of Lithuania itself,'' Perfiliev said without elaborating.
   Perfiliev spoke before President Bush announced today what were
expected to be economic penalties against Moscow.
   On Monday, Prunskiene said Lithuania might have to sell some of
its gold reserves to buy the fuel needed to reopen stalled
industrial operations.
   The Soviet economic embargo forced the Lithuanians to close
their only oil refinery Monday and try to raise cash to buy fuel
from abroad.
   The refinery at Mazheikiai had been operating on reserves,
dispatcher Lidiya Cheblakova said from the refinery.
   Cheblakova said that with production stopped, the refinery's
2,000 workers were now idle. ``The mood is tense, worrisome,'' she
said.
   Soviet officials shut off the oil pipeline feeding the plant
from the Russian city of Polotsk last week and curtailed natural
gas supplies and shipments of other products.
   It was the toughest move taken in Gorbachev's effort to make the
republic of 3.8 million people rescind the laws seeking to promote
Lithuania's independence decree.
   The refinery produced gasoline for the republic as well as for
Estonia, Latvia and Byelorussia, processing about 12 million tons
of petroleum products a year of which Lithuania used one quarter.
   Lithuania has virtually no foreign currency to buy oil, but Mrs.
Prunskiene said Monday that the republic might cash in gold
reserves it has in France. She told reporters in Moscow, however,
that the idea had not been approved yet, according to Interfax, a
news service of Radio Moscow.
   Lithuania needs about $55 million worth of oil a month.
   The Bank of France said last month that it would return the gold
in its vaults to Lithuania if the French government recognizes the
independent state. Lithuania transferred gold now worth about $28
million to France as a precaution in the years before World War II.
   Mrs. Prunskiene told reporters in Sweden on Monday that she
opened an account at a Swedish bank to deposit foreign donations
for Lithuania.
   In Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, some bus routes were cut and
the main thoroughfare, Gedimina Street, was practically devoid of
vehicles as Lithuanians struggled with gasoline rationing that
limits them to about eight gallons a month for private cars.
   The Lithuanian government has urged all citizens to begin
conserving everything.
   A group of Western journalists who had been allowed to visit
Vilnius returned to Moscow on Monday. Virtually all foreign
correspondents were expelled from Lithuania on April 1, but about
20 to 25 Moscow-based Western journalists returned Friday on a trip
sponsored by the Soviet Foreign Ministry. Lithuania's small
Communist Party faction loyal to Moscow apparently was behind the
special trip, hoping to win coverage of its party congress on
Saturday.

<HEAD>Court Rules Distributors of ``Rear Window'' Must Share Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a ruling that could
affect millions of dollars in movie industry profits, said today
distributors of the Alfred Hitchcock thriller ``Rear Window'' must
share with a literary agent earnings from the film's re-release.
   The 6-3 ruling was a defeat for actor Jimmy Stewart and
Hitchcock's heirs. Some film producers claimed it could limit
availability of movie classics.
   Stewart, Hitchcock's heirs and others sought to prevent literary
agent Sheldon Abend from receiving a share of profits from ``Rear
Window's'' re-release in 1983.
   Abend paid Chase Manhattan Bank $650 in 1971 for the copyright
to the short story on which ``Rear Window'' was based.
   He sued in federal court seeking a share of the more than $12
million in revenue that the film has generated since 1983 when the
1954 classic was released again in theaters and for the first time
on rented video casettes and over cable television.
   ``Rear Window'' is based on a short story, ``It Had to be
Murder,'' by Cornell Woolrich that was first published in 1942 in
Dime Detective Magazine.
   The motion picture, starring Stewart and Grace Kelly and
directed by Hitchcock, had many elements not contained in the
original short story.
   Woolrich sold the movie rights to his story in 1945 for $9,250.
When he died in 1968, his property _ including the copyright to his
story _ was left to a trust administered by Chase Manhattan.
   Abend said the re-release of ``Rear Window'' infringed on his
copyright, and he also said the film distributors interfered with
his plans to contract with Home Box Office cable TV for a new play
and TV version of the story.
   The Supreme Court today upheld a federal appeals court ruling in
Abend's favor. The case now goes back to a lower court to determine
how much money Abend will receive.
   The justices reached their decision by interpreting federal
copyright law.
   Before 1976, a 1909 law permitted a copyright to be renewed for
28 years after the initial 28-year copyright period ended.
   The law was amended in 1976 to provide for copyright protection
for the life of the author plus 50 years _ but only to works
copyrighted after Jan. 1, 1978.
   The high court said Abend is entitled to copyright renewal
protection even though Woolrich died before the short story
copyright was renewed.
   The law is aimed at giving an author a second chance to make a
profit on a creative work _ and to leave the money to one's heirs
or executors in case the author dies before the copyright is
renewed, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court.
   Today's ruling does not let Abend block distribution of ``Rear
Window.''
   Nonetheless, some of the nation's leading motion picture
producing companies who supported the appeal by Stewart and
Hitchcock's heirs said a victory for Abend could mean that
thousands of films based on books, plays and short stories might
have to be withdrawn from distribution. More likely, it means they
could have to share profits from the films with copyright holders.
   O'Connor was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and Anthony M. Kennedy. Dissenting were
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens
and Antonin Scalia.
   The case is Stewart vs. Abend, 88-2102.

<HEAD>Man Gets Life for 1957 Killing of Cousin</HEAD>

   More than 32 years after an 11-year-old boy
was sodomized and hanged, the victim's cousin has been sentenced to
life in prison for the murder.
   ``We're very relieved that it's over,'' Mildred Ruff, the
victim's mother, said after Monday's sentencing of Richard Ruff.
``May God have mercy on his soul.''
   Ruff, 53, was convicted on March 23 of first-degree felony
murder for the death of 11-year-old William Ruff Jr.
   William Ruff was killed on Aug. 31, 1957, and was found the next
day hanging from a tree in a wooded area near his home in the
Albany suburb of Colonie.
   Prosecutors said the conviction concludes the longest homicide
investigation in New York state history.
   Ruff maintained his innocence during the sentencing. ``I just
never sodomized nobody. I never killed anybody,'' he said. ``...
And that's the truth.''
   Albany County Court Judge Thomas Keegan ordered the sentence to
run consecutively with a 4- to 12-year stretch Ruff is serving for
sexually abusing two young daughters of a woman he lived with in
Rensselaer County.
   Keegan turned down a motion by Public Defender Joseph McCoy to
dismiss the conviction on the grounds of insufficient evidence.
McCoy said his office would appeal.
   ``We're elated that the judge gave the maximum sentence,'' Chief
Assistant District Attorney Daniel S. Dwyer said outside the
courtroom. Dwyer said he would write a letter urging that the state
parole board keep Ruff in state prison when he becomes eligible for
parole in 22 years.
   ``This man's shadow should never be cast in society,'' he said.
   Ruff was not even considered a suspect in the killing until two
years ago. In 1988, Christopher Ruff, a brother of the victim who
is now an Albany County sheriff's deputy, noticed a police bulletin
indicating his cousin was wanted in connection with a child
sex-abuse case in Rensselaer County.
   Police found Ruff in Florida and questioned him for both the
William Ruff case and the Rensselaer County sexual abuse case
before he was brought back to Albany.
   Dwyer based much of his case on statements Ruff made to police
in Florida in which he confessed killing his cousin.
   ``This defendant summarily executed this boy,'' Dwyer said.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, ruling today in the case of
an Arkansas mass murderer, allowed states to execute convicted
murderers even if no appeals court reviews the validity of their
convictions or death sentences.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices threw out an appeal filed for _ but
not by _ R. Gene Simmons, sentenced to death for killing 16
relatives and acquaintances in 1987.
   The court said such an appeal cannot be filed by a fellow death
row inmate.
   Simmons says he wants to be executed, and refuses to appeal his
murder convictions or death sentence.
   Lawyers for Arkansas death row inmate Jonas H. Whitmore argued
that state appeals courts must review all death sentences, even
when not asked to do so by the condemned murderer.
   Writing for the court today, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
said Whitmore lacks the proper legal standing to mount a challenge
in Simmons' behalf.
   The court rejected arguments by Whitmore's lawyers that the
uniqueness of the death penalty and society's interest in its
proper imposition justifies some kind of relaxed legal-standing
standard.
   ``The short answer to this suggestion is that the requirement of
a ... case or controversy is not merely a traditional rule or
practice but rather is imposed directly by the Constitution,''
Rehnquist said.
   ``It is not for this court to employ untethered notions of what
might be good public policy to expand our jurisdiction in an
appealing case,'' he said.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan, who oppose
capital punishment under all circumstances, dissented.
   Writing for the two, Marshall said, ``The court today allows a
state to execute a man even though no appellate court has reviewed
the validity of his conviction or sentence.''
   ``The court does not address the constitutional claim presented
by (Whitmore) _ whether a state must provide appellate review in a
capital case despite the defendant's desire to waive such review,''
Marshall said. ``Rather, it decides (Whitmore) does not have the
standing to raise that issue before this court.''
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Said, in a ruling that could affect millions of dollars in
movie industry profits, that distributors of the Alfred Hitchcock
thriller ``Rear Window'' must share with a literary agent earnings
from the film's re-release.
   The 6-3 ruling was a defeat for actor Jimmy Stewart and
Hitchcock's heirs. Some film producers claimed it could limit
availability of movie classics.
   _ Ruled that the U.S. territory of Guam and its officials may
not be sued for allegedly violating a much-used federal civil
rights law.
   The justices, by a 6-2 vote, threw out part of a lawsuit filed
by six Guam residents who said police punched, kicked and
threatened them to get them to confess to drug-related crime.
   The law allows those who prove government actions or policies
violated their constitutional rights to collect monetary damages.
   In what prosecutors called a murderous rampage in the little
town of Russellville, Simmons gunned down his wife, three sons,
four daughters, a son-in-law, a daughter-in-law, four grandchildren
and two acquaintances within a few days of Christmas 1987.
   Simmons, 49, refused to appeal his convictions and death
sentence, saying he wanted to die by lethal injection as quickly as
possible.
   Three days before Simmons was to die March 16, 1989, Whitmore
sought to challenge the state's death penalty law in Simmons'
behalf.
   On the eve of the execution, the nation's highest court
postponed Simmons' death to study Whitmore's argument that the
Constitution requires state appeals courts to review all death
sentences, even when the convicted defendant asks to die.
   By ruling that Whitmore lacked the legal standing to appeal in
Simmons' behalf, the court cleared the way for Arkansas authorities
to execute Simmons without the validity of his conviction or
sentence ever being reviewed by an appeals court.
   After rejecting Whitmore's standing to press the appeal in his
individual capacity, the court rejected his attempt to press it as
a ``next friend'' of Simmons.
   The legal concept of ``next friend'' is employed by the courts
when prison inmates are incapable, usually because of mental
incompetence, to appeal in their own behalf.
   ``We hold that Whitmore, having failed to establish that Simmons
is unable to proceed on his own behalf, does not have standing to
proceed as `next friend' of Ronald Gene Simmons,'' Rehnquist said.
   The death-appeal case is Whitmore vs. Arkansas, 88-7146.

<HEAD>28 Officers Executed After Coup Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military firing squad executed 28
officers, including three retired generals and a brigadier, after a
summary court-martial on charges of trying to seize power in a
coup, official media reported.
   A statement broadcast on the government's Radio Omdurman said a
colonel was acquitted but a court-martial was continuing for other
officers alleged to have participated in the two-stage coup attempt.
   Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir's ruling junta, which took power
in its own coup last June 30, said an attempt crushed Monday was
the second phase of a coup plot originally put down in March.
   Government spokesmen said 30 officers were brought before the
court-martial after their arrest Monday. They said 20 officers and
civilians arrested after the March incident also were on trial.
   In announcing the firing-squad executions of the 28, Radio
Omdurman did not specify how many remained in the dock.
   ``Death by firing squad has been implemented, and the trials are
still going on for the rest of the participants'' in the alleged
coup plot, said the statement read on Radio Omdurman and
distributed by the Sudan News Agency.
   The statement did not say where the death sentences were carried
out.
   It also was unclear why Col. Hassan Abdalla Atta, a pilot, was
acquitted. There were reports that he was granted clemency in
exchange for testifying against the others.
   The executed officers included the two retired senior officers
accused by the government of being leaders of the alleged plot.
They and the others were charged with ``high treason and mutiny
against the legitimate government.''
   First word of the summary court-martial came late Monday night
in a statement read over official government television. It
interrupted regular broadcasts to say the tribunal ``already
started trying the plotters'' captured after their failed power
grab on Monday in the northeast African country.
   The government said the coup leaders were retired Maj. Gen.
Abdul-Kadir al-Kadaru and Brigadier Mohammed Osman Hamid Karrar.
Other retired flag officers reported executed were retired Gens.
Khalid al-Zain Ali, a pilot, and Osman Idris Balol.
   In addition, four colonels, one retired, and five lieutenant
colonels, two of whom were retired, went before the firing squad.
The junior officers on the list were three captains.
   Seventeen of the 28 were on active duty. The others were retired.

   A hand-grenade attack at a police station
injured three people, and five men were arrested after a car ran a
blockade in separate incidents on the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation,
state police said.
   The grenade was thrown Monday night into a crowd outside the
Mohawk police station on the Canadian side of the reservation,
which straddles the U.S.-Canadian border, said Mohawk
representative Tim Thompson.
   There has been sporadic violence on the reservation since last
summer, when state police and FBI agents raided St. Regis' illegal
casinos and arrested 13 people. Anti-gambling forces last month set
up blockades to keep out visitors who come by the busload.
   The five men arrested after driving into a blockade late Monday
were charged with criminal possession of a weapon, state trooper
Jay Plumb said in Massena. He said the men _ Alex Garrow, 19;
Kenneth King, 22; Paul Thomas, 22; James Davis Jr., 29; and Robert
Skidder, 53 _ were members of the Warrior Society, a
self-proclaimed security force that supports gambling.
   No arrests were made in the grenade incident, which hospitalized
a 16-year-old boy with a severe wrist injury, Thompson said.

<HEAD>Man Indicted in Letelier Assassination Wants Lawyer Who Won Other

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man indicted in the assassination of onetime
Chilean Ambassador Orlando Letelier wants to be represented by a
lawyer who won acquittal for another defendant in the case.
   Jose Dionisio Suarez Esquivel appeared in U.S. District Court
today, accompanied by New York attorney Paul Goldberger.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Marcy said Goldberger's entry into
the case would present ``a very serious'' conflict of interest.
   Goldberger represented Guillermo Novo Sampol, who was tried and
acquitted in the Letelier case eight years ago.
   Marcy said Novo is a potential government witness against
Suarez, but Goldberger said he doubted prosecutors would call his
former client, who lives in the Miami area.
   U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson said he will address
the question of conflict of interest once Suarez's family decides
that they want to hire Goldberger. A decision is expected in the
next week. Currently, court-appointed lawyer Ed Sussman is
representing Suarez.
   Suarez, arrested April 11 in St. Petersburg, Fla., had been a
fugitive since his indictment in 1978.
   He is accused of murdering a foreign official and of four other
charges in the 1976 car bombing of Letelier, Chile's ambassador to
Washington from 1970 to 1973 under the Marxist government of
Salvador Allende.
   Also indicted were the two top officials in Chile's intelligence
service during the military rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The
Chilean courts have refused to extradite the two ex-intelligence
officials.

<TEXT>
   A pro-Syrian militia leader said today he
was working for the ``speedy release'' of two kidnapped Swiss Red
Cross workers amid newspaper reports that they and four Belgian
captives will be freed soon.
   Speculation about the release of more Western hostages
intensified after American hostage Robert Polhill was released
Sunday after 39 months in captivity in Lebanon. Seventeen Western
hostages, including seven Americans, are believed held in Lebanon.
   Mustafa Saad, leader of the leftist Sunni Moslem Popular
Liberation Army that controls the southern port of Sidon, told
reporters: ``We're in contact with several parties concerned to
ensure the speedy release of the Swiss captives.''
   The two Swiss, Emmanuel Christen, 33, and Elio Erriquez, 24, who
ran an orthopedic center for Lebanese civil war victims for the
International Committee of the Red Cross in Sidon, were kidnapped
by unidentified gunmen last Oct. 6.
   Saad appealed to the kidnappers to free the Swiss hostages by
the end of the holy Moslem fasting month of Ramadan, which is
expected to end Wednesday or Thursday, depending on when the new
crescent moon marking the end of the lunar month is sighted.
   In Geneva, Switzerland, Juerg Bischoff, a spokesman of the
all-Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross, said today that
``our hopes are rising'' for the release of the pair.
   ``Saad is our main contact in Sidon, he is the most influiential
political leader there and he knows what's going on,'' Bischoff
said.
   Saad, who has helped mediate earlier hostage releases in
southern Lebanon, did not specify which groups he has contacted
regarding the release of the Swiss.
   Police and other security sources have blamed Palestinian
terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal for kidnapping the Red Cross
workers. Their abduction is believed to be linked to the
imprisonment in Switzerland of Hussein Hariri, 22, a Lebanese
Shiite, who hijacked an Air Afrique jetliner in 1987 and killed a
French passenger.
   Abu Nidal's group has denied involvement in the abduction of the
two Swiss. But it admits holding four Belgians seized in November
1987 aboard a yacht in the Mediterranean Sea.
   The Belgians are Emmanuel Houtekins, 43, his wife Godlieve Kuts,
their son Laurent and daughter Valerie, both in their teens.
   Beirut's al-Liwa newspaper said in an unattributed report that
the Belgians would be released next week in a deal between Abu
Nidal's group and the Brussels government.
   As part of the deal, Belgium would release convicted Palestinian
terrorist Said Nasser, who was imprisoned for a 1980 grenade attack
on a Jewish synagogue.
   Al-Liwa said Nasser ``completes half of his prison sentence in
mid-May'' and noted that the Belgian government will refer his case
to the Supreme Court which ``would release him by May 17.''
   Abu Nidal's group, the Libyan-backed Fatah-Revolutionary Council
released three other hostages captured with the Belgians on the
yacht on April 10 following an appeal from Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi.

   Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi may have paid
too much when he bought 38 paintings from Imelda Marcos for $6.5
million, an art expert testified.
   Ian Glenn Kennedy, a senior vice president at Christie's auction
house, testified Monday at the fraud trial of Mrs. Marcos and
Khashoggi that 26 of the paintings had a combined value in 1986 of
$1.7 million to $2.7 million.
   Khashoggi has said he paid Mrs. Marcos $6.5 million for the
paintings as a favor because she and her late husband, former
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, needed money. Twenty-six of
the paintings were seized in 1987 in France at the urging of the
United States.
   The financier said he did not have the paintings appraised and
acknowledges paying more than they were worth. He said in an
interview last week, ``If you saw the paintings you wouldn't buy
them for a dollar. You wouldn't hang them on the walls tastewise.''
   None of the works' painters or titles has been identified in
court.
   As the trial resumed in U.S. District Court today, a lawyer,
Peter W. Williams, explained the process through which the Marcoses
acquired the Crown Building on Fifth Avenue in 1981 for $51 million.
   Williams said the deal was conducted through a series of banks
and corporations in the United States, Switzerland, the Netherlands
Antilles, Panama and the Philippines.
   Prosecutors claim the Marcoses bought the paintings, as well as
four Manhattan buildings, with money embezzled from the Philippine
treasury.
   Khashoggi is accused of forging documents to help the Marcoses
conceal their ownership of the paintings and real estate in
violation of a 1986 U.S. court order freezing any transactions
involving Marcos-owned properties.
   Khashoggi's attorneys say his dealings with the Marcoses
occurred prior to the injunction; prosecutors allege Khashoggi
backdated the documents to skirt the court order.
   Kennedy, an expert in Old Master paintings, said that the value
of the 26 works of art had risen in 1990 to between $4.1 million
and $6.1 million.
   Kennedy testified after Christian Rene LeBeau, an officer with
the French Judicial Police's art theft unit, identified 26 of the
38 paintings as the ones seized in 1987 in Paris and Cannes.
   Mrs. Marcos is charged with racketeering, conspiracy, mail fraud
and obstruction. Her husband, who also was charged in the 1988
indictment, died in September. Khashoggi is charged with
obstruction and mail fraud.

   An underground environmental group
claims responsibility for vandalism that cut power to 92,000
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric customers.
   Hand-written messages delivered Monday to several media
organizations apologized to those who were without power for six
hours Sunday and early Monday in Santa Cruz County but asked for
understanding for the action by the Earth Night Action Group.
   The message, delivered in a plain white envelope, blamed PG&amp;E
for ``recent buy-outs of solar energy companies (and) exposes
PG&amp;E's attempt to shelter the public from environmentally safe
sources of energy ... E.N.A.G. apologizes for inconvenience, but
asks public to consider the destruction the earth endures to
provide electricity.''
   A young male caller to The Associated Press telephoned a few
minutes after delivery of the message to ask if it had been
received. Similar copies of the message went to Bay City News
Service and the San Francisco Examiner. The caller refused to give
his name or his telephone number.
   The vandalism, in which a wooden utility pole was cut and a
steel transmission tower toppled, was the first sabotage directed
against PG&amp;E since a series of power substation bombings in the
mid-1970s, said utility spokesman Ron Rutkowski.
   ``Our only comment is that PG&amp;E and various law enforcement
agencies aim at identifying apparent sabotage to PG&amp;E power lines
..., and (the power outage) inconvenienced thousands of families,
businesses, schools and government offices,'' PG&amp;E spokeswoman Jan
Stewart said.

<HEAD>Former Kosovo Communist Leader, 13 Other Ethnic Albanians
Acquitted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TITOVA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen prominent ethnic
Albanians, including the former Communist Party leader of troubled
Kosovo province, were acquitted today on charges of inciting
anti-government protests.
   It was considered the biggest political trial in this Balkan
nation in four decades. The trial had been widely criticized by
Yugoslav and Western human rights groups.
   Chief judge Ismet Emra acquitted Azem Vlasi, Kosovo's former
Communist Party chief, and the 13 other defendants. He cited a lack
of evidence.
   Public prosecutor Spasoje Zamfirovic indicated he would demand a
retrial, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians, chanting ``Azem, Azem!''
celebrated the acquittals, as riot police stood by.
   Police also patrolled other major towns in the province to
prevent ethnic clashes between Albanians and Serbs. No major
incidents were reported, although some Vlasi supporters reportedly
threw stones at police.
   Serbs, who represent a minority in Kosovo, received the verdict
``with disappointment,'' Belgrade radio reported.
   Ethnic Albanians have been seeking more autonomy for Kosovo,
which is part of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
   Vlasi's acquittal was seen as a defeat for Serbia's hard-line
Communist President Slobodan Milosevic, a key advocate of holding
the trial.
   The government had originally accused Vlasi and the other
defendants of ``counter-revolutionary activities'' for instigating
a wave of protests by ethnic Albanians last winter.
   The indictment charged that the protests eventually led to an
armed insurrection that resulted in many deaths.
   Last week, the charges against the 14 defendants were modified
to remove the threat of the death penalty.
   Vlasi, who was arrested in March 1989, was released after the
sentence was announced.
   ``This is a victory for justice in Yugoslavia,'' a tearful Vlasi
said, as he embraced his wife after hearing the verdict.
   During the six-month trial, Vlasi denied charges that he had
instigated the unrest among ethnic Albanians. He claimed the
proceedings represented a political trial orchestrated by Milosevic.
   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the population of
Kosovo, which borders Albania. The region had enjoyed broad
autonomy, but constitutional changes last year gave Serbia control
of Kosovo's police, judiciary and education.
   At least 60 people have died in violent protests by ethnic
Albanians over the past year.
   The Slav minority, consisting mainly of Serbs and Montenegrins,
contends the changes were necessary to protect them from harassment
by the ethnic Albanians. The Slavs contend the ethnic Albanians are
trying to force them from the region.

   Here are brief sketches of the five
Discovery crew members:
   Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver is making his second trip into
space as commander of Discovery on its mission to deploy the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   Shriver heads a crew of space veterans on the flight. The last
time the National Aeronautics and Space Administration flew a crew
of shuttle veterans was on the first post-Challenger flight, in the
fall of 1988.
   As commander, Shriver is responsible for guiding the shuttle
back to the telescope should a problem occur after it is put in
orbit. Other crew members then would spacewalk to fix the telescope.
   The 45-year-old astronaut first flew into space as pilot of
NASA's first secret shuttle mission for the Pentagon. That January
1985 flight lasted three days.
   The excitement surrounding the long-awaited mission continued to
mount as the launch day neared, Shriver said in a recent interview
at the Johnson Space Center.
   ``This is a major milestone,'' he said.
   ``I think they're (scientists using Hubble) going to make some
discoveries and answer some questions we've got now and probably
raise a lot more than we know about right now.''
   Shriver was born in Jefferson, Iowa, and grew up in Paton, Iowa,
where his parents still live. He graduated from Paton Consolidated
High School.
   He graduated from the Air Force Academy with a bachelor's degree
in aeronautical engineering. He earned a master's degree in

   He attended the Air Force test pilot school at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., and worked on development test and evaluation of the

   Marine Col. Charles F. Bolden Jr., pilot of Discovery, says he
is awed at the prospect of helping deploy a telescope so important
to scientists and the study of the universe.
   ``There's a lot of sentimental attachment to this thing for
me,'' Bolden, a veteran of one previous shuttle mission, said in a
recent interview.
   Bolden noted that although the five Discovery astronauts
actually will put the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit, thousands of
people have worked on the project.
   ``I can't even begin to imagine how good we're going to feel''
when its deployed.
   Bolden, a Vietnam combat veteran, insists he has no unique
skills over other NASA pilots that earned him a seat on the
celebrated flight.
   ``I'm just lucky and thankful to be here,'' Bolden said.
   ``From my standpoint, there's nothing special that I bring other
than my own unique personality, and the ability not to be quite as
serious as you could possibly get on a flight of this magnitude.''
   Bolden, 43, was born in Columbia, S.C., where he graduated from
C.A. Johnson High School.
   He received a bachelor's degree in electrical science from the
U.S. Naval Academy and a master's in systems management from the
University of Southern California. He also is a graduate of the
Navy's test pilot school at Patuxent River, Md.
   While in Southeast Asia, Bolden flew more than 100 missions as
an A-6 attack plane pilot.
   Bolden was selected for astronaut training in 1980. He was a
pilot on his first trip into space _ a January 1986 mission that
was the last shuttle to fly before Challenger exploded shortly
after liftoff.
   He and his wife, Alexis, have two children.

   Mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use Discovery's 50-foot
robot arm to hoist the Hubble Space Telescope out of the cargo bay
and place it in space.
   As an astrophysicist, Hawley has a special interest in the
telescope. He even went to graduate school with some of the
scientists who will use Hubble once it is in orbit.
   ``It's unquestionably a major step,'' the 38-year-old astronaut
said.
   ``It's not unfair, I think, to speculate that the kind of things
the Hubble telescope may see will be revolutionary in terms of what
we know about the universe.''
   ``We know a lot now, we think,'' he said. ``There are some very
important questions, however, that just have been beyond our grasp
because'' scientists have not been able to see distant areas
clearly.
   Hawley, one of three mission specialists on Discovery, also is
the flight engineer _ the crew member who sits on the flight deck
during ascent and landing to assist the commander and pilot.
   Hawley first flew on a seven-day mission in 1984 in which three
satellites were deployed. His current crew member, Charles Bolden,
also was on board Hawley's second mission, a January 1986 flight
that was the last to fly before the Challenger explosion.
   He was born in Ottawa, Kan., and grew up in Salina, Kan., where
he graduated from Salina High School.
   Hawley received a bachelor's degree in physics and astronomy
from the University of Kansas and a doctorate in astronomy and
astrophysics from the University of California.
   Before he was selected for astronaut training in 1978, Hawley
was a postdoctoral research associate in Chile.
   He is married to the former Eileen Keegan.

   Mission Specialist Bruce McCandless II, a Navy captain and an
astronaut since 1966, is one of two crew members who would perform
a spacewalk should a problem occur on the Hubble Space Telescope.
   McCandless' first space flight was a February 1984 mission
aboard Challenger. During that flight, he and crew member Robert L.
Stewart pioneered the use of NASA's manned maneuvering unit _ a
backpack device that allows an astronaut walking in space to propel
himself from the shuttle.
   The 52-year-old astronaut is low key about his spacewalking
experience, saying only that ``it's very nice.''
   ``The biggest problem is you do have limited mobility,'' he said.
   McCandless was born in Boston. He moved to California and
graduated from Woodrow Wilson Senior High School in Long Beach. He
graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, earned a master's degree in
electrical engineering from Stanford University and a master's in
business administration from the University of Houston at Clear
Lake in 1987.
   He was a naval aviator who participated in the Cuban blockade in
the 1962 missile crisis.
   McCandless was selected for astronaut training during the Gemini
program, and he was a backup pilot for the first manned Skylab
mission in 1973.
   McCandless and his wife, Bernice, have two grown children. He is
a member of the National Audubon Society and once was president of
the Houston Audubon Society.

   Mission Specialist Kathryn D. Sullivan is the second crew member
designated to walk in space if necessary during the Discovery
mission.
   Sullivan was the first U.S. woman to perform a spacewalk as she
and fellow crewman David Leetsma demonstrated satellite refueling
techniques in space in 1984. It was her first trip into space.
   The 38-year-old astronaut said she enjoyed her spacewalk, but
she would prefer a problem-free mission to another opportunity to
spacewalk.
   ``I'm there, I'm ready,'' Sullivan said. ``I'm the center
fielder who moves over to cover the right fielder.''
   Sullivan was born in Paterson, N.J. She grew up in Woodland
Hills, Calif., where she graduated from Taft High School. She
earned a bachelor's degree in earth sciences from the University of
California, Santa Cruz, and a doctorate in geology from Dalhousie
University in Halifx, Nova Scotia.
   Before joining NASA in 1978, she concentrated on academic study
and research. Since she came to NASA, her research interests have
included planetary geology.
   In 1985, she became an adjunct professor of geology at Rice
University in Houston.
   Sullivan is a private pilot, rated in powered and glider
aircraft. She is single.

<HEAD>Agency Rejects Proposal to Tax Children's Social Security Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Social Security Administration has
rejected a proposal that it collect income taxes on many Social
Security benefits paid to children claimed as dependents by their
parents.
   The agency rejected the proposal, made by the inspector general
of the Health and Human Services Department, as ``anti-family'' and
contrary to President Bush's goal of a ``kindler, gentler America.''
   Inspector General Richard Kusserow recommended, in an audit
released Tuesday, that the taxes be paid by most of the 334,000
middle- and upper-income families whose children how receive
tax-free benefits.
   Even as the children were receiving the tax-free benefits, about
4.5 million retirees and disabled beneficiaries and their spouses
at the same income levels were paying income taxes on as much as
one-half of their Social Security benefits.
   Kusserow's report was based on a study of benefits and taxes in
1986. He called the present Social Security policy ``inequitable''
and said it will cost the government more than $1 billion in lost
revenues over the next five years.
   Children pay no income tax on their Social Security benefits
unless their income exceeds $25,000 a year.
   In a memo included in the report, Social Security Commissioner
Gwendolyn King rejected the proposal, saying she was concerned
about how it would be perceived by Congress and the public.
   Congress did not intend for children's benefits to be taxable
income to anyone other than the children who receive them, she said.
   Also, she said, taxing the benefits of children claimed as
dependents by parents could be considered anti-family, and taxing
disabled children's benefits ``could appear harsh and contrary to a
`kinder, gentler America.'''

   Jubilant astronomers saw decades of
work take wing Tuesday as the Hubble Space Telescope was boosted
high above Earth to launch ``a great adventure for mankind.''
   Charles Robert O'Dell, a Rice University space physicist who has
worked 19 years on Hubble, said seeing it hurled into orbit aboard
the shuttle capped an experience that was ``comparable to raising a
child. I've been with the program since it was a concept.
   ``There is nothing better than to see 19 years of my work and
five of my friends thrust into orbit,'' he said.
   Colin Norman, a physics and astronomy professor at Johns Hopkins
University and academic affairs director of the Space Telescope
Science Institute there, called the launch ``the perfect start to a
great adventure for mankind.
   ``It was incredibly beautiful. The power of the launch was
awesome and the telescope has an awesome power,'' Norman said.
   Discovery's liftoff was especially gratifying since it ended
seven years of delays. The $1.5 billion telescope originally was
scheduled for launch in 1983 but remained grounded by technical
problems and the Challenger explosion.
   Two weeks ago when hundreds of scientists crowded into the
Kennedy Space Center, the launch was scrubbed four minutes before
liftoff. Only a few dozen of them returned Tuesday, but they were
just as excited.
   ``There were times when we were deeply depressed. There were
times when we were elated'' about Hubble's progress, said William
H. Jeffreys, a University of Texas astronomer and Hubble's
astrometry project leader. Jeffreys said. ``This is one of those
times when we are thrilled beyond belief.''
   Ed Weiler, NASA program scientist for Hubble, said watching the
liftoff was ``a double whammy'' because ``it was my first shuttle
launch and the launch of the HST. It really gets to you.''

   Migrant farm workers face conditions so harsh
that their average lifespan is only 50 years, the chairman of the
House Select Committee on Aging said Tuesday.
   ``It has now been 30 years since Edward R. Murrow's famous
television documentary on American farm workers, `Harvest of
Shame,''' said Rep. Edward R. Roybal, D-Calif. ``Unfortunately,
little has changed in the past 30 years.''
   Witnesses who provide health care and housing for migrant farm
workers in Florida, California and the Southwest said workers are
housed in deplorable conditions, face exposure to dangerous
pesticides and have difficulty getting medical treatment.
   ``Farm workers are old at 40, decrepit at 50,'' said George L.
Ortiz, president of the California Human Development Corp. ``And
only 2 percent collect Social Security payments. They do not live
long enough.''
   The average lifespan for an American is 75 years.
   Roybal said the committee was relying on a 1977 study estimating
3.5 million to 5 million farm workers and dependents live in the
United States. However, he called on the federal government to make
more complete studies of farm workers.

   President Fernando Collor de Mello paid
a surprise visit to a supermarket Tuesday to prove that his
anti-inflationary plan has reduced prices.
   Accompanied by security guards, Collor spent an hour at the
supermarket, armed with a list of staple goods whose prices have
been frozen since the plan took effect March 16.
   Onlookers applauded as Collor put 19 items in his shopping cart,
including chicken, beef, coffee, rice, sugar, and toilet paper. He
paid the equivalent of $28 for the goods and then donated them to a
boy who was begging in front of the store.
   Collor told reporters he had confirmed prices had fallen by 11.5
percent since March 15, when inflation was running at more than 80
percent a month.
   Government officials are predicting zero inflation for April.
   However, two private institutions say the Collor administration
has drastically underestimated inflation.
   The prestigious Getulio Vargas Foundation and the Interunion
Department of Statistics and Socio-Economic Studies say the cost of
living will rise by more than 20 percent this month.

   The mutilated body of a Catholic priest
kidnapped a week ago was found Tuesday near the western town of
Roldanillo, police said.
   The priest, Tiberio Fernandez, was kidnapped Thursday along with
three other people traveling with him in a car near the town of
Trujillo, 185 miles west of Bogota.
   He was in charge of the parish in Trujillo, a town of 23,000
people. Police said the body of the 53-year-old priest was
``totally mutilated.''
   Authorities have neither identified the kidnappers nor
discovered any motive for the crime. Right-wing death squads backed
by drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas are active in the area
of the crime, and both groups have been known to kidnap priests.
   Fernandez's abduction was one of a series near Trujillo in
recent weeks. Unidentified groups have abducted 20 of the town's
residents, and five of the victims, including Fernandez, have been
killed.
   Several Catholic priests have been assassinated in Colombia in
recent years. On Oct. 3, gunmen killed the Catholic bishop for the
eastern state of Arauca, Jesus Emilio Jaramillo. The army blamed
leftist guerrillas of the National Liberation Army.

   Crews today controlled a fire that
burned two train tank cars of crude oil at the site of a derailment
and turned their attention to the threat of an oil and chemical
spill to drinking water.
   ``Everything looks super,'' said Don Grafton, chief of the
Worthington Volunteer Fire Department. ``It looks like we have it
licked.''
   Except for intermittent flames, firefighters had brought the
blaze under control with foam fire retardant, Grafton said.
   The two cars exploded into flames late Monday night and 15
officials and firefighters monitoring the derailment narrowly
escaped injury, authorities said.
   The explosion came a full day after 29 cars of a 97-car Buffalo
&amp; Pittsburgh Railroad freight train plunged into a ravine along
Buffalo Creek.
   The popular fishing creek in this rural community about 45 miles
northeast of Pittsburgh is a tributary of the Allegheny River, the
source of drinking water for several Pittsburgh-area communities.
   About 100,000 gallons of oil leaked from four railcars and up to
10,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide, a caustic chemical used to
clean drains, leaked from one car, said John Bell, the railroad's
general manager. He said some of the oil and a small amount of the
chemical spilled into the creek.
   Booms were set up to skim globs of oil from the water surface.
   Twelve of the derailed cars carried crude oil, said Don Grafton,
chief of the Worthington Volunteer Fire Department.
   In addition to the two brought under control today, he said the
oil burned off from five cars, and one containing more than 26,000
gallons of crude oil had been close enough to be in danger of
exploding, Grafton said.
   Work crews planned to wait until the hot cars cooled before
beginning the tedious task of cleaning up the site, Grafton said.
Firefighters will pump out crude oil left in tanker cars to prevent
more fires and explosions, he said.
   An advisory recommending that elderly residents, young children
and people with respiratory problems stay indoors was lifted
shortly before noon, said Betsy Mallison, spokeswoman for the state
Department of Environmental Resources. The advisory was issued
Monday because of sulfur dioxide emissions from burning coal.
   About 50 people evacuated from their homes may be allowed to
return today if the situation remains stable, Grafton said.
   Firefighters had hoped to avoid an explosion by cooling the tank
cars with water. But they stopped spraying at the request of State
Department of Environmental Resources officials who feared that a
dike built to contain the runoff would overflow.
   Firefighters and officials retreated just before the tankers
burst into flames, Allegheny County Fire Marshal John Kaus said.
   ``We just started to come off the hillside, and we heard a loud
hissing and then a rumble ...,'' Kaus said. The tankers exploded
moments apart, he said.
   ``The only thing we saw _ in front of us, in back of us, on top
of us _ was fire. ... I never want to go through it again. The only
thing I could attribute it to was like walking through hell,'' Kaus
said. ``If it had happened five to 10 minutes earlier, we would
have lost 15 to 20 men.''
   Two carloads of smoldering coal were moved to a field about 150
yards from the track, Bell said. The coal was spread on the ground
and sprayed with water to cool it.
   About 200 people had been evacuated late Sunday, but most were
allowed to return home Monday.

<TEXT>
   A man has been charged with setting fire to
two Greyhound Lines buses, but investigators say he was not
employed by the strike-bound carrier that has been plagued by
violence.
   Shots have damaged 36 buses and three terminals since
Greyhound's 6,300 drivers and 3,000 maintenance and office workers
walked out over wages and job security at America's only nationwide
bus system, the company says.
   Clifton Wayne Kendrick, 28, was arrested late Monday in
connection with the weekend bus fires and another blaze at a
residence, police said.
   He was a drifter with no association with the strike-bound
carrier, fire department investigator Alfredo Castro Jr. said.
   Several striking workers outside the San Antonio bus terminal
Sunday had said they believed transients started the blazes.
   The bus fires, reported late Saturday, were started by emergency
flares taken from a compartment on one of the vehicles, officials
said.
   The fires burned out before destroying the buses because of a
lack of oxygen, said fire Capt. Dan Davila.
   Damage was estimated at $40,000.
   It was the second bus arson attack since the strike began March
2, authorities said. Flares were used similarly in Boston about two
weeks ago to set two buses afire, Greyhound spokesman George
Gravley said.

^Refugees Said to Top 15 Million World-Wide

<TEXT>
   There were more than 15 million refugees last
year despite the easing of international tension, the U.S.
Committee for Refugees said Tuesday.
   ``The number of refugees worldwide has increased by 50 percent
in the last five years _ from 10 million in 1985 to 15 million in
1989,'' Robert P. Winter, director of the private group, said in a
statement.
   ``That does not take into account at least that many more
persons who have fled their homes for the same reasons as refugees,
but who remain within the boundaries of their countries.''
   The committee had estimated the total number of refugees at 14.4
million the previous year.
   The opening of the border between East Germany and West Germany
brought a large westward flow at the end of 1989. However, the
committee said its numbers didn't include 720,000 ethnic Germans
who went to West Germany from Eastern Europe, three times as many
as the year before.
   The committee says its annual report contains the most
comprehensive statistics available.
   Precise figures cannot be obtained in many remote areas,
however. The number of refugees in Sudan are estimated at from 2
million to 3.2 million.
   Most of the 1989 increase came in Africa.
   Malawi, one of the world's poorest countries, shelters 812,000
refugees from Mozambique, which is even poorer. The refugees have
fled civil war in Mozambique and their numbers were increasing as
1989 ended.
   Another 80,000 fled civil war in Sudan and 40,000 left Angola
for Namibia. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced within Burma
during 40 years of civil war, the committee said.
   More than a million refugees come from each of four areas:
Afghanistan, Mozambique, Ethiopia and Israel.
   Despite the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the biggest
single source of refugees, the report said 5.9 million Afghans
remained outside their homeland. Most are in Pakistan and Iran.
   Between 1975 and 1988 the United States accepted the largest
number of refugees: 1,249,608, or one for every 199 Americans.
   Canada was second, with 252,225, but the proportion was larger _
one for every 104 Canadians. Sweden, Australia and Denmark also
took proportionally larger numbers than the United States.

   Norman Cousins, who in 1957 founded the U.S.
National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy, received the Niwano
Peace Prize from a Buddhist group Tuesday for his work on behalf of
nuclear disarmament.
   The Niwano Peace Foundation awards the $126,000 prize each year
to an individual or group deemed to have made an outstanding
contribution to world peace through inter-religious cooperation.
   ``Cousins devoted himself to the nuclear disarmament movement
almost since the inception of nuclear weapons, campaigning
tirelessly for the reduction of nuclear arsenals both in the United
States and elsewhere,'' the foundation said.
   In 1949, Cousins established a foster care program for 400
children orphaned by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. He also
arranged for people badly burned in the bombing to receive medical
treatment in the United States.
   An estimated 140,000 people were killed in the U.S. atomic
attack on the city in the closing days of World War II.
   ``His combination of theory and practice have won him worldwide
respect as a humanist impelled by love and compassion for
humanity,'' the foundation said.
   The foundation was established in 1978 by Rissho Kosei-Kai, a
Japanese lay Buddhist organization.
   Cousins was editor of the U.S. magazine Saturday Review for 35
years until his retirement in 1977. Since then, he has taught at
the University of California, Los Angeles. He is also president of
the World Federalists' Association of the United States.
   ``It has not been easy, I recognize, for Japan to resist both
national and external pressures to join the arms race of the
superpowers,'' Cousins said in an acceptance speech.
   Cousins was selected from among 728 nominees from 121 nations.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   DEATH APPEAL
   
   The court, ruling in the case of an Arkansas mass murderer,
allowed states to execute convicted murderers even if no appeals
court reviews the validity of their convictions or death sentences.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices threw out an appeal filed for _ but
not by _ R. Gene Simmons, sentenced to death for killing 16
relatives and acquaintances in 1987.
   The court said such an appeal cannot be filed by a fellow death
row inmate.
   The case is Whitmore vs. Arkansas, 88-7146.
   
   REAR WINDOW
   
   The court said, in a ruling that could affect millions of
dollars in movie industry profits, that distributors of the Alfred
Hitchcock thriller ``Rear Window'' must share with a literary agent
earnings from the film's re-release.
   The 6-3 ruling was a defeat for actor Jimmy Stewart and
Hitchcock's heirs. Some film producers claimed it could limit
availability of movie classics.
   The case is Stewart vs. Abend, 88-2102.
   
   GUAM
   
   The court ruled that the U.S. territory of Guam and its
officials may not be sued for allegedly violating a much-used
federal civil rights law.
   The justices, by a 6-2 vote, threw out part of a lawsuit filed
by six Guam residents who said police punched, kicked and
threatened them to get them to confess to drug-related crime.
   The law allows those who prove government actions or policies
violated their constitutional rights to collect monetary damages.
   The case is Ngiraingas vs. Sanchez, 88-1281.

recession. On the other hand, it's not a boom either.''
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods _ items
expected to last more than three years _ jumped 6.7 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $128.8 billion. It was the largest increase
since a 7.4 percent gain in December 1988.
   However, analysts noted that most of the growth was consigned to
the aircraft industry. Excluding the transportation category,
orders rose 2 percent.
   ``It's not nearly as good as the 6.7 percent would suggest
because most of it was just a turnaround in aircraft orders,''
Evans said.
   Aircraft orders had declined for two consecutive months.
   ``I'm not going to denegrate this number,'' said Robert G.
Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
``But at the same time ... you're talking about a durable goods
sector that's still in the same sort of sideways drift that it's
been in for a number of months.''
   Economist Thomas Runiewicz of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., noted that orders rose in all categories _ ``a sign that
economic growth will be more positive for the remainder of 1990.''
   ``This definitely supports that we are coming out of the
economic slowdown,'' Runiewicz said.
   Another bright spot in the March report was a 14.9 percent jump,
to $41.4 billion, in the closely watched non-defense capital goods
orders. That sector often is a leading indicator of future business
investment plans.
   The March report was the second monthly rebound from January's
record 10.5 percent decline brought about by sharp drops in
aircraft and automobile orders.
   Aircraft orders continued to fall in February, but a resumption
in automobile orders helped push overall orders up 2.3 percent.
However, that was weaker than the 3.3 percent gain originally
reported last month.
   But transportation orders advanced 21 percent in March, mostly
because of aircraft orders although demand for automobiles also
rose significantly, the Commerce Department said. It was the
largest transportation gain since a 22.1 percent increase in
December 1988.
   Smaller increases were posted elsewhere: primary metals, up 7
percent to $11.7 billion; non-electrical machinery, up 1.6 percent
to $22.7 billion; and electrical machinery, up 1.1 percent to $20.1
billion.
   The often-volatile defense orders fell 4.5 percent, to $7.3
billion, after rising 18.4 percent in February.
   Excluding defense, however, orders rose 7.5 percent, the largest
increase since an 8.3 percent jump in September 1980.
   Shipments of durable goods were up 1.5 percent to $125 billion,
while unfilled orders rose 0.8 percent to $496.7 billion.

   A man in a business suit opened fire today in the
food court of a suburban shopping mall, killing one man and
wounding at least three other people, authorities said.
   James Calvin Brady, 32, of Atlanta was charged with one count of
murder and three counts of aggravated assault, DeKalb County Public
Safety Director Thomas Brown said.
   As officers led Brady away he muttered, ``You don't know what
all these people have done to me,'' Brown said.
   He said police had not established a motive for the attack.
   ``We don't believe it was directed toward the individuals who
were shot; we think it was directed toward people in general,''
Brown said.
   Todd Smith, assistant manager of a deli at Perimeter Mall, said
he looked up when he thought he heard a balloon pop about 11:30
a.m. and saw a man in a suit firing off about four rounds.
   ``It appears to be random,'' he said, adding that the diners in
the area panicked. ``Everybody just ... dispersed. He threw the gun
in the trash can and then he walked off.''
   One man, wounded in the chest, was taken to Northside Hospital,
where he died about 1{ hours after the shooting, hospital
spokeswoman Carol King said. His identity was not released.
   Three more victims _ two women and a man _ were taken to
Shallowford Hospital. Hospital spokeswoman Cathy McAfee said the
man, in his 20s, suffered a leg wound that was not life-threatening
and was listed in stable but critical condition.
   The two women were in stable condition. One, in her 50s, had a
pelvic wound and the other, in her 70s, suffered an abdominal
wound, she said.
   There was some confusion over the number of people shot. Police
at first said four, then five, but hospital officials said only
four people were taken to the two hospitals.
   The food court was not crowded, said Willie Edwards, a delivery
driver for a men's store in the mall. ``This was like pre-lunch
hour; it really hadn't got as crowded as it could have been,'' he
said.
   Mary Jo Cullinan, manager of Brentanos bookstore, said she and
four customers heard the gunfire.
   ``I suddenly heard six shots fired,'' she said. ``We ran into
the back of the store. We came out when we couldn't hear anything.
Two of the customers asked to leave out the back door because they
didn't want to go back out into the mall, understandably.''

   Democrats have decided against nominating
anyone to oppose Republican Sen. John W. Warner. The decision
blocks a Democratic bid by a Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. supporter, the
state Democratic chairman said Tuesday.
   The party chairman, Paul Goldman, said he had reports on about
1,500 of the 1,800 delegates elected at mass meetings around the
state Saturday and Monday.
   ``About 90 percent of the people have been elected for no
candidate,'' Goldman said. Slightly less than 10 percent were
uncommitted and four delegates supported former U.S. Rep. Joseph
Fisher, who has not decided whether to run.
   Nancy Spannaus, a follower of LaRouche, received no support for
her bid for the Democratic nomination, Goldman said.
   ``This is an unprecedented repudiation of political extremism,''
he said. ``I'm really proud of the Democratic Party all across the
state.''
   To block Mrs. Spannaus' candidacy, the Democratic state central
committee agreed that the party convention would be canceled if
more than 50 percent of the Democrats attending the mass meetings
did not want a candidate.
   The committee still could select a nominee by a two-thirds vote
before the June 12 filing deadline.
   ``I don't know what will happen,'' Goldman said. ``Maybe a
candidate will come forward, maybe one won't.''
   He declined to say whether the committee would support Fisher.
``I'm not going to prejudge anything,'' Goldman said.
   Mrs. Spannaus has said she may run as an independent.
   She has described herself as a Democrat, but Goldman said he did
not think she would confuse voters.
   With Warner, 63, well-financed and heavily favored for
re-election to a third term, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder said in January
he would rather his fellow Democrats nominate no one than a weak
candidate.
   Bu Goldman said Democrats would continue to criticize Warner's
record in Washington.
   ``We still have a case to be made against Warner,'' he said.
``We're just looking for somebody to make the case.''

<TEXT>
   A lawyer who won acquittal for a defendant in
the 1976 assassination of former Chilean ambassador Orlando
Letelier said Tuesday he wants to represent another man charged in
the killing.
   New York attorney Paul Goldberger appeared in U.S. District
Court with Jose Dionisio Suarez Esquivel, a Cuban exile arrested
April 11 in the car bombing that killed Letelier.
   Suarez had been a fugitive since his 1978 indictment. Ed Sussman
was appointed by the court to represent Suarez, who was arrested in
St. Peterburg, Fla.
   Suarez's family and friends will decide whether to retain
Goldberger, who earlier represented Guillermo Novo Sampol. Novo,
indicted for conspiracy, killing a foreign official and five other
charges, was acquitted in the Letelier case eight years ago.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Marcy said Goldberger's entry into
the case would present a serious conflict of interest because Novo
is a potential government witness against Suarez.
   Goldberger said he doubted prosecutors would call Novo, who he
said did not intend to cooperate with the government. Raising the
conflict issue ``might be a way to get us out of the case,''
Goldberger said in a brief interview outside the courtroom.
   U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson said he would address
the question of conflict of interest if Goldberger is hired.
   Suarez is accused of murdering a foreign official and four other
charges in the death of Letelier, Chile's ambassador to Washington
from 1970 to 1973 under the Marxist government of Salvador Allende.
   Also indicted were the two top officials in Chile's intelligence
service during the military rule of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The
Chilean courts have refused to extradite the two former officials.

   President Bush said today he will not impose
sanctions on the Soviet Union in response to the Kremlin's
crackdown in Lithuania, saying such steps at this time could
backfire.
   ``I'm concerned that we not inadvertently do something that
compels the Soviet Union to take action that would set back the
whole case of freedom around the world,'' Bush said after a meeting
with congressional leaders.
   Bush told a group of agricultural writers that while he was not
ready to announce penalties at this time against the Soviet Union,
``If there were anything done, it would ... be on the economic
side.''
   Bush also said he would not consider imposing a grain embargo on
the Soviet Union in response to its actions in Lithuania.
   Administration officials said Bush, who appeared a day ago to be
on the brink of imposing economic penalties, decided to wait after
reports from Moscow that U.S. sanctions could wind up making the
situation worse in Lithuania.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush
decided to hold off on any sanctions at this time after
consultations with leaders of ``at least 20 countries.''
   There was a ``confluence of voices,'' particularly from allies
in Western Europe, against strong U.S. steps against Moscow,
Fitzwater said.
   He cited concerns of Soviet countermoves, not only against
Lithuania and other Baltic states, but in Poland and other fragile
new Eastern European democracies.
   Still, Fitzwater said, Bush still retains the right to impose
economic sanctions to protest Soviet tactics in Lithuania _ and
might do so at any time.
   ``I'm not going to give up trying to get the Soviet Union and
the Lithuanians into a dialogue,'' Bush said.
   ``I would encourage the Soviet Union and the Lithuanians to go
forward right now with dialogue,'' he said. ``Let's hope they can
start talking. This results in a great deal of potential for the
freedom that we seek for the Lithuanians.''
   ``Therein lies the answer,'' Bush said.
   ``I will let the American people know, and the Congress know,
when I decide to take certain action. And the decision has not been
made,'' he added.
   Administration officials had said earlier that Bush was near a
decision on a package of economic penalties. But participants at
today's congressional meeting said the president voiced repeated
concerns over Soviet retaliation against Lithuania should the
United States step up its pressure on Moscow.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I, said Bush told congressional leaders
he was not prepared to announce sanctions at this time because
``the action could precipitate an escalation. We don't want to see
that happen.''
   Pell, speaking to reporters on the White House driveway after
the hour-long session, said that there emerged from the session ``a
general feeling of support for the president.''
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, suggested one factor in Bush's hesitancy to act
could be because that U.S. allies in Western Europe ``are not
willing to consider stiff economic sanctions.''
   Fascell said he told Bush that a better response would be to
postpone the May 30-June 3 superpower summit. ``That would send a
message all around the world,'' Fascell said. He said the president
did not respond to the suggestion.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., gave Bush a vote of
confidence following the White House meeting.
   ``I think the president is proceeding carefully, and think that
is the appropriate course,'' Foley told reporters. ``I am not at
all critical of the president. I think he's approaching it
appropriately.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said that Bush indicated he wanted
to ``consult with members of Congress'' on the situation and added,
``I don't think any decisions were arrived at.''
   Bentsen called the crisis in Lithuania a situation ``where a
great deal of discretion'' would be given to the president.
   A report from Moscow quoting Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Vadim P. Perfiliev suggesting that U.S. sanctions could wind up
backfiring and hurting Lithuania may have been a factor in Bush's
decision, an administration official said.
   The measures under consideration included delaying or
withholding a variety of planned trade, investment and other
economic concessions that the United States had been prepared to
grant the Soviet Union, said officials, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
   The would, in effect, put a hold on U.S.-Soviet trade
liberalization talks, which were scheduled to get under way today
in Paris.
   The Kremlin says sanctions could hurt both Lithuania and the
overall international situation.
   Perfiliev said that Moscow's dispute with Lithuania was ``a
problem which is purely an internal affair, and any actions which
could pull the sides in the argument even further apart could have
negative consequences, not only for the Soviet Union but for the
international situation.''

   Seven years late, the Hubble Space
Telescope is where it belongs, out of this world and in search of
others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning
of time.
   Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle
Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its first
test radio signal. At the sign of life, applause and cheers erupted
in Mission Control in Houston.
   ``As near as we can tell, everything looks perfect,'' said
astronaut Steve Hawley from the shuttle. Hawley's job on Wednesday
will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15-year stay in space.
   Discovery, trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue
sky, carried the silver-colored telescope to an orbit 380 miles
above Earth _ higher by 70 miles than any previous shuttle. There
the Hubble will stay to search for yet-unseen wonders of creation
with instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time.
   ``Our window on the universe!'' NASA launch commentator George
Diller exulted as the Discovery rose off its seaside launch pad.
   ``It's a beautiful day to have Hubble Space Telescope in orbit
instead of here on Earth like it's been for so many years,'' said
NASA administrator Richard Truly. ``Hubble's in its element and I'm
delighted.''
   The telescope was supposed to be launched in 1983, but technical
problems and the Challenger accident delayed its deployment. It
suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was
stopped at the four-minutes-to-go point because of a faulty
hydraulic unit on the shuttle.
   While it remained on Earth, the telescope cost $7 million a
month to exercise and keep in readiness. In its first day in space,
that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the
Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
   On hand to watch the Discovery launching was a contingent of
scientists who have hailed the Hubble as the greatest advance in
astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly
400 years ago.
   Truly referred to the early-day astronomer when he was asked
about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working
station.
   ``Somebody the other day said, `Who remembers the day that
Galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars?''' said
Truly, a former shuttle astronaut. ``It doesn't matter what day we
launch Hubble, it matters that we do it right.''
   The telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter, about the
size of a railroad tank car. When it flies free, it will receive
electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two
wing-like solar arrays that extend outward on each side.
   It is named after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who
theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away
a galaxy is, the faster it is traveling. That gave support to the
theory that a massive explosion _ the Big Bang _ created the
universe 10 to 20 billion years ago.
   The Hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major
questions: How old is the universe? How big is it?
   The telescope has two mirrors, one 94.5 inches in diameter, the
other 12 inches. Two of the instruments are cameras, two are
spectrometers and one is a photometer. In addition, the fine
pointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precise
measurement of distances.
   On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12{-ton telescope with
the shuttle's mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point
it, and _ after a long checkout _ drop it overboard to orbit on its
own.
   In the cargo bay, the telescope receives electrical power from
the shuttle. But the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out
and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels are
extended to receive light from the sun.
   Should the solar panels not deploy, mission specialists Bruce
McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be standing by, partially
dressed in space suits, ready to go into the open cargo bay to
unfurl the arrays manually.
   Discovery's launch was not without its problems.
   With 31 seconds left in the countdown, the computer that runs
the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and
stopped the launch process. The problem was overcome and the
shuttle lifted off at 8:34 a.m. EDT, about three minutes late.
   The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at 9:49 a.m. EDT at
Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   ``On the way uphill,'' as Commander Loren J. Shriver put it, the
shuttle's windshield was splattered with ``several flecks of
things.'' He said the windshield was streaked by the debris and
that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off
during the climb to orbit.
   The astronauts also had problems with their UHF radio circuit,
and one of the ship's small rear thrusters was inoperative. Neither
problem was considered serious.

   Bowing to weeks of pressure, President
Mobutu Sese Seko said Tuesday he had lifted a 20-year ban on
opposition parties and would let a multiparty government replace
his in a year.
   Thousands of Zaireans chanting, singing and waving branches
poured into downtown Kinshasa, the capital, and blocked the streets
to cheer the president's decision.
   Mobutu, absolute ruler since taking power Nov. 24, 1965,
announced in a nationally broadcast speech that he was setting up a
transitional government to rule until free elections could be held.
No election date was set.
   ``I am taking leave of the Popular Movement for the Revolution
(MPR),'' said Mobutu, 59. He said he would no longer be head of the
party that supplanted the government in 1970, but would remain as
president ``at the request of the people of Zaire.''
   Mobutu said three parties will be allowed at first. His Popular
Movement for the Revolution, which under Zaire's law was the
country's government, no longer will hold any special status, he
said.
   Mobutu said one leading opposition figure, Etienne Tshisekedi,
was released from detention Tuesday and his Union for Democracy and
Social Progess party legalized. He did not say which of several
other opposition groups, whose leaders are in exile, would be
selected as the third legal party.
   He said the constitution will be rewritten and a transitional
government established until elections are held. The elections will
produce a new government by April 24, 1991, he said.
   In recent weeks, Mobutu had been battered by a wave of
unprecedented criticism.
   He began a tour of the nation in January, seeking public comment
on his rule. Thousands of replies were sent in from business
groups, churches, unions, students and individuals. Many bitterly
critized the government and Mobutu himself, accusing the president
and his cronies of corruption and monopolizing power.
   The country's Roman Catholic bishops compared Mobutu's rule to a
monarchy.
   Mobutu did not reply directly to the criticisms but promised
``the will of the majority will be respected. We will proceed
together on the changes wanted by the majority.''
   The former journalist and army sergeant has ruled the former
Belgian Congo since Nov. 24, 1965. He renamed the country and ran
it almost as a personal fiefdom.
   Like most African presidents, Mobutu has asserted one-party rule
was the only way to avoid tribalism. In the country's first five
years of independence, more than 100,000 people died in fighting
attributed to ethnic or regional conflicts.
   Since 1970, every citizen of Zaire has been automatically
registered as a member of the official party. Opposition groups
were brutally repressed, and Mobutu claimed 99.99 percent of the
vote in presidential elections.
   He renamed the country Zaire and ordered Zaireans to replace
their Christian names with African names. Men were required to
replace Western-style suits and neckties with high-necked jackets.
   As part of Mobutu's campaign to replace European influences, he
ordered that people address each other as ``citizen,'' rather than
``sir'' or ``madame.''
   Mobutu himself changed his name from Joseph Desire Mobutu to
Mobutu Sese Seko, translated as ``the all powerful warrior who ...
''
   Perhaps most symbolic about Mobutu's announcement Tuesday was
his declaration that Western-style suits would no longer be banned,
and people could again call each other ``sir'' or ``madame.''
   After taking power, Mobutu nationalized key industries,
including copper production, and replaced expatriate advisers and
experts with Zaireans.
   Production collapsed, along with much of country's
infrastructure. Mobutu was accused of using his plan to plunder the
country's wealth. His critics say he amassed several billion
dollars.
   Twice he needed major Western military intervention to put down
revolts, and international organizations and opposition leaders
said he brutally repressed any opposition.
   But the United States and other Western governments supported
Mobutu, who was committed to opposing the expansion of Marxism in
the region. Zaire has been a conduit of U.S. aid to anti-Marxist
guerrillas in Angola, Zaire's southern neighbor.
   Critics of Mobutu in the U.S. Congress say the radical decline
in East-West tensions has made cultivation of Mobutu unnecessary.

   Later this week, a command radioed
from Earth will open the lens cap on the Hubble Space Telescope and
allow the first light from space to strike its mirror.
   If telescopes have a most-important moment, that will be it. It
will mean that Hubble, flying free 380 miles above the world, has
opened its eyes to the heavens and is ready to make discoveries not
yet imagined.
   NASA is so concerned about that lens cap opening, it is keeping
the shuttle Discovery in the neighborhood just in case. Astronauts
Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan will be suited up, ready to
walk in space to open the cap _ formally called an aperture door _
by hand.
   Opening that door is step 65 in a sequence NASA laid out to
activate and check out the $1.5 billion telescope and its five
instruments before the shuttle pulls away and leaves the Hubble to
its own devices.
   The instruments themselves, mounted behind the telescope's 94.5
inch mirror, were warmed up Tuesday, soon after the shuttle lifted
into a sunny Florida sky. Their ability to communicate with the
ground was checked one-by-one.
   One of the instruments, the Wide-Field and Planetary Camera,
operates in two modes as its name implies. In the wide-field mode,
the camera can photograph a giant galaxy 60 million light years
from Earth. How far is that? Light travels 5,900,000,000,000 miles
in one year.
   With this instrument, astronomers plan to look into crowded
centers of galaxies and search for disk-shaped formations of gas
and dust around young stars where new planetary systems may be
forming. If they discover a star like our sun and planets like our
Earth, they may be on the trail of other life in the universe.
   In its planetary mode, the camera can photograph entire
hemispheres of any planet in our solar system in a single exposure.
Scientists will be able to take photographs of Neptune as sharp and
detailed as those taken by the two Voyager spacecraft when each was
only five days away.
   A second instrument is the Faint-Object Camera, provided by the
European Space Agency. It is designed to detect distant objects and
extends the reach of the telescope to the greatest possible
distance.
   This camera will photograph stars seven times farther away than
any before it. ``Many stars and galaxies that are considered faint
by present standards will be almost blazing light sources to the
Faint-Object Camera,'' says a NASA brochure.
   A third instrument, the Faint-Object Spectrograph, will analyze
the light from individual stars and nebulae in our galaxy and those
nearby and provide data to deduce their physical and chemical
properties. It will investigate more distant galaxies and study
light from quasars and whole galaxies.
   The spectrograph also will be used to study erupting stars _
supernova _ and determine the rate at which the expansion of the
universe has been slowing over billions of years.
   Its conclusions will help settle a scientific argument over
nothing less than the likely fate of the universe: If the
deceleration rate is small, then the universe will continue to
expand forever. If it is as fast as some scientists maintain, then
the expansion will come to a halt eventually and the universe will
begin to contract.
   A fourth instrument, the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph,
sees only ultraviolet light to examine physical and chemical
conditions in objects it looks at. It will be able to observe trace
substances in interstellar space that can't be detected any other
way. When the telescope is tracking a bright comet, the
spectrograph will search for evidence that comets were formed from
interstellar matter. And it will measure temperatures of explosion
in the upper atmospheres of red dwarf stars.
   The simplest instrument on the Hubble, containing no moving
parts, is the High-Speed Photometer, a light meter that measures
the intensity, wavelength and other properties of light. It will
measure the structure and ongoing physical processes in interacting
binary stars _ including those that may contain black holes.
   With this instrument, astronomers will study many of the exotic
phenomena in the ring systems of Saturn, Jupiter and Uranus and
also will determine the diameters of stars.
   There is, effectively, a sixth instrument on the Hubble _ fine
guidance sensors that point the telescope with precision. From
Washington, claim scientists, the sensors could spot a dime in the
window of the World Trade Center in Manhattan _ and hold it steady
in sight for 24 hours.

<HEAD>German Leaders Set July 2 as Date for Economic, Social Unification</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere on Tuesday named July 2 as the
day for economic and social union of the two Germanys, a West
German spokesman said.
   Union in those areas will bring the divided nation a long way
toward full unification after more than four decades of separation
following the horror of the Nazi dictatorship and defeat in World
War II.
   The issue of political union, or holding an election to form a
single government, remains to be worked out.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, joined by their colleagues from
Britain, France and the two German states, are scheduled to meet in
Bonn on May 5.
   There, they will try to resolve difficult international aspects
of unification, including Germany's future military stance.
   While early July has frequently been mentioned as a goal for
economic, monetary and social union _ meaning the coordination of
social benefits, such as unemployment and old age pensions _
Tuesday's statement was the first confirmation of a specific target
date.
   Delegations from both Germanys are to meet in East Berlin on
Wednesday to negotiate over how to best introduce the powerhouse
West German mark into East Germany's battered economy.
   The basis of the talks will be Bonn's proposal for monetary
union, which calls for a basic 1-1 exchange rate of East German
marks for West marks for wages, salaries and pensions in East
Germany.
   The announcements, made by West German government spokesman
Dieter Vogel, followed three hours of private talks between Kohl
and de Maiziere. De Maiziere was visiting Bonn for the first time
as East Germany's prime minister.
   Vogel said Kohl and de Maiziere spoke in a friendly atmosphere.
   De Maiziere, talking to reporters after the meeting, was asked
whether he had accepted the West German government's latest
proposal for monetary union.
   ``There was nothing for me to accept. The chancellor presented
the government's suggestions, and we'll negotiate about them,'' de
Maiziere said.
   He said hammering out a monetary union would require ``many
talks and negotiations.''
   The West German monetary union proposal, announced Monday,
represented a surprising concession to East German demands. East
Germans had feared that the exchange rate would be one West German
mark for two East German marks _ a rate that was initially proposed
by West Germany's central bank.
   The 1-1 rate will be limited, however, in the case of savings to
$2,300 per person. This angered East Germans.
   Initial steps also were taken Tuesday toward a political union
between the two countries. Kohl assigned a working group to put
together a proposal for conducting the first all-German elections,
government spokesman Hans Klein announced.
   The group will include representatives from all parties in the
coalition _ the conservative Christian Democratic Union, the
Christian Social Union and the centrist Free Democrat Party.
   Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union favors holding
the first all-German elections at the end of 1991, after West
Germany's national elections in December 1990.
   The Free Democrats, however, want an all-German election in
early 1991, skipping the West German national elections this year.
   In another development, East German Foreign Minister Markus
Meckel arrived in Bonn for a meeting with his West German
counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   The talks focused on the merging of Germany within the framework
of a united Europe and the so-called ``two plus four'' talks on May
5 between the two Germanys, the United States, the Soviet Union,
Britain and France.
   One of the main stumbling blocks is the military status of a
united Germany. The United States has insisted that Germany be a
member of NATO, while the Soviets have demanded that a united
Germany be neutral.

   A preliminary investigation indicates
arson caused the fire that killed the wife of a Solidarity
journalist who investigated the secret police, a prosecutor told
Polish television.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki established a commission to
monitor the investigation into the fire that broke out Sunday in
the suburban Warsaw apartment of Jerzy Jachowicz, an editor at the
daily Gazeta Wyborcza, and his wife, Maria.
   Mrs. Jachowicz, 49, died after awaking to find the hallway in
flames and jumping from a third-floor window, authorities said.
   Jachowicz escaped serious injury. The couple's 14-year-old
daughter was hospitalized after jumping with her mother.
   Deputy General Prosecutor Aleksander Herzog told state
television Monday that investigators have concluded ``with a
probability close to certainty that the cause of the fire was
criminal arson.''
   He said the fire appeared to have been started by a petroleum
product.
   On the prime minister's commission with Herzog are top officials
of the interior and justice ministries.
   Jachowicz has written numerous articles about the Interior
Ministry, long used by the Communist authorities to repress dissent
in Poland and widely distrusted.
   Steps have been taken by the Solidarity government to make the
ministry adjust to post-Communist Poland. Earlier this month, the
parliament voted to restructure the ministry and disband the secret
police.
   The Interior Ministry is still headed by Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak,
a former Communist who was retained by the new government.

<HEAD>NATO Commander Predicts Nuclear Talks Could Begin `Sooner Than
Later'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO's top military commander said
Tuesday negotiations to reduce tactical nuclear arms in Europe
could begin soon after the expected signing this year of an accord
slashing tanks, troops and other non-nuclear forces.
   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, the supreme allied commander in Europe,
also indicated he still supports a new generation of short-range
nuclear missiles, but he acknowledged the difficulty in deploying
them in Europe.
   ``In my opinion, there is not unanimous political acceptance at
this time of the (missile) in Europe,'' Galvin said in an interview
at the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   With declining East-West tensions, the Bush administration said
last week it was postponing development of the weapon, a more
powerful version of the aging Lance surface-to-surface missile.
   The weapon has become increasingly unpopular in West Germany,
where most of the missiles would be based.
   Galvin said he believes the new weapon ``would be an excellent
way to support the mission of nuclear deterrence and nuclear
defense.''
   ``But I would have to say, in all objectivity, that one weapon
doesn't make or break an alliance,'' he said. ``If the question is,
can I carry out my mission without the follow-on-to-Lance, the
answer is yes.''
   The Lance was introduced in 1972, and military analysts have
said it will become obsolete in 1995. Its maximum range is about 75
miles.
   Its replacement would be designed to hit a target more than 250
miles away, just under the limits of the 1987 Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty.
   Galvin predicted that East-West negotiations to pare battlefield
nuclear weapons in Europe ``would begin sooner rather than later.''
   President Bush and other NATO leaders agreed last spring that
bargaining on nuclear arms would not occur until implementation had
begun of a treaty on reducing tanks, artillery, troops and other
conventional forces in Europe.
   ``The question becomes what does implementation actually mean
... That probably leaves room for some negotiating as to when it
would begin,'' Galvin said.
   He predicted that bargaining ``could begin very soon after they
signed a (conventional arms) treaty.''
   Negotiators for the 16 NATO nations and the seven Warsaw Pact
countries are pressing at talks in Vienna to try to wrap up a
conventional arms accord by the end of the year, possibly in the
fall.
   Galvin ruled out a further reduction in the number of Soviet and
American troops stationed in Europe in the current round of Vienna
talks.
   Moscow and Washington have agreed to equal ceilings of 195,000
soldiers stationed outside their national territory in Central
Europe. The United States would maintain an additional 30,000
soldiers outside that zone, in Britain and southern Europe.
   ``There is no other program,'' Galvin said. ``It doesn't mean
that I don't think that sometime in the future we might be in a
different situation, but right now 195,000 is it.''
   He also said he doubted that France would return to NATO's
integrated military command despite recent calls from Britain for
it to become a full participant in the alliance.
   ``France has said with great definition that it will not rejoin
the military structure,'' Galvin said.
   France pulled out of the joint military command in 1966,
although it still remains a member of the organization.

   Former Mayor Andrew Young formally entered the
Democratic gubernatorial race today, calling his campaign to become
the nation's second black elected governor the ``beginning of a new
day'' in Georgia.
   Young, the fifth Democrat to qualify for the ballot, brought a
large entourage of well-wishers to the statehouse for the occasion.
   Young paid homage to Georgia's powerful House speaker, Tom
Murphy. He said he looks forward to working with Murphy, who
supports rival Democratic candidate Lauren ``Bubba'' McDonald,
because ``I think I know where we need to go ... he (Murphy) knows
how to get there.''
   Young is viewed as a front-runner, but likely to be forced into
a runoff with Lt. Gov. Zell Miller.
   ``If it were held today, that's what we would have,'' Young
said. ``But I'm just getting started. And I'm going to use these
next three months. I don't run to come in second and I don't run
for ties. I run to win.''
   Other Democrats who have qualified for the race are state Sen.
Roy Barnes and former Gov. Lester Maddox. State Rep. Johnny Isakson
is generally considered the Republican front-runner.

   City officials say Scooter, a
one-winged Rhode Island Red, can return home, where the chicken
sleeps in its owner's waterbed. However, the fight for the hen's
house rights isn't over.
   Pembroke Pines' Code Enforcement Board voted 4-1 on Monday that
Scooter is a pet, not a farm animal. City codes prohibit the latter
in residential areas.
   Candy Weichbrodt, 42, has been separated from Scooter since
April 11 to avoid a possible $250-a-day fine.
   ``She hasn't eaten and hasn't laid any eggs since I took her to
my mother's in Ocala, and I'm afraid she may pine herself to
death,'' said Weichbrodt, an animal rights crusader whose other
house pets include rabbits, cats, love birds, dogs and a
4-foot-long iguana named Merlin.
   Several people had complained to city officials about the
chicken, but no one showed up to testify against Scooter.
   Weichbrodt is building a fence in her back yard in anticipation
of bringing Scooter home.
   But Weichbrodt, who lives in a Broward County development, has
been notified by her homeowner association that its rules prohibit
fowl.
   ``Now I'm going to fight my homeowner association,'' she said.

<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albert Salmi, who made a career out of
portraying cowboys in television Westerns such as ``Gunsmoke,'' and
his wife were found shot to death in an apparent murder-suicide,
police said today.
   Salmi, 62, apparently shot his 55-year-old wife, Roberta G.
Salmi, and then killed himself, said police spokesman Lt. Robert
Van Leuven.
   A friend who had gone to check on Mrs. Salmi on Monday night
peered through a window and saw her legs, said Lt. Jim Hill.
Officers forced their way into the home and found Mrs. Salmi dead
on the kitchen floor. Albert Salmi's body was found in an upstairs
den.
   Police also found two guns they believe were used late Saturday
night or early Sunday, Van Leuven said.
   He said the couple had been separated and that Mrs. Salmi had
been living in the house alone.
   ``I don't know whether they were in the process of a divorce or
not, but it appears there had been some domestic problems,'' he
said.
   Salmi had roles in several Broadway plays, at least 20 feature
films and more than 150 television dramas.
   His portrayal of Bo Decker, the Montana Romeo, in the 1955
Broadway production of `Bus Stop'' helped launch his professional
acting career. It earned him several major awards and led to his
being offered the part of Bo in the film version. Salmi turned it
down because _ like most of his friends in Lee Strasberg's Actors'
Studio _ he thought Hollywood actors were turncoats who sold out
for fast money.
   A New Yorker born in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, Salmi
cherished most the Western Heritage Award from the National Cowboy
Hall of Fame for his portrayal of a cowpoke on television's
``Gunsmoke.''
   Salmi sought out Western character roles and played them with
gusto. He appeared on TV shows such as ``General Electric
Theatre,'' ``Wagon Train,'' ``Man Called Shenandoah,'' ``Bonanza,''
``The Virginian,'' and ``Have Gun Will Travel.''
   Salmi moved to Spokane in the 1980s.

   U.S. businesses may find they are unable to
sell American goods in Europe if they don't adopt the metric
system, the chairman of a House subcommittee said Tuesday.
   ``Within the next three or four years the European Community
will have a unified economy, larger than our own, with unified
product standards based on metric,'' said Rep. Tim Valentine,
D-N.C., chairman of the House Science subcommittee on science,
research and technology.
   ``U.S. manufacturers who cannot produce metric goods may then
find the European door closed to their products.''
   Japanese importers, Valentine said, are already rejecting
American wood products not measured in metric. Wood has been a
major issue in recent U.S. trade negotiations with Japan, which
prefers to import lumber and do its own manufacturing.
   President Bush, after his most recent talks on trade with
Japanese leaders, repeated support for U.S. conversion to metric
standards, Valentine said.
   However, the congressman questioned whether Bush has supported
his words with action.
   J. Dexter Peach, assistant comptroller general, testified that a
General Accounting Office study found little preparedness for a
1988 law requiring government agencies to be using the metric
system as much as possible by the end of September 1991.
   ``The Department of Commerce, as the lead agency, has not
demonstrated a real commitment to guiding it and making it happen,
nor have the other federal agencies demonstrated a serious
commitment to make the transition,'' Peach said.
   He said the GAO study requested by the Science Committee found
only two government agencies that have prepared transition plans:
the Department of Defense and the General Services Administration,
which does household tasks for many other agencies.
   Six other agencies have completed guidelines. But 27, including
13 of the 14 major federal departments, told Peach that more than
three-quarters of the transition work remains to be done.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Accounting Office recommended
Tuesday that spending on new homeports be suspended until the Navy
can justify the program in light of changing world conditions and
cuts in defense spending.
   Martin M. Ferber, director of the GAO's national security and
international affairs division, told a House armed services
subcommittee that the Navy still is relying on a 1982 analysis to
justify the strategic homeports in six Gulf Coast cities and in
Staten Island, N.Y., and Everett, Wash.
   ``We believe it is even more important to revisit that analysis
now because of the changing worldwide threat, declines in the size
of the Navy, and budgetary pressures,'' Ferber said.
   ``The Navy is no longer planning a 600-ship fleet,'' he said.
``The current fleet is less than 550 ships and further reductions
are likely.''
   According to the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, the
Navy had obligations of $488 million for the homeports as of March,
and had spent a total of $298.7 million.
   Of the estimated $799 million cost of developing the eight
homeports, $624.7 million already has been appropriated by Congress
and an additional $25.7 million had been requested for fiscal 1991.
   In addition to the $799 million in federal outlays for the
program, the GAO said, state and local governments have contributed
$198.7 million. An additional $173.6 million in federal funds is
slated for projects at the new homeports because of recommendations
of the base closure commission.
   ``The costs of construction and operating the new homeports will
exceed $1 billion, while the cost of not proceeding with the
homeports has been estimated by the Navy as $636 million,'' Ferber
said. ``However, some of these sunk costs may be recoverable
through alternative uses of the facilities built.''
   Jacqueline Schafer, assistant secretary of the Navy for
installations and environment, said the Navy believes the new
homeports are still ``a valid military objective'' because they are
needed to maintain naval forces in a state of readiness during
peacetime.

<HEAD>Anti-Billboard Legislation Introduced</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to ban new billboards along
federal highways and to empower localities to remove existing signs
was introduced in the Senate on Tuesday.
   The ``Visual Pollution Control Act of 1990'' would place a
moratorium on construction of new billboards on interstate and
federal primary highways, would call for an accurate count of
existing billboards, and would allow states, cities and towns to
decide whether to remove existing roadway advertising along those
highways.
   ``Billboards all too frequently constitute a blight on a
community,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., author of the ``Visual
Pollution Control Act of 1990.'' He said they have ``a tremendous
impact on neighborhoods and therefore neighborhoods should have the
ability to regulate them.''
   The legislation, co-sponsored by Sens. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,
Lloyd Bentson, D-Texas, and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., among others,
would amend the 1965 Highway Beautification Act. Although that law
was originally designed to control billboards, Chafee said the it
``has become so watered-down that the only people who support it
are the billboard industry.''
   Chafee's bill drew the endorsement of Houston Mayor Kathy
Whitmire, president of the National Conference of Mayors, and
Alberta Tinsley-Williams, a county commissioner from Detroit.
   In Houston, work on Interstate 610 has been delayed because the
state has refused to buy a billboard which is in the way. The sign
is valued at $19,042 by the state and $288,000 by the company which
owns it.
   Tinsley Williams said that in Detroit's poor, largely black
neighborhoods, 60 percent of the billboard advertising is for
cigarettes or alcohol. ``We want it out of the faces of our
children,'' she said.
   An investigation in North Carolina found that 500 billboards
still stood a year after their permits had been revoked.
   According to Scenic America, a group supporting the bill, the
typical billboard in 1965 was 15 feet tall and 300 square feet.
Today the typical billboard stands 50 feet tall, usually on
platforms, and is 672 square feet.
   Chafee acknowledged that overcoming the opposition of the
advertising lobby will require a concerted effort and he said he
did not expect his bill to pass this year.
   The Outdoor Advertising Association branded the bill
unconstitutional, saying it would violate the fifth amendment by
allowing states to take down billboards after five years without
compensating the owner.
   According to a Federal Highway Administration Survey, there are
394,000 billboards on federal and interstate highways across the
country compared to 1.1 million in 1965.

the number of homes destroyed since the current eruption began more
than seven years ago.
   A fiery river of molten rock moving through Kalapana Gardens

   The flow overran another a home Monday evening, Butts said.
   Lava continued to move east toward the heart of the subdivision.
The nearest home was 300 feet away, Butts said.
   An evacuation order remained in effect for 50 homes in Kalapana
Gardens. Authorities said 120 homes in the area are threatened.
   Another flow was rolling down the volcano's slopes toward

<HEAD>Panel Says Exxon Isn't Providing Needed Assessment Money</HEAD>

   Exxon has balked at providing additional money
to assess the long-term damage from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in
Alaska, federal officials said Tuesday.
   ``The trustees have requested that Exxon fund the remaining $20
million (of 1989 costs), but so far Exxon has declined to respond
to that request,'' Alan Raul told the House subcommittee on water,
power and offshore energy resources.
   Raul, general counsel of the Agriculture Department, is a member
of the inter-agency trustee council trying to determine the
environmental damages caused by the massive spill. Trustees said
the first year of studies has cost $35.4 million, more than twice
the amount provided by Exxon.
   Additional damage assessment studies this year could cost $30
million, according to an internal trustee council document made
public by the House Interior and Insular Affairs subcommittee.
   C.M. Harrison, executive vice president of Exxon Co. USA, told
the subcommittee that Exxon doesn't plan to make further payments
for damage assessments.
   ``The process has not worked as Exxon anticipated,'' Harrison
said in prepared remarks, adding that Exxon has not had access to
data collected as part of the assessment process.
   Exxon agreed shortly after the March 24, 1989, spill in Alaska's
Prince William Sound to provide $15 million for long-term damage
assessments. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan at the time
characterized the payment as a first step, with additional money to
be sought from the oil company if needed.
   The minutes of a March meeting of the trustee council quoted
Justice Department officals as advising the council it ``should not
expect further money from Exxon,'' according to a transcript
released by the subcommittee.
   The costs of damage assessment will be borne by the federal
government, although some of the money likely will be recovered as
part of the damages sought in a civil suit expected to be filed
against Exxon.
   The oil company has spent more than $1 billion to clean up the
spill, which contaminated miles of Alaska coastline. The Justice
Department is pursuing criminal charges against Exxon that could
lead to fines and penalties of more than $600 million.
   Meanwhile, several environmental groups called the federal
damage assessement process inadequate and said that money shortages
are causing the trustees to curtail some studies essential to
determining overall damage to wildlife and natural resources.
   The trustees decided at their March meeting not to proceed with
24 of the 63 damage assessment studies.
   ``The lawyers and not the scientists have driven the assessment
process,'' said Erik Olson of the National Wildlife Federation.
   He contended that some of the studies were halted because they
were too expensive and likely would not produce large payoffs in
damage recovery as a result of the eventual civil suit against
Exxon.
   ``Apparently, decisions on which studies to continue are based
at least in part on financial considerations,'' said Robert Adler,
a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   Members of the trustee council are officials of the Agriculture
and Commerce departments and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.

<HEAD>Union Activist Warns That Solidarity Must Break With Government To
Surive</HEAD>

   Solidarity cannot survive unless it makes
a clean break with the government it created, a prominent union
activist warned Tuesday as the labor federation's congress neared
its conclusion.
   During the six-day congress, delegates have sharply differed
over what the union's role should be in a post-Communist Poland _
whether it should remain actively involved in national politics or
return to its trade union roots defending workers' interests.
   The union finds itself losing support among workers because of
harsh austerity measures introduced by the Solidarity-led
government under Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former union
adviser.
   The congress was scheduled to end Tuesday, but organizers said
it might stretch into Wednesday as debates continued on proposals
for the union's draft constitution and program.
   Andrzej Slowik, a Solidarity leader from the textile center of
Lodz, said the labor movement must limit itself to purely union
issues and cease trying to protect the government.
   During the congress, Slowik has emerged as the chief rival to
union leader Lech Walesa, who has advocated a mixed role for the
union, combining politics with trade union issues.
   His views appear to be gaining support among the 487 delegates,
even though he finished a distant second to Walesa in Saturday's
election for the union chairmanship.
   Slowik has said it is clear that Walesa intends to use the union
chairmanship as a stepping stone to the presidency of Poland.
   ``The sooner Walesa leaves us and goes to Belvedere (the
presidential palace), the bigger the chances to save Solidarity,''
Slowik told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday.
``Otherwise, Solidarity may end its existence at the moment of the
fall of the Mazowiecki government.''
   Walesa has waffled on whether he intends to launch a bid for the
presidency, now held by former Communist Party leader Wojciech
Jaruzelski.
   Slowik said the union risks losing support if it remains too
closely linked to the Mazowiecki government's economic ``shock
therapy'' program. The reforms are aimed at reviving Poland's
crisis-ridden economy and introducing capitalism.
   The government has reduced inflation, but nearly 300,000 people,
or 2 percent of the workforce, have lost their jobs so far this
year as unprofitable state-owned enterprises are forced to close.
   ``During the six days of the congress, several more hundred
unemployed were added'' in Lodz, he said.
   Mazowiecki's Solidarity-led coalition was installed as a result
of a political compromise struck by Walesa in August to give Poland
the East bloc's first non-Communist-led government.
   But recent opinion polls have shown that Solidarity's popularity
is falling as the union is being blamed for unpopular government
economic measures, which have hit hard at industrial workers, the
union's traditional base of support.
   Slowik said the union is suffering from sagging membership
because of its leadership's decision ``to take care of the
Mazowiecki government instead of protecting the workers'' and its
continued involvement in ``grand politics.''
   Since regaining its legal status a year ago, Solidarity has
recovered only 2.2 million of the 10 million members it claimed
before the December 1981 martial law crackdown that forced the
union underground for seven years.
   Slowik said he generally agrees with the government's reforms
but wants Solidarity to do more to protect workers from its
effects, including providing more job retraining programs and
fighting for alternative factory cost-saving steps to avert layoffs.
   Solidarity leaders close to Walesa argue that the 10 million
membership figure was exaggerated. They attribute the membership
decline to the emergence of many new political parties and
associations during the past year.
   On Monday, delegates to the congress endorsed a middle road,
passing up the opportunity to either remove the union totally from
politics or immediately form a political party. They approved a
program plank that gives the union the option to eventually create
its own political party and support candidates for parliament.
   ``The union cannot leave politics totally but it should become
more like a trade union, especially in the present economic
situation,'' said delegate Andrzej Kunkiel from Wroclawek in
western Poland.
   Solidarity, which emerged as the East bloc's first independent
trade union during a 1980 strike wave, held its only previous
congress in the fall of 1981, just months before the military
crackdown.

<HEAD>Government Executes More Than Half Of Mutineers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan's military government on Tuesday
executed more than half of the participants in an alleged coup
attempt less than 24 hours after their coup was crushed.
   A statement broadcast by official Radio Omdurman said 28
officers, including three retired generals and a brigadier, were
executed by firing squad after a summary court-martial.
   Military tribunals continued to work. A colonel was acquitted
but the trial of other officers alleged to be involved in the coup
was still going on.
   Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir's ruling junta, which took power
in its own coup last June 30, said the coup attempt crushed Monday
was the second phase of a coup plot originally put down in March.
   Government spokesmen said 30 officers were brought before the
court-martial after their arrest Monday, and that 20 officers and
civilians arrested after the March incident also were on trial.
   The statement did not specify how many suspects remained
awaiting trial.
   On Monday, el-Bashir said the abortive coup was masterminded by
``the alliance in coalition with the outlaws.''
   ``The alliance'' was possibly a reference to political parties
disbanded by el-Bashir after his junta took control of the country
June 30.
   The government has often used the term ``outlaws'' to refer to
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, which has been waging a
seven-year insurgency seeking autonomy and greater economic reforms
for the country's three southern provinces.
   The government statement Tuesday also did not make clear why
Col. Hassan Abdalla Atta, a pilot, was acquitted. There were
reports he was granted clemency in exchange for testifying against
the others.
   ``Death by firing squad has been implemented, and the trials are
still going on for the rest of the participants'' said the
statement read on Radio Omdurman and distributed by the Sudan News
Agency.
   The executed officers included the two retired senior officers
accused of leading the alleged plot. They and the others were
charged with ``high treason and mutiny against the legitimate
government,'' the official statement said.
   The alleged coup leaders were identified as retired Maj. Gen.
Abdul-Kadir al-Kadaru and Brigadier Mohammed Osman Hamid Karrar.
Other retired flag officers reported executed were retired Gens.
Khalid al-Zain Ali, a pilot, and Osman Idris Balol.
   In addition, four colonels, one retired, and five lieutenant
colonels, two of whom were retired, went before the firing squad.
   A member of el-Bashir's 15-officer military council, Brigadier
Osman Ahmed al-Hassan, promised ``a fair but prompt trial to anyone
involved in the abortive coup attempt.'' He spoke in an interview
published Tuesday in the newspaper Al-Sudan Al-Hadith.
   Mohamed Khogali Salihein, the information minister, insisted the
alleged plotters were persuaded to surrender with no bloodshed or
casualties.
   But informed sources in Khartoum on Monday reported limited
gunfire exchanges when the plotters tried to take over Khartoum
International Airport and Radio Omdurman, the official government
station.
   A third group of officers who tried to enter the downtown
headquarters of the armed forces general command shot a guard in
the hand before they were overpowered, the sources said. That group
apparently was searching for el-Bashir.
   The coup attempt started around midnight Sunday. The government
closed the airport, cut communications with the outside and blocked
bridges for several hours.
   By 7 a.m. Monday, life was back to normal in the capital.
   On Tuesday, Radio Omdurman broadcast a stream of telegrams in
support of el-Bashir. A pro-government demonstration was announced
for Tuesday night.

<HEAD>China Agrees To Give Credits To Soviets For Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China agreed Tuesday to provide credits to the
Soviet Union to pay for the import of Chinese consumer goods, the
official Soviet news agency Tass said.
   The announcement came on the second day of Premier Li Peng's
visit here, the first by a Chinese head of government in 26 years.
   The Soviet Union suffers from a chronic shortage of basic
consumer goods ranging from toothpaste to matches, and has
increasingly turned to foreigners for help.
   Tass did not say what goods China would provide or give the
monetary value of the deal.
   For its part, the Soviet Union will extend a credit to China for
building a nuclear power station in China, Tass said. The news
agency also did not say how much that deal was worth or where the
plant would be built.
   The agreements on the credits were signed by Soviet External
Economic Relations Minister Konstantin Katushev and Chinese Deputy
Foreign Trade Minister Li Lanqin, Tass said.
   Li met Tuesday with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who
visited China last May.
   Li's four-day trip is intended to ease border tensions and
improve relations between the longtime rivals for leadership of the
Communist world.
   ``A good and interesting meeting, that's how it was assessed by
the participants,'' Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim
Perfiliev told a Moscow briefing.
   Perfiliev said the leaders discussed further military cutbacks
on the Soviet-Chinese border and plans for strengthening economic
ties.
   Tass said Li and Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov signed an
agreement on cooperation through the year 2,000 that covers fuel
and power, metallurgy, transport, communications, agriculture,
electronics, forestry and environmental protection. Coooperation
also is planned in health and space exploration.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and his Chinese
counterpart, Qian Qichen, signed an agreement on mututal reduction
of armed forces and military confidence-building measures along the
two countries' border. The two countries have been negotiating the
troop reductions for several years.
   Tuesday's agreement said Soviet and Chinese armed forces would
be kept to a ``minimum corresponding to normal good-neighborly
relations.''
   In their meeting, Gorbachev and Li agreed that there is no
single model for realizing socialist ideas. ``Each country has its
own history, own specifics, own starting level of development, and
it's impossible not to consider it,'' Tass said.
   That theme was also evident Monday, when Li made a speech
emphasizing that his country and the Soviet Union have the right to
tailor reforms to their own needs.
   ``Both are socialist countries and conduct reform and
perestroika in accordance with the realities of their countries,''
Peng said in remarks reported by Tass.
   Western diplomats in Beijing said China has stressed it would
never be a docile Soviet ally as in the 1950s.
   The ideological hard-liners who now rule China reportedly blame
Gorbachev for the fall of Communist parties in Eastern Europe and
consider perestroika _ Gorbachev's program of political and
economic reform _ as a threat to socialism.
   China and the Soviet Union split over ideological differences in
1960 and fought a brief border war in 1969. In 1972, China restored
relations with the United States, in part because then-leader Mao
Tse-tung saw the Soviet Union as China's most serious military
threat.

<HEAD>US `Ready To Pursue' Ties with Hard-Line Albania</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department, responding to an
overture from Albania's hard-line, Marxist government, said Tuesday
it is ``ready to pursue'' discussions with that country on
normalizing diplomatic relations.
   In a speech last week, Albanian President Ramiz Alia had
expressed interest in establishing relations with both the United
States and the Soviet Union.
   The United States and Albania have had no diplomatic ties since
1939. Albania is one of a handful of countries with which the
United States does not have such ties.
   Since Alia came to office in 1985, he has slowly attempted to
end the isolationist policies imposed by his predecessor, Enver
Hoxha. Albania broke relations with the Soviet Union in 1961
because Hoxha felt that Moscow was deviating from Marxist ideology.
   After noting Alia's expression of interest in restoring ties,
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said, ``As the
United States has stated in the past, our door is open to the
resumption of diplomatic relations and we are ready to pursue
discussions toward this end.''
   Alia's speech last week followed a six-month period in which
Albanian officials had been sending out ``feelers'' through third
parties expressing interest in broader contacts with the United
States, a State Department official said.
   The third parties included foreign diplomats and Albanian
Americans who visited Albania. The officials were unable to cite
any direct discussions between U.S. and Albanian officials.
   Another sign of the more flexible Albanian attitude was its
decision to permit Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy, D-Mass., to visit.
Kennedy's office said Tuesday he expects to visit there in the
first week of June.
   The Albanian overtures to the United States apparently began
after other communist regimes in East Europe collapsed. Unlike
those other governments, however, Albania has never been an East
Bloc member, instead pursuing a policy of self-sufficiency.
   In his speech last week, Alia noted the ``wide gap'' that has
existed between Albania and the superpowers and said that ``we meet
friendship with friendship.''
   He said that as a result of recent international developments,
``the problem of the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with
the United States of America and the Soviet Union is on the
agenda.''
   lia also expressed interest in joining the so-called Helsinki
process, the 35-nation conclave that meets to discuss issues
related to European security and cooperation. Albania is the only
European country that is not a member of the Helsinki group.
   A State Department report on human rights conditions worldwide,
released in February, described Albania as a Marxist-Leninist
dictatorship where the 3.3 million residents are permitted ``only
very limited political and civil rights.''
   In her statement, Ms. Tutwiler said that diplomatic relations do
not constitute an endorsement of the policies of a given government.
   ``Establishment of diplomatic relations would create the
opportunity for dialogue through which we would be able to
communicate our concerns and encourage respect for human rights in
Albania,'' she said.

   Former Mayor Andrew Young filed Tuesday as a

nation's second black elected governor _ and Georgia's first _ is

   Young joins a race in which four other Democrats qualified
Monday. Many observers expect a runoff between Young and Lt. Gov.
Zell Miller.
   ``If it were held today, that's what we would have. But I'm just
getting started,'' Young said. ``And I'm going to use these next

   Virginia's Douglas Wilder last year became the nation's first

   The other Democrats in the Georgia race are state Rep. Lauren
McDonald, state Sen. Roy Barnes and former Gov. Lester Maddox.
   Republican candidates are state Rep. Johnny Isakson, generally
considered the GOP front runner, businessman Bob Wood and Lincoln
Veazy, a retired military man. Former Superior Court Judge Greeley
Ellis also is campaigning for the nomination.
   The fee to qualify for the governor's race is $2,600.
   The primary election is July 17 and the general election Nov. 6.

<TEXT>
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is an
unlikely president, a slim, elegant homebody thrust into public
life by widowhood and civil war.
   One of her first official acts as president will be a tribute to
her slain husband, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, whose assassination
helped spark the 1979 revolution that brought the outgoing
Sandinista government to power.
   Directly after her inauguration as Nicaragua's president on
Wednesday, Mrs. Chamorro will place flowers on her husband's grave.
   The gesture sums up Mrs. Chamorro's political biography: a
martyr's widow, a woman whose divided family symbolizes the
conflicts that have split this nation of 3.5 million.
   Peace and reconciliation are Mrs. Chamorro's promise to
Nicaragua, which is emerging from nine years of civil war that
claimed 30,000 lives and left the economy in tatters.
   Mrs. Chamorro, 60, was chosen to run against leftist President
Daniel Ortega because of her powerful symbolic value. She was the
one person on whom all sectors of the loose opposition coalition
could agree.
   She showed mettle, if not political sophistication, throughout a
tough campaign. She stumped the country despite a broken knee.
   Invariably dressed in white, Mrs. Chamorro was lifted onto
platforms at rallies in her wheelchair. One political analyst
described her as a Virgin Mary figure in his post-mortem of her
Feb. 25 landslide victory.
   Mrs. Chamorro, the youngest daughter of a provincial landowning
family, never envisioned herself in a political role. She was
raised to be a wife and mother, a role she gladly embraced after
marrying Chamorro.
   ``He was my first love, my first boyfriend,'' said Mrs.
Chamorro, who visits his grave every week.
   Chamorro, publisher of the daily newspaper, La Prensa, was also
one of the most prominent opponents of the Somoza family
dictatorship. Mrs. Chamorro stayed in the background.
   Chamorro was assassinated in January 1978, presumably on orders
from dictator Anastasio Somoza. When Somoza was ousted the
following year, Mrs. Chamorro was a member of the first ruling
junta.
   She quit after nine months, later saying the leftist Sandinistas
betrayed her husband's democratic ideals.
   She enjoys the comparison to another political widow who led a
movement that ousted an entrenched government, Corazon Aquino of
the Philippines.
   Like many Nicaraguan families, the Chamorros were divided by the
revolution.
   Daughter Claudia and son Carlos Fernando, publisher of the
Sandinista party newspaper Barricada, are dedicated Sandinistas.
Another son, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Jr., was a leader of the
U.S.-backed Contras and daughter Cristiana is the editor of La
Prensa, an opposition newspaper during Sandinista rule.
   In many ways, family is still the center of Mrs. Chamorro's
life. She relies for political advice and counsel on a tight inner
circle that includes Pedro Joaquin Jr. and Cristiana's husband,
Antonio Lacayo.
   She has taken very little direct hand in transfer-of-power
negotiations with the Sandinistas, and is known for preferring to
discuss her grandchildren while aides huddle over policy.
   But the prominence of her family advisers has created divisions
within the United National Opposition, the 14-party coalition she
led to victory. One of Mrs. Chamorro's greatest problems as
president may be navigating the political thicket of warring
interests within UNO.
   Other challenges that might daunt even the most skilled
politician await her. She must rebuild a shattered economy and
contend with the Sandinistas in their new role as a solid
opposition force.
   After years of war, revolution and poverty, Nicaragua is like a
divided family. Mrs. Chamorro may lack political sophistication,
but she understands divided families.
   When Ortega came to visit her after his election defeat, he was
not at all sure how she would receive him after the bitter campaign.
   ``Papito, come here, I love you,'' Mrs. Chamorro exclaimed,
hugging her defeated opponent.
   Her mission, she says, is to reconcile the nation, to bring it
peace. And one of the first steps toward this goal, she said this
week, will be the declaration of a general amnesty.
   ``Peace, reconciliation and pardon will be the parameters of my
government,'' she said.
   ``I pardon my husband's killers.''

<HEAD>French and Romanian TV Networks Argue Over Ceausescu Execution
Tape</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK McDOWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dispute has flared up over the rights to a
videotape showing the execution of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu,
pitting the head of Romanian television against a French TV network
that broadcast the footage.
   The 90-minute tape aired Sunday by the private TF1 network
depicted the secret trial, execution and burial of the Romanian
Communist dictator and his wife Dec. 25 at a military base outside
Bucharest.
   The network claims a Sunday-night record 10 million people
watched the broadcast, ``The Ceausescus' Final Hours.''
   TF1 says it paid $9,000 to an unidentified Romanian for the tape
after an Austrian network rejected it. Network officials called the
price ``cheap'' and billed the broadcast Sunday as a world
exclusive.
   But Razvan Theodorescu, head of state-run Free Romanian
Television, said Monday that TF1 had purchased an illegal copy of
the tape, undercutting a deal being negotiated with a French sales
agent over world rights to the film.
   ``The rights to this cassette belong to the Romanian
government,'' Theodorescu said in Bucharest, before leaving on a
trip to Paris. ``It's immoral to want to make money with a historic
document reflecting the drama lived through by the Romanian
people.''
   He said TF1 was duped into buying a ``pirate cassette'' and
accused those who sold it of criminal behavior.
   Patrick Le Lay, president-director general of TF1, denied that
any illegal act was committed.
   ``What was proposed to us was the uncut cassette of the trial,
and we haven't pirated anybody,'' he said Monday.
   The tape shows Ceausescu weeping and his wife screaming for
mercy as guards tied their hands shortly before their execution.
The camera focused on Elena Ceausescu lying in a stream of blood
after a firing squad gunned down the couple.
   Extracts of the tape first aired in December. But the long
version broadcast by TF1 showed for the first time the full trial
of the couple by the secret military-civilian tribunal that
sentenced them to death.
   The show-trial atmosphere and the brutal, graphic images of the
execution drew criticism in the French media.
   The conservative daily Le Figaro called it ``a political trial
that bears no relation to justice. It would doubtless have been
better to kill the Ceausescus right away than to put on this
macabre farce.''
   The TF1 broadcast scooped Free Romanian Television, which aired
the footage later Sunday to mark the four-month anniversary of the
revolution that ended Ceausescu's 25-year rule.
   The French network billed its version as the complete,
definitive account of the couple's final hours.
   But Theodorescu claimed after arriving in Paris late Monday that
a more complete tape contains additional debate among the tribunal
members over charges that the Ceausescus committed genocide against
the Romanian people.
   The Romanian government will continue distribution negotiations
over the longer tape with French agent Jean-Loup Sulitzer,
Theodorescu said. Earnings will go toward technological
improvements in Romanian television.

   The House approved a non-binding resolution
Tuesday asserting that a united Jerusalem is the capital of Israel,
a position at odds with official U.S. policy.
   The 378 to 34 vote, with six members voting ``present,'' came
despite arguments that such a statement by Congress would cause
resentment among Arab states and complicate Bush administration
efforts to achieve a Mideast peace.
   The resolution was identical to one approved March 22 by the
Senate. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., later complained
that the move had damaged peace efforts and said he regretted his
support for it.
   Jerusalem, regarded as a holy city by Christians, Moslems and
Jews, has since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war been under Israeli
control, and unfettered access to all holy sites is allowed.
   U.S. policy holds that Jerusalem's status must be determined
through negotiations among all parties and does not recognize it as
the Israeli capital.
   Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. and the chief House sponsor of the
resolution, said he acted because President Bush had called into
question Jerusalem's status by linking predominantly Arab East
Jerusalem to the occupied West Bank in a statement about Israeli
settlements.
   ``Jerusalem is the heart and soul of Israel,'' Engel said during
a brief debate on the resolution. ``If the Israelis are willing to
take risks for peace, they need to know the United States will
stand by them, not pull the rug out from under them.''
   But Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said any attempt by Congress to
give formal institutional support to Israel's claim that Jerusalem
is its capital would unnecessarily inflame an already hostile
situation.
   ``For America to play a constructive role, we need to have good
relations with a number of parties in the Middle East, not just
one. ... We must be credible to all parties, not just one.''
   Obey said the non-binding resolution was nothing more than ``an
institutional press release.''
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said Congress should be discussing
the Likud Party's efforts to provide aid for settling Jews in the
Christian sector of Jerusalem ``while lying, lying about the
action.'' Lawmakers should be debating the wisdom of approving $400
million in U.S. loan guarantees to house new Israeli settlers, he
said.
   The resolution is ``an affront to the Arab community, the
Christian community and the Greek Orthodox community. ... We should
be seeking to bring the parties together instead of polarizing the
situation,'' Bonior said.
   Similar comments by Dole last week touched off a dispute among
Republicans, with a group of House GOP leaders criticizing the
senator for not supporting Israel strongly enough.
   In Beirut, a group calling itself Islamic Jihad
Movement-Jerusalem threatened to launch attacks against Americans
worldwide unless the Senate reverses its action.
   ``The American Senate should reverse its decision in 10 days, or
else every American inside and outside Moslem countries will be a
target of terrorism and revenge,'' the group said in a statement
delivered to a Beirut newspaper.

<HEAD>Kerrey Predicts Farm Crisis Without More Monetary Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said Tuesday that
there will be a farm crisis in two years if government support for
agriculture isn't increased.
   President Bush, however, disagreed.
   ``There are many things I respect about Senator Kerrey,'' Bush
said. ``Sometimes we have a philosophical difference of opinion. I
have a different view on this.''
   Kerrey has introduced legislation being used by the Senate
Agriculture Committee to prepare its commodities section of the
1990 farm bill. He made his comments to the National Association of
Agricultural Journalists; Bush addressed the group later in the day.
   Farm economy, Kerrey said, has improved considerably since the
early 1980s. However, he said the recovery was fragile and that $12
billion is needed annually over the five-year life of the farm bill
to assure stability.
   ``If you don't provide this level of funding, in two years you
are going to see this recovery vanish,'' Kerrey said.
   The budget the administration sent to Congress in January calls
for $10.2 billion to be spent on commodity programs in the next
fiscal year. The crops protected by those subsidies are the big
money crops _ wheat, corn, cotton, soybeans and rice.
   Kerrey said that failed farming operations brought on by
insufficient government support would cost more taxpayer money in
the long run than the annual $12 billion he's advocating.
   He criticized Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter as an
advocate for the free market instead of the farmer.
   Yeutter, who has a family farm in Kerrey's home state, said farm
income need not be dependent on the government.
   ``There's a market out there,'' said Yeutter, who appeared with
Bush. ``All of us are concerned about farm income.''
   Yeutter said it was impossible to predict the agricultural
economic situation in the United States beyond the next fiscal year
because the outcome of international trade talks _ the Uruguay
Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT _ are
not complete.
   The Bush administration has been working through GATT to open
the international marketplace by removing subsidies, which Yeutter
and other officials say distort prices.

   For an hour Tuesday, the Supreme Court
grappled with an important libel law issue contained in a former
high school wrestling coach's 15-year-old lawsuit against an Ohio
newspaper.
   The court is being asked to decide whether the Constitution's
free-speech protections immunize all expressions of opinion, as
opposed to assertions of fact, from libel lawsuits.
   First, however, the justices may have to tell judges nationwide
how to distinguish fact from opinion.
   The fact-opinion distinction is important. Courts traditionally
have barred libel suits over expressions of opinion even though the
high court never has said explicitly that such protection is
constitutionally required.
   The justices spent much of Tuesday's argument session trying to
figure out whether to put a ``fact'' or ``opinion'' tag on a 1975
sports column that accused Michael Milkovich of lying under oath.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Anthony M. Kennedy asked the most questions. All three seemed
to consider the sued-over statement an assertion of fact.
   Questions from Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor
and Byron R. White were more difficult to characterize. Justices
William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun asked
no questions.
   The sued-over column was written by Ted Diadiun and appeared in
the News Herald of Lake County, published by the Lorain Journal Co.
   Milkovich was coaching Maple Heights High School's wrestling
team at a 1974 home meet against Mentor High School when a melee
involving both teams and spectators erupted. Several wrestlers were
hospitalized.
   Diadiun, who was at the meet, wrote several articles criticizing
Milkovich's conduct.
   In a Jan. 8, 1975, column, Diadiun accused the coach and H. Don
Scott, then superintendent of the Maple Heights public schools, of
lying to a judge who overturned disciplinary measures against the
Maple Heights team.
   During extensive litigation, Milkovich won two preliminary
rounds before the Ohio Supreme Court. In a 1984 decision, the state
court ruled that Diadiun's statements about Milkovich were reported
as fact, not opinion.
   But in ruling on Scott's related libel suit two years later, the
Ohio Supreme Court reversed its 1984 ruling and said Diadiun's
statements were expressions of his opinion.
   In an unusual move, the Ohio court used its Aug. 6, 1986,
decision in Scott's case to doom as well Milkovich's suit against
the newspaper and Diadiun.
   Holding up a 1975 headline that said Milkovich ``Beat the Law
with the Big Lie,'' Milkovich attorney Brent English of Cleveland
told the justices, ``This is quintessentially an assertion of
fact.''
   But Richard Panza of Lorain, Ohio, argued for the newspaper and
Diadiun that ``when people read sports columns they expect to read
opinion.''
   Gusts of laughter filled the courtroom after Justice Kennedy
responded, ``I gave up reading sports columns because there's
nothing but legal news in them.''
   Panza's most persistent interrogator was Justice Scalia, who at
one point asked him, ``Doesn't it trouble you that people's
reputations can be destroyed this way?''
   Panza said, ``Yes, it does trouble me.'' He then quickly added
that the column at issue was not libelous.
   Diadiun, 42 and now an editor with The Cleveland Plain Dealer,
watched the session from the courtroom's press section.
   Milkovich, 68 and recovering from triple bypass heart surgery,
did not attend. In a recent interview, he told The New York Times
he was too weak to make the trip from his Maple Heights home.
   A decision is expected by July.
   The case is Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal Co., 89-645.

<HEAD>Anti-Communist Demonstrators Demand Iliescu Resignation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of anti-Communist
demonstrators regrouped in a main Bucharest square hours after
being dispersed by riot police Tuesday to demand the resignation of
Interim President Ion Iliescu.
   About 3,500 demonstrators waved their fists and cheered as one
speaker equated the National Salvation Front _ Iliescu's party _
with the Soviet KGB. Many shouted, ``Down With Communism!''
   It was the third day of nearly constant protest against Iliescu
and the Front, which are linked in the minds of many Romanians with
past Communist excesses.
   Iliescu was appointed interim president in the wake of the
bloody December revolution that overthrew dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu. He served under Ceausescu but fell out of favor and was
demoted to lesser jobs in the Communist Party.
   His Communist past and that of other Front officials makes them
suspect in the eyes of those Romanians who claim the Front has been
infiltrated by Marxists paying only lip service to democracy.
   In a morning session of parliament, Nica Leon, president of the
Liberal Democratic Party and a member of the governing Council of
National Unity, said the protesters rejected what they considered
the Communist elite still leading the country.
   ``Those people want the (former) Communists toppled from the
leadership,'' he told the Council. The Council, in which the Front
shares power with opposition groups, is acting as a makeshift
parliament until elections scheduled for May 20.
   Iliescu described the protesters as ``thugs.'' That drew
protests from opposing legislators who noted that Ceausescu used
such language to label his political opponents.
   The demonstrations at University Square began Sunday and lasted
uninterrupted until Tuesday at dawn, when club-wielding, helmeted
riot police forcibly dispersed about 200 protesters who had
remained in the square.
   Protesters began reassembling during the morning and continued
their rally into Tuesday evening.
   It was the first time since Ceausescu's overthrow that police
force was used to break up an anti-Communist street protest.
   The demonstration was the chief topic during a session of the
interim parliament that continued into the evening and was
broadcast live by state television.
   The inspector general of police, identified only as Gen.
Diamandescu, said nobody was beaten during Tuesday's police
intervention, but three policemen were hospitalized after being
injured by demonstrators.
   That assertion was disputed both by legislators and by
demonstrators who said in interviews that they had been beaten.
   ``This morning the policemen came and clubbed us into the
ground,'' Silviu Galniceanu, a 23-year-old photographer told The
Associated Press.
   In a related development, Ion Ratiu, the presidential candidate
of the National Peasants Party in the May 20 elections, said his
life had been threatened by a mob instigated by the Front.
   Ratiu, a Romanian millionaire who returned from decades of
British self-exile this year, said he had to be spirited out of a
police station in Buzau, about 120 miles northeast of Bucharest, in
a milk van after an angry crowd threatened to storm the station.
   ``I thought, `We'll be lucky if we get away with our lives,'''
said Ratiu, 72. He said he planned to take a personal physician
along on future campaign trips because of fears of similar threats.
   The fervently anti-Communist National Peasant Party claims about
600,000 members, making them the chief rivals of the Front, which
asserts it has 800,000 followers.

<HEAD>Panel Extends Wool, Honey Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Agriculture Committee voted Tuesday
to extend government programs for wool, mohair and honey for five
years with virtually no changes.
   ``The wool and mohair title (of the 1990 farm bill) is
essentially a five-year extension of the program for wool in the
1985 farm bill,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
   The measure:
   _Authorizes loans, purchases and payments by the Agriculture
Department to help the wool and mohair industry.
   _Sets a payment rate that would be the difference between the
national average of all domestic wool receipts and the price the
government predetermined that producers should get. Each producer's
payment from the government would be calculated by applying this
rate to net proceeds for wool sold the preceding year.
   The honey section of the farm bill also would be little changed
from current policies.
   The price support for honey has dropped an average 5 percent
each year for five years. Under the new legislation, support prices
would be frozen at 56.86 cents a pound through 1995.
   Loan repayment rates would be unchanged.

<HEAD>Sasser Says Bush Not Yet Serious About Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser
told his divided panel Tuesday that President Bush wasn't yet
serious enough about cutting the deficit to warrant a White House
budget summit.
   ``Summitry simply doesn't make sense unless all sides are
serious,'' said Sasser, D-Tenn., as his committee began work on its
version of the $1.2 trillion fiscal 1991 spending plan.
   ``At this point, at least, the administration isn't serious
about it.''
   Sasser presented the committee with a series of budget options
cutting the deficit up to $50 billion in the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1. The Pentagon would account for up to $20 billion of that
savings _ a level conservatives appear unwilling to accept.
   ``The Congress is not going to adopt those numbers,'' said Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   He and most other Republicans, led by Sen. Pete V. Domenici of
New Mexico, the senior Republican on the panel, made clear the GOP
won't support the Democrats' budget.
   Domenici said he hoped the committee would act quickly so talks
with the White House could begin.
   ``We are not going to be obstructionist on this side,'' Domenici
said.
   The spectre of a summer White House summit was raised on the
Senate floor Tuesday as the two parties settled a dispute that was
holding up action on the child care and Central American aid bills.
   Senate Republicans backed off a threat to force a vote on Bush's
capital gains tax cut as part of the child care bill. In exchange,
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, assured Minority Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas that the tax cut would be part of any summit on
the big issues.
   ``If such discussions do occur ... I would urge that any and all
matters be put on the table,'' Mitchell said.
   White House budget director Richard Darman has been agitating
for a budget summit, apparently in part because of a deteriorating
economic picture.
   Darman last week criticized the plan passed by the House Budget
Committee as inadequate _ because it relied on the administration's
own, faulty economic projections.
   ``He's getting nervous in the service,'' Sen. Ernest F.
Hollings, D-S.C., said Tuesday of Darman's maneuvering away from
his own position.
   Hollings described the Senate committee as ``all over the lot''
in its efforts to draft a budget, with several Democrats _
including himself _ proposing their own plans.
   Sasser expressed confidence a consensus would emerge on a plan
with about $40 billion in deficit reduction, enough to satisfy the
requirements of the Gramm-Rudman budget law. He declined to say
what he thought would make up the package.
   The House could begin debate as early as Wednesday on its budget.
   The House plan envisions about $295.5 billion in military
spending next year, more than $3 billion more than Sasser is
proposing. Bush asked for about $303 billion.
   Sasser, like the House and Bush, is proposing about $14 billion
in new taxes next year. While Bush says the capital gains cut would
raise a big chunk of his revenue, the Democrats aren't saying which
taxes they would raise.

   Pneumonia-stricken Elizabeth
Taylor's spirits were good despite an uncomfortable ventilator that
helped her breathe after surgery to determine the cause of her
illness, her doctor said Tuesday.
   Dr. Michael Roth, a longtime friend and Miss Taylor's physician
for 10 years, said the 58-year-old actress was ``certainly stable
for the moment with the very slightest bit of improvement.''
   ``It started with viral pneumonia,'' Roth said in a telephone
interview after seeing Miss Taylor in the intensive care unit at
St. Johns Hospital and Health Center. In addition to the
ventilator, intravenous lines were connected to the actress.
   ``We are trying to prevent infection so we are using IV drugs,''
Roth said. ``Her spirits are good and she's feeling a little bit
better.''
   The Academy Award-winning actress has deteriorated markedly
since what was initially described as a sinus infection.
   Miss Taylor's three doctors and her publicist Chen Sam, who flew
in from New York on Tuesday, scheduled a Wednesday afternoon news
conference to discuss the case.
   ``It's the most sick she's been under my care,'' Roth said late
Monday. ``Right now she's on an even plane. We are guardedly
optimistic. It's a non-specific virus. We haven't been able to
isolate it.''
   Miss Taylor's condition had stabilized after surgery Sunday to
remove a piece of lung tissue for biopsy, doctors said. Test
results were expected Thursday.
   People keeping a bedside vigil included her four children, Maria
Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopher and Michael Wilding.
   Television news crews and reporters outside the hospital were
prevented by security officers from entering the hospital. Hospital
spokeswoman Roxanne Yamaguchi referred inquiries to the publicist
for the actress, who won Oscars for ``Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?'' and ``Butterfield 8.''
   ``She is seriously ill,'' Miss Taylor's doctors said in a
statement released Monday. ``After surgery, her breathing is now
being assisted by a ventilator.Her condition is presently
stabilizing and her physicians are pleased with her progress.''
   Miss Taylor entered Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital on April 9
with a persistent fever and sinus infection. When her condition
worsened, she was transferred April 16 to St. Johns.
   In a statement after arriving at the larger hospital, the
actress issued a statement denying rumors that she was suffering
from an AIDS-related condition.
   Miss Taylor was moved to the intensive care unit on Friday, her
physicians said in a statement without elaborating on her
deteriorating health.
   ``She's not well. She's not on her death bed or anything,'' Ms.
Sam said.
   Miss Taylor has been plagued with health problems for years,
particularly recurring back troubles from the filming of the 1945
movie ``National Velvet,'' when she fell off a horse.
   In 1983, she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills
and pain killers prescribed for a range of health problems.
   Miss Taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug abuse problems
at the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage.
   During a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961, Miss Taylor
underwent a tracheotomy, in which an incision was cut into her
windpipe to help her breathe. She appeared at the 1961 Academy
Awards with a bandage over her tracheotomy scar as she accepted the
``Butterfield 8'' Oscar.
   Dr. Patricia Murray, an infectious disease specialist treating
the actress, said last week that Miss Taylor had pneumonia and was
``being treated intravenously with antibiotics and will remain
hospitalized'' indefinitely.

   Condemned murderers who waive their right to
appeal and say they want to die may be executed even if no appeals
court reviews their cases, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
   The decision will let Arkansas authorities execute a man who
killed 16 relatives and acquaintances during a 1987 rampage. No
state appeals court has reviewed the validity of his convictions or
sentence.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices ruled that only convicted mass
murderer R. Gene Simmons _ and not fellow death row inmate Jonas
Whitmore _ has the legal standing to challenge Simmons' death
sentence.
   Whitmore mounted his challenge even though Simmons prefers death
to end ``the torture and suffering in me.'' Whitmore had asked the
justices to rule that state appeals courts must review all death
sentences _ even when not asked to do so by the condemned murderer.
   In fact, many states provide automatic appellate review in
capital cases, regardless of the defendant's wishes. But Whitmore,
trying to stand in for Simmons, had argued that such review is
constitutionally required.
   The court did not address the constitutional issue, ruling
instead that Whitmore cannot make such an argument in Simmons'
behalf.
   ``Whitmore, having failed to establish that Simmons is
(mentally) unable to proceed on his own behalf, does not have the
legal standing to proceed,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
wrote for the court.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Ruled 6-3 in case that could affect millions of dollars in
movie industry profits that distributors of the Alfred Hitchcock
thriller ``Rear Window'' must share with a literary agent earnings
from the 1954 film's re-release.
   _Ruled 6-2 that the U.S. territory of Guam and its officials may
not be sued for allegedly violating a much-used federal civil
rights law.
   The decision in the death penalty case lifted a stay the
justices had imposed on the eve of Simmons' scheduled execution
last year. Arkansas officials will be free to schedule a new
execution date as soon as they officially receive word of the
court's ruling, 25 days from Tuesday.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan, who oppose
capital punishment in all circumstances, dissented from Tuesday's
ruling.
   ``The court needlessly abdicates its grave responsibility to
ensure that no person is wrongly executed,'' Marshall wrote for the
two.
   Simmons, 49, killed his wife, three sons, four daughters, a
son-in-law, a daughter-in-law and four grandchildren at his home
near Dover, Ark. He killed two acquaintances in the nearby town of
Russellville. The victims, all slain in the days surrounding
Christmas 1987, were shot or strangled.
   He consistently has refused to appeal his convictions and death
sentence.
   ``We are free to execute Mr. Simmons as long as he wishes to be
executed,'' James Lee, a spokesman for state Attorney General Steve
Clark, said after learning of Tuesday's ruling.
   The sister of Simmons' slain wife, Becky, said she was relieved
by the decision.
   ``All I can say is I know he wants to die, and it's now one
chapter I know will be closed,'' said Viola O'Shields of Fort
Payne, Ala. ``It's been a most long, very hard three years.''
   Mrs. O'Shields said she won't tell her mother, 81-year-old Maye
Novak of Briggsdale, Colo., about the ruling until a new execution
date is set.
   ``She has not been well since all this happened, and maybe this
will relieve some of the stress and pain she's gone through,'' Mrs.
O'Shields said.

   Five grade school youngsters wearing crisp
white uniforms bowed stiffly before members of a House
Appropriations subcommittee Tuesday and recited ``Four Daily
Affirmations'' from their lessons in discipline _ lessons that
committee members applauded.
   ``I am smart because I always learn something good everyday. I
am perfect because I never make mistakes knowingly. I like myself
because I always take action to make things happen. I am happy that
I am me,'' the children said.
   The youngsters from Washington's Amidon Elementary School gave a
brief demonstration of what they have been learning in a ``Joy of
Discipline'' program at their school offered by Jhoon Rhee, who
describes himself as the father of Tae Kwon Do, a Korean style of
unarmed combat, in the United States.
   Rhee interspersed his testimony before the subcommittee on
labor, health and human services, education and related agencies
with the demonstrations. He said he wants to help restore ``the
forgotten good old American custom'' of respect, as well as
classroom discipline and motivation, by getting schools to offer
``attitude'' classes.
   ``I sincerely believe that the first thing we should teach our
children is the purpose of life; and the second, the way to reach
that purpose; and the third, how to enjoy the process.,'' Rhee said.
   Also performing was Rhee's star pupil, Marvin White, who
demonstrated his skills of breaking boards without the benefits of
arms and with only one leg.
   The subcommittee room exploded into applause with various
congressmen offering words of praise.
   ``Master Rhee, you're good for this country,'' said Subcommittee
Chairman William Natcher, D-Ky.
   Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., added, ``You're helping to instill
confidence in youngsters. That's something that's really needed.''
   Rhee, who has instructed members of Congress in martial arts for
25 years, said his program was developed through trial and error
and is saturated with the philosophies and strategies of Tae Kwon
Do.
   The children learn to pay ``undivided attention'' to the
teacher, love and respect the teacher, and are taught to separate
license _ ``an act approved by the animal instinct'' _ from freedom
_ ``an act approved by a conscience,'' he said.
   Rhee, who became an American citizen in 1973, suggested that
American schools teach the attitude class an hour a day.
   ``Children are taught self-discipline and self-respect which are
the foundations for all learning. Our children must be taught to
respect their parents, teachers, elders, peers and evertying in the
universe,'' he said.
   The House subcommittee hearing was one of a series on the
proposed budgets for the Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education departments for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The
proposed Education Department budget is $24.6 billion, up from
$24.1 billion in the current year.

   Pedro Mahumane walked through a crowd on a
busy square Tuesday and, for once, failed to draw stares from the
people around him.
   ``People see me, they know I am a foreigner'' said the
28-year-old Mozambican. ``Today, we are all foreigners.''
   Mahumane was among an estimated 1,500 Africans, Vietnamese,
Arabs and Germans who marched through the East German capital to
protest what they say is a surge in racism spawned by the push to
unification.
   East Germany is home to 800,000 so-called ``guest workers,''
most of them Vietnamese, Mozambicans or Cubans sent by their
countries years ago.
   Many were sent as part of agreements made between their
governments and the former Stalinist regime that was toppled in
October. Some were promised skilled jobs but now work as laborers.
   German newspapers have reported that as East German enterprises
begin to feel the effects of the free market, they have begun
laying off foreigners before Germans.
   Some foreigners say that although they always have been stared
at or withstood racial comments, the hostility has heightened since
East Germans embraced unification with West Germany.
   ``We feel German unity has led to an upsurge in racism,'' said
Ginga Eichler, an East Berlin activist and rally organizer. ``It
has become a purely German process with no thought given to the
other people who live here.''
   She said East Germans fearing widespread unemployment have
vented their frustrations on dark-skinned foreigners. A hefty loss
of jobs is expected in East Germany as government-created jobs and
obsolete factories are phased out by a free market.
   A group of skinheads shouting neo-Nazi slogans and racial and
anti-homosexual epithets rampaged Friday night through the city's
main square, Alexander Place. At least 10 people were injured in
beatings.
   On Tuesday, the crowd gathered on the square and marched a few
blocks to the stately, red-brick city council building of old
Berlin.
   Speakers from political parties and activist organizations
demanded more protection for foreigners living in East Germany.
Hundreds of foreigners listened, although the largest group in the
crowd was made up of Germans.
   ``Many foreigners are afraid to take part in demonstrations,''
Ms. Eichler said. ``They played very little role in the
revolution.''
   Germany was divided into Communist East and capitalist West
following the 1945 defeat of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime in World
War II. The hard-line Communist regime of Erich Honecker in East
Germany was forced out last October by mass demonstrations, and the
rush toward unification began.
   East Germans were pleased when West Germany said on Monday it
would trade most of the worthless East German marks at a 1-1 rate
for West German marks as the first step of the unification process.
   Although detailed discussions still have to be held, foreigners
fear that they may not be given the same favorable trade on their
East German marks.
   ``I work hard, as hard as anybody, but I will face economic
hardship,'' said Pham Son, 32, a computer engineer sent by the
Communist government in Vietnam to East Germany in 1982.
   He said he has been the target of racial comments from East
German youths. ``Unemployment now is here so there is social
conflict.''
   Ingeburg Kleine, a nurse in a hospital ward for foreigners, said
many are afraid to speak out.
   ``Many speak no German,'' she said as she marched with the
crowd. ``The educated ones have it not so bad. But the workers live
together and must live in small flats.''
   She said clerks in stores sometimes will refuse to sell
particularly scarce items to foreigners, occasionally removing the
items from their baskets when they try to pay.
   Justino Chana, 29, was sent to East Germany from Mozambique in
1981 and has worked in a slaughterhouse since then.
   ``It is very difficult to live here sometimes,'' he said.

<HEAD>Female Infantry Recruits `Ran Out of Gas,' Canadian General Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the 48 young women who tried out for
the Canadian Forces infantry last year ``simply ran out of gas''
and were unable to make it through the grueling training, the
general in charge of the program said Tuesday.
   ``It's not strength; it's a question of stamina and endurance,''
Brig. Gen. Dan Munro told a Pentagon-sponsored conference on
women's issues.
   Only one women graduated from the infantry school, while two
others are still in training, he said.
   ``Most of those young women simply ran out of gas,'' Munro said,
describing the effect of the 10-week basic course, topped by 16
weeks of infantry training that ends with a 10-day drill offering
recruits little sleep amid constant maneuvers.
   But Canada's military _ which was ordered last year to open all
units to women _ has had far more success integrating women into
combat-related jobs in the Navy, Air Force and other Army units
such as artillery or the signal corps, Munro said.
   In 1987, the general said, Canada's defense minister announced
plans to evaluate combat units in which women would serve with men.
Last year, however, Canada's Human Rights Tribunal, acting on
several complaints of discrimination, ordered that the tests be
stopped and that women be integrated into all areas of the nation's
forces except submarines.
   Munro is the director of Canada's Office for the Combat Related
Employment of Women. He spoke to the annual meeting of the Defense
Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, which advises the
Defense Department on issues relating to women and the military.
   The panel is holding its annual conference the week after the
Army announced it had rejected the group's proposal that the
service undertake a four-year study of placing women in all
combat-related fields.
   The recommendation is similar to legislation submitted by Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   By U.S. law, women are barred from serving on combat ships and
planes in the Navy, the Air Force and the Marines, but it is Army
policy that bars women from serving in the combat-related fields
such as infantry, armor and some artillery units.
   Munro told the panel that Canada's female sailors serving on
board destroyers ``are happy and their commanding officers report
satisfaction in their performance. ... The Navy is moving toward a
complete integration of women into the fleet in a positive way and
at a pace faster than ever had been foreseen.''
   The Air Force had moved more swiftly to open more slots to
women, and in the last three years the number of female pilots has
doubled. Now, two women are flying fighter jets, he said.
   The general said that even though no one knows what will happen
in combat, ``we train for war all the time, and we in Canada have
no intention of withdrawing women'' from combat units simply on the
basis of their sex.
   Mistakes were made in the recruiting process when women who
didn't understand the rigors of infantry life were recruited, as
well as women who didn't have the proper physical training, he said.
   There are 86,000 members of the Canadian armed forces and about
10 percent are women, the general said.

   More than two dozen animal rights activists
were arrested Tuesday at the National Institutes of Health during a
demonstration protesting the use of animals in medical research,
authorities said.
   Charges against the 27 people arrested included trespassing,
assault on a police officer and resisting arrest.
   About 300 demonstrators gathered at the NIH campus at midday.
After speeches criticizing institute's role in animal
experimentation, the group marched to the Veterinary Resources
Branch.
   The demonstrators chanted ``Let us in, let them out.''
   NIH security officers formed a line around the building, and
protesters were warned that anyone crossing police lines would be
arrested.

<HEAD>Commission Urges Presidential Involvement In AIDS Response</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Commission on AIDS on Tuesday
called on President Bush to coordinate the federal government's
response to the epidemic and remove restrictions on use of federal
AIDS education and prevention funds.
   The commission also urged support for federal housing aid and
support for legislation that would bar discrimination against
people with AIDS and would pump money into areas hard hit by the
epidemic.
   ``All across the country there is a cry for leadership from the
federal government and partnership between different levels of
government,'' the commission said in its second report to the
president.
   The commission, which also delivered its report to leaders of
Congress, has had nine days of hearings in Washington and Los
Angeles and four working sessions in Boston and St. Paul, Minn.
since it began its work last August.
   Panel members also spent time in New York City, Newark and
Jersey City, N.J., and in rural Georgia, visiting drug treatment
centers, homeless shelters and other places where people with AIDS
can be found, including subway tunnels in New York City.
   ``Nowhere was it more evident that the care of human life must
be a priority for our government than in the streets of New York
City,'' where an estimated 10,000 homeless people may have AIDS or
AIDS-related diseases, the five-page report said.
   But the commission found desperate need for care in California,
as well. In some areas of that state, ``there are six- to
eight-week waits for outpatient services,'' the report said.
   ``Across the country, the commission also heard tales of health
care denied unless it required acute hospitalization,'' the panel
said.
   Commissioners also found that restrictions on the use of federal
education and prevention funds were prolonging the AIDS epidemic.
   Restrictive language in regulations governing use of the funds
was preventing states and communities from putting out effective
messages about such things as use of condoms as a safety precaution
and bleach to clean needles, commissioners said.
   Dr. June Osborn, commission chairwoman, said the federal
government needs some sort of ``flexible and responsive mechanism''
to coordinate the actions of the different federal departments and
agencies that provide services for people with AIDS.
   ``The president can be most helpful in creating such a
coordinating body to provide focus at the top,'' Osborn said.
   The commission urged House support for a Senate-passed bill
titled Americans with Disabilities Act, which would protect people
with AIDS from discrimination, and the panel called on states and
local governments to pass anti-discrimination laws. The
administration also supports the legislation.
   Panel members also urged passage of a measure that would provide
$600 million to areas that have been hardest hit by the AIDS
epidemic, and said more federal funds are needed to provide housing
for people with the disease.
   The commissioners praised Bush for his March 29 speech in which
he said compassion not discrimination was needed in the fight
against AIDS. The panel called it ``important and historic.''
   ``Now the president's commitment needs translation into
action,'' the commission said.
   The 15-member commission includes five people appointed by the
House, five appointed by the Senate and two by the president. The
secretaries of Health and Human Services, Defense and Veterans
Affairs are non-voting members.

<HEAD>2 Salvadorans Cited for Efforts to Promote Peace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Salvadoran human rights workers were
honored on Capitol Hill Tuesday for their efforts in promoting
peace in their war-torn country.
   ``The people, especially the peasants, have suffered,'' Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said at a ceremony at
which Bishop Medardo Gomez and Maria Julia Hernandez received the
Oscar Romero Award.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., said the two were ``willing to
sacrifice in order to preserve the dignity of the individual.''
   The senators made their comments amid growing congressional
efforts to use U.S. financial aid as a way of ending the war
between the U.S.-backed Salvadoran government and leftist rebels.
Some 70,000 people have been killed over the last decade.
   Mitchell said the negotiations now underway between the two
parties offer hope that the war may end soon.
   ``We must persuade ourselves that a military solution is not the
path to protecting peace and establishing democracy,'' said Ms.
Hernandez.
   Hernandez is director of Tutela Legal, the Catholic archbishop's
legal aid office. The group conducts investigations of human rights
in El Salvador.
   Gomez, of the Lutheran Salvadoran Synod, has been a staunch
advocate of peace in his country. In 1983 he was captured and
tortured, but later released. He said he planned to use the award
to create a foundation to keep alive the Christian faith.
   Gomez and Hernandez are recipients of the $10,000 Oscar Romero
Award, sponsored by the Rothko Chapel in Houston, founded by John
and Dominique de Menil.
   Mrs. de Menil, a French-born heiress to the Schlumberger
conglomerate that developed oil drilling, named the Romero awards
after a Roman Catholic archbishop who was murdered in San Salvador
a decade ago.
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, there have been proposals to tie
future U.S. military aid to improvements in the government's human
rights record. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., has proposed, for
instance, withholding an anticipated $90 million in military aid
this fiscal 1990 and using the escrow funds as leverage to
encourage negotiations.
   Some lawmakers are awaiting a report into the slaying of six
Jesuit priests last November. A congressional task force has
investigated the deaths and is expected to release its findings
next week.

<TEXT>
   Deals with Japan and other foreign partners to
absorb cost overruns of the $8 billion superconducting super
collider could kill the project, the chairman of the Senate Energy
Committee warned on Tuesday.
   ``The way to get this thing in political trouble is to give away
the cream of the technology,'' Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
said of the high-energy physics particle accelerator that President
Bush wants to build near Dallas.
   Johnston made the remarks as House leaders postponed until next
week action on a bill that would cap federal spending on what would
be the world's largest and most powerful accelerator at $5 billion
and require foreign partners, Texas or private money to cover any
cost above that level.
   The bill by Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., chairman of the House
Science Committee, is a response to opponents in Congress who claim
the $1 billion a year the government anticipates spending on the
collider when construction gets into full swing will squeeze out
other worthy science endeavors.
   The project essentially involves building two circular
underground tunnels 54 miles around to accelerate beams of protons
in opposite directions at nearly the speed of light and then make
them collide.
   Through the collisions, scientists hope to find previously
unobservable subatomic particles that could provide clues on how
the cosmos was created.
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, in whose district the project would be
located, said that Roe's bill _ over opposition from the Bush
administration _ would limit foreign participation in any aspect of
the project to 50 percent.
   Johnston quoted senior officials in the Energy Department as
telling him, that because of the limit, the administration is
looking at contracting with Japan to supply the 10,000 supermagnets
for the project.
   ``I would hate for us to give away the most valuable thing in
the project, the supermagnets ... and let somebody else develop the
manufacturing technology,'' he said. ``That's what we did with the
auto industry.''
   Meanwhile, northern lawmakers opposed to the project said they
would offer amendments when Roe's bill comes before the House floor
to increase the foreign funding share from 20 percent to 25 percent
and require annual reviews by congressional auditors of spending
and changes in cost estimates.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said the audits would provide an
``objective, independent assessment to back up our claims'' that
the project will be plagued by continuing cost overruns and should
be scuttled.
   ``This is an incremental process,'' Eckart said. ``As a trial
lawyer I know I have to have an arsenal of evidence to refute the
claims of opponents. Clearly last year, they had more evidence than
we had.''
   The administration said Tuesday it would support changes in the
bill to require the successful testing of 10 prototype magnets
before allowing construction of the tunnels to begin.
   In a statement of policy, the White House Budget Office also
said it wants deleted from the bill a provision that would refund
to Texas _ if the project is canceled in the future _ the $1
billion it has pledged toward its costs.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., who as chairman of the Senate Energy
panel's subcommittee on research has backed the project, warned its
supporters against trying to defuse opposition by spreading
contracts for its components around the nation.
   ``If this becomes just another big public works project, you
could be on dangerous ground,'' he said. ``Funding then becomes a
question of how much does your state get and how much does my state
get.''

<HEAD>Britain's Great Train Robber Shot to Death in Spanish Resort</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LON1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARBELLA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of the gang that carried out
Britain's great train robbery of 1963 was shot to death by a young
assailant who fled on a bicycle, police in this seaside resort said
Tuesday.
   Investigators believe the slaying of Charles Wilson, 58, may
have been drug-related, said a Marbella police spokesman who asked
not to be identified.
   A young man in a track suit opened fire Monday afternoon on
Wilson after calling at the door of the Briton's apartment in this
Costa del Sol resort, the spokesman said.
   Neighbors told police they spotted the suspect fleeing on a
yellow bicycle shortly after hearing gunshots coming from Wilson's
apartment, the spokesman said.
   Wilson was pronounced dead on arrival at the Marbella Clinic.
   Another police spokesman in the resort, favored by European
vacationers, said the motive for the shooting was not immediately
clear but that investigators believed it may have been related to
drug trafficking.
   Wilson and 14 other members of a gang took part in what has been
called the ``great train robbery'' on Aug. 8, 1963, when they held
up the Glasgow to London mail train near Aylesbury, 40 miles
northwest of London.
   They stole 2.6 million pounds, then worth $7.2 million. At the
time, it was the biggest robbery in Britain.
   Police recovered less than $966,000, but Wilson and most of the
other gang members were captured and jailed. Wilson was sentenced
to 30 years in prison in 1964 and released in 1978.
   Costa del Sol on Spain's Mediterranean coast has been a haven
for suspected British criminals, but in recent months the Spanish
government has sent a number of suspects back to Britain.
   Wilson had lived in Marbella for several years. He was suspected
of links to gangs that every year smuggle thousands of pounds of
hashish from North Africa through Spain to northern Europe, police
said.

<HEAD>Inspectors General Use Contractors to Look For Waste And Abuse</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 7th graf, In at, to show contractor asked to review
department-wide contracts, not just inspector general's</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The watchdogs charged with policing federal
programs for fraud and abuse often farm out work to private shops,
leaving government oversight of a wide array of contractors in the
hands of fellow contractors.
   The government's inspectors general, in reports to Congress and
in public statements, attribute the hiring of private auditors and
other contractors to severe staff shortages. And they say most of
the outside work is satisfactory.
   But critics inside and outside the government say having private
firms monitor private firms creates a weak link in government
oversight of millions _ if not billions _ of dollars in contracts
for programs ranging from running nuclear plants to job training to
Medicare.
   Documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and from
congressional investigators and other sources, and information from
recent interviews show that a handful of accounting firms led or
heavily staffed by former government auditors get the bulk of the
big-money contracts from the inspectors general.
   A review by the Labor Department's inspector general said that
in most cases it would be cheaper to hire a government worker.
   Most of the government's inspectors general use private firms
working under contract to some degree, and a handful have even used
them to target other contractors for audits or possible prosecution.
   In at least two cases, both at the Department of Energy, a
private firm has been asked to review procurement to determine
whether contracts the department awarded were wasteful or paid
contractors too much.
   ``For the most part the work is good but the standards are not
always being met,'' said a top aide to one inspector general.
``It's clear that having some of these audits was worse than having
no audit at all. It creates an impression of integrity that may not
be there,'' said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Inspectors general were added government-wide in the 1980s, in
part because of congressional efforts to improve oversight as the
Reagan administration pushed to cut government payrolls and have
more work performed by private contractors.
   However, inspectors general also faced staffing limitations,
leading them to turn to private firms to help police the growing
number of private firms involved in government work.
   One firm that does audits for several inspectors general also
has provided three of five lecturers for a course in which
contractors are taught to rebut government audits. The firm,
Leonard G. Birnbaum &amp; Co., recently ended its relationship with the
seminar after congressional investigators brought it to the
attention of the Energy Department.
   Several companies that receive Energy Department funding have
sent employees to past seminars. But a department official said he
did not believe Birnbaum's role posed a possible conflict.
   ``I don't see it has any relationship with anything they do for
us,'' said Gordon Harvey, Energy's assistant inspector general for
audits. ``They must be able to certify under the rules that there
are no conflicts.''
   A recent review by a department panel, however, supported
findings of a Senate subcommittee that several contractors who
certified they had no potential conflicts had also submitted
documents listing work for firms that could pose conflicts.
   In a letter to subcommittee chairman Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark.,
the department said the review panel ``perceives a significant
danger of a contractor being called upon to analyze its own or a
former client's work product.''
   And Energy is the only department to require written disclosure;
other agencies rely on a contractor's word.
   Often, inspectors general use specialized outside help for
detailed chores. The IG at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for example, uses private appraisers to assess the
value of properties involved in larger contract audits. And the
Postal Service's inspector general has hired hypnotists to help
witnesses recall events.
   But several agencies' whose inspectors general rely heavily on
contractors have them perform not only routine audits but also
policy and strategy development, raising the issue of whether the
contracted work is ``inherently governmental.'' General Accounting
Office and Office of Management and Budget guidelines frown on
using contractors for work meeting that standard, but the
definition is interpreted differently within the government.
   The Labor Department inspector general has agreements with 27
contractors and has awarded more than $18 million in contracts in
the past two years, according to records provided to a
congressional subcommittee.
   Among the tasks Labor's IG has assigned contractors were
compiling a target list of contractors for audits and recommending
cases for prosecution under wage and hour laws.
   The Energy Department IG has contracts with a half-dozen private
firms and has spent $17 million on such contracts since January
1988, according to department figures.
   Other agencies whose inspectors general have contracted out more
than $2 million and as much as $8 million in work in the past two
years include the departments of Agriculture, Education, and Health
and Human Services, the Agency for International Development and
the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Some examples of work inspectors general have authorized private
companies to perform:
   _Energy this year asked a contractor to review contracts to
determine if the department was paying contractors too much.
   _Labor hired a private firm to determine if an employee
compensation program was being administered as Congress intended.
Labor's IG also paid a contractor to oversee two other contractors
providing related work.
   _The Justice Department IG hired a contractor for tasks
including legislative research, ``preparation of proposed policies
and procedures'' and developing suggested audit procedures.
   The Energy Department's Harvey, in comments echoed by
representatives of other inspectors general, said the government
auditors review the contractors' reports and that firms staffed
with former government auditors offer vital experience to
short-staffed IG offices.
   ``We do not have enough in-house resources to meet the audit
needs,'' he said.

   The nation's newspaper publishers on Tuesday
watched videotaped interviews with Americans who say they don't
read newspapers very much, then debated how to change that.
   An advertising consultant advised the publishers to adopt a more
local focus, suggesting that international issues such as the push
for independence in Lithuania don't sell advertising.
   A publisher countered that newspapers still reach a larger
audience than any other news medium.
   The comments were made during a panel discussion at the American
Newspaper Publishers Association 104th annual convention. The
discussion, moderated by Jeff Greenfield of ABC News, was called
``Ozzie and Harriet Are Gone _ Who Do You Think You're Writing
For?''
   Virginia Dodge Fielder, vice president of research for
Knight-Ridder Inc., expressed industry frustration in trying to
pinpoint the cause of declining readership.
   ``I wish people hated us more,'' she said. ``I wish they
expressed more dissatisfaction because if they did we'd know how to
tackle it. ... What the public is saying is not `I hate you' but `I
don't need you. You're a great electric company, but I live in an
all-gas house.'''
   The session opened with videotaped interviews in which subjects
were asked if they read a newspaper.
   ``I don't have time,'' was a common response. Several said that
TV news was ``easier.'' One man said he felt less connected to his
local newspaper since big business had taken it over. The comment
echoed a message emphasized by Laurel Cutler, vice chairman of
FCB-Leber Katz partners and vice president of consumer affairs for
the Chrysler Corp.
   ``The only specialized thing about a newspaper is its
locality,'' she told the audience. Localness is what you have to
sell. That's why USA Today is a very peculiar animal. I guess it's
the local newspaper for people on airlines.''
   Frank A. Daniels Jr., president and publisher of The News &amp;
Observer of Raleigh, N.C., interjected that ``a newspaper
traditionally has been a smorgasbord. You have something in there
for everybody.''
   But Ms. Cutler warned against newspapers trying to be ``all
things to all people'' and suggested specialization was more
appealing to advertisers.
   ``The more generalized, the more all things to all people, the
less we care about you,'' she said.
   Daniels suggested that newspapers might have to follow the lead
of American Express, which created different categories of cards
for different income brackets. He noted that a newspaper
subscription is costly and perhaps different price brackets for
different incomes would encourage more readership.
   ``How do we create a platinum card newspaper?'' he asked.
   Greenfield suggested that the puzzle of declining readership may
not be complex.
   ``Is it possible that the reason people read newspapers so
devotedly in 1940 is there was nothing else to inform them?'' he
asked. ``And maybe this age of newspapers is like the buggy whip
manufacturers in 1910.''
   Publishers and editors on the panel disagreed.
   ``One thing you may be overlooking is how adaptable newspapers
are,'' said C. Shelby Coffey III, editor and executive vice
president of the Los Angeles Times.
   He noted that the Times has numerous regional bureaus to keep
the paper local but has inaugurated a new ``World Report'' section
to emphasize global developments.
   ``Research at the Times shows that international news is of
great interest to readers,'' he said.
   Coffey and Gerald Garcia, editor and publisher of The Knoxville
(Tenn.) Journal, also urged development of a multi-ethnic reporting
force to keep up with interests of a diverse reading audience.
Coffey called it ``the polycultural newsroom.''
   Consultant Ronald Brown, president of Banks, Brown Inc. of San
Francisco, noted that the interests of that city's Chinese-Americn
population are underrepresented in its newspapers
   All panelists agreed that improved education would improve
readership of newspapers.

<HEAD>Head Start Officials Say Their Teachers Need More Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beginning Head Start teachers are paid so
little that they could qualify for Medicaid and other welfare
programs while working an average of 1,311 hours a year, officials
of the pre-school program said Tuesday.
   Ron Herndon of Portland, Ore., president of National Head Start
Director's Association, said Head Start's ``greatest debt is to the
dedicated staff, primarily women, who have endured nearly poverty
wages to help others escape poverty.''
   He said the program's success could not continue at the expense
of its staff.
   The administration has proposed a $1.9 billion budget for Head
Start.
   That includes a $500 million spending increase to allow
enrollment to grow to 667,000 children, or 70 percent of those
eligible. The program now enrolls between 20 percent and 39 percent
of the eligible children _ depending on the statistics used.
   Herndon said a 1988 federal study found that 47 percent of Head
Start teachers earned $10,000 per year or less.
   The overall average salary of a Head Start teacher in 1988 was
$12,074 per year; with a bachelor's degree, the average Head Start
teacher earned $15,043.
   To be eligible for Head Start's comprehensive services _ which
include breakfast and lunch, and medical and dental check-ups _ the
family income of 3-5-year-olds must be $12,100. The Medicaid
eligibility of a family of four is $16,093.
   Herndon said the turnover rate for the program is between 17
percent and 20 percent. Board member Sarah Greene of Bradenton,
Fla., said low pay is the reason 95 percent of the staff quit.
   ``We're saying (the administration's position) is
shortsighted,'' Herndon said.

<HEAD>New Method Developed To Make Digestible Milk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have developed a more efficient way
of breaking down a sugar in milk that can't be digested by many
adult Americans, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   An enzyme in the human body normally breaks down milk sugar _
lactose _ in dairy products, but blacks, Asians and American
Indians tend to have a low level of this enzyme, said George
Somkuti of the department's Agricultural Research Service.
   One solution is to add something to dairy products that does the
work of the human body's natural enzyme.
   Somkuti said researchers have developed a new source of the
enzyme that is ``better than those now being used as additives
because of its food-grade nature.''
   The new source is an altered form of an organism, Streptococcus
thermophilus, which produces an enzyme that breaks down lactose in
dairy products, he said. The Food and Drug Administration has
approved S. thermophilus as a natural agent for making products
such as cheese and yogurt.
   Somkuti said the altered bacterium's benefit is that it won't
grow when added to milk. However, it splits lactose into two simple
sugars, glucose and galactose, he said.
   The new technique, which is being patented by the USDA agency,
could help people with lactose intolerance enjoy dairy products and
thereby boost sales by milk producers, officials said.
   Somkuti works at the USDA agency's eastern regional research
center in Philadelphia, Pa. The announcement was issued in
Washington by the agency.

<HEAD>EPA Considering Mandatory Recycling For CFSs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is
considering whether to impose a mandatory recycling requirement for
major users of chloroflourocarbons, or CFCs, the agency said
Tuesday.
   The chemical, which is widely used as a refrigerant and as an
industrial solvent, is a principal cause of stratospheric ozone
depletion and will be phased out over the coming decade in many
countries including the United States.
   But the EPA said it was considering regulatory action aimed at
getting users to recycle the chemical, instead of letting it
routinely into the air during maintenance and installation.
   Such releases have been common when mechanics work on automobile
air conditioners or during repairs or installation of commercial or
home air conditioners.
   The EPA said among the proposals that it was considering for
possible rulemaking is a mandatory CFC recycling program that would
be imposed on major users of the chemical nationwide. Another
option would be a deposit-refund system where users of CFCs would
return cannisters of the chemical for a refund instead of venting
the chemical, the agency said.
   Many CFC users already have announced plans to shift to CFC
recycling programs. Several of the major automakers, for example,
have said within the next year they plan to provide dealers with
equipment that would recycle CFCs used in automobile air
conditioners.
   The commercial air conditioning industry also has said it is
developing recycling programs for the chemical.

<TEXT>
   Maestro Kurt Masur, a hero of East Germany's
revolution, visited the New York Philharmonic on Tuesday for the
first time since being named music director of the
``conductor-killing'' ensemble.
   His five-year contract was announced two weeks ago. It starts in
the fall of 1992.
   ``I don't hear the word `hero' very much,'' the 62-year-old
music director of the Gewandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig told
reporters. ``I did my deal only to avoid confrontation that brings
blood to our streets in Leipzig. We were lucky that everybody felt
it shouldn't be a confrontation and it didn't happen.''
   Masur held meetings between East German police and people
pressing for change. After those meetings, talks were held and
bloodshed avoided. Some said that only Masur's international
standing as conductor of the Gewandhaus made the meetings possible.
   Masur said he would remain involved in the politics of Leipzig.
   But his main concern, Masur said, is the Gewandhaus Orchestra,
which he will lead through the 1993-94 season. East Germany,
smaller than Massachusetts, has 91 professional orchestras, all
state-supported before the revolution.
   ``The opening of the Wall brings lots of very positive points,''
he said. ``At the moment everybody is a little bit frightened. I
don't think it will be very easy to keep it all going. I believe
that money from the government will be given but it will not be
enough.''
   He said that when he first conducted the New York Philharmonic,
in 1981, he'd heard its reputation as a ``conductor killer.''
   ``After a while I discovered they are wonderful human beings,''
he said.
   As for changes he intends at the Philharmonic, Masur mentioned
closer cooperation with the Juilliard School, which is next door in
Lincoln Center. He also wants to start a children's choir, organize
longer rehearsals for difficult works and shorter for familiar ones.
   ``I'm not one of those who is promising everything before the
election and then not doing it later,'' Masur said. ``I only can
promise you one thing; I will do this as honest as I did everything
in my life.''
   Asked how he feels about the Philharmonic engaging him instead
of an American, Masur said that he has helped many young American
conductors who were attempting to establish reputations in Europe.
``This question comes to my heart. My successor should be American
born.''

   The House approved the non-binding resolution 417-0. It includes
a request that President Bush consider human rights abuses before

   Liberian President Samuel Doe launched a crackdown on his
opponents after a group of insurgents killed several Liberian

fled to the neighboring Ivory Coast and Guinea.

   Jewish settlers Tuesday accused the State
Department of interfering in their efforts to retain control of a
housing complex in the Christian quarter of Jerusalem's Old City.
   ``We're disappointed with the interference of the State
Department in something which is both an internal Israeli matter
and is also under judicial discussion,'' said Rabbi Jonathan Blass,
a spokesman for the Neot David settlement.
   His statement came a day after State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler called the settlers' move into the Christian area
``an insensitive and provocative action.''
   She also said the Israeli government's funding of the settlement
``is deeply disturbing.''
   The Israeli Housing Ministry acknowledged last weekend that it
put up $1.8 million toward the purchase of Neot David's lease.
   The movement of the 150 Jews into the complex near the venerated
Church of the Holy Sepulcher on April 11 set off demonstrations by
Christian clerics and Palestinians.
   The four-building complex is owned by the Greek Orthodox Church,
which took the settlers to court and won an eviction order. The
settlers have appealed, and a hearing is scheduled Thursday before
the Supreme Court.
   The U.S. complaint about Neot David was relayed to Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir by U.S. Ambassador William Brown in a
meeting Monday.
   The United States opposes the establishment of settlements on
Israeli-occupied land, saying it is an obstacle to peace.
   Shamir later said the government gave the settlers funding as
part of a general government housing program.
   ``The case at hand is one of an ordinary commercial real estate
transaction,'' Shamir said in a statement.
   The government, he said, ``does not assist and would even have
prevented any action constituting an affront to places sacred to
(any of) the religions or holy sites.''
   But he also added that ``every Jew has the right to live in
Jerusalem.''
   Israel captured the Old City from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
war and annexed it. Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip in
the same war and continues to occupy the territories, home to 1.7
million Palestinians. More than 140 Jewish settlements have been
built in the occupied lands.
   In the West Bank on Tuesday, a Jewish settlement leader suffered
a head cut when he was stoned by Palestinians youths.
   The victim, Rabbi Moshe Levinger, said stones were thrown at him
near the Beit Romano settler enclave in the heart of Hebron. He
said he put his hand on his gun and the stone-throwers fled.
   ``I did not fire because I didn't see exactly who threw the
stones,'' Levinger said.
   Levinger currently is on trial for manslaughter for allegedly
shooting to death an Arab shoe salesman after he was stoned in
Hebron on Sept. 30, 1988.
   Also Tuesday, eight masked Palestinians armed with axes and
knives stabbed a Gaza Strip taxi driver to death, Arab reports
said. They said the victim was suspected of collaborating with
Israel.
   He was identified as Nabil Mohammed Aloush, 35, of the Jabaliya
refugee camp.
   His death raised to 209 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs in the 28-month-old uprising against Israeli rule.
Most were suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   In addition, 676 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers or civilians, and 43 Israelis have died in the violence.

<HEAD>Cuba Extends Jamming of Radio Marti Past Sunrise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba began jamming the U.S. government's Radio
Marti broadcasts between 6 a.m. and noon on Tuesday, said a
spokeswoman for the Voice of America, which runs the service.
   VOA spokeswoman Beth Knisley said the agency deplores the action
taken against Radio Marti, which began broadcasting five years ago.
The jamming denies the Cuban people ``access to uncensored news and
information,'' she said.
   She quoted a Cuban government statement as saying that the
jamming was a ``new step toward a definitive solution of the
problem.'' She said the broadcast operation can still be heard on
shortwave radios.
   Until this month, Cuba had not interfered with Radio Marti
except for a humming sound that impaired the quality of the
broadcasts.
   Cuba started jamming the station during the pre-dawn hours last
week and then shifted the interference on Tuesday to the
post-sunrise period when the audience is much greater.
   The actions appear to be related to the advent of TV Marti, the
televised version of Radio Marti. TV Marti tests began last month
during the early morning hours and have been jammed consistently by
Cuban transmitters.
   There have been some reports, however, that TV Marti has been
seen in most of the island's 14 provinces.
   At a news conference three weeks ago, President Fidel Castro
suggested that the TV Marti tests could provoke a crackdown on
Radio Marti.
   Castro said it is unacceptable for the United States to transmit
radio programming unilaterally to Cuba. One possible solution, he
said, is for the two countries to reach an agreement governing
mutual broadcast rights.
   The United States has defended both Radio and TV Marti on
grounds that the Cuban people have not had access to objective news
since Castro assumed power 31 years ago.
   Castro has called TV Marti a ``gross instrument of subversion''
that violates national sovereignty and international law. The Bush
administration has said the station is consistent with
international law.

   Federal immigration authorities said Tuesday
they plan to launch a pilot program to allow the release of 200
refugees who have been detained while seeking political asylum in
the United States.
   Under the program expected to be announced this week, some
refugees detained in Miami, New York City, Los Angeles and San
Francisco would be released on bond if they meet certain
qualifications.
   The program is expected to be formally announced by Immigration
Commissioner Gene McNary after discussions with the Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights, a New York-based group that advocates
improved treatment of refugees.
   Arthur Helton, head of the organization's refugee project, said
the pilot program would affect 200 of the more than 500 refugees
detained because they arrived at the U.S. border without a passport
or visa.
   These refugees, many from Haiti, Sri Lanka, Iran, Afghanistan
and Somalia, often languish in detention centers for years while
their applications for asylum are processed, he said.
   Those released would be required to post bonds between $500 and
$2,500 and agree to report monthly to INS offices, Helton said.
   INS spokesman Verne Jervis confirmed that the agency is putting
the final touches on the program.
   He said INS agreed to the pilot program ``to see if we can
release these people under certain conditions so we won't have to
keep so many people in detention at our expense and their
unhappiness.''
   If the program proves successful, Helton said his organization
would ask the INS to revise its automatic-detention regulations for
refugees in the category.

   Eleven lawmakers asked the Pentagon on Tuesday
to reinstate Craig Fields as head of the Defense Department's
high-technology research and development agency.
   ``Firing and silencing such a key player in the U.S.
competitiveness debate is at best short-sighted, at worst a major
breach of our future economic security,'' the bipartisan group said
in a letter to Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood.
   Fields had been head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency for a year until he was transferred Friday. The agency,
DARPA, provides money to private industry to develop
high-technology goods with military uses.
   Supporters of Fields contend he was removed because he advocated
spending money on so-called ``dual-use'' technologies _ technology
that has civilian as well as military applications.
   The agency has a $1.2 billion budget, about half of which goes
to dual-use technologies, said Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., at a news
conference to announce the drive to reinstate Fields.
   DARPA-funded projects include super computers, artificial
intelligence, software, semiconductor manufacturing technology and
biotechnology. Levine, whose home state is a high-technology
center, is co-chairman of the Congressional High-Technology Caucus.
   Levine is also chairman of Rebuild America, a public-policy
group that promotes high-technology industries. Levine said he is
drafting legislation that would put DARPA under control of the
Commerce Department and require that funds be spent only on
dual-use technology except in special cases.
   Although DARPA is in the Pentagon, it is one of the few
government programs developing civilian technologies.
   The administration is divided over the role of government in
helping private industry. Conservatives arge that such funding
would interfere with the free market place and that private
industry should fund such research.
   Among those disagreeing with that conservative stance are Sen.
John Heinz, R-Pa., who signed the letter.
   ``Other countries are engaged in national economic strategies to
advance their own commercial interests through government
cooperation and financial support on the technological level,''
said Heinz. ``DARPA is the only strategy that we have in the entire
federal government.
   ``Why am I here as a Republican? Because I do not want George
Bush to go down in history as the president who presided over the
economic decline of the United States of America because he and
members of his administration were blind.''
   Another Republican who signed the letter and helping lead the
drive to reinstate Fields is Rep. Don Ritter of Pennsylvania, who
is chairman of the congressional Technology and Policy Task Force
as well as ranking member of the commerce and competitiveness
subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Other signers are House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.;
Reps. Les AuCoin, D-Ore.; Norman Mineta, D-Calif.; Edward Markey,
D-Mass.; Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass.; Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, and
Helen D. Bentley, R-Md.; and Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.,
chairman of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on science, technology
and space.
   At the Pentagon, a statement was released saying that Victor
Reis, the deputy director of DARPA, has been named acting director
pending the appointment of a new director.
   The statement also said that Fields would begin serving in his
new post on May 6, in which he is responsible for ``evaluating and
recommending actions to streamline the large and complex research
and development laboratory infrastructure'' of the Defense
Department.

<HEAD>Presidential Aide Who Was Slain in Nigerian Coup Attempt Buried</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ibrahim Babangida's personal
aide was buried with full military honors Tuesday, two days after
he was killed by rebels during a coup attempt.
   Babangida narrowly escaped death when insurgents opened fire on
his residence, killing his top aide, Lt. Col. Usman Bello. Bello
was buried Tuesday in his native state of Niger in central Nigeria.
   More than 150 soldiers and 177 civilians have been arrested for
participating in the uprising against Babangida and his military
government, which came to power in a bloodless coup in August 1987.
   On Monday, an army spokesman described the fighting as the
heaviest in any attempt to overthrow Nigeria's government.
Officials have yet so divulge any casualty figures.
   Dozens of people died in coups in 1966 that triggered ethnic
violence in which thousands more died and ultimately caused the
crippling Biafran war.
   The rebellious soldiers who joined the latest coup attempt
captured the national radio station at one point and said they
wanted to overthrow Babangida to end the traditional domination of
the country by Moslems from the north. The southern states are
mainly Christian and animist.
   In a message broadcast Tuesday to mark the end of the Moslem
fast month of Ramadan, Babangida said, ``Nigerians have cause to be
grateful to God that the coup failed because the unity of the
nation would have been wiped out if the coup had succeeded.''
   More than 600,000 people died in the 1967-70 Biafran war, an
effort by easterners to secede from the federation. The easterners,
mostly Christian or followers of traditional African religions,
also alleged that northerners were dominating the nation.

   More thunderstorms developed over the central part of the nation
Tuesday after a night of severe storms, and deep snow headed for
the mountains of Colorado and Wyoming.
   Thunderstorms developed along a cold front mainly over South
Dakota during the afternoon. A severe thunderstorm watch was issued
for parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin.
   Showers were widely scattered from southeastern Kansas to
northeastern Texas, and from the upper Great Lakes to the central
high Plains.
   Thunderstorms over Minnesota during the morning produced hail an
inch in diameter at Royalton, about 20 miles north of St. Cloud.
   From late Monday into early Tuesday, thunderstorms produced
severe weather in the southern Plains with 36 reports of severe
weather in western Texas and western Oklahoma, the National Weather
Service said.
   Thunderstorms spawned three tornadoes in Texas, and large hail
was reported, the weather service said.
   Overnight thunderstorms also produced very heavy rain in extreme
southeastern Minnesota. Many areas received more than 2 inches of
rain in 24 hours, with 3 to 6 inches reported around Austin and
Rochester.
   Snow was expected to develop Tuesday and into Wednesday morning
over some of the higher elevations of Colorado and Wyoming.
   As much as 5 to 10 inches of snow was expected in Wyoming's Big
Horn, Absaroka and Wind River mountains.
   The snow level in Colorado was expected to drop to 7,000 feet
during the night, with up to 6 inches of snow possible at higher
elevations.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms spread over the southern
tip of Florida.
   Showers associated with a cold front were scattered from Arizona
to southern Idaho, with snow showers in the mountains of Arizona
that left an inch on the ground at Flagstaff.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 24 at Houlton, Maine.

   Fifteen Maoist guerrillas were slain by police
in fighting outside the jungle town of Mazamari, in the tropical
lowlands 200 miles east of Lima, the Interior Ministry said.
   Police suffered no casualties in the fighting Monday night, the
ministry said, but 20 others in the Shining Path rebel column
escaped into the jungle.
   Shotguns, an assault rifle and pistols belonging to the rebels
were confiscated, along with dynamite and propaganda from the
Maoist-inspired radical group, the ministry said.
   The government Tuesday extended for 60 days the state of
emergency in eight Peruvian departments, covering more than half of
Peru's 24 million residents. The emergency decree allows police and
military to detain suspects and search homes without warrant.
   Since the Shining Path took up arms in 1980 against the
government, more than 18,000 people have died in political
violence, the government says.

   The coming of high definition television won't
reduce demand for American movies and television programs overseas,
a report to Congress said Tuesday.
   The General Accounting Office said, however, that a single
standard for over-the-air transmission was necesssary to make U.S.
broadcasters and television manufacturers competitive with Japanese
and European satellite transmission of the new technology.
   High definition television or HDTV offers a wider and sharper
television picture than traditional television by increasing the
number of horizontal lines that make up the picture.
   Television systems worldwide use different production formats
and transmission standards because efforts to agree on a standard
have been unsuccessful. Similarly, there has been no agreement on
standards for high definition television.
   International broadcasters met last year but declined to adopt
the standard developed by the Japanese _ the so-called 1,125-60
standard, 1,125 lines per picture renewed 60 times per second.
Current U.S. television pictures use 525 lines per picture renewed
30 times per second.
   ``The absence of such a standard will not negatively affect the
U.S. entertainment industry's ability to successfully market its
movies and television programs,'' said the GAO, the congressional
investigative arm.
   The GAO said representatives of the U.S. entertainment industry
were confident there would be no impact on international marketing
``because they sell their programs primarily on content rather than
picture quality.''
   The U.S. industry, the largest producer worldwide of theater and
television programs, is likely to continue to produce movies and
television programs using 35mm film, the report said.
   ``According to motion picture and television industry officials,
film is the highest quality production format currently available
with about 2,000 lines of resolution. As a result, it converts well
to all current television standards, and according to motion
picture industry officials, will also convert well to HDTV
standards,'' the report said.
   However an over-the-air transmission standard ``is needed to
allow U.S. broadcasters and television manunfacturers the
opportunity to participate in HDTV,'' GAO found.
   The lack of a transmission standard ``could be a competitive
disadvantage with cable and satellite companies'' for American
broadcasters who are constrained by regulatory and technical
limitations of over-the-air transmission, the report said.
   U.S. exports of movie and television programs now contribute
about $1 billion a year to the nation's balance of payments.

   A team from the Soviet Union will visit F.E.
Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming this week to observe a
demonstration designed to help expedite the START arms control
negotiations, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday.
   The observer team will view procedures for on-site verification
of the number of re-entry vehicles on an intercontinental ballistic
missile, the statement said.
   ``This demonstration is designed to facilitate and expedite
agreement in the on-going Strategic Arms Reduction Talks on
procedures to verify the number of warheads loaded on strategic
ballistic missiles on both sides,'' the statement said.
   The demonstration Wednesday and Thursday is a result of
President Bush's call in June for cooperative efforts to facilitate
a START agreement and the U.S.-Soviet agreement of Jan. 22 to
commit both nations to such demonstrations, the statement said.
   F.E. Warren Air Force Base has the 10-warhead MX missile. The
Pentagon statement did not say what missile would be used in the
demonstration.

   The Kremlin reinforced KGB border guards in
Lithuania on Tuesday, and Lithuania's president accused the United
States of selling out his rebellious Baltic republic in its
confrontation with the Soviet government.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported a gunfire attack Monday
night on a Soviet army barracks in Vilnius, Lithuania's capital,
but said no one was hurt.
   President Bush said in Washington he will not impose sanctions
on the Soviet Union at this time over its crackdown on Lithuania.
He said he feared sanctions might prompt Moscow ``to take action
that would set back the whole case of freedom around the world.''
   The Soviets have cut off oil, drastically curtailed natural gas
and curbed other supplies to Lithuania in trying to force the
republic to halt its six-week-old drive for independence.
   Earlier, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev
warned that U.S. sanctions could have ``negative consequences.''
   Perfiliev did not state directly that the Soviet Union might
retaliate but said ``any actions taken which could pull apart the
sides of the argument of course could have negative consequences,
not only for the Soviet Union but for the international situation.''
   After Bush's announcement, President Vytautas Landsbergis of
Lithuania issued an angry statement from Vilnius.
   ``Can the freedom of one group of people be sold for the freedom
of another? What then is the idea of freedom itself?'' he said.
   ``This is another Munich.''
   He was referring to the 1938 Munich Pact, in which France and
Britain allowed Nazi Germany to take control of Czechoslovakia. The
treaty was widely viewed as caving in to Adolf Hitler. The pact
became a symbol of appeasement.
   Tass and Soviet TV's nightly newscast reported Bush's
announcement.
   Tass also quoted Soviet army Maj. Alexei Kirichenko as saying a
shot was fired at an open window at about 10 p.m. when soldiers
were already inside the barracks. It said the bullet smashed a
window on the opposite wall, and that ballistics experts believe a
combat weapon, and not a hunting rifle was used.
   The agency also reported from Vilnius that the Lithuanian
parliament on Tuesday set up a commission to ``prepare
anti-blockade measures'' and named Prime Minister Kazimiera
Prunskiene as commission chief.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's advisers refused on Tuesday to
receive a five-member Lithuanian delegation sent to Moscow to
discuss the plight of the republic after a week of enduring the
Kremlin economic blockade.
   Lithuania hopes to make up for some of the supplies Moscow has
cut with imports from abroad. But the KGB's announcement that it
was adding personnel and equipment to guard the republic's border
appeared designed as a warning against such a step.
   Lt. Anatoly Parakhin of the KGB, whose forces are responsible
for Soviet borders, did not specify in a Moscow briefing what the
secret police were looking for, but indicated weapons were on the
list.
   ``Control has been established over possible contacts between
Soviet and foreign ships in territorial waters and within the
borders of the economic zone of the U.S.S.R. to avert the transfer
of weapons and ammunition to Lithuania,'' Tass quoted Parakhin as
saying.
   ``The movement through the border of all cargo and means of
transportation is being most carefully controlled.
   ``All coastal fishing ships, without exception, are being
inspected by border details.''
   He said the stepped-up control was justified by an April 12
incident in which 240,000 rounds of hunting ammunition were found
aboard the Soviet ship Marat Kozlov, Tass said. It was sailing to
Lithuania from West Germany.
   The increased border patrols were in line with a March 21
Kremlin statement calling for increased security on the Lithuanian
section of the Soviet border.
   Moscow began tightening its economic vise last week after
Lithuania refused to rescind laws bolstering its March 11
declaration of independence.
   Mrs. Prunskiene returned to Moscow from Scandinavia on Monday on
a trip to seek foreign support, especially oil.
   V. Mosolov, an official of the State Supplies Committee in
Moscow, told the news agency that railroad tanker cars needed to
transport imported oil in Lithuania belong to the Soviet Railways
Ministry, and not the republic. He seemed to imply the republic
would not be allowed to use ministry facilities.

<TEXT>
   Black factional fighting last
year was the worst in modern times and 4,000 people could die by
year's end if violence continues at its present level, an official
reported on Tuesday.
   An increase also was reported in white right-wing violence.
White supremacist groups oppose government moves toward sharing
power with the disenfranchised 28 million black majority.
   On Tuesday, the government banned all police from belonging to
any political party. The Conservative Party and white right-wing
groups claim wide support among the security forces.
   Conservative Party members objected to the ruling, which was
announced in Parliament by Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok.
   Vlok announced a pay raise for police on Monday. Hundreds of
police resigned after the government legalized the African National
Congress this year and began allowing marches and political
protests by blacks.
   John Kane-Berman, executive director of the independent South
African Institute of Race Relations said Tuesday black factional
fighting was going on in all four provinces.
   He said that in 1989, black factional fighting killed 1,403
people, with more than 90 percent of the death occurring in Natal
province.
   Supporters of the African National Congress and its allied
organizations are in conflict there with the Inkatha party headed
by Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   Deaths in the first quarter of 1990 ranged from 574 _ the
official total _ to 966, a figure based on information from groups
monitoring Natal violence.
   Vlok told Parliament police can either resign their jobs or
resign membership in political parties, movements or organizations,
including the governing National Party.
   ``You can't belong to a political party and be a policeman. It's
as simple as that,'' said Vlok. He said police would continue to
watch and note the activities of political parties as part of their
duties.
   Vlok also announced that a black man identified as a ``trained
terrorist'' apparently attached to the ANC was arrested Sunday in
connection with the April 15 murder of a white policeman in Natal
province.
   Vlok said police also seized 18 mini-limpet mines, 17 hand
grenades, two AK-47 assault rifles and ammunition.
   Government officials said last week they were concerned about
reports that the ANC's military wing, Spear of the Nation, had
begun openly recruiting in black townships.
   ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela called Sunday for
intensified ``armed struggle'' against the white government, and
said recent police shootings of black protesters showed the ANC's
guerrilla fighters were still needed.
   In its daily unrest report Tuesday, police said over the
previous 24 hours a black woman was ki8lled when set afire by a mob
and the body of a black man was found after black political
fighting in Natal province.
   Security police detained 10 alleged dissident ANC members when
they arrived on an Air Malawi airplane from Tanzania on Tuesday,
government-run radio said.
   Police suspected one member of the group, Mwezi Twala, was a
former ANC military commander who was tortured by the ANC after
leading a rebellion in Angola in 1984.

<HEAD>European Leader Sees Hope for Accord on Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jacques Delors of the European
Commission said Tuesday he hoped to reach an agreement with the
United States by the end of July on the long-disputed issue of
subsidies to farmers.
   The commission is the joint executive of the 12 countries in the
European Common Market, which has taken the position that it is
unrealistic to talk about ending subsidies.
   President Bush has adopted the position of the Reagan
administration that subsidies should be phased out by the year 2000.
   Europe and the United States both spend billions on these
subsidies every year.
   ``If we leave on the side the war over principle, it's possible
in a pragmatic approach to find a solution which reduces on both
sides the amoount of subsidy to agriculture _ but all the
subsidies, not only the subvention to export but also deficiency
payments,'' Delors told reporters as he left the White House after
meeting President Bush.
   ``We have taken the decision to have bilateral discussions and
to find a solution, I hope before the end of July.''
   ``Deficiency payments'' are direct payments to raise the incomes
of poor farmers. The more usual subsidies to farmers take the form
of government help to keep up the level of prices for farm
products. U.S. and European authorities compete for sales in other
areas by subsidizing exports as well.
   The dispute over farm subsidies is one of the major issues in
the Uruguay round of trade negotiations, in which about 100
countries are taking part under the sponsorship of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
   Some progress was made at a meeting of cabinet ministers from 29
countries last week at Puerto Valarta, Mexico. Afterwards Jules
Katz, the deputy U.S. Trade Representative, said they agreed to
deal with access to markets and price supports as well as with
export subsidies.
   After the Bush-Delors meeting, Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said ina statement: ``The president reiterated to Commission
President Delors that the United States is firmly committed to
improving the multilateral trading system and strengthening the
GATT through agreements reached during the Uruguay Round GATT
negotiations scheduled to conlcude in Brussels next December, and
that the cooperation of the (Common Market) is essential,
particularly in the agricultural area.''

<HEAD>French Commandos Hold Mock Raids on Nuclear Plants, Newspaper
Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commandos of the French secret service twice broke
into nuclear power plants in 1987, in one case leaving behind two
fake bombs as proof of lax security, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Le Canard Enchaine, a satirical weekly known for its
investigative reporting, ran a photocopy of a letter apparently
written by the state power company's security chief, reporting to
his superior about the second raid.
   According to the letter, two secret service agents carried out
an undetected mock sabotage raid in October 1987 on the nuclear
plant at Bugey, near Lyon. They climbed over an electrified fence,
placed two dummy bombs inside a cooling tower, then set up a rocket
launcher outside, the letter said.
   The other raid was conducted in March 1987 on the nuclear plant
at Nogent-sur-Seine, near Paris, with agents gaining access to the
control room, the newspaper said.
   The paper also published a photocopy of a letter _ apparently
from an Interior Ministry official _ informing officials in charge
of the nuclear industry that a former member of the Red Brigades,
the Italian terrorist group, had been employed as a cleaner at a
French nuclear plant.
   There was no immediate official response to the weekly's report.
   Last week, after Le Canard Enchaine published a less detailed
article on the same subject, electric company official Lucien
Bertron said a test raid was conducted at Bugey in 1985-86 and
described other parts of the report as ``pure fantasy.''

Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man accused of setting a booby trap that killed
a burglary suspect in a crime-plagued warehouse is getting plenty
of sympathy from a public fed up with crime, supporters said
Tuesday.
   ``I think we are getting demoralized here, and generally losing
control of our community,'' said T.J. Scranton, a one-time
schoolteacher. ``We've reached a place where the police can't
handle it.''
   Scranton is one of more than 100 people who have voiced support
for handyman Philip Connaghan through letters to newspapers and
calls to radio talk shows. Connaghan is accused in the April 14
death of Michael McComb, 19, who was killed by a blast from a
12-gauge shotgun propped inside a warehouse.
   Connaghan, 46, of suburban Arvada, was released Monday on $5,000
bond after he was arrested for investigation of first-degree
murder. Denver District Attorney Norm Early has said he will decide
by Thursday whether to file charges.
   Connaghan has denied knowledge of the booby trap, which is
illegal under city ordinances.
   The warehouse has been burglarized eight times since 1987. Each
time, the burglars have targeted Connaghan's valuable shop tools.
The warehouse also has housed vehicle parts, pickup camper shells
and acetylene torches.
   Last July, Connaghan told police he lost more than $7,000 in
tools during a burglary.
   The case has triggered overwhelming public support for Connaghan
among residents who are ``fed up with crime,'' said Kris Olinger,
news director at KOA-AM radio, an all-talk and news station.
   ``They can empathize with what Phillip Connaghan is going
through in terms of being burglarized,'' she said.
   By a 9-1 margin, callers are saying Connaghan should not be
charged, Olinger said.
   In addition, the station has aired comments from an undetermined
number of callers who said ``he should be able to protect his
business and livelihood, and especially if he couldn't get any help
from the police,'' she said.
   On Sunday, letters to the editor in Denver's two newspapers were
primarily in favor of property protection. A dozen letters appeared
in both papers with only one opposing the use of booby traps.
   One reader wrote `It seems that Michael McComb got a taste of
old-fashioned American justice.''
   Among those who are opposed to booby traps and threatening
property protection devices are public safety officials who might
have to break into buildings to assist in emergencies.
   ``I am confident that the emotions of the community would be
very different if a fireman or policeman had been killed by a booby
trap while performing his duties,'' one writer to a newspaper said.
   Connaghan's case hit close to home for Scranton, 46, a music
teacher whose Denver home was damaged by a fire set by burglars.
   Scranton has taken his frustration one step further, by
proposing a revision in Colorado's so-called ``Make My Day'' law to
include property protection.
   The law, nicknamed after a line from a Clint Eastwood movie,
allows homeowners to use deadly force to defend themselves in
life-threatening situations.
   Scranton said he is starting a petition drive to change the law
to allow homeowners to set up what he calls ``life-threatening
security devices'' to protect property.

<HEAD>United Airlines Flight Attendants Ratify Contract Tied To Employee
Buyout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The union representing 14,000 United Airlines
flight attendants ratified a new contract Tuesday that is dependent
upon success of a $4.38 billion employee buyout of the airline, the
union announced.
   The ratification vote by mail ballot is one of the steps
required before the employee buyout is completed.
   The United takeover, announced earlier this month, calls for
71,000 employees to give $2 billion in concessions over five years.
Flight attendants, pilots and Machinist union members all are
involved in the deal which has not yet received financing.
   Contracts with the Air Line Pilots Association and the
International Association of Machinists have yet to be ratified.
   The employee stock ownership plan is to include allocated shares
for each flight attendant after one year of service, and a union
representative on the United Airlines Board of Directors, the union
said.
   The contract eliminates a program designed to prevent flight
attendants from being overweight, according to the announcement.
``Throughout the airline industry, flight attendants have been
subject to weight programs tied to appearance, not performance,''
the union said in a statement.
   The flight attendants' current contract remains in effect until
the buyout is completed. Negotiations for a new contract have been
going on since September 1987. Flight attendants rejected a
tentative contract in November 1987.
   Susan Bianchi-Sand, union president, noted that flight
attendants, formerly called ``skygirls'' or ``stewardesses'' and
``stewards,'' have worked on airplanes since 1930.
   ``Sixty years later, the United flight attendants can now pride
themselves on being new aviation pioneers as they take the bold
steps toward owning their airline,'' said Ms. Bianchi-Sand.
   Union members flying with United make up about half of the
union's membership, with the remainder working for 17 other
airlines.

<TEXT>
   A leading member of an Iranian opposition movement
was shot to death Tuesday outside a lakeside town near Geneva as he
was driving home, the movement said in a communique.
   Kazem Rajavi of the Mujahedeen Khalq, a Baghdad-based Iranian
exile group, was killed by one or two assailants in Coppet, 7 miles
east of Geneva, the movement said. He was the brother of Massoud
Rajavi, leader of the Mujahedeen resistence movement.
   Swiss police did not immediately identify the victim, but said
several 9mm shells were found at the scene.
   In a communique from the Iraqi capital, the Mujahedeen claimed
Dr. Kazem Rajavi, the organization's Geneva representative, was
assassinated by ``the (Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini regime's
terrorist agents.''
   Rajavi had been in Geneva several years to publicize Iranian
human rights violations. He often appealed to U.N. representatives
to investigate Iran's rights situation and held several press
conferences during a February-March session of the U.N. Human
Rights Commission.
   Massoud Rajavi in a statement from Baghdad charged that ``the
Khomeini regime's embassy in Switzerland, acting on direct
instructions from (Iranian leader Hashemi) Rafsanjani, carried out
this crime.''
   In a statement from Washington, Reza Pahlavi, son of Iran's
deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, said the assassination ``once
again illustrates the unchanged and continuing terrorist nature of
the regime in Tehran.''
   A February report issued by U.N. Special Representative Reynaldo
Galndo Pohl listed the names of 700 people allegedly executed by
Iran but also listed 39 people believed killed by the Mujahedeen.
The report also cited evidence of torture and other violations
along with government denials.
   The report was denounced by the Mujahedeen as a ``whitewash.''
   The Mujahedeen were first allied with Khomeini in the struggle
to topple the late Shah. But in 1980-81, a year after Khomeini took
power, he turned on the group and other leftist factions, killing
and imprisoning tens of thousands of people.
   The Mujahedeen and their military wing, the National Liberation
Army, receive training and support from Iraq. The group is
estimated to have 20,000 fighters.

   The first Japanese astronaut to board a U.S. space
shuttle is a former assistant professor of nuclear engineering, the
National Space Development Agency announced Tuesday.
   Mamoru Mohri, 42, was selected for the mission in June 1991 from
among three final candidates, NASDA officials said. The three were
chosen from 533 applicants in 1985.
   Since then, Mohri and the two other finalists _ Takao Doi, 35, a
researcher at NASA's Lewis Research Center in Ohio, and Chiaki
Naito, 37, a cardiosurgeon _have undergone training in Japan and
the United States.
   Mohri will be the first Japanese astronaut to ride on a U.S.
space shuttle.
   An eight-member screening committee, set up in February and led
by NASDA Vice President Kenji Funakawa, conducted a series of
meetings to evaluate each of the Japanese candidates on the basis
of health, ability to operate the experimental equipment, and
English-language ability, the officials said.
   ``I waited a long time to be chosen for the leading role in this
next stage of riding on the space shuttle,'' Mohri said in a
televised news conference. ``I still intend to pursue further
training.''
   Mohri and the two other Japanese candidates will leave for the
United States on April 29 to participate in a year of NASA training.
   Doi and Ms. Naito will undergo the training as ground-support
crew members.
   The Atlantic shuttle is scheduled to be launched June 17, 1991,
with six U.S. astronauts joining Mohri.
   Mohri, who majored in surface physics and ultra-high vacuum
science at Hokkaido University, is a native of Yoichi, on the
Japanese island of Hokkaido. He formerly taught nuclear engineering
at Hokkaido University.

   Six siblings living as refugees for more
than four years in the Italian embassy in Albania have refused an
Albanian offer to emigrate, saying they do not trust the
government, a diplomat reported Tuesday.
   The Popa family members, two brothers and four sisters aged 52
to 65, walked into the Italian embassy in the capital Tirana on
Dec. 12, 1985, and demanded asylum. They told diplomats they had
been confined almost 20 years to Kules, a village west of Tirana,
because a brother had defected to the West.
   It was the first known case of Albanians seeking shelter in a
Western embassy.
   On Monday, the official Albanian news agency said the six were
free to emigrate after they received Albanian passports and visas.
Albania is a hard-line Stalinist state that has been loosening some
of its controls in recent months.
   But the siblings have rejected those terms, apparently fearful
of what could happen after they leave the safety of the embassy to
apply for the passports and visas.
   ``The problem lies in the formalities requested by the Albanian
government which directly concern the Popa brothers,'' said Paolo
de Nicolo, first secretary of the Italian Embassy in Tirana. ``They
would have to spend one or two days outside the mission under
Albanian sovereignty.''
   He said the siblings have also refused to apply for standard
emigration visas.
   ``This they refuse to do,'' de Nicolo said. ``They consider
themselves political refugees eager to leave the country at once.''
   De Nicolo said Italy and Albania were continuing to work on an
acceptable solution to the standoff.

<TEXT>
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad
Movement-Jerusalem said Tuesday it would launch attacks against
Americans unless the U.S. Senate reverses a motion endorsing a
united Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
   The group made the threat in an Arabic-language typewritten
statement delivered to Beirut's An-Nahar newspaper.
   ``The American Senate should reverse its decision in 10 days, or
else every American inside and outside Moslem countries will be a
target of terrorism and revenge,'' said the statement.
   The U.S. Senate, on a voice vote, passed a motion March 22
endorsing a united Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
   The motion is non-binding and is opposed by the Bush
administration, which does not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's
capital.
   The communique said the U.S. move has ``encouraged the Zionists
and made them capture ... a building belonging to Greek Orthodox
Palestinians ... as a step which will be followed by others.''
   Some 150 Jews occupied a 72-room building complex in the heart
of the Arab Christian quarter of old Jerusalem earlier this month.
   The Greek Orthodox church has filed a lawsuit against the new
settlement, claiming the four buildings it occupies are owned by
the church and were illegally sold by a former tenant.
   The United States has denounced the settlement as well as the
use of U.S. aid money to finance it.
   No details were available on Islamic Jihad Movement-Jerusalem.
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad-Beit al-Maqdis, or Islamic
Holy War-Jerusalem, claimed responsibility for a bus attack in
Egypt in February that killed nine Israelis.
   But the leader of Islamic Jihad-Beit al-Maqdis, Assad Bayoud
al-Tammimi, told The Associated Press in Amman that his group was
not responsible for the latest threat.
   ``I'm not aware of it at all and have not heard of such a
movement,'' he said.
   Hours after the statement was released in Beirut, the U.S. House
of Representatives approved a non-binding resolution identical to
the Senate measure recognizing a united Jerusalem as Israel's
capital.
   The 378-to-34 vote came despite arguments the move would stir
resentment among Arab states and complicate administration efforts
to achieve peace.
   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kansas, complained after a
trip to the Middle East this month that the Senate move damaged
peace efforts and said he regretted supporting it.
   Jerusalem is regarded as a holy city by Christians, Moslems and
Jews. Israel annexed Arab east Jerusalem after the 1967
Arab-Israeli war, and declared the united city as its ``eternal
capital.''
   But U.S. policy holds that Jerusalem's status must be determined
through negotiations among all parties. The U.S. Embassy to Israel
is in Tel Aviv.

   The U.S. Census Bureau, under heavy criticism for
missing millions of people when it mailed forms to John and Jane Q.
Public, on Tuesday was preparing an army of counters to hit the
streets and find more.
   Across the country, census workers _ ``enumerators'' in census
lingo _ were handed cardboard briefcases and told to have their No.
2 pencils ready for the mammoth job they face when they begin
knocking on doors Thursday. They began three days of training on
Monday.
   ``Don't take anyone with you and don't talk to anyone about
census results _ except your crew leader,'' Cozella Brown cautioned
her crew of seven at a training session Tuesday.
   ``If (residents) refuse to answer, tell them you're coming
back,'' she said.
   Persistence might be what's called for, given that just 63
percent of U.S. households had returned census forms mailed to
their homes as of Tuesday, said Rudolph Brewington, a spokesman at
Census Bureau headquarters in Suitland, Md.
   The 1990 response rate compares with 75 percent of U.S.
households mailing in forms in 1980 and falls short of the Census
Bureau's own prediction that 70 percent would drop their census
forms in the mailbox this year.
   At its peak in the next several weeks, the Census Bureau
estimates 330,000 enumerators, 5,000 in Chicago alone, will be
knocking on the doors of the previously uncounted.
   Critics say that even with the large number of enumerators hired
for this phase of the census _ called ``non-response follow-up''_
many Americans may still fall through the cracks.
   ``How many (enumerators) are bilingual? They don't take that
into account,'' said Maurice Sone, Midwest Census Coordinator for
the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund.
   ``Enthusiasm to participate is there,'' said Sone. ``The biggest
problem we've had is people who didn't get the forms. ... There is
a real danger of undercount.''
   Brewington said, however, that a greater percentage of Hispanics
have responded to the census than of any other population group.
   ``This is a great surprise,'' he said. ``Hispanics are leading
... and closely behind Hispanics are blacks.
   ``The people who are really not responding are suburban white
households,'' he said.
   Workers were told at Miss Brown's session that residents won't
have an easy time avoiding the census. Should an enumerator fail to
get a response after three attempts, Miss Brown herself will make
three tries. If she fails, her boss then will try three more times.
   ``Be friendly, yet firm,'' a workbook urges census workers.
   Even so, Miss Brown's field supervisor, Leobie Jackson, conceded
some people will remain uncounted.
   ``There are 100 reasons why people might not want to send their
forms in,'' Jackson said. ``I can see very easily that there could
be an undercount. We try to enumerate every person _ that's all we
can do.''

   Florida's agriculture commissioner announced
Tuesday the state will begin aerial pesticide spraying to combat an
infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies.
   A malathion compound will be sprayed by helicopter beginning
Thursday in a mostly residential, 16-square-mile area, commissioner
Doyle Conner said at a news conference.
   The spraying will continue for four weeks followed by the
release of millions of sterile Medflies over a 75-day period to
break the breeding cycle. Fruit quarantine boundaries have not yet
been established.
   Six of the crop-destroying pests have been discovered near Miami
International Airport, including two on Tuesday.
   Conner said the eradication program has proven successful and is
the best approach, despite environmental concerns raised over
similar sprayings in California.
   Consumer activists and local governments in Southern California
have protested the repeated spraying of malathion-laced syrup on
suburban neighborhoods. The Medfly has spread from suburban back
yards to orange and grapefruit groves in some of the region's
richest farmland.
   ``Those who advocate deviating from accepted scientific
procedures, you run into the grave risk of getting into the
predicament California is in,'' Conner said. ``We don't want to
stay in this program a day longer than necessary.''
   Bobby McKown, executive vice president of Florida Citrus Mutual
in Lakeland, said Monday the 12,000-member growers' organization
supports ``immediate action to control and eradicate the Medflies
so they don't expand beyond residential areas.''
   Medflies, considered one of the world's most serious
agricultural pests, are about half the size of houseflies. They do
not sting and pose no threat to humans, but the larvae hatching
inside more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables can turn it
to inedible mush.
   Conner said the 2.4 ounces of malathion to be sprayed per acre
with a syrupy insect food bait posed no health risk, but an
environmentalist blasted the announcement.
   ``The bad thing about using these kinds of chemicals is that
they wipe out all the insects in an area _ the good and the bad,''
said Lee Emerson, vice president of the environment group Friends
of the Oleta River.
   It's not the kind of balanced, environmentally sensitive
approach we should be taking these days,'' he said.
   The zone to be sprayed covers suburban Miami Springs, Virginia
Gardens, part of Hialeah and unincorporated areas northwest of
downtown Miami. The latest fly was found Tuesday in Virginia
Gardens.
   The Florida Medfly Advisory Group, which includes Medfly experts
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, expanded the area of
intensive trapping Monday from 81 to 106 square miles and beefed up
the inspection staff.
   Traps were set in fruit trees by state agricultural inspectors
around Dade County following the discovery April 16 of a lone male
Medfly near the airport. Two more males were found last weekend in
sour-orange trees in Miami Springs and Hialeah, and one female in a
calamondin tree in Miami Springs.
   Some 60,000 gallons of malathion in a stronger concentration,
about 3.1 ounces per acre, are used annually throughout Florida for
mosquito control.
   The last Medfly infestation in South Florida was in 1987 when
five males were found in Hialeah. The last major outbreak to affect
Florida's commercial groves spread across 28 counties in 1956.

   The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council awarded a
special medal Tuesday to Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Colin
Powell in honor of the American soldiers troops who helped liberate
Nazi death camps 45 years ago.
   In a ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda, the council presented
Powell with the Eisenhower Liberation Medal, named for the former
president and supreme commander of the allied forces in Europe.
   Powell, in his speech, remembered the men of the 4th Armored
Division who liberated the concentration camp at Ohrdruf.
   Powell described the men as ``tough, fearless. They felt they
were invincible.'' Yet when they came upon the mass destruction of
humanity, that included 3,200 bodies in shallow graves, they were
overwhelmed.
   In a cable to Washington, Eisenhower talked about the
``unspeakable conditions. ... For most of it, I have no words,''
Powell said.
   The audience that filled the Rotunda included Holocaust
survivors, members of Congress and officials from the council,
which is building the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum near the Mall
in Washington, D.C.
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp told the
audience that ``we all must recommit ourselves to the integrity of
memory and the truth of history.''
   Kemp warned against playing politics with the survival of
Israel, saying any attempt its enemies to destroy the country is
finishing the work of the Holocaust.
   As part of the memorial ceremony, members of Congress joined
with survivors of the death camps in lighting six candles to
remember the six million Jews and millions of others killed by the
Nazi regime in Germany from 1933, when it came to power, until its
defeat in 1945.

   The World Health Organization said Tuesday that
serious cases of diarrhea and other food-related infirmities are
increasing dramatically and already kill more than 4 million
children each year in the Third World.
   The WHO also said 20 percent to 50 percent of the almost 2.6
billion people who traveled to countries other then their place of
residence last year suffered from diarrhea.
   In a new food safety guide, the agency said diarrhea kills 4
million to 5 million children under age 5 each year in developing
countries. The children usually die of dehydration as a result of
diarrhea.
   ``In the first two years of life, as many as 15 out of every
1,000 children die from diarrhea,'' the pamphlet said. Diarrhea
cases still account for at least 30 percent of pediatric
hospitalization in many areas of the world, according to the guide.
   The WHO said ``that in many countries, the incidence (of
diarrhea) has dramatically increased over the past several years.''

<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Franjo Tudjman said Tuesday he was
confident his center-right Croatian Democratic Union party would
emerge with a majority from Croatia's first free elections in 50
years.
   Preliminary results of Sunday's elections showed the party
leading in races for 111 of the 196 seats in two chambers of the
three-house parliament.
   ``I am confident that the CDU will win more than 60 percent of
parliamentary seats after the second round of the vote,'' to be
held in two weeks, Tudjman told journalists at a news conference.
   With about 70 percent counted of the nearly 2.8 million votes
cast, the governing reform Communist Party _ renamed the Party for
Democratic Reform _ led in races for 50 seats and the centrist
Coalition for National Accord, 14.
   In about 20 of the 111 constituencies in which the CDU led,
however, a combination of communists and their left-wing allies,
who are certain to field joint candidates in the run-offs, were
actually ahead in total number of votes.
   No results were available for the remaining constituencies nor
in Monday's voting for the third house of parliament, the 160-seat
Labor Chamber.
   The third house is a remnant of Yugoslavia's communist-style
constitution.
   Tudjman said that once his party assumes power, its first tasks
will be to prepare a new, Western-style demoncratic constitution
for Croatia and to discuss Yugoslavia's future with other states in
the federation.
   He told journalists Yugoslavia could continue to exist only if
it becomes a loose alliance of semi-independent states.
   Tudjman's party waged a campaign based largely on national
sentiments. Ranged against the CDU were Serbs, who comprise about
10 percent of Croatia's 4.8 million people.
   The CDU has been accused in Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest,
communist-ruled state, of being ``fascist and separatist.''
   Serbia and Croatia, the second-largest state, have been rivals
since they united in Yugoslavia in the aftermath of World War I.
   Yugoslavia is currently a loose federation. Slovenia and Croatia
now have held Yugoslavia's first post-World War II multiparty
elections. Macedonia and the republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
plan similar elections later this year. Communist-ruled Montenegro
and Serbia have not legalized opposition parties.
   Tudjman said his party would strive to ``enlist other democratic
forces'' in forming Croatia's new government. He left open the
possibility of inviting representatives of the Serbian community to
serve in the administration.
   A CDU government ``will stop the extraction of Croatia's ...
wealth'' by Belgrade, Tudjman said.
   Belgrade serves as both federal capital and Serbia's capital.
Croatia says Serbia unfairly dominates federal authorities.
   Tudjman said his party's economic program would be one ``based
on a market economy in which no ideology will be allowed to
interfere ever again.''
   He said private and joint stock companies would receive support,
but his party would not allow wholesale privatization of state
firms.

   The independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar
said Tuesday that pro-Iranian kidnappers will not free any more
U.S. hostages unless Israel releases Arab prisoners.
   It said the Shiite Moslem militants also expect the release of
15 radicals from a Kuwaiti prison for bombing the U.S. and French
embassies in Kuwait in 1983 before ``another goodwill gesture'' is
made and more captives are freed.
   Sunday's release of Robert Polhill, 55, of New York, after 39
months in captivity raised hopes another Western hostage could be
freed.
   Polhill and fellow U.S. educators Jesse Turner of Boise, Idaho,
and Alann Steen of Boston were abducted in Beirut on Jan. 24, 1987,
by a group known as Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Freedom for the Kuwaiti prisoners has been the key demand of
another organization known as Islamic Jihad, or holy war, which
holds American hostages Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped on March 16, 1985, and educator Sutherland,
58, of Fort Collins, Colo., on June 9, 1985.
   Five other Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss,
an Italian and an Irishman are also missing and believed held in
Lebanon.
   The United States refuses to pressure Kuwait on the hostage
issue.
   An-Nahar said Polhill's release was ``of a humanitarian nature
and not related to any secret deal with Washington.''
   The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia reportedly
released four prisoners Tuesday to mark the Moslem holiday of Eid
al-Fitr, sources in south Lebanon said, but they denied it was part
of a deal to free Western hostages.
   Israel television said the four were from south Lebanon and were
not involved in guerrilla attacks.
   Israel also plans to free prisoners for the holiday, but Israeli
officials insisted this had nothing to do with demands for
``goodwill gestures.''
   Even so, such gestures could be read as a positive sign by
radical groups holding the hostages.
   Sources close to the 2,500-member SLA, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said SLA commander Antoine Lahad will free perhaps 12
prisoners from the 300 Lebanese Shiites and Palestinians held in
Khiam prison in south Lebanon.
   The sources said such releases are traditional during the
holiday. They denied Lahad would free up to 40 prisoners, as
reported by the Independent daily newspaper in London.
   Israel freed about 700 prisoners in 1985 following the release
of 37 Americans held by Shiite extremists who hijacked a TWA
jetliner.
   Israel denied that was linked to the Americans' release. Arab
sources said it was.
   A pro-Syrian militia leader, Mustafa Saad of the Popular
Nasserite Organization, meanwhile said he was working for the
release of kidnapped Swiss Red Cross workers Emmanuel Christen and
Elio Erriquez.
   Saad's militia controls Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
Christen and Erriquez were kidnapped on the edge of Sidon Oct. 6.
   No group claimed responsibility. Police and other security
sources, however, blamed the Fatah-Revolutionary Council group of
Palestinian terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal. They said the abduction
was linked to the imprisonment in Switzerland of Hussein Hariri,
22, a Lebanese Shiite hijacker who belonged to the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The sources believe Hezbollah and Fatah-Revolutionary Council
carry out terrorist operations on each other's behalf.
   Abu Nidal's Libyan-backed movement denied involvement in the
abduction of the Red Cross workers, but admitted in November 1987
it holds four Belgians seized aboard the yacht Silko as it sailed
off Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip.
   The Sunni Moslem newspaper Al-Liwa, in an unattributed report,
said a deal has been worked out between Belgium and Abu Nidal's
faction to release the four next week in return for freeing
Palestinian terrorist Said Nasser from a Belgian jail.
   Nasser is serving 20 years for a 1980 grenade attack on a
synagogue in Belgium that killed a Jew.
   Al-Liwa said under the deal, Nasser would be released by May 17.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi asked this month for the release
of all hostages in Lebanon.
   The Fatah-RC of Abu Nidal _ whose real name is Sabri al-Banna _
on April 10 released three other hostages, a European couple and
their daughter, arising from the yacht seizure.

   Christian militia chieftain Samir Geagea
imposed a sea blockade on Gen. Michel Aoun's forces in the latest
escalation of their 3-month-old power struggle, police said Tuesday.
   The rival Christian forces also exchanged heavy artillery and
mortar fire Tuesday, striking residential areas of east Beirut and
towns throughout the Christian enclave.
   Police said one person was killed and four wounded in earlier
shelling, but there were no reports of casualties from the latest
fighting. At least 894 people have been killed and 2,399 wounded
since Jan. 30 when the two sides began their fight for control of
Lebanon's Christian enclave.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said Geagea's boats began the blockade Monday and were
preventing even fishing boats from sailing off the three-mile
stretch of coast held by Aoun's troops.
   Security sources said the Lebanese Forces have one gunboat, one
patrol boat and about 20 speedboats fitted ith machine guns and
rocket launchers.
   Aoun is reported to have two crippled gunboats hidden somewhere
near Dbaye, a coastal village north of Beirut which is the only
outlet to the sea for his forces.
   The Lebanese Forces' blockade was clearly aimed at preventing
Aoun from shipping in ammunition and weapons through Dbaye.
   On Monday, the Lebanese Forces boats intercepted a passenger
boat and refused to let it dock at a makeshift port operated by
Aoun's troops near Dbaye, the police spokeman said.
   A militia communique said the boat was not carrying any
passengers. It did not say how many crewmen were on board or give
the boat's registry.
   The militia boats also intercepted an unidentified motor launch
that had left the Dbaye area and was heading north, the police
spokesman said.
   He said the two vessels were escorted by the militia boats to
the port of Jounieh, 12{ miles north of Beirut.
   Geagea's 6,000-strong militia, which has a reserve force of
30,000 men, controls the northern and southern edges to Aoun's
narrow enclave and holds most of the Christian enclave's
28-mile-long coastline.
   The Lebanese Forces have used howitzers and rocket launchers to
fire on vessels approaching Aoun's territory.
   The 310-square-mile Christian enclave, about one-tenth of
Lebanon, is ringed on its landward sides by Syrian troops and their
Moslem militia allies.
   Aoun, with some 19,000 troops, moved against Geagea in January
in a bid to crush his only serious challenger for control of the
Christian enclave.
   But Geagea's militia held on, and the rival armies have fought
each other to an inconclusive standstill in the bloodiest clash
between Christian rivals since Lebanon's civil war erupted in 1975.
   Aoun refuses to recognize President Elias Hrawi, a Maronite
Catholic, or accept an Arab League-brokered peace treaty that Hrawi
is supposed to implement. Aoun contends the treaty legitimizes the
occupation of Lebanon by 40,000 Syrian soldiers.
   Geagea has recognized the Syrian-backed Hrawi.

   Newspaper publishers may be close to winning
a 6-year-old ``guerilla war'' with the Bell telecommunications
companies over who can transmit electronic information in the
future, a publisher said Tuesday.
   Robert M. Johnson, publisher, president and chief executive
officer of Newsday Inc. of Melville, N.Y., reported that Congress
is likely to pass a bill soon setting a telecommunications public
policy.
   ``We think we are in as strong a position as we've ever been,''
said Johnson, who has testified in Congress on behalf of the
American Newspaper Publishers Association. His report was given at
a luncheon of the ANPA's 104th annual convention at the Century
Plaza Hotel.
   Johnson said the Bell companies have set aside a $25 million
``war chest'' to fight for the right to publish information on its
electronic circuits. He said Bell seeks to launch an ``electronic
Yellow Pages'' which would compete directly with newspaper
advertising.
   Such actions would violate a 1984 federal court decision that
set out the principle of diversity in dividing AT&amp;T into separate
companies, he said.
   Citing antitrust laws, U.S. District Judge Harold Greene held
that those who control telecommunication lines should not also
control the information that goes over those lines, Johnson said.
   ``For the next six years we were engaged in guerilla war,'' he
said, recounting how Bell companies lobbied for exceptions and ``in
some cases they just violated the consent decree.''
   Johnson said that in the past year a task force of the ANPA has
worked with Congress ``to see if we can come up with a legislative
solution.
   ``The result of those long negotiations was a new draft bill,''
he said. ``It is from our point of view the best piece of
legislation we've seen emerge from Congress to protect the
diversity principle.''
   However, the bill has not yet been passed, and a court appeal of
the original federal order has sent that back to Greene for
reconsideration, Johnson said.
   The outcome will determine whether ``the newspaper industry is
going to face a whole new group of competitors in the electronic
information services,'' he said.

   Scores of World War I veterans have come
to this small town to mark the 75th anniversary of the Gallipoli
campaign, one of the British empire's worst defeats in the war.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, Australian Prime
Minister Bob Hawke and the governor general of New Zealand, Paul
Reeve, will join about 70 veterans, ranging in age from 90 to 103,
to mark the anniversary Wednesday.
   On Friday, 46 Australian veterans flew to Turkey aboard a jet
specially equipped with a mini-hospital to care for the veterans in
case of medical emergencies.
   For the first time since World War I, two Australian warships,
the Tobruk and the Sydney, have dropped anchor in the area. Aboard
are 160 soldiers who will take part in the ceremonies. More than
400 tourists are also expected to witness the ceremonies.
   The nine-month Gallipoli campaign was designed to seize the area
around the Dardanelles, capture the imperial capital of Istanbul _
then called Constantinople, and force the Ottoman Empire, which had
joined forces with Germany and Austria-Hungary, out of the war.
   But the campaign failed in the face of stiff Turkish resistance
and the allies, mostly soldiers from New Zealand and Australia,
were forced to withdraw their forces.
   It is estimated 76,000 allied troops died as well as 250,000
Ottoman soldiers.
   Allison Russell, a psychiatric nurse from Melbourne, said she
came to Gallipoli because ``so many of our men came here and so
many did not come back.''
   For the Turks, the staunch resistance of the Ottoman soldiers at
Gallipoli was the first victory in a war that eventually led to
defeat and the collapse of the Ottoman empire.
   The commander of the Ottoman armies at Gallipoli, Kemal
Attaturk, later went on to establish the Turkish republic.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Finds No Common-Law Marriage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court on Tuesday unanimously upheld a
state judge's decision that Oscar-winning actor William Hurt did
not have a common-law marriage with a woman who subsequently bore
his son.
   Sandra Jennings, a former New York City Ballet dancer and mother
of 7-year-old Alexander Devon Hurt, lived with the star of ``The
Accidental Tourist'' and ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' from 1981 to
1984.
   She sought to prove a marriage existed so she could sue for
divorce and a share of Hurt's assets, estimated during a six-day
trial in June at $10 million.
   Trial testimony revealed Hurt, 40, paid Jennings $65,000
annually and let her live in an apartment he owns in Manhattan.
   New York abolished common-law marriages in 1933, but South
Carolina still recognizes them. Jennings' claim was based on the 10
weeks she and Hurt lived together in South Carolina in late 1982
while he was filming ``The Big Chill.''
   Justice Jacqueline W. Silbermann rejected her claims on Oct. 3,
saying the evidence was insufficient and questioning Jennings'
credibility.
   The decision was unanimously upheld by a five-judge panel of the
Appellate Division of state Supreme Court, the trial-level court,
in Manhattan.
   Jennings' lawyer, Richard Golub, claimed after Silbermann's
verdict that the judge was ``star-struck'' and ``madly in love''
with Hurt.
   ``Let five judges who are men decide this, not one woman who's
impressed by a movie star,'' he said in announcing his appeal.
   All five appellate judges were men.
   Reached Tuesday at his office, Golub refused to comment on his
previous statements other than to say, ``I take the responsibility
for everything I do.''
   He said he would seek to appeal the decision to the state's
highest court.
   Jennings, 33, who had been teaching dance in Puerto Rico, was en
route to New York on Tuesday and could not be reached, Golub said.
   Hurt's attorney, Martin Shelton, said Hurt was filming in
Portugal and could not be reached.
   Hurt, who divorced his first wife, actress Mary Beth Hurt, after
meeting Jennings, remarried in March 1989.

   Animal research supporters marked the
35th anniversary of the Salk polio vaccine Tuesday by wheeling an
iron lung to a rally by opponents of animal experimentation.
   The iron lung was once used to treat patients of the disease,
which was finally conquered by a vaccine developed from animal
research.
   The machine stood in the midst of an angry confrontation at the
University of California-Berkeley, where hundreds of sign-wielding
scientists and students on both sides of the issue clashed.
   At least 28 protesters were arrested.
   The rally included a rowdy march around the campus to mark World
Laboratory Animal Liberation Week. About 250 of the animal-research
opponents chanted during the burning in effigy of an anonymous
researcher with a blood-red dollar sign on its white jacket.
   The protesters _ vegetarians against vivisection, purple-haired
punks wearing chains, veterinarians, humanities professors and
students holding pictures of mutilated monkeys _ confronted a row
of police in riot gear at a $14 million animal research facility
under construction.
   Some tossed stink bombs at police while others knocked down a
chain-link fence. Shortly afterward, a half-dozen protesters
chained themselves to the fence of a psychology building where
other research is conducted. Several windows were broken.
   ``Stop the testing and torture,'' some signs read.
``Vivisection, the sacrifice of creatures we regard as `inferior'
beings, differs little from concentration camps or slave traders,''
read another.
   The protesters, claiming UC-Berkeley researchers use and destroy
80,000 animals a year, passed out leaflets accusing five professors
of ``irresponsibility, negligence and cruelty.''
   One of those cited, Dr. Charles S. Nicoll of the Department of
Integrative Biology, strongly defended animal research.
   ``No question about it,'' Nicoll said. ``A small percentage of
animal research is pretty horrid, pretty gruesome. But these
animals are anesthetized. They're not treated without care and
concern. It's not very nice to take a healthy animal and cause it
to have brain damage. But it is a less nice thing to do to not try
to help the 500,000 humans who suffer brain injuries every year.
   ``Unless we do animal research on things like brain damage, we
will never be able to help brain-injured humans recover,'' he said.
   Nicoll said scientists learn a lot from research on animals,
most of which causes the subjects no discomfort.
   Researcher Sharon Russell, a physiologist, said the protesters
mean well but are ``misguided.''
   ``We love animals and we don't want to torture them and see them
mistreated, and we don't allow that,'' Russell said. ``There are
firm rules (about research methods). I feel good about my work.''
   She noted how animal research led to development of the Salk
polio vaccine, saving millions of children from what was an
epidemic in the 1950s.
   But Dr. Elliot Katz, a San Rafael veterinarian and member of In
Defense of Animals, said researchers then had fewer alternatives.
   ``We have other ways of testing the effectiveness and safety of
vaccines now,'' he said.
   Also Tuesday, 27 protesters in Maryland were arrested during a
midday demonstration by about 300 opponents of animal research at
the National Institutes of Health, authorities said. Charges
included trespassing, assault on a police officer and resisting
arrest.
   After speeches criticizing the institutes' role in animal
experimentation, the group marched to the Veterinary Resources
Branch. NIH security officers formed a line around the building,
and protesters were warned that anyone crossing police lines would
be arrested.

<HEAD>Wallop: Air Force Proposes Cutting Missiles to Meet Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA PRODIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Malcolm Wallop confirmed Tuesday
the Air Force wants to cancel deployment of MX missiles on rail
cars and slow Midgetman missile production, but said the proposal
``will not prevail.''
   ``This is something that was forwarded to Secretary of Defense
Dick Cheney and will not be approved,'' Wallop, R-Wyo., a member of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a telephone interview.
   The Air Force suggested the cuts after Cheney requested the
armed services develop defense priorities within the constraints of
the 1992 budget, Wallop said.
   ``It was produced by an Air Force staff person over the Easter
break,'' Wallop said. ``These are selections of the Air Force's
priority. They will not be the priority of the Bush administration
or the secretary of defense.''
   The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday the Air Force also wants
to cut its B-2 stealth bomber force in half to meet the budget
constraints. The Times, citing unidentified Pentagon sources, said
the Air Force wants Cheney to shift the U.S. nuclear arsenal from
land missiles to bombers and submarines.
   The Air Force recommended a fleet of 65 B-2 stealth bombers,
rather than the 132 radar-evading planes originally sought, the
newspaper reported.
   If approved, the cutback of land-based missiles would be a break
with Bush administration policy to modernize all the nuclear
arsenal.
   Wallop did not name the soure of the recommendations, but the
Times said Air Force Secretary Donald B. Rice sent them to Cheney
on Friday.
   Defense officials also said Cheney and top Pentagon advisers
would resist.
   Cheney has argued that the United States must respond to the
Soviet Union's modernization of its weapons.
   But Cheney also has told the military that budgets for
long-range nuclear weapons will fall by 3 percent to 5 percent
annually over the next five years.
   Once source told the Times that ending the MX ``rail-garrison
Peacekeeper'' program and going slow with Midgetman production
could save as much as $15 billion.
   Cheney is expected to tell congressional committees on Thursday
that he will recommend B-2 bomber production, but will adopt the
Air Force's proposal to reduce their numbers.
   The Air Force said the 10-warhead MX missiles should be based in
silos built to house older missiles, rather than ride the nation's
rail system on special cars. Construction of the rail-garrison
project is scheduled to begin this June and be operational by June
1992.
   The single-warhead Midgetman missile would not go into full
production before the end of the century. The proposed force of 500
Midgetman missiles would replace the MX in silos scattered across
Wyoming and Nebraska.
   The Midgetman originally was to be ferried across the western
United States on trucks.
   The Air Force also would cancel a request for more than $2
billion that Cheney proposed to spend on rail cars for the MX, the
Times said.
   Pentagon sources said the Air Force recently urged Cheney to
approve production of five to 10 B-2s a year for at least the next
five years. Such a plan would keep annual spending on the B-2
program below $8 billion.
   That would affect growth plans by the plane's manufacturer,
Northrop Corp., which hopes to increase annual B-2 production to 30
aircraft by 1995.
   Officials said the Air Force's plans for slowed nuclear missile
modernization resembles a package of proposals advanced by Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

   Burning crude oil from derailed railroad
tank cars was extinguished Tuesday, and environmental officials
tried to contain a goopy mixture of chemicals and oil that spilled
into an Allegheny River tributary.
   Fires began after 29 cars of a 97-car freight train owned by
Buffalo &amp; Pittsburgh Railroad Inc. derailed Sunday in a steep
ravine 45 miles north of Pittsburgh. Two tank cars carrying crude
oil exploded late Monday, and workers barely escaped injury.
   A ``major assault'' was launched Tuesday morning after flames
had died down sufficiently for foam retardant to suffocate two
fires burning at the site along Buffalo Creek, a popular trout
stream, said Don Grafton, fire chief of the Worthington Volunteer
Fire Department in Armstrong County.
   ``Everything really looks super. It looks like we have it
licked,'' Grafton said.
   Investigators from the Federal Railroad Administration and
National Transportation Safety Board did not know what caused the
derailment, which forced the evacuation of 200 people.
   Janet Burke, one of some 50 people still out of their homes
Tuesday, said she, her husband and 17-year-old son were home Sunday
night when ``the house started to shake.''
   ``They said, `Run just as fast as you can run,''' she said.
``You could see the train going down the tracks. There were sparks
everywhere, and then there was an explosion. The whole woods were
on fire.''
   Mrs. Burke said she saw the vinyl siding on her home begin to
melt and she had no idea Tuesday if her home was still intact.
   ``The cars were in our yard. The railroad cars were that
close,'' she said. ``It was such a scary thing.''
   The crash released an undetermined quantity of crude oil and
sodium hydroxide, a caustic chemical used to clean drains, into the
creek, which joins the Allegheny 10 to 15 miles downstream. The
Allegheny supplies drinking water to several communities in the
Pittsburgh area.
   Crews were able to remove 21 tanker cars Monday, but the
remaining cars were either on fire or too close to the flames to
move. Firefighters sprayed the tankers with water to keep them
cool, but stopped later that day when state environmental officials
discovered 30,000 to 50,000 gallons of the water-and-oil mixture
was spilling over makeshift dikes and into the creek.
   Shortly after they stopped the spraying, the two tank cars
exploded.
   ``The only thing we saw _ in front of us, back of us, on top of
us _ was fire,'' said John Kaus, fire marshal in neighboring
Allegheny County and deputy coordinator of its Emergency Management
Agency. It was ``like walking through hell.''
   Sodium hydroxide also leaked into the stream from the saturated
ground, killing thousands of fish, state Fish Commission officials
said.
   ``There's too many to count,'' said Emil Svetahor, a commission
official. ``This will be a long-term recovery.''
   Railroad vice president John Bell said 15,000 gallons of the
chemical was unaccounted for.
   ``We believe a substantial amount of that is still in the ground
or has been picked up'' by booms, he said. ``But we know some of it
got in the creek.''
   Crews worked Tuesday to remove the remaining eight cars from the
site. Kaus said four of the cars contained a total 55,000 gallons
of crude oil.
   The oil-chemical mixture was ``floating along the surface in
clumps, not like a sheen,'' said Betsy Mallison, spokeswoman for
the state Department of Environmental Resources.
   However, much of the oil from Sunday's crash burned, she said.
   Communities along the Allegheny braced Tuesday for possible
problems to their water supplies when the mixture passes their
water intakes.
   Fifty Craigsville residents stayed with friends and family or at
the Worthington Fire Hall while waiting for an evacuation order to
be lifted.

<HEAD>University President Investigated For Phone Calls, Reports Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outgoing American University President Richard
Berendzen is being investigated by northern Virginia authorities
for allgedly making obscene telephone calls from his office, two
televison stations said Tuesday.
   Stations WUSA and WRC said Fairfax County police traced obscene
calls made to women who advertised babysitting services to
Berendzen's office in Washington.
   Unidentified sources were quoted as saying that the
investigation began a month ago and that through the use of
telephone recording and tracing devices, the source of the calls
was found to be a telephone in Berendzen's office.
   Fairfax Police issued a one-sentence statement saying that
Berendzen had not been arrested.
   Authorities declined further comment, saying that they do not
discuss investigations in progress.
   Fairfax Commonwealth's Attorney Robert Horan said that police
were ``looking into certain complaints made against Dr.
Berendzen,'' but would not discuss the nature of the complaints.
   Horan said no charges had been filed and none was expected soon.
   The Fairfax probe began when a county woman got what she claimed
was a ``filthy and frightening'' telephone call after placing an
advertisement in The Washington Post saying that she would provide
day care for children in her home, the television stations said.
   She immediately went to police, who arranged the recordings,
according to the accounts.
   Berendzen, 51, resigned April 10, cited exhaustion as the
reason. He said he wanted to continue in his position until the end
of the academic year. He came to the university in 1974 as dean of
the College Arts and Sciences, became provost three years later and
president in 1980.
   But Edward Carr, president of university's the Board of
Trustees, Monday issued a statement that said Berendzen was
stepping aside because of what Carr called allegations of
``improper behavior'' not connected with his role as president.
   Carr said Tuesday he had nothing to add, and Berendzen was in
hiding.

   Harry Helmsley, who avoided prosecution on
federal tax charges because he was found mentally incompetent, must
submit to a new test before a decision on similar state charges is
made.
   Gerald B. Lefcourt, attorney for the 81-year-old real estate
magnate, argued Monday in state court that there was ``no point''
to a new exam, and that the stress from it could endanger the life
of his client.
   But Justice John A.K. Bradley ordered him to make an appointment
immediately for an examination after prosecutors said that Helmsley
and his wife, Leona, recently had flown to Florida for a vacation.
   The exam was scheduled tentatively for May 9 and results are to
be submitted to the court May 23, said Leslie Gersing, a
spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office.
   The Helmsleys face state charges that they falsified $3 million
worth of business and tax records from 1982 to 1986.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, was convicted last year of federal income tax
fraud and sentenced to four years in prison, but is free on bond
pending appeal.

   Lady Bird Johnson, whose name has been synonymous
with highway beautification for decades, is bowing out of a state
landscape award program she has overseen for 20 years.
   The former first lady established and funded the Highway
Maintenance Foreman's Awards, which presented cash to highway
workers responsible for stretches of Texas roads judged to have the
best wildflowers, picnic areas and landscaping.
   Mrs. Johnson said she had accomplished much of what she intended
in the program and wants to spend more time with her family.
   ``I really and truly am tired, and to find open days and free
time, oddly enough, has become increasingly difficult,'' Mrs.
Johnson, 79, said in a recent letter to Bob Dedman, state highway
commission chairman.
   ``Second, after 20 years it seems to me that whatever
impression, impetus, enthusiasm for aesthetics along the highways _
whatever we can do _ has been done, if indeed it was do-able,''
wrote the first lady, whose campaign to improve roadside scenery
began in the early 1960s while her husband, Lyndon Johnson, was
president.
   State highway officials said they will try to continue the
program without Mrs. Johnson, using state funds to pay the prize
money to people responsible for the most beautiful stretch. The
winner receives $1,000 and the runner-up $500.

   Real estate tycoon Donald Trump is fishing for a
Japanese buyer for his Trump Princess, one of the world's most
luxurious yachts.
   Trump is asking $115 million for the yacht he bought three years
ago for a reported $29 million and then spent $9 million more
refurbishing.
   ``I think the prospects of finding a Japanese buyer are good,
especially if you consider recent Japanese purchases of works of
art,'' J. Jeffrey Walker, a Trump Organization senior vice
president, said Tuesday. ``We just need to find someone with the
right mentality.''
   The Princess, which arrived in Tokyo on Sunday, left its home
port in Atlantic City, N.J., four months ago. Along the way, the
282-foot yacht called in at Singapore, Taipei and Hong Kong.
   Trump is building a new 420-foot yacht to replace the Princess,
and Walker said the expected cost is more than $200 million.
   Buying the Trump Princess would make good business sense, Walker
said.
   ``If I were to call a meeting to discuss the Trump Organization
at a hotel, only a handful of people would come,'' Walker told
touring prospective buyers. ``If I have one here, everybody comes,
and they want to come again.''
   ``The price is too high, but there are many Japanese out there
with money to burn, so you never know,'' said Akio Kato, manager of
the Marine Sales and Project Development Department of
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries.

   Violinist Itzhak Perlman is giving
advice on restoration of a 64-year-old theater and concert hall.
   Perlman, who was stricken with polio at age 4 and wears leg
braces, is suggesting ways to make the theater accessible to
disabled people.
   Problems at the Garde Arts Center were apparent to Perlman when
he performed a benefit concert there with the Eastern Connecticut
Symphony in October.
   ``It's no secret that the Garde, built in 1926, has some
problems relating to access,'' restoration committee Chairman Carl
Stoner said Monday.
   Committee members met recently at Perlman's New York City
apartment to go over their master plan.
   ``He was so anxious to be a part of it, as though he was a
member of our committee,'' Stoner said.
   Committee member Steve Sigel said Perlman told group he is
always upset to see how theaters build a special ``Perlman ramp''
to accommodate him and then remove it the next day.
   ``He said they miss the point,'' Sigel said. ``The audience
needs to use this as much as the performer.''

   The Rev. Billy Graham has been released
from a hospital following surgery in which part of a rib was
removed to check for cancer, the Mayo Clinic said Tuesday. No
cancer was found.
   Graham was released Monday from St. Marys Hospital and will
continue as an outpatient at the Mayo Clinic for the next week or
two, the clinic said.
   Graham, 71, entered the Mayo Foundation hospital April 10 after
clinic doctors observed a rib lesion on X-rays taken several weeks
after he fell. Graham had complained of persistent pain in his left
rib cage and upper back. Surgery was performed April 11 to remove
part of the rib and check it for cancer.
   ``It is felt that the lesion was related to the fall, that he
had fractured a rib and that was part of the healing process,''
Mayo Clinic spokeswoman Nancy Skaran said Tuesday.
   Graham's doctors have recommended he limit his schedule for an
undetermined length of time, saying he needs complete rest,
followed by gradual exercise.
   ``He was already physically weakened prior to surgery as a
result of an exhaustive schedule which included two recent trips to
Berlin,'' the clinic said in a statement.
   ``Mr. Graham is deeply grateful for the many letters, telegrams,
cards and flowers he has received,'' the statement added.

<HEAD>Newspaper Publishers Told to Start Recycling to Avoid Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspaper publishers must move rapidly to
recycle newsprint to prevent the government from moving in and
imposing regulations, the chairman of a publishers' task force said
Tuesday.
   Frank A. Bennack Jr., president and chief executive officer of
the Hearst Corp., New York, offered a report on recycling in his
role as chairman of the American Newspaper Publishers Association
Newsprint Resource Task Force.
   In an address to the ANPA's 104th annual convention, Bennack
painted a grim picture of vanishing landfills to absorb the
nation's increasing output of solid waste.
   He said publishers have resolved to double the amount of
recycled newsprint used in the coming year, reaching a total of 4.6
million tons.
   Aggressive movement on recycling will prevent government
intervention, he said.
   ``We believe efforts to control newsprint can mean efforts to
control the press,'' he said. ``The prospect of dealing with a
regulated newsprint industry calls up an array of terrifying
unknowns.''
   Bennack said that at least two states have already mandated that
newspapers use recycled newsprint, but he insisted such official
orders will be unnecessary if publishers act on the recycling issue
voluntarily.
   He said 35 percent of newspapers currently are recycled, and
publishers aim to bring that up to 50 percent.
   ``Our goal must be reached if newspapers are to deal with the
irrevocable closing of landfills,'' he said.
   Bennack said the nation had 18,000 landfills available in 1979.
Today only 6,500 remain, and that figure will diminish to 4,200 by
1995, he said.
   ``In 15 to 20 years, the last existing landfills will be
closed,'' he said, ``but this society will be producing thousands
of tons of solid waste.''
   Bennack stressed that although newspapers are among the most
visible recyclable items, they make up only 8 percent of solid
waste going into landfills. He said newspapers already are the
second largest recycled material in the country.

<HEAD>Acquit 14 Ethnic Albanians in Yugoslav Political Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TITOVA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former Communist Party
chief of troubled Kosovo province and 13 other prominent ethnic
Albanians were acquitted Tuesday of inciting anti-government
protests.
   ``This is a victory for justice in Yugoslavia,'' said the
teary-eyed ex-party leader, Azem Vlasi, as he embraced his wife.
   The six-month political trial was Yugoslavia's biggest in
decades.
   Chief Judge Ismet Emra ruled lack of evidence. Public Prosecutor
Spasoje Zamfirovic indicated he would ask a retrial, Tanjug news
agency reported.
   Belgrade radio said thousands of ethnic Albanians celebrated the
43-year-old Vlasi's release, chanting ``Azem, Azem!'' and singing
nationalist songs, while minority Serbs in the province were
``shocked by the outcome of the trial.''
   The acquittal was seen as a setback for Serbian leader Slobodan
Milosevic, who pushed for holding the trial and for strong-arm
policies in Kosovo, which is part of the Serbian republic.
   Politicians and the news media in Yugoslavia's western republics
of Slovenia and Croatia denounced it as a ``show trial'' staged by
the Serbian leadership to intimidate Albanians in Kosovo. Human
rights groups also criticized the trial. Vlasi was arrested in
March 1989.
   Heavy riot police forces patrolled major towns in Kosovo late
Tuesday, fearing street celebrations could trigger intercommunal
clashes. The only incidents reported, however, was some minor
stone-throwing involving Vlasi supporters and police.
   A state of emergency imposed in Kosovo in March 1989 was lifted
this month, after Kosovo's police force came entirely under Serbian
control.
   The 14 defendants were originally accused of
counter-revolutionary activities for allegedly instigating a wave
of protests by ethnic Albanians in winter 1989. According to the
indictment, the protests culminated in an ``armed insurrection'' in
Kosovo that left numerous people dead.
   Last week, the charges were modified to remove the threat of
capital punishment.
   Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are a 90 percent majority, has
been rocked more than a year by violent protests over
constitutional amendments in Serbia that gave Yugoslavia's largest
republic almost complete control over the province. At least 60
people died in protests the past year.
   Kosovo previously enjoyed broad autonomy. The amendments were
said to be needed to protect Slavs in Kosovo from alleged
harassment by ethnic Albanians.
   During the trial, Vlasi denied charges he instigated the unrest
and claimed the trial was staged by Milosevic, his political
archrival.

   A smiling gunman who was released from a mental
hospital despite homicidal and suicidal tendencies opened fire in
the food court of a suburban shopping mall Tuesday, killing one man
and wounding four people.
   The man tried to reload the .38 caliber revolver but tossed it
into a trash can before calmly walking out and surrendering, police
said.
   James Calvin Brady, 31, surrendered to DeKalb County police
outside the mall just after shootings, said police spokesman Chuck
Johnson.
   ``He held up his hands and said, `I'm the one you're looking
for,''' said police Col. M.F. Ferguson.
   Police said Brady was charged Tuesday night with one count of
murder and four counts of aggravated assault. He was being held
without bond, and other charges may be filed.
   A document found in Brady's pocket said he was released Monday
from Georgia Regional Hospital in Atlanta. He was admitted to the
state hospital April 13, but the document did not say why he was
released, said DeKalb police Col. M.F. Ferguson.
   The document ``said he had homicidal and suicidal tendencies,
and suffered from delusions,'' Ferguson said. Brady ``can be
hostile, threatening, and has a history of alcohol abuse,'' he
quoted it as saying.
   Marchant Roach, a spokesman for the state Department of Human
Resources, which runs the state hospital system, said the
department would not comment on any patient.
   During questioning, police said Brady talked of God and about a
``mechanical device'' inside him that controls his actions.
   ``He's suffering from hallucinations. He was probably having one
when he fired,'' Ferguson said.
   Officers said Brady bought the revolver and 12 rounds of
hollow-point ammunition, a type designed to expand on impact and
cause particularly severe wounds, for $129 at a pawn shop in
Atlanta on Monday.
   ``He looked like a businessman with his left hand in his pants
pocket,'' said Carol Gravdahl, manager of Sweaters Etc. at
Perimeter Mall, a few miles north of the city. ``His right arm was
straight out with a pistol, shooting it off randomly. He was coming
around with it until I guess he emptied it _ and he was smiling.
   ``He just walked in and started shooting,'' she said. ``He was
very casual. He just stood there. He just moved his arm like
somebody would be picking out some people for a team _ you and you
and you and you.''
   After emptying his gun, Brady walked to a table, unloaded the
empty shells and was about to reload when an unidentified person
standing nearby talked him out of it, Johnson said.
   ``We still don't know who that person was,'' he said.
   DeKalb Public Safety Director Thomas Brown said the gunman
muttered, ``You don't know what all these people have done to me,''
as he was led away, but no motive had been established.
   ``We don't believe it was directed toward the individuals who
were shot; we think it was directed toward people in general,''
Brown said.
   A 24-year-old man was wounded in the chest and died later at
Northside Hospital, Johnson said. Police identified the man as
Michael Gregory Music of Norcross, an Atlanta suburb.
   Johnson said three people were taken to Shallowford Community
Hospital. Police identified them as:
   Craig E. Bruno, 23, of Roswell, shot in the abdomen and listed
in critical but stable condition.
   Lucille Huey, 74, of Decatur, wounded in the right side and
listed in critical but stable condition after surgery.
   Judy Shell, 53, of Roswell, shot in both legs and listed in
stable condition.
   James McDonald, 30, of Alpharetta, treated and released for a
gunshot wound to the ankle.
   Among the witnesses were two visitors from Soviet Georgia, here
on a Friendship Force exchange.
   ``We heard shooting, ... six times, seven times. ... I didn't
understand what was happening,'' said Tamriko Maisuradze, 39, who
was sitting in the food court with her husband, Alexander ``Kuchi''
Chubabira.
   ``My husband said, `Let's run.' ... Everybody was running.''

   President Bush will invoke emergency authority
to send $2.6 million in medical aid to Nicaragua in time for the
presidential inauguration Wednesday of Violeta Chamorro,
congressional and administration sources said.
   The move was timed to give Vice President Dan Quayle the chance
to deliver good news when he represents Bush at the swearing-in
ceremony in Managua, the sources said. Quayle also will report
progress toward sending previously promised food and other aid for
the new government, the sources said.
   Bush's request for $300 million to begin economic recovery in
Nicaragua, part of an $870 million aid request that also includes
Panama, had been stalled on Capitol Hill by a dispute over
unrelated legislation. That snarl was resolved late Tuesday, but it
remained unlikely the full aid package would be approved
immediately.
   Failure to approve the full aid package by Chamorro's
inauguration should not be seen as an embarrassment, said House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   ``It is a matter of procedures here,'' he told reporters. ``We
have procedures that obviously have to go forward, and I think
eventually that aid package will be voted.''
   The administration aid request for Nicaragua is designed to help
that country _ now among the poorest in the hemisphere _ recover
from a decade of civil war and U.S. trade sanctions. It includes
money to meet immediate needs for planting of crops and for fuel.
   Officials of the new government acknowledge they face a thorny
challenge in meeting the expectations of the electorate for a
better standard of living.
   Mrs. Chamorro was elected overwhelmingly in February elections
to replace President Daniel Ortega of the leftist Sandinista party.
Her coalition was supported by the United States.
   The medical assistance would be the first direct U.S. aid to the
Central American country in nine years, since President Reagan cut
off aid shortly after taking office in 1981.
   Bush is seeking $300 million as a first installment of aid for
the country, along with $500 million for Panama. But the aid
package, a version of which has been passed by the House, had been
held up in the Senate by a dispute over child-care legislation.
   The dispute was settled late Tuesday, and the Senate
Appropriations Committee approved the money measure with the full
$300 million for Nicaragua and $420 million for Panama, the same
amounts previously approved by the House.
   The panel voted 15-14 against an effort by Chairman Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., to cut the Panama aid
to $300 million and use the money saved to help U.S. businesses
compete in Eastern Europe.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he
expected the money measure to be on the Senate floor Wednesday, but
could not predict how long it would take to complete action.
   The Senate committee's version of the bill, totaling about $3.4
billion, also included domestic spending for programs like disaster
relief, the Census Bureau, food stamps and Head Start. And it
included $10 million for use if the United States wants to
establish an embassy in Lithuania.
   The measure was nearly $1 billion more expensive than the House
version, but also included larger cuts in Pentagon spending to pay
for the increase.
   Bush made the urgency of the supplemental money bill the top
item on his agenda when he met with congressional leaders at the
White House on Tuesday, participants said. House Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., said Bush sought to ``turn up the heat'' on
Mitchell to schedule action on the measure.
   Later, speaking to a group visiting the White House, Bush asked:
``If you have any spare time, please call your friendly senator and
tell them to get going and get this legislation passed. Because we
are a symbol up here for these countries in our own neighborhood.''
   The stopgap medical aid is being provided under a little-used
section of the foreign assistance law that permits the president to
use up to $10 million a year for ``any emergency purposes,'' so
long as Congress is notified. The administration began making those
notifications late Monday, the sources said.

<TEXT>
   Clifton Reginald Wharton, the first black
American to reach the rank of career minister and ambassador in the
U.S. Foreign Service, has died at the age of 90.
   The cause of death was not released.
   Wharton, who died Monday, rose through the ranks of the service
in his 40-year career and ultimately was appointed ambassador to
Norway under presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy.
   He also was an alternative representative of the United States
at the United Nations in the early 1960s.
   Wharton was the first black to be assigned as minister to a
non-black country, the first to attain the rank of career minister
and the first to become an ambassador through the career service.
   Born May 11, 1899, in Baltimore, he earned several degrees from
Boston University and was the first black to pass the Foreign
Service exam in 1925.
   He soon was appointed vice consul and second secretary in
Liberia.
   From 1930 to 1941, he served as consul in Las Palmas, Spain, and
from 1936 to 1942 held four temporary assigments to Liberia as
charge d'affaires.
   He went on to serve as a consul in Tananarive, Madagascar, a
maritime consul in the Azores, Portugal, and consul general and
first secretary in Lisbon.
   Eisenhower named Wharton envoy extraordinary and minister
plenipotentiary to Romania in 1958. Kennedy named him ambassador to
Norway in 1961, and he retired in 1964.
   He is survived by four children.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union said Tuesday that
economic problems will not be solved by rigid central control but
by encouraging market forces and guaranteeing social justice.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Ernest Y. Obminsky told a special
U.N. session on economic coperation that ``each country bears the
major responsibility for its own development.''
   His speech, on the second day of a six-day session on helping
sick Third World economies, was considered a major statement
reflecting Moscow's new views on liberalizing the Soviet economy
and coordinating foreign aid with market reforms in recipient
nations.
   Like speakers from industrialized and developing nations,
Obminsky struck a balance between the need for poor nations to
undertake economic restructuring and for better-off nations to help
them where they need it _ in debt relief, commodity prices,
inflation and trade.
   Because of the Soviet Union's own economic woes, Moscow is less
enthusiastic about pouring money into poor, leftist Third World
nations where the aid may be mismanaged under rigid, central
control.
   But Obminsky reaffirmed the Soviet Union's long-standing and
continuing commitment to helping less fortunate nations.
   He said that despite difficulties faced by the Soviet economy,
the government continues to provide major Third World aid.
   But he said awareness is growing that economic objectives may be
achieved most efficiently ``not through rigid centralization, but
rather through encouraging market mechanisms managed by economic
methods, while ensuring adequate social guarantees for the
population and equality of all forms of property.''
   In the Soviet Union, he said, the government is developing a new
package of laws to speed transition from a state-controlled economy
to a regulated market economy.
   He said Soviet plans include reform of the financial system and
the pricing system, establishment of commodity exhanges and
eventually, stock exchanges.
   On Monday, industrialized nations called upon the developing
world to bear the primary responsibility for galvanizing their own
stagnating economies, but said the West stands ready to deliver
major aid to market systems.
   Also at the United Nations on Tuesday:
   _Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan accused India
of using ``massive and indiscriminate'' force to suppress Moslem
secessionists in Kashmir and asked India to stop it. His statement
came on the eve of a meeting with Indian Foreign Minister Inder K.
Gujar to discuss the turmoil in Kashmir, claimed by both nations.
India is overwhelmingly Hindu.
   _The United States, Canada, the European Community and others
urged the Ethiopian government and rebels to observe an immediate
cease-fire to ensure distribution of food and prevent mass
starvation. Famine threatens an estimated 4.5 million Ethiopians in
northern Wollo, Tigre and Eritrea. Donor nations have committed
food aid, but civil war prevents supplies from reaching the people.
   _The Arab League condemned the U.S. congressional vote
recognizing a united Jerusalem as capital of Israel and called the
non-binding move ``reckless and irresponsible.''

   The ruling party said Tuesday it was
barring former President Daniel Oduber from politics for one year
for secretly taking a campaign donation from an American accused of
drug trafficking.
   Oduber was chairman of the party's national political committee
and one of Costa Rica's most influential figures. He was not
available for comment and aides said he was vacationing in Europe.
   The general secretary of the ruling National Liberation Party,
Walter Coto, said Oduber did not informed party authorities when
Lionel Casey donated $12,000 to a 1985 campaign fund.
   Casey, 65, from Miami, is in a San Jose jail awaiting
extradition to Florida on charges of drug trafficking.
   ``The party's ethics committee, after an investigation,
determined that ex-President Daniel Oduber is suspended for a year
from his functions and offices and as a representative of the
National Liberation Party,'' Coto said.
   Under party rules, Oduber, who served as president 1974-78,
should have informed the party leadership of the donation and
turned the money over to the party treasurer, Coto said.
   After serving a five-year term, Oduber was succeeded by fellow
party member, Oscar Arias. By law Oduber could not run for
re-election.
   Arias won the 1987 Nobel Prize for a Central American peace plan
and is scheduled to leave office May 8. He will be succeeded by
Rafael Calderon Fournier of the opposition United Social Christian
Party.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia's top religious body
announced Tuesday that the crescent moon heralding a new Moslem
month had not been sighted and the month of Ramadan fasting would
continue until Thursday.
   The decision by Saudi Arabia's ruling clerics has strong
influence in the Moslem world because of the prestigious place the
kingdom holds as home to the religion's holiest shrines in Mecca
and Medina.
   The delay means most of the world's estimated 1 billion Moslems
will end their monthlong dawn-to-dusk fast on Thursday, rather than
Wednesday as was expected.
   Islamic months end when a crescent moon can be sighted by eye.
The months can last 29 or 30 days.
   The fast month of Ramadan commemorates the time when Islamic
tradition holds that the Angel Gabriel gave the Moslem holy book,
the Koran, to the prophet Mohammed more than 14 centuries ago.
   In some countries, such as Iran and Egypt, Ramadan started a day
later and can be expected to end Thursday or Friday.

<TEXT>
   The Exxon Corp. pipeline that leaked
567,000 gallons of heating oil into a busy waterway between New
York and New Jersey had cracked a long time before the spill, state
officials said Tuesday.
   The report contradicted Exxon's contention that recent damage
caused the underwater pipe to burst and foul the Arthur Kill
waterway on Jan. 1. However, Exxon issued a statement Tuesday
saying the report confirmed its conclusions that the pipe had been
damaged and was not corroded.
   The state-commissioned study, conducted by Battelle Co. of
Columbus, Ohio, concluded that the pipe suffered a 10-foot dent ``a
substantial period of time before the final leak occurred.''
   The damaged pipe didn't rupture earlier because oil was pumped
through it at a relatively low pressure between Exxon facilities in
Bayonne and Elizabeth, the study said.
   Exxon's statement said the pipeline was pressure-tested four
times a year, the last time on Dec. 18, 1989.
   ``This type of rigorous test would have detected a small leak in
the line,'' the statement said.
   An Exxon spokesman said the company would have no further
comment.

   The man who built a bomb that maimed a
5-year-old girl at a K mart store a year ago committed suicide
within 36 hours of the blast, authorities said Tuesday.
   David L. Swinford, 19, shot himself in the head as he sat in a
car on a rural road on April 19, 1989, a few hours after having
discussed the bombing with his mother and stepfather, said Charles
Petersen, resident agent in charge of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms in Indianapolis.
   Swinford, who graduated from high school in 1988, was working at
a restaurant at the time of the bombing, Petersen said.
   Following disagreements, his parents had asked him to move out
of the home, he added.
   Petersen said authorities knew of no motive for the bombing.
   Swinford, of rural Noblesville, was identified as a possible
suspect within days of the April 17, 1989, bombing, but
investigators only recently developed conclusive evidence that he
built the device, Petersen said.
   Petersen said Swinford's stepfather, David Whitesell, contacted
authorities shortly after the suicide and suggested his stepson may
have been responsible for the blast that took off part of the left
hand of Erin Bower of Indianapolis.
   Erin, now 6, picked up the pump-type toothpaste dispenser in
which the pipe bomb had been concealed. She now wears an artificial
hand and was scheduled this month for a cornea transplant in her
left eye, also damaged in the explosion.
   Her father, Kevin Bower, released a statement Tuesday saying,
``If this individual was in fact responsible, Maureen and I feel
sorry for him and for the circumstances which must have been
present to lead to such an act. ...
   ``We would like to get all of this behind us and focus on what
lies ahead.''
   Petersen said there was no evidence about whether Swinford
actually placed the bomb on the shelf.
   ``He may have had an accomplice,'' he said.
   Tests on a screwdriver and knife recovered from Swinford's car
determined that they were used in making the bomb, Petersen said.
   He described the bomb as ``a very inventive device'' that was
filled with explosive black powder and BBs.
   Swinford knew about bomb-making and electrical wiring from
building crude firecracker devices with friends and from working
with his stepfather in electronic installation, Petersen said.
   ``Certainly he did not expect to hurt a young girl,'' Petersen
said of Swinford.
   K mart officials learned of Swinford's involvement recently from
ATF agents, said spokeswoman Leslie Kota at K mart headquarters in
Troy, Mich.
   ``It is obviously a very unfortunate set of circumstances all
the way around. It compounds the tragedy for both families,'' she
said.
   Kota said company officials had not decided what would happen to
the $20,000 reward K mart offered for information leading to the
arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing.
   Separate rewards totaling $30,000 also had been offered.

   Gen. Humberto Ortega, one of the
leaders of the Sandinista revolution, will remain as commander of
the Nicaraguan army after President-elect Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro is sworn in Wednesday, a source in the incoming government
said Tuesday.
   ``There are some extremists who want the Sandinistas wiped out
in one fell swoop,'' the source close to Mrs. Chamorro said,
describing some factions in the United National Opposition. ``That
can't be. He (Ortega) will be eased out, but not for a while.''
   The plan calls for keeping Gen. Ortega as commander in chief of
the army and Mrs. Chamorro as defense minister, said the source,
who refused to be identified by name.
   The retention of Gen. Ortega, President Daniel Ortega's brother,
as army commander was likely to heighten divisions inside Mrs.
Chamorro's coalition and make it more difficult for her to persuade
the U.S.-backed Contra rebels to disarm.
   The Contras and members of the Chamorro coalition have demanded
the army be purged of Sandinista loyalists.
   ``It is unacceptable that members representative of the FSLN
(Sandinista Front) remain in high-level posts in the army, Interior
Ministry and other government structures,'' UNO's political council
said in a statement Tuesday. The council has frequently been at
odds with the circle of Chamorro advisers putting her government
together.
   That statement continued, ``If the executive were to take a
decision opposite to the previous statement, the political council
will not support such a decision nor accept responsibility for the
consequences.''
   According to the source, Gen. Ortega will remain in charge of
the army but answer to Mrs. Chamorro, who as both defense minister
and president will be supreme commander of the armed forces.
   Mrs. Chamorro will keep the defense ministry post ``until an
appropriate person can be found to take over,'' the source said.
   That jibed with a leak in La Prensa, the Chamorro family
newspaper, which said Monday that Mrs. Chamorro would take the
defense post.
   Gen. Ortega was one of the most prominent members of the
Sandinista party's national directorate until he quit Monday in
accordance with an agreement to depoliticize the armed forces.
   The nine-man directorate, which included both Ortega brothers,
had not changed its membership since the Sandinistas overthrew
dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   All officers in the Sandinista People's Army and the security
forces resigned leadership positions in the Sandinista Front,
presumably making them eligible to stay on after Mrs. Chamorro
takes over.

   Despite their apparent help in liberating
American hostage Robert Polhill, Iran and Syria will remain on the
State Department's list of countries that sponsor terrorism, U.S.
officials say.
   Remaining on the terrorism list means Iran and Syria will
continue to be deprived of U.S. backing for international bank
loans and sophisticated American technology.
   The department's annual terrorism report is due to be released
next Monday. It was finished two weeks ago, before Polhill was
freed by the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.
   The report could have been revised. But a U.S. official said,
speaking Monday on condition of anonymity, ``we are not calling it

Bolivia, U.S. officials say.
   The $35 million aid package with Peru was announced over the
weekend in Lima and will involve the Peruvian military in the
anti-drug effort for the first time.
   Negotiations with the three Andean countries have taken place
since shortly after President Bush announced his anti-drug strategy
last September and disclosed his intention to increase military
cooperation with each country.
   Consistent with earlier announcements, the Colombian program
will be $40.3 million and Bolivia's will be $33.7 million. The U.S.
officials, who insisted on anonymity, said the signings of the
agreements are imminent.

<HEAD>Peter Jennings Revists the Killing Fields of Cambodia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On this month 15 years ago, Phnom Penh fell to
Khmer Rouge troops. Thirteen days later, Saigon surrendered to
North Vietnamese forces. The Vietnam War was over.
   But as an ABC News special coming up Thursday reminds us, the
Khmer Rouge's takeover of Cambodia marked the beginning of a
murderous four-year reign of terror in which an estimated one
million Cambodians were killed.
   The Vietnamese drove the Khmer Rouge out, but fighting
continues. Guerrillas from a coalition of two non-communist groups
and the communist Khmer Rouge are battling those of Cambodia's
government.
   Reported by Peter Jennings, ABC's special, ``From the Killing
Fields,'' examines if the United States, in supporting that
anti-government alliance, might be helping the Khmer Rouge come
back.
   Jennings, anchorman of the top-rated ``World News Tonight,''
spent a week in January traveling to Cambodia and Vietnam for the
special.
   He also flew to Beijing for an interview with the nominal head
of the anti-government coalition, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the
former Cambodian ruler whose overthrow in 1970 by American-backed
forces was followed five years later by the Khmer Rouge takeover.
   ``I found him to be sad in some cases, very defensive on other
issues,'' the anchorman said. ``When I asked him about the
conventional wisdom that he's a puppet of the Khmer Rouge, he
became extremely defensive. He said he's in charge.''
   Jennings' Vietnam trip was his first since 1965, when he was on
his first tour as anchorman of ABC's weeknight newscasts. He was a
veritable kid then as anchors go, sent for two months to cover the
early part of the long U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.
   His dossier now is full of foreign-correspondent credits. But on
his first time in Vietnam, he candidly says, he didn't really know
much about the subject and was ``more than a dilettante than
anything else.''
   Still, his return to Vietnam contained its share of deja vu
experiences, softened by time and nature.
   When he flew from Bangkok over Cambodia and Vietnam to what now
is Ho Chi Minh City, Jenning said, he found that from the air, the
only visible remnants of the war ``are the craters left by B-52
bombings.''
   ``They're all over the place, some filled with water, some
planted (with rice),'' he said.
   He also took a drive that would have been a suicide run during
the war, motoring up Route One from Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh,
passing through the so-called Parrot's Beak area 30 miles west of
Vietnam's capital.
   A battleground during the war, it's quiet now, he said, and
``you can walk around there day and night'' without fear. Not so
the so-called ``liberated zones'' of the Cambodian guerrillas near
the Thai border.
   ``All the fighting is being done on the western side of the
country,'' said Jennings, whose Cambodian travels took him to Khmer
Rouge-controlled refugee camps and two contested border towns,
Sisophon and Batdambang.
   He shook his head when asked if any Cambodian with whom he spoke
in Phnom Penh mentioned the 1984 movie that dramatized the bloody
nightmare of the Khmer Rouuge takeover, ``The Killing Fields.''
   ``No, they'd been through the real ones,'' he said. ``We're
fortunate, however, in the fact that a great many Americans saw the
movie.''
   That may give many viewers ``a base of knowledge'' for
understanding Thursday's special, he said: ``I think people know
the Khmer Rouge have the title of the worst barbarians since the
Nazis.''
   The special, shown in the same week as Time magazine's cover
story on Vietnam and Cambodia, marks the second time this year ABC
and Time have simultaneously done major stories on the same subject.
   The double coverage is the result of an informal agreement by
the two organizations, although the ABC and Time stories are
journalistically separate efforts, says Tom Yellin, executive
producer of ABC's special.
   Time and ABC are, however, collaborating on a live follow-up
forum, anchored by Jennings, that ABC will broadcast at 11:30 p.m.
EDT after the special.
   Scheduled guests on the 90-minute forum include Sen. Bob Kerrey,
D-Neb., a Vietnam veteran and Medal of Honor recipient who recently
visited Cambodia.
   Henry Kissinger, a key figure in President Nixon's Cambodia
policy during the war, also was to have appeared, ``but he's just
dropped out for reasons that apparently have nothing to do with
us,'' Yellin said Monday.

   The two major U.S. Spanish-language
television networks are Americanizing their programming with lively
new shows in a battle for increasing Hispanic viewership and
advertising dollars.
   Telemundo and Univision officials say the push for new programs,
many patterned after popular English-language shows, coincides with
a surge in Spanish television viewers in major markets,
particularly Los Angeles.
   The programming is a fresh alternative to the time-honored
mainstays of Spanish television: melodramatic soap operas _ or
novelas _ shoot-em'-up Mexican movies and Sunday variety shows.
   This year alone, Univision has introduced ``Fama y Fortuna (Fame
and Fortune),'' a ``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'' clone;
``Cita con el Amor (A Date With Love),'' a Hispanic version of
``The Dating Game;'' and ``Cristina,'' a talk-show takeoff of Oprah
Winfrey.
   The network also began airing a talk show featuring Hispanic
comedian Paul Rodriguez in March.
   Telemundo has countered with a MTV-produced rock video program
in Spanish and a variety of new game shows _ ``Uno Nunca Sabe (One
Never Knows),'' a ``Candid Camera''-style game show; ``Adivinelo
con Senas (Guess It With Signs),'' a charades game show featuring
two teams of celebrities; and ``La Feria de la Alegria (The Fair of
Happiness),'' a variety and game show featuring an assortment of
contests and entertainment.
   The push comes at a crucial time, particularly for cash-strapped
Univision, which in February was unable to make interest payments
of about $10 million due on $270 million in junk bonds it had
issued.
   Hallmark Cards Inc., which owns 63.5 percent of Univision,
earlier this year had offered to pay $131 million for the bonds. It
said at least 90 percent of each issue must be tendered before it
would be obligated to buy any of the securities, and that Univision
was authorized to file for bankruptcy if the tender offer was not
successful.
   Hallmark announced on April 17 that it was dropping that
requirement of the offer and had accepted $251.9 million of the
bonds for payment, averting the possibility of bankruptcy.
   A recent Los Angeles Arbitron survey showed Spanish television
viewership jumped 52 percent in February from the same month the
previous year, according to Maureen Schultz, audience research
manager for KMEX, Univision's Los Angeles affiliate.
   Hispanics now make up about 28.5 percent of Los Angeles-area
residents, and Hispanic households account for about 21.4 percent
of all Los Angeles-area households with televisions, according to
research figures from both networks.
   Nationwide, there now are more than 20 million Hispanics,
accounting for nearly 10 percent of the country's total population,
network officials said.
   ``Our 1990 programming lineup, coupled with the rapidly growing
Hispanic population _ which is increasing five times more rapidly
than the general population _ will make advertisers stand up and
take note,'' said Rosita Peru, a Univision vice president and
programming director.
   Along with new network programs, local affiliates have beefed up
news coverage in an attempt to attract new viewers and develop
viewer loyalty. For national and international news coverage,
Univision depends on its own correspondents, and Telemundo
contracts with CNN for specially prepared Spanish programming.
   An especially competitive news war has erupted in Los Angeles,
where Univision affiliate KMEX goes head-to-head with Telemundo
affiliate KVEA.
   ``It really is very competitive,'' said KVEA spokesman Martin
Quiroz. ``That's what makes it fun and what forces us to do
better.''
   Both stations have new general managers and news directors.
   ``News sets the station's whole image,'' said KMEX General
Manager Emilio Nicolas Jr.
   Univision officials hope a new multimedia service launched in
late March, which Telemundo is not involved with, will help more
advertisers reach the Spanish-speaking market by magazine,
television and telephone.
   Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., said 90 percent of
the $10 million advertising time and space for one year had been
sold when the new service was started.
   Whittle has predicted the new service will reach an estimated
500,000 Hispanic magazine readers and nearly 90 percent of Hispanic
homes with televisions. Sponsors include American Airlines, Procter
&amp; Gamble, AT&amp;T and Kinney Shoes.

   Bill Totten says he is proof that foreigners can
crack the Japanese market with the same formula that works
elsewhere: hard work and concern for customers.
   But the computer software executive says those who succeed
generally keep quiet, not wanting to invite competition.
   Totten, in contrast, has been contributing articles to major
newspapers and magazines overseas and appearing on Japanese
television to challenge the commonly held belief that Japan is a
closed market.
   ``My experience has been that this has been a very open
country,'' contends the American, who has lived in Tokyo 21 years
and speaks Japanese.
   Far from encountering any trade barriers, he says, ``I've found
it easier to do this business in Japan than to do it in my own
country or for a Japanese to do it here.''
   He is president of one of Japan's largest software firms, K.K.
Ashisuto, which reported sales of more than $59 million in 1989 and
claims a 50 percent share of the independent software market.
   ``Go talk to Coca-Cola, who sells 70 percent of the soft drinks
sold here in Japan, and find out what bad things they say about
Japan. Go talk to Du Pont and ask what their complaints are. Schick
sells 70 percent of the razors sold in the country. Do they
bad-mouth the Japanese?,'' he said in an interview.
   Totten arrived in 1969 as the representative for a U.S. software
company. But after its headquarters rebuffed his attempts to sell
packaged software to the Japanese, he quit and started his own firm
with two Japanese partners in 1972.
   Totten says he never studied much about doing business with the
Japanese. But he has sweated to make all his products usable in the
Japanese language and adapted them to Japanese tastes.
   The 6-foot-4 American puts in 12 hours at work most days and
calls on hundreds of customers a year.
   Last fall, Totten's firm plunged into the market for personal
computer software with five packages at $60 each, a fraction of the
cost of competing brands. More than 160,000 packages have been
sold, and all five types are on the best-seller lists.
   Totten, who so far has been mainly distributing American-made
software after adapting it for the Japanese market, says he fears
that the U.S. software industry may be beginning to lose its edge.
   Ashisuto revenues' dependence on imports from the United States
fell from 99 percent in 1988 to 95 percent last year, and is
expected to decline to 80 percent this year, he says.
   Totten says American firms have refused to spend time adapting
or marketing their products in Japan, and are getting pushed out by
a new generation of high-quality Japanese products.
   U.S. and Japanese government negotiators have been busy in
recent months in talks on opening Japan's market wider to American
supercomputers, satellites and forest products, and on changing
deep-seated business practices.
   Japan has promised, among other things, to make it easier to
open large stores in Japan, spend more on public works, pressure
corporate groups to reduce the emphasis on personal ties in making
purchasing decisions, and try to solve soaring land costs.
   To Totten, however, such trade frictions only reflect ``two
silly governments fighting with each other.'' He says private
citizens should become involved before the two countries are at
each others' throats.
   ``I consider both countries my country. I love the United States
and I love Japan,'' he says.
   On one hand, he adds, ``I would not want to see the U.S. lose
its software industry out of ignorance or silly mistakes, and I'm
trying to talk to my friends in the industry that we've got to
correct things.''
   On the other, ``I have two children who speak only Japanese. I
want the Japanese economy to remain a healthy economy for my
children.''

<HEAD>Austrians Keep Non-Communist Hammer and Sickle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist symbols are vanishing from
Eastern Europe, but Austria is keeping its hammer and sickle, which
had nothing to do with communism in the first place.
   Because neighboring nations in what used to be called the Soviet
bloc have been stripping wheat sheaves, red stars and other
Communist symbols from their coats of arms, the question also arose
in Austria.
   In 1919, Austrian legislators met in Vienna to create a republic
from the ruins of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. They adopted a coat
of arms in which the Austrian eagle expressed commitment to the
common man by holding a hammer, for workers, and a sickle, for
farmers, in its claws.
   In 1945, Parliament voted to add broken shackles dangling from
the eagle's legs, symbolize release from Nazi domination.
   The debate about what to do now has been spirited, both in
Parliament and outside.
   Popular sentiment appears to be against removing the implements
from the eagle's claws. Of 24 letters from readers printed by the
mass-circulation tabloid Kurier in March, only five were in favor.
   Josef Riegler, one of the five, said: ``Even during my first
visits abroad after World War II ... I was often asked whether the
Soviet occupiers had forced us to include the hammer and sickle in
our state emblem. I heard similar questions later from visitors to
Vienna.''
   Some of those opposed to change expressed anger at what they
considered an attempt by politicans to magnify a small issue.
   Others, like Brigitte Michalko, were defiant. ``Those who
considered us Communists up to now because of our coat of arms can
continue to do so as far as I care,'' she wrote.
   The broken chains added in 1945 added to the existing confusion.
Some saw them as an echo of the Communist Manifesto, which exhorts
the proletariat to rise because ``you have nothing to lose but your
chains.''
   In February, the right-leaning Freedom Party began efforts in
Parliament to discard, at least, the hammer and sickle.
   They are ``symbols for contempt of humanity, death camps and
suppression,'' the party's resolution declared. If they remained on
the national emblem, it said, Austria would be the only
non-communist country in Europe ``whose state symbol symbolizes
communism.''
   Although the measure received wide publicity, it initially was
considered more symbolic than serious. The Freedom Party has only
18 members in the 183-seat chamber and few people thought the
motion would receive the necessary two-thirds vote.
   The issue gained extra weight when a group of legislators from
the Austrian People's Party, partner with the Socialists in the
governing coalition, presented a similar motion.
   Sides were taken. The People's Party split on the issue and the
Socialists opposed any change.
   Felix Ermacora, a sponsor of the People's Party motion, said in
an interview that changing the emblem ``could avoid
misunderstandings abroad.''
   ``There is the occasional misconception when people look at our
coat of arms on our passports, for instance, and see the hammer and
sickle,'' he said.
   People's Party spokesman Anton Wressnig said the action by
Ermacora's group was independent. Changing the emblem is ``not an
official concern'' of the party, he said in a telephone interview,
and described the issue as ``relatively unimportant.''
   Heinz Fischer, a senior Socialist Party official, said: ``If we
didn't change it in 1956 and 1968, there is no no need to do it
now.''
   Soviet invasions crushed an ant-Stalinist uprising in Hungary in
1956 and a reform movement in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

<HEAD>Three Major African Nations Committed to One-Party Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tide of democracy sweeping Eastern
Europe is being felt in black Africa, but one-party rule still
predominates and three of the major states have publicly committed
themselves to it.
   Tanzania has had only one party for 26 years and said this month
the policy will not change. Kenya did the same and Zimbabwe's
leader, Robert Mugabe, declared his intention to install one-party
rule.
   ``If we have many political parties, we will have chaos as
different tribes rush to form theirs,'' President Daniel arap Moi
of Kenya told trainee teachers at Laikipia in central Kenya.
``Tribal inclinations and consciousness is still paramount in the
minds of many Kenyans.''
   ``For now, I say no to the multiparty system, at least until we
are cohesive enough as a nation,'' he said.
   Kenya has 40 tribes in a population of 22 million. Ethnic
feuding is common in Parliament, at public rallies and in the press.
   Moi, a 66-year-old a former teacher from the minority Kalenjin
tribe, inherited the one-party system in 1978 from the late
President Jomo Kenyatta, the nation's founder. Kenyatta had banned
opposition parties nine years earlier.
   Kenyatta created a de facto one-party state by locking up his
political opponents. Moi made it constitutional in 1982.
   The president's statement was his first on the subject since
some other African states began considering more liberalized
political systems this year.
   He spoke after weeks of debate in Nairobi newspapers about
whether Kenya should restore the style of democracy bequeathed to
Kenyatta when he led the former British colony to independence in
1963.
   Writers supporting the status quo argued that Kenya had
prospered under the current system, without tribal strife. They
said a return to the old order might cause ethnic violence and
drive away tourists and investors.
   Those who wanted change said Kenyans were politically mature
enough for competition, that recent reforms in eastern Europe
should be used as an example and that a parliamentary opposition
would help check official corruption, mismanagement and nepotism.
   Neighboring Tanzania, a nation of 100 tribes, also was a British
colony until independence in 1961 under Julius Nyerere.
   Unlike its wealthy capitalist cousin, Tanzania followed
socialism based on Eastern European models. Both Nyerere and Ali
Hassan Mwinyi, who succeeded him as president in 1985, have
admitted the policies were flawed.
   Mwinyi, 65, has adopted radical economic reforms prescribed by
Western lenders, but has rejected suggestions that they be
accompanied by political change.
   ``While a multiparty system would be suitable for Europeans, it
might not be the same with Tanzania,'' Mwinyi told reporters in Dar
es Salaam.
   ``What Africans want is a fair return for their sweat through a
new international economic order. ... This cannot be solved by the
creation of 100 parties, which can bring chaos instead of
progress.''
   He said Tanzanians had voted consistently for a single party as
a way to guarantee national unity. He did not mention a statement
Nyerere made in February that multiparty democracy now may be
possible.
   Nyerere, still chairman of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi Party,
remains a powerful political figure five years after he resigned as
president.
   Only a few of the 50 member nations of the Organization of
African Unity have Western-style democracies.
   Zimbabwe is one, but President Robert Mugabe declared after an
overwhelming victory in recent national elections that he will
transform the former British colony of Rhodesia into a one-party
state.
   Mugabe, who led Zimbabwe to independence 10 years ago, said the
elections were a mandate from the 4.8 million registered voters to
get rid of the opposition.
   His opponents accused Mugabe, 66, of seeking a dictatorship.
They noted that only 54 percent of the electorate voted and
opposition parties got 20 percent of the votes, although they won
only three of the 150 Parliament seats.
   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire said this week he would lift
a 20-year-old ban on opposition parties and his Popular Movement
for the Revolution, since 1970 the only official party, no longer
would have special status.
   He said the constitution of the former Belgian colony would be
rewritten and an interim government would be installed by April 24,
1991, to prepare for elections.
   Benin, a former French colony, is pledged to eliminate one-party
rule, Gabon is debating the question and there is pressure in the
Ivory Coast for a freer political order.
   Cameroon and Niger, scenes of recent political upheavals, have
rejected multiparty politics.
   Significant signals of change are coming from unlikely quarters.
   Ethiopia and Mozambique have abandoned their hardline Marxist
ideologies, and the Marxist leaders of Angola have committed
themselves to peace talks with U.S.-backed guerrillas that, if
fruitful, could lead to open elections.

   Frustrated by U.S. regulatory delays, Sir James
Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments Ltd. ended its acrimonious
nine-month takeover battle for the British conglomerate BAT
Industries PLC.
   The decision announced Monday marks a major defeat for
Goldsmith, whose group's $22 billion all-securities offer for BAT
would have been the world's second-largest takeover after the $25
billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. last year.
   BAT, whose U.S. companies include the Saks Fifth Avenue
department stores, has been restructuring by selling its retailing
and paper businesses to concentrate on tobacco and financial
services.

   Michael Milken won't face government questioning
until after he is sentenced for securities felonies, but experts
said they expect the financier's role in the multibillion-dollar
thrift crisis to be a hot topic.
   A hearing was set for today before U.S. District Judge Kimba
Wood at which Milken was expected to plead guilty to six criminal
counts and promise to pay $600 million to settle the biggest
financial fraud case in history.
   Milken agreed to the plea deal Friday after more than three
years at the center of a highly publicized and contentious assault
on Wall Street crime that began in 1986.

Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. was ``well positioned'' to return to
profitability.
   Shearson last week reported a $915 million first-quarter loss _
the largest in securities industry history _ in large part to pay
for 2,000 layoffs and business cuts initiated by American Express.
American Express lost $620 million in the first three months of
1990 because of the troubles at Shearson.
   ``It's the price we paid to put Shearson's major problems behind
us,'' Robinson told shareholders at American Express' annual

   General Motors Corp. said it plans to close a
Pontiac, Mich., truck plant in 1993, moving production to New
Jersey and potentially putting 2,300 people out of work.
   GM said Monday it planned in late 1992 to move assembly of newly
redesigned two-and four-door S-trucks, now called Chevrolet Blazer
and GMC Jimmy, from the Pontiac West plant to the Linden, N.J.,
plant, which makes its popular Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta cars.
   The automaker is shifting production because the 1.8
million-square-foot Pontiac West plant does not have enough
assembly space to keep up with anticipated demand for four-door
models, a GM spokeswoman said.

   Government food scientists looking for a healthier
way to satisfy forbidden cravings said they have created the
ultimate in guilt-free desserts _ oat bran ice cream.
   Actually, calling it ice cream is stretching it a bit, for it
has none of the fat-filled cream that is an essential ingredient of
the real thing. Instead, it gets its creamy consistency from a
tasteless, fat-like gel that's made entirely from oats.
   Its principal creator, George E. Inglett, calls this secret
ingredient Oatrim. He said it could take the place of fat in many
cold foods.

   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.80
percent on April 9, and six-month bills averaged 7.92 percent on

   Michael Milken's plea bargain resolves his
securities fraud charges, but it remains unclear to what extent the
junk bond pioneer will have to help federal investigators uncover
other white-collar crime.
   Milken heads to court today for a proceeding at which he is
expected to plead guilty to six criminal counts and agree to pay
$600 million to settle the biggest financial fraud case ever
brought against an individual.
   The former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. executive approved the
plea deal Friday after more than three years at the center of a
highly publicized and contentious assault on Wall Street crime that
began in 1986.
   Milken, 43, had staunchly maintained his innocence, but reversed
course in the face of a threatened new government indictment
replacing the 98 fraud and racketeering counts brought in March
1989. Sources have said the plea includes no insider trading or
racketeering charges.
   In an arrangement unusual for a major figure in the Wall Street
fraud crackdown, Milken will not be required to provide
investigators with information to build cases against other figures
as part of the plea bargain, sources said.
   Rather, he will be questioned by federal officials after
sentencing, an individual familiar with the deal confirmed Monday.
That arrangement would reduce the government's leverage by making
it impossible for prosecutors to recommend a stiffer prison term if
Milken does not cooperate.
   However, the government still could control his prison
conditions or parole date if investigators were unsatisifed with
his help. If he refused to testify under immunity before a grand
jury, Milken could face contempt charges.
   While the nature of Milken's future cooperation remains unclear,
observers said the government was likely to seek details about
extensive and possibly unlawful links with the nation's savings and
loans.
   Milken controlled a complex network of thrifts and corporate
clients that bought and sold each other's bonds, financed deals and
made investments together. Thrifts were among Drexel's largest junk
bond customers.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, the House Banking
Committee and the Resolution Trust Corp., which is charged with
rescuing the nation's thrifts, are examining savings and loan
failures expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions.
   SEC Enforcement Director William McLucas declined to comment on
the reported Milken settlement. He did say the commission has
formed a unit on thrift and banking that is examining compliance
with securities laws.
   Asked what area Milken is most likely to be questioned about,
John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law professor at Columbia
University, said, ``I think it would chiefly be the savings and
loan people because the government would love to get the S&amp;Ls.''
   The government isn't likely to get much useful information
because of the terms of the deal, Coffee said.
   He suggested the government may have agreed to the ``cosmetic
cooperation'' in order to obtain the plea and save face following a
series of light sentences in related Wall Street cases. Milken is
expected to receive about five years in prison, although he faces
up to 28 years.
   ``I think the government wants to offset these rather equivocal
Pyrrhic victories with a final round that shows this was a true
crime,'' Coffee said.
   He said the government may have been willing to trade away
Milken's assistance in nabbing other Drexel and Wall Street figures
in exchange for his guilty plea because ``they're Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern off in the wings and he's Hamlet.''
   The plea deal leaves unresolved charges against former Drexel
trader Bruce Newberg, who was named in the original 98-count
indictment, and cases against individuals who were expected to be
named in a new indictment.

<HEAD>Valdez Spill On Minds Of Exxon Shareholders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Valdez oil spill returns to haunt Exxon Corp.
Wednesday when shareholders vote on a six resolutions calling for
America's largest oil company to be more sensitive to the
environment.
   The company _ whose public image has been blackened by the
Alaskan spill and numerous other accidents in the last year _
opposes all the proposals, saying it already has taken steps to
increase awareness and responsiveness.
   Not so, said Anne Chapman, a shareholder in Denver who wants the
company to report annually on its environmental performance.
   ``I don't think they've learned much at all, and I hope that at
the shareholders meeting that it will come home to them that there
are people who really care,'' Mrs. Chapman said from her home in
Denver.
   Wednesday's meeting in Houston is the first chance shareholders
have had to present Valdez-related proposals, although the spill
dominated last year's four-hour meeting attended by some 2,000
shareholders and another 250 demonstrators outside.
   That meeting was held less than one month after the Exxon Valdez
ran aground in Prince William Sound, spilling 11 million gallons of
crude in the nation's worst oil spill.
   Altruism isn't the only factor motivating the shareholder
proposals.
   Reducing toxic chemical emissions ``is in the best interests of
Exxon management and Exxon shareholders ... not only from an
environmental and community relations standpoint, but from the
financial and legal liability that toxic and pollution-related
incidents could bring to the company and its shareholders,'' says
one proposal.
   Another resolution calls on Exxon to create an environmental
affairs committee of directors to show the company's high-level
concern in hopes of reducing any corporate liability.
   Other proposals would have Exxon:
   _Hold to its pledge to clean up Prince William Sound and ``show
real leadership'' in dealing with the damage.
   _Follow the Valdez Principles, established by a coalition of
institutional investors, setting out corporate environmental goals
and policies.
   _Reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
   Exxon rejects the resolutions as duplicative and unnecessary.
   ``The corporation's longstanding policy is to adhere to all
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that are
applicable to its business,'' Exxon says in its proxy statement.
   There also are four proposals involving shareholders' rights or
doing business in South Africa or Northern Ireland.
   ``Generally, I would like them to be responsible for their
actions and to know there are shareholders who care more about
integrity and responsibility than total profit,'' said Mrs.
Chapman, who wants Exxon to report annually on all measurable
hazardous emissions and include a hazardous risk assessment.
   ``Profit is important, but it is not the be-all and end-all,''
she said.
   Most of the proposals come from individuals. However, state
pension funds from California, Massachusetts and New York City
recently sought assurances from Exxon that company would protect
its earnings by taking steps to prevent another disaster like the
Valdez spill. The funds' holdings account for slightly more than 1
percent of Exxon's outstanding shares.
   The company on Monday said net earnings for the first three
months of this year fell 29.3 percent to $1.81 billion, or $1.41 a
share. The decline reflected a big, one-time gain from an
accounting change in the first quarter of 1989. Revenues rose 20.3
percent to $26.7 billion from $22.2 billion.
   Exxon's profit dropped 34 percent to $3.5 billion for all of
1989 because of the $2 billion it spent on the Valdez spill.
   Some environmentalists have accused Exxon of meeting in Houston
in search of friendly ground and hoping to avoid some of last
year's demonstrators.
   Exxon officials deny that, pointing out that Exxon's domestic
subsidiary is based in Houston and the city is home to many
employees and shareholders. Previous meetings in Houston drew 1,300
in 1986 and about 1,200 in 1981.
   Criticism of Exxon has continued since last year's meeting,
especially after the company cut back cleanup efforts during the
winter.
   Exxon also has been indicted on two felony charges and three
misdemeanors stemming from the Valdez spill; has further blackened
its image through numerous smaller spills and other accidents,
including a refinery explosion; announced it was moving its
headquarters from New York City to a Dallas suburb; and been the
focus of numerous media reports of low morale in the executive
suite.

   President Bush's chief economic adviser
says a ``peace dividend'' will help automakers and other
manufacturers meet the high costs of clean-air legislation,
although they won't see the money directly.
   Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers,
said the administration is trying to quash some proposed clean-air
requirements, such as a severe clampdown on auto tailpipe
emissions, that it thinks would hurt the economy more than clear
the air.
   Even so, he said, costs of pending clean-air legislation will
top $20 billion a year nationally.
   ``There will be job losses because of this bill, and there will
be some economic dislocation,'' Boskin said Monday in an address to
the Economic Club of Detroit.
   But the economy as a whole will be healthy, he predicted.
   ``While we're keeping a wary eye on inflation to make sure we
don't let the genie out of the bottle, we do believe ... inflation
will abate as we move forward in the next several months,'' Boskin
said. ``We also believe that over the course of the year, it is
likely that interest rates will abate.''
   Interest rates would have eased sooner except for the dramatic
changes in Eastern Europe and demand for capital to rebuild the
former communist bloc countries, Boskin said.
   The relaxing of political tension has let the administration
budget for a reduction in military spending of 2 percent a year, or
a total of 10 percent over the next five years, Boskin said.
   The top priority for those funds will be cutting the federal
deficit, he said.
   The administration considers that the best way, in the long run,
to help automakers and other manufacturers faced with big spending
to meet pollution controls and improve productivity, he said.
   ``It's a lot easier to do that if interest rates and the cost of
capital are down,'' Boskin said. ``A substantial reduction in the
budget deficit will help accomplish that _ make it much more
affordable for American industry to retool and upgrade and enhance
its productivity.''

<TEXT>
   United Airlines is counting on a well-known
Chicago commodity _ political clout _ to help it fend off
arch-rival American Airlines in a battle for non-stop jet service
from Chicago to Tokyo.
   The U.S. Department of Transportation is scheduled to start
hearings today to pick six new U.S.-to-Japan air routes.
   On Monday, United boasted that its bid was supported by five
state governors, two state congressional delegations and the
Nebraska Legislature _ all in the interest of better service for
their constituents.
   American countered that endorsements from politicians should not
be important. The Dallas-based carrier says it should be awarded
the route to preserve and nurture competition in the airline
industry.
   The contested route is between Washington's Dulles International
Airport and Tokyo, with a stop at Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport.
   United said in a statement that its supporters had written to
John J. Mathias, a Transportation Department administrative law
judge.
   Mathias will conduct hearings expected to result by Oct. 1 in
the selection of six new U.S. ``gateways'' for non-stop flights to
Japan.
   A gateway is a departure point for a non-stop flight. Chicago
would be the U.S. gateway for the contested flight.
   American has applied for a total of six different routes linking
U.S. and Japanese cities, said Barry Clark, manager of American's
international route strategy.
   United spokesman Joe Hopkins said United is concentrating on
only one route. The tussle amounts to an all-out effort by the
hometown carrier to block American, which recently pulled ahead of
United as the nation's biggest airline.
   ``We're putting all of our efforts into this one,'' Hopkins said.
   United is based near Chicago in Elk Grove Village.
   American, a subsidiary of Dallas-based AMR Corp., exceeded
United in sales and market share last year to become the biggest
U.S. carrier.
   American has made O'Hare the hub for its extensive European
connections. And the airline has been advertising aggressively here
in the past year, trying to make a splash while the management of
United was caught up in a battle for control of the carrier's
parent, UAL Corp.
   UAL's board recently agreed to sell the company to its employees
for about $4.4 billion. Financing for the sale hasn't been arranged
yet, though.
   United already is the leading trans-Pacific carrier among U.S.
airlines, which Clark cited as a good reason for the government to
award the Chicago-Tokyo route to American.
   ``In a situation like this,'' Clark said, ``the DOT should be
looking for the maximum increase in competition ... which does not,
in our view, support giving additional route authority in Japan to
the carrier that is already the biggest carrier between the United
States and the Far East.''
   As for United's political connections, ``we obviously hope it's
not that terribly important,'' Clark said.
   Northwest Airlines and Japan Air Lines already fly between
Chicago and Tokyo, the airline officials said. The proposed route
would add another carrier and a Washington connection.
   Supporting United are Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, Indiana
Gov. Evan Bayh, Kentucky Gov. Wallace G. Wilkinson, Nebraska Gov.
Kay A. Orr and Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder.
   Other politicians backing United's bid include Chicago Mayor
Richard M. Daley, the 24-member Illinois congressional delegation,
Indianapolis Mayor William H. Hudnut III, the Nebraska Legislature
and the 12-member Virginia congressional delegation.

   Martin Shugrue jokes that he packed a magical Irish
shillelagh to help him conjure profits from Eastern Airlines.
   He also brought a wealth of experience and a large dose of
optimism as he began working toward the goal of bringing Eastern
out of bankruptcy protection.
   He may need both wits and wizardry to turn around Eastern's
chronic losses and embittered labor relations in the wake of a
strike by unions that nearly grounded the carrier last year.
   ``I believe Eastern can achieve a financial turnaround,''
Shugrue, who was appointed last week by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton R. Lifland to take control of the Miami-based carrier, said
Monday. ``The bedrock upon which a viable and profitable company
can be built is already in place here.''
   Shugrue would not dismiss the possibility that Eastern might be
sold eventually.
   ``The immediate objective is to restore this airline to
viability. From there, you obviously investigate other
alternatives,'' he said, adding that several parties have already
made initial inquiries about the carrier.
   But he added, ``I did not come here to liquidate this airline.''
   The man who replaced Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo at
Eastern's helm previously served as president of Eastern's sister
Continental Airlines, a post he resigned under pressure in February
1989.
   Shugrue _ described as holding ``the hottest seat in corporate
America'' by one Eastern official _ declined to give a timetable
for a reorganization plan or a labor agreement with pilots or
striking Machinists.
   He urged quick government approval of the proposed sale of
Eastern's Latin American routes to American Airlines. But he said
he would review all other agreements, including those involving
computer reservation systems and a $285 million asset transfer
settlement recently agreed to by Texas Air.
   Eastern's chief labor negotiator Thomas Matthews resigned on
Saturday and will be replaced by Alan C. Gibson, a 25-year Eastern
employee, Shugrue announced. The resignation of Eastern President
Phil Bakes was announced on Friday.
   ``I don't expect any other imminent changes,'' said Shugrue.
   Talks have begun with Machinists union leaders, who have
expressed a desire for a quick back-to-work settlement. But Shugrue
admitted that integrating strikers into the 18,000-employee work
force may be impossible at current operation levels.
   Eastern has signed a back-to-work pact with flight attendants
and is negotiating with the Air Line Pilots Association. Both
unions ended their sympathy walkouts in November.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection five days after the
strike began March 4, 1989.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said a new promotion aimed at
business travelers should begin at the end of the month. Eastern,
which expects to lose $330 million this year, has been operating
between 65 percent and 70 percent capacity on its flights.
   Shugrue said he forsees Eastern remaining close to its present
size and retaining its Atlanta hub. Any relocation of company
headquarters from Miami to Atlanta is ``a low-priority concern at
this time,'' he said.

<HEAD>GM Truck Plant in Pontiac Closing in 1993</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union says General Motors
Corp.'s plans to close a Michigan truck plant and move its products
to a New Jersey plant now making cars is a ``game of musical
chairs.''
   GM said Monday it would close its Pontiac West truck plant in
1993, threatening the jobs of the plant's 2,300 workers.
   UAW officials said they would work to find a vehicle for the
plant north of Detroit to keep its employees on the job.
   ``It's hard to see how greater efficiency and high worker morale
can result from GM's continuing game of musical chairs with the
lives of our members and their families,'' said Stephen P. Yokich,
vice president in charge of the UAW's GM Department.
   The giant automaker said it was moving production of its
S-trucks, called Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy sport-utility
vehicles, to its Linden, N.J., plant. GM's most popular car, the
Chevrolet two-door Corsica and four-door Beretta _ now are made
there.
   Corsica and Beretta production will be consolidated at
Wilmington, Del., where they also are assembled now. Some tooling
will be added later to GM's car plant in Lansing to enable it to
make one of the two cars, GM spokeswoman Kari Hulsey said.
   Corsica and Beretta sales are third behind the Honda Accord and
Ford Taurus through March 31 of this year.
   The Linden plant will be shut down for about six months to
retool for a redesigned S-truck. Hulsey said she didn't know if the
Blazer and Jimmy names would be retained.
   Hulsey said the Linden plant has about 2.5 million square feet
of assembly space and the Pontiac factory had about 1.8 million.
   Auto industry observers have speculated that although
sport-utility sales are running flat this year, the market segment
will grow as the number of four-door versions of the vehicles
increases.
   Pontiac West will continue operating as usual while the Linden
plant, along with GM's Moraine, Ohio, and Shreveport, La., plants,
are prepared for production of the redesigned truck, she said.
Moraine and Shreveport now make S-trucks.
   The cost of renovating the plants for the new truck was not
available, Hulsey said. Employment at the Linden plant was recently
cut in half by the elimination of one of two shifts, leaving it
with about 1,800 hourly and 300 salaried employees, Hulsey said.
   When truck production reaches full steam in Linden, Hulsey said,
GM plans to return to two shifts with a total of about 2,500 hourly
workers.
   Guy Messina, shop chairman of UAW Local 595 in Linden, praised
the announcement of increased employment. ``We have produced
employment and security for our members and that's what it's all
about,'' he said.
   When the shift is complete, it will leave the city of Pontiac
with one plant making full-size pickups. As recently as 1987, GM
operated four assembly plants making three kinds of trucks and a
car in Pontiac, about 25 miles north of Detroit.
   Pontiac Mayor Wallace Holland was in meetings and was
unavailable for comment, said a woman who answered his office phone.
   The current contract between GM and the UAW allows the
shuttering of a plant only when sales of its products slump. But
the Pontiac West plant will close after the current agreement
expires Sept. 14, so it doesn't fall under the restriction.
   Since 1987, when the current GM-UAW contract became effective,
the automaker has closed or announced plans to close five plants in
as many states, putting more than 14,000 people out of work.
   Chrysler Corp. closed a plant in Detroit in February and plans
to close one in Missouri later this year, affecting about 5,600
workers.
   Ford Motor Co. has closed no plants during the current UAW
contract.

<HEAD>Reebok Investor, 13, to Get Special Treatment at Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reebok stockholder Graham Dixon had to get
permission from his mother and an excused absence from school
before he could travel to Los Angeles for the company's annual
meeting today.
   At 13, Graham may be Reebok International Ltd.'s youngest
stockholder, having invested $500 in February for 30 shares of the
athletic-shoe company's stock.
   The seventh-grader will attend company board meetings and sit
with executives on the stage during his first stockholders meeting.
   Graham earned the money to buy the stock by making and peddling
souvenir-style buttons with his 18-year-old brother, Jonathan. He
also took other odd jobs.
   ``I had the money in a savings account, but I wanted to do
something with it _ invest in something,'' Graham said.
   After meeting with a stockbroker and reviewing various stocks,
Graham chose Reebok ``because it's a good, solid company ... and
anyway, I do like their shoes.''
   Graham said he already has received one dividend check _ for
$2.25.
   ``We framed that one,'' said his mother, Jane Dixon. ``But when
the checks start getting bigger, we'll cash them.''
   Mrs. Dixon was hesitant about letting her son make the trip to
Los Angeles.
   ``I asked my mom if I could go,'' Graham said, ``but she told
me, `No way _ that meeting's in California. And besides, you'll be
on the back row.'''
   When Graham persisted, his mother decided to call Reebok's chief
executive officer, Paul Fireman.
   ``The company did some checking,'' Mrs. Dixon said, ``and found
out that Graham was the youngest stockholder. So, Mr. Fireman was
really interested in seeing him come to the meeting as the
company's special guest.''
   Pat Christopher, an assistant in Reebok's corporate
communications office, said Monday she could not confirm whether
Graham is indeed the company's youngest stockholder.
   Graham was scheduled to travel to Los Angeles alone. An
investor, after all, can't be taken seriously if he has his mother
in tow.
   ``He's shy anyway because pimples and braces are his biggest
worry,'' Mrs. Dixon said of her son. ``He certainly didn't need me
tagging along.''

<HEAD>Report: Pennzoil Judge Paid $25,000 By Law Firm Before Texaco
Appointment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texaco attorney says he would have challenged
the qualifications of a judge that approved an $11 billion judgment
against Texaco if he'd known the judge had worked for the opponent
a few months earlier.
   Texas Lawyer, a legal trade publication, reported Monday that
retired state district judge Solomon Casseb Jr. was paid $25,000 by
one of Pennzoil Co.'s law firms for work on a case unrelated to the
1985 fight between Pennzoil and Texaco Inc.
   The payment, which Casseb received while working in a private
practice, was not disclosed to either side during the trial.
   Casseb awarded Pennzoil $11.1 billion. During an appeal, Texaco
and Pennzoil later settled the case out of court for $3 billion.
   Legal experts quoted by Texas Lawyer said the payment to Casseb
should have been disclosed, although it did not violate ethical
canons.
   ``Surely there must be a judge who could be appointed to
complete this case who had not just finished a very substantial
relationship with one of the lead counsel on the other side,''
Texaco attorney Richard Miller said Monday by telephone from his
Houston office.
   William Barnett, managing partner for Pennzoil's law firm, Baker
&amp; Botts, told The Associated Press none of the attorneys working on
the case were aware of the payment. Barnett said the payment on
Feb. 14, 1985 was made on behalf of a client in another case.
   ``There's no way anyone could have forecast'' Casseb would be
appointed to the Texaco-Pennzoil case, Barnett said from Houston.
   Casseb, a retired judge and attorney in San Antonio, did not
grant an interview to Texas Lawyer and did not return telephone
calls from The Associated Press.
   Pennzoil sued Texaco in 1984, claiming it illegally interfered
in a planned merger between Pennzoil and Getty Oil Co. when Texaco
itself acquired Getty.
   Eight weeks into the trial, Judge Anthony J.P. Harris stepped
down citing poor health. On Oct. 22, 1985, administrative Judge
Thomas Stovall appointed Casseb to take over the case.
   Casseb had served as a judge until 1968, when he returned to
private practice. Texas Lawyer said he qualified as a retired
judge, agreeing to sit as a visiting judge anywhere in Texas, in
May 1985.
   In November 1985, a jury awarded Pennzoil $10.53 billion, and
Casseb approved the verdict. With interest, the total judgment was
$11.1 billion.
   An appeals court later reduced the punitive damages and in 1987,
when Texaco lost attempts to avoid posting $10 billion bond, the
company filed for federal bankruptcy court protection.
   In December 1987, Texaco and Pennzoil agreed to settle the case
for $3 billion.

   BAT Industries PLC says it will press ahead with
its massive asset sales program even though Sir James Goldsmith has
dropped his hostile $22 billion takeover bid for the British
conglomerate.
   BAT drew up the restructuring plan hoping to boost its stock
price and fight off the Anglo-French financier's all-paper bid of
878 pence a share, or the equivalent of $14.31.
   The plan calls for BAT to sell its retailing and paper
businesses _ including Saks Fifth Avenue and the just-sold Marshall
Field's _ in order to concentrate on tobacco and financial
services. It also includes the repurchase by the company of up to
10 percent of its stock.
   Goldsmith's withdrawal, announced after the stock market closed
Monday and blamed on regulatory frustrations involving BAT's U.S.
insurance subsidiary, was expected to depress BAT's share price.
   The shares fell 24 pence, or around 39 cents, to 700 pence, or
$11.41 on London's Stock Exchange at midday today. The news of the
withdrawal came after Monday's close.
   ``It's obviously going to be a little bit unsettled in the
short-term,'' said Jack Jones, an analyst with the brokerage UBS
Philips and Drew.
   But Kishore Bangor, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
in London, said investors would turn their attention to BAT's
fundamentals and the stock would look relatively cheap.
   The offer by Goldsmith's Hoylake Investments Ltd. would have
been the world's second-largest takeover after Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co.'s $25 billion purchase of RJR Nabisco Inc., completed
early last year.
   Hoylake launched the offer in July, then suspended it in
September while it sought regulatory approval.
   Two weeks ago, California's insurance regulators decided to bar
a change of control of BAT's Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los
Angeles. The offer needed approval from the commissioners of a
total of nine states where Farmers operates.
   Hoylake abandoned its bid because of delays caused by the U.S.
regulatory process, said a London source close to the company.
   ``We have always felt we could achieve a favorable position but
it could take quite a while,'' said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``We didn't feel it was in the best
interests of the shareholders given the uncertainties.''
   Hoylake had planned to sell Farmers for $4.5 billion to the
French insurance group Axa-Midi Assurances. Axa-Midi announced in
Paris Monday that it has dropped its bid.
   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy welcomed Hoylake's withdrawal in a
statement. ``Shareholders gave overwhelming support to our
reshaping proposals last October,'' he said, referring to a
shareholder vote backing the restructuring plan.
   ``Today's overdue decision by Hoylake does not alter our resolve
to see that program through to its completion and to continue to
maximize value for our shareholders.''
   Last week, BAT announced the sale of its U.S. retailer Marshall
Field's to Dayton Hudson Corp. for $1.04 billion. The company also
has put Saks Fifth Avenue on the auction block.
   Goldsmith and other shareholders have complained that BAT's
stock price does not reflect its value because it is dragged down
by the slower growth of the tobacco businesses, which include Brown
&amp; Williamson in the United States.
   Goldsmith and his Hoylake partners, who included British
merchant banker Jacob Rothschild and Australian businessman Kerry
Packer, had wanted to ``unbundle'' BAT by selling off all its
non-tobacco operations.
   In its statement Monday Hoylake said, ``The directors of Hoylake
wish BAT and its unbundled offspring great success within their new
structures.''

   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker, said

   Toyota spokesman Yoshiharu Tateishi said the plant will be
capable of producing 20,000 cars annually.
   He said about 3,000 Corollas would be produced in the initial
year, with production increasing later to 10,000 a year. Toyota may
also add commercial vehicles later, Tateishi said.
   Toyota will join with local interests and invest around $66.5
million for the plant, which will be built in Port Qasim, about 25
miles east of Karachi.

   General Motors Corp. must continue to defend a
nationwide suit by some owners seeking damages for defects in
diesel engines after their warranties expired, the U.S. Supreme
Court decided.
   The court refused Monday to review a 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruling that consumers can be protected beyond time limits
set by the manufacturer by an ``implied warranty'' that a product
is fit for its ordinary purpose.
   GM lawyers charged that the lower court's August 1989 ruling
``will have intolerable consequences for manufacturers of consumer
products throughout the United States.''
   GM and the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association said the
ruling could trigger a wave of lawsuits by ``anyone who suffered
repair costs at any time,'' and could extend to all consumer
transactions.
   Lawyers for consumers said GM's arguments were exaggerated.
   The Supreme Court let stand the appeals court's ruling that GM
must defend against a suit by 600,000 owners of 1981-85 cars and
trucks with 5.7-liter diesel engines who made claims for defects
after their warranties expired.
   GM's warranties covered the engines for two years or 24,000
miles for 1981-82 models and three years or 50,000 miles for
1983-85 models.
   Lawyers for the vehicle owners charge GM knew but didn't
disclose that its diesel engines would fail prematurely.

<TEXT>
   Wages, salaries and other benefits paid to
American workers shot up 5.5 percent over the past year, the
largest jump in six years, the government reported today.
   The Labor Department attributed much of the increase in its
Employment Cost Index, one of the best measures of wage inflation,
to the continued soaring cost of health insurance and other
benefits.
   Health insurance alone increased 12.1 percent for the year
ending in March, following the 13.4 percent rise registered for the
12-month period ending in March 1989.
   The 5.5 percent rise in overall employment costs was the largest
12-month surge since March 1984, when wages, benefits and salaries
increased by 5.9 percent, the government said. A year ago,
employment costs had gone up 4.8 percent for the same period.
   Economists have been concerned that tight labor markets are
pushing labor costs higher and worsening the nation's inflation
problems. Last month, the nation's already relatively low
unemployment rate fell a notch to 5.2 percent.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., called the
report a ``big negative on the inflation outlook.''
   ``It shows that we have a rock hard, high employment cost lump
facing American business that is being passed on at the retail
level,'' Sinai said.
   Today's report showed that wages and salaries rose 4.2 percent
over the year ending in March, the same as the increase from a year
earlier, while benefit costs jumped 7.2 percent, compared with a
5.4 percent rise a year before.
   The jump in benefit costs was blamed on higher health insurance
and an increase in social security taxes, up from 7.51 percent to
7.65 percent.
   Workers in the service sector of the economy fared slightly
better than the manufacturing sector in pay gains. Service
industries saw wages and salaries go up by 4.2 percent in the past
12 months compared to a 4.0 percent rise for the manufacturing
sector.
   The gain reflects the fact that service industries have been
more affected by shortages of workers in the past year.
   However, there was a wide split in pay gains in the services
category. At the low end, wages in food stores and banking rose
just 2.8 percent while wages at hospitals and health care clinics
shot up 6.3 percent.
   Non-union workers continued on a six-year pattern of gaining
better wage and salary advances than their union counterparts. Over
the past 12 months, wages and salaries rose 4.4 percent for
non-union workers while increasing 3.4 percent for union workers.
   With benefits included, compensation costs rose 5.4 percent for
non-union workers while increasing 4.3 percent for those in unions.
   State and local government workers gained 5.6 percent increases
in wages and salaries over the past year, compared with the 4.7
percent increases gained a year ago. Health services workers
received the highest increases, 6.7 percent.
   Private industry workers in the Northeast fared the best in
terms of wage and salary gains. Workers in that region saw their
wages and salaries increase by 5.4 percent, compared with a 3.5
percent rise for workers in the Midwest and a 3.4 percent gain for
those in the West. Southern workers enjoyed gains of 4.3 percent.

   The stock market advanced in the early going
today, reversing a four-session losing streak with the boost from a
strengthening bond market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.73 at 2,671.40
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange issues, with 655 up, 334 down and 490
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.12 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   ``It's a fairly positive opening,'' said Hildegarde Zagorski, a
vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., noting that the
Dow has lost nearly 100 points in the past four sessions.
   Stocks were supported by strength in the bond market, where
prices were lifted following the government's release of a
stronger-than-expected 6.7 percent rise in durable goods orders or
March.
   Zagorski said stock prices responded with a ``technical bounce.
The market's been down a long way and it's entitled to some kind of
bounce, but we don't know how long it's going to last.''
   Among actively traded blue-chip issues, Philip Morris was
unchanged at 41|, AT&amp;T was up &lsqb; at 40{, IBM was up &lsqb; at 109{ and
Digital Equipment was up { at 83}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.54 to 182.47. At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value
index was up 0.94 at 345.89.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 29.28 to
2,666.67, extending its loss since last Tuesday to 99.10 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 330 up, 1,223 down and 420 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 136.15 million shares, down from 174.26

<HEAD>Labor Agreements Average 3.3 Percent So Far This Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracts settled through collective
bargaining in the first three months of 1990 gave workers average
annual wage increases of 3.3 percent over the life of the pacts,
the government reported today.
   The last time parties covered by those settlements negotiated,
usually in 1987 or 1988, average wage gains were smaller, averaging
2.2 percent over the contract term, the Labor Department said.
   Part of the gains reflect wage increases where there had been
cuts or freezes in previous agreements, such as in the steel
industry, the department said.
   In addition, wage gains were larger than pay raises negotiated
in previous agreements, particularly in petroleum refining and food
stores, the government said.
   For the 12-month period ending in March, settlements that were
reached provided wage adjustments averaging 3.4 percent a year over
the contract life, compared with 2.3 percent when the same parties
previously bargained.
   The average annual wage gains over the contract life has been
increasing since the low of 1.7 percent for a 12-month period,
which occurred for the year ending in September 1986.
   The collective bargaining report, like the Labor Department's
broader Employment Cost Index that also was released today, showed
workers in the fast-growing service sector winning larger wage
gains than manufacturing workers. Service workers received an
average annual gain of 3.4 percent over the contract life while
manufacturing workers received an average boost of 3.2 percent.
   The average construction worker received gains of 3.8 percent a
year over the life of the contract, the report said.
   The Labor Department said the 74 collective bargaining
agreements it analyzed covered about 318,000 workers. The
government tracks agreements covering bargaining units with at
least 1,000 workers.
   The government said 186 such agreements covering about 590,000
workers are scheduled to expire or reopen for wage negotiations
during the April-June 1990 period, with many of those jobs in the
construction industry.
   In addition, there are about 695,000 workers under 111 contracts
that had expired or been reopened, but not renegotiated or
ratified, prior to the end of March. More than half those workers
are railroad employees.

<HEAD>Dow Chemical Quarterly Earnings Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Chemical Co. reported Tuesday that its
first-quarter profit fell 38 percent over a year ago as rising
material costs and sagging prices of some products offset an
increase in sales.
   For the three months ended March 31, Dow netted $462 million, or
$1.71 per share, compared with earnings of $743 million, or $2.72 a
share, in 1989.
   Quarterly sales rose 9 percent to $4.90 billion from $4.49
billion.
   Chief Executive Officer Frank Popoff attributed the lower profit
partly to a drop prices in some ethylene-based products and to
higher feedstock costs.
   But he remained optimistic about the rest of the year.
   ``As we enter the second quarter, feedstock costs are declining
and prices for several large-volume products are increasing,''
Popoff said in a statement. ``Our value-added businesses continue
to show sales and earnings growth and provide a solid profit base
for the company.''
   Dow, a global manufacturer of basic chemicals, plastics,
pharmaceuticals and household products, reported net income of
$2.49 billion for 1989 on sales of $17.60 billion.

<TEXT>
   Monsanto Co. reported Tuesday that its
first-quarter profit fell 13 percent from last year because of soft
conditions in the automotive industry and a seasonal slowdown in
agriculture.
   For the quarter ended March 31, the chemical and agricultural
products giant had a profit of $194 million, or $2.95 a share, down
from a record $222 million, or $3.24 a share, earnings in 1989.
   Sales for the quarter were flat, $2.28 billion compared with
last year's $2.26 billion.
   Chairman Richard Mahoney said, ``Despite the fact that earnings
were below those of last year's record first quarter, we're
confident about the prospects for the rest of the year. We expect
to make 1990 another record year for Monsanto.''
   Monsanto produces a wide variety of chemicals including
compounds that are used in automobile dashboards, windshields and
tires. The company also manufactures pesticides and animal feed
supplements.
   Mahoney said earnings from agricultural chemicals fell in the
first quarter because farmers were either waiting to buy some
chemicals in bulk or were choosing lower-priced formulations.
   Monsanto's chemical segment had slightly lower operating
profits, but considering that the automotive industry was soft,
Mahoney said the segment performed well.
   ``We think the worst is behind us in these auto markets,'' he
said.
   Monsanto's drug subsidiary, G.D. Searle, showed a $4 million
profit compared with an $8 million loss in the first quarter of
1989, and The Nutrasweet Co., which is also owned by Monsanto, had
slightly lower profits because of the cost of introducing its new
frozen dairy dessert, Simple Pleasures.

   The stock market was higher in moderate trading
today, reflecting gains in bond prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.73 at 2,671.40
at 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading

   Stocks were supported by strength in the bond market, where
prices rose following the government's release of a

   But bonds began to ease after investors digested the report, and
stock prices retreated in tandem from their early highs.
   ``The bond market is continuing to pressure the stock market as
it has for the past several days,'' said C. Beth Cotner, a vice
president at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
   ``Rising interest rates lower stock valuations'' and make

   Control Data Corp. said Tuesday that
its first-quarter profit nearly doubled from a year ago because of
a huge after-tax gain from its restructuring, but revenue of the
scaled-down computer company declined sharply.
   Net income for the first three months of 1990 totaled $6.8
million, or 16 cents a share, compared with earnings of $3.5
million, or 8 cents, in 1989.
   Revenue were more than halved, to $421.6 million from $843.5
million.
   The latest results included a $5.8 million gain from the
company's restructuring.
   Control Data sold or discontinued several operating units,
including its Imprimis disk drive subsidiary and its maintenance
business. It also laid off 7,750 workers last year, and replaced
its chief executive officer, Robert M. Price.
   Lawrence Perlman, who took the helm of Control Data in January,
said, ``Apart from restructuring gains and charges, Control Data
has now been profitable for three consecutive quarters.
   ``Although the first quarter traditionally has not been a strong
one for Control Data, earnings were stronger in several businesses
than we had anticipated. Business Management Services sustained its
revenue and earnings growth, and Computer Products continued to
make progress.''
   The company posted a net loss of $680.4 million in 1989, the
worst in its 32-year history.

White House-congressional budget reduction summit would work. Picks

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee
said today that Congress must craft its own 1991 budget because the
Bush administration isn't giving it serious attention.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., told the committee that he hoped to
draft a $1.2 trillion budget by having members consider at least
three alternatives with deficit reduction ranging from $50 billion
down to $37 billion.
   Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the
panel, promised to cooperate, but said he didn't think Sasser's
strategy would work.
   ``The missing link is the president of the United States,'' he
said.
   But Sasser said ``at this point, at least, the administration
isn't serious'' about the budget.
   ``I have very severe doubts that negotiations with the White
House are the way to go,'' he said.
   Before today's meeting, Sasser had worked for weeks without
success to find a consensus among the 10 Republicans and 13
Democrats on the committee for a deficit-reduction plan.
   Domenici contended today that having Congress adopt a budget on
its own, almost certainly supported only by the majority Democrats,
``dooms the resolution to either a partisan piece of paper or an
inoperative document.''
   Two of the panel's Democrats _ Sens. Ernest Hollings of South
Carolina and Charles Robb of Virginia _ also appear unhappy, saying
deeper cuts are needed. Their defections would leave Sasser one
vote shy of being able to send a measure to the full Senate.
   Despite this, Sasser expressed confidence that the committee
would eventually approve a budget, perhaps by week's end.
   ``I can't believe that members of the majority will want to sit
around and let Gramm-Rudman necessitate cuts, which is what would
occur unless we go about our business here,'' he said.
   The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law sets a target of a $64
billion shortfall for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. Under
current projections, that would mean that at least $37 billion in
savings must be found. If they are not, the law automatically
triggers spending cuts in many government programs.
   White House budget director Richard Darman said last week that
because of the economy's poor recent performance, the amount of
deficit-reduction needed to satisfy Gramm-Rudman now ranges from
$45 billion to $57 billion or more.
   All of Sasser's proposals would shift some of the money Bush
wants to spend on defense to domestic programs.
   Sasser favors limiting next year's defense spending to $292
billion _ $15 billion below the amount needed to stay even with
inflation and $4 billion below spending this year. Bush has
proposed $304 billion for the military.
   The plans Sasser put forward provide defense expenditures
ranging from $287 billion to $292 billion. They each rely on $13.9
billion in new tax receipts, the same amount Bush has requested.
They vary in the amount of savings that would come from domestic
program cuts and new fees from $8.3 billion to $16.1 billion.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, proposed last week that defense spending be limited to
about $297 billion.
   Last Thursday, the House Budget Committee approved a budget that
would hold military spending to $295 billion. That
Democratic-written spending plan, approved on a strict party-line
vote, could go to the House floor by Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Bond prices were recovering in early trading
today as some investors moved to buy securities at cheap levels.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was up \ point, or
$2.50 for every $1,000 in face value, at around midday. Its yield,
which falls when the price rises, declined to 8.93 percent from
8.96 percent late Monday.
   By Monday, the 30-year bond had plunged more than $41 per $1,000
over the previous seven trading days in response to signs of
increasing inflation, a stronger economy and worries about upcoming
bond issues, including the Treasury's quarterly refunding auction
set for next month.
   Higher inflation and an economic upturn could prompt the Federal
Reserve to keep interest rates high. Higher rates erode the value
of fixed-return investments such as bonds.
   Today, ``the market was ready to do a little better,'' said John
Sebastian, an executive vice president of Clayton Brown &amp;
Associates in Chicago. ``People are doing some bottom-fishing in
here.''
   Sebastian noted that bond prices recovered despite a government
report this morning that orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
jumped 6.7 percent in March, the sharpest increase in more than a
year. The data gave support to the idea of a strong economy, one of
the bond market's current fears.
   The market also is looking toward Friday's report on the U.S.

   The dollar retreated against most major currencies
in European trading Tuesday.
   Gold prices rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the West German mark's move
through 93.20 Japanese yen _ a key technical chart point _ kicked
off a flurry of activity in afternoon European dealings.
   By late in the European day, the mark was quoted at about 93.67
yen, up from 92.92 yen late Monday. It had moved briefly above 94
yen before retreating in late dealings.
   Otherwise, dealers said, there was little buying or selling
interest in the currency markets.
   ``Everybody is range trading and looking at technicals,'' said
Laudy Bahl, head of corporate dealings at Bank of Tokyo in London.
   Late in London, the dollar was quoted at 1.6930 marks, down from
1.6960 marks late Monday in London. Also in London, the British
pound was quoted at $1.6345, compared with $1.6365 late Monday.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.60 yen to a closing 158.15
yen. It was quoted at a higher rate of 158.59 yen later in London.
   Other dollar rates compared with late Monday's levels were:
1.4865 Swiss francs, down from 1.4925; 5.6795 French francs, down
from 5.6930; 1.9100 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9090; 1,241.00
Italian lire, down from 1,244.00; and 1.1590 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1610.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.6935 West
German marks; 158.625 Japanese yen; 1.48585 Swiss francs; and

<HEAD>Richmond Council Scuttles 20-Cent-Per-Pack Cigarette Tax Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council has unanimously rejected a
proposed 20-cents-a-pack cigarette tax in this city where tobacco
giant Philip Morris Companies Inc. is the largest private employer.
   ``I felt it was not appropriate for the city of Richmond to do
this because tobacco has been a major industry since the city's
beginning,'' said Mayor Geline B. Williams, who introduced the
proposal that effectively killed the tax.
   The tax, which was defeated Monday night, would have raised $3.2
million. It was one of several proposals in City Manager Robert C.
Bobb's proposed 1990-91 budget aimed at shifting the tax burden
from property owners to consumers.
   Twenty-nine localities in the state impose a cigarette tax, but
Richmond was viewed by cigarette manufacturers as a place where
they needed to prevail.
   New York-based Philip Morris employs 11,000 people at a
cigarette manufacturing plant here.
   Tobacco industry representatives argued that the tax would
generate far less revenue than predicted because consumers would
leave the city to buy cigarettes elsewhere.
   Bill Daunhauer of the Bakery, Confectionary and Tobacco Workers
International Union, AFL-CIO, said tobacco company employees give
more than $1 million a year to the local United Way campaign,
exclusive of corporate gifts.
   ``It would seem an injustice to these workers for the city to
pass any legislation that may cost them their livelihood,'' he said.
   Anne Morrow Donley, executive director of the Virginia Group to
Alleviate Smoking in Public, said the non-smoking majority of
Richmonders have to subsidize the industry through increased
insurance rates and tax rates.
   ``Until the tobacco industry is willing or required to make
reparations for the harm their products cause, it makes sense to
require those who use the product to bear the cost of it to
society,'' she said.
   The council directed Bobb to find a way other than the cigarette
tax to raise the money.

<HEAD>Excerpts From Michael Milken's Admission of Guilt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from a statement made by
ex-Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier Michael Milken in
Manhattan federal court Tuesday, when he pleaded guilty to six
felonies in the biggest securities fraud settlement against an
individual in history:
   ``I was the founder and head of the High Yield and Convertible
Securities Department at Drexel. In pioneering the creation of new
instruments for the financing of companies, most of which did not
have access to the capital markets because they did not have
investment-grade ratings, and in making markets in such securities,
we operated under unique, highly demanding, and intensely
competitive conditions. But I do not cite these conditions as an
excuse for not conforming to all of the laws that governed our
highly regulated business. I am here today because in connection
with some transactions, I transgressed certain of the laws and
regulations that govern our industry. I was wrong in doing so and
knew that at the time and I am pleading guilty to these offenses.
   ``One of the accounts we did business with was the (Ivan) Boesky
Organization, which also did business with many other firms. Drexel
did some financings for and trading with the Boesky firm, but
Drexel's business with the Boesky Organization never approached one
percent of the business of our department. He traded in stocks; I
traded primarily in bonds, or their equivalent. But because he was
a major factor in the securities markets, he had the potential to
become a more significant account. We were not social friends, and
had little in common. The relationship started as an arms length
and correct one. Unfortunately, however, certain of our
transactions involved reciprocal accommodations, some of which
violated the law...
   ``Because of the tremendous amount of publicity that has
surrounded this case, I wish to make clear that my plea is an
acceptance of personal responsibility for my own failings and
actions, and not a reflection on the underlying soundness and
integrity of the segment of the capital markets in which we
specialized and which provided capital that enabled hundreds of
companies to survive, expand and flourish. Our business was in no
way dependent on these practices. Nor did they comprise a
fundamental part of our business and I regret them very much.
   ``This investigation and proceeding are now in their fourth
year. This long period has been extremely painful and difficult for
my family and friends as well as myself. I realize that by my acts
I have hurt those who are closest to me. I am truly sorry. I thank
the Court for permitting me to add this apology and for its
fairness in handling this complex case.''

   The stock market struggled to hang on to modest
gains today in directionless trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.25 at 2,668.92
at 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange issues, with 743 up, 626 down and 543
unchanged.
   The market pushed into positive territory on the opening as
investors were encouraged by higher bond prices, which translate to
lower interest rates. The bond market gained despite a government
report showing a stronger-than-expected 6.7 percent rise in durable
goods orders in March.
   The market continued to look to bond prices for its cue. But
Eugene Peroni, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in
Philadelphia, noted that stock prices were ``rudderless because
there is still a lot of uncertainty over the direction of interest
rates.
   Rising interest rates lower stock valuations and make corporate
borrowing more expensive.
   Most of those who bought equities were lured by their attractive
prices following a week-long market slide that saw the Dow lose
nearly 100 points.
   ``We're in a kind of market with a lot of sideline cash,'' said
Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst at MKI Securities Corp. ``A
lot of people sold out of the market ... and some are (now) willing
to put money back in.''
   Among other actively traded blue-chip issues, Ames Department

   Sales of North American-made cars and light
trucks by the nation's Big Three automakers plummeted 20.5 percent
in mid-April compared with last year, when incentives were far more
generous, the companies said Tuesday.
   The companies said they sold an average of 30,742 cars and light
trucks a day during the April 11-20 period this year compared with
a rate of 38,686 a day during the same time last year.
   Car sales dropped 23 percent and truck sales were off 16.6
percent.
   At the end of March and the beginning of April last year,
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. introduced
new incentive plans that boosted cash rebates and slashed loan
interest rates.
   Because of the packages, people flocked to showrooms, boosting
the April sales rate to one of the highest in 1989.
   But this year, the incentives didn't work as well.
   Since Jan. 1, car and truck sales by the Big Three were 6.4
percent behind last year's pace. The automakers sold a daily
average of 31,452 for the entire year this year compared with a
33,612-vehicle-a-day rate during the same period last year.
   A 9.2-percent decline in car sales was softened by a 1.9 percent
drop in truck sales.
   Chrysler has suffered the most as the sales rate slows this
year. During mid-April, its combined car and truck sales were 36.2
percent behind last year's rate. The company's car sales were down
38.4 percent and truck sales were off 33.9 percent.
   So far this year, Chrysler's cars and trucks were selling at a
pace 10.8 percent slower than last year.
   Ford said its mid-April car and truck sales were down 19 percent
this year compared with last year as car sales dipped 22.7 percent
and truck sales fell 13.1 percent.
   For the entire year, Ford's combined vehicle sales were down 8.7
percent.
   GM said its car sales in mid-April fell 18.9 percent and truck
sales tumbled 9.6 percent, combining for a 15.9 percent decline in
vehicle sales.
   So far this year, GM's car and truck sales were down 3.1
percent, despite a 2.3 percent rise in truck sales. GM's
year-to-date car sales were down 5.7 percent.

   Junk-bond pioneer Michael Milken's cathartic
guilty plea to securities fraud today provoked reactions ranging
from sympathy by defense lawyers to scornful snubs on Wall Street,
where many say his prolonged bout with the law helped taint the
integrity of the financial markets.
   ``The Milken case was like a cleansing process that should
restore investor confidence,'' said John Eric Smith, a floor
official at the New York Stock Exchange, when word broke of
Milken's tearful admission to six felony counts in a packed
Manhattan federal court.
   The 43-year-old former head bond trader for now-bankrupt Drexel
Burnham Lambert, which revolutionized the securities industry with
the use of high-yield ``junk bonds'' that financed the takeover
boom of the 1980s, had insisted he was innocent for more than three
years before changing his mind.
   Most of the counts to which he pleaded guilty were related to
Drexel's relationship with speculator Ivan Boesky, the convicted
felon who provided much of the information for prosecutions of Wall
Street corruption in recent years.
   It was Boesky's revelations about insider trading and other
crimes that helped humble Drexel and eventually drive it into
bankruptcy court earlier this year, putting 10,000 people out of
work.
   Milken faces a maximum 28 year prison term and must forfeit $600
million in fines and restitution to defrauded investors, but it
will still leave him one of the nation's wealthiest individuals.
   ``I don't think we'll have to pass the hat for the guy. You know
what I mean?'' said a middle-aged NYSE worker queried in lower
Manhattan's financial district. He declined to identify himself by
name.
   Lawyers familiar with the Milken case speculated the hardest
thing for him to do was stand up in open court and admit he was a
felon after insisting he was innocent for so long.
   ``I think it was a fairly tragic and humbling proceeding for
Milken,'' said Theodore Wells, a lawyer who has represented other
white collar defendants in fallout from the Boesky-Drexel scandal.
``Hopefully, people will remember all of the good that he did for
the financial markets and not focus exclusively on these apparent
aberrations.''
   Some said the charges in the plea agreement, drastically fewer
and less serious than the 98-count racketeering-fraud indictment
Milken faced had he not pleaded guilty, did not mean the government
had let him off easily. Many believe Milken will have to do some
prison time.
   ``Whether it's six counts or 26 counts, it doesn't make a
difference in the end and the message is the same,'' said Paul
Fischer, a securities law attorney in Washington and former
Securities and Exchange lawyer who helped develop the investigation
that eventually led to prosecutions of Boesky, Drexel and Milken.
   ``Six felony counts are six felony counts. The exposure he has
is still 28 years,'' said Ira L. Sorkin, a former SEC administrator
in New York who now is in private practice.
   ``It's silly to play the game of who got the better deal,''
Sorkin said. ``The fact of the matter is Mr. milken is a convicted
felon. Federal prison, minimum or maximum, is not a very pleasant
place.''

<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hitachi Ltd. is believed to be the first
Japanese company operating a research lab at an American university
now that it has opened a biotechnology center at the University of
California here.
   Hitachi officials said Monday they hope the $16.5 million
laboratory, called Plumwood House because of its plum color, will
allow the company to advance in areas like neuroscience and
biochemistry, where it has traditionally been weak.
   ``Hitachi has been devoting (research) in recent years to
biotechnology, but we are not advanced in this area,'' said Hiroshi
Sumiyama, who heads the lab.
   ``That's why the company decided to locate the facility in the
United States, (which) is more advanced in biotechnology research.
UCI gave us the opportunity to do this,'' he said.
   UCI leased 1{ acres to Hitachi for 40 years. In return, UCI
researchers can use 15,000 of the 40,000-square-foot building
called Plumwood House.
   ``The university is getting great laboratory space at no expense
to the taxpayers,'' said John Wasmuth, one of three UCI researchers
assigned to the lab.
   The lab will be used by 60 Hitachi and UCI researchers.
   State officials noted the venture will benefit both the
university and Hitachi, while any discoveries by lab researchers
will go to UCI.
   ``It's not going to succeed if the general public does not
benefit before Hitachi,'' said Allan Melkesian, director of the
state Office of Foreign Investment. ``There is going to be a lot of
scrutiny as there ought to be. It is a sensitive area.''
   Foreign investment on college campuses is not new. A consortium
of German companies built a computer science building at the
University of California, Berkeley campus, and a Japanese
pharmaceutical company is constructing a lab at the UC San Diego
campus.
   Four U.S. corporations, including Texas Instruments, have
established laboratories at Japanese institutions.
   Another Japanese electronics giant, NEC Corp., plans to open an
artificial intelligence laboratory in Princeton, N.J., next month.
NEC is spending $75 million for the project, and company officials
say they intend to recruit researchers from Princeton University.
   Joint ventures between Japanese companies and American
universities are likely to grow, according to Richard King, a Los
Angeles-based international trade consultant.
   ``I think we will find many more of these kinds of ventures
where the Japanese want to tie in with research and development and
high-technology endeavors and the universities welcome that,
because it's a private-public sector relationship where benefits
accrue to both sides,'' King said.

   Italy's Olivetti and Japan's Sanyo and
Mitsui on Tuesday opened a factory to produce facsimile machines,
the first hi-tech joint-venture involving Italian and Japanese
firms in southern Italy.
   Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Olivetti, Italy's largest
computer group, said that the plant could ``integrate Olivetti's
extensive European commerical operation with high-level Japanese
technology.''
   Sanyo is an industrial giant which markets electrical products
worldwide, while Mitsui is one of Japan's largest trading
companies. Both are engaged in joint ventures with other European
firms.
   The new plant, called the Olivetti Sanyo Industriale factory,
was completed in nine months. It will produce 200,000 facsimile
machines a year, the officials said.
   Eluchii Hori, chairman of Mitsui and Co. Europe, said that the
new plant was set up easily because of Olivetti's expertise in
dealing with Italian bureaucracy.
   Officials said the plant in Italy's economically depressed south
will employ about 330 people. Over the next four years Olivetti
intends to invest 770 billion lire, or $616 million, in the region,
officials said.
   This is the second time that De Benedetti has sought to blend
Italian entrepreneurial skills with Japanese technological
know-how. In 1987 Olivetti joined with Canon to produce copiers at
Ivrea in northern Italy.
   Italy and Japan are keen to expand industrial relations. Last
year Japanese and Italian experts met in Tokyo to discuss improving
scientific and technological ties. Italian officals called then for
an increase in co-operation on computers and robots.

   Stock prices fell today for the fifth-straight
session as a late round of computer-triggered selling wiped out
initial gains.
   The market advanced on the opening, boosted by rising bond
prices. Stocks appeared to mirror the seesawing of the credit
market for much of the session and struggled to hold on to gains
once bonds came under pressure.
   Government bonds yielding close to 9 percent proved an
attractive alternative to equities. But some analysts noted that
with a substantial amount of cash on the sidelines, investors were
not forced to sell stocks to buy bonds.
   Trading was moderate.
   Alfred E. Goldman, a vice president at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
in St. Louis, called the market's performance ``a little
disappointing because it tried to go up _ both the generals and the
troops.''
   He was encouraged that although bond prices fell, they were down
only fractionally and the market seemed to be stabilizing.
   Stocks recently have been taking their cue from bond prices,
which fall when interst rates rise. Higher interest rates lower
stock valuations and make corporate borrowing more expensive.

   Junk bond giant Michael Milken tearfully pleaded
guilty today to six criminal charges and agreed to pay $600 million
to settle the biggest Wall Street fraud case ever against an
individual.
   ``I realize by my acts I have hurt those who are closest to me.
I am truly sorry,'' Milken said, breaking down and crying as he
read a statement in court.
   Included were guilty pleas for aiding speculator Ivan Boesky in
several securities law violations; for aiding another trader in
filing false income tax returns; and for conspiring to violate
securities laws.
   Milken did not plead to any charges of insider trading or
racketeering, which were the most serious in the government's
original, broad indictment of him.
   Sentencing was set for Oct. 1. Milken faces a possible maximum
total of up to 28 years in prison.
   Milken, 43, entered his guilty plea at 12:42 p.m. before U.S.
District Judge Kimba Wood in a courtroom packed with about 250
people in lower Manhattan.
   The move capped the stunning decline of the former head of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-yield bond department, who
gained notoriety for engineering financing for some of the biggest
corporate takeovers of the 1980s and then for allegations of
widespread wrongdoing.
   Milken was the main target of the government's lengthy
investigation of Wall Street crime that resulted in more than 30
convictions, and he was the last to fall.
   Milken was linked to a large insider trading network headed by
Boesky, who paid $100 million and was sentenced to three years in
prison in exchange for providing information against Milken, Drexel
and others.
   After three years of rumors and press leaks, the Justice
Department in March 1989 indicted Milken, his brother, Lowell, and
former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg on an unprecedented 98 counts of
fraud and racketeering.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Under the plea deal, all charges were dropped against Lowell
Milken, a lawyer and key aide to his brother at Drexel. The case
against Newberg was not resolved.
   After the hearing, Lowell Milken issued a statement repeating
his claim of innocence and calling it ``one of the saddest and most
frustrating days of my life.''
   ``The pain inflicted on our families cannot be undone. I am
proud of my brother and nothing that has happened here today has
changed that,'' the statement read.
   Michael Milken pleaded guilty to counts of conspiracy; aiding
and abetting failure to meet federal securities disclosure
regulations; securities fraud; aiding and abetting a regulated
broker-dealer to violate securities reporting requirements; mail
fraud; and assisting in filing a false tax return.
   The first five counts carry a maximum five years each in prison
and the tax count has a maximum three year setnence, for a possible
total of 28 years.
   Milken agreed to pay $200 million in penalties to the government
and $400 million to set up a fund for reimbursing investors
defrauded by his actions.
   ``We believe that this prosecution and the fact that Mr. Milken
has admitted to guilt will send the right message to the financial
community,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll told the
court.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, told a news conference in Washington: ``Mr. Milken has
been portrayed as wrongly accused, and as having simply devoted
himself to the financing of small or emerging business. Despite the
efforts to mold public opinion, Mr. Milken's admissions today
demonstrate that he stood at the center of a network of
manipulation, fraud and deceit.''
   Milken, wearing a blue suit, white shirt and blue polka-dot tie,
read a lengthy statement detailing the crimes that he pleaded
guilty to. He summarized his work as head of Drexel's high-yield
bond department, which helped reshape corporate America by
pioneering the wide use of its so-called ``junk bonds'' to raise
money for small companies and finance corporate takeovers.
   The original indictment had charged the defendants with illegal
securities trading, stock manipulation and other fraudulent
activity, some in connection with a series of corporate mergers and
acquisitions.
   Milken had pleaded innocent and repeatedly said he would fight
the charges at trial, but reversed his position after months of
negotiations between the government and his attorneys.
   He had faced a much longer prison term and possible forfeiture
of his wealth, said to be more than $1 billion, under the original
charges.
   The plea deal was reached Friday after the U.S. Attorney's
Office said it would bring a broader indictment as it had been
threatening to do for nearly a year if Milken did not settle.
   Milken told the court he violated the law in doing business with
Boesky in 1984, when Boesky acquired more than 10 percent of the
stock of Fischbach Corp., a takeover target at the time.
   As part of his dealings, Milken told Boesky that Drexel would
cover any losses Boesky suffered in trading the stock, in violation
of federal disclosure requirements.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Milken also admitted to securities fraud in an arrangement with
Boesky involving the sale of MCA Inc. stock by Drexel client Golden
Nugget Inc. in the fall of 1984.
   In the tax-related count, Milken said he helped Drexel client
David Solomon, head of Solomon Asset Management, engage in illegal
trading and create fictitious losses for tax purposes.
   Milken broke down as he finished his statement. His attorney,
Arthur Liman, placed his hand on his back for support as Milken
finished reading.
   Milken is required to answer questions about the government's
continuing insider trading and savings and loan investigations but
he does not have to provide specific information to help develop
other fraud cases.
   He will not be questioned until after sentencing, limiting the
government's control over the impact of his cooperation.
   After his indictment, Milken set aside about $700 million to
guarantee payment in the event of conviction. It was unclear
whether that money would be used to pay the new penalties.
   Milken, the son of an accountant, is widely regarded as the
nation's most important financial figure since J.P. Morgan
dominated the banking and securities industries in the early 1900s.
   Milken is credited with reshaping American finance in the 1980s
through junk bonds used to provide billions of dollars in capital
to small- and medium-sized companies and to finance hostile
corporate takeovers.
   Junk bonds grew from an obscure form of debt to a $200 billion
market almost entirely because of Milken, who controlled a wide
network of buyers and sellers and wielded enormous power.
   Under an agreement with Drexel, Milken was paid more than $1.1
billion from 1983-87, including $550 million in 1987 alone.
   Milken, Drexel and others were accused by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in September 1988 with sweeping civil insider
trading charges.
   Drexel settled its case last year by pleading guilty to six
felonies and agreeing to pay $650 million in fines and restitution.
Drexel was required to sever ties with Milken, who quit last June
after 19 years at Drexel.
   Drexel itself collapsed and is liquidating after its parent
company defaulted on debt payments and filed for bankruptcy court
protection in February.

<HEAD>RJR Nabisco Reports Strong Operating Earnings Growth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. said operating
earnings from its tobacco and food businesses rose 50 percent
during the first quarter, although the company recorded a net loss
as it continued to pay down the debt from its $24.53 billion
leveraged buyout.
   RJR Nabisco said it lost $222 million during the quarter,
compared with a loss of $239 million in the same period a year
earlier. The privately-held company did not report per-share
results.
   The loss was attributed to interest costs from last year's
takeover of the food and tobacco firm by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co. RJR Nabisco reported $830 million in interest and debt expenses
for the quarter.
   However, the company said its operating income increased to $602
million from $402 million in the first three months of 1989.
   Sales rose to $3.2 billion from $2.93 billion a year earlier.
   RJR Nabisco said it was able to repay approximately $2.2 billion
of its debt during the quarter.
   The company's junk bonds advanced on the news as investors
reacted positively to the results _ particularly the strength of
RJR Nabisco's operating earnings. The bonds had slipped in recent
months amid concerns about the firm's cash flow, which is crucial
for paying down its debt.
   RJR Nabisco's 13.71 percent bonds due in 2007 rose } to 68&lsqb;,
while the company's 13.71 percent bonds due in 2009 rose | to 81|.
The securities closed down from their highs of the day, but
outperformed a lackluster junk bond market.
   The company reported a 15 percent gain in worldwide sales by its
R.J. Reynolds tobacco businesses to $1.86 billion. The company said
the decision to eliminate excess inventories in the second half of
1989 was largely responsible for the increase.
   The firm's cigarette brands include Winston, Salem and Camel.
   RJR Nabisco's food businesses reported sales of $1.34 billion,
up 3 percent from a year earlier despite the loss of several
product lines divested to help lower the company's debt load.
   The company's food divisions include Nabisco Brands Inc. and
Planters LifeSavers Co., and its products include Oreo cookies and
Ritz crackers, Planters nuts and LifeSavers candies.

   Coca-Cola Co.'s chief executive officer, Roberto
C. Goizueta, received $10.8 million in salary and other
compensation last year, making him the highest-paid CEO among the
nation's largest companies, a survey in Forbes magazine shows.
   The 58-year-old Goizueta leads a list of the highest-paid
executives to be featured in the May 14 issue, Forbes said Tuesday.
   The list is limited to executives from companies on Forbes
``Super 50'' ranking of the nation's largest companies as measured
by their sales, profits, assets and market value.
   Goizueta realized $5.9 million in stock gains, in addition to
$2.5 million in cash salary and bonus and other compensation of
$2.4 million during the year, the magazine said.
   Roger B. Smith of General Motors Corp., the nation's largest
company as measured by Forbes, ranked 22nd among the CEOs in total
pay, with $2.1 million.
   The lowest-paid CEO among the group was billionaire Laurence
Tisch of Loews Corp., whose total pay was $249,000 in 1989, the
magazine said.
   Eleven of the ``Super 50'' CEOs made more than $3 million last
year in total compensation.
   In addition to Goizueta, Forbes said the highest-paid CEOs were:
David D. Glass, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., $6.8 million; Hamish Maxwell,
Philip Morris Cos., $6.5 million; Maurice R. Greenberg, American
International Group, $5.1 million; David O. Maxwell, Federal
National Mortgage Association, $4.8 million; James W. Kinnear,
Texaco Inc., $3.94 million; Rand V. Araskog, ITT Corp., $3.93

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Down; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined against all major currencies
Tuesday except the Japanese yen, which weakened considerably.
   Gold prices finished lower at home after moving higher abroad.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for April delivery
settled at $375.90 a troy ounce, or $3 below Monday's close. Later,
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a troy ounce of gold
bullion at $375.75 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down $2.90 from Monday's late
bid.
   Foreign exchange dealers said trading was moderately active and
most of the attention was directed toward the yen. Japan's currency
slumped across the board, benefiting the West German mark, the
Swiss franc and other currencies.
   ``It was a yen story today. The yen resumed its terribly weak
posture,'' said Richard Levine, a vice president of foreign
exchange and precious metals at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   There was no fundamental news from Japan to account for the
heavy yen selling. Dealers said an underlying bearish outlook for
the yen, which had been temporarily suppressed, resurfaced. The low
level of that country's interest rates relative to those of its
trading partners accounts for some of the yen's troubles.
   The dollar's losses against everything but the yen came despite
a strong report on orders for durable goods. March bookings for
durables, which are expensive items designed to last three or more
years, posted the best showing in more than a year, jumping 6.7
percent.
   But the report had little influence on the dollar and traders
were said to be more interested in Friday's reading on the gross
national product, which will be the first comprehensive assessment
of economic activity during this year's first quarter.
   In European trading, the West German mark's move through 93.20
Japanese yen _ a key technical chart point _ kicked off a flurry of
activity. By late in the European day, the mark was quoted at about
93.67 yen, up from 92.92 yen late Monday. It had moved briefly
above 94 yen before retreating in late dealings.
   By late in London's afternoon, the dollar was quoted at 1.6930
marks, down from 1.6960 marks late Monday. It stood at 1.6980 marks
late in New York, lower than Monday's late level of 1.6995.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.60 yen to a closing 158.15
yen. It was quoted at a higher rate of 158.59 yen later in London.
In New York, the dollar ended at 158.95 yen, up from 157.55 yen on
Monday.
   Also in London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6345,
compared with $1.6365 late Monday. Later in New York, sterling
dipped to $1.6347 from $1.63565 on Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
quotes, included: 1.4875 Swiss francs, down from 1.4935; 5.698
French francs, down from 5.7020; 1,244.75 Italian lire, down from
1,246.75; and 1.15955 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16155.
   Selected dollar rates late in Europe compared with late Monday's
levels were: 1.4865 Swiss francs, down from 1.4925; 5.6795 French
francs, down from 5.6930; 1.9100 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9090;
1,241.00 Italian lire, down from 1,244.00; and 1.1590 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1610.
   Gold and silver both gained in European and Asian trading before
posting losses in the United States.
   In London, gold traded at a late bid of $378.25 a troy ounce, up
from $376.25 late Monday. In Zurich, the bid price was $377.50, up
from $375.85 late Monday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.99 to
close at a bid of $378.97.
   Silver's decline in U.S. trading brought the precious metal
below $5 an ounce. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery fell to $4.994 a troy ounce from Monday's settlement of
$5.093. Silver traded in London at a late bid price of $5.10 a troy
ounce, up from $5.09 late Monday.

<HEAD>Five Companies Form Software Group To Manage ``Corporate
Knowledge''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four major corporations and a computer software
company said Tuesday they formed an alliance to develop software
that will allow them to better manage ``corporate knowledge,'' or
the skills and know-how of their employees.
   The five companies _ Digital Equipment Corp., Ford Motor Co.,
Texas Instruments Inc., U S West Inc. and Carnegie Group Inc., a
Pittsburgh-based software company _ said they contributed $10
million to the initiative, which they began in 1988 but did not
announce at the time.
   The alliance, called the Initiative for Managing Knowledge
Assets, is aimed at developing a next-generation software that will
capture the skills and knowledge of a company's employees and make
it available to others through a computer system.
   ``The ability to manage these assets, just as companies manage
their capital or financial assets, is one of the most important
ways in which companies can retain a competitive advantage in our
increasingly competitive world,'' said Ted Smith, technical
director of U S West Advanced Technologies Inc., a division of the
Colorado-based regional phone company.
   Among knowledge skills of employees are design experience,
engineering skills, financial analysis, marketplace knowledge and
knowledge of a company's policies, practices and goals, the
alliance said.
   The group calls the computer technique it intends to develop
``knowledge processing.''
   The five companies said they will use the software they develop
in their own operations and sell products based on it. Smith
invited other companies to join the non-profit group.
   Smith said the companies hope the software they develop will
help them bring products to market faster and improve customer
service. The group already has spent a year in engineering
development of the software, it said.
   The group said it will use concepts developed in artificial
intelligence research, such as expert systems programs, but that
the software will not be an artificial intelligence application per
se.
   Artificial intelligence is a type of software than attempts to
mimic the way humans think. Expert systems programs attempt to
capture the knowledge of a human expert, such as an engineer or
doctor, and make it available through a programming technique
called inference, in which conclusions are drawn about a problem or
question through a series of logic questions, such as if-then
clauses.
   The companies said they decided to form the group after they
found nothing on the market to provide the type of computer program
they need.
   The group said it plans to have its core technology available
for testing by this fall.
   Michael L. Schneider, a computer analyst at the research firm
Gartner Group Inc., said the alliance represents the first time a
group of end-users of computer services has decided to set the
standards for a new computer technology at its infancy.
   Currently, he said, expert-systems programs are not
standardized. Under the software the group intends to develop, ``it
means everybody will be speaking the same language,'' which could
speed the growth of such programs, he said.
   Gibbs R. Moody, a software analyst at the San Francisco
brokerage Hambrecht &amp; Quist, said Texas Instruments, Digital, U S
West and Carnegie Group have been working on artificial
intelligence systems on their own.
   Moody said the alliance ``sounds like a small, significant step
but nothing earth-shattering.''

   Crude and heating oil futures declined and
gasoline futures advanced Tuesday on largely technical factors.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, slipped 7 cents to close at $19 a 42-gallon
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The May contract for delivery of home heating oil dropped 0.47
cent to settle at 52.65 cents a gallon.
   However, the May contract for unleaded regular gasoline advanced
0.85 cent to close at 64.39 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said crude oil futures opened higher in response to
gains on overseas markets, but prices fell back after meeting
resistance at about $19.50 a barrel.
   Gasoline futures continued to recover from recent low levels as
traders looked for and found bargains.
   Richard Redoglia, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures,
said there was no fundamental news to affect the market. He said
many traders were awaiting next month's meeting of OPEC's price
monitoring committee.
   The gathering was called by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries in hopes of shoring up oil prices that have
skidded as cartel members exceeded their production quotas.
   Oil analysts have estimated the 13-nation cartel is pumping more
than 24 million barrels of crude a day, well over its self-imposed
ceiling of 22.1 million barrels a day.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, natural gas for June delivery closed at
$1.555 per million British thermal units, unchanged from Monday.

<TEXT>
   Michael Milken, the billionaire financier who
reshaped Wall Street in the 1980s but fell in its biggest scandal,
pleaded guilty Tuesday to breaking federal securities and tax laws
and agreed to pay a record $600 million in penalties.
   Milken, 43, broke down and sobbed before the packed Manhattan
courtroom as he finished a lengthy statement outlining his crimes,
which included illegal trading with stock speculator Ivan Boesky
and others from 1984-86.
   ``I realize by my acts I have hurt those who are closest to me.
I am truly sorry,'' Milken said. He had to be supported by his
attorney and his voice cracked when he pleaded, ``Guilty, your
honor.''
   Milken faces a maximum 28 years in prison at his scheduled Oct.
1 sentencing before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, although legal
experts expect a term of around five years.
   The plea marked a stunning victory in the government's crackdown
on Wall Street crime that has included more than 30 convictions and
targeted Milken and his former employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., from its outset in 1986.
   Milken widely is regarded as the most important American
financier since J.P. Morgan Jr. in the early 1900s and he came to
symbolize the bounty and excesses of a booming Wall Street. His
personal fortune is said to exceed $1 billion.
   Milken pioneered the use of high-yield debt securities known as
junk bonds that gave small companies access to billions of dollars
in capital and also made possible the wave of hostile corporate
takeovers that characterized the dog-eat-dog 1980s.
   But his downfall began after he was linked to an insider trading
network by Boesky, who received a three-year prison term and was
fined $100 million in November 1986 to settle his own case.
   Milken was indicted on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering in
March 1989, but vigorously maintained his innocence. He reversed
course last week and agreed to the plea bargain, avoiding a long,
costly trial and the prospect of a much stiffer prison term.
   Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said in Washington that Milken's admissions
``demonstrate that he stood at the center of a network of
manipulation, fraud and deceit.''
   Milken pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud, mail
fraud, helping others violate federal securities regulations and
assisting in the filing of a false tax return.
   Far less severe than the original indictment, the counts do not
involve rackteering or unlawful securities trading based on inside
information. The racketeering charge carried a minimum 20-year
prison term and possible forfeiture of Milken's wealth.
   ``The charges are a far cry from the lurid, irresponsible and
prejudicial accusations against Michael that have been made by
anonymous sources to the press for the past 3{ years,'' Milken
attorney Arthur Liman said after the plea.
   ``It is Michael's hope that ... history will see his violations
in context and judge him not just on the basis of his lapses but on
the basis of the contributions that he made to the economy and to
the American people,'' he said.
   Under the settlement, Milken agreed to pay $200 million in fines
to the Justice Department and to $400 million for a civil fund for
reimbursing investors defrauded by his actions. The penalties are
the largest against an individual in U.S. history.
   The government dropped all charges against Milken's brother,
Lowell, who was named in the indictment. The status of former
Drexel trader Bruce Newberg, also part of the original case, was
not yet resolved.
   Milken also is required to cooperate with the government after
his sentencing. The deal settles civil SEC charges and bars Milken
permanently from the securities industry.
   ``We believe that this prosecution and the fact that Mr. Milken
has admitted to guilt will send the right message to the financial
community,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll told the court.
   Carroll said that after sentencing is completed, the public
``should conclude that justice has been done.''
   Milken, wearing a blue suit, white shirt and blue polka-dot tie,
was composed as he described the work of Drexel's Beverly Hills,
Calif.-based junk bond department and his unlawful actions. He
broke down in discussing his personal struggle during the four-year
investigation.
   In addition to conspiracy, Milken admitted to:
   _Violating federal disclosure requirements by failing to record
a deal compensating Boesky for trading losses in Fischbach Corp. in
1984. Boesky had acquired more than 10 percent of the takeover
target on Milken's recommendation and Milken promised to to cover
any trading losses.
   _Securities fraud involving the sale of MCA Inc. stock by Drexel
client Golden Nugget Inc. in the fall of 1984. Milken said he
arranged illegal trades to cover losses by Boesky, who agreed to
buy blocks of MCA stock to mask sales of large positions and create
the appearance of market demand.
   _Violating federal net capital standards by forcing Drexel to
buy more than 1 million shares in Helmerich &amp; Payne Corp. in early
1985 from Boesky's firm, which agreed to buy back the stock at a
later date. The transactions were not recorded on the books of
Boesky's Seemala Corp.
   Milken said he was not involved in buying the stock but learned
of it later and approved the deal.
   _Illegal securities trading with Drexel client David Solomon,
head of Solomon Asset Management, to recoup some commissions paid
by Drexel to a fund managed by Solomon in 1985 and 1986.
   _Creating short-term capital losses through a series of bond
transactions in American Adventure Inc. and Patient Technology Inc.
to benefit Solomon's personal income tax liability.
   Milken said his plea was an admission of personal responsibility
``and not a reflection of the underlying soundness and integrity of
the capital markets in which we specialized.''
   ``Our business was in no way dependent on these practices,'' he
said. ``Nor did they comprise a fundamental part of our business
and I regret them very much.''
   Junk bonds grew from an obscure form of debt to a $200 billion
market almost entirely because of Milken, who controlled a wide
network of buyers and sellers and wielded enormous power.
   The market virtually dried up last fall because of problems
involving several large defaults and Milken's departure from the
scene.
   Drexel settled related civil and criminal charges last year by
pleading guilty to six felonies and agreeing to pay $650 million in
fines and restitution. Milken quit Drexel last June after 19 years
to form his own consulting firm.
   Drexel itself collapsed and has been liquidating since its
parent company defaulted on debt payments and filed for bankruptcy
court protection in February.

<HEAD>Mobil, Texaco, Shell Report Earnings Declines; Chevron, Phillips
Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Corp. on Tuesday reported a 7 percent decline in net
income in the first quarter, mainly reflecting lower petrochemical
earnings, while Texaco Inc.'s net income plummeted 77.4 percent and
Shell Oil Co. posted a 44 percent decline.
   But Chevron Corp. said its first-quarter net income jumped 51
percent while Phillips Petroleum Co. reported a 36.3 percent
increase.
   Nearly all the companies said they benefitted from higher prices
of crude oil and natural gas during the quarter. In many cases, the
declines in net income were due to special accounting features,
while actual proceeds from oil and gas rose.
   Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company, said its
earnings slipped to $400 million, or 94 cents a share, from $429
million, or $1.04 a share, in the first quarter of 1989.
   New York-based Mobil said its chemical division had sharply
lower earnings, reflecting a worldwide drop in petrochemical prices
from record levels a year earlier. Earnings from petroleum
operations rose sharply, on the other hand, mainly due to higher
crude and gas prices.
   First-quarter revenue rose 6.4 percent to $14.9 billion from
$14.0 billion.
   Texaco, which ranks third behind Exxon Corp. and Mobil, said its
net income fell to $328 million, or $1.15 a share, from $1.45
billion, or $5.91 a share, in the first quarter of 1989. However,
results for the year-earlier quarter included a one-time net gain
of $1.19 billion resulting mainly from the sale of Texaco Canada
Inc.
   Excluding the restructuring gain, Texaco's first-quarter net
income rose 23.8 percent to $328 million from $265 million.
   ``Texaco's steady performance in the first quarter showed strong
(exploration and production) earnings reflecting the higher crude
oil and natural gas prices prevailing during the period,'' James W.
Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief executive, said. ``However,
there has been a weakening in these prices in the second quarter.''
   First-quarter revenue declined 4.7 percent to $9.16 billion from
$9.61 billion.
   Fourth-ranked Chevron credited its strong earnings performance
to a worldwide increase in the production of oil and gas. Net
income for the quarter jumped to $473 million, or $1.33 a share,
from $313 million, or 91 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Chevron's first-quarter revenue rose 20.8 percent to $9.3
billion from $7.7 billion.
   ``We were able to produce natural gas at record levels,
reflecting in part the development of Gulf of Mexico properties
purchased from Tenneco in 1988,'' said Chief Executive Officer Ken
Derr.
   The outlook for the second quarter remains unclear because of
continued volatility in crude prices, Derr said. Chevron, based in
San Francisco, also is working on finalizing several sales of
assets that could yield significant net gains this year.
   Shell, the sixth-largest U.S. oil company with headquarters in
Houston, is wholly owned by the Royal Dutch-Shell Group of
Companies, a British-Dutch enterprise. It does not report per-share
earnings.
   Shell said the drop in its first-quarter earnings _ to $203
million from $362 million _ was largely due to a $70 million
insurance settlement gained in the year-earlier quarter.
   Revenue increased 11.5 percent to $5.8 billion from $5.2 billion.
   Phillips, ranked eleventh, said its net income jumped to $259
million, or $1.06 a share, from $190 million, or 78 cents a share.
Earnings in the first quarter of this year include a net gain of
$148 million from an accounting change and other one-time features.
   Revenue rose 0.1 percent to $3.13 billion from $3.10 billion.

   The stock market stumbled Tuesday when a late
round of computer-triggered selling wiped out initial gains and
pushed the key index down for the fifth consecutive session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 12.17 to 2,654.50.
Since last Tuesday the index has lost 111.27 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
833 down, 652 up and 506 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 137.36 million
shares, up slightly from 135.15 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 169.11 million shares.
   Interest rates continued to be the market's key focus, with
stocks mirroring the credit market for much of the session.
   When bond prices advanced in the early going despite the
government's better-than expected report on March durable goods
orders, stocks advanced. But when bond prices faltered, their
yields rising in tandem, stocks struggled to hold onto initial
gains.
   An hour before the closing bell, computer-triggered sell
programs kicked in and took the stock market down. ``Given how
light the volume is, the market couldn't recover from that little
straw,'' said Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst at Kidder
Peabody &amp; Co.
   Higher interest rates lower stock valuations and make corporate
borrowing more expensive.
   Alfred E. Goldman, a vice president at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.
in St. Louis, called the market's performance ``a little
disappointing because it tried to go up _ both the generals and the
troops.''
   With plenty of cash on the sidelines, investors so far have not
had to dump blocks of stocks in order to buy bonds. But there is
concern that the selling of stocks could accelerate if yields go
higher.
   Government bonds yielding close to 9 percent proved an
attractive alternative to equities. ``It's a portfolio decision,''
Jarrett said, and ``it could have an impact on our market.''
   Some analysts were heartened that the selling was not heavy.
``It did not get nasty,'' said Goldman. He drew encouragement from
the fact that bond prices were down only fractionally, an
indication that the market seemed to be stabilizing.
   Ames Department Stores, the most actively traded Big Board issue
with 3.8 million shares changing hands, fell | to 1&rsqb;. The chain
hired a bankruptcy lawyer and was reported to be considering
seeking Chapter 11 protection from creditors.
   Elsewhere inthe retail sector, Sears was off 1&lsqb; at 35&rsqb;; the
company reported a 59 percent decline in first-quarter profits.
   Among other actively traded issues, IBM was down { at 108~;
Philip Morris was unchanged at 41|; Dupont was down } at 35, and
Chrysler was unchanged at 15~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $6.79 billion, or 0.21
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped 0.42 to 181.51.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index slipped 0.76 to 384.45, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index lost 0.69 at 330.36.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.89 to 419.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 343.89, down 1.06.

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   US Sprint and London-based Cable &amp;
Wireless PLC on Tuesday announced an international business phone
service, the first service to come out of a partnership they formed
last year.
   The companies said they will begin offering in September a
service that will allow customers in the United States, the United
Kingdom and Hong Kong to reach each other with seven-digit numbers,
eliminating the international calling codes usually needed.
   ``It will be just like making a local call,'' said Sprint
spokesman Jim Crawford. He said other countries would be added this
year to the system, called a virtual private network, but did not
name them.
   Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. long-distance company, and Cable &amp;
Wireless, a telecommunications company operating in 40 countries,
formed a partnership last year to offer joint telephone services.
The companies are joint owners of a trans-Atlantic fiber optic
phone cable.
   The next step in the partnership, Crawford said, will be phone
cards available later this year that will allow customers to charge
calls to and from participating countries. Sprint cards now only
allow customers to charge international calls made from the United
States, he said.
   Kansas City-based Sprint's side of the partnership will be
operated by its international subsidiary, Sprint International,
based in Reston, Va.
   Cable &amp; Wireless will operate the partnership through its
Mercury Communications Ltd. subsidiary in Great Britain at its Hong
Kong Telecom division.
   Howard McNally, director of AT&amp;T International Communications
Services, said AT&amp;T began offering a similar seven-digit dailing
service between Great Britain and the United States last June. He
said AT&amp;T would add more countries to that service before the end
of the year.
   NcNally said AT&amp;T cards already allows customers to charge calls
to the United States from 150 companies. Phone cards from MCI
Communications Corp., the No. 2 U.S. long-distance company after
AT&amp;T, also offer international calling to and from the United
States.

<HEAD>Ames Refuses Comment on Report That It Has Hired Bankruptcy
Specialist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE LAVOIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ames Department Stores Inc. maintained
silence on its financial woes Tuesday, refusing comment on a report
that it has hired a bankruptcy specialist to prepare a court filing
to protect Ames from creditors.
   William Roberts, an Ames spokesman, said the Rocky Hill-based
retailer would not comment on a report in The Hartford Courant that
said Ames has hired Michael Cook, a bankruptcy specialist at a
prominent New York law firm, to begin the paperwork for a filing
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Act.
   The filing would allow Ames to continue operating while trying
to work out a plan to repay its debts.
   Analysts said bringing in Cook indicates how deep the retailer's
fortunes have sunk since it acquired the Zayre discount chain in
late 1988.
   ``When you have a severe stomach ache, you go out and get
yourself the best gastric man you can, and at this point, they're
looking for someone to get them out of this pickle barrel,'' said
Alan Millstein, publisher of The Fashion Network Report, a monthly
newsletter for retailers and manufacturers.
   Jeffrey Branman, managing director for Financo Inc., a New York
investment bank that specializes in retail industry transactions,
said hiring a bankruptcy specialist could signal an irreversible
slide toward Chapter 11.
   ``It's a terrible sign because it means people are preparing for
it,'' said Branman. ``Once you start heading down the slippery
slope, it's hard to avoid (Chapter 11).''
   Ames bought 392 Zayre discount stores in late 1988, hoping to
solve their problems and convert them into a format similar to the
successful one used for Ames.
   Instead, Ames has been suffering from major losses and cash flow
shortages since then, and has been trying to negotiate new
financing with its bankers since announcing two weeks ago it would
post a loss of about $228 million for the fiscal year that ended
Jan. 27.
   Ames officials have maintained a strict silence for the last two
weeks on the company's financial problems, and continued that
stance Tuesday.
   ``All I can tell you is we're having discussions that are
continuing with our bankers,'' said Roberts.
   Roberts also refused comment on reports that some manufacturers
have suspended shipments to Ames because they fear they will not be
paid.
   The Gitano Group Inc., a New York-based manufacturer of jeans
and sportswear, confirmed Tuesday that it had stopped shipments to
Ames about three weeks ago when it became concerned about reports
of the company's cash flow problems.
   ``We've taken some pro-active steps to reduce our exposure with
Ames,'' Gitano President Haim Dabah said. ``We have stopped
shipping goods until the dust clears.''
   Another supplier, Pepsi-Cola Co. _ the soft drink division of
Pepsico Inc. _ denied earlier reports that it has refused to
deliver to Ames unless it is paid in cash.
   Tod MacKenzie, a spokesman for Pepsi-Cola, said Tuesday that the
company is still making regular deliveries to Ames. ``It's business
as usual with Ames,'' he said.
   Retail analysts said Ames made a number of mistakes in the Zayre
acquisition, problems that were intensified by a sluggish retail
environment in the Northeast, where many of the stores are located.
   Sales at the Zayre stores have plummeted in recent months,
causing a major cash shortage for Ames.
   The Courant reported that Ames's discussions with its bankers
have deteriorated, leaving the company little choice but to seek
refuge in bankruptcy court.
   Roberts, however, insisted that the talks are continuing.
   According to the Courant, 20 institutions that own about $100
million of Ames's bonds have formed a committee, hired a financial
adviser, and proposed that they meet with the company's investment
bankers to begin negotiating a repayment plan or debt restructuring.
   The Courant also reported that Citibank, the lead bank in a
group of 20 that has granted $900 million of credit to Ames, has
hired Keen Realty Consultants of Long Island, N.Y., to begin
evaluating the value of leases Ames holds on its 680 discount
department stores. The retailer operates stores in 20 states and
Washington.
   Analysts said Ames still has a chance to avoid bankruptcy if
some agreement can be reached in the next few days for the
company's banks to provide cash to the retailer.

<HEAD>Insurance, Merchandising Losses Send Sears Earnings Skidding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First-quarter earnings at Sears, Roebuck and Co.
plunged nearly 59 percent because of higher-than-normal catastrophe
claims for Allstate Insurance Group and a loss in the Sears
Merchandise Group, the company said Tuesday.
   Sears reported first-quarter net income of $106.3 million, or 31
cents per share, compared with $257.7 million, or 70 cents per
share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 3.7 percent fo $12.61 billion from $12.16 billion
in 1989, with all business groups reporting record revenue.
   Sears Merchandise Group lost $37.4 million in the first quarter
of 1990, compared with income of $33.8 million for the same period
last year, despite a 1.3 percent increase in revenue.
   ``Although lower merchandising results were expected, pressure
on gross margins as well as higher selling costs resulted in an
unsatisfactory performance,'' said Sears chairman Edward A. Brennan
in a news release.
   The revenue increase was offset by rising payroll costs, added
spokesman Douglas A. Fairweather.
   Allstate reported first-quarter income of $193.2 million,
compared with $243.9 million in the first quarter of 1989.
   ``Those losses were mostly due to the earthquake (in California)
and the freezes in late 1989 in the Southwest and the Southeast,''
Fairweather said.
   ``With events like that, you can't really get a totally accurate
handle on your costs immediately,'' he said. ``In the case of a
freeze, you have to wait for a thaw to assess damages, and the thaw
came in the first quarter of this year.''
   The Dean Witter Financial Services Group had first-quarter
income of $60.7 million, up 62 percent from last year. That
increase was sparked by a 76 percent jump in income from Discover
Card operations, to $35.4 million.
   The Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group reported a loss of $33.5
million, compared with a loss of $16.2 million loss in the first
three months of last year.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Futures Slide On Interest Rate Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metal futures prices fell Tuesday, reflecting a general
lack of investor interest in gold and silver in the face of rising
interest rates.
   On other commodity markets, copper futures rose sharply, grains
and soybeans retreated; energy futures were mixed; and livestock
and meat futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $3 to $3.10 lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in April at $375.90 a troy
ounce; silver was 10 cents lower across the board with May at about
$5 a troy ounce.
   Platinum futures fell $6.50 across the board on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for July delivery settled
at $487.80 a troy ounce.
   The retreat followed a strong rally Monday in the platinum
market, which was linked to speculation that South African
political activist Nelson Mandela was preparing to take a more
militant stance against apartheid, posing a threat of possible
platinum supply disruptions.
   The Mandela rumors were discounted Tuesday and as platinum
futures fell, the gold and silver markets followed, said William
O'Neill, research director with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   The gold and silver markets kept tumbling, though, even after
platinum selling dwindled. O'Neill said the weak tone reflected the
outlook for higher interest rates, which tends to discourage
investor demand for precious metals.
   Government bonds yields of close to 9 percent are ``a major
negative for the precious metals,'' O'Neill said.
   ``Some of the optimism about rates that existed a few weeks ago
is completely by the boards now,'' he said, nurturing a bearish
attitude that is ``steadily weighing on and eroding the precious
metals.''
   Copper futures climbed strongly on the Commodity Exchange amid a
resurgence of buying interest by copper users on indications of
tight supplies of the metal available for delivery against the
April contract, which expires Thursday.
   Further buying was inspired by a report that officials of
Chile's Codelco copper company had lowered their estimate for 1990
production from the country's state-owned copper mines to 1.2
million to 1.25 million tons from an earlier estimate of 1.29
million tons.
   Copper futures settled 1.8 cents to 4.9 cents higher with April
at $1.24 a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell substantially on the
Chicago Board of Trade, led by a technically inspired sell-off in
the soybean market, analysts said.
   Wheat futures settled 2{ cents to 5 cents lower with May at
$3.67} a bushel; corn was { cent to 2 cents lower with May at $2.76
a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1\ cents lower with May at $1.57 a
bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 7\ cents lower with May at $5.98{
a bushel.
   Oil futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange
ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly stocks report.
The report, released after the close, showed an expected increase
in U.S. refinery activity, a fairly large 1.2-million-barrel
increase in U.S. crude oil stocks, a 926,000-barrel drop in
gasoline stocks and a 752,000-barrel decline in heating oil stocks.
   The build in crude stocks extends a pattern of oversupply that
has been linked to overproduction by the OPEC nations. But the
higher refinery activity is a seasonal factor that may offset the
market impact of the rise in oil stocks.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 14
cents higher with June at $19 a barrel; heating oil was .47 cent
lower to .30 cent higher with May at 52.65 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .15 cent to .85 cent higher with May at 64.39 cents a
gallon.
   Cattle futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
amid weaker cash markets for cattle and beef; pork futures ended
mixed on profit taking after Monday's strong gains.
   Live cattle settled .35 cent to .95 cent lower with June at
73.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .75 cent lower
with April at 83.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .28 cent lower to
.12 cent higher with June at 61.82 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .65 cent lower to .50 cent higher with May at 64.40
cents a pound.

   Michael Milken's future cooperation with
federal investigators is expected to yield valuable information for
other cases, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission
said Tuesday.
   But Richard Breeden declined to specify the particular areas in
which investigators would seek information from the financier, who
hours earlier pleaded guilty to tax and securities law crimes as
part of a plea bargain with the government.
   ``This case clearly does involve some significant
ramifications,'' Breeden told a news conference. ``We do expect
that the testimony and cooperation that we will receive will be
valuable in the context of other ongoing proceedings and
proceedings that may be commenced.''
   Milken, former head of the high-yield ``junk'' bond operation of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., also agreed to cooperate with
investigators under the plea bargain that settled the wide-ranging
criminal indictment against he and his brother, Lowell.
   The deal also settles civil charges brought by the SEC, which
barred both Milkens permanently from the securities business.
   Michael Milken will pay fines and restitution totaling $600
million, including $400 million to a civil fund for reimbursing
investors defrauded by his actions, and faces up to 28 years
imprisonment.
   Breeden said that under Milken's agreement the financier might
have to take the witness stand in other proceedings that might stem
from his cooperation with prosecutors.
   There has been speculation that one area of interest would be
the thrift industry, where a number of troubled institutions were
clients of Milken and Drexel. Breeden was asked whether the
government's probe would extend to Milken's dealings with the
thrifts, but said he could not specify how investigators would use
the information Milken provided.
   He said both the SEC and Justice Department expected much of the
information generated by their investigations of the Milkens would
prove useful.
   ``...But I would not be willing speculate on which specific
cases or what area of the financial market they might involve,''
Breeden said.
   In its civil case, the SEC in September 1988 accused Milken, his
brother, Lowell, and several others of a scheme that included
allegations of insider trading, securities fraud and other
violations.
   Among other allegations, the SEC charged that Milken and Drexel
had ``a secret arrangement'' with Ivan Boesky, the convicted stock
speculator who linked them to his insider trading network.
   ``Mr. Milken has been portrayed as wrongly accused, and as
having simply devoted himself to the financing of small or emerging
business,'' Breeden said, noting the public relations campaigns
Milken and Drexel had waged in fighting the government's charges.
   ``Despite the efforts to mold public opinion, Mr. Milken's
admissions today demonstrate that he stood at the center of a
network of manipulation, fraud and deceit,'' said Breeden.
   ``The key question is always `Does the penalty fit the crime?'''
said Breeden. ``In this case we are extremely pleased with the
result. We're extremely pleased with an admission of six felonies
and the potential here that the perpetrator of these crimes will
face up to 28 years in prison. We think that's a good settlement.''
   He said if the case had gone to trial, it would have taken years
before victims saw any compensation.
   Breeden also noted that Milken faces up to 28 years in prison
and ``contrary to some reports, the government will not recommend
concurrent sentences.''

<HEAD>USW Opposes Icahn's USX Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Steelworkers of America said
Tuesday it opposed Carl Icahn's proposal to break up USX Corp.'s
steel and energy assets.
   ``The Icahn proposal would represent, in our view, another
erroneous step away from USX's traditional corporate purpose,'' the
union said in a statement.
   ``The USWA believes that such a step is not in the long-term
interest ofthe employees or shareholders of USX.''
   Icahn, USX's largest shareholder, has proposed spinning off the
company's steel business, saying two separate companies will be
worth more than one to shareholders. The plan will be put to a
non-binding vote of stockholders at the company's annual meeting
May 7 in Findlay, Ohio.
   The union's statement was approved April 18 by 46 union local
presidents representing 18,000 members employed by USX. It was
reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission before being
released.
   ``The Icahn proposal, in our view, would continue the USX's
steady surrender of its interest in steel production _ creating a
weaker steel company which would be far more susceptible to
cyclical downturns in the economy and less able to modernize and
profit substantially during upturns,'' the statement said.

   Here are the six federal securities and tax law
violations outlined in financier Michael Milken's guilty plea in
U.S. District Court on Tuesday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COUNT ONE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Conspiracy.
   The government said Milken, former stock speculator Ivan F.
Boesky, Drexel client David Solomon of Solomon Asset Management and
others conspired to violated federal tax and securities laws.
   The conspiracy involved transactions detailed in the five other
counts, including illegal stock trades hidden from federal
regulators, secret records kept separate from Drexel's official
books, tax evasion and federal securities rules violations.
   The government said Milken and the others profited from
transactions while investors were cheated.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COUNT TWO</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Aiding and abetting the filing of false documents with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The government said the violation was designed to help Boesky by
concealing his stock holdings in Fischbach Corp., a construction
business that was the subject of a takeover attempt by Pennsylvania
Engineering Corp.
   Milken admitted that he failed to record a deal compensating
Boesky for trading losses in Fischbach from April 1984 to February
1985. Boesky had acquired more than 10 percent of Fischbach on
Milken's recommendation and Milken promised to to cover any trading
losses.
   The government said Boesky lost several million dollars buying
Fischbach stock, which Drexel more than made up for under the
secret arrangement.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COUNT THREE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Securities fraud.
   Milken admitted to arranging a secret purchase by Boesky of MCA
Corp. stock held by Drexel client Golden Nugget Inc. from March to
November 1984.
   Golden Nugget, a Las Vegas-based casino operator, had purchased
$99 million in MCA stock during a planned takeover of the
entertainment giant. the government said Milken induced Boesky to
buy about 875,000 shares of MCA stock to try to hide from the
market that Golden Nugget was dumping its position.
   The move was designed to prop up the price of MCA stock, which
would have fallen if word of the large sales by Golden Nugget
became public. Boesky's illegal purchases created the false
appearance of wide market demand.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COUNT FOUR</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Aiding and abetting the violation of SEC reporting requirements
for broker-dealers.
   The government said Drexel in 1985 bought about 1 million shares
of Helmerich &amp; Payne Corp. stock worth more than $20 million from
Boesky and agreed to hold the stock for Boesky, who in turn
promised to to make up any losses suffered by Drexel. Drexel later
sold some of the stock back to Boesky.
   The deal allowed Boesky to cheat on his taxes, free up cash to
buy more stock and overstate the amount of net capital in his
Seemala Corp., the government said. By failing to report the stock
sales, Milken helped Boesky violate federal laws, the government
said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COUNT FIVE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Mail fraud.
   Milken said he persuaded Solomon to become a manager for
Finsbury Group Ltd., a Drexel-organized international investment
fund.
   Drexel's junk bond department in Beverly Hills, Calif., paid
fees to salesmen who marketed the Finsbury shares, and Solomon then
funneled money back to the junk bond department by setting up deals
between Drexel and Solomon's clients.
   The government said Milken adjusted transaction prices to
provide cash that could go back to Drexel, but Solomon's clients
were kept in the dark about the arrangement. The arrangement
involved transactions from 1984 to 1986.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COUNT SIX</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Aiding and abetting the filing of a false tax return.
   Milken admitted setting up prearranged trades that allowed
Solomon to claim short-term capital losses and reduce his 1985 tax
liability.
   Milken and Solomon set up the deal with an understanding that
Milken would pay back Solomon for his losses the following year.
Milken in 1986 let Solomon acquire a limited partnership interest
that Solomon sold for a profit that was higher than the earlier,
bogus losses, the government said.

<TEXT>
   While friends and family watched, Michael
Milken's voice stumbled and cracked as one of the financial world's
most prominent figures confronted his own words: guilty.
   It was a stunning and poignant moment of truth even for veteran
visitors to Manhattan federal court, where towering figures ranging
from John Mitchell to Leona Helmsley have been digested and spit
out as felons.
   ``It's a tragedy to see history's greatest financier so
humbled,'' said Theodore Wells, a prominent defense attorney and
one of many Milken supporters who witnessed his admission that he
broke the law.
   ``I believe there was an injustice done,'' said Lorraine Spurge,
a longtime Milken colleague at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk
bond department in Beverly Hills, Calif., who works at his new
consulting firm. ``I believe he is a very brave man.''
   The atmosphere was hushed and solemn. Spectators sat on the edge
of the benches, straining to hear Milken sobbingly plead guilty to
six charges securities and tax law violations.
   About 250 reporters, sketch artists, lawyers and friends waited
for more than an hour in the hallway and then crammed into the U.S.
District Court in lower Manhattan.
   It was the same courtroom in which Milken, flanked by his
attorneys, Arthur Liman and Martin Flumenbaum, pleaded innocent to
a 98-count racketeering and fraud indictment on March 29, 1989.
   Then, Milken promised to fight what he called spurious
allegations through the criminal justice system. On Tuesday, he did
the opposite.
   The 43-year-old son of an accountant entered the courtroom from
a rear door and answered in a firm voice Judge Kimba Wood's
questions about whether he understood he was giving up his
constitutional right to a jury trial.
   It was later, when Milken ended his 10-minute statement to the
court with an apology, that he broke down in sobs.
   ``This investigation and proceeding are now in their fourth
year,'' he said, choking on the words. ``This long period has been
extremely painful and difficult for my family and friends as well
as myself.''
   Liman placed his hand on Milken's back to support the fallen
financier. Milken then slumped into a chair and took a few minutes
to compose himself, sipping water from a plastic foam cup.
   He stood again, and Wood asked: ``Mr. Milken, how do you plead
to the charges ... guilty or not guilty?''
   Milken's voice cracked on the first word. ``Guilty, your honor.''
   ``After being charged with 98 counts and four years of being
harassed, it's very difficult for anyone to stand that kind of
situation,'' Martin Klein, a bankruptcy attorney and Milken friend,
said later.
   The only levity occurred when Wood asked Assistant U.S. Attorney
John Carroll whether the $600 million Milken agreed to pay covered
the cost of the government's investigation.
   ``If you see my W-2 form, it does by a long shot,'' Carroll
said, prompting some laughter.
   Milken's arrival and departure from the courthouse were
chronicled by a throng of photographers and camera crews lining the
courthouse's steps.
   Milken _ with wife Lori on his arm _ appeared dazed as he
stepped out of his black car. Several marshals helped the couple
through the crush, shoving away photographers who surged forward.
   Other family members in court were Milken's mother, his
father-in-law and his brother, Lowell, who was cleared of all
wrongdoing as part of the plea deal.
   On the courthouse steps, one young man who said he worked in the
financial sector but declined to give his name said he was a Milken
fan. ``He's a financial wizard,'' he said. ``He just got greedy.''

<HEAD>First-Qtr Profit Declines at USX, Bethlehem Steel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. said Tuesday its first-quarter profit fell 40 percent
from results that included one-time gains a year ago, while
Bethlehem Steel Corp. reported its earnings for the quarter tumbled
67.1 percent.
   USX, a Pittsburgh-based oil and steel giant, said it earned $176
million, or 66 cents per share, in the latest three months compared
with $296 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier.
   Its sales rose 4.4 percent to $4.7 billion from $4.5 billion a
year earlier.
   Reults for the first quarter of 1989 included favorable special
items of $197 million in operating income and a $74 million pre-tax
gain from asset disposals, the company said.
   ``Excluding these 1989 special items, income before tax improved
by $71 million from the first quarter of last year,'' Chairman
Charles Corry said in a statement.
   He said the company's Marathon Oil subsidiary had a strong
quarter, while the company's steel operations improved as the
quarter progressed.
   ``Our steel order book has been stronger than anticipated since
the end of February,'' he said.
   Corry said first-quarter results demonstrate the success of a
restructuring program that began a decade ago.
   ``The energy and steel combination that has emerged has
permitted the company to perform well under widely varying business
conditions ... Steel earned more operating income than energy in
1988 and in 1989 the reverse was true,'' he said.
   Carl Icahn, USX's largest shareholder, wants to spin off the
company's steel business, saying two separate companies will be
worth more than one.
   The plan will be put to a non-binding vote of USX stockholders
at the company's May 7 annual meeting in Findlay, Ohio.
   USX's operating income for the first quarter was $354 million,
compared with $514 million in the first quarter of 1989.
   USX's energy segment reported operating income of $237 million
on sales of $3.3 billion in the first quarter. That compared with
operating income of $388 million on sales of $2.8 billion in the
same period last year.
   USX's steel segment reported first-quarter operating income of
$60 million on sales of $1.3 billion. In the first quarter of last
year, the segment posted operating income of $99 million on sales
of $1.5 billion.
   The declines in steel operating income and sales were primarily
attributed to lower steel prices and the effects of the sale of
Lorain Works in Ohio to a 50 percent-owned joint venture in the
second quarter of last year, USX said.
   Bethlehem Steel said slumping steel markets and higher operating
costs resulted in the decline in its profit.
   The Bethlehem, Pa.-based company said it had net income of $21.3
million, or 20 cents per share, in the quarter, down from $64.7
million, or 78 cents a share, a year ago.
   Net sales fell to $1.22 billion from $1.40 billion last year.
   Steel shipments were 19 percent lower than a year ago and raw
steel production dropped to 70 percent of capacity from 82 percent.
Income from basic steel operations was $29 million this past
quarter, compared with $137 million for the same period last year.
   ``Steel demand was particularly strong in early 1989, and the
lower shipments in the first quarter of 1990 resulted from weaker
demand, primarily from the construction and automotive markets,
reduced shipments of semifinished steel to other steel producers,
and competitive pressures in the structural products market,''
chairman Walter F. Williams said in a statement.
   Increased costs were attributable to modernization and repair
projects at the Sparrows Point plant and blast furnace
interruptions at Burns Harbor, the company said.
   A new contract with the United Steelworkers of America that
began June 1, 1989 boosted employment costs, the company said.

   A House panel on Tuesday approved legislation
to relax restrictions on the sale of computers and other high-tech
items to Eastern Europe.
   ``At a time when an already impatient Germany is reunifying,
merging Europe's greatest industrial power with the nation that had
the closest ties to the Soviets, we must reconsider the structure
of our export control system,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.,
chairman of the House subcommittee on international economic policy
and trade.
   The measure, which now goes to the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, would allow the sale of many items, but it would draw a
clear line between munitions and other technologies.
   It would also clarify the role of the Defense Department and it
would increase penalties for willful violation of the act.

   The government has decided to allow Michelin

<HEAD>Senators Back Bill to Consolidate Housing Program Grants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Northeast senators said Tuesday they would
sponsor a bipartisan bill combining nine major housing programs
into a single grant that would be distributed to states and cities.
   Sens. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Chris Dodd, D-Conn., said
they were offering their proposal as a way to speed up
rehabilitation and construction of subsidized housing and give
local governments more control.
   Their proposal ran into a cool reception from Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Jack Kemp.
   Kemp's spokeswoman, Mary Brunette, said the idea was ``kind of
at odds with our approach.'' She said giving the money directly to
local governments comes as HUD is seeking greater federal oversight
over local public housing authorities.
   Their proposal would combine money from nine categorical HUD
programs into a new Housing Grant Action Program. The consolidated
programs include the 202 elderly and handicapped housing program,
the scandal-plagued moderate rehabilitation program, public and
Indian housing programs, and the Housing Development Action Grant
program.
   They program would not provide increased federal money but would
continue them at current levels, totaling $7.1 billion. The money
would be distributed by formula, with 70 percent to local
governments and 30 percent to states.

<HEAD>1st-Qtr Profit Down 33 Percent at Times Mirror as Ad Revenue Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Times Mirror Corp. said Tuesday its
first-quarter profit fell 33 percent, largely because of an
advertising slowdown that hit its Northeastern newspapers, consumer
magazines and broadcast TV operations.
   For the quarter ending April 1, Times Mirror's earnings fell to
$46 million, or 36 cents per share, down from $68.8 million, or 53
cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenues rose 3.3 percent to $875.2 million from $846.9 million.
   But Times Mirror said its slide in earnings was partially
attributable to higher promotional costs and higher circulation
that pushed up operating costs at the Los Angeles Times.
   ``Although our professional publishing and cable television
operations achieved solid earnings growth during the quarter, their
performance only partially offset the marked deterioration in our
newspaper publishing segment,'' said Robert F. Erburu, Times
Mirror's chairman and chief executive.
   Ad volume was slow at the Northeastern newspapers, with Newsday
and New York Newsday suffering from a depressed New York economy,
Times Mirror said. The 1990 first quarter also had one less Sunday
than the year-earlier period, which reduced revenues.
   Despite increased revenues at the Los Angeles Times, a surge in
circulation increased operating costs, contributing to a 38 percent
decline in operating profit from newspapers.
   Times Mirror said its companywide circulation, as reported to
the Audit Bureau of Circulations but not yet verified, rose 4.1
percent for the daily papers and 3.2 percent on Sunday over the
past six months.
   At the Los Angeles Times, daily circulation during the same
period rose by 8.1 percent to 1,210,077, with Sunday circulation up
5.7 percent to 1,504,540, the company said. Publisher David
Laventhol estimated half the increase was from former readers of
the now-closed Herald Examiner.
   New York Newsday grew by 11.6 percent to 217,514 daily
circulation during the six months, and The Hartford (Conn.) Courant
reported a 2.2 percent rise to 230,358, the company said.
   Although consumer magazines also were affected by the
advertising slowdown, the book, magazine and other publishing
segment still had a 13.6 percent increase in quarterly revenues and
21.7 percent growth in operating profit due to gains by the legal
publishing, flight information and training businesses.

   Bond prices finished mixed Tuesday, as
short-term issues declined while longer-term issues were unchanged
to slightly higher.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond edged up 1-32 point,
or 31 cents for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls
when prices rise, slipped to 8.95 percent from 8.96 percent late
Monday.
   Through Monday, the 30-year bond had plunged more than $41 per
$1,000 over seven trading days in response to signs of increasing
inflation, a stronger economy and worries about upcoming bond
issues, including the Treasury's quarterly refunding auction set
for next month.
   Higher inflation and an economic upturn could prompt the Federal
Reserve to keep interest rates high. Higher rates erode the value
of fixed-return investments such as bonds.
   Analysts said bond prices recovered Tuesday morning but later
were driven lower by unconfirmed rumors that the Fed planned to
tighten interest rates in the near future.
   Jay Goldinger, a principal of Capital Insight Inc. in Beverly
Hills, Calif., described the market as ``very jittery''.
   ``Behind every buyer they think there's the ghost of another
seller,'' he said.
   The government reported Tuesday that orders to U.S. factories
for du part of a personal
vendetta within the commission staff.
   Stello, in two confirmation appearances before the Senate Armed
Services Committee last fall, strongly denied that he acted
improperly. He asserted that nuclear safety was his primary concern
in 24 years as a regulator.
   The Armed Services Committee had been set to recommend Stello's
confirmation in January but balked upon learning that he was the
focus of an investigation by David Williams, the inspector general
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   Williams is investigating allegations that Stello and other
officials pursued a vendetta against Roger Fortuna, a commission
official in charge of investigating wrongdoing at nuclear plants.
The allegation was that Stello felt Fortuna was too hard on the
industry.
   The results of the Williams probe have not been made public, but
in his letter to Bush, Stello noted that the Armed Services
Committee planned to hold up further consideration of his
nomination until it reviewed the results of Williams' investigation.
   ``My experience over this past year has lead me to the
conclusion that final action by the Senate on my nomination will
not take place in the foreseeable future,'' he wrote.
   Stello also wrote that ``aspects of my personal health'' also
played a role in his decision. He suffered serious injuries in a
skiiing accident in January.
   ``This accident has given me an opportunity to more sharply
focus on those matters which I consider of significant personal
importance,'' he wrote without elaborating.
   Stello said he believed it was important that Bush find someone
who can quickly be confirmed in the job of weapons chief, in order
that work under way to resuscitate the aging bomb-production
complex not be hindered by political bickering.
   ``In my view, it is in the interest of our country for you to
identify another nominee for this critical position,'' he wrote.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins had no immediate comment on
Stello's decision to withdraw, said Catherine Kaliniak, a
department spokeswoman.
   Last fall, Watkins told the Armed Services Committee at the
outset of Stello's confirmation hearings that he could find no
other qualified individual willing to take the job, which he called
``one of the toughest jobs in government.''
   Olson said he could not comment on whether Watkins had found a
nominee to replace Stello.

<HEAD>Santa Fe Pacific to Spin Off Oil, Realty Subsidiaries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Santa Fe Pacific Corp. said Tuesday it plans to
spin off its energy and real estate subsidiaries to shareholders by
the end of the year, leaving the company focused on its railroad
operations.
   The company plans to sell its stake of over 80 percent in Santa
Fe Energy Resources and Santa Fe Realty Co. in the third quarter of
this year, Orval Adam, vice president and chief financial officer,
said at the company's annual shareholder meeting.
   ``We've been trying to separate those companies so shareholders
would have the benefit of separate management and separate
investment possibilities,'' Adam said.
   ``We've had a gas and oil exploration company, a real estate
company and a railroad. When you invest in a company, you like to
know what you're investing in. If you want to invest in real
estate, your money should go into real estate.''
   The spinoffs are contingent on the company refinancing a $780
million payment-in-kind debenture and a ruling from the Internal
Revenue Service that the spinoffs constitute a tax-free dividend,
the company said.
   Santa Fe Pacific will continue to operate the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railway.
   The spinoffs are unrelated to recent poor performance by the
railroad, which announced Monday it would lay off 850 workers
nationwide due to downturns in shipments of automobiles and grain,
Adam said.
   ``The last couple of months here have not been up to snuff and
we're looking toward making some expense cuts,'' Adam said.
   ``But the spinoff has been a longer-term objective in our
restructuring. Poor performance in one month or a couple of months
won't affect that.''
   Santa Fe Pacific Realty, a San Francisco-based developer, holds
about 2 million acres of developed and undeveloped land in 13
states, Adam said.
   The company holds 10.7 million square feet of developed
industrial, office and retail space, has 1.8 million square feet
under construction, he said. It plans to develop nearly 27 million
square feet in the next five years, he added.
   Santa Fe Energy Resources, based in Houston, is an independent
oil and gas company. It had reserves of 251 million barrels of oil
equivalent at the end of 1989, Adam said. Daily production in 1989
averaged more than 50,000 barrels of oil and almost 82 million
cubic feet of natural gas, he said.
   Following the spinoffs, Santa Fe Pacific will continue to own
and operate the railway and Santa Fe Pacific Minerals Corp., and
will retain its 44 percent interest in Santa Fe Pacific Pipeline
Partners, Adam said.
   After the stockholders meeting, Richard D. Foley, chairman of
the American Employees Stock Ownership Association, announced the
filing of a shareholder suit against the company.
   The suit seeks recovery of fees and costs arising from a proxy
fight in 1988 protesting the company's shareholder rights plan. The
fight resulted in a revision of the plan that would allow fully
financed offers if they receive approval from 80 percent of the
shareholders.
   Jerome F. Donohoe of Santa Fe Pacific's legal department said
the company had rejected a request from Foley for about $600,000 in
fees and costs.

   McMeel testified at the trial over the Times Herald's $33
million antitrust lawsuit against the Morning News. The Times
Herald said the UPS deal with the Morning News unfairly turned over
to its larger competitor features and comics that included
Doonesbury, Dear Abby and Erma Bombeck.
   McMeel said he made his request as UPS was negotiating a joint
television venture with the Morning News and its parent company,
A.H. Belo Corp.
   Although Morning News Editor Burl Osborne for years had been
inquiring about the availability of two UPS comics _ Doonesbury and
The Far Side, which were appearing in the Times Herald _ McMeel
said he would consider the joint venture only if the newspaper took
all 26 features.
   ``I had to make it very plain,'' McMeel said. ``I was not going
to just take two features out of the Dallas Times Herald. I just
wasn't going to do it. This (television opportunity) was a project
we had been waiting for. I said everything had to get out so we can
evaluate the whole package.''
   The Times Herald is seeking $33 million in actual damages, plus
unspecified punitive damages in the trial, which is in its fourth
week. The case is expected to go to the jury next week.
   The Times Herald contends the comics transfer was a deliberate
move by The Morning News and Belo to build a monopoly in Dallas and
drive the Times Herald out of business. The Morning News and Belo
have denied any wrongdoing.
   The joint venture, known as Universal Belo, is producing
television programs based on characters appearing in comic strips
syndicated by Kansas City-based UPS.
   In his second day of testimony, McMeel said competing syndicates
already were involved in television programming and the joint
venture was ``a matter of survival.''
   McMeel said he also feared a ``hostile environment'' at the
Times Herald if UPS canceled only Doonesbury and The Far Side.
Asked if the loss of the features could help close the newspaper,
he replied: ``Absolutely not.''
   McMeel said the Times Herald was not given a chance to bid on
the television project because the venture was breaking new ground.
   ``The objective was to create an entity and you don't bid on an
entity,'' he said. ``This was something new.''
   Under cross examination by Times Herald attorney Wayne Fisher,
McMeel said he could not enter a television deal with Belo while
UPS features remained in the Times Herald.
   ``Belo Corp. was not going to be enthusiastic about superstars
being created across the street at the Dallas Times Herald,'' he
said.
   Fisher tried to show that at the time the joint venture
discussions took place, the features remained under contract with
the Times Herald. He also alleged that Osborne proposed the
transfer, but McMeel disputed that contention.

<HEAD>Tampa CPA Named GDC Examiner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge named an examiner to
probe some of the tangled affairs of General Development Corp.,
which has admitted overpricing homes and deceiving buyers about
their value.
   The examiner is Kathleen Durdin, a certified public accountant
and a vice president of Peterson and Company, a Tampa managment
consulting firm.
   David Bird, assistant U.S. Trustee for the Southern District of
Florida, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge A. Jay Cristol on Tuesday that
the GDC creditors' committee settled on Durdin after interviewing
11 applicants Monday.
   General Development filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy April 6,
claiming a severe cash shortage after failing to secure $60 million
in short-term credit.
   The Miami-based developer and its two top executives pleaded
guilty last month in federal court to mail-fraud conspiracy for
overpricing thousands of homes and lying to the buyers.
   Last week, Cristol approved a plan that allows GDC to receive
$10.5 million in temporary financing for six weeks while it
arranges permanent financing. General Development already owes $175
million to the eight banks who guaranteed the interim financing.
   In making the appointment official, Cristol said Ms. Durdin
``was not to take over the management or the creditors committee''
of GDC but was to work with the court-appointed officials to bring
about a reorganization.
   Cristol also said he has recommended that U.S. District Judge
Lenore Nesbitt, who is scheduled to sentence GDC officials and the
company on May 22, delay sentencing until after July 4 to allow
more time for the formulation of a restitution agreement.

<HEAD>Hallmark Says It Accepted 93 Percent of Univision Bonds Under
Tender Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hallmark Cards Inc. said it had accepted for
payment 93 percent of the $270 million in junk bonds issued by its
Univision Holdings Inc. subsidiary under a tender offer that is
part of a debt restructuring.
   Hallmark said Tuesday it had accepted $161.7 million of
Univision's senior subordinated discount notes due 1998, or 98
percent of the issue outstanding, and $89.9 million of the
company's 13&rsqb; percent subordinated debentures, or 86 percent.
   Under its offer, Hallmark is paying $131 million for the two
series of junk bonds on which its 63.5 percent-owned Univision unit
had missed interest payments. It has agreed to defer interest
payments on the securities it purchases under the tender offer for
five years.
   Hallmark, a privately held greetings card company based in
Kansas City, Mo., last week extended its offer period until Tuesday
after dropping a requirement that at least 90 percent of each issue
be tendered before it would buy the issues.
   Hallmark also announced last week it had reached agreement with
Univision's bank lenders to restructure the subsidiary's bank debt.
   Univision, based in New York, operates an eight-station
Spanish-language TV network that reaches an estimated 92 percent of
Hispanic households in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Despite a last-minute attempt by
opponents to buy more time, the Pennsylvania House on Tuesday sent
Gov. Robert P. Casey a bill that would enact the nation's toughest
curbs against hostile takeovers.
   After a brief debate, the House approved the bill 183-17. The
Senate gave its final backing to the measure Monday.
   Casey has said he would sign the bill. Administration spokesman
John Taylor said the governor has 10 days to act on it.
   Supporters of the measure praised its protections for workers
and said it would help business thrive in Pennsylvania.
   Rep. Marvin E. Miller Jr. said the bill would ``serve as the
fundamental basis for economic development for the future.''
   ``By passing this we're sending a loud and clear message that
people can't make simple, quick chop shops out of our
corporations,'' he said.
   The Republican lawmaker represents the city of Lancaster, whose
leading employer was the target of a takeover attempt that spawned
the bill. The Belzberg family of Canada last year tried to take
over Armstrong World Industries Inc., a floor and tile manufacturer.
   Under the bill, a raider who tried to sell shares within 18
months of a takeover bid would be forced to give up short-term
profits. The bill also would deny raiders voting rights until a
majority of a corporation's stockholders approved.
   Passage came easily despite gloomy warnings the bill would make
Pennsylvania less competitive with other states and would protect
bad managers.
   ``This is bad for labor in Pennsylvania, bad for Pennsylvania
business and bad for the state of Pennsylvania,'' said Rep. Robert
Godshall. ``This would strip any basic and fundamental rights of
stockholders.''
   The bill also would allow management to weigh the interests of
employees, customers or the community, rather than just
shareholders, when considering takeover bids.
   If corporate ownership changes hands, labor contracts would have
to be honored and severance would be paid to laid- off workers. Up
to 90 days after the law takes effect, corporations would be able
to exempt themselves from the legislation.
   Members of the investment community, including the chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, have criticized the bill,
saying it would entrench management and deny shareholders' rights.
With the junk bond market in shambles and takeovers on the wane,
some critics have argued that the legislation is overkill.
   But supporters, including state business and labor interests,
argue it will protect jobs and communities while giving
shareholders long-term stability.
   William Titelman, lawyer for the Belzberg family, predicted the
bill would scare investors from putting money into Pennsylvania
corporations.
   ``I think it's a very sad day, a dangerous day, because we are
now confronted with a bill that has been properly perceived by
investors across the country and even overseas as a piece of
legislation which tells them that Pennsylvania is not a good place
to invest,'' Titelman said.

   The charitable foundations Michael Milken and
his brother endowed with hundreds of millions of dollars will carry
on, and the notoriety of his Wall Street fraud case probably will
generate even more demands for help, their director said.
   Skeptics question the motives for the Milkens' philanthropy,
which became more high-profile after the government revealed its
investigation of him for alleged racketeering and other crimes.
   But friends and beneficiaries of Milken's largesse say his
charity work began long before the probe and was performed with an
intensity mirroring his deal making, particularly when children
were involved.
   ``Some people make snide remarks and say, `He's just trying to
atone,''' said Melba F. Coleman, the principal of 102nd Street
School in Watts. ``I say look at the record. He didn't just start
this when he was indicted.''
   Milken taught math at the elementary school for a day recently,
bringing along pop star Michael Jackson as a treat for the children
in the economically depressed area.
   Milken brought in fruit, vegetables and calculators to
illustrate his lessons and had to be dragged away from the students
at the end of the day, said Mrs. Coleman. He called back to
volunteer again even before she'd written him a thank-you note, she
added.
   ``I tell the kids, `You need to dream big _ you need role
models,''' Mrs. Coleman said. ``I'm sure he made a difference for
them.''
   Jules Lesner, the director of the Foundations of the Milken
Families, said their operations will be unaffected by Milken's
guilty plea Tuesday to six felonies.
   Publicity about those pleas and the $600 million in fines and
restitution Milken agreed to pay will mean ``just an increase in
the number of requests,'' Lesner said. ``More people are aware
we're here and what we do.''
   Milken and his brother Lowell have established four foundations
in all, with endowments that now total nearly $400 million.
Operating out of offices not far from Milken's home in the San
Fernando Valley, they fund educational programs and awards to
educators, health care, cancer and epilepsy research, child care,
museums, job retraining, sports programs.
   A Jewish community center in the West San Fernando Valley was
built with millions of dollars in foundation money. Children at the
Los Angeles Zoo can enter a cave to learn about pallid bats and
ringtail cats and a desert area to study sidewinders and gila
monsters, thanks to a $1 million donation.
   Another $1 million went toward the Museum of Tolerance, the
Jewish Holocaust education facility under construction at the Simon
Wiesenthal Center in West Los Angeles.
   ``His involvement with our charity goes back many years, to at
least 1983,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Wiesenthal Center.
   ``Whenever we asked him to do something, it was always a
personal involvement, never just sending a check.
   ``When Michael Milken would speak to you about charitable
projects, he would make it sound as if you were the most important
person in the world, and you were the only person he was concerned
with at that moment,'' Hier said.
   Even in charity, Milken's activities were questioned. Rep. John
D. Dingell, D-Mich., who heads the House subcommittee on oversight
and investigations, asked the California attorney general's office
to determine if Milken illegally benefited from the foundation's
trades or assets. After a nine-month probe, investigators reported
last August that he had not.
   Richard Riordan, a friend of Milken's who is a lawyer and fellow
philanthropist, said Milken genuinely loves dealing with children,
especially minority children.
   ``His attitude is sort of an underdog _ it's a bit of the Jewish
culture, the underdog culture, the ethic that they have to give to
others. But there's something very special about him. Anything he
does he's hands-on,'' Riordan said.
   Riordan said he expects Milken to continue his charitable work
from behind bars if he goes to prison.
   At the 102nd Street School, Mrs. Coleman said some teachers had
gone out of their way to make sure she heard their criticism of
Milken, accusing him of self-promotion for his visit.
   The children felt differently, she said.
   ``Today, some of them seemed kind of sad,'' she said. ``They
were saying `Will he come back, will he have to go to jail?'''

Carlyle rejecting proposal; picks up 7th graf pvs, `Harsco's

<TEXT>
   Harsco Corp.'s board of directors on
Tuesday rejected a Washington investment group's suggestion that it
sell its defense divisions and borrow $300 million for a special
dividend.
   The 11-member board met privately and late in the day issued a
copy of a letter sent to Frank Carlucci, vice president of The
Carlyle Group, which had called for the steps.
   The letter said the board has considered and rejected such
strategies before, but said Carlucci could meet with Harsco
representatives to discuss the matter further. Carlucci was defense
secretary late in the Reagan administration.
   Calls to Harsco and Carlyle for comment on the letter went
unanswered late in the day.
   Before the director's meeting, Harsco's president and chief
executive told shareholders at the annual meeting that the company
was not considering any offers to sell its defense divisions in
York, Pa., or Marysville, Ohio.
   ``I want to state emphatically that no part of the defense group
has been sold, and that we are not now engaged in discussions to
sell any part of the defense group,'' Malcolm W. Gambill told
shareholders.
   Harsco's defense group also includes BMY-Wheeled Vehicles in
Marysville and Tactical Truck Corp., a joint venture with General
Motors. TTC has won a U.S. government contract to develop new
2.5-ton and 5-ton trucks, which Harsco expects will be produced at
Marysville. Fifteen prototypes are being tested by the Army.
   Gambill said the company feels it has a considerable potential
for international sales of its current military truck produced at
Marysville, and intends to boost daily production to 40 a day. The
company now makes 30 trucks a day.
   Since 1988, Harsco has cut 39.3 percent of the workforce, 1,019
salaried and wage employees, at the York plant. But Gambill told
stockholders the cost cutting and improvements made over an
unprofitable military earth-moving vehicle, known as ACE, will
return the York division to a nominally profitable operation in the
near future.
   Problems with the ACE vehicle cut 1989 earnings from $2.56 a
share to 43 cents a share. The defense group lost $44.4 million in
1988 and $71.9 million in 1989.
   ``We now know what it takes to efficiently build this vehicle,''
said Gambill, adding that Harsco is negotiating with an
international customer for a large order of the vehicles.
   By a 57-10 margin, stockholders rejected a proposal by the New
York State Teachers' Retirement System to withdraw from an
investment in Heckett South Africa Ltd., which it co-owns with
South African Iron and Steel Industrial Corp. Ltd.
   Harsco said in a statement that it feels it was influentual in
eliminating race-based wage and salary discrepancies at HSA and
helping it adopt non-discriminatory policies on housing loans,
educational assistance, job training and company restaurants. The
company said the proposal would result in abandoning black
employees rather than benefiting them.
