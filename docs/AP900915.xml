   Frigates and destroyers from seven NATO
countries have begun exercises in the Mediterranean.
   Ships from Italy, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Britain and
the United States are taking part in the 51-day naval and air
exercises dubbed ``Deterrent Force 2/90,'' which began Friday.
   The maneuvers by the Western military alliance are held twice a
year in the central and western Mediterranean.
   Adm. Jonathan Howe, commander of NATO's southern forces, said
the exercises have a special relevance in the wake of the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   ``Although this period of historic transformation in Europe
offers great hope for our future security, the Iraq invasion of
Kuwait has reminded us again that dangers remain along our
borders,'' he was quoted as saying in a NATO press release.
   ``It is most appropriate that we demonstrate. ... NATO's
continuing vigilance, readiness and unity,'' Howe said.

   The mail pours in from thousands of
Americans, addressed simply to ``Any service member, Operation
Desert Shield.''
   The Marines tend to change the address to ``Any Marine'' as they
read the notes, many of them in care packages of toll house cookies
and other treats.
   ``We are very thankful for your fighting for our country. ...
The least we could do was make you some homemade cookies,'' wrote
two children, 8-year-old Chris Horrigan and his 4-year-old sister
Allysa, from Arvada, Colo.
   The Marines tended to avoid popcorn shipments, which arrived
stale. Cookies were a hit, but nothing brought whoops of joy like
racy books or perfumed envelopes.
   One Marine from the 1st Tank Battalion of the First Marine
Expeditionary Force opened a letter from a woman describing herself
as Single, 26, no kids and female.
   ``I could sell this one,'' he commented.
   Master Gunnery Sgt. Junior Talauega flashes a Bowie knife and
sticks it into a large cardboard box, saying, ``Think of this as a
large Iraqi soldier.'' He draws no blood, but a large batch of
chocolate chip cookies and popcorn.
   The Marines scramble for letters from their home state. Many of
the letters mentioned prayers, reflecting church letter-writing
campaigns for the troops sent to the Saudi desert since Iraq
invaded neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``Every evening after work, I see the news and I pray for your
safety, wrote Vicky Arnold from Middleburg, Fla. ``Please take care
and enjoy the cookies.
   Lt. Thomas Zohlen, 25, of Edgewater, Md., grabbed a bodice
ripper novel and said, ``Let's see if we can find a good page.''
   ``This is pornography, put it away,'' said Sgt. Paul Young, 29,
of Orlando, Fla.
   U.S. troops in the region will be able to mail their letters,
postcards and cassettes free of charge after all.
   The Pentagon said Friday that it agreed with the U.S. Postal
Service to go ahead with the free mail service despite the lack of
action on pending congressional legislation permitting such a move.
   The decision clears up a problem that arose earlier this week
when the postal service said it was ready to go ahead with the
privilege, but the Pentagon said it lacked congressional
authorization.
   The free mail authorization will be funded by the postal service
as an interim measure until legislation allows the appropriated
funds for postage, the Pentagon said in a statement.

<HEAD>Taxes, Spending Cuts Not All Up for Grabs In Budget Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than tax increases and spending cuts are
at stake in the nearly `round-the-clock deficit-reduction
negotiations between congressional and Bush administration
officials.
   As they struggle to avert wholesale cuts in federal programs
next month, the president's aides and top members of Congress also
must decide how to divide targeted tax cuts that would cost more
than $20 billion over the next five years. The intended
beneficiaries include rich investors, giant corporations,
first-time homebuyers and workers pursuing employer-financed
educations.
   Most of a dozen tax benefits that expire this year enjoy wide
support in Congress and are backed by the administration. Thus,
their renewal is likely to be attached to any deficit package
approved by the negotiators. That package likely will be the only
tax bill passed this year.
   The fate of another big proposed tax cut - one that has been the
subject of a running battle between Congress and President Bush
since he took office - is far less certain. The administration
insists on including in the package a cut in the tax on capital
gains. But Democratic leaders are saying that can't be done unless
overall income tax rates on upper-income Americans are raised to
pay for it.
   Senate Republican negotiators on Friday reacted angrily to
implications that their party is trying to favor the rich. ``That
is the old Democrat lie that has been out here for 20, 30, 40
years,'' said GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   His anger was prompted by disclosure of an analysis showing that
a package of tax increases offered by Republicans would lopsidedly
favor higher-income Americans - chiefly because nearly 80 percent
of the benefit of a capital gains reduction would go to those with
incomes over $100,000 a year.
   Negotiators apparently had little success in another day of
closed-door meetings Friday at nearby Andrews Air Force Base in
Maryland. They will try again Sunday, hoping for quick agreement
but promising nothing.
   As far as progress is concerned, griped Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., ``We're nowhere.''
   The goal of the talks is a plan to slash $50 billion from the
budget deficit during the 12 months that begin Oct. 1 plus another
$450 billion in the following four years. Without an agreement, the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will be triggered, forcing $100
billion in cuts in most federal programs.
   But while most of the government is focused on the need to rein
in spending, the budget negotiators have their eyes on renewing
several tax breaks that otherwise would die this year.
   The biggest special benefit likely to be added to the
anti-deficit package is supported by Bush and most members of
Congress. It would cut business taxes by more than $9.2 billion
over the next five years by renewing a credit and deduction rules
aimed at increasing investment in research and experimentation.
   Another $3.7 billion would go to investors who build or
rehabilitate rental housing available for low-income people.
   Among other expiring tax breaks that are likely to be renewed: A
$1.4 billion credit for part of the wages employers pay newly hired
low-income workers; a $1.7 billion exclusion for a limited amount
ot tuition that employers pay for workers; a $546 million exclusion
for employer-financed legal aid for workers; a $770 million subsidy
for lower-income people buying a first home, and a $1.8 billion
credit to help self-employed people pay for health insurance.

   The average Japanese household has more than
$86,000 in savings, up 16.6 percent from a year earlier, according
to a study published today.
   It was the biggest increase in savings since 1973, when the
average rose 28 percent from the year before, according to the
national survey of more than 4,000 families.
   The annual survey was conducted in June and July by the Central
Council for Savings Information, a non-profit group of Japanese
financial institutions and scholars.
   The survey said the average rose to $86,700 because of an
increase in earned income from a strong domestic economy. In
September, Japan entered its 46th straight month of economic
expansion.

   After two weeks of hard training comes
the hardest day.
   ``It's all right, hon. It's going to be fine,'' Sgt. Earnest
Deloach said over and over as his wife, Lillie, sobbed into his big
chest. ``It's okay.''
   The 265th Quartermaster Detachment was leaving for the Mideast.
   Ima Jean Rooker went to hug her son, Spc. Mark Rooker, a big,
strapping boy of 20 whose desert camouflage uniform was hung with
canteens, chemical warfare gear and his M-16.
   Her smile dissolved into tears as she reached out for her
youngest. ``Ooh,'' was all she managed to say.
   Rooker's father, Jerry, stood to the side, reaching in around
his sunglasses to rub his eyes.
   Nineteen days ago, Rooker was a college student, Deloach was a
prison supervisor and the rest of the 14-man unit of the South
Carolina National Guard worked jobs from truck driving to
construction.
   But military planners determined they needed water purification
specialists in Saudi Arabia and the Allendale, S.C., unit showed up
on someone's list.
   The unit was mobilized and rushed through a busy training
schedule of physical conditioning, marksmanship, chemical warfare
and radio communications.
   Now, it was time for goodbyes.
   ``It reminds me of your GI Joe days,'' Mrs. Rooker said to her
son, her voice choking.
   ``I'll be home before you know it,'' Rooker said. There was an
uncomfortable silence.
   Suddenly, Spc. Ulysses Calhoun began to sing. ``Sometimes I feel
like a nut, sometimes I don't ... ''
   Everyone laughed and the tension was broken.
   Calhoun, a 23-year-old construction worker, was usually the one
to complain about the duty or the weather or the food. Today he was
light and breezy, joking with everyone and playing with his
daughter, Whitney, a fearless 3-year-old who marched around with a
U.S. flag in her hand, her father's desert-issue sunglasses propped
on her face.
   ``Daddy, why you always wearing the same clothes,'' she asked,
pointing to his uniform.
   Whitney had seen her father on local television a number of
times, but Calhoun was unimpressed with his celebrity.
   ``I'd rather I was on a game show,'' he said.
   The goodbyes lingered through most of the day. The unit traveled
to Hunter Army Air Field in a tight little convoy of four pickup
trucks and one van. The families followed in their cars, headlights
on like a funeral procession.
   No one talked in the crowded van. ``Why y'all so quiet,'' Sgt.
John Williams asked. ``How about some music?''
   No one noticed the rap music booming out of the radio. Mostly
they napped or stared out the window at signs and yellow ribbons
wishing godspeed to troops already departed for Saudi Arabia.
   The 265th's immediate destination was a large, open airplane
hangar half-filled with cots, a color television, bleachers, video
arcade games, portable latrines and magazines in Eastern Airline
folders. Creedence Clearwater Revival and Pink Floyd echoed from a
loudspeaker in the rafter.
   This was ``lockup,'' a holding area for men and material
shipping out to the Mideast. Once in, the men couldn't leave. Their
families weren't allowed near the area.
   So the families gathered in bleachers set 1,000 yards away to
watch their husbands and sons load duffel bags and flak jackets
onto one of their trucks.
   A while later the families sent over packages of fried chicken
and had their own picnic as the men ate in the sweltering heat of
the runway.
   But finally, it was time for the families to go. They shouted
and waved as the men rushed out to wave back.
   ``Goodbye, goodbye,'' they called, their voices high and thin in
the distance.

<HEAD>Bush: France Has Full U.S. Backing After Assault on Embassy in
Kuwait</HEAD>

   President Bush, declaring that Iraq's entry
into the French and other embassies in Kuwait has heightened
Persian Gulf tensions, is promising French President Francois
Mitterrand full U.S. support for whatever action he may take.
   A French response to the Friday incident was to be discussed
today at an emergency meeting of the French cabinet. The Iraqis
detained four Frenchmen and released one of them, a military
attache, after several hours. The other three had been in hiding at
the embassy to avoid being taken hostage.
   It was a day of heightened tensions in the gulf, brought on not
only by the Iraqi penetration of the French embassy but by similar
actions at the Canadian and Belgian diplomatic missions.
   In addition, a U.S. Navy vessel halted and boarded an Iraqi
tanker in the Gulf of Oman as part of the American effort to
enforce United Nations-ordered sanctions against Iraq. The ship was
released later in the day.
   The State Department expressed concern that the Iraqis might use
their intelligence apparatus to undertake terrorist activities
against American interests in the gulf area.
   Bush denied that all the tough words and the Navy's deeds
constituted saber rattling.
   Meeting with reporters before heading off for a weekend at Camp
David, Md., Bush said, ``When I rattle a saber, the man will know
it,'' he promised. ``When an escalation is required from me, (Iraqi
President) Saddam Hussein will know it.'' He called the incident at
the French Embassy a ``matter of grave concern to the United
States.''
   Bush said the embassy incidents ``add up to clear violations of
international law. They do raise tensions, they clearly do.''
   The American consul and four other consuls were detained by
Iraqi troops at the Canadian Embassy but all were released after
two hours.
   Iraq's official news agency denied Iraqi soldiers stormed the
compounds, which it referred to as ``former diplomatic missions in
the province of Kuwait.'' Since invading and annexing Kuwait in
August, Iraq has referred to the emirate as an Iraqi province. Its
demand for nations to vacate their embassies in Kuwait has been
widely ignored.
   There were these other developments Friday:
   -Bush thanked Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu for his
pledge of an additional $3 billion in financial support for the
U.S. military effort in the Persian Gulf and for compensating
poorer countries affected by the situation there. Bush also praised
Britain for increasing its military contribution to the defense of
Saudi Arabia.
   -Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said
the billions of dollars the United States expects to receive from
its allies for the operation against Iraq must come under
congressional regulations. ``We've got to make sure that we don't
lose the power of the purse,'' Nunn said. But the Democratic
National Committee's executive committee endorsed Bush's policies
in the gulf.
   -Bush asked Congress for an extra $1.9 billion to pay for the
military buildup the Persian Gulf. He also sought congressional
approval to forgive $7 billion in military debts that Egypt owes
the United States as a show of thanks for Egypt's support for U.S.
policy in the gulf.
   -An additional 300 American women and children and non-American
family members who left Kuwait Friday morning were due to arrive in
Baltimore this afternoon. Another flight was scheduled to arrive at
the same location on Sunday.

<HEAD>Desert Deployment Spawns Two Newspapers; Radios for the Troops</HEAD>

   The U.S. military is handing out
radios and more newspapers to GIs hungry for news, but it's not
printing or broadcasting anything the strictly Moslem government
could deem religious or racy.
   In the early weeks of the deployment, troops often asked
visitors to send copies of local newspapers, saying they knew
little about their mission or the situation back home.
   Operation Desert Shield since has spawned two new newspapers,
the Desert Defender and the Desert Dragon, as well as several more
informal newsletters.
   The military this week distributed portable radios by the dozens
at base camps, so the troops can hear Armed Forces radio and local
English-language broadcasts.
   The radios were distributed after the military refined
programming to make sure none of the broadcasts include religious
programming or gospel music.
   ``We are being very sensitive to the culture of the host
country,'' Army Col. Rick Kiernan said. ``We want to get the troops
music, information and sports programming but we also want to be
good guests.''
   A transmitter was recently installed in Saudi Arabia to relay
the radio, and Armed Force television also is available in some
areas where U.S. troops are housed in military housing or hotels.
   Television programming includes sports, news and other shows
transmitted under agreements with the U.S. Cable News Network, ESPN
and the major television networks.
   The Air Force published the first issue of the weekly Desert
Defender last week and issued No. 2 a few days ago.
   Most of the editorial material is written by Air Force public
affairs personnel. Included on the front page of the second issue
was the text of President Bush's Aug. 30 address to the troops.
   Also on the front page is a photograph of the F-117A stealth
fighter, which reporters have been asking to see for several weeks.
   The paper also contains comics and a crossword puzzle.
   The Desert Dragon, a four-page newspaper printed on glossy paper
by a local public relations and advertising firm, will publish its
first issue within days.
   Articles include details of the arrival of several Army units
and the availability of legal advice to the troops.
   Capt. Michael Edrington of the 49th Public Affairs Office
detachment, which publishes the Dragon, said it has a $40,000
budget to print 10,000 issues a week for 12 weeks.
   He said there will be no pictures of women unless they are in
uniform and performing military duties.
   ``Cheesecake isn't done any more,'' said Edrington, who has a
staff of five enlisted men helping him with the paper.
   One of the men, Specialist Michael Hixson of Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., said the first issue almost was delayed because the Arab
printers, reading from right to left as is their custom, typeset
the columns too wide.
   ``It was pretty hokey for awhile but we got it done,'' Hixson
said. ``You got a deadline, you got to meet it.''

   Kuwait, once a showcase of stability and
wealth, has been ravaged beyond recognition by Saddam Hussein's
marauding soldiers and by civilian Iraqi looters, recent escapees
say.
   Some report indiscriminate shootings of Kuwaitis and random
terrorizing of Western residents.
   Kuwait City has become ``a city of ghosts'' following Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion, said Hussein Mohammad, 23, a Palestinian graduate
student, who was interviewed on arrival in Amman, Jordan.
   ``People are afraid to walk the streets at night in order not to
get caught in the middle of clashes between Iraqi troops and
Kuwaiti resistance,'' said Mohammad, who was born in Kuwait.
   ``All that you hear at night is gunfire or explosions during
heavy clashes,'' he said.
   Elizabeth Walters, an evacuee from Kuwait who arrived in Britain
on Wednesday, told of a British man in Kuwait who ``was taken off
into the desert, blindfolded and told to get out of the car.'' Then
Iraqi soldiers threatened to kill him, she said.
   ``He was then pushed back into the car and they drove him round
again and did the same, threatening to kill him again,'' she said.
``They were terrorizing him just for the sheer hell of it.''
   Part of the terror for remaining Westerners is trying to avoid
detection.
   The U.S. State Department said Wednesday that Iraq was
intensifying its efforts to find American men in Kuwait, most
likely to use them as human shields at military targets in Iraq.
   ``In Kuwait, there has been increased harassment of U.S.
citizens, and more systematic house-to-house searches for American
men are now being conducted,'' department spokesman Richard Boucher
said.
   Kuwaitis also live in fear. ``The Iraqis are shooting (Kuwaiti)
people and burning their houses down for writing slanderous
graffiti against them,'' said Deborah Ahmed, a Briton who was
evacuated to London this week.
   Other Western refugees have told of such slayings.
   The plundering was not limited to the military, said Mohammad,
the business student.
   ``I saw Iraqi women looting the Muthana Shopping center on Fhad
al Salem street a few days after the invasion. I saw scores of
Iraqi women carrying away bags full of clothing and shoes, running
out of shops,'' he said.
   ``After Saddam issued an order to hang all looters, the Iraqi
civilians left for home,'' Mohammad said. ``But what is the use of
the order? People had already stolen everything in the city and
there was nothing much left to worry about.''
   But Mohammad said Iraqi authorities have hanged numerous Iraqi
civilians and officials, including an army colonel, for looting.
   ``I saw the hanging of Col. Kathem Khazal, who was accused of
stealing money from the people,'' he said. ``He was hanged on Aug.
25 in front of the town hall in front of hundreds of people. His
body was left hanging for at least four hours so everybody could
see it.''
   Gasoline stations are open and water and electricity are still
available throughout Kuwait City, except at most of the holdout
foreign embassies that refuse to shut down.
   Egyptian diplomats left Kuwait this week because conditions had
become unbearable, an Egyptian official in Cairo said. ``They
couldn't take it any more.''
   A businessman working for a Bahrain-based firm who would only be
identified as B.S., said families put their garbage on the streets
and burn it.
   By many acounts, the most critical problem people face is
obtaining enough food to eat.
   People ``drive round the streets to buy food from anyone
selling,'' B.S. said.
   Mohammad said food prices have risen four times in some cases; a
carton of 30 eggs sells for $8.
   ``Some people even go to Basra or Baghdad just to shop for
food,'' he said. The trip to Iraq includes a stretch across the
desert of more than 310 miles.

   Senate Judiciary Committee members on both
sides of the abortion issue have failed to extract from Supreme
Court nominee David Souter his view of how he would approach the
subject on the nation's highest court.
   But the responses from the New Hampshire judge could make either
side nervous.
   In his second day of testimony Friday, Souter denied he would
join the Supreme Court with any decision already made on
overturning the 1973 abortion rights ruling in Roe vs. Wade.
   ``I have not got any agenda on what should be done with Roe vs.
Wade. I would listen to both sides of that case. I have not made up
my mind,'' he said.
   He later strenuously declined an invitation from Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., to express his view, legalisms aside, on the
morality of abortion.
   Feminist groups, convinced by his remarks that Souter would join
other conservatives on the court in voting to overturn Roe v. Wade,
held a protest Friday calling for his rejection.
   But during the hearing, Souter also gave some pause to the
anti-abortion side.
   Explaining his vote in favor of allowing abortions at a hospital
on whose board he served, Souter spoke of the health risks women
would face if they had no such facility and sought abortions
anyway.
   The discussion sounded much like the rationale of people who
object personally to abortion but still oppose making it illegal.
But Souter said the vote did not necessarily reflect his moral
outlook.
   Souter also lavished praise upon Justice William Brennan, the
liberal pro-choice justice whose retirement created the vacancy
Souter would fill if confirmed.
   Whatever his personal feelings, Souter insisted they ``will play
absolutely no role'' in his decision-making once on the court.
   Just before the hearings broke for the weekend, the questioning
got testy for the first time in the two days as Kennedy pressed
Souter on the nominee's defense of a New Hampshire literacy test
for voters.
   Kennedy read a quote attributed to Souter that the votes of
illiterates ``dilute the votes of those people who can read.'' When
Souter responded, ``That is kind of a statement of math,'' Kennedy
suggested that reasoning was callous.
   ``That's something that I find is troublesome,'' Kennedy said.
   When Kennedy also hammered at Souter's apparent lack of
compassion in the case of two elderly, ailing brothers who failed
in seeking unemployment benefits after being laid off from
part-time work, the nominee pointed to the legislature for passing
the law that created the situation.
   But Souter was far from entirely opposed to the judiciary
stepping in when the legislature didn't act.
   Asked by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, about activist judges
and ``rights created by the courts,'' Souter said he believed ``the
Supreme Court is left to act alone when the political branches do
not act beforehand.''
   Souter said in Brown vs. Board of Education, the 1954 decision
that outlawed racial segregation in public schools, the court acted
``because we had no decision from any other branch of the
government, at any other level of the government, facing the
undoubted constitutional problem that had to be solved.''
   Souter's testimony before the committee resumes Monday. The
committee also will hear from legal experts.
   After the hearings are completed, the Judiciary Committee will
meet to recommend full Senate action. If confirmed, Souter would
become the 105th person to serve on the nation's highest court.

labeling as unrealistic and irresponsible Senate legislation that
would require tougher auto fuel economy standards, saying it would
cause hundreds of additional traffic deaths.
   Skinner denounced the legislation Friday only hours after the
Senate voted 68-28 to consider the proposal next week.
   The measure would require automakers to increase average fuel
economy of new cars to 35 miles per gallon by 1995 and to 40 miles
per gallon by 2001.
   Supporters contend the higher fuel economy requirements, once
fully implemented, would save 2.8 million barrels of oil a day, but
key opponents promised to continue fighting the measure.
   Skinner told a news conference that if the measure clears
Congress, he would strongly advise President Bush to veto it.
   But the measure likely will run into serious opposition in the
House, where supporters must maneuver around the Energy and
Commerce Committee, whose chairman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., is
strongly opposed to the legislation.
   Skinner said the bill is ``unrealistic, irresponsible and, more
important, unattainable.'' He said auto executives have convinced
him there is no technology to achieve the bill's goals without
making cars smaller.
   ``It should be called the highway fatality bill,'' Skinner said.
He cited a new study by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration that concluded there is a clear link between
reducing the size of cars and increasing numbers of traffic deaths.
   Joan Claybrook, NHTSA administrator during the Carter
administration and now president of the consumer group Public
Citizen, disputed claims that cars necessarily will have to be made
smaller to burn less fuel.
   She cited a Transportation Department research vehicle built in
the 1970s that achieved 43 mpg while providing occupants improved
protection over conventional cars.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., who has led the opposition to the
plan, said he would continue the fight against bringing the measure
to a vote next week.
   ``We've just had the first inning of this nine-inning game,''
said Riegle. ``We hope and intend to win this fight.''
   But the Senate vote reflected the growing support in Congress
for an effort to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil, a subject in
the spotlight since Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait early
last month.
   In floor debate, Riegle said the bill's fuel savings wouldn't
likely begin phasing in until 1995 and a better response to today's
oil crisis might be to return to a national speed limit of 55 mph.
   Later, a Riegle spokeswoman said the senator didn't necessarily
support a change in the speed limit and would vote against such a
measure if it were introduced.
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., the bill's sponsor, described the
measure as a message to the automakers ``that they're going to have
to look at fuel economy and not just muscle cars.''

   Feminist Gloria Steinem says a
Michigan law requiring adult consent for minors seeking abortions
will disenchant women.
   ``If a woman is old enough to get pregnant, she's old enough to
get un-pregnant,'' Steinem told a meeting of lawyers Friday.
   The law takes effect in April. It requires a minor to get
permission from a parent or judge before having an abortion.
   ``I fear women are simply losing faith in the law,'' she said.
``When the women's movement started 20 years ago, we had enormous
faith in the system.''
   Steinem is an author, lecturer and co-founder of Ms. magazine.

   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - Former gymnast Mary Lou Retton returned
home to West Virginia for dedication of a state theater in her
name.
   The room in the West Virginia Cultural Center is now ``Mary Lou
Retton Station.'' In thanks at Friday's ceremony, she gave the
center a pair of gym shoes she wore at the 1984 Olympic Games,
where she won a gold medal.
   Retton, 22, lives in Houston and plans to marry in December.
   ``I would love to coach someday,'' Retton said. ``I go to a club
and I still go into the gym and work out once in awhile.''

   RENO, Nev. (AP) - Actor Fred Dryer will not have to forfeit a
$250,000 bond he guaranteed for his former father-in-law, convicted
slot cheat John Vaccaro.
   Government attorneys agreed not to seek forfeiture because of
the time and expense involved, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian
Sullivan said Friday.
   Dryer, former all-pro football player for the Los Angeles Rams
and star of television's ``Hunter,'' put up a California apartment
house he owns as collateral while Vaccaro appealed a conviction on
charges of masterminding a Nevada slot machine cheating ring.
   Dryer was married to Vaccaro's daughter, Tracy, at the time.
   The government had sought to seize the bond since 1987 on
grounds that Vaccaro was indicted in California on racketeering
charges while free for appeal. A U.S. magistrate agreed, but was
told by a federal judge to consider the forfeiture again because
the government's argumentwas shaky.

   Arnold Palmer believes private country clubs
have the right to restrict membership as long as they don't host
public golf tournaments.
   ``I suppose if you have a private country club it's your right
to stay private,'' said Palmer, in Las Vegas on Friday to dedicate
two public golf courses he helped design. ``It's like your own
home. In your home you can do what you wish.''
   ``If you have a golf tournament, you have to let the general
public in,'' he said.
   Palmer said an announcement earlier this week that the Western
Open would be moved from Butler National outside Chicago because of
its all-male membership strips the PGA Tour of one of its finest
courses.
   ``Butler National is a great club and I'm sorry to see that
happen,'' he said. ``But I think there are going to be clubs that
reserve their rights to be private.''

<TEXT>
   Asian refugees heading home from Kuwait are
finding more strife in the desert, even after being moved from a
nightmare camp on the Iraqi border.
   Relief officials closed the squalid Shaalan I border camp on
Thursday and transferred about 5,000 Indians to an organized tent
city near Azraq, 50 miles east of the capital Amman.
   But 14 hours after arriving on a barren, windswept slope, most
of them had gone unfed and on Friday, they appeared worried about
their future.
   ``This morning we are eating only dust,'' said Jose Daniel as
the constant wind blew clouds of ochre-colored powder across the
camp, situated on a field of lava rocks.
   The Red Cross, which built the Azraq I camp, distributed
sandwiches, bread, fruit and vegetables a couple of hours later.
But that did little to relieve the uncertainty and bewilderment
among the refugees.
   ``We thought we were going to Amman. They brought us here in the
night,'' said P.A. Abraham, who was among the Indians bused from
Shaalan I.
   He and others said they had left cooking utensils and some food
behind at the border camp 160 miles away.
   ``They told us we would have everything. We left all our things
behind so as not to carry extra luggage,'' said Achuthan Sreekumar.
   Compared with Shaalan I, a haphazard collection of makeshift
tents that sprang up on the border after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, Azraq I is a model camp.
   Shaalan I's population swelled to as many as 50,000 Indians,
Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans and Filipinos.
   Many were stranded for up to two weeks with little food and
water and no bathroom facilities in a desert where temperatures
soared to 120 degrees during the day and dropped to 60 degrees or
lower at night.
   As relief efforts became better-organized and more aid was
supplied to Jordan's government, those awaiting transportation home
from Jordan were moved to two other border camps and two near
Azraq.
   A high-pressure water line from Amman to Azraq was tapped for
the camp, so water was plentiful. Electricity was to be hooked up
by Friday night, said Werner Kaspar, the head of the International
Committee of the Red Cross delegation in Jordan.
   Kaspar said there were tents for 18,000 people and the camp
could be expanded for up to 30,000.
   What he couldn't provide was information on how long they would
stay. That was up to embassies arranging flights from Amman's
airport.
   Inside the tents, which house up to 20 people each, going home
was almost the sole topic of conversation.

<HEAD>Fourth Countdown Begins for Columbia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fourth countdown for space
shuttle Columbia began early today after NASA checked and rechecked
for hydrogen leaks that halted two earlier launch attempts.
   Columbia was scheduled to lift off with seven astronauts and an
astronomical observatory at 1:28 a.m. EDT. Tuesday.
   The space agency replaced a temperature sensor after a helium
test found a slight leak Thursday, said Bascom Murrah, in charge of
pre-launch operations. The sensor, about the size of a spark plug,
is on a fuel line leading to one of three main engines in the rear
compartment.
   A final check produced no further leaks, Murrah said.
   Earlier in the week, workers replaced a crushed seal on a fuel
valve. Engineers believe hydrogen entered Columbia's rear
compartment around the seal during fueling for the first launch
attempt in May and one last week.
   Murrah said he was more confident than he has been for months.
   Until this week ``we were shotgunning it. We were going at the
thing even if we didn't know it was leaking,'' Murrah said. ``We
have found two definite leaks. To me, that says we've actually
found something and fixed it.''
   The true test will come when more than a half-million gallons of
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen are pumped into Columbia on
Monday. None of the other countdowns have made it past that point.
   Time quickly is running out for the astronomy mission. NASA will
try for a few days to launch Columbia before turning its attention
to Discovery, which must lift off with a sun probe by Oct. 23 or
face a 13-month delay.
   Discovery is the only shuttle in which hydrogen leaks have not
been found. It was the last shuttle to fly, carrying the flawed
Hubble Space Telescope into orbit in April. Atlantis was grounded
in June.
   Columbia's astronauts return to Kennedy Space Center this
weekend for another try at getting off the ground. Four of them are
astronomers who will operate the $150 million observatory, called
Astro.
   Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes and one X-ray telescope
will observe more than 260 high-energy objects, some of them
millions of degrees. Problems with the X-ray telescope forced NASA
to halt Columbia's second countdown late last month.
   The observatory will remain in Columbia's cargo bay throughout
the nine-to 10-day mission.

<HEAD>Scientists: Hormone May Lead to New Hypertension Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say a hormone they found appears to
play a role in development of high blood pressure and could lead to
a new test for hypertension.
   Researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine
and the Upjohn Co. said it is possible drugs could be developed to
block the activity of the hormone, which is still unnamed.
   The scientists said they do not fully understand how the hormone
affects blood pressure or how many cases of hypertension it could
be responsible for.
   The announcement Thursday came on the first day of the American
Heart Association's three-day conference on hypertension.
   High blood pressure affects an estimated 60 million Americans
and is a leading cause of heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and
congestive heart failure.
   The scientists said the hormone appears to be similar to
ouabaine, which was extracted from tropical trees and shrubs by
South American Indians to make poison darts.
   The hormone apparently circulates in everyone's blood system,
the researchers said. Scientists detected the hormone during eight
years of studying dogs, cats, rats, sheep, pigs and cows.
   ``It's kind of surprising that something like a poison can be
present normally in the circulation of every mammalian species we
looked at,'' said Dr. John M. Hamlyn, associate professor of
physiology at the Maryland university.
   Early in the century, physicians prescribed ouabaine to
stimulate sluggish hearts. Later, they switched to digitalis
because it was less toxic.
   The scientists said abnormally high levels of the hormone appear
to impede cells lining the blood vessels from expelling sodium.
This upsets the cells' chemical balance, causing them to retain
abnormally high levels of calcium.
   Elevated calcium causes the vessels to constrict more than they
should, raising blood pressure, said Dr. Mordecai P. Blaustein,
chairman of physiology at Maryland.
   Reasons to measure levels of the ouabaine-like compound in
people's blood include children who have normal blood pressure but
a family history of hypertension. They could be tested for elevated
hormone levels and to see if they risk developing high blood
pressure.
   Such a test also could be used to see whether someone has bona
fide hypertension or ``white coat'' hypertension, which is a
passing elevation in blood pressure caused by anxiety.
   A mistaken diagnosis ``can condemn patients to years and years
of drug therapy,'' Hamlyn said.

   Joe and Joyce Cruzan say they aren't ready to
give up on their lengthy battle in the courts to allow their
daughter to die.
   The Missouri couple, whose 33-year-old daughter Nancy was the
subject of the Supreme Court's first right-to-die ruling, said
Friday they hope to succeed in a new legal effort.
   ``The bottom line is we haven't stopped fighting yet because we
believe in what we're doing,'' said Cruzan, a sheet metal worker
from Carterville, Mo.
   He and his wife on Friday spoke at a law and medical symposium
on the right-to-die issue.
   The couple last month asked a Missouri state court for
permission to remove the tube that carries food and water to their
brain-damaged daughter. They cited new evidence, saying three
people had come forward recently with information about her wishes
concerning life-sustaining medical treatment.
   The Supreme Court, in its first right-to-die decision, ruled
that the Cruzans lacked ``clear and convincing'' proof that their
daughter would want to die. In the 5-4 decision, the justices said
states have broad power to keep patients on life-support systems
when they have not made their wishes known conclusively.
   In their Friday appearance, the Cruzans made their first
extensive public remarks since the ruling last June. They received
a standing ovation from the nearly 500 people in attendance.
   They expressed frustration with the legal system, but said they
were not angered by the Supreme Court's decision.
   ``We were not surprised and it was kind of strange in a way to
hear people say, `Well, it's finally over,' because it wasn't over
for us,'' said Mrs. Cruzan.
   Her husband declined to comment extensively on the pending case,
but said, ``I feel like that the new witnesses, coupled with the
existing testimony, if that's not clear and convincing then I don't
know how you're going to achieve that unless Nancy can raise up
from her bed and write out something and then lay back.''
   No hearing has been held on their latest request.
   Nancy Cruzan has been in a coma-like condition, called a
persistent vegetative state, since a 1983 automobile accident.
There are an estimated 10,000 Americans receiving similar
life-sustaining care.

<HEAD>Study Finds No Link Between Cancers, Nuclear Facilities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People living in or near counties with nuclear
facilities face no increased risk of death from cancer, results of
a government study show.
   But the survey methods used in the two-year investigation, the
results of which were released Friday by the Department of Health
and Human Services said Friday, did not permit an assessment of
risks in more limited areas around a facility, the head researcher
cautions. Groups concerned about the health and environmental
effects of nuclear power pointed to that flaw in the study.
   HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan called the National Cancer
Institute survey ``an important step in evaluating the possible
hazards of living near nuclear facilities.'' He said other studies
at the state and federal level are in progress.
   NCI's mortality survey involved 107 counties across the nation
containing or close to 62 nuclear facilities.
   Among the facilities were 52 commercial plants, nine Energy
Department research and weapons plants and one commercial
fuel-reprocessing plant, all of which began operating before 1982.
   HHS said in a statement that cancer institute researchers
examined deaths from 16 types of cancer, including leukemia. Cancer
death rates in the 107 counties with or near nuclear facilities
were compared to cancer rates in a control group of 292 similar
counties with no nuclear facilities nearby.
   The agency said some of the 107 counties had higher rates of
certain cancers than the control counties and some had lower rates,
either before or after the facilities came on line.
   ``There was no convincing evidence of any increased risk of
death from any of the cancers we surveyed due to living near
nuclear facilities,'' said John Boice, chief of NCI's Radiation
Epidemiology Branch.
   However, Boice said the counties may be too large to detect
risks present in limited areas around nuclear installations. ``No
study can prove the absence of an effect,'' he said, adding that
any risk would be too small for detection with the researchers'
methods.
   Starting in 1987, the NCI scientists surveyed more than 900,000
cancer deaths using county mortality records collected from 1950 to
1984. They evaluated changes in mortality rates for 16 types of
cancer from 1950 to the date the facility started operation, and
from the start of operation until 1984. More than 1.8 million
cancer deaths were studied in the 292 control counties.
   Michael Mariotte, director of the Nuclear Information and
Research Service, said his national network of 1,000 environmental
groups considers the NCI research incomplete and misleading.
   ``Their methodology was not designed to find anything,''
Mariotte said.
   Mariotte said cancer has a long latency period and victims don't
die from it instantly. ``Most of these plants haven't been up long
enough for people who have developed cancers to die from them,'' he
said. ``You have to look at the incidence of cancer rather than the
mortality.''
   The other main problem, he said, is that the county-wide data
does not specifically address the population most at risk - people
living downwind of the plants. ``These are the people where you
would expect the maximum exposures,'' he said. ``You really have to
look at meteorological data.''
   The NCI survey was sparked by public concerns in the United
States and a British survey that found elevated rates of childhood
leukemia deaths near some British nuclear installations.

<TEXT>
   City election officials are under a federal
judge's order to conduct a special hearing on whether presidential
assailant John W. Hinckley Jr. should be allowed to vote this fall.
   U.S. District Judge June Green issued the order Friday after
Hinckley sought court permission to attend an administrative
hearing that had been scheduled.
   Hinckley, found innocent by reason of insanity for the 1981
shooting of President Ronald Reagan, has been confined to a mental
hospital since 1982.
   He must obtain court permission to leave the St. Elizabeths
Hospital complex and prosecutors have vehemently opposed his
requests over the years. He claims he has been unfairly denied a
right to vote in the District of Columbia. He claims he is entitled
to do so because he has been a D.C. resident and a taxpayer for the
last eight years.
   Green ordered election officials to hold the hearing on
Hinckley's voting rights claim at the hospital.
   Hinckley is legally entitled to a public hearing, but St.
Elizabeths officials said they could not allow reporters or other
members of the public to attend.
   Because of that, Green ordered that a transcript of the hearing
be made public.

<HEAD>Survey Finds `Appalling Gap' in Public's View of Free-Speech
Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans believe their views should be
protected under the First Amendment, but that constitutional
protection should not necessarily be applied to others, says a
group that conducted a private survey on free speech.
   Americans surveyed overwhelmingly believe the Constitution
guarantees their individual freedom of expression but more than
one-fourth say that protection shouldn't apply to the arts or the
media, according to the survey released Friday by the Thomas
Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression.
   The nationwide telephone survey of 1,500 adults in June also
showed that while nearly three-fourths defended an artist's right
to display works that might be offensive, fewer than 25 percent
favored supporting those works with tax funds.
   Robert O'Neil, founding director of the center, said the survey
spotlighted ``an appalling gap'' in public understanding of free
speech and equally protected freedom of the press.
   ``We found alarming evidence of a double standard, a sense that
the First Amendment protects what the speaker wants to say, but not
so clearly the views of others,'' O'Neil said, releasing the survey
results at a news conference on the steps of the Jefferson
Memorial.
   While 90 percent of Americans believe the government has no
business telling them what to say, nearly 59 percent said the
government should have some power of censorship, according to the
center's survey.
   In addition, more than half said the government has the right to
ban the sale of recordings that favor drug use or broadcasting of
sexually explicit lyrics; 84 percent favored mandatory labeling of
recorded songs containing such lyrics.
   The survey said between 25 percent and 30 percent of those
questioned believed the First Amendment's guarantees of free speech
didn't cover art works, films, music, radio, cable and network
television, play, newspapers or photographs.
   On federal support for controversial art, an issue that has
plagued the National Endowment for the Arts for months, the survey
showed that nearly 74 percent of Americans backed artists' rights
to display works that might be offensive.
   But 72 percent opposed spending tax money for ``objectionable''
art, films or plays, the survey said.
   O'Neil urged Congress not to impose any new anti-obscenity
restrictions on the NEA, the same position taken earlier this week
by a bipartisan study commission created by Congress.
   ``It is one thing for government simply not to be a patron of
the arts,'' said O'Neil, a legal scholar and former president of
the University of Virginia. ``It is quite another for government to
say it will support only individual works or artists it does not
deem objectionable.''
   The center is a non-profit, non-partisan, privately financed
institute associated with the University of Virginia that defends
First Amendment rights of free expression.
   Its trustees include syndicated columnist James J. Kilpatrick
Jr., film producer Richard Roth, American Civil Liberties Union
president Norman Dorsen, and political consultant Mary Dent Crisp,
former co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.

   The ``Massachusetts mutiny'' ended quietly when
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis returned from Europe and his lieutenant
governor returned to second in command.
   Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy dropped out of the Democratic primary for
governor after attempting last week to take control of the state's
sagging finances by ordering cuts in spending.
   Critics contended Murphy's mutinous behavior while Dukakis was
on a European trade mission was aimed at boosting her founderng
campaign. Dukakis ended her brief reign as acting governor Friday
when he returned.
   Dukakis, who is not seeking re-election, planned to meet today
with aides to discuss the state budget, which is running a deficit
just two months into the fiscal year.
   Some elements of Murphy's plans to cut spending might be
adopted, said S. Stephen Rosenfeld, Dukakis' chief of staff.
   ``I will take advice from anybody and everybody who can
constructively participate in this - that includes the lieutenant
governor,'' Dukakis told reporters.
   Murphy said her plans would save the state about $150 million
annually. She called for slashing about 1,000 state jobs.

<HEAD>Administration Considering $18 Billion Arms Sale To Saudis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration is preparing to submit to
Congress a request to sell Saudi Arabia $18 billion worth of
weapons, including F-15 fighter planes, tanks and other
sophisticated arms, an official says.
   Officials at the State and Defense departments were working with
Saudi officials to determine that country's needs to withstand the
military threat posed by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   ``It's not all finalized yet, and it won't be until we submit it
to Congress,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   If it goes through, it is believed the sale would be the largest
single arms deal in U.S. history.
   The administration has already proposed selling Saudi Arabia $3
billion in new weapons to bolster its defenses, including F-15
fighter planes, M-60 tanks, 15,000 rounds of armor-piercing
anti-tank ammunition and 200 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles,
according to congressional sources.
   The larger package includes 24 additional F-15s, as many as 48
Apache helicopters, 385 M-1A2 tanks, 400-500 M-2 Bradley armed
personnel carriers and thousands of trucks and jeeps, the New York
Times said in today's editions.
   The Washington Post, in its editions today, said the package
would range from $18 billion to $23 billion and also would include
Patriot air defense systems, naval command and control systems and
thousands of tons of ammunition.
   Earlier in the day, an administration official noted that
additional sales had been promised to Saudi Arabia when the latest
package was recently announced. However, the official said, ``No
recommendations have come to the White House.''
   Once the larger package is submitted to Congress, lawmakers will
have two months during which they can debate it and decide whether
to approve the sale.
   The White House had approved the sale in principle and passed
the plans along to technical teams to work on the details, the
official said.
   The administration is trying to speed up submitting the package
in order to take advantage of the bipartisan support for President
Bush's policy on Saudi Arabia and his decision to send more than
100,000 troops to defend the oil-rich kingdom, said another
official familiar with the deal.

   A book about Israel's secret service that Israel
tried to suppress has sold out all over town and orders to the
publisher have more than doubled.
   Bookstores were swamped Friday with requests for copies of ``By
Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a Mossad Officer.''
   Thursday, a state appeals court approved distribution of the
book, reversing a judge's decision to ban sale of the book at the
request of the Israeli government.
   St. Martin's Press, the publisher, originally received orders
for 50,000 copies. This week orders jumped to more than 100,000.
   ``It is a recurring phenomenon that if someone wants to stop
publication of a book, just the opposite occurs. Many people will
read it who wouldn't otherwise,'' said Roy Gainsburg, president of
St. Martin's Press.
   Israel claims the book could endanger its intelligence agents by
blowing their covers.
   The author, Victor Ostrovsky, says he was a Mossad agent for
four years in the 1980s. He wrote in the book that Israel had
detailed information about preparations for the bombing that killed
241 U.S. Marines in Lebanon in 1983 but gave the United States only
a vague warning so that U.S.-Arab relations would be damaged.
   A sampling of city bookstores Friday found most still waiting
for their copies of the book, but managers said readers were asking
for it already.
   ``Every other call last night was a request for the book,'' said
Jill Tardiff, general manager of a Doubleday bookstore on Fifth
Avenue. The store has increased its order to over 500 copies, she
added.
   Four shops in the Waldenbooks chain said they had received
shipments of the book and almost immediately sold out.
   About 30 copies of the book arrived at a Waldenbooks store in
the financial district Thursday afternoon after the appeals court
lifted the ban, said Roman Schreiner, the store's manager.
   ``We sold out this morning, shortly after opening,'' he said
Friday.
   St. Martin's had already shipped some 17,000 copies of the book
to 1,500 stores and reviewers before Israel obtained the temporary
order to ban sales.
   Gainsburg said 30,000 copies of the book that could not be sent
Thursday because of the ban were shipped Friday.

   American and Australian warships
fired warning shots and then boarded an Iraqi oil tanker in the
Gulf of Oman, U.S. Navy officials said.
   Friday's interception was the third reported shooting incident
since the U.N.-backed sea blockade of Iraq began five weeks ago,
and the first involving any other than a U.S. member of the
multinational force enforcing the sanctions.
   The tanker, identified as the 41,400-ton Al-Fao, at first
ignored .50-caliber machine gunshots by the U.S. frigate Brewton,
but stopped after a second volley by the Australian missile frigate
Darwin, they said.
   Cmdr. Dave Knox, a U.S. spokesman, said the two frigates, on
blockade duty in the waters just outside the Strait of Hormuz, the
entrance to the Persian Gulf, intercepted the tanker and were
advised that it was an Iraqi ship, sailing empty and bound for the
Iraqi port of Basra.
   He said the Brewton, a 4,200-ton frigate, requested the tanker
to stop and allow a boarding party to inspect it. ``After repeated
requests, the Brewton fired warning shots with its .50-caliber
machine gun,'' he said.
   When the tanker refused to stop, the Darwin fired more warning
shots with a .50-caliber machine gun. ``The master of the Al-Fao
then advised that he was stopping the ship and would permit
boarding,'' Knox said.
   He said a combined naval-coast guard team from the Brewton and
another team from the Darwin boarded the tanker. ``They discovered
no prohibited cargo and the Al-Fao was allowed to proceed.'' he
said.
   Two American missile frigates fired warning shots at two Iraqi
tankers in and near the Persian Gulf on Aug. 18 but did not attempt
to stop or board the vessels.
   Since then the U.N. Security Council has approved the use of
``minimal force'' by members of the multinational force in the gulf
region to prevent ships from carrying cargo to and from Iraq.
   The embargo aims to force Iraq's withdrawal from oil-rich
Kuwait, which was invaded Aug. 2.
   U.S. warships have challenged 900 commercial ships and boarded
23 before Friday's incident, according to U.S. military officials
here.
   Al-Fao is one of several Iraqi tankers that have tried to run
the U.N.-sponsored blockade but was turned away last month from the
Saudi Arabian port of Yanbu, on the Red Sea.
   The Brewton is a member of the U.S. battle group led by the
aircraft carrier Independence in the north Arabian Sea.
   The Darwin and a sister ship, the Adelaide, arrived in the
region Aug. 30 to join the multinational force.

Gulf crisis:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Western nations sharply protested Iraq's raids Friday on the
French, Belgian and Canadian diplomatic compounds in occupied
Kuwait. Since its Aug 2. invasion, Iraq has ordered all embassies
in Kuwait to close.
   French President Francois Mitterrand called an emergency Cabinet
meeting for today. France said Iraqi troops removed four people,
including a diplomat, from the French ambassador's residence and
took them to an unknown destination.
   Iraq denied its soldiers entered the compounds.
   ---
   U.S. and Australian Navy ships fired warning shots and halted an
Iraqi tanker in the Gulf of Oman on Friday as part of the effort to
enforce trading sanctions against Iraq. After a boarding party
identified the cargo, the tanker Al-Fa was allowed to proceed to
its destination.
   ---
   More than 360 evacuees, mostly American women and children,
arrived in London late Friday on a flight from Iraq. The Americans
were due to leave for Baltimore this afternoon.
   An estimated 2,200 Americans remain captive in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ---
   Military pressure on Iraq intensified. Britain said it will send
an armored brigade of more than 120 tanks and 6,000 combat troops
to the Persian Gulf, and Canada committed a dozen fighter jets, 450
fliers and ground crew. Italy, Belgium and South Korea pledged
either money or equipment.
   ---
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was scheduled to travel to
West Germany today. He's urging NATO allies to send troops to
symbolize shared involvement with the military buildup.
   President Bush asked Congress on Friday for $1.9 billion more
toward Operation Desert Shield, which officials say is costing
Washington an estimated $1 billion a month.
   The administration also is preparing to ask Congress to approve
the sale to Saudi Arabia of $18 billion worth of F-15 fighter jets,
tanks and other sophisticated arms, a U.S. official source said.

   Iraq announced plans to ration bread beginning today. Rationing
of sugar, rice, cooking oil, soap and detergent began in some
neighborhoods earlier this month.

   Lines were long and dreams were big for
tonight's $100 million Lotto drawing.
   It was possible, but not probable, that the jackpot will end up
at more than $115 million, the amount of the nation's highest,
Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said Friday.
   The chance of a single winner was nearly one in 14 million,
which is the number of possible combinations of six numbers. It was
likelier the riches will be split among several winners.
   With 100 million tickets expected to be sold by tonight's
drawing, there was only one chance in 200 that no one will pick all
the winning numbers, lottery spokesman Ed George said.
   And they could come from anywhere.
   ``Everybody who knew I was coming to Florida this week wanted me
to buy them Lotto tickets,'' said Frank Greer, a Washington
campaign consultant for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Lawton
Chiles. ``That's all anyone is talking about.''
   The state Lottery Department fielded calls from across the
country and Canada, George said.
   The $1 Lotto tickets were hustled for $3 to $5 at newsstands on
Wall Street and midtown Manhattan. A dry cleaning shop in
Washington, D.C., was shut down Friday for illegal sales.
Authorities said more than $1,000 in cash was seized along with a
lottery machine and gaming receipts.
   In Georgia, a couple who parked their pickup truck at a Macon
shopping mall and posted a sign saying ``Florida lottery tickets
for sale'' was arrested Wednesday on commercial gambling charges.
   Michael LaBruno, a self-proclaimed ``Lotto nut'' from Jersey
City, N.J., flew to Jacksonville and bought $7,600 in tickets at a
convenience store. It took almost five hours to process the tickets
and cost him $600 in air fare.
   Connecticut businesses that deliver tickets for out-of-state
lotteries were swamped with customers, most interested in the
Florida drawing.
   Thomas Wilkison, owner of the Manchester Lotto Express office,
said his office took orders for 20,000 tickets Wednesday. By
mid-afternoon Thursday, 17,000 more had been taken.
   Florida's previous record Lotto prize was $58 million, split
between five winners in April. Each winning ticket was worth almost
$11.7 million to be paid over 20 years.
   The record for a prize to a single winner of a computerized
numbers game is held by Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs, who won a
$55.1 million Florida Lotto jackpot in September 1988.
   The current jackpot was missed four weeks in a row, rolling over
each time. Pennsylvania's lottery produced the nation's highest
jackpot in April 1989. It paid the holders of 14 winning tickets
$8.3 million over 26 years.
   Throughout the week in Florida, there were several reports of
Lotto players spending $10,000 on the weekly computerized game. But
not all were big spenders.
   A mother of three in Apopka bought a Lotto ticket with 100
pennies.
   ``It was all we had,'' said Melanie Faby, 37. ``If we win, I'll
start a foundation to help abused children and women.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. evacuees say Iraqi troops are
wiping out the Kuwaiti resistance fighters, and an animal rights
official accused the Iraqi forces of eating most of the animals in
Kuwait's zoo.
   More than 270 Americans were to leave today for Baltimore after
arriving at Gatwick airport outside London along with other
nationalities aboard an Iraqi jet the night before, the U.S.
Embassy said.
   Galina Suliman from San Francisco, who arrived on the Iraqi
Airways Boeing 747 from Baghdad, said: ``The Kuwaiti resistance has
been put down ruthlessly by the Iraqis in the past day or two.''
   Her husband, Rani, said he saw the bodies of seven Kuwaitis
hanged by the Iraqis for looting. ``One was hanging from a crane.
They left him there for four days,'' he said.
   Andrea Hanson from Portland, Ore., who arrived on the same
U.S.-chartered flight into Gatwick, said Kuwaiti groups did not
have enough weapons to fight the Iraqis.
   The Times of London today quoted Victor Watkins, an official of
the World Society for the Protection of Animals, as saying Iraqi
soldiers in Kuwait have eaten 70 percent of the edible animals in
Kuwait's zoo.
   The zoo's staff fled after the invasion, and the animal
protection group fears that all the animals in the zoo may have
been wiped out, including rare species such as the soemmerings
gazelle and the shoebill stalk. The newspaper article did not
specify how Watkins got his information or how many animals were in
the zoo.
   Watkins, the society's director for the Middle East, said the
soldiers have eaten many antelope and deer. ``It is a dreadful
situation. Things are desperate enought for the people, so anyone
might understand how bad it is for the animals.''
   On Friday's flight to Gatwick, there were believed to be 275
Americans plus 43 Canadians, 26 Britons, six Japanese, six
Australians, two West Germans and a number of Indians, Syrians and
Filipinos, the British domestic news agency Press Association.
   Most were women and children but there was confusion about
precise numbers. An official at the U.S. Embassy said today he did
not know the exact number of Americans.
   The plane left Baghdad Friday afternoon and landed at Gatwick 25
miles south of London shortly before midnight. The Americans and
others spent the night in hotels.
   A Gatwick airport official said 30 people due to fly on the
plane were detained in Baghdad because they could not clear Iraqi
exit formalities in time. She did not give the nationalities of the
30.
   Sky News television said the women and children on Friday's
plane are believed to have been among the last who expressed a wish
to leave behind their husbands and fathers in Kuwait.
   Ms. Hanson, who traveled with her son Zach, 5, said people in
Kuwait had to wait in line five hours for some food items.
   She added: ``I saw with my own eyes a lot of looting and burning
but I cannot say it was all by Iraqis.''
   Speaking of Kuwaiti resistance fighters, she said: ``Resistance
is very haphazard ... They haven't got enough people. They haven't
got enough weapons.''
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and later annexed the oil-rich
emirate.

<HEAD>Auto Strike Called in Canada Against Ford</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian Auto Workers union today began a
strike against Ford Motor Co. of Canada after negotiators decided
they could not meet a midnight deadline for settling the dispute
over pay, benefits and job security.
   Parallel talks in the United States recessed early today, with
the United Auto Workers telling its members not to strike against
General Motors Corp. The negotiators in Detroit agreed to extend a
similar deadline and more talks were set for later today.
   The Canadian talks were also to continue later today, spokesmen
for Ford and the Canadian union said.
   ``We still have a very significant distance between the two
positions,'' Don MacKenzie, Ford's chief negotiator, told reporters
as discussions broke off Friday at a downtown Toronto hotel.
   The union president, Robert White, said the strike - the first
against Ford of Canada since 1976 - would begin midnight Friday.
   Up to 12,800 workers are expected to walk off the job at nine
plants and two offices in Ontario. The company has two plants in
Oakville, five in Windsor, one in St. Thomas and one in Niagara
Falls.
   However, the strike won't mean anything in terms of production
until Monday because Canadian Ford plants do not operate weekends.
   After announcing the strike late Friday, White said the tough
issues were job security, protection from inflation and time off.
``Ford is balking at putting enough economics on the table to get
an agreement,'' he said.
   Both sides have refused to disclose details of their proposals
and demands. It was not known how much of a raise the union was
demanding over the current hourly base pay of about $15 (US).
   Earlier Friday, union and company officials had agreed
communication was good and that work was progressing toward a new
contract. But White had acknowledged it was impossible to get
everything done by the midnight deadline.
   In Detroit, the United Auto Workers union and General Motors
Corp. agreed to extend their national labor contract Friday, local
union leaders said.
   ``They're going to negotiate through the weekend,'' said Charlie
Gledhill, acting president of UAW 549 at GM's metal stamping plant
in Mansfield, Ohio. In both countries, the unions target a single
company in their talks in hopes of fashioning a pattern contract
for workers at other automakers.
   White said earlier in the day that Ford had not made a new
economic proposal since the first one put on the table a few days
ago, which the union found unacceptable. He said the union had
presented Ford with a counterproposal early Friday and that Ford
officials went off to calculate the numbers.
   Ford Canada spokesman Jim Hartford confirmed that, but said he
did not know how long it would take Ford to work out the cost of
the union proposal.
   Neither side offered details of the proposals.

   Irene Lee Wait simply wanted to
replace the ronze plaque that branded her pioneer
great-grandfather the mastermind of the most shameful episode in
Mormon history.
   ``I was so unhappy about it. It wasn't true,'' said the
75-year-old descendant of John D. Lee, the only man ever charged in
the infamous Mountain Meadows Massacre.
   From her vexation has come not only a new marker, but a new
memorial - a stone arch etched with the names of Arkansas migrants
who were slaughtered by Mormon militiamen and Paiute Indians 133
years ago.
   Kindled too was a spirit of reconciliation among the victims'
descendants and those of the Mormon pioneers who, as one historian
said, were ``frenzied by mistaken zeal'' to protect their homes,
families and church.
   ``I hope that what it will do is change the focus from what
happened in the past to what can happen in the future,'' said Rex
Lee, president of Mormon Church-owned Brigham Young University and
John D. Lee's great-grandson.
   On Friday, about 60 of Lee's descendants - he had 19 wives -
gathered at the old monument in southwestern Utah to replace the
marker on a monument erected in 1932. The new memorial will be
dedicated Saturday in Cedar City.
   ``Those who have gone to the other side - you can feel their
presence - they have made their peace and so have we,'' Wait said
in a benediction.
   The massacre on Sept. 11, 1857, occurred after President James
Buchanan concluded that the fiercely independent Mormons, who had
fled persecution in Ohio, Missouri and Illinois, were in rebellion.
When he ordered an army to the Utah Territory, war fever ensued.
   Into the storm rode a California-bound company of Arkansas
settlers led by Alexander Fancher and John T. Baker, along with a
band of horsemen from Missouri who baited the unfriendly Mormons as
they wended southward from Salt Lake City.
   In her definitive history, ``The Mountain Meadows Massacre,''
Juanita Brooks said Lee was not present when local Mormon militia
leaders decided the Fancher train, camped in the meadows 35 miles
southwest of Cedar City, must be ``done away with,'' with the
Paiutes' help.
   They sent a runner to Mormon leader Brigham Young in Salt Lake
City, but his orders to leave the settlers alone apparently arrived
too late.
   Lee was present, however, at the massacre, which began with a
trick.
   Lee and another man convinced the emigrants they would help them
reach safety from Indian attack. Mormon militiamen then escorted
the unarmed settlers single file from the safety of their wagons.
   On a signal, the militiamen shot the men and the Indians sprang
from the brush to kill the women and older children.
   Of some 120 people, 17 young children survived and eventually
were turned over to federal agents. Their cattle and supplies were
sold and the Indians blamed for the slaughter.
   Over the years, whispers about the massacre grew to persistent
demands for justice. Lee, his great-granddaughter says, became the
scapegoat for his church. Excommunicated in 1870, he later was
convicted and condemned to die.
   Lee was brought to Mountain Meadows in 1877 where, seated on the
edge of his coffin, he denounced Young for abandoning him. Then he
was executed by a firing squad.
   ``The fate of the emigrant train was decided by military
leaders,'' Wait said. ``He didn't confess to anything. He gave his
life to save the church.''
   The old plaque named Lee as the confessed militia leader and
misrepresented the number of dead. The new marker gives a
straightforward account and casts no blame.
   Wait hopes the marker and memorial will ease the pain of the
Fancher train descendants, one of whom she met at the old monument.
   ``One lady came up to me very angry, and said, `I want to know
what happened to the stock and the money from the train,''' Wait
recalled.
   ``I stopped and thought for a moment. I said, `I can understand
why you're hostile. I would be, too, if my ancestors were
killed.'''
   ``Her whole attitude changed,'' Wait said. ``And she said, `I'd
be angry, too, because your ancestor was killed for something he
didn't do.'
   ``We were friends then.''

   The New York Post screamed the good news.
``AIN'T OVER YET'' read the front page in what could have been the
final edition of the nation's oldest continuously published daily.
   The Post got a temporary reprieve Friday night when all but one
union agreed to $19 million in concessions after more than 12 hours
of negotiations.
   The ultimate fate of the 189-year-old newspaper depends on a
vote Monday by members of The Newspaper Guild. Its negotiating
committee voted 7-3 against the settlement agreed to by bargainers
for 10 other unions.
   ``If the choice is death or three days to live, I'll take three
days,'' said Jerry Nachman, the newspaper's editor.
   Publisher Peter Kalikow is demanding massive concessions to make
the tabloid break even. The newspaper is losing about $27 million a
year.
   The more than 850 Post workers represented by the 10 unions must
ratify the the agreement. The Guild represents 352 reporters and
members of the advertising staff.
   A cheer went up in the newsroom when Kalikow announced in a
televised news conference that the newspaper had at least another
three days.
   Eric Breindel, editorial page editor, said Kalikow had written
two columns for today's newspaper: one celebrating its survival,
one lamenting its demise. On Friday, some Post reporters worked on
``Live Post'' issues while others worked on ``Dead Post'' issues.
   ``We've been through a wringer all day long for a few days and
we're going to have to go through it again,'' said metropolitan
editor John Cotter.
   Cotter said a prepared farewell edition that included
reminiscences from past Post columnists was ``terrific ... but
hopefully it'll never be read by the public.''
   Money troubles are not new to the Post, founded in 1801 by
Alexander Hamilton.
   In 1939, heiress Dorothy Schiff bought the Post and made it one
of the nation's most liberal newspapers. But the Post also became
known for making do with a small staff and old equipment.
   In 1976, Schiff sold the newspaper to Australian media baron
Rupert Murdoch for $31 million. At the time, the newspaper was
losing $500,000 annually.
   Under Murdoch, the Post went conservative editorially and began
running sexy pictures, racy headlines - including the famous
``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' - and a steady diet of crime
stories.
   Murdoch said the newspaper lost $150 million before he sold it
in 1988 for $37 million to Kalikow, a real estate developer who
also acquired the newspaper's valuable waterfront land in Lower
Manhattan.
   The Post said today that Kalikow is demanding that the drivers
union give up 100 of 263 jobs; the 70 printers cut their work week
to four days and the 17 paper handlers give up five jobs.
   The Guild was asked to give up 43 jobs and to agree to a
four-day work week for four days' pay.
   ``I feel optimistic that when the members see it they will
approve it,'' said Kalikow. ``If they turn it down, the paper will
stop publishing immediately.''
   The Daily News, which also is losing money and is in the midst
of a labor conflict, has demanded that any concessions the unions
give the Post must be extended to the News under ``me-too''
contract clauses.
   The New York Times said it would seek union concessions related
to the same economic conditions that have affected the Post and
News and led to declines in ad revenues.

<HEAD>Troops Advance Towards Jaffna Hospital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops today advanced
slowly through booby-trapped buildings and mined streets toward the
main hospital in the northern city of Jaffna, military officials
said.
   Capturing the hospital offers the government both strategic and
psychological advantages in trying to loosen the Tamil rebels' grip
on the town.
   The abandoned hospital is in the center of Jaffna, about a mile
from Jaffna Fort, which the army said it reached Thursday, breaking
a three-month siege by Tamil separatist rebels.
   The government says 25 soldiers have been killed and at least
136 wounded since Thursday. It claims more than 100 Tamil Tigers
have died.
   The Tigers' office in London has denied the siege was broken.
   The military officials did not say how far their men had
advanced today, but a senior officer said they were under constant
rebel fire and progress was very slow because of mines buried in
the streets and booby traps hidden in buildings along the way.
   The overwhelmingly Tamil town 185 miles northeast of Colombo,
the capital, has been a Tiger stronghold since the rebels embarked
on their separatist war against Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority in
1983.
   But this summer's new outbreak of civil war, coupled with the
Tigers' strong-arm tactics of soliciting funds, is sapping
enthusiasm for the guerrilla cause in the city of 60,000, recent
visitors to the town reported.
   The Tigers also claimed their first successful attempt to down a
government plane with a SAM-7 missile.
   The government conceded that a single-engine ground-attack plane
crashed in Jaffna Lagoon on Thursday. But it said the pilot ditched
the Italian-made Marchetti aircraft when he could not pull out of a
dive after attacking a Tiger gun position. The pilot was reported
missing.
   The military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
accused the Tigers of killing eight unarmed Moslem civilians in
eastern Sri Lanka Thursday night and Friday.
   Four Tiger guerrillas were killed in clashes with government
troops in the region, the officials said.
   The Tigers have been fighting for political autonomy or
independence for the Tamil minority, claiming to have been
victimized by Sinhalese discrimination in jobs, education and use
of the Sinhala language.
   The Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's population
of 16 million, control the government and the military.
   Tamils, who account for 18 percent of the people, live mostly in
the north and east of the Indian Ocean island. Moslems make up 7
percent of the total population; most of them live in the east.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed since the war erupted in
1983 in this once-idyllic nation of palm-fringed beaches, precious
gems and tropical plantations.

<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators took ``body samples''
from a suspect in the slayings of five college students and
considered searching an area frequented by another suspect in the
case.
   Searchers waded through alligator-infested swamps and scoured
dense woods Friday looking for body parts and other evidence near
three complexes where the bodies were found nearly three weeks ago.
   Authorities said they conducted the search because Edward Lewis
Humphrey, 18, frequented wooded areas. Rusty knives, metal, paper
products and clothing were among items found in the search.
   Police Lt. Sadie Darnell said the objects must be analyzed to
determine if they are connected with the slaying of four women and
one man. Two of the women were mutilated and another was
decapitated.
   Polk County authorities, meanwhile, announced that the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement had taken ``body samples'' from
Stephen Bates, 30, a burglary suspect jailed in Bartow since Aug.
29.
   Investigators already have taken blood and hair samples from
Humphrey at the Brevard County Jail, where he has been held in the
Aug. 30 beating of his grandmother.
   Humphrey also faces warrants in an Aug. 25 assault on two male
University of Florida students and an October 1988 armed burglary
and attempted rape in Indian River County.
   Bates and Humphrey are the two suspects publicly identified by
police. Six other people also are considered suspects.
   Darnell said authorities may search Sebastian Inlet State Park.
The area, searched shortly after Humphrey's arrest. Humphrey, a
University of Florida freshman, frequented the area.
   ``We have a lot of information on Mr. Humphrey, but we have not
connected him to these murders,'' Ms. Darnell said.

<HEAD>Fujimori Announces Drug Agreement Deadline Extended by Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EMERY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alberto Fujimori says President Bush
extended the deadline for signing an agreement on U.S. anti-drug
aid, which Fujimori has criticized for lacking funding to help coca
farmers switch to other crops.
   Fujimori on Wednesday appeared to reject the $35.9 million in
economic aid, saying that since the package ``is destined only for
the fight against drug trafficking, we are not going to sign this
agreement.''
   Fujimori had said any agreement must include aid to wean farmers
away from growing coca leaves, the main ingredient for cocaine, and
persuade them to cultivate other cash crops. Better roads into
cities have been suggested as one solution.
   However, the Peruvian president told the state news agency
Andina that Bush on Friday extended a recently expired deadline for
agreement. Fujimori said he was confident the two nations would
negotiate an agreement by the end of the month.
   Fujimori met Friday with U.S. Ambassador Anthony Quaynton, who
delivered the message from Bush.
   The aid proposal includes $20 million to provide soldiers with
arms and equipment and to build a training camp in the coca-rich
Upper Huallaga Valley.
   The northern valley, 250 miles northeast of Lima, is the world's
largest supplier of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
   The army wants the agreement to focus on aid for fighting the
Maoist Shining Path rebels, according to the local news magazine
Caretas. The magazine said the United States wants the wording of
the agreement to state the aid is solely to fight drug trafficking.
   Opposition politicians have criticized the proposal, fearing it
could lead to direct U.S. involvement in a 10-year-old guerrilla
war that has claimed nearly 20,000 lives.
   The police, which direct Peruvian anti-drug efforts, already
operate with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration an anti-drug
helicopter base in the Huallaga Valley. Guerrillas attacked the
base in April, battling U.S. pilots.

<HEAD>Playmates Reveal Friend's Death After Extensive Search</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four playmates of a 10-year-old boy went for
weeks without revealing their friend had not vanished but had
plummeted 120 feet to his death from atop a deserted grain silo,
authorities say.
   The boys told their story Thursday after a nationwide,
five-month search failed to turn up Ricky Rodriguez.
   Ricky fell to his death in April while bouncing with his friends
on a conveyor belt stretched across the abandoned silo, the boys
told authorities.
   Ricky's body was discovered later Thursday right where one of
the friends said it would be, in the silo that once stored grain
for a deserted Falstaff Brewing Corp. plant, police said.
   ``They were scared. They're just little boys and they thought
they were going to get into trouble,'' said police Detective Eileen
Guest, a youth officer.
   Police had scoured Ricky's neighborhood, using helicopters and
scba divers to search for any trace. A picture of Ricky recently
was sent to millions of homes as part of a campaign to find missing
children.
   ``We searched everywhere we could think of for this boy,''
police Sgt. Rovert Jones said Friday.
   Police separately interviewed each of Ricky's four playmates,
all of them about 10 years old, and were convinced the boy's death
was an accident, Detective William Marley said.
   Ricky, a good student with caring parents, had stopped home
briefly the afternoon of April 26 to ask his father what time
dinner was. It was the last trace.
   One of Ricky's friends told police that keeping the secret made
the summer terrifying.
   ``He said he couldn't sleep, that he had been having
nightmares,'' Guest said.
   The mystery unraveled when a sister of one of the playmates
overheard a conversation in which some of the youngsters said Ricky
had fallen. She told her mother, who notified police.
   ``Well, everybody can stop looking,'' said Steve Rodriguez,
Ricky's father. ``I thought he was dead the night he disappeared.
It just didn't fit his pattern. But ... I was hoping.''

   South Korea launched regular ferry
service with China today for the first time since the Korean
peninsula was divided in 1945.
   A 4,300-ton ferryboat carrying 130 people left the western port
city of Inchon for Weihai on China's Shandong peninsula, the South
Korean news agency Yonhap reported.
   The boat will leave Inchon twice a week, Yonhap said. It will
fly a Panamanian flag because the two countries have no diplomatic
relations.
   South Korea has strengthened economic and non-political ties
with China, a close ally of Communist North Korea. In recent months
it has also increased ties with the Soviet Union and most of the
formerly Communist nations in Eastern Europe.
   China intervened on North Korea's side in the 1950-53 war
between the Koreas. The two Koreas have never signed a peace
treaty, and hundreds of thousands of troops guard their borders.

<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. military says it has
canceled a planned morale-boosting variety show for American troops
after the Saudi government objected to a burlesque dance routine.
   ``They objected in general, but it was pretty clear that it was
the women that set them off,'' said a military source who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Saudis complained to U.S. military officials after
monitoring the show on CBS, which broadcast a brief segment showing
four women dancers.
   Lt. Col. John Olsen, a U.S. military spokesman, said the
military decided it would not send audiences to the shows because
of the Saudi objections.
   ``(It) caused some discomfort on the part of the Saudi
government and we regret that,'' Olsen said.
   The episode is the latest in a series of incidents that have
caused increasing cultural strains between the Americans and their
Saudi hosts.
   Earlier in the week, the Saudi government complained to U.S.
commanders about American soldiers venturing into Saudi towns
carrying their weapons. Saudi officials have also been relaying
complaints about women in the military driving on Saudi roads.
Women are not allowed to drive here.
   The 90-minute show was being staged by a group of Americans,
Britons and other Westerners who wanted to show their appreciation
to the thousands of Americans deployed in Operation Desert Shield.
   At opening night Wednesday, 400 members of the 82nd Airborne
were repeatedly brought to their feet by the performers and many
said afterward that the show was a break from the heat, boredom and
isolation of the desert.
   A second show was staged Wednesday night and two more on
Thursday. But two planned for Friday night were effectively
canceled when military officials, responding to the Saudi
complaint, said they would not allow troops to attend.
   The troupe had planned to put on six shows next week and hoped
to continue the show for several weeks to allow troops to be
rotated in for entertainment while awaiting the arrival of
entertainers being brought in by the USO.
   ``We were just trying to give the guys a break,'' one of the
organizers of the show said, insisting on anonymity because of
fears she would be penalized for participating. ``We were worried
what might happen if the Saudis found out.''
   From the outset, Saudi and American officials have predicted
some cultural clashes as the 100,000-plus American troops settled
in and began to interract with Saudis.
   After weeks of relatively few incidents the last week has become
tense, with several U.S. commanders complaining privately the
Saudis appear unwilling to bend their traditions.
   Saudi offials in turn have complained the Americans were
unnecessarily engaging in activities that offended local customs.
   During a Thursday visit by Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, a Saudi official walked up to a senior
American officer and argued furiously that servicewomen be sent
home or at least prohibited from driving.
   The officer, Gen. Gus Pagonis, who is in charge of the logistics
and supply efforts for the U.S. deployment, could hardly get a word
in as the Saudi official, who refused to identify himself
afterward, insisted driving by women be halted.
   ``I'm trying to hold back but I must perform my mission,''
Pagonis told the official. ``They must perform the mission.''
   Saudi women appear in public draped in clothing that covers
their faces, arms and legs. Western women also are advised cover
their calves and arms when in public.

   Thunderstorms swept through parts of Arizona and Tennessee today
after heavy rain and winds pelted parts of the Midwest.
   The forecast called for scattered storms in the Southwest, the
Pacific Northwest and along the Gulf Coast.
   Showers were expected over the upper Midwest and along the East
Coast.
   Heavy rain Friday fell in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio. A
three-week heat wave in Nebraska ended.
   Tornadoes touched down near Fort Wayne, Ind., Dayton, Ohio, and
in southern Michigan, but there were no reports of injuries.
Thunderstorm winds toppled trees, tore at roofs and broke windows
in Michigan. At least two homes were destroyed in Ohio and damage
also was done in Indiana.
   Hail hit Tuscola, Mich., and heavy rain from strong storms
caused flooding of streets, small streams and low lying areas
around Three Rivers, Mich.
   Record temperatures were recorded in parts of Utah, Florida,
Colorado and Idaho, but the sizzling heat that had gripped Nebraska
since Aug. 23 dropped back into the seasonable 80's.
   The high temperature for the nation Friday was 109 degrees at
Bullhead City, Ariz.
   Hurricane Isidore moved northeast at 9 mph toward North Atlantic
shipping lanes. On Friday evening, its center was 700 miles south
southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, meteorologists said.

<HEAD>France Sending 4,000 Troops To Gulf, Expels Iraqi Attaches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand today announced
France will send 4,000 more soldiers to the Persian Gulf and he
expelled Iraqi military attaches, a day after an Iraqi raid on the
French diplomatic compound in Kuwait.
   Mitterrand said other Iraqi diplomats will be confined to Paris
in response to what he called Iraqi aggression against the French
Embassy in Kuwait. He also urged that the embargo against Iraq be
extended to air shipments.
   ``We will do what must be done,'' the French president said at a
press conference following an emergency meeting this morning of his
inner Cabinet.
   ``But we won't be taking hostages,'' he said.
   Iraqi troops raided the diplomatic compounds of France, Canada
and Belgium in Kuwait on Friday, briefly detaining five Western
consuls - including an American - and capturing four French
citizens.
   One of the four, France's military attache, was freed after
several hours. Mitterrand said in a press conference today that the
remaining three had joined other hostages held by Iraqi forces.
   The 4,000 troops to be sent to the gulf will include helicopter
and antitank units, Mitterrand said. He did not elaborate on just
where they would be stationed.
   France already has sent 180 paratroopers to the United Arab
Emirates and has nine warships in the region or enroute. The
aircraft carrier Clemenceau is among those that have arrived.
   The United States has deployed about 150,000 military personnel
in the Saudi Arabian desert south of Kuwait and on dozens of
warships in the region, where troops and ships of other nations
also have been sent.
   France will demand an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security
Council to examine holes in the United Nations embargo of Iraq and
occupied Kuwait, Mitterrand said.
   The embargo has been enforced by a massive buildup of naval
forces in the Persian Gulf. Mitterrand said France would continue
to rely on the embargo to dislodge Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
   To make the embargo more effective, it must be extended to air
traffic to and from Iraq and occupied Kuwait, Mitterrand said.
   In addition to throwing out the military attaches, France will
also expel 26 Iraqi civilian and military personnel who were taking
training courses here when Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   There courses were immediately suspended. The personnel have
been living under virtual house arrest in a handful of cities.

   English playwright Tom Stoppard's debut
movie, ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' captured the top
prize today at the Venice Film Festival.
   The film, starring Richard Dreyfuss, reinterprets Shakespeare's
``Hamlet'' from the point of view of the prince's two old school
chums, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who become unwittingly
involved in, and ultimately victims of, the power play between
Hamlet and his stepfather.
   A screen treatment of Stoppard's 1966 hit tragi-comic play by
the same name, the film was not generally expected to take the
Golden Lion prize despite the favorable reviews it received after
its screening.
   The favorite had been Martin Scorcese's ``Goodfellas,'' which
instead won the second place Silver Lion Award for direction. The
film provides a vividly realistic portrait of life in the American
underworld, with Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro in a supporting
role.
   The award for Best Actress went to Gloria Munchmeyer for her
starring role in Chilean director Silvio Caiozzi's film ``La Luna
En El Espejo'' (The Moon in the Mirror).
   The Best Actor award went to Oleg Borisov, protagonist of
``Edinstvenijat Svidetel,'' (The Only Witness) by Bulgarian
director Michail Pandurski.
   New Zealand director Jane Campion's entry, ``An Angel at My
Table,'' won the jury's ``special grand prize,'' and received a
long standing ovation from an appreciative crowd at the awards
ceremony.
   A nine-person jury headed by American author Gore Vidal judged
the 21 films from 18 countries running in the competition at this
year's 47th edition of the festival.
   Meanwhile, some critics at the festival have blasted ``Henry and
June,'' a controversial American movie about Henry Miller that has
earned an ``X'' rating for its erotic scenes.
   But many critics at the festival, which ends today, also have
signed a petition urging the repeal of the ``X'' rating on grounds
that it limits artistic freedom.
   Set in the literary scene in Paris in the 1930s, the film is
based on sections of the diaries of Anais Nin and the
autobiographical novels of Miller, an American expatriate. Both
Miller and Nin were entranced with the young June Smith.
   ``It was just a bad film,'' commented Irene Bignardi, critic of
Rome's La Repubblica, after the world premiere Friday. ``But even
Americans who are rather infantile would not be shocked by it.''
   ``It's enough to put you off sex,'' quipped The Guardian's
critic, Derek Malcolm.
   The film stars Swedish-American Uma Thurman, whose first break
came as a seduced adolescent in Stephen Frears' ``Dangerous
Liaisons.'' It was directed by Philip Kaufman, whose other movies
include ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and ``The Right
Stuff.''
   Produced by Universal Pictures, the film was rated ``X'' last
month by the U.S. Motion Picture Association's rating board,
meaning no one under 17 can be admitted for viewing.
   Universal has vowed to appeal the rating in an attempt to
challenge the 22-year-old rating system.

   Jim Lord's basement is chock-full of
tractor-trailers, moving vans, dump trucks and gasoline tankers.
There's so many of them, the traffic jam has spread to his barn.
   At last count, the retired pipefitter had 2,700 toy trucks, but
not just any trucks. The ones Lord collects are reproductions of
big-name company haulers that can't be found in stores.
   Lord, 75, is one of about 4,000 enthusiasts to search out the
handcrafted gems made by Winross Co. for such companies as Exxon
Corp., the Adolph Coors Co. and Campbell Soup Co.
   ``You can't get them in stores, so we have to find out about
them via the grapevine,'' he said recently. ``It's really the
challenge of getting them that makes them so sought-after.''
   The 6-inch-long trucks are sold to companies by Winross, a
family-owned business in Rochester, N.Y., for about $30 each. They
look like the companies' real trucks, logos included, and are used
as promotional giveaways.
   When Winross makes too many of one model, it sells off the
overflow to enthusiasts. Lord also finds rare models at toy shows
or buys them from other collectors.
   Winross began making the silk-screened, metal toy trucks about
30 years ago. They were initially sold retail, but then the company
began filling only bulk orders for companies that wanted their
logos advertised.
   ``We were amazed that people got so interested in collecting
them,'' said Phyllis Austin, co-owner of Winross.
   ``I still don't understand it. I always thought of collectibles
as being things that were antique. These become collectible as soon
as we make them,'' she said Thursday.
   Lord says he's long been a collector of items ranging from
stamps to Matchbox toy cars.
   He became interested in Winross trucks in the mid-1970s. Now,
shelves of the toy vehicles line his basement, leaving room for
only a washer and a dryer. More of them are beginning to fill his
barn.
   Winross does not put out a complete list of all models it makes,
so Lord does the job himself.
   In 1977, he began compiling and publishing a list of Winross
trucks he knew existed. Subscribers pay $2 a year for his monthly
newsletter. Lord also sells a photo catalog of the latest truck
models for $70 to $80.
   He resells duplicate models for up to $400, using the profit to
buy the nearly 250 new trucks he estimates Winross puts out every
year. Lord estimates his collection is worth about $150,000.
   Lord's wife, who recently died, never shared his enthusiasm for
model trucks.
   ``My wife put up with me,'' he says. ``The rule was no toys
upstairs, but she never minded me having them.''

   Democratic Party Chairman Ronald H. Brown said
today his party stands firmly behind President Bush's Persian Gulf
policy. ``Saddam Hussein will get no mixed signals from America or
from this party,'' he said.
   In a speech to a meeting of the Democratic National Committee,
Brown coupled his support for the U.S. commitment in the Middle
East with a slashing attack on Republican domestic policy.
   ``We'll stand up to Saddam Hussein, but we won't stand by as the
new Republican recession wreaks havoc on our economy,'' he said.
   Democratic Party leaders, meeting today uptown from the White
House, are formally endorsing Bush's decision to send troops to
block Iraq's aggression in the Middle East.
   But that backing for the Republican president doesn't extend to
his domestic policy, which the Democrats say characterize a
``decade of Republican greed and debt.''
   On the agenda for the meeting of the Democratic National
Committee were resolutions denouncing ``the failure of three
successive Republican administrations to develop a national energy
policy'' and blaming the GOP for the savings and loan crisis.
   The resolution demanded that the president ``explain why
high-ranking Bush administration officials have made concerted
efforts to suppress new conservation measures developed to respond
to the Iraqi oil crisis.''
   Brown praised the party regulars for completing what he called
``housekeeping'' matters related to the 1992 nominating convention.
   At a record early date, the Democrats have selected their
convention city - New York - and now are ready to adopt the
convention call, which includes the formula for allocating
delegates.
   The number of delegates allocated to individual states won't be
determined until after the final 1990 Census figures define changes
in House seats and the November elections change the political
makeup of the nation's governorships.
   What is known is that the 1992 convention, like the 1988, will
have more than 4,000 delegates. Each Democratic convention is
always a little larger than the one before and the 1992 meeting
will have at least 80 more unpledged delegates.
   That allocation was inserted into the call to please state party
leaders who wanted additional slots for state and party officials.
   A highlight of the meeting Friday of the party's executive
committee was the appearance of Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., a figure
never before seen at a national committee meeting.
   Five years ago, Nunn was a founder of the Democratic Leadership
Council which was created as a conservative counterweight to the
national party.
   Nunn's denied his appearance before the executive committee was
a signal of his interest in running for president in 1992.
   ``I have no inclinations or plans to run for president,'' Nunn
told reporters who crowded around him as he left the party meeting.
   But the senator continues to stir presidential speculation with
such actions as his resignation from an all-male golf club and his
recent declaration of support for abortion rights after decades of
being in the opposition camp.
   Nunn said his interest in party politics began with formation of
the DLC which he described as an effort to ``get the Democratic
Party back in the mainstream.''
   Asked if he believed the people he'd just spoken to were now in
the mainstream, Nunn replied, ``Well, I don't know everybody
here.''
   Nunn said he didn't believe the tendency of Americans to rally
around the president in a time of crisis would hurt Democratic
candidates in the fall.
   ``I don't think it's a partisan issue,'' he said. ``I don't
think the public's going to be voting in November based on the
Middle East.''
   The executive committee approved without dissent a resolution
that began by saying: ``Today, our nation stands united in support
of America's mission in the Middle East, united in opposition to
Iraq's aggression. We, the Democratic Party of the United States,
do here formally express our support for our armed forces and the
Persian Gulf policy of our commander in chief.''
   But the next paragraph called on the nation to ``abandon
Republican economic policies.''
   The party voiced agreement with Bush's call for spending
reductions but added, ``We insist that those reductions must not
discriminate against those who benefited least from a decade of
Republican greed and debt.''
   It said, ``The S&amp;L crisis is the certain result of do-nothing
Republican public philosophy, hear-nothing Republican regulatory
policy, and see-nothing Republican administration of justice.''

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ordered
the release of a 25-year-old Connecticut man in Baghdad after
receiving a written plea from his mother, a spokesman at the Iraqi
Embassy in Washington said.
   Thomas Hart Benton Ewald, 25, was one of about 250 Americans
allowed to leave Baghdad on a U.S.-chartered flight that arrived in
London late Friday, U.S. officials confirmed.
   Saddam Hussein ``gave the order to allow him to go free and to
return to his nation,'' said Iraqi spokesman Riyadh Jawad. ``His
excellency, he wants to give examples to prove that our behavior is
not aggressive to our guests.''
   ``We did not treat them as hostages as in Lebanon. . . . We
treat them as guests in our country,'' he said.
   Jawad said Mary Ewald's plea for her son's release was the only
one the Iraqi embassy has received and that Saddam is open to other
humanitarian pleas.
   Ewald was one of only a few men on the plane carrying almost 400
passengers. Iraq has been holding most foreign men hostage, while
releasing women and children.
   Ewald, of Greenwich, was scheduled to arrive at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport later today after an
overnight stop in London, said U.S. Chief of Protocol Joseph Verner
Reed.
   Ewald began work this summer with the Al-Ahli Bank of Kuwait,
arriving in Kuwait City two days before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion,
Mrs. Ewald said.
   Jawad said he believed Ewald had been moved from Kuwait to Iraq
after the invasion. He was allowed to enter the U.S. Embassy
compound in Baghdad on Thursday.
   Jawad said the Iraqi Embassy received Mary Ewald's letter about
one week ago and forwarded it to Baghdad.
   ``After two, three days, (Saddam) ordered to allow (Ewald) to
return to his nation,'' said Jawad.
   Mrs. Ewald declined to release a copy of the letter.
   Ewald called his parents from London on Friday and told them
that people still being held hostage wished him well, said his
father, William Ewald.
   ``When the other hostages learned he was being released they
said `Tell your mom we're proud of her,' '' the elder Ewald said.
   ``We are grateful for him having responded this way with Tom,''
the elder Ewald said. ``It was a humanitarian appeal and
response.''
   ``I also hope the other hostages get out,'' said Mrs. Ewald.
``Their parents and families are still going through this.''
   About 1,350 Americans remain in Kuwait and 200 in Iraq, with
about 75 being held as so-called human shields, according to the
State Department.

   A bomb exploded inside a metal sculpture
outside the federal building early today, causing some damage to
the building but no injuries, police said.
   The explosion, which may have been a prank, was felt blocks
away, said police Lt. Randy Nisleit.
   ``Some people in the area saw four `military-looking type'
people running from the area and laughing, so it was probably just
a prank of some kind. But we're checking the area out just in
case,'' Nisleit said.
   He said the device appeared to be a pipe bomb attached to a
freon gas cannister to give it more explosive force.
   ``There's a large piece of modern art sculpture in front of the
building, and they apparently threw some kind of charge down one of
the tubes,'' Nisleit said.
   He said the 12:45 a.m. explosion shattered a large window in the
building and damaged a guardrail, but did little damage to the
sculpture.
   ``A few people called who live blocks away to say the blast
shook the ground, so (the explosion) must have been substantial,''
Nisleit said.
   Agents from the FBI, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, and the Fire Department's Metro Arson Strike Team were
also investigating.

   The United Auto Workers union and General Motors
Corp. resumed contract talks today after extending the current pact
for more negotiations affecting about 300,000 workers nationwide.
   The union appealed to workers to stay on the job while
bargaining continued today.
   ``Until you are notified otherwise ... I urge you to demonstrate
solidarity and discipline and report to work as scheduled,'' UAW
Vice President Stephen Yokich said on a telephone recording for UAW
members.
   Negotiators had faced a midnight deadline, but the deadline was
extended after hours of talking Friday. The union and the world's
largest automaker agreed to extend the current, three-year contract
on a day-to-day basis.
   Talks resumed at 8 a.m. today after breaking for the night at
12:40 a.m.
   The only GM assembly plant scheduled for operation today in the
United States was the Corvette factory in Bowling Green, Ky.
   Meanwhile in Canada, the Canadian Auto Workers union struck Ford
Motor Co. when that union's contract with the No. 2 U.S.
automaker's Canadian subsidiary expired at midnight Friday.
   About 12,800 unionized Ford workers were on strike early today.
None of Ford's Canadian plants was scheduled to operate during the
weekend. Talks resumed this morning in Toronto.
   In the United States, the GM workers were among more than
450,000 active workers employed by GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. whose UAW contracts technically expired at midnight Friday.
   The union froze negotiations at Ford and Chrysler pending the
outcome of the GM talks. The UAW plans to use an agreement ratified
by GM workers as a pattern for contracts with Ford and Chrysler.
   When the GM-UAW contract extension was implemented, there was no
official word from GM or the union about what issues remained
unresolved. Bargaining Friday included job security, health care,
wages and pensions.
   Union members nationwide have been kept pretty much in the dark
about the talks going on at GM headquarters in Detroit.
   That has caused some problems.
   Gary Sorrell, president of UAW Local 977 at GM's Marion, Ohio,
stamping plant said he and other leaders were feeling some heat
from members.
   The extension, he said, ``put us in a situation where the
members feel we're keeping something from them, and we're not.''
   Speculation about the extension rose during the final days of
the 1987 GM-UAW national agreement. Friday night, the union was
faced with three choices: sign a tentative agreement, extend the
existing contract or strike.
   ``I think with the economy today and with the market share we
have today, we couldn't afford to strike,'' said Paul Mitchell,
financial secretary of UAW Local 5960 at GM's Lake Orion car
assembly plant near Pontiac, Mich.
   During the 1980s, the Big Three's collective market share
dropped about 6 percentage points to about 68 percent last year.
During the same time, the Japanese companies' share rose by about
the same amount to more than 25 percent.
   That forced GM, Ford and Chrysler to shrink their operations and
their work forces. In response, the UAW's primary emphasis has
shifted to job security from wage increases.
   The last time the UAW struck GM was in 1984. That walkout, which
affected about two dozen factories, lasted a week.

<TEXT>
   Democrat John Silber is trying to recover from his
latest political blunder while Republican William Weld is enjoying
a last-minute surge as primary election day approaches in the
chaotic Massachusetts governor's race.
   Weld is running Tuesday against State House Minority Leader
Steven Pierce, with Republicans in the best position in two decades
to capture the governorship they last won in 1970.
   During the tenure of Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts Miracle
of economic growth has become an economic debacle.
   The state that once had the lowest unemployment rate among major
industrial states now is tied for second highest at 6.7 percent.
After his unsuccessful bid for the presidency, Dukakis returned to
a state heading for serious economic trouble and announced he
wouldn't seek re-election.
   The Legislature passed the largest tax increase in the state's
history this year, $1.2 billion, but the current budget already is
spiraling into deficit.
   ``I think either Republican would be highly competitive,'' said
Ralph Whitehead, a University of Massachusetts journalism professor
and political analyst. ``This is going to be a tightly contested
election.''
   Weld, who is independently wealthy, has pumped more than $1
million of his own money into the campaign.
   Pierce had maintained a comfortable lead in polls, but Weld has
surged within striking distance.
   Weld, a former federal prosecutor, credited his campaign's
resurrection to his summer-long whistle-stops and to his
performance in two televised debates where he was considered more
aggressive than Pierce.
   The two candidates and political analysts predict dwindling
interest in the Democratic contest may attract a record number of
the state's 1.35 million independents to the GOP primary.
   Weld and Pierce support a tax rollback initiative on the
November ballot. Pierce is personally opposed to abortion, while
Weld favors abortion rights.
   On the Democratic side, Silber faces the front-running former
state attorney general, Francis Bellotti, who benefited from Lt.
Gov. Evelyn Murphy's decision earlier this month to drop out of the
race.
   Silber's campaign has been marked by controversies over
harsh-sounding statements - they became known as ``Silber
shockers'' - concerning immigrants, welfare mothers and health care
for the elderly.
   The latest flap came during a televised debate, with Silber
saying he saw no point going to an inner city area to talk to a ``a
group of drug addicts'' about crime.
   Later, Silber said he did not mean to imply that all residents
of the predominantly minority area were on drugs.
   Bellotti's performance in the debate was lackluster and even he
admitted that his stumbling closing statement was ``terrible,
terrible.''
   Independent tracking polls conducted for The Boston Globe and
WBZ-TV showed Bellotti with a commanding lead after the Tuesday
debate, but Silber's campaign said its polling showed a tighter
race.
   Murphy, who was tied in voters' minds with Dukakis, trailed
badly in public opinion polls and fund raising when she dropped
out.
   Her decision to leave the race came after she attempted to
impose a different budget-cutting plan than Dukakis while the
governor was on a European trade mission.
   Whitehead said Silber's campaign was shot when Murphy left the
race and the Democratic political establishment united behind
Bellotti.
   ``Silber never had a chance in a two-person field,'' Whitehead
said.
   One of Silber's leading supporters, state Senate President
William Bulger, remained confident.
   ``I tell you what the `Silber shocker's' going to be next
Tuesday: Silber wins,'' he said while making a campaign swing
through western Massachusetts.
   In the U.S. Senate race, incumbent Democrat John F. Kerry is
unopposed in Tuesday's primary. Two Republican businessmen, James
Rappaport and Dan Daly, are competing for the GOP nomination, with
Rappaport considered the favorite.
   The only serious congressional primary involving an incumbent is
in the district of Democrat Richard Neal of Springfield, a former
mayor being challenged by another former mayor, Theodore DiMauro.
   Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, reprimanded by the House for his
relationship with a male prostitute, is unopposed in the primary
but will face some Republican opposition in the general election.
   Elections were scheduled in two other states Tuesday. In
Oklahoma, there will be run-off elections to choose a Democrat and
Republican nominee for governor. In Washington, where there is no
Senate or governor's race, voters were selecting party nominees for
the U.S. House.

   A freight car once used to transport Nazi

Polish railway workers to Israel's Holocaust museum.
   Aleksander Janiszewski, director general of the Polish State
Railways, presented the ``death wagon'' to the Yad Vashem Holocaust

   Zvi Rav-Ner, the Israeli charge d'affaires in Warsaw, accepted
the gift on behalf of the Jerusalem-based memorial organization.
   ``We will never forget all those Poles who saved Jews from
destruction, often paying the highest price of their own life for
this,'' said the Israeli diplomat.
   The wagon was recently found at a railway repair shop in
southern Poland and renovated in World War II style.
   The Nazis transported millions of people, mostly Jews, by
freight trains to death and concentration camps around Europe
during the war.
   An estimated 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust.

   On a hot, overcast day last June, as a band

announced the formation of elite platoons that would be dispatched
to the front lines in his administration's war on savings and loan
fraud.
   The new ``rapid response teams,'' Bush said, would be ``teams of
razor-sharp prosecutors and auditors ... striking city by city,
teams that will jump right into the paper chase, teams that will
hit the trail while that trail is still hot.''
   The paper trail of S&amp;L fraud may have cooled a bit since June,
but so far, at least, the new teams apparently haven't responded
rapidly - or at all.
   ``There is just no business for these people right now,''
Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett said this past week.
``They really haven't done anything at this point.''
   Tillett said the new teams of hundreds of lawyers and
accountants coordinated by the department are intended to be a
``resource pool'' that can be tapped by S&amp;L enforcers already in
the field. So far, he said, the U.S. attorneys, FBI agents and
support staff already investigating S&amp;L fraud in locations around
the country haven't needed to call on the specialized expertise of
the new squads.
   ``I find it very hard to believe that there is no work for the
rapid response teams,'' said Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., a
member of House Banking Committee, which is investigating the
savings and loan crisis.
   ``The American public assumed that fast action was forthcoming''
after the teams were appointed, he said. ``I'm sure they would be
shocked to learn that S&amp;L fraud has dissipated so greatly that
urgency may no longer be needed.
   ``There are a great deal of allegations to be investigated,''
Schumer said. ``Every resource possible should be used to its
fullest.''
   More than 165 people have been convicted in S&amp;L cases since
October 1988, but the Justice Department has a backlog of 21,000
cases.
   James G. Richmond, the Justice Department official appointed to
direct the teams, said this summer that the fraud squads would be
available whenever local investigators needed their special
expertise.
   But so far, Tillett said, local prosecutors are ``dealing with
things they've seen before.''
   ``They haven't been thrown any curve balls at this point,'' he
said.
   In the Dallas area, for example, where a special task force has
been prosecuting some of the largest and most scandalous S&amp;L fraud
cases for some time, the locals have had only an ``educational''
contact with the new teams.
   The help from Washington hasn't been needed ``because of the
large presence we already have,'' said Marvin Collins, the U.S.
attorney for northern Texas in Fort Worth.
   Bush's announcement of his new initiative on June 22 followed
weeks of heated criticism by Democrats that the administration was
not vigorously prosecuting S&amp;L fraud.
   Abuse by some thrift operators was partly responsible for the
collapse of hundreds of institutions in recent years. It will cost
U.S. taxpayers an estimated $500 billion to pay for the bailout of
the federally insured S&amp;Ls.
   The scandal had reached Bush's doorstep. His son Neil had made a
highly publicized appearance in May before a congressional
committee investigating the $1 billion collapse of a Colorado
thrift, Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association.
   Federal regulators have accused Neil Bush, 35, of conflict of
interest in his role as a former director of Silverado.
   In addition to establishing the S&amp;L fraud squads, the president
also moved to double spending for Justice Department and Internal
Revenue Service S&amp;L investigators and prosecutors from $50 million
to $100 million in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   Bush also created the new special counsel position at Justice -
the administration's ``top gun'' on S&amp;L fraud.
   ``My mandate is to basically get this entire program of
administration initiatives up and running,'' Richmond told the AP
this summer. ``We need to put those people in jail and call them to
account for their conduct.''
   Richmond, a large, jovial man who also seems to have a tough-guy
aspect, has been both an FBI agent and a lawyer in private
practice. He bristled at the suggestion that the new fraud teams
and interagency group might be a showpiece, adding another layer to
the federal bureaucracy.
   ``The purpose is to cut through the bureaucracy,'' he said,
noting that government employees in the S&amp;L enforcement effort have
easy access to him.
   ``We'll be here long after the klieg lights are gone on this
issue,'' Richmond said.

   Mother Teresa said Saturday she hopes to
open eight more missions in the Soviet Union and send nuns to
Albania, an officially atheist nation.
   The 80-year-old Nobel laureate also said she received permission
from ``my friend Fidel Castro'' to increase the number of homes
operated by the Missionaries of Charity in Cuba from four to seven.
   Asked about the Persian Gulf crisis, she said, ``People have
told me to write to (Iraqi) President Saddam (Hussein), and I am
thinking about it.''
   Mother Teresa, who was recently re-elected head of the order
despite her request for retirement, was in Vatican City to address
an international priests' retreat and meet with Pope John Paul II.
   She said she seeks to have 15 homes for the poor and outcast in
the Soviet Union. Her order currently has six homes in the Soviet
Union and has been invited to open seven more, she said.
   She also said she asked Albania's leader Ramiz Alia if she could
send nuns to the country, which is slowly undergoing reforms after
years of strict isolationism.
   ``He wrote back asking me to go there, but I answered, `I can't
go without my family, which consists of my fellow nuns,' and I am
praying that this will happen,'' said Mother Teresa, who was in
Vatican City to address an international priests' retreat and meet
with Pope John Paul II.
   Mother Teresa was born in Skopje, Yugoslavia, to ethnic Albanian
parents.
   The Missionaries of Charity operate about 430 homes in 95
nations. The order has about 3,000 nuns.

   More than 400,000 government workers,
reserve forces and soldiers were mobilized Saturday to help clean
up after flooding from the nation's worst rainstorms on record.
   In Seoul, army reservists with shovels and brooms mopped up
muddy roads, and others collected piles of trash.
   The Central Disaster Relief Center put the death toll from three
days of torrential rains last week at 114. Officials said 37 others
were reported missing and some 180,000 people were left homeless.
   Officials said damage to homes, farmland, roads and public
utilities would top $400 million.

   Almost 800 people have died in black faction
fighting in townships around Johannesburg since August. Here is a
firsthand account of one of those deaths.

   The sun rose brightly in Soweto
Saturday, shining through the smoky haze. People walked along the
roads and swept their red dirt yards. Dogs scampered through piles
of garbage.
   At Inhlazane train station, a man would soon die.
   Shortly after dawn, groups of residents milled about on one side
of the train platform. They pointed at a small crowd of blacks on
the other side of the tracks who live in a nearby migrant workers
hostel.
   The station formed a 150-yard barrier between them. When trains
arrived, people getting off crouched low and scurried across the
platform and tracks, using the coaches as a shield.
   Someone fired a handgun. Everyone ducked.
   Robin Oupa, 36, said he was supposed to go to work at a
hospital. ``Right now, I can't even go to the (train) terminal,''
he said.
   On the platform, a group armed with machetes and crude spears
questioned people getting off a train. Suddenly, they began pushing
a large man in a blue worksuit down the stairs toward the street.
   The man resisted but did not fight. More people joined the
shouting crowd.
   Attackers kicked the man, then hit him with fist-sized stones.
Several plunged small daggers into his head, back and chest.
   They kicked him down and some hurled boulders the size of anvils
at his head.
   He continued to crawl. More rocks hit him and he collapsed.
Someone poured petrol on him.
   When the match struck, he burst into flames and leaped in the
air. Onlookers yelled what sounded like a cheer. A woman danced.
   He ran in circles before falling for the last time. A youth
hacked at his head with a machete.
   Some attackers said the man had failed to correctly answer their
questions. They said he was a Zulu spy from the hostel dwellers on
the other side of the tracks.
   Oupa said Zulu supporters of the conservative Inkatha movement
lived in the hostel. He said they attacked residents of the small,
brown houses on the near side, most of whom support the African
National Congress.
   ``They take a young boy, kill him and cut off his private
parts,'' he said. ``Those people are wrong. ... When they kill a
young boy, it is wrong.''
   Inkatha blames the ANC for the fighting. Charges of police and
right-wing whites provoking the ongoing violence also have
surfaced.
   Attacks on trains and taxis last week killed dozens of blacks.
   ``We can't go by trains, no taxis, what can we do?'' Oupa said.
``We must fight.''

<HEAD>Capital A Kinder, Cleaner Place For Asian Games</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This city of gritty air, bicycle gridlock and
hostile sales clerks has become a kinder, cleaner, emptier place on
the eve of hosting its first major world sports event, the Asian
Games.
   The repaved streets are lined with flowers. Buildings have been
washed and painted, with false facades hiding the ugliest houses.
An army of 20,000 students patrols the sidewalks, ready to fine
spitters or litterbugs.
   Most out-of-town Chinese visitors, averaging 1 million per day,
have been ordered to stay home. Vehicle traffic also has been cut
for the Sept. 22-Oct. 7 games, a kind of Olympics for 38 Asian and
Mideast nations.
   Most striking of all, China's normally cranky service personnel
are being polite - to foreigners, anyway.
   ``Can I help you?'' clerks rush to ask in newly learned English
in hotels and shops adjoining the shiny new Asian Games Village.
   Even police have added ``please'' and ``thank you'' to their
vocabularies as Beijing orchestrates an unprecedented public
relations campaign directed at an often critical outside world.
   ``Of course it is a political event more than a sports event,''
said a Chinese reporter.
   The Communist leadership is determined to vindicate socialism,
and especially the army attack that killed hundreds of peaceful
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing last year, drawing
international condemnation.
   Officials have said the 100,000 foreign tourists expected in the
city of 10 million for the games will see firsthand a China that is
stable and loyal to the Communist Party.
   To ensure nothing happens to spoil that, work units across the
city are telling their employees to stay off the streets on the
games' opening day, and watch the ceremonies on television.
   Large gatherings are banned for the 17-day period and college
students, China's most volatile citizens, are to stay on campus.
   Security is at its heaviest since martial law was lifted in
January. Paramilitary police drill openly with riot gear and
helicopters buzz overhead in unexplained security exercises.
   Appeals for cooperation and order are being made in the name of
patriotism, not sportsmanship. The tens of thousands of students
and office workers who spent weekends aiding a last-minute dash to
finish building stadiums and hotels were told that voluntary labor
is a ``glorious revolutionary tradition.''
   Privately, many Beijing residents say they are sick of the Asian
Games even before they start. Most of the nightly television news
has been given over to progress reports on the preparations, and
messages on public etiquette during the games are everywhere.
   Hardly a storefront in the city lacks decals of Pan Pan, the
games' smiling panda mascot.
   The Beijing television news perhaps inadvertently acknowledged
the public annoyance in brief footage shown this summer. An irate
bicyclist being fined for violating traffic regulations was shown
screaming at a policeman, ``Everything is Asian Games. It's all
nonsense.''
   Normally unruly Beijing commuters are learning that it pays to
obey traffic rules these days. Some private street vendors and
repairmen have been ordered out of business on the grounds that
their operations are unattractive.
   Supplies of electricity to other parts of the city are being cut
so the games venues can have enough. Heavily polluting factories
are being shut down for the term of the games.
   People with unregistered pets are being ordered to kill them to
reduce the chance of a rabies outbreak.
   Heavy trucks and vehicles deemed unattractive, such as locally
made jeeps, are barred from main roads.
   But authorities don't want to hear any complaints.
   Chinese sources say that officials in their work units have
warned that all public comments on the Asian Games must be
positive. For malcontents, the message is summed up in a proverb:
``The bird that sticks out its head will be shot down.''

   France announced today it will dispatch 4,000 more soldiers to
the Persian Gulf and expel Iraqi military attaches in Paris in
response to Iraq's raids on French, Belgian and Canadian diplomatic
compounds in Kuwait.
   ``We will do what must be done,'' French President Francois
Mitterrand told a news conference following an emergency Cabinet
meeting. ``But we won't be taking hostages.''
   President Bush pledged beforehand to support any French response
to Friday's raids.
   Bush also said the U.S. Navy fired warning shots and boarded an
Iraqi tanker in the Gulf of Oman on Friday as part of the effort to
enforce trade sanctions against the Baghdad government.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today after meeting
with West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher that Bonn
has made a ``significant'' offer of financial help for the U.S.-led
campaign against Iraq.
   But Baker said he did not want to reveal the exact figures until
after meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl later in the day.
   In other developments, another planeload of Americans left
London for the United States today after their release from Iraq
and Kuwait. Iraq is holding Westerners as human shields to deter
any attack by U.S. forces in the gulf.
   Also, one report said Iraqi troops were eating zoo animals in
Kuwait, where food has been short since the world embargo against
Iraq's invasion of the country six weeks ago.
   In Madrid, the chairman of NATO's Military Committee appealed
today for more multinational force deployments to be committed to
the gulf.
   ``We should be prepared for a sustained operation if that's what
is necessary to avoid war, '' said Norwegian Adm. Vigleik Eide, the
committee chairman, at a news conference.``That's why it's so
important to have more military contributions as well as logistical
support.''
   Iraqi troops raided the diplomatic compounds of France, Canada
and Belgium in Kuwait on Friday, briefly detaining five Western
consuls and capturing four French citizens, including the French
military attache.
   The diplomat was freed after several hours, but Mitterrand said
today the others were sent to join about 400 French nationals
already held by Iraqi forces.
   Mitterrand also urged widening the U.N. embargo of Iraq and
occupied Kuwait to air traffic.
   The new French forces bound for Saudi Arabia include a squadron
of 30 warplanes, an 1,100-man helicopter regiment with 48 combat
choppers, an armored regiment with 48 tanks, and an infantry
regiment with anti-tank and anti-air missiles.
   France already has nine warships in the gulf region as well as
300 ground troops in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, for
a total of 3,800 servicemen.
   In addition to throwing out the military attaches in Paris,
France will also expel 26 Iraqi civilian and military personnel who
were taking training courses when Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Iraqi Ambassador to France Abdelrazzek al Hachimi said Iraq
``will take reciprocal measures at a diplomatic level.'' He did not
specify what those measures would be.
   Baker told Italian officials today the next six weeks will be
crucial for efforts to resolve the gulf crisis.
   Asked whether Baker meant there would be no hope for a
diplomatic solution beyond that period and military action then
would be the only recourse, an Italian government spokesman said he
was not authorized to interpret the remarks.
   Iraq denied its soldiers entered the foreign compounds and said
the troops were under strict orders not to enter the embassies.
   Saddam's troops invaded and annexed Kuwait after the Baghdad
government demanded the oil-rich emirate relinquish border
territory, compensate for billions in oil pumped from disputed land
and forgive billions in loans.
   The invsion prompted a U.N. embargo and a multinational
military effort to deter possible Iraqi aggression.
   Late Friday, an Iraqi Airways jetliner landed at London's
Gatwick airport with more than 350 evacuees, mostly American women
and children. The Americans, believed to be among the last who
agreed to leave behind their husbands and fathers in Kuwait, were
traveling to the Washington area this afternoon.
   About 2,200 Americans remain captive in Iraq and Kuwait, and
some Western men have been transferred to strategic Iraqi
installations to deter attacks by Western forces.
   Galina Suliman of San Francisco, who arrived on the Boeing 747
from Baghdad, said before the plane took off for the United States:
``The Kuwaiti resistance has been put down ruthlessly by the Iraqis
in the past day or two.''
   Another passenger, Andrea Hanson from Portland, Ore., said
Kuwaiti groups did not have enough weapons to fight the Iraqis.
   The Times of London today quoted Victor Watkins, an official of
the World Society for the Protection of Animals, as saying Iraqi
soldiers in Kuwait have eaten 70 percent of the edible animals in
Kuwait's zoo. The newspaper did not specify how Watkins got his
information or how many animals were in the zoo.
   ``It is a dreadful situation. Things are desperate enough for
the people, so anyone might understand how bad it is for the
animals,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Iraq has an estimated 265,000 troops in and around Kuwait.
   The United States has led the multinational buildup in Saudi
Arabia and the gulf, with 150,000 troops and more than 30 warships
in the region.
   Britain on Friday said it was sending the 7th Armored Brigade,
successors to the Desert Rats of World War II, to Saudi Arabia with
120 tanks and 6,000 combat troops to bolster the multinational
force.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said a squadron of 12
CF-18 jets would be sent to fly cover for three Canadian warships
en route to the gulf.
   Several other nations, including Italy, Belgium and South Korea,
pledged either money or equipment Friday to support the
multinational contingent.
   Baker this week urged NATO allies to send ground troops, even in
token numbers, to symbolize shared involvement with the military
buildup. Baker's meeting with Italian officials in Rome came before
his West German trip.
   A day earlier, the West German government - prevented by its
constitution from deploying forces outside the NATO area - said it
had given Washington a list of more than 50 merchant ships that
could be used to transport American troops to the gulf.
   Bush on Friday asked Congress for $1.9 billion more to cover the
costs of deploying the U.S. troops in the Middle East. Operation
Desert Shield is costing Washington an estimated $1 billion a
month, officials have said.
   The administration also is preparing ask Congress to approve the
sale to Saudi Arabia of $18 billion in weapons, including F-15
fighter jets, tanks and other sophisticated arms, a U.S. official
said on condition of anonymity. The administration has already
proposed selling Saudi Arabia $3 billion in new weapons to bolster
its defenses, congressional sources said.
   A senior security officer in Egypt said today Cairo is
intensifying its campaign against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait by
restricting entry of Iraqis and citizens of Arab countries that
support President Saddam Hussein. The official said the curbs apply
to Jordanians, Yemenis and Palestinians.

<HEAD>For Exiled Kuwaiti Children, Luxury Is No Cure For Homesickness</HEAD>

   DIVONNE-LES-BAINS, France (AP) - Although she lives in a posh
vacation villa and rides to school in a luxury car, 12-year-old
Dalal finds that enforced exile is no fun. Tears of homesickness
give her away.
   Dalal is one of 60 Kuwaiti children who last week entered French
public schools in this spa town 11 miles north of Geneva. Their
wealthy families, who for years have spent summers here, were
stranded when Iraqi forces occupied Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The children face the prospect of their first cold winter - and
their first taste of financial hardship.
   During a recess, Dalal turned on her Walkman casette player to
listen to patriotic Kuwaiti songs. She began sobbing, and two of
her Kuwaiti friends, clad in tight blue jeans and baggy
sweatshirts, cried with her.
   ``Living in France is not a problem - the people are very
kind,'' said 16-year-old Shaika. ``The trouble is that we are
outside our country and we can't go home. We feel alone, but when
we talk to each other it helps.''
   Divonne-Les-Bains, a town of 6,000 people nestled in the
foothills of the Jura Mountains, boasts luxury hotels, a man-made
lake with sand beaches, a casino, golf course and race track.
   Several dozen Kuwaiti families live in lakeside and hillside
villas surrounded by high iron fences. Many of the homes have
tennis courts, swimming pools, and satellite dishes.
   The families are worried about security, and school officials
asked that the children be identified only by their first names.
But the students spoke freely about the new uncertainties in their
lives.
   They said their families had become budget-conscious for the
first time because some bank accounts were inaccessible. Kuwaiti
assets were frozen by many governments in order to shield them from
plunder by the Iraqis.
   ``My parents used to take us out to dinner all the time,'' Dalal
said. ``Now its out to the supermarket and back.''
   ``We used to go shopping and choose anything we like. We had
everything,'' added Hawazen, 16. ``Now my mother tells me to pick
something cheap, something I'll wear a lot.''
   Many of the fathers, who include diplomats and businessmen, used
to spend the evenings at the casino. Now they offer assistance to
the Kuwaiti Embassy in Geneva and drink tea together while watching
nightly television news reports.
   The youths said a return to Kuwait now would be dangerous,
possibly even fatal, but they all said they would not have fled if
they had been home when the invasion occurred. Most have relatives
left behind.
   For Haifaa, a 21-year-old Kuwaiti university student, picking up
her brother and cousins at school is the main daily activity. She
finds the waiting intolerable.
   ``I would rather go back to Kuwait to be with my other brothers
and sisters and die than be separated like this,'' she said.
   School officials have gone out of their way to accommodate the
Kuwaitis, whose children speak Arabic and English, not French. No
tuition is charged, and alternative meals are offered on days when
the French students are fed pork, which is taboo for Moslems.
   One Western custom has not been modified: co-ed classes. Dalal
said she didn't mind her first exposure to male classmates. But one
14-year-old Kuwaiti boy, Sabih, complained about girls in his
class.
   The director of the secondary school, Chantal Daux, said she
initially suggested that multilingual private schools in Geneva
would be more suitable.
   But the parents insisted on the Divonne-les-Bains schools,
apparently mindful of $10,000 annual tuition at the private
schools.
   ``The parents expect us to teach the children French, discipline
and the European way of life,'' Ms. Daux said. ``Our goal is to
help them adapt smoothly ... without pampering them in a gilded
ghetto.''
   A additional English-speaking teacher has been hired to assist
the children in special language courses aimed at preparing them to
do all their studies in French as soon as possible.
   Ms. Daux said she never questioned the importance of welcoming
the Kuwaitis into her school.
   ``It's a terrible human tragedy for anyone who loses his
roots,'' she said. ``I thought about the children and their
despair. I put myself in the place of their mothers and did what I
would want done for my children.''

<HEAD>New Transcript Reveals Senator's Early Vietnam Frustration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1965, the year that U.S. forces in Vietnam
grew from 23,300 to 184,300 troops, Sen. J. William Fulbright
complained bitterly in private that the Johnson administration had
misled him about the war's progress, according to newly
declassified documents.
   Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara had testified in 1964 that
the Americans could get out of Vietnam by April 1965, and
Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told
fellow senators on July 23 that he had allowed himself to be taken
in.
   ``I think maybe we have been too easy on McNamara and some of
those in the years gone by, in accepting their optimistic
statement. ... I did not know enough to say, `Why you are a bloody
fool, this is absolute nonsense,''' Fulbright said at a closed-door
hearing of the committee. ``I just did not know enough.
   ``He (McNamara) said it and he has been out there,'' Fulbright
continued. ``It was long after the fact that it began to be
apparent that they had utterly misjudged the seriousness and the
character of the whole thing.''
   Fulbright's frustration comes to light in transcripts of the
committee's closed hearings in 1965. Released Saturday by the
panel, the transcripts provide a footnote to the history of that
period.
   Fulbright, an Arkansas Democrat, is now a Washington attorney.
Attempts to reach him by telephone on Saturday were unsuccessful.
   Fulbright, later to become one of the Senate's foremost critics
of President Lyndon Johnson's war policies, was playing the role of
a reluctant supporter.
   But in an interview with The Associated Press on April 12, 1965,
he called for a temporary halt in bombing raids on North Vietnam as
a spur to peace talks.
   Secretary of State Dean Rusk replied that such an act ``would
only encourage the aggressor.'' And Johnson, reacting to Fulbright,
said that until the independence of South Vietnam was guaranteed
``there is no human power capable of forcing us from Vietnam.''
   Three years later, on March 31, 1968, Johnson went before a
nationwide television audience to announce a unilateral halt of the
bombardment of North Vietnam and his own decision not to seek
re-election. Three days later, North Vietnam agreed to open
negotiations in Paris.
   The United States withdrew from Vietnam in 1973 and the war
ended with the North Vietnamese capture of Saigon in 1975.
   In August 1964, the year before Fulbright's private
disenchantment, he steered through the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution
which Johnson used as the equivalent of a declaration of war.
   It passed the Senate 88-2 and the House 416-0 a few days after
two U.S. Navy vessels reported they had come under attack in the
Tonkin Gulf, off the coast of North Vietnam. The resolution
authorized Johnson to ``take all necessary measures to repel an
armed attack ... and to prevent further aggression.''
   Many times in the ensuing years, Fulbright expressed dismay that
he used his influence to help pass so open-ended a resolution.
   The transcript shows that as early as April 1965 Fulbright was
concerned about the way resolution was being used as a de facto
declaration of war.
   ``The existing mission, I thought, was a rather limited one,''
he told Rusk. ``But in effect, for all practical purposes, we arewaging
war on North Vietnam ... It would seem to me not out of
order if we are going to send 30,000, 50,000, 100,000 men, that the
Congress might have the say about it.''
   He added: ``The operation in Vietnam has obviously become quite
controversial. A lot of us have been quiet. We do not want to
embarrass the administration. We have not discussed it in public.''
   Rusk replied ``Well, Mr. Chairman, it is very hard to look into
the future to that extent...''
   ``We have the impression that Hanoi is not yet convinced that it
cannot win in the south. We also have the impression that they are
relying heavily on the buildup of international and domestic
opinion in this country to cause the United States to in some way
pull back from the situation.''

<HEAD>Jordan Fears It May Be First Casualty in Gulf Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As Iraq and its foes dig into the sand for
a long, hard war of nerves, leaders in Jordan fear their
once-thriving desert kingdom will be the first casualty.
   ``We could simply disappear,'' observed an influential banker,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. He recalled an old proverb:
When elephants fight, the grass gets trampled.
   Jordan was rocketed to prosperity by the Persian Gulf oil boom
in the 1970s. Amman joined chaotic Beirut as a regional capital.
But since 1985, regional recession has plunged Jordan into hard
times.
   Now, economists warn, the gulf crisis might deliver a fatal
blow. If it drags on for a year, Jordan could lose $2 billion. Its
annual budget is only $3.7 billion.
   Jordan and other countries in the gulf region will loose
billions of dollars worth of trade, service fees and worker
remittances as a result of the U.N.-imposed economic sanctions
against Iraq, and the crisis itself.
   Tourism, another source of income for Jordan, is also at a low.
At Petra, only the flutes of Bedouin children tending goats echo
off the ancient ruins that once attracted 1,000 foreign tourists a
day.
   ``This has gone beyond crisis,'' said Riad Khouri, a Jordanian
who directs Middle East Business Associates in Beirut. ``This is
catastrophe.''
   ``The future is a black abyss,'' one European diplomat put it.
``Jordan might get smothered by circumstances.''
   Saudi Arabia, a reliable if reluctant benefactor, has turned off
the tap. A foreign debt of $8.5 billion, rescheduled at great pain,
cannot be repaid.
   Even if foreign aid promised by the European Community and
Japan, among others, offsets some losses, the disrupted economy
threatens the livelihood of many Jordanians who now must compete
with the thousands who have come home from Iraq and Kuwait.
   In Amman, knots of Asian refugees huddle under trees on empty
lots, giving the flowered, comfortable capital an air of wartime
despondency.
   Everywhere, stalled construction projects leave the New
Hampshire-size nation of 3.1 million hanging somewhere between
biblical times and the space age.
   And economics is only part of it. Jordan's historic role as a
mediator among regional extremes is now in question.
   In the stormiest part of the political world, King Hussein's
Jordan has been the lightning rod. The country has bent in each
wind and sprung back to center. But this time, the winds may be too
strong.
   ``We're trying to maintain this position at the center,'' said a
senior Jordanian official, spreading his fingers in reflection.
``But it's true, this will be very difficult.''
   Western powers want Jordan to seal off Iraq and condemn Saddam
Hussein as an outlaw. Saddam wants his ally and trading partner to
help him evade what he calls anti-Arab sanctions.
   King Hussein is obliged to lean toward Iraq not only by the
strong popular support for Saddam within Jordan, but by the
Palestinians who straddle both banks of the Jordan River. His
position has angered Western allies.
   Israel regards Jordan as a potential corridor for invasion from
Iraq. Its right-wing government rejects negotiation with the
Palestinians over the Israeli-occupied territories.
   The economic and political strains promise only to worsen.
   Nearly 300,000 Jordanians work in the gulf, and possibly half of
them might return. Even in normal times, Jordan's population growth
rate of 4 percent is among the world's highest.
   Unemployment was already at 20 percent when Iraq invaded Kuwait
Aug. 2, and it could soon double. Inflation, now near 15 percent,
could also double if the Jordanian dinar loses more value.
   Food subsidies have been cut. The price of sugar tripled
overnight.
   Authorities fear crime will no longer be a rare phenomenon among
Jordanians, who are mostly devout Moslems.
   ``We're being flooded with people who've lost everything, and
desperate people cannot afford morality,'' said Sabri Rubeihat, a
police major who teaches sociology and criminology. ``This will be
very serious.''
   Developments so far have stung the royal family which, aides
say, feels it has been tragically misunderstood by its friends.
   Crown Prince Hassan, writing in the Washington Post, blamed
hostility in Washington on ``uninformed, naive'' American
columnists.
   He wrote: ``The shrieks of important media pundits have all too
often a distressing way of shaping public perceptions -
particularly in the United States, a country that Jordan has always
felt close to because of shared democratic and cultural values.
   ``We do not wish to lose the friendship and goodwill of
Americans, and especially not on account of impressions sustained
by malevolent editorializing.''
   But U.S. officials watch not only the newspapers but also food
and supplies slipping across the border to Iraq in defiance of the
U.N. economic sanctions. Public criticism has been muted, but U.S.
sources say they are concerned.
   One Jordanian political analyst, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, added his voice to a generally pessimistic mood.
   ``Jordan did not exist in 1920,'' he said. ``There is no reason
for it to exist in the year 2000.''

hitting the driver of the car in the head and killing him.
   Michael Polski, 71, of Millerstown was struck Friday afternoon,
said state police Trooper Richard Geedey. Polski's car then drifted

   At least 380 Ugandans have died during an
outbreak of meningitis, and a health worker predicted the death
toll may rise, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   New Vision newspaper, citing unidentified government officials,
said about 180 deaths occurred in the Moroto district, about 315
miles northeast of the capital city of Kampala.
   On Friday, a senior official in the Mbarara district, about 165
miles southwest of Kampala, said about 200 people had died in a
2-month-old outbreak.
   Meningitis, a viral disease that attacks the brain and spinal
cord, can be fatal if not treated early.
   Andrew Lobur, a health worker in a Moroto dispensary, said the
toll could rise. ``Many others are still dying in far away villages
where they could not reach the dispensary or health centers,'' he
was quoted as saying.
   Henry Rwigymera, Mbarara district administrator, said Uganda's
stocks of anti-meningitis drugs were exhausted. New supplies are
expected next week.

   Five floors under the streets of
this desert capital lies the ``War Room'' where U.S. and Saudi
officers plan strategy for the troops, tanks and aircraft hundreds
of miles to the north.
   The emphasis is on equal partnership as top officers gather
behind the vault-like doors twice a day for briefings on the latest
situation in the confrontation with Iraq.
   Officials familiar with the workings of the top-secret command
post say the operation's joint nature is intended to keep the
massive U.S. military force from overwhelming the Saudis in their
own country.
   U.S. officers acknowledge that the lines of command authority
often appear fuzzy, but insist there is no major conflict over who
is in charge.
   Two Associated Press journalists were granted access to the
command post on condition they did not name any officers or reveal
the location of the center.
   In interviews, U.S. and Saudi officers agreed the system has
worked relatively smoothly.
   ``Decisions can be taken jointly and then communicated to the
separate command lines in the field,'' said a senior U.S. officer,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   But he noted his Saudi counterpart at the center is free to
issue orders to American officers.
   Even the name of the underground bunker is meant to symbolize
harmony: the Coalition, Coordination, Communications and
Integration Center, or CCCIC, which is based on NATO and other
integrated military headquarters.
   ``We've taken pieces of experiences elsewhere and put them
together. The pieces - intelligence, operations, air, surface,
naval - are all pretty standard. How we've glued them together is
what's different,'' the senior officer explained.
   The center, set up in the early days of Operation Desert Shield
and still being assembled, is run by two major generals - one
American and one Saudi - who sit at adjoining desks.
   The rest of the large, high-ceilinged room is taken up with
groupings of desks for separate air, land and sea operations.
   Officers, mostly colonels and majors from the two countries,
work side by side to collect and analyze information from the
field.
   ``We try to keep the ranks as even as we can,'' said a U.S.
officer.
   Business is conducted in English, since few of the Americans are
proficient in Arabic. Many of the Saudi officers trained in the
United States or Britain.
   The U.S. general heading the American side is a veteran of
service in Saudi Arabia. His Saudi counterpart wears a graduate's
ring from the U.S. Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pa.
   ``Some of us have a cultural awareness, but even though we know
each other, we're very conscious of the difference. We don't
dominate, we specifically try to balance things,'' said one U.S.
officer.
   At the field command level, U.S. officers maintain control over
their own troops. The Saudis lead their units, as well as the
Egyptian, Syrian, Moroccan, and other Arab forces.
   Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the U.S. forces in
Saudi Arabia, and his counterpart Prince Khaled Bin Sultan, the
Saudi Chief of Staff, are frequent visitors to the command center.
   But in the event of war, they would ``move around, stay
flexible'' because they can be in instant touch with the command
center from anywhere, the senior officer said.
   Should fighting actually break out, he said, there would be
``some sort of early warning. The Iraqis could not take us by
surprise. Then there would be a focused integrated defense plan
bringing all the U.S. and Islamic forces together.''

   A 16-year-old dropout tattooed with white
supremacy slogans has been accused of killing a 59-year-old black
woman, allegedly because she pulled away from a stop sign too
slowly for his taste.
   Chad Sullivan, 16, who had been kicked out of his grandmother's
house two weeks ago, was booked Friday on a charge of murder in the
death of Dorothy Mae Gourrier, police said.
   Police speculated that the killing was racially motivated.
Sullivan was tattooed with white supremacy and satanist slogans,
police said.
   The walls of an apartment where Sullivan recently had stayed
were covered with slurs against blacks, Jews and police, according
to police and the apartment's owner.
   An Orleans Parish Juvenile Court judge is to decide Monday
whether Sullivan should stand trial as an adult.
   Mrs. Gourrier was shot Wednesday while driving in New Orleans.
   Sullivan had been arrested Thursday on a trespassing charge
after police caught him swimming in a canal.
   The Times-Picayune quoted an unidentified source Saturday as
saying that one of Sullivan's friends called police Thursday and
said the youth had been bragging about killing Gourrier. Other
friends confirmed the report, the source told the newspaper.
   He also was booked on a charge of assault Thursday, after
Officer Earl Woolfolk, who is black, identified him as the person
who hit him with a beer bottle and broke his nose while he was
jogging Sept. 7.
   Police said they have not found the gun or the car from which
Mrs. Gourrier was shot.
   Sullivan's grandmother, Meldean Cowen, said she and her husband,
Everett, kicked Sullivan out of their home about two weeks ago,
after he took her car without permission and wrecked it.
   ``My husband told him he couldn't live here anymore if he was
going to do things that way,'' Mrs. Cowen said. ``He had been going
in and out of the window. My husband and I are over 65 and we can't
handle that kind of behavior.''
   She said Sullivan had lived with them off and on for more than
two years, never staying more than a few weeks at a time, and had
dropped out of school in ninth grade. He no longer lives with his
mother in Metairie because of family problems, she said.
   ``He was in trouble all the time for one thing or another,'' she
said.
   Sullivan's mother, Karen Dussor, would not comment.
   ``The family has been struggling with this kid forever,'' said
his attorney, Alice Jacobs. ``I don't know if he's had a violent
crime up to now. Basically he's been joy-riding in cars.''

<TEXT>
   A man accused of gunning down two women
college workers in a drunken shooting spree in a campus cafeteria
has pleaded guilty to charges of murder and attempted murder.
   John W. Aills faces a maximum of 100 years in prison on each
count when he is sentenced Oct. 25. He also faces extradition on
another charge to South Carolina, where he could get the death
penalty.
   Aills originally pleaded innocent and indicated he would claim
the May 18 shootings at Carroll College, a small Roman Catholic
college in Helena, were a result of a mental disease or defect.
   But a series of psychological evaluations this summer failed to
support that defense, Lewis and Clark County Attorney Mike McGrath
said before Friday's hearing.
   Aills, 34, from Dayton, Ohio, said little in court other than to
acknowledge that he understood the charges against him and the
consequences of his guilty pleas to deliberate homicide and
attempted deliberate homicide.
   Asked about a possible motive, McGrath said Friday there
appeared to be none.
   ``What the record shows is that he was very drunk and very
mean,'' he said of Aills. ``He had a long history of alcoholism and
has had a gun fetish for a long time.''
   Security was tight for the hearing because authorities had
received several death threats against Aills over the past two
weeks, said McGrath. He refused to elaborate.
   The court was filled with relatives of the victims.
   Defense attorney Nick Jacques said Aills did not remember
anything of the shootings. He said the guilty plea reflected Aills'
belief that the evidence against him would be enough for
convictions.
   McGrath recounted some details of the incident, noting that
there were witnesses and the murder weapon - a .44-caliber revolver
- was next to Aills when he was found hiding under a fir tree on
the campus shortly after the shootings.
   Aills, a former ranch hand but unemployed at the time of his
arrest, has been held without bail since his arrest for the murder
of Sharon Hance, 52, a Carroll College secretary, and the wounding
of Emma Peschke, 42, a food service worker. The two women were shot
while they sat with a group of college workers on their coffee
breaks.
   After his sentencing, he will be extradited to South Carolina
where he faces another murder charge in a 1987 stabbing. McGrath
noted that Aills could face the death penalty in that state.

<HEAD>NASA Counting Down for Tuesday Launch of Columbia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA's fourth countdown for Columbia
began Saturday as scientists prepared once again for the long
astronomy mission and tried to keep their excitement in check.
   Columbia has been grounded for 3{ months because of leaking
hydrogen. Officials will not know for sure whether all of the leaks
have been plugged until the shuttle is fueled for Tuesday's early
morning launch.
   ``This is the fourth countdown we're going through. We're
getting a little bit too used to it,'' said mission scientist Ted
Gull. ``But the nervousness of the first flight isn't there. We
know we're ready, and that's a very positive thing to say.''
   Since the last launch attempt 1{ weeks ago, NASA has replaced
two leaking components in Columbia's aft compartment. A new set of
recirculation pumps also was installed, but engineers later
determined there was nothing wrong with the ones that were removed.
   Hydrogen flooded Columbia's aft compartment during fueling for
the Sept. 6 launch attempt. But no leaks were detected around new
fuel lines between the orbiter and external tank, the site of
extensive leaking during fueling for the first launch attempt in
late May.
   Columbia's second countdown was halted late last month after
communication with one of four telescopes aboard the shuttle was
disrupted. The telescopes constitute a $150 million observatory
called Astro that will probe ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted
from some of the hottest objects in the universe.
   Gull and other scientists have had to revise Astro's observing
schedule after each launch delay. The mission originally was
scheduled for March 1986, but was put on indefinite hold when
Challenger exploded earlier that year.
   Only three or four targets were lost as a result of the latest
12-day postponement, Gull said. Among the more than 260 objects
Astro is set to observe are a comet making its first recorded pass
through the solar system, a supernova and Jupiter.
   Four astronomers who are part of Columbia's seven-man crew will
operate Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes round-the-clock. The
X-ray telescope will be managed by computer commands sent from the
ground.
   The observatory will remain in the shuttle's cargo bay
throughout the nine-to-10-day mission, the first in five years
devoted entirely to scientific research.
   ``There's guarded excitement,'' Gull said. ``I think it's about
time. Astro deserves success. NASA deserves a success, too.''
   NASA has not launched a shuttle since April, when Discovery
carried the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. Two months later,
the $1.5 billion telescope was found to have a badly flawed mirror
that blurs images.
   Launch director Bob Sieck said Columbia will have two chances to
lift off - Tuesday and Wednesday. If it isn't launched by then, its
mission will be postponed until after Discovery's October mission
to deploy a sun-probing satellite.
   Discovery must lift off by Oct. 23 or wait until late 1991 when
Earth is in proper alignment again with the sun and Jupiter. The
satellite, called Ulysses, needs Jupiter's gravity to achieve the
right solar orbit.
   Gull already is mapping out an observing schedule for November
in case Columbia does not get off the ground this week.
   ``We're trying to hedge our bets,'' he said.

<HEAD>Party Chairman Praises Bush Gulf Strategy, Attacks GOP Domestic
Stands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Democratic Party offered a
preview Saturday of his strategy for the 1990 elections: full
support for President Bush on the Persian Gulf coupled with an
all-out attack on Republican domestic policies.
   ``Saddam Hussein will get no mixed signals from America or from
this party,'' Ronald H. Brown told a meeting of the Democratic
National Committee.
   He declared that the opposition party ``stands behind our
president as he acts to roll back Iraq's blatant aggression.''
   But Brown made clear where partisan politics begins.
   ``We'll stand up to Saddam Hussein,'' he said ``but we won't
stand by as the new Republican recession wreaks havoc on our
economy.''
   The closest Brown and his fellow Democrats came to criticizing
the Republican president on the Middle East was to denounce Bush
and Ronald Reagan for failing to have an energy policy that would
make the nation less dependent on imported oil.
   On domestic issues, Brown pulled no punches. He hammered at Bush
for proposing ``massive tax cuts for America's plutocrats'' and he
blamed the Republicans for the savings and loan crisis.
   ``We're in the fall campaign for real and we Democrats are
running hard,'' Brown told the DNC.
   His speech reflected the election-year dilemma created by Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the Bush administration's military
response.
   On the one hand, the Democrats feel they have no choice but to
back the president at a time when American troops are confronting a
hostile force overseas.
   At the same time, the Persian Gulf crisis has made it difficult
for the Democrats to get voters to pay attention to issues on which
the Republicans looked vulnerable before the invasion.
   ``People are angry,'' about the S&amp;L scandals, said Ohio
Democratic chairman Jim Ruvolo. ``And they blame Republicans more
than Democrats.''
   ``But now that's faded into the background,'' he added.
``There's this big screen between voters and information and that
screen is Iraq.''
   The two-day Democratic Party meeting was remarkably free of the
internal bickering has characterized such sessions in past years,
which was just what Brown had hoped for.
   The Democrats adopted the formal call for their 1992 nominating
convention, including the rules which will determine how more than
4,000 delegtes will be allocated among the states and territories.
   The precise allocations won't be known until after the 1990
Census and the shift in congressional seats. California will have
the largest convention delegation and its share of the total will
increase dramatically. Preliminary Census figures show California
likely to gain seven new House seats.
   In the past, bitter fights have been waged around such arcane
matters as the wording of the call, but this time it passed without
debate or a dissenting vote.
   The Democrats also adopted resolutions criticizing the
Republicans for lacking an energy policy and urging the president
to sign legislation now moving through the Democratic-controlled
Congress that would strengthen laws barring discrimination in the
workplace.
   Bush has threatened to veto the legislation on the grounds it
would force businesses to adopt quotas and would promote increased
litigation.
   With Brown's strong backing, the Democrats tabled a resolution
that would have urged budget negotiators to ``reject new taxes as a
way to balance the Bush federal budget.''

   University of Florida senior Jodie
Spencer has been commuting 60 miles home to Jacksonville ever since
the bodies of five students were found in off-campus apartments.
   ``I'm terrified,'' said Miss Spencer. ``I have an apartment
here, but I haven't spent one night here (since Aug. 28) and I will
not until someone is arrested.''
   This college town has been reeling since the discovery of five
murdered students, three of them mutilated, including one who was
decapitated. Hundreds of students fled the campus on Labor Day
weekend.
   The fact that the most-publicized suspect, Edward Lewis
Humphrey, 18, is in jail on unrelated charges has caused some
students to let down their guard but has not eased the tension for
many others. Humphrey, a University of Florida freshman with a
fondness for military fantasy and knives, has not been charged in
the slayings.
   ``I'm not back to normal even though I think everyone else is,''
Miss Spencer said. ``The severity of the mutilation is what bothers
me.''
   University officials said an estimated 500 students have
withdrawn from school as a result of the slayings, which occurred
as fall classes were starting.
   Michelle Hager, a 20-year-old junior from Miami, says she's
concerned that many students are neglecting their own safety now
that three weeks have passed.
   ``Students are pretty much back in the swing of things, but many
are starting to slack off,'' she said. Some of her friends are even
walking alone at night, she said.
   ``Most people think it is Humphrey,'' she said.
   Humphrey is being held in lieu of $1.1 million bond in Brevard
County. He has been charged with beating his 79-year-old
grandmother at their home in Indialantic, about 180 miles away. He
also faces warrants in an Aug. 25 assault on two male University of
Florida students and an October 1988 armed burglary and attempted
rape in Indian River County.
   The only other suspect whose name has been disclosed, Stephen
Bates, 30, also is jailed on unrelated charges, in the Polk County
Jail in Bartow.
   While most of the public attention has focused on Humphrey,
search of Bates' Lakeland home has turned up a hangman's noose,
personal satanic writings and books on satanism and Jack the
Ripper, The Lakeland Ledger reported Saturday.
   Police have said there are eight suspects.
   ``I think a lot of people are letting down their guard because
they think Edward Humphrey is the guy, but I think the attacker is
still out there,'' said Desiree Mooney, 22, a senior from West Palm
Beach.
   Debbie Rohlfing, 20, a senior from Montclair, Va., lives in the
Hawaiian Village Apartments, where Humphrey also had an apartment.
She never met him.
   ``I think a lot of people are trying to get on with their lives,
but some students are still paranoid,'' she said. She said she is
acting as if the killer is loose, and added, ``People are being
real careful.''
   Danny Grissom, 22, a senior from Miami, said he and his roommate
had taken precautions against attack.
   ``My roommate has a gun and I have a knife,'' he said. ``I feel
safe, but even now I feel you have to be careful.''
   Police said they've seen a noticeable decline in tension.
   ``Things are calming down and leveling off,'' said police Lt.
Sadie Darnell, who added that extra patrols around apartment
complexes are continuing.
   A dramatic jump in the number of calls to police was reported
the week after the slayings. Calls to the 911 emergency number were
up 81 percent, and calls to the main police telephone number jumped
557 percent.
   Calls are still more frequent than normal but are decreasing,
Ms. Darnell said.
   Media attention also has dwindled, but the killings are never
far from the consciousness of University of Florida students.
   Christopher Cairns, a 25-year-old engineering student, said
business has picked up in the pub where he works. Immediately after
the killings, no one came in at night.
   ``I'm more relaxed, but still cautious,'' he said. ``That's how
I am and I perceive others to be.''

<HEAD>Analysts Say Saddam's High Command Is Weak Link In Iraqi Military</HEAD>

   Should war break out in the Persian Gulf,
the weak link in Iraq's formidable, combat-seasoned military
machine could well be Saddam Hussein's high command, military
analysts say.
   His tightly centralized chain of command allows field commanders
little tactical initiative, a factor that frequently cost the
Iraqis dearly in the 1980-88 war with Iran.
   Analysts say that Saddam's 1 million-man military, the fourth
biggest in the world after the United States, the Soviet Union and
China, is led by men promoted because of loyalty rather than
professional skills.
   ``He surrounds himself with people who have very little
operational ability,'' said Bernard Trainor, a former U.S. Marine
general who has visited Iraq several times. ``Their job is to keep
the boss placated. They'll even allow casualties in the field to do
that.''
   ``The problem for Saddam is that when you're in that kind of
environment, told only what you want to hear, you lose your
perspective and the ability to act decisively and quickly,'' said
Trainor, who heads the national security program at Harvard's John
F. Kennedy School of Government. He spoke in a telephone interview
from Boston.
   Zeev Eytan, a former Israeli Army colonel who is now an analyst
with the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Jerusalem, noted:
``Saddam controls all military affairs, so it's safe to assume that
corps and divisional commanders will do only what they are ordered
to do.''
   Eytan and others believe that the tight rein Saddam keeps on his
commanders inhibits their ability to conduct effective rapid
maneuvers.
   ``In the Gulf war, the Iraqis performed better in defense than
in offense. They did well in offensive operations only when their
missions had been well rehearsed,'' Eytan said.
   As a civilian strategist with no formal military training,
Saddam ``is reminiscent of Hitler,'' Eytan said in a telephone
interview.
   ``Hitler always intervened in high strategy, often disastrously.
He trusted his own intuition more than the advice of the
professionals around him,'' he noted.
   ``Perhaps after fighting for eight years against Iran Saddam has
acquired some grasp of military strategy,'' Eytan said.
   Many analysts don't think so.
   Saddam invaded Iran in September 1980 expecting a quick victory.
Instead, he triggered the longest conventional war this century,
one that caused a million casualties - by conservative estimates.
   Saddam's inner circle of military advisers are Air Marshal Hamid
Shaaban, 59, who commanded the air force until last year and is now
an adviser to Saddam; Gen. Abdel-Jaber Khalil Shansal, the
70-year-old defense minister and former Chief of Staff; and Brig.
Gen. Hussein Kamel, 50, the Minister of Industry and Military
Industrialization.
   The current Chief of Staff is Lt. Gen. Nizar Abdul-Karim
al-Khazraji, a corps commander during the Persian Gulf war.
   Shaaban and Kamel, who is Saddam's cousin and son-in-law, are
both members of his clan from Takrit, his hometown in northern
Iraq. Kamel is widely considered to be the rising star in Baghdad
and a possible successor to Saddam.
   Shansal was made defense minister after Gen. Adnan Khairallah,
Saddam's cousin and brother-in-law who held the post throughout the
war, died in a mysterious helicopter crash in 1989.
   The Iraqis said the helicopter went down in a sandstorm. But
word was Khairallah had been feuding with Saddam.
   Since he took power in 1979, Saddam has made sure that the
military has been put under the complete control of the ruling
Baath Party, the only political organization military men can
belong to.
   The army is riddled with informers from Saddam's security
apparatus. All senior military posts are held by Baathists and
there are party cadres assigned to all heaquarters down to
battalion level.
   ``Saddam doesn't trust the army. It's the only institution that
could threaten him,'' said Trainor.
   Eytan said Saddam constantly shuffles commanders around to
prevent any of them from establishing a power base. He regularly
purges the military, particularly of important officers or war
heroes whose popularity he perceives as a threat.
   ``This discourages initiative in the officer corps,'' said
Eytan. ``Everyone's very careful in Iraq.''
   Diplomats in Baghdad have recently reported signs of unrest in
the officer corps. Unconfirmed reports have said as many as 120
officers have been executed for opposing the invasion of Kuwait.
   It's not clear how the army views Saddam's decision to throw in
the towel with Iran last month, relinquishing all territory seized
in the war and giving Tehran sovereignty over the eastern half of
the Shatt-al-Arab waterway.
   Saddam did that to secure his eastern border with Iran while he
was locked in the escalating confrontation with the United States.
   ``It must have been a bitter pill for the army to swallow. They
must have wondered what the hell they fought the Iranians for eight
years for,'' said Hans-Heino Kopietz, a Middle East specialist
until recently with London's International Institute for Strategic
Studies.

<HEAD>Military Worries About Impact of Lengthy U.S. Deployment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The likelihood of a lengthy U.S.
military deployment in Saudi Arabia is fostering nervousness among
commanders, who doubt diplomacy will resolve the crisis and think
time may be on Saddam Hussein's side.
   Apprehensions became apparent over the last week that a long
wait in the desert could try the patience of Saudi hosts, hurt
soldiers' morale and make a scapegoat of the U.S. military.
   As the feeling that war with Iraq is inevitable has given way to
uncertainty, discontent has surfaced among U.S. troops. Complaints
have flowed from both Americans and Saudis about the cultural
strains caused by the U.S. presence.
   Despite public statements to the contrary, top U.S. officers in
Saudi Arabia are increasingly saying in private that time is more
an enemy of the United States and Saudi Arabia than of Saddam.
   While the final decision may be out of their hands, U.S.
commanders are engaged in a debate over whether to push for a
deadline after which force would be used.
   Saudi leaders clearly oppose a long deployment.
   ``Six months will be pushing it,'' a Saudi diplomatic official
said recently in a private discussion. ``Our society will not be
able to take more than that. If there's no war by then, we'll start
one for you.''
   A Saudi government official in oil-rich Eastern Province, where
most U.S. troops are settling in, said: ``There's a big group of
people out there who wish to see a military action quickly.''
   For now, diplomacy must be given a chance, U.S. commanders say.
Some hold out slim hopes a resolution will be reached; in any case,
the United States needs 6-10 weeks to complete its military
buildup.
   Gen. Michael Dugan, the Air Force chief of staff, said the two
possible courses of action now were ``patience and sweat or ...
violence and blood.''
   Dugan endorsed patience. But he acknowledged ``if there's any
culture in the world that's impatient it's mine, it's the United
States.''
   ``By late October we're going to be faced with a fundamental
decision,'' said a ranking officer, speaking on condition he not be
named. ``Did we come here to sit and watch and wait, or did we come
here to put Saddam Hussein in his place? We're going to need a
clear mission or we're going to be in big trouble.''
   The prospect of waiting much past the end of October alarms
military commanders.
   Politically, they fear that Arab support, even Saudi support,
for the deployment might begin to waver. A greater worry is that
the American public's support might begin to erode.
   ``I'm not sure the American people will be with us for the long
haul,'' a senior officer said during a visit to Saudi Arabia last
week. ``There's great support now, but it's an uneasy support and
could disappear quickly.''
   He said he believed the Helsinki summit between President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ended with a gentleman's
agreement to give Moscow, for years a close Iraqi ally, time to
attempt a ``backdoor'' diplomatic solution.
   ``My understanding is that in exchange, we asked the Soviets to
be supportive, or at least understanding, if it came down to
military action,'' he said.
   But another official on that trip said it was highly unlikely
the United States would ever take unilateral military action
against Iraq.
   ``If the world's support collapses and it's us against Saddam,
the military will be set up to take the fall. That's what a lot of
us are worrying about,'' the official said.
   Evidence is mounting that neither commanders nor their troops
particularly like it in Saudi Arabia, with its harsh desert
conditions far from home and rigid social customs, particularly
attitudes toward women.
   At each base camp he visited last week, Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked by soldiers
when they could go home. At one point a Saudi officer ran up to a
U.S. commander and demanded that U.S. servicewomen be sent home.
   ``Every day we're running into a new aspect of cultural
differences,'' the U.S. commander, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, said
in an interview. ``There's no magic solution.''
   Powell suggested Thursday that rotations are planned to give the
troops stationed in Saudi Arabia a break.
   But many units have brought most of their men and assets with
them, leaving little leeway for rotations.
   ``When the enthusiasm starts to wane, and there are signs that
it is already, we'll face some morale challenges,'' an Army general
said. ``It's my biggest worry right now, but I don't have any
answers.''

<TEXT>
   If visitors to the Evansville Museum's
earthquake exhibit aren't all shaken up, they're certainly
attentive - particularly since a scientist has predicted a quake
could hit the area this December.
   ``A lot of times people walk through exhibits, nod their heads
and walk out. This one they pay attention to,'' said Mitchell
Luman, the museum's science director.
   New Mexico climatologist Iben Browning, who believes quakes can
be triggered by tidal forces putting stress on earthquake faults,
has estimated that a major quake could strike the Midwest on Dec. 2
or 3.
   Although many earthquake specialists scoff at the notion, they
say there is no doubt there will be a major quake along the New
Madrid fault eventually.
   ``We tell people it's not necessarily going to appen in
December, but it is going to happen,'' Luman said. ``We tell people
to be prepared all the time.''
   The temporary exhibit, sponsored by the Independent Insurance
Agents of Evansville, was planned three years ago, long before
Browning's prediction caused a sensation, Luman said.
   But the museum welcomes the attention. The ``Shake, Rattle and
Roll'' display, which includes a seismograph, fault-line maps and
safety tips, has been extended two months until Dec. 16 because of
its popularity.
   About 16,000 people have visited the museum since the display
opened July 8, Luman said. He said there was no way to know how
many were attracted by the earthquake information, which uses about
10 percent of the museum's space.
   But it's obvious that the display is causing a stir.
   ``People spend two to four times as long in here as they do in
other exhibits in this space,'' Luman said. ``They're really
serious and engaged by what they see here.''
   Maps show the location of the New Madrid fault system, which
reaches through Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee and Arkansas.
Paducah, Ky., is just 30 miles from its northern end. Memphis,
Tenn., lies 25 miles from the southern end.
   In 1811 and 1812, a series of violent quakes centered in New
Madrid, Mo., were felt across much of the eastern United States.
They have been estimated at around 8 on the Richter scale - far
higher, for example, than last year's San Francisco area quake.
   There is a 50 percent chance that the area around the New Madrid
fault will be hit by an earthquake of at least 6.0 on the Richter
scale within the next 10 years, Luman said. There is a 90 percent
chance of such a quake within the next 50 years, he said.
   The museum quotes a Federal Emergency Management Agency study
that says a major New Madrid earthquake, 7.6 on the Richter scale,
would kill 227 people in the Evansville area if it hit during a
school day. More than 1,000 people would be injured and 11,000
would have to leave their homes, the study predicts.
   Nevertheless, Luman said, the museum tried to get its safety
message across while keeping the exhibit's tone light.
   ``It's not doom and gloom. We're not trying to get too
serious,'' Luman said. ``That's why the title is ``Shake, Rattle
and Roll.'' It's not ``Live Now, Die Later.''
   Visitors walk through a three-room model of a house where the
safest areas to go during a quake are marked off. Those include
doorways and underneath strong tables. The exhibit also shows how
to make homes safer in case of a quake.
   A quake's destructive potential was not lost on 8-year-old Zach
Fussner of Newburgh, who recently viewed the museum's photographs
of the Oct. 17 San Francisco earthquake with his mother.
   ``What's scary about it is am I going to live or what?'' he
said. ``What if I die? My house might fall on me.''
   Zach said he felt better, however, knowing he should be safer
hiding under his desk if a quake strikes.

<HEAD>Magellan Bounces Radar Off Venus as Picture-Making Resumes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Magellan spacecraft bounced radar
off Venus today, trying to make maps of the cloud-covered planet
for the first time since the probe was plagued by communications
blackouts a month ago.
   ``We're mapping!'' said Jim Scott, Magellan mission director at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. ``Most people are sighing with relief.''
   Magellan started bouncing radar waves off the cloud-covered
planet at 9:16 a.m. PDT, he said. The spacecraft is designed to
collect the echoes, then send the information to Earth, where they
will be assembled into maps and pictures.
   Confirmation that the radar echoes were collected properly and
would result in good pictures was expected later today, Scott said,
adding the pictures should be released publicly sometime next week.
   Engineers lost radio contact with Magellan for 14 hours starting
Aug. 16, then for 17{ hours beginning Aug. 21.
   They still haven't learned the cause of the temporary blackouts,
which they have said could happen again. But they gave Magellan new
computer instructions so it can recover quickly from future
communications breakdowns.
   Magellan's $744 million mission is designed to produce the most
detailed pictures yet of Venus' surface, concealed beneath dense
clouds, as well as a global map of the planet.
   The craft was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989, and started orbiting Venus on Aug. 10.

<TEXT>
   Egypt, intensifying its campaign against
Iraq, said Saturday it has restricted the entry of Iraqis and
citizens of countries that support Baghdad and prohibited
politicans and journalists from attending a pro-Iraq conference.
   A senior security officer said the curbs apply to Jordanians,
Yemenis, Palestinians and Kuwaitis.
   Previously, citizens of those countries could get six-month
visas automatically on arrival in Egypt, like nationals of other
Arab countries.
   Egypt strongly opposed Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait. The Palestine Liberation Organization has backed Saddam,
while Jordan and Yemen have been generally sympathetic to him.
   Under the new regulations, the length of stay in Egypt will be
set by entry visas, depending on an applicant's business in the
country.
   The security officer, who spoke on condition he not be named,
said the aim of the controls regarding Kuwaitis was to prevent Iraq
from sending agents into Egypt with Kuwaiti passports.
   ``All government departments in Kuwait fell into Iraqi hands
after the invasion,'' he said. ``We are afraid that Iraq might try
to send Iraqis or non-Kuwaitis into Egypt with what might appear to
be genuine Kuwaiti passports.''
   In a related move, President Hosni Mubarak's government
prevented two Egyptian politicians - Ibrahim Shukry, chairman of
the left-of-center Socialist Labor Party, and Mohammed Hamed
Abul-Nasr of the fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood - from traveling
to Jordan for a pro-Saddam conference.
   Two journalists of the leftist National Unionist Progressive
Party also said they were not allowed to go.
   Participants at the conference planned to draw up an Arab peace
plan they would propose as an alternative to the multinational
force opposing Baghdad.

   Police on Saturday announced
``iron fist'' measures intended to halt savage street fighting that
has killed almost 800 blacks. But the African National Congress
called them too little, too late.
   The measures include curfews, roadblocks and the deployment of
more police and soldiers in black townships plagued by almost five
weeks of violence, Maj. Gen. Gerrit Erasmus told a news conference.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela has repeatedly called for stronger
government action, including use of the military, to quell the
unrest.
   After meeting Friday with President F.W. de Klerk, Mandela
accused the government of instigating the fighting and warned of
civil war if it continued.
   ``Mr. Mandela wants an iron fist - we will give an iron fist,''
Erasmus said Saturday. ``Iron Fist'' is the operation's code name.
   He said razor wire would be placed around migrant worker hostels
and squatter camps, flashpoints for much of the fighting. Anyone
entering or leaving the compounds would be searched for weapons,
Erasmus said.
   Police vehicles would have machine guns installed on top to
protect officers from attacks by blacks with assault rifles, the
official said. Police patrols already carry sub-machine guns in
addition to shotguns.
   The government last month sent police and army reinforcements
into the townships and imposed emergency regulations. But the
violence raged on and has spread into Johannesburg itself.
   Almost all the fighting occurs at night, when there are
virtually no police patrols in the townships. The main combatants
are Zulus loyal to the conservative Inkatha movement and Xhosas and
other blacks who support Mandela's ANC.
   Police said Saturday the townships were quiet. However,
Associated Press staffers witnessed an unarmed black being stoned,
stabbed and then burned to death at a train station in Soweto on
Saturday morning. The attackers said they were supporters of the
ANC and the victim was a Zulu who backed Inkatha.
   Mandela told a news conference later Saturday he believed the
new police measures would be ``totally ineffective.''
   He noted more than 700 blacks had been killed in the fighting
since Aug. 12, but the new measures came after attacks in recent
days that killed several police officers, including two whites.
   ``If these two policemen had not died, I can assure you, the
government would not have come out with these measure,'' Mandela
said.
   ``It looks like the government is arming itself to deal with the
liberation movement,'' he said, adding that other countries used
water cannon and tear gas, not live ammunition, to control crowds.
   Asked who he thought was behind recent attacks on blacks in
train stations and townships, Mandela said ``certain state
agencies'' were involved. ``The security forces are suspect,'' he
said.
   He gave no indication the ANC intends to reverse its decision
last month to suspend its 29-year armed struggle against the
government. But he said people have the right to be armed to defend
themselves in their homes.
   Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said Saturday he believes
the primary cause of the violence is the ``ANC's decades-long calls
on South Africans to kill for political purposes.''
   The ANC and Inkatha, the two main black opposition groups, blame
each other for the violence. Both oppose apartheid but differ over
tactics and plans for a future South Africa.
   Black leaders also have charged that a secret ``third party'' -
possibly right-wing whites - has taken part in attacks on blacks.
   Right-wing whites have rejected de Klerk's reform efforts and
threatened armed struggle against attempts to end white domination
in South Africa.
   De Klerk said Friday that unidentified groups were attempting to
sabotage government efforts to end apartheid and draw up a new
constitution free of racial discrimination.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Man's Bid To Freeze Head Before Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge rejected a mathematician's
bid to have his head frozen before he dies so that future
scientists can find a way to cure a malignant brain tumor and
attach his head to a healthy body.
   Superior Court Judge Ronald Stevens dismissed a petition Friday
by Thomas Donaldson for the right to have cryonics technicians
freeze his head before he is pronounced legally dead.
   Stevens said the courts have allowed the terminally ill to
refuse medical treatment. But it would mark a ``giant step'' to
allow others to freeze Donaldson before he is declared dead, the
judge ruled.
   Assistant Attorney General Kristofer Jorstad said Donaldson can
``put a bullet into his own heart. ... But he can't have people
associated with cryonics put that bullet into his heart. That's
murder one.''
   Donaldson, 46, of Sunnyvale, says he wants his head quick-frozen
using a process known as cryonic suspension. The procedure is
allowed after death from natural causes. But Donaldson contends
that if he waits until then, ``there would be no point in being
revived.''
   ``Under the current, stupid criteria, my brain could be entirely
destroyed before I'm declared dead,'' said Donaldson, a computer
consultant to Silicon Valley companies. ``That's why I filed the
lawsuit.''
   Donaldson said his tumor cannot be surgically removed and has
not responded to chemotherapy. According to court papers, it's
currently stable and he has a 40 percent chance of living until
August 1993.
   Donaldson has 30 days to amend his suit and resubmit it to the
judge. He said he would appeal if it is rejected again.
   ``If the case goes all the way to the Supreme Court and they
turn me down, I'll just starve myself to death. Then I can be
frozen before my brain goes and no one can be prosecuted,'' he
said.
   Donaldson said he believes scientists eventually will be able to
safely remove the tumor, then use his cells to create another body.
   ``As I see it, this is the only alternative to death,'' he said.
``I know we don't have all the technology right now, but I think
it's entirely possible in the future.''

<TEXT>
   West Germany will provide more
than $2 billion in immediate support for the U.S.-led military
operations in the Gulf, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today.
   Kohl announced the figure of $2.1 billion after talks with U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III at the chancellor's home in
this town in the southwest of the country.
   The United States has been pressing West Germany, its richest
European ally, to help meet the mounting costs of stationing some
150,000 troops in Saudi Arabia and participating in the naval
armada that is enforcing the U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq.
   Before the specific number was made public, Baker had told
reporters after a luncheon meeting with West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher that, ``We're very pleased with the
numbers that were presented at lunch.'' Baker had described them as
``significant and substantial figures.''
   West Germany had been sharply criticized in the United States
for the small size of its assistance thus far.
   Genscher said the West German government was determined to help
with the enforcement of U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
   Baker arrived in Bonn this afternoon on the most difficult stop
of his latest trip abroad. He was determined to overcome West
Germany's sluggish response to helping out in the campaign against
Iraq.
   Baker was bolstered in his talks in West Germany by separate
letters from the Pentagon and the State and Treasury departments
and a pledge from the Italian government of eight fighter planes
and a warship to join the international naval force in the Gulf.
   U.S. officials said the letters laid out the case for helping to
meet the mounting costs of the Gulf effort.
   Britain on Friday became the first European country to commit
ground forces to the Gulf, ordering an armored brigade of 6,000
troops and 120 tanks to Saudi Arabia. And Baker said in Rome that
Canada was sending forces to help prevent any additional actions by
Iraq, which invaded neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``All of this taken together, I think, can only send a very
clear signal that the international community is united in wanting
to see a reversal of this aggression,'' Baker said as he posed for
pictures with Italian President Francesco Cossiga.
   The West German Transport Ministry already has given the United
States a list of more than 50 merchant ships that could be used to
transport U.S. troops to the gulf. The United States also has made
contact with West German civilian airline companies to determine
whether planes could be chartered to ferry troops to the Middle
East.
   The West German government, however, says that it is up to the
individual companies to decide whether they wish to put the ships
and planes at American disposal.
   Baker last week raised $12 billion from Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates and the overthrown Kuwaiti regime.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad told Baker in Damascus on Friday
that he would send more troops to Saudi Arabia. Syria has sent
3,000 troops there already, and Western sources estimated Assad
might send as many as 15,000 more.
   Japan announced, meanwhile, that it would contribute $4 billion.
Other countries have offered lesser amounts or logistical support.
   But in the meantime, the situation appeared to worsen as Iraqi
soldiers swarmed the diplomatic compound of France, Canada and
Belgium on Friday in Kuwait.

   Three weeks after Iraq ordered
embassies in Kuwait to close their doors, governments around the
world are pondering the purpose of an embassy and the duty of a
diplomat.
   As of Saturday, 20 embassies - about one-third of the diplomatic
missions in the conquered emirate - were still defying the order to
shut down.
   In the sweltering heat of the Persian Gulf, the Iraqi occupiers
have steadily stepped up the pressure on the diplomats, surrounding
their missions with soldiers and cutting off water, electricity and
food supplies.
   Tensions reached a new high last week when Iraqi troops raided
the diplomatic compounds of France, Canada, Belgium and the
Netherlands and temporarily detained half a dozen diplomats.
   France announced Saturday it would dispatch 4,000 more soldiers
to the Persian Gulf and expel Iraqi military attaches in Paris in
response to the Iraqi raids.
   Six days after its Aug. 2 invasion, Iraq annexed Kuwait, and
subsequently told the embassies they had no further business in the
emirate. Kuwait was now an Iraqi state, Baghdad said, and diplomats
who chose to stay on would no longer have diplomatic immunity.
   That was a serious threat in a country where Western civilians
have been rounded up and taken to key installations to serve as
human shields against potential U.S. attack.
   Nations which have many citizens trapped in Kuwait have an
incentive to stay open as long as possible. But even those
diplomats who are doggedly remaining at their posts, behind locked
doors, with dwindling supplies and patchy communications, may no
longer be able to help anyone.
   Even so, the principle is important to many governments. They
believe closing down their embassies could be interpreted as tacit
recognition of the Iraqi rulers.
   The application of that principle has taken many forms.
   Some ambassadors have declared that their embassies remain open,
but have abandoned their compounds or flown home. At the Swiss
embassy, the flag is still flying - and the gardener is in charge.
   Finland and Turkey pulled their diplomats out of Kuwait early on
but said their empty embassies were symbolically open. The Soviet
Union evacuated all its citizens and closed the embassy, but said
it still maintains diplomatic relations with Kuwait.
   Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bjorn Blokhus said it was
not worth staying open once the risk to diplomats' safety became
too great. But the Norwegian ambassador, whose government ordered
him to leave last week, said he could have held out longer.
   One Western diplomat in Oslo suggested some envoys may have
their own reasons for facing down the Iraqi threat.
   ``Frankly, holding out for two weeks without food or water in
terrible heat is a great career booster,'' said the diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Some envoys, including Dutch Ambassador Joop Veling, have been
cautioned not to engage in any exaggerated heroics.
   But others, including the Egyptians, were told ``to hold out in
Kuwait as long as was humanly possible and until conditions became
impossible to endure,'' said a Foreign Ministry official in Cairo.
That point came last Thursday, when Egypt pulled out its staff.
   It is difficult for foreign ministry officials to assess misery
levels from thousands of miles away. The decision to evacuate is
usually taken in consultation with the diplomat in the field.
   But with telephone lines cut and generators that power shortwave
radios wearing down, communication is difficult.
   Even in embassies where living conditions have been tolerable,
the diplomats' lot has been difficult.
   ``The psychological stress is heavy. Life is monotonous. There
is always the chance for trouble,'' said Belgian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Johan Verbeke.
   At the U.S. Embassy, once a posh, palm-shaded compound, food is
reported to be scarce, or spoiling. The diplomats have boiled water
from the swimming pool to drink, burned furniture for cooking fuel,
and slept outside with the bugs to escape the heat.
   Still, Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell has been low-key about the
hardships. ``It isn't very pleasant,'' he said.

   American troops' presence in the Middle
East is causing shortages in this southern West Virginia town -
ribbon shortages.
   The Williamson City Council told City Clerk June Blevins to
decorate City Hall and a flag pole at the town fire station with
yellow bows and red, white and blue ribbon streamers to show
support for servicemen in the Middle East.
   Buying ribbon in Williamson, however, proved to be a difficult
assignment, Blevins told the City Counil on Thursday.
   Dozens of area residents have purchased ribbon for their own
displays, and hardly any stores in the Williamson area had ribbon
in stock, she said.
   Many homes, businesses, churches and other buildings throughout
the area sport yellow bows or colorful streamers.
   At least 14 soldiers from the Williamson area have been sent to
the Middle East since Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2,
officials said.
   Blevins said she made an arrangement of ribbons and bows for
City Hall. She has promised to make a better arrangement once more
ribbon becomes available.

   The Bush administration said Saturday it was
consulting with France and other allies on further possible steps
``to bring home to Iraq the cost of its aggression'' against three
embassies in Kuwait.
   Such steps, under discussion through the United Nations and in
President Bush's phone calls to world leaders, included tightening
the United Nations-passed economic sanctions, White House spokesman
Sean Walsh said.
   France on Saturday called for an emergency U.N. Security Council
meeting to condemn Iraq's invasion Friday of the embassies and to
expand the trade embargo against Iraq to include air traffic.
   France was expected to request a widening of the U.N. trade
embargo to block flights to Iraq and punish countries violating the
blockade, U.N. officials said.
   Walsh had no comment on the French initiative.
   The White House hailed France's dispatch of 4,000 additional
troops to the Persian Gulf and its expulsion of Iraqi military
attaches from Paris.
   French President Francois Mitterrand announced the steps
Saturday, a day after Iraqi troops stormed his country's diplomatic
compound in Kuwait and kidnapped four French citizens.
   ``We consider such steps appropriate and justified in view of
Iraq's continued infringement of diplomatic conventions covering
the presence of foreign embassies in Kuwait,'' a White House
statement said. ``We continue to consult with France and our other
friends on further possible steps to bring home to Iraq the cost of
its aggression, including tightening of the sanctions in all
possible ways.''
   Bush on Friday pledged to support Mitterrand in whatever he
decided to do in response to the violation of the embassy compound.
   The Iraqis released one French citizen, the country's military
attache, but three other French citizens remained hostages,
Mitterrand said Saturday. As a result, Mitterrand expelled Iraqi
military attaches from France and said other Iraqi diplomats would
be confined to Paris.
   Iraqi solders also invaded the embassies of Canada and Belgium
on Friday.
   They did not invade the U.S. Embassy, where Ambassador Nathaniel
Howell and a handful of aides held out despite a cutoff of
electricity and water.
   State Department spokesman Mark Dillon said Saturday that their
situation remained the same, and there had been no word of any
Iraqi moves on the U.S. compound, despite the continuing presence
of soldiers outside.
   The administration, meanwhile, prepared to submit to Congress a
request to sell Saudi Arabia $18 billion worth of weapons,
including F-15 fighter planes, tanks and other sophisticated arms,
according to an official.
   The administration has already proposed selling Saudi Arabia $3
billion in new weapons to bolster its defenses, including F-15
fighter planes, M-60 tanks, 15,000 rounds of armor-piercing
anti-tank ammunition and 200 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles.
   The official late Friday that the package was not yet finalized,
but would result from U.S. analysis of Saudi Arabia's military
needs to stand against a potential invasion threat from Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein.
   The expanded package has been under review, but ``no
recommendations have come to the White House,'' another
administration official said Saturday.
   The New York Times said in Saturday's editions that the new
package includes 24 additional F-15s, as many as 48 Apache
helicopters, 385 M-1A2 tanks, 400-500 M-2 Bradley personnel
carriers and thousands of trucks and jeeps.
   The Washington Post said the package would range from $18
billion to $23 billion and also would include Patriot air defense
systems, naval command and control systems and thousands of tons of
ammunition.

<HEAD>Four Former Followers of Bhagwan Charged With Conspiracy to Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four former disciples of the late Indian
guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh have been arrested and charged with
conspiracy to murder a federal prosecutor several years ago, the
Justice Department says.
   Three of the four were leaders of Rajneesh's 64,000-acre commune
in north-central Oregon where Rajneesh presided beginning in 1981.
   The commune, which became famous for its free-love philosophy,
its fleet of Rolls-Royces and its squabbles with longtime
residents, collapsed in late 1985 after Rajneesh pleaded guilty to
federal immigration charges and was deported. Another top aide
served more than two years in jail.
   Rajneesh died in January in India.
   The alleged target of the murder conspiracy was U.S. Attorney
Charles Turner, the lead prosecutor of Rajneesh. The plot
reportedly was thwarted by a power struggle within the commune.
   The arrests were made over the past week in West Germany,
England and South Africa, the Justice Department said Friday in
Washington. The four also were charged with illegal interstate
transportation of firearms.
   On Tuesday, a former bodyguard to the guru's personal secretary
pleaded guilty to conspiring to murder Turner. Alma Peralta,
formerly Ma Dhyan Yogini, was sentenced to two years in prison in
exchange for cooperating with federal officials.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the arrests followed a
five-year investigation.
   According to court papers filed in Peralta's case, she was
recruited in 1985 by Rajneesh's personal secretary, Ma Anand
Sheela, to be part of an all-woman assassination squad.
   Sheela, a native of India, was deported after serving 29 months
in federal prison for her role in various criminal activities,
including the attempted murder of the guru's doctor.
   She also pleaded guilty to poisoning several Wasco County
officials and to masterminding food poisonings that sickened more
than 750 diners at restaurants in The Dalles, the county seat, as
part of a plot to gain political control of the county.
   The commune was home to 4,000 red-clad followers who toiled
12-hour days to feed Rajneesh's dream of a model community and his
penchant for jewels and a collection of Rolls-Royces, one of which
he drove past his adoring followers each day.
   The crowd swelled to 15,000 during summer festivals. His views
on free love changed after the advent of AIDS.
   Rajneeshpuram was incorporated as a city on part of the commune
in 1982. Disciples also moved into nearby Antelope, a town of 40
people, eventually holding all its elected offices and changing its
name to City of Rajneesh. The name was changed back to Antelope in
1985 at Rajneesh's suggestion, as a way to make peace with the
angry Oregonians.
   Those whose arrests were announced Friday were:
   -Catherine Jane Stubbs, 45, also known as Ma Shanti Bhadra, a
native of Australia who was vice president of Rajneesh Medical
Corp. and treasurer of Rajneesh Foundation International. She
earlier served time in federal prison for trying to kill Rajneesh's
physician.
   -Ann Phyllis McCarthy, 43, also known as Ma Yoga Vidya, a native
of South Africa. She was president of the Rajneesh Neo-Sannyas
International Commune.
   -Susan Lissanevitch, 43, also known as Ma Anand Su, a native of
England. She was president of Rajneesh Investment Corp.
   -Richard Kevin Langford, 40, also known as Swami Anugiten, a
native of Syracuse, N.Y. He was a member of the Rajneeshpuram Peace
Force, or police department.
   Stubbs and Langford were arrested in West Germany, Lissanevitch
was arrested in England, and McCarthy was arrested in South Africa.
   The Justice Department will try to extradite the four. If
convicted, they face a maximum of life in prison.

   An international conference seeking tighter
nuclear export controls ended without a formal accord Saturday
after the United States and Mexico disagreed on the issue of atomic
weapons tests.
   Oswaldo de Rivero of Peru, chairman of the meeting reviewing
compliance with the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty, said Mexico
blocked consensus on a final declaration ``which would have
contained important advances in the non-proliferation of nuclear
weapons.''
   Earlier, Mexico appeared ready to drop its call for a halt to
nuclear testing by 1995 in return for a commitment by the United
States, Britain and the Soviet Union to begin negotiations on a
ban, conference sources said.
   The compromise collapsed when Western countries wanted to insert
a reference to ``step-by-step'' negotiations. Mexico apparently saw
the phrase as an attempt to water down the pledge by the nuclear
powers, said the sources, speaking on condition of anomyity.
   U.S. policy states testing is needed to ensure the safety and
reliability of nuclear weapon stockpiles. U.S. officials also note
two of the world's five nuclear weapon powers, France and China,
are not members of the treaty organization.
   The treaty binds states that do not possess nuclear weapons from
building or acquiring them. In return, the three nuclear weapon
states in the pact - the United States, Britain and the Soviet
Union - pledge to work toward nuclear disarmament and to provide
non-military atomic technology to other nations.
   The four-week meeting, attended by about 100 of the the group's
141 member countries, ended early Saturday after unsuccessful
negotiations between Mexico, the United States and other nations.
   Spurred by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, delegates agreed
Friday on draft measures aimed at strengthening the treaty's ban on
the spread of nuclear weapons. Iraq is a member of the group, but
has tried to acquire possible nuclear bomb parts.
   The draft measures were to have been included in a final
conference declaration.
   ``Because there was no final document adopted, the texts which
had been negotiated in the conference have no legal status,''
conference spokeswoman Lucy Webster said.
   Members of the treaty organization meet every five years.

   It's not easy playing second fiddle
to the nation's No. 2 man, especially when someone is an ambitious
person, says Vice President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn.
   Mrs. Quayle was a straight-A law student at Indiana University
and a career-minded woman when she met Quayle 18 years ago.
   ``I was never going to get married. I was never going to have
children,'' The Detroit News quoted her in Saturday's editions. She
married Quayle 10 weeks after they met.
   She certainly didn't envision a full-time career as a spouse,
said Mrs. Quayle, who was in Grand Rapids to address the Michigan
Bar Association while her husband played golf with the Detroit
Pistons' Bill Laimbeer at a Republican fund-raiser. But she has
taken on the job with relish.
   ``I'm one of those people. You take me where I am and I'll do
the best job I can, and I'll take every advantage of the situation,
every advantage of the moment,'' she said.
   On Saturday, the vice president and his family were in West
Virginia, rafting down one of America's toughest white water
rivers, the Gauley River. They were surrounded by Secret Service
agents and raft guides.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - A gathering of rap music artists will star in
a Hollywood benefit this week for soul singer Curtis Mayfield, who
was paralyzed by an accident at a New York concert last month.
   The lineup for the Monday night show at the Palace includes
Ice-T, Tone Loc, Eazy E, Mellow Man Ace, Kid Frost, C.P.O., King
Tee, and Def Jef. Mayfield's original group, the Impressions, wll
also appear.
   Proceeds from the $25 tickets will go to Curtis' family, Capitol
Records announced.
   Most of the show's stars had recorded with Mayfield on his new
soundtrack album, ``The Return of Superfly,'' which was released by
Capitol on Aug. 21.
   ``Everyone who performed on the `Return of Superfly' soundtrack
donated their talents immediately to come to Curtis' aid in his
time of need,'' record company official Tim Devine said in a
statement.
   Mayfield, 48, was about to take the stage at an outdoor concert
in Brooklyn Aug. 13 when a gust toppled a light tower, causing
critical head and neck injuries.
   He has since been moved from New York to a spinal care treatment
center near his Atlanta home.
   Mayfield was one of the founders of the Impressions and he
composed the best-selling ``Superfly'' soundtrack.

in Williamson County General Sessions Court on Aug. 1 when West did
not leave the premises.
   A hearing on the matter was delayed when she filed for
bankruptcy protection.
   West has been beset by financial problems that include an
outstanding debt of $110,000 claimed by her former financial

   FINDLAY, Ohio (AP) - The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader,
will visit this northwestern Ohio city next spring to take part in
a ``Year of Tibet'' celebration.
   The event, sponsored by the University of Findlay and others, is
being staged throughout the year to make people more aware of Tibet
and its culture.
   The Dalai Lama will speak March 25 to local high school class
presidents on ``Compassion and Leadership,'' said Carole Elchert, a
professor at the university. The stopover will be the first on his
scheduled spring tour of the United States.
   The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in the 1950s when it was occupied by
China and has since lived in exile in Dharmsala, India.
   He won the 1989 Nobel Prize for peace for his dedication to
nonviolence in his efforts to achieve independence for Tibet.

   The spacecraft Magellan bombarded Venus
with radar Saturday in the first attempt to make pictures of the
planet's cloud-shrouded surface since engineers temporarily lost
touch with it last month.
   ``Most people are sighing with relief,'' said Jim Scott,
Magellan mission director at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``We're just happy to
get into the position where we wanted to be.''
   Acting on computerized commands radioed 154.9 million miles from
Earth, Magellan started bouncing radar off the planet during the
morning and engineers received confirmation 13 minutes later, Scott
said.
   NASA's Deep Space Network tracking station at Goldstone, Calif.,
started receiving data on the radar images, and computers will
assemble it into pictures that will be released to the public early
this week, said Ed Sherry, technical assistant to Magellan's
project manager.
   ``I'm just delighted. I'm happy as a clam,'' he said.
   Magellan's $744 million mission is designed to produce the most
detailed pictures yet of Venus' surface, totally concealed by
clouds, as well as a global map of the planet. It was launched from
the space shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989, and started orbiting
Venus on Aug. 10, after a looping 948 million-mile voyage from
Earth.
   The spacecraft's radar makes pictures 10 times more detailed
than those produced by Earth-based radar or radar on the Soviet
Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft, which reached Venus in the mid-1980s.
   Engineers lost radio contact with Magellan for 14 hours starting
Aug. 16, then for 17{ hours beginning Aug. 21. They still haven't
learned the cause of the temporary blackouts, which they believe
could happen again.
   But they gave Magellan new computer instructions so it can
recover quickly from future communications breakdowns.
   The Aug. 16 blackout happened only hours after Magellan used its
radar for its first pictures of Venus during two orbits around the
planet. Only 1{ orbits worth of picture information was sent to
Earth before contact was lost.
   Half the remaining picture information was radioed to Earth on
Wednesday and the rest was sent back Saturday before mapping
resumed, Scott said.
   The first pictures showed Venus has large flows of solidified
lava; pervasive ``Venusquake'' faults; big meteorite impact
craters; volcanic cinder cones; large collapsed volcanic craters,
called calderas; and parallel mountain ridges and valleys like
those in the Great Basin that covers most of Nevada and western
Utah.
   NASA's official position is that Magellan's formal mapping
mission won't begin until late this month. But if all goes well
through the weekend, officials may decide afterward that the
243-day mapping effort began Saturday, Scott and Sherry said.
   Venus, the second planet from the sun, rotates once on its axis
every 243 Earth days. Magellan circles Venus in a nearly polar
orbit, so as Venus revolves beneath it the craft should be able to
map 70 percent to 90 percent of the planet during its 243-day
mission. NASA, however, has said it expects to use Magellan for
additional 243-day cycles so the entire planet can be mapped.
   Venus is considered Earth's virtual twin in terms of size, mass,
density and distance from the sun, although the planet's surface
has been heated to 900 degrees Fahrenheit by a runaway ``greenhouse
effect.''
   Magellan's goal to learn exactly what forces shape Venus, and
whether its crust is broken into giant drifting plates like those
that carry continents across the face of the Earth.
   Many scientists believe Venusian crustal movements are
predominated by ``hot spots'' - rising subterranean plumes of
molten rock like those that created the Hawaiian Islands.

<TEXT>
   A seven-foot Burmese python that
slithered to freedom through a pet store toilet has been found
after a month on the loose, somewhat skinnier but no worse for
wear.
   The snake turned up in a yard last week about a mile from Wet
Pets, where owner Brent Loewer had been keeping it in hopes of
selling the snake for its owner.
   ``He was kind of thin. He hadn't eaten in a while,'' said Lower.
   Loewer said he normally keeps the snake in a small cage, but
sometimes lets it loose in the store restroom for exercise. About a
month ago, he forgot one detail when he let the snake out for its
exercise slither: ``He loves water and I left the toilet open.''
   When he returned, the snake was long gone. Every few days, he
said, city employees checked a manhole outside the store, but
didn't find the snake in the sewer.
   He said he'd given up hope of ever finding the snake when a
woman walked into the store and asked what a big snake would eat.
   It turned out that the snake came out of hiding when a neighbor
began mowing his lawn Tuesday. Apparently afraid of the noise, the
snake headed up a tree in his yard.
   Loewer said the neighbor ran to his garage and grabbed a
hatchet, but the woman's husband stopped him from killing it, got
the snake out of the tree and sent his wife to the store to find
out what to feed it.
   When she described the snake, he said, he realized it could be
the python. He showed the couple photographs of the snake that had
been taken by its owner, and the couple returned the snake.
   Loewer said the snake is about 2 years old and isn't fully
grown.

   The man convicted of torching his 6-year-old

on Monday.
   ``I now believe I've been set up!'' Rothenberg said in a letter
to the Los Angeles Times.
   ``The parole agent told me he would assist with employment. He's
taken too long, gone on four vacations, had a face lift, gone to
golf games, and I sit doing nothing,'' Rothenberg wrote from his
cell at San Quentin state prison, where he awaits a hearing on the
alleged parole violation.
   The Times said it received the letter Friday. Excerpts were
published in Saturday's editions.
   ``My parole conditions state I can go anywhere I want in Alameda
County from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. It's as clear as daylight,'' said
Rothenberg, 50.
   Corrections officials could not be reached Friday for comment
and did not immediately return a phone call Saturday from The
Associated Press.
   Rothenberg set fire to his son, David, in a Buena Park motel
room in March 1983 after a telephone argument in which his
estranged wife said he would not be allowed to see the boy again.
The child lived with his mother in New York and had been
vacationing with Rothenberg in California.
   David, dragged from the inferno by motel guests, suffered
third-degree burns over 90 percent of his body. Now 14, he lives
with his mother and stepfather in Southern California and said he
was happy his father was back in jail.
   Rothenberg was convicted of attempted murder, arson and other
charges and received a 13-year prison term.
   After serving about half that, he was released in January for
good behavior and placed on three years' parole. Under terms of the
parole, he was watched around-the-clock and wore an electronic
anklet so his whereabouts could be monitored.
   State Corrections Department spokesman Tipton C. Kindel said
that Rothenberg went with a parole agent to a job interview in
Oakland on Monday, only to find the business closed. The agent
allowed him to wait inside a doughnut shop.
   Kindel said Rotherberg left through a side or back door and
called a second agent to say he was at another job interview.
   That agent told Rothenberg to stay put but he left again, Kindel
said.
   Agents found him about four hours later and he was returned to
prison, Kindel said.
   In the letter to the newspaper, Rothenberg did not address the
allegations he eluded the parole agents.
   If convicted of the parole violation, Rothenberg could face a
maximum six months in jail.

<TEXT>
   Two Marxist Palestinians who were banned
from Jordan for 20 years were greeted by loud applause as a
conference of leftist and Islamic groups convened Saturday to
demonstrate solidarity with Saddam Hussein.
   The participation of George Habash and Nayef Hawatmeh
underscored a growing alliance between Iraq and radical Arab
factions that is alarming Western officials.
   Habash is leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, and Nayef Hawatmeh heads the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.
   Habash and other Palestinian leaders were kicked out of Jordan
after the 1970 civil war pitting PLO rebels against the Jordanian
army. The war started when Habash's guerrillas hijacked three
jetliners and blew them up in the Jordanian desert.
   Habash was welcomed back at the start of a three-day conference
of Arab leftists and Islamic activists sympathetic to Iraq who
demand that the U.S.-led multinational force leave the Persian Gulf
region.
   Jordan's King Hussein, considered a U.S. ally, has been
inclining toward his powerful neighbor Saddam since Iraq invaded
Kuwait Aug. 2. The king has said he opposes the occupation of
Kuwait but wants an Arab solution of the crisis.
   In his speech Saturday, Habash urged Washington to avoid double
standards in dealing with Iraq's invasion and Israel's occupation
of Arab territories.
   ``We reject the U.S. principle of selectivity in dealing with
the U.N. Security Council resolutions,'' Habash said, in a speech
marked by ovations from the audience of about 150 delegates.
   Shortly after the invasion, Saddam said he would contemplate
leaving Kuwait only if U.N. resolutions calling for Israel's
withdrawal from occupied lands were implemented at the same time.
Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights in
1967, and has held a border strip in south Lebanon since 1982.
   Saddam's declaration threw many Palestinian leaders into his
camp. Habash, who had been based in Syria, recently moved his
headquarters to Baghdad.
   Suleiman Arar, speaker of Jordan's House of Representatives,
warned against the formation of a U.S.-led alliance in the Gulf.
   ``The sole successful solution lies in the Arab context without
foreign pressures,'' he said.
   The three-day conference, patronized by the Jordanian monarch,
is being held under the slogan of ``expressing solidarity with Iraq
in its confrontation of the imperialist offensive in the Gulf.''
   The delegates represent about 20 parties and political groups
from Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, Sudan, Mauritania, Yemen,
Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and the PLO.
   Egyptian opposition parliament members planned to attend but
were barred from traveling to Jordan by the government of President
Hosni Mubarak, which has sent forces to Saudi Arabia to oppose
Iraq.
   Hawatmeh took a more moderate stance than Habash during a news
conference Friday. But he made clear that Palestinians would
support Iraq against Western aggression.
   ``We say to the aggressors: Hands off the gulf region. If an
aggression takes place, all of us will side with Iraq,'' Hawatmeh
said.
   He implicitly supported Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait, however,
when he said, ``A solution to the gulf crisis should depend on
allowing the right to self-determination to all peoples of the
region.''

<HEAD>Reagan Visits Solidarity's Birthplace, Heads to Soviet Union</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto GDA50</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan honored the
birthplace of Solidarity on Saturday as the ``shipyard that
launched a half dozen revolutions'' and met with Lech Walesa, the
labor movement's founder.
   ``It is a thrill for me to be here at the place where Poland's
history has been changed forever,'' Reagan told a cheering crowd
after laying flowers at the Solidarity monument in this Baltic
port, about 180 miles northwest of Warsaw.
   Reagan, standing next to Walesa, praised the movement's
achievements during its nearly 10-year struggle to free the nation
from ``communism's stifling embrace.''
   ``You have triggered vast changes in the political map of
Central and Eastern Europe,'' he told more than 3,000 people
outside the main gate of the shipyard where Solidarity was
established in 1980.
   ``One might say this is the shipyard that launched a half dozen
revolutions,'' said Reagan, who later went to the Soviet Union as
part of a 10-day European trip.
   Walesa thanked Reagan and the American people for their support
of Solidarity, which now controls the government.
   ``Your position, firmness and consistency meant hope and help
for us in the most difficult moments,'' the Solidarity chairman
said as the crowd chanted ``Reagan, Reagan.''
   After the rally, Reagan and Walesa met privately for about 30
minutes.
   Reagan made a brief visit to St. Brygida's church, Solidarity's
spiritual shrine, and then flew with his wife, Nancy, to the Soviet
city of Leningrad.
   His five-day Soviet visit is scheduled to include talks with
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and a speech to members of the
Supreme Soviet parliament on Monday, the Tass news agency said.
   Reagan addressed Poland's Parliament on Friday. He also met with
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, the army general and former Communist Party leader who
last year agreed to turn over the government to Solidarity.
   Reagan imposed strict sanctions on Poland's Communist regime
after Jaruzelski declared martial law in 1981. Many current
political leaders credit the sanctions with helping pressure the
government into democratic concessions.
   Reagan's visit to Poland was organized by Project Hope, a
charitable organization that runs a children's hospital in Krakow
in southern Poland.
   Reagan arrived in Poland from Berlin, where he chipped at the
remnants of the Berlin Wall. He is scheduled to visit Italy after
leaving the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Government Troops Seek Control of Hospital in Rebel-Held Area</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops advanced through
booby-trapped buildings and mined streets Saturday, seeking to
capture an abandoned hospital and gain a strategic edge in
war-ravaged Jaffna, military officials said.
   The hospital is in the center of the rebel-held town and about a
mile from Jaffna Fort, controlled by government troops that claim
they defeated Tamil separatist guerrillas Thursday to end a
three-month siege.
   The government, meanwhile, warned citizens of possible attack by
Tamil forces in the northern Jaffna region, most of which is
controlled by the rebels.
   ``Due to the success of the security forces in the Jaffna
Peninsula, the (Tamil Tigers) heirarchy has instructed its cadres
to attack civilians,'' said a defense ministry statement issued
Saturday.
   Military officials did not say how far their men had advanced
toward the hospital. But a senior officer said troops were under
constant rebel fire and progress was slow because of mines buried
in the streets and booby traps hidden in buildings along the way.
   Control of the hospital would give the Sinhalese-dominated
government a major base in the town of 60,000 people and, more
importantly, a chance to win support among residents by resuming
medical services.
   The overwhelmingly Tamil town 185 miles northeast of the capital
city of Colombo has been a rebel stronghold since the separatist
war against Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority began in 1983.
   But recent battles in the area and the rebel's strong-arm
tactics of soliciting funds has sapped enthusiasm for the guerrilla
cause in Jaffna, recent visitors to the town reported.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed in the civil war.
   The government says 25 soldiers have been killed and at least
136 wounded since the siege on the 17th century fort was broken
Thursday. It claims more than 100 Tamil rebels have died.
   The Tamil office in London, however, denied the siege had been
broken. The rebels also claimed they downed a government plane with
a Soviet-made SAM-7 missile.
   The government acknowleged a single-engine ground-attack plane
crashed in Jaffna Lagoon on Thursday, but it said the pilot ditched
the Italian-made Marchetti aircraft when he could not pull out of a
dive after attacking a rebel gun position. The pilot was reported
missing.
   Military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also
accused the rebels of killing eight unarmed Moslem civilians,
including four children, in eastern Sri Lanka Thursday night and
Friday.
   Four guerrillas were killed in clashes with government troops in
the region, the officials said.
   The rebels seek political autonomy or independence for the Tamil
minority, claiming Sinhalese discrimination in jobs, education and
use of the Sinhala language.
   The Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the nation's 16
million people, control the government and the military.
   Tamils account for 18 percent of the people and live mostly in
the northern and eastern sections of the island nation. Moslems
make up 7 percent of the population.

   The world's 41 poorest nations received pledges of
solidarity but little else Saturday following a two-week United
Nations conference on development.
   The United States, Japan and Soviet Union refused to set aside a
portion of their gross national products to help the developing
countries as negotiations ended late Friday, participants said.
   The poor countries had asked that developed nations devote .2
percent of their gross national products to public development aid.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas closed the conference with
a plea to help the poorest nations break out of a ``vicious cycle
of misery.''
   Nations represented at the conference also disagreed over some
points of an assistance plan, including a proposal for
industrialized nations to join in helping Third World nations
reduce debt. Some conference participants also proposed linking
progress in human rights and political reform with aid and debt
relief.
   Jan Pronk, cooperation minister of the Netherlands, promised to

nations at the next meeting of the International Monetary Fund in
Washington.

<HEAD>Italian Minister: Gorbachev Offers to Restore Ties with Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ready to
restore diplomatic relations with Israel after a 23-year gap if
Israel agrees to participate in an international peace conference,
Italy's foreign minister said Saturday.
   Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has made it clear that
Israel would only consider taking part in an international
conference limited to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis met with Gorbachev a day
after the Soviet president met with Israel's finance and science
ministers. That meeting Friday was the first between a Soviet
leader and Israeli Cabinet ministers since the nations broke
diplomatic relations in 1967.
   ``President Gorbachev told me about the Soviet side's readiness
to recognize Israel immediately if it agrees to participate in an
international conference that would determine rules and principles
for security and cooperation in the region,'' said de Michelis,
whose country holds the presidency of the European Community.
   On Sept. 4, the Soviets proposed an international conference to
discuss the Persian Gulf, the Arab-Israeli dispute and the Lebanese
civil war.
   At the time, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said
the Soviet Union ``might take a fresh look at the issue of
Soviet-Israeli relations'' if the Jewish state agreed to
participate.
   Israel has long opposed Soviet-backed ideas for an international
conference over the Palestinian conflict, fearing such a wide forum
would try to force Israel to concede territory to the Arabs.
   Gorbachev met in the Kremlin Friday with Finance Minister
Yitzhak Modai and Science Minister Yuval Neeman, who were in Moscow
discussing a trade deal. The meeting was not announced beforehand.
   Neeman said Saturday in Jerusalem that Gorbachev's warm
reception of the Israeli ministers set the stage for establishing
diplomatic relations.
   ``We are bringing home a new atmosphere,'' he said on Israel
radio, adding that Israeli-Soviet relations had been ``raised to a
new level, that, I assume is the last before complete relations.''
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze are expected to meet later this month during
the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Levy has said he hoped that
full diplomatic relations between the two countries would be
restored soon.
   The Soviet Union for years was hostile to Israel, supported the
Palestine Liberation Organization and shipped arms to militant Arab
states, including Iraq. It cut off arms supplies to Iraq the day
after it invaded Kuwait.
   The two Israeli ministers reportedly discussed plans to build a
Soviet-U.S.-Israeli passenger plane and a proposal to send Israeli
produce to the Moscow area.
   Modai belongs to Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc. Neeman, a
nuclear scientist and longtime head of Israel's space agency, leads
the ultra-rightist Tehiya Party.

<HEAD>Germans To Provide Nearly $2 Billion in Aid for Persian Gulf
Effort</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on
Saturday extended nearly $2 billion in economic and military aid to
the drive led by the United States against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   The action, announced outside his country home in the Rhineland
after a 90-minute meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, overrode the hesitation West Germany had shown to more than
nominal participation in the U.S.-led Persian Gulf campaign.
   ``We are aware of our responsibility,'' Kohl said. ``We are
ready and willing to do our share.''
   Apart from the $1.87 billion Kohl pledged to the United States
and to poor nations, West Germany is contributing $271 million as
part of an aid package approved by the 12-nation European
Community.
   There was no indication that West Germany would contribute to
the military force assembled in the gulf to guard oil fields in
Saudi Arabia against an Iraqi takeover and to police the economic
embargo of Iraq authorized Aug. 6 by the United Nations Security
Council.
   Still, the German contribution marked a turnabout and reflected
the growing confidence of a nation, already the richest in Europe,
that will grow more power after unification.
   About half the German aid will go this year to the United States
to help defray the staggering cost of stationing troops in Saudi
Arabia and deploying a naval armada in the Persian Gulf.
   The other half, Kohl said, will go to poor nations battered by
the crisis. Kohl singled out Jordan, Egypt and Turkey.
   The chancellor said the West German constitution, which he hopes
parliament will change after unification with East Germany,
prohibits sending troops and warships to the gulf.
   But he said the forces there ``are also defending our
interests.''
   Asked if Iraq could be compelled to relinquish its control of
Kuwait short of war, the German leader said: ``I hope so. I am no
prophet.''
   He said Iraq, which invaded the smaller oil-rich gulf country
Aug. 2, ``has to acknowledge the largest share of the world
community is against it.''
   With tears in his eyes, Kohl thanked the United States for
helping to fulfill the German dream of unification, which will
occur Oct. 3.
   Baker said as Germany becomes larger and greater its
responsibilities grow.
   ``No one could draw any conclusion but that Germany is doing
more,'' he said. ``They go far beyond what we had discussed through
private channels - and substantially.''
   In all, Baker raised nearly $14 billion during his 11-day trip,
which ended with his flight back to Washington from West Germany.
   Three oil-rich Arab countries - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and the Kuwaiti monarchy overthrown by Iraq - volunteered
$12 billion after talking to Baker last week.
   About half will offset U.S. expenses, which will total about $9
billion by the end of the year, and the other half will go to poor
countries.
   ``I think that the trip has been very successful in terms of
pointing up the isolation of Iraq,'' Baker said.
   The West German assistance includes $636 million in radio
equipment, cranes, generators and equipment to protect U.S.
soldiers against chemical weapons. About 60 armored vehicles worth
$127 million are designed to detect chemical weapons. About $254
million will go toward transportation costs.
   Egypt will receive about $650 million in aid; about $135 million
will go to Jordan, which is saddled with caring for thousands of
refugees from Iraq and Kuwait; and about $75 million is for Turkey,
a NATO member which has lost the revenues of an Iraqi pipeline that
ran through the country and was closed at the start of the crisis.
   Kohl said the Turks also will receive from Germany ``some
defense materiel,'' for which he did not offer a pricetag.
   ``I was very pleased by the numbers that were presented to us,''
Baker said after West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher outlined the assistance earlier over lunch at Petersberg,
a new government guest house in the hills outside Bonn.
   Baker called the sums ``very significant and very substantial.''
   He later confirmed the offer with Kohl at his country home near
Heidelberg.
   Until Baker's visit, West Germany had offered $65 million in
technical aid to the U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. But the high cost
of unification with East Germany - $7.7 billion to the Soviet Union
alone to compensate for the withdrawal of 370,000 Soviet troops -
stoo in the way of a larger contribution.
   West Germany imports negligible amounts of oil from the gulf,
getting most of its supplies from Norway and Britain.
   Still, considering its wealth and world power status, the
Germans' distance from the U.S.-led campaign against Hussein raised
eyebrows in Congress.
   Italy volunteered a squadron of Tornadoes during Baker's visit
to Rome while Egypt and Syria said they would send more troops to
Saudi Arabia.
   Two countries Baker did not visit - Britain and France - said
they would send more troops, and Canada joined the international
force with a squadron of 12 CF-18 jets to fly cover for three
Canadian warships en route.
   France is sending 4,000 soldiers, including an 1,100-man
helicopter regiment, 48 tanks and a squadron of 30 warplanes and 48
helicopters.
   Britain is contributing an additional 6,000 combat troops and
120 tanks.

<HEAD>Report: Defense Minister Had Links to Secret Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three East German government ministers,
including Defense Minister Rainer Eppelmann, are suspected by
investigators of having cooperated with the former Communist secret
police, an East Berlin newspaper reported Saturday.
   Eppelmann said the allegations were ``totally made up,''
according to the East German news agency ADN.
   The Berliner Zeitung said Eppelmann, along with Construction
Minister Axel Viehweger and former Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl,
were also on a list of suspected former agents for the secret
police, or Stasi.
   The list of names was compiled by a committee set up by
Parliament to conduct a probe into whether any lawmakers might have
been Stasi agents.
   Officials overseeing the dismantling of the Stasi have said that
three government ministers and 68 deputies in the 400-member
Volkskammer, or Parliament, are suspected of having been secret
police agents.
   Their names had not been published until Saturday's report in
the Berliner Zeitung, which did not say how it obtained the list.
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said the government will
investigate the latest allegations.
   Eppelmann, a Lutheran pastor, often sheltered dissidents during
the Communist regime and played a leading role in the popular
movement that brought down the Communist government last year.
   He later helped found a small conservative party, the Democratic
Awakening, and became minister of defense and disarmament in East
Germany's first democratically elected government in April.
   De Maiziere's government has been rocked by growing allegations
that members of his Cabinet and many legislators have past Stasi
links.
   The issue has overshadowed preparations for German unification
on Oct. 3, when de Maiziere's government will turn over control of
the economically troubled country to the West German government.
   A fourth Cabinet member, Environment Minister Karl-Hermann
Steinberg, also has been named as a suspected former Stasi agent.
   Meanwhile, Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel came under
more fire Saturday when an official charged that Diestel has been
hindering and delaying the purge of Stasi agents.
   De Maiziere's spokeswoman, Angela Merkel, said Friday that
Diestel had been stripped of the job of dismantling the Stasi
apparatus.
   However, de Maiziere said Saturday that Diestel will remain the
top official in charge of the operation, although his deputy
Eberhard Stief was given the job of directly supervising the
process.
   On Thursday, Diestel survived a parliamentary motion for his
ouster from office.

<HEAD>Israeli Defense Minister To Visit Washington To Push For More Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens headed for
Washington Saturday to meet with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, and
Israeli media said he would seek more military aid in light of the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The daily newspaper Al Hamishmar said Arens would ask for U.S.
funding of a naval submarine project and discuss the U.S.
contribution to the joint Arrow missile project.
   Washington provided 80 percent of the $158 million in the first
phase of the missile project and has agreed to continue funding,
but exact amounts have not yet been set.
   Israel radio said Arens would also ask the Bush administration
to forgive a $4.6 billion debt. Bush said he would ask Congress to
waive a $6.7 billion Egyptian debt, after Egypt sent troops to the
gulf as part of the multinational force facing Iraq.
   A report in The Washington Post Saturday said Arens would also
ask Cheney to consider providing Israel with ``real-time'' links to
U.S. spy satellites. Such links would allow Israel to target Iraqi
military sites and chemical weapon facilities on short notice.
   Dan Naveh, Arens' spokesman, confirmed the Israeli defense
minister would meet Cheney on Monday but declined comment on both
the Washington Post report and on the agenda.
   ``There are many issues on the table but I do not want to go
into them,'' Naveh said.
   According to the daily newspaper Maariv, Israel has already
requested speedy delivery of Apache attack helicopters, additional
F-15 and F-16 fighter planes as well as two Patriot anti-ballistic
missile systems.
   In an interview on Israel radio last week, Arens said the
dangers faced by Israel in view of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
warranted more American aid.
   Arens said he belived Washington now had ``a more realistic view
of the the dangers confronted by Israel,'' adding: ``I hope that it
will also express itself in additional aid.''
   The supply of U.S. weapons to Arab states hostile to Israel is
also causing concern. President Bush has asked Congress to approve
an $18-billion weapons sale to Saudi Arabia.
   Naveh said in a telephone interview that with Western arms
available to Arabs, Israel must develop its own high-technology
weapons systems such as the Arrow missile.

   Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov said Saturday that
178 Iraqi servicemen are being trained in the Soviet Union under
contracts that expire in November.
   Yazov also told the Moscow Pravda newspaper that 149 Soviet
miitary experts are training Saddam Hussein's soldiers in Iraq. The
number previously had been reported as 190.
   Of the 178 Iraqis in the Soviet Union, 77 were in Latvia, with
the rest in Vladivostok and at the port of Poti, in Soviet Georgia,
Yazov said. All are ``due to go back in November when the training
program is completed,'' Yazov said.
   On Thursday, the presidium of Latvia's parliament passed a
resolution protesting the training of Iraqi troops at the Soviet
Navy Training Center in the Baltic port of Riga.
   Yazov said the military exchanges were the product of bilateral
agreements between the countries. ``They cannot just be torn up,''
he said.
   The Soviet Union, once Iraq's main military supplier, suspended
arms shipments after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.

   After days of waiting in the hot sun of the
Jordanian desert, nearly 2,000 Sri Lnakans boarded a passenger ship
Saturday for a 10-day trip home that started off with a meal of hot
curry.
   The voyage augmented a 10-day airlift organized by the U.N.
International Organization for Migration for tens of thousands of
penniless Asians who fled Kuwait after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion.
   The group is hoping to charter more ships as a slightly less
expensive way of moving the refugees. The voyage of the Sri Lankans
was costing about $780,000, said Yahya Maroufi, an agency official.
   The 1,767 Sri Lankans arrived in Aqaba in a convoy of 41 buses
that had picked them up in Amman. The Pakistani ship Safina-E-Arab
was starting its voyage Saturday night.
   Women in colorful saris and men in loincloths balanced bundles
and suitcases on their heads as they clambered up the gangway.
   ``We left Kuwait three weeks ago and have spent three terrible
weeks in desert camps. Now, at last, we are on the way home,'' said
Mohammed Maizer, a young man from Colombo who was accompanied by
his wife.
   Some were grieved by a traffic accident overnight on the
Amman-Aqaba road that killed 10 Sri Lankans. Jordanian officials
said it was the worst accident suffered by any of the 600,000 Arab
and Asian refugees who have passed through the kingdom in the past
six weeks.
   Arab refugees for the most part have been repatriated quickly.
But some of the 80,000 Bangladeshis, Indians, Pakistanis,
Filipinos, Sri Lankana and Thais have spent up to three weeks
waiting for transportation.
   The Sri Lankans boarding the ship were informed by loudspeaker
as soon as they boarded that a hot curry meal was awaiting them in
the dining room.
   Just down the coast from Aqaba, 800 Sudanese have been stranded
for two to three weeks waiting for their government to arrange
transportation home.
   ``We cannot do anything for them until the Sudanese government
asks us to help,'' said Maroufi.
   Maroufi said his agency so far had arranged transportation home
for 15,000 refugees, including those aboard the Pakistani ship.
   ``We hope that the number will increase to 35,000-40,000 by next
Saturday,'' he said, estimating the costs to rise by then to $25-30
million.

   Jordanian schoolchildren have written
letters pleading with world leaders to find a peaceful solution to
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``Please ... stop the war because I don't want to die, me and my
family and my dogs and cats,'' read one letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. ``If there is a war, I
will be scared.''
   The letter from third-grader Ammar Qweider was one of dozens on
display at a downtown hotel.
   The letters were organized by a women's group called Children's
Letters for Peace Committee, which asked children in Amman and a
major suburb to write them prior to Perez de Cuellar's peace
mission in Amman earlier this month.
   The letters were accompanied by collages and drawings depicting
scenes such as bombings and, in stark contrast, fanciful pastoral
settings. Many pictured children killed by war.
   One drawing showed two globes. One, labeled ``war'' in red
print, had horns, an angry snarl and a knife in its side with drops
of blood coming from it. The other, labeled ``peace,'' showed a
smiling, bright-eyed world.
   ``Please world leaders, I ask you to sort this out before
someone makes a rash decision and pushes the little button that can
ruin the world,'' read another letter by Dina Tinam.
   Not surprisingly, many of the letters struck a sympathetic chord
with Iraq and the Arab world in general.
   ``I'm sorry to inform you that the decision you took against
Iraq was a bit unfair,'' said Rami Bisher. ``There was no need for
any military action. The blockade itself was enough, 'cause I'm
sure there are some kids in Iraq suffering from the shortage of
milk and other goods.''
   Angie Hussanni wrote: ``Please tell Mr. George Bush that the
Arabs are not that bad. We are a civilized nation. Once upon a time
we were the best, and I can assure you we will be the best again
sometime in the future.''
   ``Please talk not fight,'' wrote fourth-grader Aboud Nasser.
``If there will be a war I will never get the chance to grow up and
become an architect. Just give me and my friends a chance to make
the world a better place.''
   The Amman talks between Perez de Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz ended without progress as the diplomats were
unable to agree on an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, which Saddam
Hussein's troops overran Aug. 2.

<HEAD>Thousands of Mourners Gather at Funeral for Slain Albanians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALATNA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of mourners, some traveling
on trucks and tractors, gathered Saturday for the funerals of two
ethnic Albanians killed in a gunbattle with police, the official
news agency Tanjug reported.
   The two men killed Thursday are among at least 64 ethnic
Albanians who have died in unrest in the southern Kosovo province
since Serbian authorities clamped down on the province's autonomy
in March 1989.
   Posters around the province urged attendance at the funerals,
which drew between 5,000 and 6,000 people to the tiny village of
Palatna, about 18 miles north of the provincal capital of Pristina,
the news agency reported.
   Extra police units were posted at surrounding villages, but the
mourners dispersed peacefully following religious and political
speeches.
   The men died in gunfire after police raided the village looking
for arms and foreign currency. Two policemen were injured in the
shootout.
   Early Friday, two other ethnic Albanians were shot and killed by
police at a roadblock, Tanjug reported.
   Serbia, which administers Kosovo and regards it as the heartland
of its medieval kingdom, dissolved the province's parliament in
July after ethnic Albanian delegates declared sovereignty.
Albanian-language newspapers were closed and radio and television
stations were seized.
   Serbian officials claimed the measures were needed to protect
the Slav minority in Kosovo from harassment by the ethnic
Albanians, who make up about 90 percent of the province's 1.9
million inhabitants.
   Serb authorities on Friday detained several ousted ethnic
Albanian political leaders on charges they met in secret Sept. 7 to
adopt a constitution and proclaim the province Yugoslavia's seventh
republic, media reports said.

   Twenty-seven years ago, four black girls
attending church on a Sunday morning died in a racist bombing that
tore at the conscience of Birmingham.
   On Saturday, at an ill-kept hillside cemetery where three of the
girls are buried, several dozen people, whites and blacks, gathered
in sweltering heat to remember them as martyrs for social change.
   The group also dedicated a state historic marker in honor of the
four and called for the restoration of the nearly abandoned
Greenwood Cemetery in downtown Birmingham.
   The girls - Addie Mae Collins, Carol Robertson and Cynthia
Wesley, all 14, and Denise McNair, 11 - died when a dynamite bomb
exploded in a stairwell of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church on
Sept. 15, 1963.
   The church bombing stunned the civil rights movement and broke
down resistance among many whites who were shocked by such violence
against children in a house of worship.
   ``They forever changed the face of this state and the history of
this state,'' said state Sen. Roger Bedford. ``Their deaths made
all of us focus on the ugliness of those who would punish people
because of the color of their skin.''
   ``They died so freedom could live,'' said Kenneth Mullinax, who
spearheaded the drive for a state historic marker and for a grave
marker for Addie Mae Collins.
   Robert Edward Chambliss, a white man linked to racist
resistance, was convicted of murder in the bombing and sentenced to
life in prison. He died in 1985 at age 81.
   Besides remembering the girls' short lives, participants
Saturday called for help restoring the cemetery where three of the
girls are buried. Denise McNair is buried in Shadowlawn Cemetery.
   Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a black leader in Birmingham during the
civil rights movement, said the bombing ``shook Birmingham. It
shook the world, in fact.''
   Among those affected was then-governor George Wallace, said his
son, State Treasurer George Wallace Jr.
   Until the bombing, the governor was an outspoken segregationist.
But Wallace Jr. said his father was ``shaken by the deaths'' and
condemned those responsible. ``He agonized over it.''
   The four-term governor later voiced racially moderate views and
won strng black support in his final victory in 1982.
   Mullinax, who worked in the last Wallace administration, said he
was angry about the condition of the cemetery.
   The grave of Addie Mae Collins had been marked only by a thin
piece of wood, with the writing on it worn off. Mullinax and other
donors bought a marker for the child's grave. Two of Collins'
sisters attended the ceremony, but did not speak during it and
declined to talk to reporters later.
   Wilheminia Anchrum earlier organized a drive to clean up the
cemetery, which once was an elite black cemetery in segregated
Birmingham but fell into bankruptcy and neglect in recent years.
Graves have been dug up and markers turned over.
   Anchrum and other volunteers cleaned up part of the cemetery for
the memorial Saturday and are raising money to establish a
permanent maintenance program.

<TEXT>
   A tribunal on Saturday began
reviewing corruption charges against ousted Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto in what her followers have characterized as a political
witch hunt.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, a conservative, dismissed Ms.
Bhutto and her government on Aug. 6. Last week, an army-backed
caretaker government filed four corruption charges against the
37-year-old former prime minister.
   Several of Ms. Bhutto's Cabinet ministers face similar changes,
and hundreds of supporters of her Pakistan People's Party have been
arrested.
   The special tribunal was set up to try corruption cases and
determine whether Ms. Bhutto and her allies will be able to run in
a new election scheduled for Oct. 24.
   If convicted, Ms. Bhutto would be disqualified from elections
for up to seven years. Criminal charges could follow.
   The special tribunals originally were created in 1977 to try Ms.
Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was
overthrown in a military coup and hanged two years later.
   The caretaker government has promised that many of Ms. Bhutto's
political opponents also would be investigated for corruption. But
so far the only inquirites have been into Ms. Bhutto's government,
elected in November 1988.
   Pakistani politicians, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the trials were bolstering Ms. Bhutto's image as a martyr, like her
father. They predicted the trials ultimately would fail unless they
were broadened to include her opponents.
   ``There is a feeling among many Pakistanis that this has not
been very fair so far,'' said a member of the Senate for the
right-wing coalition, known by its Urdu initials IJI, which opposes
Mrs. Bhutto.
   U.S. Ambassador Robert Oakley has said the tribunals should also
look into corruption from 1985-88, when the IJI parties and
politicians ran the government for the military.
   ``Otherwise, the proceedings will inevitably be seen as partisan
and further divide the country,'' Oakley said in a speech to the
Asia Society in Washington last week.
   The powerful army chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, has
reportedly urged Ishaq Khan to broaden the scope of the tribunals
to lend credibility to the process.

<HEAD>Italy Granting Soviets $2.7 Billion in Credits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy agreed to give the Soviet Union $2.72
billion in credits Saturday, one day after Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev warned that his nation is in danger of bankruptcy.
   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni de Michelis announced the loans
at a news conference following his Kremlin meetings with Gorbachev
and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   On Friday, Gorbachev presented an economic plan to the national
Parliament that proposes market-oriented policies and other
measures to halt the nation's slide toward bankruptcy.
   Gorbachev described the country's international economic
position as ``catastrophic'' and warned of possible government
insolvency on international markets.
   For decades, the Soviet Union was considered a good
international credit risk because the government always promptly
paid its import bills. But because of a widening trade gap, the
Soviets have fallen behind on their payments and are seeking trade
credits from other nations.
   West Germany has already agreed to give more than $3 billion in
credits to the Soviet Union. That is on top of the $7.6 billion
Bonn has pledged to pay to cover the costs of withdrawing Soviet
troops from East Germany in connection with German reunification.
   Other Western European countries are also expected to grant
loans to the Soviets, but the United States has so far rejected
proposals for direct financial aid to Moscow. The Bush
administration has said the any massive infusion of funds might be
wasted if the Soviet economy does not first undergo a major
overhaul.
   Washington instead has offered technical assistance, including
advice on improving the collapsing food distribution system or how
to establish private banking.
   
   De Michelis also said he talked with Soviet leaders about the
creation of a stabilization and currency reform fund as well as a
balance-of-payments support fund for the Soviet Union.
   Western countries provided a $1 billion backup fund for Poland
to support its currency, the zloty, when it became internally
convertible on Jan. 1 as part of its crash transition to a market
economy. The fund has not been touched and is viewed as a
successful confidence-builder for the zloty.
   But a similar project for the Soviet Union would be far more
expensive, given the size of the Soviet economy.
   De Michelis said the aid proposals were related to the Soviet
economic reform plan, which envisions a crash program of
budget-cutting and selling off government property to the public to
stabilize the nearly worthless ruble.
   After the money supply is balanced and store shelves refilled,
Gorbachev proposes completing the switch to a market economy by
gradually freeing prices.
   De Michelis said the two sides also discussed deals involving
fuel, electric power and telecommunications. The Soviet Union
reportedly is trying to gain Western help to develop its oil
reserves.
   He said $1 billion of $2.72 billion in Italian credits would not
be tied to particular trade deals.
   He said the two countries also agreed to write a new treaty on
friendship and cooperation, to be signed when Gorbachev visits Rome
before the end of the year.
   On the gulf crisis, de Michelis said one topic of discussion was
an Italian proposal to extend sanctions to countries that violate
the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq. He said they also discussed
extending the sea blockade to air shipments.
   ``We agreed we should put maximum political and economic
pressure on Iraq to ensure its political isolation,'' de Michelis
said.
   De Michelis also reported that Gorbachev is ready to restore
diplomatic relations with Israel after a 23-year gap, if Israel
agrees to participate in an international Middle East peace
conference.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on
Saturday extended nearly $2 billion in economic and military aid to
the drive led by the United States against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   The action, announced outside his country home in the Rhineland
after a 90-minute meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, overrode the hesitation West Germany had shown to more than
nominal participation in the U.S.-led Persian Gulf campaign.
   ``We are aware of our responsibility,'' Kohl said. ``We are
ready and willing to do our share.''
   Apart from the $1.87 billion Kohl pledged to the United States
and to poor nations, West Germany is contributing $271 million as
part of an aid package approved by the 12-nation European
Community.
   There was no indication that West Germany would contribute to
the military force assembled in the gulf to guard oil fields in
Saudi Arabia against an Iraqi takeover and to police the economic
embargo of Iraq authorized Aug. 6 by the United Nations Security
Council.
   Still, the German contribution marked a turnabout and reflected
the growing confidence of a nation, already the richest in Europe,
that will grow more powerful after unification.
   About half the German aid will go this year to the United States
to help defray the staggering cost of stationing troops in Saudi
Arabia and deploying a naval armada in the Persian Gulf.
   The other half, Kohl said, will go to poor nations battered by
the crisis. Kohl singled out Jordan, Egypt and Turkey.
   The chancellor said the West German constitution, which he hopes
parliament will change after unification with East Germany,
prohibits sending troops and warships to the gulf.
   But he said the forces there ``are also defending our
interests.''
   Asked whether Iraq could be compelled to relinquish its control
of Kuwait short of war, the German leader said: ``I hope so. I am
no prophet.''
   He said Iraq, which invaded the smaller oil-rich gulf country
Aug. 2, ``has to acknowledge the largest share of the world
community is against it.''
   With tears in his eyes, Kohl thanked the United States for
helping to fulfill the German dream of unification, which will
occur Oct. 3.
   Baker said as Germany becomes larger and greater its
responsibilities grow.
   ``No one could draw any conclusion but that Germany is doing
more,'' he said. ``They go far beyond what we had discussed through
private channels - and substantially.''
   In all, Baker raised nearly $14 billion during his 11-day trip,
which ended with his flight back to Washington from West Germany.
   Three oil-rich Arab countries - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and the Kuwaiti monarchy overthrown by Iraq - volunteered
$12 billion after talking to Baker last week.
   About half will offset U.S. expenses, which will total about $9
billion by the end of the year, and the other half will go to poor
countries.
   ``I think that the trip has been very successful in terms of
pointing up the isolation of Iraq,'' Baker said.
   Later, at a news conference at Cologne airport, before flying
home, Baker said: ``To say we are pleased ... would be an
understatement.''
   Asked whether Iraq could be stopped short of war, Baker said:
``It's our strong preference that it be solved without war.''
   But he said the United States would not water down its demand
for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and was keeping all options
option to attain that end.
   He characterized Saddam Hussein as mercurial and said, ``I don't
think anyone can predict what action he will take.''
   On a related subject, Baker, who telephoned President Bush
before boarding his plane for the flight home, said he had asked
the Soviets during his stop in Moscow to help transport the
additional troops Syria was sending to Saudi Arabia and that the
request would be considered.
   An estimated 15,000 Syrian troops are to be added to the 3,000
already in Saudi Arabia.
   The West German assistance includes $636 million in radio
equipment, cranes, generators and equipment to protect U.S.
soldiers against chemical weapons. About 60 armored vehicles worth
$127 million are designed to detect chemical weapons. About $254
million will go toward transportation costs.
   Egypt will receive about $650 million in aid; about $135 million
will go to Jordan, which is saddled with caring for thousands of
refugees from Iraq and Kuwait; and about $75 million is for Turkey,
a NATO member which has lost the revenues of an Iraqi pipeline that
ran through the country and was closed at the start of the crisis.
   Kohl said the Turks also will receive from Germany ``some
defense materiel,'' for which he did not offer a pricetag.
   ``I was very pleased by the numbers that were presented to us,''
Baker said after West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher outlined the assistance earlier over lunch at Petersberg,
a new government guest house in the hills outside Bonn.
   Baker called the sums ``very significant and very substantial.''
   He later confirmed the offer with Kohl at his country home near
Heidelberg.
   Until Baker's visit, West Germany had offered $65 million in
technical aid to the U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. But the high cost
of unification with East Germany - $7.7 billion to the Soviet Union
alone to compensate for the withdrawal of 370,000 Soviet troops -
stood in the way of a larger contribution.
   West Germany imports negligible amounts of oil from the gulf,
getting most of its supplies from Norway and Britain.
   Still, considering its wealth and world power status, the
Germans' distance from the U.S.-led campaign against Hussein raised
eyebrows in Congress.
   Italy volunteered $145 million and a squadron of Tornadoes
during Baker's visit to Rome while Egypt and Syria said they would
send more troops to Saudi Arabia.
   Two countries Baker did not visit - Britain and France - said
they would send more troops, and Canada joined the international
force with a squadron of 12 CF-18 jets to fly cover for three
Canadian warships en route.
   France is sending 4,000 soldiers, including an 1,100-man
helicopter regiment, 48 tanks and a squadron of 30 warplanes and 48
helicopters.
   Britain is contributing an additional 6,000 combat troops and
120 tanks.

<HEAD>Carter's Former Pilot Says He May Return to Iran</HEAD>

   Jimmy Carter's former pilot, who left Iran last
week after being imprisoned there for nine years, said Saturday he
may return to that country.
   E. David Rabhan said Saturday he had been told by Iranian court
officials he could resume his work there if he chose.
   ``They've given me a letter saying I could come back to Iran,
travel in Iran, just be free in Iran,'' he said in a telephone
interview from the home of his mother, Frances Rabhan, in Savannah.
``If I choose to go back, I feel that I can.''
   Rabhan, 64, who had worked as a businessman in Iran, flew to
Savannah late Friday following a private reunion with former
President Carter at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.
   Rabhan's relationship with Carter dates back to at least 1970,
when he volunteered his services as a pilot during Carter's second
campaign for governor of Georgia.
   He credited Carter's efforts to get him released.
   ``They are dear friends,'' said Rabhan's sister, Joan Jacobson,
who also met him at the Atlanta airport.
   He said he was unprepared for the reporters who met his flight
from Zurich, Switzerland, and peppered him with questions.
   ``Really, I didn't expect to have anybody be concerned about
it,'' Rabhan said, adding that he objected only to what he called
``the stupid questions like, `How does it feel to be free?' What do
they expect me to say?''
   Rabhan went to Iran in 1976 to begin a business using a fish
protein concentrate to make breads and snack foods. He was arrested
in September 1981, according to his attorney Phillips D. Hamilton
of Statesboro, Ga.
   His arrest came almost two years after the attack on the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran, which started the 444-day hostage crisis that
contributed to Carter's 1980 re-election defeat.
   Initially Rabhan was charged with violating Iran's financial
laws. He told Carter by telephone later that he had been charged
with spying.
   After leaving the presidency, Carter described Rabhan as a
``hostage,'' but neither the Reagan nor Bush administrations
considered him a hostage and his plight went largely unreported.
   According to letters he managed to get out of Iran, Rabhan said
he was physically abused and his weight once fell by 44 pounds. He
spent part of his imprisonment in solitary confinement in a
windowless cell, his letters said.
   He said his treatment had improved during the last two years.
   ``I think one reason was because of the concern that President
Carter had for me,'' he said. ``I also think the attitude of the
Iranian government started to change their attitude toward
humanitarianism.''
   ``The Iranians reassessed David Rabhan's case and determined
that he had never been guilty of any crime, and so they apologized
and let him go,'' Carter said Friday after meeting Rabhan's flight.
   ``He was never a spy. He never had any kind of connection with
the CIA or any sort of espionage or spying,'' Carter earlier told
The Atlanta Journal.
   Rabhan said Saturday he wanted to spend his time in Savannah
visiting with relatives and planned no special activities. ``I've
been without things so long that anything I do seems to be special
to me,'' he said.

   Police raiders here and in the Maryland
suburbs have shut down computerized operations in which they say
customers purchased chances in Florida's $100 million state
lottery.
   Thriving sales at both locations reflected a spreading
nationwide craze over the towering jackpot in the Lotto drawing set
for Saturday night.
   Police in Prince George's County, Md., raided a photo service
shop and seized betting slips and gambling paraphernalia as well as
a computer terminal.
   They said the terminal had been used to relay purchases to a
point in New Jersey and from there to Florida. They said no arrests
were made.
   Under local laws, only licensed vendors are allowed to sell
lottery tickets, and even they are allowed to sell only those for
the local lottery.
   Earlier, Washington police seized a computer terminal and $1,000
in cash from a dry cleaners. Police said customers paid $2 each and
received receipts for purchase of $1 lottery tickets. They said the
same establishment was selling chances on the California and
Arizona lotteries.

   The rumored tabloid headline ``BANG, WE'RE
DEAD'' was shelved for ``AIN'T OVER YET!'' as the nation's
longest-running daily newspaper dodged a bullet with help from its
unions.
   Post owner Peter Kalikow said the 505,000-circulation paper
known for its racy headlines would have to close Saturday without
union concessions because it has been losing $27 million a year.
   Ten of the New York Post's 11 unions agreed late Friday to a $19
million concession package that would eliminate jobs and shorten
work weeks.
   The holdout was the Newspape Guild, which represents 352
white-collar employees, mainly reporters and advertising staff. Its
negotiating committee voted 7-3 to reject the concession deal.
   ``They were saying, `Shut it down,''' said Thomas Pennacchio,
secretary-treasurer of Guild Local 3.
   Kalikow said the paper would publish until the Guild's members
voted on the concessions. A vote on whether to accept elimination
of 43 jobs and four work days a week was scheduled for Monday.
   ``I feel optimistic that when the members see it they will
approve it,'' said Post owner Peter Kalikow. ``If they turn it
down, the paper will stop publishing immediately.''
   The Post said in Saturday's editions the concessions from its
960 employees include 100 fewer truck driver jobs, down from 263;
its 70 printers cutting to a four-day work week and five fewer
paper handlers, cutting from a staff of 17.
   After the agreement was announced, a cheer erupted in the Post's
newsroom, where workers had gathered for what might have been their
final edition. Two versions were prepared and newsroom scuttlebutt
predicted the ``BANG, WE'RE DEAD'' headline if no agreement had
been reached.
   The Post, founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1801, was sold to
heiress Dorothy Schiff in 1939. Australian media baron Rupert
Murdoch bought it in 1976 and sold it to Kalikow in 1988.
   The possible salvation of the 189-year-old paper aside, one
writer chafed at the idea of a four-day work week.
   ``What am I supposed to do, drive a cab on the fifth day?''
Peter Moses said.
   Guild president Barry Lipton, who supported the offer, said ``It
was the best we could make. ... I hope that the sense of the
membership is to swallow what may be a bitter pill.''
   Drivers gathered at the Post loading dock Saturday, angry over
looming cuts and Kalikow's tactics.
   ``Today is no celebration,'' said driver Stan Infante. ``People
are losing jobs.''

   An American warship on blockade
duty rescued two Omani brothers drifting in a disabled motorboat in
the Gulf of Oman, U.S. military spokesmen said Saturday.
   They said the missile cruiser USS Jouett spotted the pair, ages
12 and 17, while on patrol Friday and took them aboard. The youths
said they had been drifting for six days.
   A medical examination showed them to be dehydrated but otherwise
in good condition, the spokesmen said.
   The rescue was reported to Omani authorities who were asked to
notify the youths' family.
   The Jouett is a member of the battle group headed by the
aircraft carrier USS Independence. The Gulf of Oman lies between
Iran and Oman and is separated from the Persian Gulf by the Strait
of Hormuz.

   AP Military Writer Susanne Schafer recently
traveled to Fort Hood with General Carl Vuono, the Army's chief of
staff, where elements of the 1st Cavalry and 2nd Armored Divisions
are preparing to ship out to Saudi Arabia. This is the first of
three reports.

<DATELINE>FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During the first hectic weeks of
Operation Desert Shield, the Pentagon said it moved enough troops,
weaponry and supplies to fill a mid-size town.
   But this fort's acres of tanks - and the 15,000 troops going
with them - are only just beginning to leave for Saudi Arabia. And
they aren't scheduled to get there until well into October.
   The row upon row of M-1 tanks, M-109 howitzers, armored
personnel carriers and assorted war-making machinery has become the
stuff of dreams.
   ``We'll all sleep better when it gets there,'' growled one
colonel accompanying a group of visitors on a tour of the
217,000-acre base.
   Fort Hood's 1st Cavalry and 2nd Armored Divisions represent the
heavy forces that the top U.S. military commander in Saudi Arabia,
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, says he'll need to have on the ground
before he can defend Saudi Arabia against any kind of Iraqi attack.
   But moving such massive amounts of material isn't an easy job.
   So the Army's chief of staff, Gen. Carl Vuono, came to this post
on the rolling Texas savanna to check whether his commanders had
prepared their men, women and machinery for the trip.
   ``It's show time!'' Vuono called out to a room of generals,
colonels and top-level sergeants, gathered to give him the update.
``Are you ready?''
   Lt. Gen. Richard Graves, the three-star commander of Fort Hood
and the Army's III Corps, briefed Vuono on the multiplicity of
headaches brought on by moving nearly one-third of his personnel
and hundreds of 60-ton vehicles some 9,000 miles to Saudi Arabia.
   It's been nothing but frenzied activity here since people
learned they'd deploy on Aug. 10.
   First, they had to get several hundred tanks, troop carriers and
howitzers ready for transport by rail to the port at Beaumont,
Texas. From there, the tons of war machinery was to be transferred
to huge container ships for the lengthy trip to Saudi Arabia.
   ``We've got lift constraints,'' Graves reminded Vuono during
their talk.
   In the intervening weeks, it had become clear the system for
sealifting equipment needed improvement.
   The rapid deployment forces from the 24th Infantry Division
(Mechanized) from Fort Stewart, Ga. - the first group to deploy to
Saudi Arabia with the heavy M-1 tanks - showed up at portside with
bridging equipment. Instead of the seven ships thought necessary,
10 were needed.
   So at least 13 ships - instead of the original eight - have been
scheduled to move the Texas units, a spokeswoman for the Navy's
Sealift Command said.
   And after the heaviest weapons are sent on their way, the troops
must be checked to ensure they've got the latest training and most
up-to-date supplies.
   ``Every soldier going is carrying a weapon that he's fired and
carrying a gas mask that he's trained with,'' Graves said. ``We've
got 12 days of personal training scheduled.''
   Before departure, hundreds of rounds of ammunition for each tank
and artillery piece must be prepared for shipment, Graves said.
   Gun barrels were replaced on the many of the units' more than
230 M-1 tanks. Metal treads on all armored vehicles were being
checked to see whether they'd sustained a minimum of 300 miles of
wear.
   On the individual level, commanders had to ensure that each
service member had the correct vaccinations, next-of-kin records
filled out and even HIV testing done.
   Families had to be informed and informational telephone support
line set up. About 1,200 family members showed up for the first
briefing, Graves said.
   Training reviews on everything from chemical weapons protection
to personal hygiene in the desert must be attended to.
   ``What about the mess cooks? You talking to the mess cooks? We
don't want the whole company down with dysentery,'' Vuono demanded.
   Flipping a series of view-graphs on the wall, Graves showed
Vuono that his personnel count was good: more than 90 percent of
his troops were deployable.
   In the count of all the men and women, 1.1 percent of the troops
were pregnant - a figure that translated into 8.4 percent of the
female troops being pregnant, and therefore ineligible for
deployment.
   Others unable to deploy were the 3 percent in transit because of
changes in orders; about 1.8 percent with medical problems; and 1.5
percent with some sort of legal entanglement.
   Down the road at a motor pool, a cloud of pink dust hovered over
a group of jungle-green trucks and tankers that were being painted
a rosy, desert beige.
   The general paused to speak to the officers and sergeants in
charge of an artillery unit, telling them in no uncertain terms
that they were ``entrusted with the most precious commodity that
this nation has - its sons and daughters.
   ``So when you're humping ammunition, when you're going into
position and the temperature is 118 degrees in the shade and you
are as bone-tired as you will be ... as a leader you have a
responsibility to push that aside and look out for those precious
soldiers,'' Vuono said, ``because they ask for so little and they
deserve so much from us.''

<HEAD>Saddam Hussein A Hit with Would-Be Rambos</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein may have been a
late entry, but he was a hit of the show this weekend as thousands
of would-be Rambos gathered to revel in exotic weaponry.
   ``They're just selling like hot cakes,'' Linda Blaha said as
customers eyed a 2-foot target showing a smirking Saddam - with a
bull's-eye centered on his nose. A young boy stepped forward with
$2 for two targets.
   Some 10,000 veterans, mercenaries and gun enthusiasts spoiling
for a fight turned out for the annual Soldier of Fortune
convention, which runs through Sunday. Khaki-clad military types
attended seminars on issues such as the Middle East and battles to
be won in South America.
   But the highlight of the annual convention, as it has been for
the last decade, was a collection of exotic weapons and gear
ranging from automatic weapons that fit snugly in the palm of your
hand to rocket and grenade launchers, knives, ammunition, stun
guns, tear gas and brass knuckles.
   The convention and its legion of warriors are never at a loss
for enemies. But Saddam made the list late, following last month's
invasion of Kuwait.
   One of the most popular T-shirts being sold at the sprawling
exposition showed a turbaned figure riding a camel fixed in a gun
sight. The message read: ``I'd Walk 10,000 Miles to Smoke A
Camel.''
   Richard Saindon, who was hawking the shirts at $12 each, said
they were ``going fast'' and there was a lot of anti-Saddam
sentiment.
   Blaha said the Saddam target, marketed by Quartermaster Sales of
Albuquerque, N.M., was one of the company's most popular items at
the show.
   How were buyers responding?
   ``They say they're gonna shoot straight.''
   One T-shirt read ``Operation Desert Shield: No Slack for Iraq''
while another showed a Marine choking a Middle Eastern figure and
asking: ``How Much is the Oil Now?''
   There were hundreds of books, including ``Surviving Hostage
Situations,'' ``Armed and Female,'' ``Nuclear War Survival
Skills,'' ``Survival Shooting for Women'' and even one titled
``Divorce Dirty Tricks.''
   Other T-shirts carried messages such as ``Gun Control is Being
Able to Hit Your Target,'' ``Mercenary - Dirty Deeds Done Dirt
Cheap,'' and ``Armed Men are Citizens. Unarmed Men are Subjects.''
   One shirt pictured three armed chipmunks with the message:
``Happiness is a Warm Machine Gun.''
   Another featured an American flag and the challenge: ``Try to
burn this one.''
   One booth was peddling boxes of photos, including several of
Adolf Hitler. One carried the inscription: ``No More Mr. Nice Guy
Next Time.''
   Nearby, Brian Barlow of San Francisco stood under a Soviet flag
and peddled Soviet pins, hats and military insignia.
   ``I've been surprised at the interest of the people,'' he said,
reflecting on the changing times.

   Police searching the apartment of a man
under investigation in a string of student slayings found a
hangman's noose, personal satanic writings and books on Satanism, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
   Authorities also found books on Jack the Ripper, pornography,
two pairs of women's panties and several knives in the Lakeland
home of Stephen Michael Bates, The Lakeland Ledger reported.
   The search was carried out Aug. 30, a day after Bates' arrest
for allegedly breaking into a home and threatening a woman and her
daughter with a knife. The last of five bodies in the college
student slayings were discovered Aug. 28.
   The newspaper did not identify its sources and said Florida
Department of Law Enforcement officials refused to comment on the
reported search findings.
   Bates, 30, has been identified by Gainesville authorities as a
possible suspect in the series of killings at off-campus dwellings
discovered between Aug. 26 and Aug. 28. The victims attended either
the University of Florida or Santa Fe Community College.
   Bates allegedly entering an apartment east of Lakeland on Aug.
21 and menaced a woman and her teen-age daughter with a knife. He
is in custody awating trial, with bail set at $100,500.
   Polk County Sheriff Lawrence Crow Jr. said Friday despite
interest in Bates, he isn't convinced.
   ``He's not a real strong suspect but he certainly needs looking
into,'' Crow said. ``I don't consider him to be an extra strong
suspect. More of a possible than a probable.''
   In Brevard County, Public Defender J.R. Russo predicted that
Edward Lewis Humphrey, 18, the other man named by Gainesville
authorities as a possible suspect, would be released soon.
   Humphrey is charged with attacking his grandmother, Elna
Hlavaty. She first told authorities that Humphrey had choked her
and hit her during an argument at her Indialantic home after his
return from Gainesville.
   In a hearing last week, however, the 79-year-old woman told
authorities her injuries were accidental and that she wanted the
charges dropped.
   Humphrey still faces possible prosecution in two other cases. In
Indian River County, he faces charges of attempted rape and armed
burglary for an attack on a woman in Vero Beach. In Alachua County,
Humphrey is accused of threatening two students at the University
of Florida.
   Russo said he thinks those charges will never be filed.
   School records show Humphrey was in school when the Vero Beach
woman was attacked. The victim also described her assailant as a
man in his mid-20s with a mustached. Humphrey was a baby-faced
16-year-old at the time and has never worn a mustache.
   Humphrey has been in custody, with bail set at $1 million, since
the alleged attack on his grandmother.

   Three towns of about 5,000 people
were threatened Saturday by a fire in the Stanislaus National
Forest in the Sierra Nevada that had charred more than 2,200 acres.
   Although the fire was considered 50 percent contained, its
eastern edge was still burning freely, a U.S. Park Service
spokeswoman said.
   That edge was less than two miles from the small resort towns of
Mi-Wuk, Sugar Pine and Sierra Village and about 5,000 people were
warned to be ready for possible evacuation, she said.
   A shift to damp weather Friday night caused unexpected problems
for firefighters. They had planned to set a backfire to control
that edge of the fire but it was too damp, and as a result the fire
threatened Saturday to go into the Tuolumne River Canyon.
   ``We are concentrating all our efforts on the eastern side,
because if it goes into the canyon, then Mi-Wuk, Sugar Pine and
Sierra Village are in some real trouble,'' said Park Service
spokeswoman Mary Hale.
   ``It's in a real bad area,'' Hale said. ``If it gets in the
canyon, those firefighters out there are looking at a long haul.''
   On the other hand, fire officials said they expected containment
by Sunday morning.
   ``It's like a see-saw today, it could go either way,'' she said.
   As of Saturday afternoon no structures had been destroyed and
fire officials reported only three minor injuries.
   Fire officials allowed about 400 people who had evacuated
earlier from a subdivision southeast of Twain Harte, in the Sierra
Nevada 150 miles east across the state from San Francisco, to
return to their homes Saturday.
   At one point before dawn Friday, flames crept within 100 yards
of the houses there, Hale said.
   The blaze, called the Cotton Fire, began Thursday in the
Riverside campground on the north fork of the Tuolumne River.
   ``We know this is human-caused,'' said fire spokesman Jeff
Fontana. ``We haven't had lightning around here.'' He could provide
no details about how the fire got started.
   A 147,000-acre burn tore through the Stanislaus forest around
Labor Day 1987.

   President Vinicio Cerezo said in a letter
to the U.S. ambassador that Guatemalan security forces may be
linked to the June decapitation of an Illinois man in northern
Guatemala.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman James Dickmeyer confirmed on Saturday
that Ambassador Thomas Stroock had received the letter, dated Sept.
6.
   ``People linked to the security forces could be responsible for
the death of U.S. citizen Michael Devine,'' Cerezo said in his
letter, a copy of which was obtained Friday night by The Associated
Press.
   ``It is our aim to pursue every investigation to determine such
responsibility, and if that's the case, find those responsible for
the act and apply the sanctions the law establishes,'' Cerezo said.
   Devine's body was found on June 9, one day after his wife,
Carole A. Moore, reported her husband's disappearance.
   Devine, 49, of Belleville, Ill., was owner of the Xobel de
Poptun inn and served as a guide for tourists. He also worked
transporting merchandise between ranches in the Poptun region near
the Guatemalan border with Belize.
   He was transporting goods when he disappeared, and he was robbed
of an undisclosed amount of money and his wristwatch.
   His body was found in a clump of bushes about two miles from the
town of Poptun, located 240 miles northeast of Guatemala City in
the province of Peten. It was bound and showed signs of
mistreatment.
   Cerezo said he has ordered the national police to clear up the
case as soon as possible, and has asked the Defense Ministry to
assist in the investigation.
   He said he has asked that arrest warrants and legal proceedings
be expedited.
   Diplomats in Guatemala have been pressuring Cerezo to put a lid
on violence.
   The Central American nation of 8 million people has been torn
apart by 28 years of leftist insurgency and brutal military tactics
to crush it.
   Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department put out a travel
advisory for Guatemala that warned of indiscriminate terrorist
attacks, crime and fighting between the armed forces and rebels.
   Cerezo blames the latest violence on right-wing elements trying
to destabilize his centrist administration. He has been the victim
of two military coup attempts that had conservative backing.

<HEAD>Hikers Warned To Stay Off Trail; Search Continues</HEAD>

   Police searched rugged hills Saturday for
a killer who shot and stabbed two hikers as they slept in a remote
shelter on the Appalachian Trail. Hikers were warned to stay off
the trail in Pennsylvania. ``Murders are very rare on the trail,
but we can't outguess somebody that is a murderer, so we're taking
precautions,'' said Brian King, spokesman for the Appalachian Trail
Conference.
   Geoffrey Logan Hood, 26, of Signal Mountain, Tenn., and Molly
LaRue, 25, of Shaker Heights, Ohio, were found dead Thursday by two
other hikers. Hood was shot and Ms. LaRue was stabbed repeatedly,
said state Trooper Rodney Anderson. Both apparently were slain as
they slept in the Cove Mountain lean-to shelter.
   ``They were caught off guard and somebody attacked them ...
sometime before dawn,'' said Perry County Coroner Michael J.
Shalonis. He said the couple had been dead 12 to 16 hours when they
were found.
   Police combed the area on foot and in helicopters Saturday.
   ``We're not assuming anything,'' said state police Cpl. Brady
Williams when asked whether the killer was thought to be in the
area. Police said they did not have any suspects.
   The Appalachian Trail Conference, which maintains the 2,140-mile
trail, sent out handbills to be posted in a 30-mile area
surrounding the shelter. The site is about three miles southeast of
Duncannon, a rural town 15 miles northwest of Harrisburg.
   ``The National Park Service warns Appalachian Trail hikers to
exercise appropriate caution, including temporarily bypassing the
Appalachian Trail in Pennsylvania,'' the sign warns.
   The Pennsylvania portion of the trail extends for 230 miles from
PenMar, Md., to the Delaware Water Gap at the New Jersey line.
   More than 3{ million people hike along the Appalachian Trail,
which runs from Maine to Georgia. The Pennsylvania segment is one
of the most heavily traveled, according to the conference, based in
Harpers Ferry, W.Va.
   King said the murders were the first on the trail since May
1988, when hiker Rebecca Wight, of Blacksburg, Va., was killed in
the Michaux State Forest in south-central Pennsylvania. Her
companion, Claudia Brenner, 31, of Ithaca, N.Y., was wounded.
   Stephen Roy Carr, then 28, was convicted of first-degree murder
in the slayings.

<HEAD>Auto Workers Union Goes on Strike Against Ford in Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Canadian auto workers went on strike
Saturday against Ford Motor Co. of Canada, as negotiators resumed
talks aimed at settling the dispute over pay, benefits and job
security.
   Parallel talks continued Saturday in the United States between
the United Auto Workers and General Motors Corp. after negotiators
in Detroit agreed to extend a midnight strike deadline.
   The UAW told its members not to strike while negotiators worked
to reach a new three-year agreement covering 300,000 GM workers
nationwide.
   The strike in Canada won't affect production until Monday
because Ford of Canada plants do not operate weekends.
   Up to 12,800 workers were expected to walk off the job at nine
plants and two offices in Ontario. The company has two plants in
Oakville, five in Windsor, one in St. Thomas and one in Niagara
Falls
   The Canadian Auto Workers union called the strike - the first
against Ford since 1976 - after negotiators failed to meet a Friday
midnight deadline for reaching agreement on a new contract.
   Negotiators for both sides met formally and informally Saturday
at a Toronto hotel. They were to hold a formal negotiating session
on Sunday morning.
   ``The process is continuing on both sides,'' Ford spokesman Jim
Hartford said. ``We are experiencing a strike. We're doing our best
to ensure it's a short one.''
   Union spokeswoman Peggy Nash said there were still many
unresolved issues separating both sides.
   ``It sounds like the two sides are still very far apart. (Ford
negotiator) Don McKenzie said he was still optimistic this could be
sorted out quickly,'' she said. ``(Union President) Bob White
didn't seem so optimistic.''
   The union's contract with Ford expired on Friday.
   ``Everybody is pretty much ready for this,'' Windsor autoworker
Tom Bellmore said after Saturday's strike announcement. ``Everybody
is resigned that this is the way it's got to be.''
   Like many of his fellow workers, Bellmore said he had stocked up
on groceries and other supplies in preparation for the shutdown.
   Both sides have refused to disclose details of their proposals
and demands. The union is seeking higher wages, including money to
help offset a proposed federal goods and services tax, better
benefits and more time off, White said. The average hourly base pay
now is about $15.
   White said progress has been made on job security, and McKenzie
conceded that money is the main problem.
   The union rejected the company's initial offer on Wednesday. The
union made its proposal on Friday, but the company has yet to
respond, White said.
   In Detroit, the UAW and General Motors agreed to extend their
national labor contract past its Friday expiration date, and talks
continued Saturday.
   Both sides have refused to disclose the progress of the
negotiations, but aspects of job security and benefits for GM
workers remain unresolved.
   In both countries, the auto workers unions target one company in
their talks in hopes of fashioning a pattern contract for workers
at other automakers.

   Seven Northern California wineries are
commemorating last year's deadly earthquake with Epicenter Cuvee, a
chardonnay bottled to benefit quake victims.
   The wine is being sold only at the seven wineries in Santa Cruz
County, one of the areas hit hardest by the Oct. 17 quake.
   The label on each bottle depicts the Richter scale, which
measures earthquake intensity, and a drawing of a ground-shock
record that tops out at 7.1 - the magnitude of the quake.
   Only 166 cases of Epicenter Cuvee - nearly 2,000 bottles - were
produced, said Marty Bargetto, marketing director of Bargetto
Winery, one of the wineries involved. A third of sales proceeds
will go to earthquake relief, he said.
   The quake killed 67 people, injured 4,000 and left 12,000 people
homeless.
   Jeffrey R. Smith of Roudon-Smith Winery promised that the wine
``will age gracefully'' and predicted it will be poured by ``those
toasting memories of the cataclysm they survived with their spirits
intact.''
   For those who want to lift a glass exactly one year after the
quake, the wine's label promises: ``This chardonnay should reach
its peak on Oct. 17, 1990, at 5:04 p.m.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: Florida Plant Tied to Poison Gas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iraqi architect of a Libyan chemical weapons
complex invested $5 million in a Florida cherry flavoring plant in
an apparent bid to export cyanide to the Middle East, a newspaper
reported in Sunday's editions.
   Two former associates said deceased financier Dr. Ihsan Barbouti
used the Boca Raton plant to establish a front through which he
could export deadly hydrogen cyanide and the technology to produce
it in quantity, The Dallas Morning News reported.
   The former associates said Barbouti sought to export the poison
to Middle East countries identified by the U.S. government as
supporters of terrorism. Barbouti acknowledged contracts with Iraq
and Iran, they said.
   Barbouti has been identified in Western news reports as the
architect of Libyan Col. Moammar Gadhafi's chemical weapons plant
in Rabta. He died July 1 in London on lung and heart complications,
according to his death certificate. He was 63.
   The president of the Florida flavoring plant said he had no role
in the diversion of any toxic material, but acknowledged that at
least 150 gallons of a cyanide compound were unaccounted for. The
cyanide was a byproduct of a process used to extract bitter almond
oil, a concentrate for cherry flavoring, from apricot pits.
   The cyanide could have been taken from Product Ingredient
Technology Inc. without his knowledge, Louis S. Champon said.
   ``My feeling is that it was his intention to ship out (cyanide)
to overseas,'' Champon said.
   Peter Kawaja, whose company installed a $1 million security
system at the plant, said the cyanide was removed during ``night
trips'' to another site in Florida he declined to identify.
   ``Shipments have left the U.S. and technology has left the
U.S.,'' said Kawaja. ``We're talking about the research and
development of chemical weapons in the United States.''
   Kawaja declined to identify the final destination of the
potentially lethal chemical.
   The newspaper said U.S. Customs and the FBI have accelerated
their investigation of Barbouti's role in the flavoring plant since
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last month. They are examining his vast
holdings in Dallas, Houston, Oklahoma City, New Orleans, Tennessee,
New Jersey and New York.
   The federal agencies declined comment.
   ``If there's an ongoing investigation, we're not going to
comment on it. Those are attorney general's guidelines ... I'm not
confirming that there is an investigation. I don't know if there is
or there isn't,'' FBI spokesman Jeffrey W. Maynard told The
Associated Press on Saturday.
   The Central Intelligence Agency also refused to discuss the
investigation.
   ``We decline to comment at this time. I would say, though, that
if there is any indication or intelligence of hostile activities we
would bring that to the attention of the appropriate law
enforcement authorities,'' CIA spokesman Peter Earnest told the AP.
   Customs Service spokesman Cliff Stallings in Miami said Saturday
that he had been in Washington last week and was unaware of the
case.
   ``You can quote me saying if it's under investigation, then we
won't talk about it,'' he said.
   Barbouti's holdings are controlled by his son, Haidar Barbouti,
who lives in New York City. The younger Barbouti has been president
and director of 20 to 30 of his father's companies.
   There was no answer at Barbouti's Manhattan residence or at the
Barbouti holding company, IBI Industries Inc., Saturday.
   Champon said he has filed a lawsuit to sever his business ties
with the Barbouti family. Champon said he and Barbouti often
quarreled about disposal of the waste cyanide and that Barbouti's
funding ``stopped when we flatly refused to send out any cyanide
complex.''
   ``Dr. Barbouti many, many times mentioned that he wanted this
cyanide . . . shipped to Germany,'' Champon said of the cyanide
waste from the plant.
   And according to Kawaja and Champon, the Barboutis asked the
plant's architect to computerize the blueprints of the operation
without Champon's knowledge.
   ``They were trying to steal the plans,'' Champon said.

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has awarded $13.6 million to auto racing
promoters who sued a newspaper for libel over articles about the
Cleveland Grand Prix.
   The case stemmed from articles written by reporter Gary Webb for
The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer primarily in 1984 and also in 1985 and
1986.
   The eight-member jury returned the finding Friday on the second
day of deliberations.
   Alex Machaskee, publisher of The Plain Dealer, said the
newspaper intends to appeal.
   The plaintiffs were Charles K. Newcomb and James H. Foster,
along with the company C.K. Newcomb and Associates. They promoted
the Indy-style car race at Burke Lakefront Airport starting in
1982, when the event was called the Budweiser Cleveland 500.
   The company, Newcomb and Foster sought $6 million in
compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages in the
suit filed in 1985.
   The plaintiffs' lawyer, Jerome S. Kalur, could not be reached
for comment; he was not at his office and has no residential phone
listing. Newcomb also has no listing. Foster was not at his
residence, according to a recorded message.
   In 1984, a week before the 1984 Budweiser Cleveland Grand Prix,
The Plain Dealer reported that Newcomb and Foster paid themselves
nearly $1 million from race proceeds in violation of a lease with
the city. Newcomb and Foster declined to be interviewed for that
story.
   The newspaper also said the race did not satisfy rent payments
to the city because Newcomb and Foster told the city the race was
deeply in debt.
   Lawyers for The Plain Dealer argued during the eight-week trial
before Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Joseph F. McManamon that
the primary points of the articles were indisputably true.
   But lawyers for the plaintiffs argued the race in fact lost
money its first two years and that the articles were false.
   Newcomb and Foster sold the rights to the race in March 1985 to
businessman and former race car driver Roger Penske, and The Plain
Dealer later became co-sponsor of the event.
   McManamon said the jury awarded C.K. Newcomb and Associates $2.2
million in compensatory damages and $2 million in punitive damages;
Newcomb, $2 million compensatory and $3.5 million punitive, and
Foster $400,000 compensatory and $3.5 million punitive.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California's fourth year of unyielding
drought is stirring fears that a continuing shortage could pit
thirsty city dwellers against agriculture, the state's No. 1
industry and biggest water user.
   The drought - with its images of parched lawns, dying trees and
depleted reservoirs - is an indication of things to come, said Neil
Berlant, managing partner of Water Research Associates, a
specialized investment and consulting company in Los Angeles.
   ``What's emerging out of this is one of the most politically
charged issues of our time,'' Berlant said. He sees a future in
which drinkable water is an increasingly precious commodity - like
crude oil.
   ``I think there is a great probability of prices exploding more
than anybody realizes,'' he said.
   The drought already has revealed residents' willingness to pay
exorbitant prices for water in Santa Barbara, where shortages this
summer prompted officials to consider building a costly seawater
desalting plant.
   What Berlant and others foresee is a collision between the
irresistible force of California's booming population and the
immovable object of available water supplies.
   They believe political pressures will bear more and more on
agriculture to reallocate water to urban users.
   ``The issue that comes to my mind is not whether you're going to
use farm water, but how are you going to do it in a way that's fair
and reasonable,'' said Carl Boronkay. He's general manager of the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which supplies
water to five counties in Southern California, including Los
Angeles.
   Rural water agency officials, on the other hand, predict that
political pressures will coalesce to support construction of new
dams and aqueducts.
   ``There's plenty of room to improve our water development in
this state,'' said Stephen Hall, executive director of the
California Farm Water Coalition.
   Agriculture accounts for more than $16 billion of the state's
$300-billion-plus annual economy.
   The drought, however, has exposed factors underlying the debate
that tend to run against agricultural interests, Berlant said.
   Imposing rationing on city residents, albeit well-intentioned,
focuses on the smallest sector of water users, he said.
   Most of California's available water - 82 percent, according to
the U.S. Geological Survey - is used for irrigating crops.
California leads the nation in water use, at 30.3 billion gallons a
day.
   ``An across-the-board cut in urban water use of 25 percent by
everybody - homeowners, commercial, industrial - would be the rough
equivalent of agriculture cutting its use by 3 percent,'' says
state Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg.
   ``It does tend to suggest that agriculture ought to be doing
something in terms of conservation,'' said Isenberg. He also has
called attention to the types of water-intensive crops California
farmers grow, including federally subsidized crops like cotton.
   Pastures grown for livestock use at least 4.2 million acre-feet
of water a year - enough for 42 million city residents, according
to Marc Reisner, author of the 1986 book ``Cadillac Desert.''
   In the book, he argues the huge effort needed to turn deserts
into farmland is a waste of both money and water. Alfalfa uses
almost as much, 4.1 million acre-feet a year, followed by cotton
and rice. One acre-foot is the amount of water needed to flood an
acre 1 foot deep.
   Agriculture officials counter that because farms use so much
water, they probably have the highest incentive to conserve.
   During the drought, state and federal water allotments to
agriculture have been reduced as much as 50 percent, although many
farms made up the difference by pumping groundwater at higher cost.
   Some farms have implemented drip irrigation and other low-flow
methods, but farmers tend to argue that their crops' water
requirements are fixed and can't be changed.
   ``I think the bottom line for me on conservation is that it
should be part of everything we do, but if it's all we do, we're
destined to have chronic water shortages,'' Hall said.
   Berlant argues there is little real incentive for farmers to
conserve because the water they get is so cheap.
   Many farms benefit from huge federal or state subsidies for
government water, paying less than $50 per acre-foot. In contrast,
Berlant estimates that residential water customers in Southern
California pay as much as $400 per acre-foot.
   In the future, widening price disparity could make farmland look
cheap to water-short cities, and some fear cities might move to buy
farmland solely to acquire the water allotments that go with that
land.
   Hall argues that trying to wring more water out of agricultural
conservation and water transfers ``is like a company on the verge
of bankruptcy cracking down on how many paper clips they're
using.''
   While the potential for antagonism is real, Boronkay sees the
differences between urban and farm interests as a chance to
negotiate rather than an opportunity to incite demagoguery.
   ``Some farm water represents part of the urban supply of the
future,'' said Boronkay, who added: ``God, that's fighting words to
some people, and I'm not just going to willy-nilly go around saying
it.''

   Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward Derwinski
apologized for referring to Hispanics as ``wetbacks'' during a
campaign stop for a Republican congressional candidate.
   The derogatory expression, derived from the crossing of the Rio
Grande by illegal aliens, came up during a discussion on drug
trafficking, Derwinski told television station KMTV in Omaha.
   ``And in the process, I got so carried away with my subject that
that term slipped, and I shouldn't have used it, obviously. Again,
I will apologize if I must, and I should,'' Derwinski told the
station Friday.
   Derwinski was campaigning for House candidate Ally Milder on
Friday. ``We're all sorry it happened,'' Ms. Milder said. ``It
should never have been said.''
   Derwinski said racist connotations associated with the term
didn't apply in his case.
   ``No, that's I think a phrase that you know is commonly used,
certainly it has no intention of being disrespectful other than
descriptive,'' he said.
   Gail Handleman, a spokesman for Ms. Milder's opponent, Rep.
Peter Hoagland, said she was ``shocked and outraged'' by
Derwinski's remark and also by what she termed his ``callous
insensitivity'' toward women.
   Derwinski has been criticized for using pet names like ``Zsa
Zsa'' and ``Little Miss Coffee Maker'' for women who work in his
office.
   Derwinski said Friday he has an informal office and that he
intends no slight against women. Derwinski said he has pet names
for male employees, too, and that his employees call him the ``Big
Cheese.''
   Derwinski, 64, a congressman from Chicago from 1959 to 1983, was
appointed by President Bush in 1989.

   Abortion rights protesters destroyed
symbolic credit cards of a department store chain and threatened a
Christmas season boycott unless the store abandons plans to cut
donations to Planned Parenthood.
   The demonstration outside Dayton's department store was attended
by about 500 protesters toting signs bearing slogans such as: ``I'm
pro-choice and I shop.''
   Another sign showed a Dayton's credit card cut in half with the
caption, ``You leave us no choice.'' The chanting crowd gathered
near doors of the store in the Southdale Shopping Center but did
not enter.
   ``We feel betrayed and sold out by a friend,'' Clare Gravon,
chairwoman of the Minnesota Alliance for Choice, told the mostly
female crowd.
   Organizers collected contributions to fund an advertising
campaign for the threatened boycott Gravon said would start the day
after Thanksgiving.
   There will be no boycott if the Dayton Hudson Foundation
restores funding to Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, she said. The
foundation is the charitable arm of the Minneapolis-based Dayton
Hudson Corp.
   ``Providing family planning and health care to low-income women
is the right thing to do,'' Gravon told the crowd. ``Caving in to
religious pressure groups is not.''
   Dayton's announced in August plans to halt a $20,000 educational
grant to Planned Parenthood, ending a 22-year relationship. The
decision came about the time the Christian Action Council said it
would boycott Dayton's and other corporations for supporting
Planned Parenthood.
   Dayton Hudson spokeswoman Ann Barkelew said the decision had
nothing to do with pressure from special interest groups, but arose
from confusion about the donations, which some misconstrued as
support for abortion.
   Barkelew said foundation trustees are reconsidering the decision
not to fund Planned Parenthood. She said talks with the agency were
held last week and will continue.
   ``We're confident we will reach a solution,'' she said.
   The company had annual sales of $13.9 million last year. About
half of its sales come during the holiday shopping season, Barkelew
said.

   For a while Saturday, those gathered in a
tavern's parking lot appeared to falling all over themselves. But
what they were really trying to do was put a right foot on blue and
a left foot on red.
   They were playing Twister, a 1960s game that attracted droves of
amateur contortionists who relished a chance to become Chicago's
Most Twisted Twister.
   ``We look at this tournament as wholesome entertainment for the
truly twisted,'' said Sandy Rose, the owner of the Blue Frog Bar &amp;
Grill, who donated a block of parking space for a Twister
tournament.
   The tournament's checkerboards were 25 multicolored,
polka-dotted mats the size of tablecloths tacked into the asphalt.
The contestants were tall and petite, masculine and feminine, and
generally jovial.
   ``I think you have to be a crazy person, a funny person to
play,'' said Brian O'Hara, 34, who last played the game in 1975.
   ``I love it,'' O'Hare proclaimed minutes before landing on his
backside when he tried to place his left foot on a yellow circle
during a warm-up match.
   Players had to shed their shoes, pick a partner and outmaneuver
another team by placing their hands and feet on the colored circles
haphazardly chosen by the spin of a wheel.
   The game ends when both players on a team lose their balance and
touch the mat with a part of their body other than a hand or foot.
   The best at putting their hands and feet on the circles Saturday
were Keith and Clare Bodner of Kansas City, Mo., winners of the
coveted Most Twisted Twister.
   ``It's a little like very low impact aerobics with more body
contact,'' Rose said of the game.
   Many players ended red-faced and weak in the knees after
tangling their bodies into unnatural positions.
   ``Point your toes. Oh, that hurts doesn't it?'' judge and
organizer Scott Phillips joked between commands when moans and
squeals emerged from the human knots on the plastic mats. Teams
played simultaneously as an announcer gave the commands until the
field was narrowed to two teams.
   ``I myself forgot how fun it could be from when I was a kid,''
said Janis Francis, 32. ``You can enjoy it at all ages.''
   O'Hara's team strategy was to outwit his opponent, while Francis
took a different approach.
   ``Knock 'em down, bowl 'em over and entice 'em,'' she said.
   The event drew about 100 people to raise money for Chicago
Easter Seals, organizers said.

   Plumbers trying to unclog a sewer line
found about $1 million in counterfeit $100 bills beneath a
university campus.
   Secret Service agents investigating Friday's discovery under
California State University, Long Beach, said the wad of fake money
appeared to come from the same lot as 10 phony bills passed in the
area over the past 10 days.
   Investigators said the counterfeiter probably decided to dump
the bills after people recognized them as fakes.
   ``My guess is that they decided it was unacceptable (quality)
and tried to destroy it,'' said George Franklin, an agent in the
Secret Service's Los Angeles office.
   Authorities said the money could have been flushed down a toilet
or dropped into the university's sewage system through a manhole.
   Authorities said they had no suspects.
   ``I'm kind of dumbfounded,'' said University President Curtis L.
McCray. ``I suppose it could have been someone here, but I find
that hard to believe.''

   Spitfires and Hurricanes from Britain's ``finest
hour'' in 1940 joined with jets representing the country's Persian
Gulf force on Saturday in a salute to the Battle of Britain.
   The procession of 168 aircraft flew over Buckingham Palace,
where Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip were waiting on the
balcony at noon. Also in the royal party was Prince Harry, son of
Prince Charles, who was celebrating his 6th birthday on Saturday.
   King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola of Belgium, and Princess Juliana
and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands represented Britain's
wartime allies.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and members of her Cabinet
watched from another stand.
   The flight marked the 50th anniversary of the turning point of
the battle.
   On Sept. 15, 1940, the Royal Air Force inflicted heavy losses on
the Luftwaffe as it staged a daylight attack on the capital. Two
days later, Adolf Hitler suspended plans for an invasion of
Britain.
   The 300 pilots and navigators were led by Air Vice-Marshal Bill
Wratten, Commander of 11 Group, which fought the Battle of Britain
in the summer and autumn of 1940.
   Wratten piloted a Spitfire Mark 2 credited with shooting down
three German aircraft.
   Two Hurricanes and five Spitfires from the Battle of Britain
Memorial Flight led the cavalcade, which included the Red Arrow
acrobatic team, a Lancaster bomber and some of the Tornado F3 jets
like those deployed with the multinational forces in the Gulf.
   On the ground, there was a parade of 1,400 Royal Air Force,
Royal Auxiliary Air Force, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, Royal
Observer Corps, Air Training Corps and other groups escorting the
standards of the 17 Battle of Britain squadrons still in operation.
   The Canadian, Australian and New Zealand Air Forces also were
represented.
   Also taking part were representatives of the Fire Brigade,
Metropolitan Police and the Ambulance Service, which fought their
own battles in 1940 against fires and explosions during the
bombing.
   A total of 534 air crewmen - one in six - were killed during the
battle and many others were seriously injured. The RAF lost 1,017
aircraft and Germany's Luftwaffe lost 1,882.
   After the battle Winston Churchill paid his famous tribute to
the victors: ``Never in the field of human conflict was so much
owed by so many to so few.''
   It was Britain's lonely resistance to the German onslaught early
in World War II that Churchill called the nation's ``finest hour.''
   On Sunday, the queen and other members of the Royal Family
planned to attend a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey.

   An American banker released from Iraq
because of a pleading letter from his mother to Saddam Hussein said
Saturday he's glad to be out although others remain Middle East
captives.
   Thomas Hart Benton Ewald, 25, of Greenwich, Conn., was one of
285 people allowed to leave Baghdad on a U.S.-chartered flight.
They arrived at Baltimore-Washington International Airport on
Saturday.
   Ewald said U.S. officials told him he is the first person used
as a so-called human shield that Iraq has released. Iraq has
deployed foreigners to military and industrial sites considered
likely targets in the event of attack.
   ``It's a very lovely story, really,'' said his mother, Mary
Ewald. ``In all this huge world, a letter can get through to
somebody.''
   Ewald said he was captured in Kuwait when he ventured outside to
mail a letter. He was taken to Iraq, where he was kept at an
installation he could not describe.
   ``I'm glad to be out,'' Ewald said. ``My friends and family are
very glad I'm out, so I'm very happy for them. I'm also happy I got
out because I can give more information about things that are going
on in Kuwait and the detainees.
   ``On the other side, there are the inevitable feelings of guilt.
I have some very good friends that I've made over in Iraq and in
Kuwait and that's difficult. That's very difficult to leave them
behind and not all the Americans are going to get out,'' Ewald
said.
   Robert Gould, a spokesman for Maryland's Emergency Management
Agency, said 114 people on the flight were U.S. citizens and 171
were foreigners. One hundred-forty-three were adults and there were
142 children. Also on the flight were two cats.
   A second planeload of Americans was expected to arrive Sunday at
the airport.
   An Iraqi spokesman said Mrs. Ewald's plea was the only one the
Iraqi embassy has received and that Saddam is open to similiar
pleas.
   ``(Saddam) gave the order to allow him to go free and to return
to his nation,'' Iraqi spokesman Riyadh Jawad said Friday in
Washington. ``His excellency, he wants to give examples to prove
that our behavior is not aggressive to our guests.''
   Ewald began work this summer with the Al-Ahli Bank of Kuwait,
arriving in Kuwait City two days before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion,
his mother said.
   Mrs. Ewald said she wrote Saddam a ``humanitarian letter''
asking that her son be allowed to leave. She declined to release a
copy.
   Ewald was one of only a few men on the plane. The Iraqi
government has been holding foreign men hostage, while releasing
some women and children.
   About 1,350 Americans remain in Kuwait and 200 in Iraq, with
about 75 being deployed as human shields, State Department
officials said.
   Ewald said he was taken into custody by the Iraqis Aug. 30, then
taken to a Baghdad hotel before moving on to the unidentified
installation Sept. 5.
   He said he escaped but was recaptured at a military base where
he gave himself up after hearing shots around the ruined house
where he was hiding.
   His welcome home included some teasing about how he got out.
   ``The fact that it's a note from Mom is pretty embarrassing -
actually it's a lot embarrassing,'' he said. ``My friends have
already started ribbing me pretty harshly.''

   A Soviet trawler captain sighted
what may be part of the fuselage of a missing Boeing 727 airliner
that carried 16 people, Canadian rescue authorities said Saturday.
   The jet disappeared Tuesday after the pilot reported a fuel
emergency and said he would ditch in the North Atlantic.
   ``Officials are fairly confident that what the captain sighted
... was a portion of the 727,'' said rescue worker Ross Brown.
   The trawler captain spotted an object 65 feet to 82 feet long
that was dark gray with red and white stripes, matching Air Malta
colors, Brown said.
   The plane, owned by Faucett Airlines of Peru, was leased by Air
Malta and was carrying airline employees and their families.
   The Soviet captain made his sightings Friday about 236 miles
southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, rescue officials said.
   However, Brown said, searchers had not spotted the object nor
had anything else been recovered that was known to have come from
the jet.
   Rescue officials didn't receive news of the sighting until
Saturday, when a ham radio operator overheard conversations between
several ships at sea.
   Search officials said at first they doubted the reports, but
after discussions with the captain were convinced he had probably
seen a piece of the fuselage.
   Weather conditions were deteriorating Saturday evening as
Hurricane Isidore moved northward in the Atlantic, hindering an
international group of planes and ships searching a
60,000-square-mile area, he said.
   The jet had been heading for a routine refueling stop in Gander,
Newfoundland, en route from the Mediterranean island of Malta to
Miami. The plane had stopped for refueling in Keflavik, Iceland,
without incident.

   Forget the $64,000 question. All of Florida and
beyond wants to know the $100 million answer - who picked the six
numbers in Saturday's drawing to win the nation's second largest
jackpot.
   Lotto fever pulled people to the state like a magnet last week.
On Saturday, officials reported people were spending hours in lines
outside convenience stores and other outlets, waiting to buy a
ticket they hope will make them an instant millionaire.
   ``There are a couple places, remote places, little
out-of-the-way places, where for whatever reason they don't have
long lines,'' said lottery spokesman Ed George, who considered a
Saturday line of 15 people short.
   As the minutes ticked toward the 10:30 p.m. sales deadline for
the 10:58 p.m. drawing, the enthusiasm kept building.
   ``Every time you turn on the news it's Lotto, Lotto, Lotto.
Everybody's talking about it,'' said Art Yandoc of Miami, who
bought 15 $1 tickets before playing tennis.
   The winning numbers drawn Saturday were: 6-35-34-45-21-5.
   Lottery officials won't know until Monday exactly how big the
jackpot will be, but George said, ``We're well on our way to paying
$100 million.''
   The jackpot has grown each of the last four weeks as no one has
picked all six winning numbers.
   But with so many people buying tickets, George said it's likely
the prize will be divided between several people holding winning
tickets this week. And officials didn't expect to know until Sunday
whether there were any winners.
   To win the jackpot, players must pick the six winning numbers
between 1 and 49 or have machines select them at random. The odds
of winning are 1 in 14 million.
   Florida's previous record Lotto prize was $58 million, split
between five winners in April. Pennsylvania's lottery produced the
nation's highest jackpot - $115 million - in April 1989.
   At a truck stop in Jennings, five miles from the Georgia border,
the wait for tickets lasted five hours and vehicles with license
plates from New York, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Louisiana and even
California were backed up on the Interstate 75 ramp.
   ``We do more lottery than diesel. The trucks can't get in
here,'' said Liz Burse, manager at Johnson and Johnson truck stop.
One bettor tried to jump into line and ``they nearly lynched him,''
she said.
   Florida laws limit lottery ticket sales to inside the state and
only through authorized retailers. At a Chevron station across from
Miami International Airport, taxis dropped off people who flew in
from such cities as Houston, St. Louis and New York.
   Some bettors were buying tickets by the hundreds or even
thousands.
   Bill Villafina of Kissimmee said he spent more than seven hours
purchasing tickets - all part of a plan to spend ``somewhere in the
neighborhood of $50,000,'' primarily for New Jersey relatives.
   About 175 employees at Jensen Corp., a Fort Lauderdale
restaurant and hospital equipment manufacturer, found a Lotto
ticket tucked into each of their paycheck envelopes Friday.
   ``It used to be said that the American dream was a good job,
owning your own home and a chicken in every pot,'' a company letter
said. ``Nowadays, the American dream is to win a state lottery.''

   Senate Judiciary Committee members on both
sides of the abortion issue have failed to extract from Supreme
Court nominee David Souter his view of how he would approach the
subject on the nation's highest court.
   But the responses from the New Hampshire judge could make either
side nervous.
   In his second day of testimony Friday, Souter denied he would
join the Supreme Court with any decision already made on
overturning the 1973 abortion rights ruling in Roe vs. Wade.
   ``I have not got any agenda on what should be done with Roe vs.
Wade. I would listen to both sides of that case. I have not made up
my mind,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Democrats are avoiding criticism of President
Bush's Persian Gulf policy while openly condemning his domestic
stands and his party's ``greed and debt.''
   Democratic Party leaders, meeting today uptown from the White
House, are formally endorsing Bush's decision to send troops to
block Iraq's aggression in the Middle East.
   But that backing for the Republican president doesn't extend to
his domestic policy, which the Democrats say characterize a
``decade of Republican greed and debt.''
   On the agenda for the meeting of the Democratic National
Committee were resolutions denouncing ``the failure of three
successive Republican administrations to develop a national energy
policy'' and blaming the GOP for the savings and loan crisis.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - More than tax increases and spending cuts are
at stake in the nearly `round-the-clock deficit-reduction
negotiations between congressional and Bush administration
officials.
   As they struggle to avert wholesale cuts in federal programs
next month, the president's aides and top members of Congress also
must decide how to divide targeted tax cuts that would cost more
than $20 billion over the next five years. The intended
beneficiaries include rich investors, giant corporations,
first-time homebuyers and workers pursuing employer-financed
educations.
   Most of a dozen tax benefits that expire this year enjoy wide
support in Congress and are backed by the administration. Thus,
their renewal is likely to be attached to any deficit package
approved by the negotiators. That package likely will be the only
tax bill passed this year.
   The fate of another big proposed tax cut - one that has been the
subject of a running battle between Congress and President Bush
since he took office - is far less certain. The administration
insists on including in the package a cut in the tax on capital
gains. But Democratic leaders are saying that can't be done unless
overall income tax rates on upper-income Americans are raised to
pay for it.

   CHICAGO (AP) - Jim Lord's basement is chock-full of
tractor-trailers, moving vans, dump trucks and gasoline tankers.
There's so many of them, the traffic jam has spread to his barn.
   At last count, the retired pipefitter had 2,700 toy trucks, but
not just any trucks. The ones Lord collects are reproductions of
big-name company haulers that can't be found in stores.
   Lord, 75, is one of about 4,000 enthusiasts to search out the
handcrafted gems made by Winross Co. for such companies as Exxon
Corp., the Adolph Coors Co. and Campbell Soup Co.
   ``You can't get them in stores, so we have to find out about
them via the grapevine,'' he said recently. ``It's really the
challenge of getting them that makes them so sought-after.''
   The 6-inch-long trucks are sold to companies by Winross, a
family-owned business in Rochester, N.Y., for about $30 dollars
each. They look like the companies' real trucks, logos included,
and are used as promotional giveaways.

   The United Auto Workers union and General Motors
Corp. recessed talks early Saturday on a national labor contract
and the union told its members not to strike.
   Negotiators had faced a midnight strike deadline. Talks were to
resume Saturday morning on a three-year contract for about 300,000
active GM workers in 29 states. The contract would serve as a model
for talks with other major automakers.
   ``GM thinks that meaningful progress has been made in the
current contract negotiations and that an agreement will be
reached,'' said a statement issued by GM Vice President Alfred S.
Warren Jr. ``Negotiators will continue efforts to achieve this
goal.''
   The latest bargaining session ended about 12:20 a.m.
   ``We are continuing our efforts to reach a settlement.'' UAW
Vice President Stephen Yokich said in a statement released about
10:45 p.m. ``UAW-represented workers have been advised to stay on
the job and report for work on their regular shift until further
notice.''
   Only GM's Bowling Green, Ky., assembly plant, which makes
Corvettes, was scheduled for production during the weekend. The
company's other 30 car and truck assembly plants are idle on
weekends.
   The UAW's contracts with GM, Ford and Chrysler Corp. expired at
midnight. They cover more than 450,000 active auto workers in the
United States and Wallaceburg, Ontario.
   In Toronto, the Canadian Auto Workers called a strike Friday
against Ford Motor Co.'s Canadian subsidiary after negotiators did
not meet a midnight deadline. Negotiators had reported talks were
progressing and bargaining was to resume Saturday. Ford plants in
Canada are closed weekends.
   It was the first Ford Canada strike since 1976. The CAW
represents about 12,800 Ford workers.
   The Canadian workers make a variety of components for Ford's
U.S. assembly plants. A strike in Canada would likely affect the
company's U.S. operations within a week.
   In the United States, the UAW chose on Aug. 28 to focus its
bargaining on GM. Talks with Ford and Chrysler have been put on
hold since. UAW leaders have said they plan to use a contract
ratified by GM workers as a pattern for agreements at Ford and
Chrysler.
   As the talks entered their final hours, unresolved issues
included job security, wages and pensions. Union leaders contacted
Friday said they were not told details about the unresolved issues.
   Tentative agreements had been reached on a variety of mostly
non-economic issues including health, safety and attendance policy.
   Dramatic changes in the auto industry during the 1980s,
especially the growth of Japanese automakers' shares of the U.S.
car and truck market, have affected labor relations between the UAW
and the Big Three in general and GM specifically.
   The Big Three's collective market share dropped about 6
percentage points during the decade to about 68 percent last year.
During the same time, the Japanese companies' share rose by about
the same amount to over 25 percent.
   That has forced GM, Ford and Chrysler to shrink their operations
and their work forces. In response, the UAW's primary emphasis has
shifted to job security from wage increases.
   As the companies worked to cut costs, they adopted a parts
delivery system called ``just-in-time.'' Under such a scheme,
automakers ship parts and component systems to assembly plants just
before they are needed, sometimes within hours of installation.
   At the same time, automakers consolidated manufacturing to
reduce redundancies and expenses.
   That opened a new strategy for the UAW - one whose effects were
shown last month.
   Because of just-in-time delivery, the UAW can shut down assembly
plants, some of which have more than 5,000 workers, by striking a
critical parts plant that employs far fewer people.
   Last month, the UAW struck GM's AC Rochester West parts plant in
Flint for six days over local issues, including an employment level
guarantee. Before the walkout ended, GM was forced to close seven
assembly plants because of parts shortages. Those shutdowns, in
turn, resulted in layoffs at other component plants.

   The New York Post got a temporary reprieve
Friday night when all but one of its unions agreed to concessions
designed to save the feisty but unprofitable tabloid.
   ``Ain't Over Yet'' declared Saturday's front page headline when
it rolled off the presses early Saturday, hours behind schedule.
Post Owner Peter Kalikow had threatened to close the paper after
Saturday's editions without the cuts.
   Ten unions at the paper agreed to concessions during marathon
negotiating sessions. Kalikow said he needed $19 million in
concessions to keep publishing the newspaper, the nation's oldest
continuously published daily. The paper is losing about $27 million
a year.
   The last union, The Newspaper Guild, will vote on his offer
Monday night, Kalikow said. The Guild represents 350 editorial and
advertising employees. The union's negotiating team voted 7-3
against the offer.
   ``I feel optimistic that when the members see it they will
approve it,'' Kalikow said of his offer.
   If the Guild members reject the offer, the Post will cease
publishing immediately, he said. The newspaper has a circulation of
505,000.
   ``It was the best offer we could make under the circumstances,''
he said.
   Barry Lipton, president of Local 3 of the Newspaper Guild, said
he recommended his members accept the package. Details were not
disclosed.
   ``It's up to the members. It's the very best we could do. ... I
hope that the sense of the membership is to swallow what may be a
bitter pill,'' he said.
   Members of each union must ratify the agreements, but it
appeared the Guild vote was the key because its negotiators didn't
support the pact.
   The reprieve was announced after talks stretched for more than
12 hours and passed two deadlines. The paper had planned to print
its history, including reminiscences of former employees, if
Saturday's edition was its last.
   ``It's a terrific farewell edition we prepared but hopefully
it'll never be read by the public,'' metropolitan editor John
Cotter said.
   Talks had resumed Friday morning between the paper and the Guild
and other unions representing more than 850 of the Post's 960
employees. The newspaper's contracts with the unions expire in
March 1991.
   Kalikow said the concessions included pay cuts and layoffs. He
said workers would be given stock in the newspaper under the
agreements.
   ``It was a bitter pill for these people to swallow but they
realized it was important to save the Post,'' he said.
   A source involved in the Guild negotiations, who requested
anonymity, said that the Post had roposed a cut of 43
Guild-covered jobs. Previously, the newspaper had favored pay cuts
rather than job cuts, while the union has called for attrition
through resignations and buyouts.
   The situation was complicated by the plight of the Daily News,
which also is losing money, and which also is in the midst of a
labor conflict. News executives say any concessions the unions give
the Post must also be given the News under ``me-too'' contract
clauses.
   And The New York Times said it would seek union concessions to
the extent that they were related to the same economic conditions
that have affected the Post and News and led to declines in the
papers' ad revenue.
   Money troubles are not new to the Post - even its founder had
them. Alexander Hamilton was heavily in debt in 1801 when he
persuaded a group of merchants to finance the paper.
   His was merely the first of many famous names to be associated
with the paper.
   In the 1820s, New England poet William Cullen Bryant began a
50-year tenure as editor. Poet Walt Whitman covered the Civil War
for the Post. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was briefly a co-owner in
the 1920s.
   Heiress Dorothy Schiff bought the Post in 1939 and tried to
attract more readers with comics, features, a tabloid format,
strong sports stories and nearly 50 columnists.
   Schiff also made the paper one of the nation's most liberal. Her
self-described formula: ``honest unionism, social reform and humane
government programs.''
   But the humane reformer also was a bit tightfisted. The Post
became known for making do with a small staff and old equipment.
   By the mid-1970s, much of the Post's liberal, middle-class
readership had moved to the suburbs. In 1976, Schiff sold the paper
to Australian media baron Rupert Murdoch for $31 million. At the
time the paper was losing $500,000 annually.
   Under Murdoch, the Post took on a conservative voice and began
dishing out sexy pictures, racy headlines - including the famous
``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR'' - and a steady diet of crime
stories.
   Murdoch said the paper lost $150 million before he sold it in
1988 for $37 million to Kalikow, a real estate developer who also
acquired the paper's valuable waterfront land on South Street in
Lower Manhattan.

   The Canadian Auto Workers union called a strike
against Ford Motor Co. of Canada on Friday after negotiators
decided they could not meet a midnight deadline for settling all
the issues.
   ``At midnight tonight, we will be commencing the first strike we
have had against Ford of Canada since 1976,'' CAW President Robert
White said late Friday.
   ``We still have a very significant distance between the two
positions,'' Don MacKenzie, Ford's chief negotiator, told reporters
as discussions broke off for the day at a downtown Toronto hotel.
   Despite the strike announcement, both sides said talks would
resume Saturday.
   Earlier Friday, union and company officials had agreed
communication was good and that work was progressing toward a new
contract. But White had acknowledged it was virtually impossible to
get everything done by the midnight Friday strike deadline.
   ``It would take a miracle to get all the work that has to be
done finished before midnight,'' he had said.
   Up to 12,800 workers are expected to walk off the job at nine
plants and two offices in Ontario. The company has two plants in
Oakville, five in Windsor, one in St. Thomas and one in Niagara
Falls.
   However, the strike won't mean anything in terms of production
until Monday because Canadian Ford plants do not operate on the
weekend.
   In Detroit, the United Auto Workers union and General Motors
Corp. agreed to extend their national labor contract Friday, hours
before the same midnight strike deadline as in Canada, local union
leaders said.
   ``They're going to negotiate through the weekend,'' said Charlie
Gledhill, acting president of UAW 549 at GM's metal stamping plant
in Mansfield, Ohio. ``We're not going to walk out tonight.''
   Those talks recessed early Saturday and were expected to
continue later in the day.
   In both countries, the unions target a single company in their
talks in hopes of fashioning a pattern contract for workers at
other automakers.
   White said his union's decision to target Ford instead of
General Motors like his counterparts in the United States has
proved to be the correct move. He said the CAW now has the full
attention of Ford and its top officials. If the Canadian union had
decided to strike GM, the efforts and attention of company
officials would be focused on the U.S. negotiations.
   The CAW has a $34 million strike fund to support a walkout.
   White said earlier in the day that Ford had not made a new
economic proposal since the first one put on the table a few days
ago, which the union found unacceptable. He said the CAW had
presented Ford with a counterproposal early Friday and that Ford
officials went off to calculate the numbers.
   Ford Canada spokesman Jim Hartford confirmed that, but said he
did not know how long it would take Ford to work out the cost of
the union proposal.
   Neither side offered details of the proposals. Both sides had
indicated progress had been made in some areas.
   After announcing the strike late Friday, White said the tough
issues were job security, inflation, and time off. ``Ford is
balking at putting enough economics on the table to get an
agreement,'' he said.
   The Canadian branch of the American car giant is suffering from
flagging sales, down 6.4 percent in August from a year ago,
according to Hartford.
