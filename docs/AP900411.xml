   A car bomb exploded on a busy highway in
Medellin as a police anti-drug patrol was passing Wednesday,
killing 16 people and wounding at least 73, authorities said.
   Ten vehicles and surrounding buildings were badly damaged,
officials reported from that northern city, home of the notorious
Medellin drug cartel.
   No one claimed responsibility, but drug traffickers have been
killing police officers in Medellin in retaliation for the
government's anti-drug campaign.
   In Bogota, the news program TV Hoy reported late Wednesday that
according to senior police sources, the attack was ordered by
Medellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar. The TV program quoted police
as saying without elaborating that they had irrefutible evidence of
Escobar's involvement.
   National police declared a state of alert late Wednesday. A
communique by the Bogota headquarters said more attacks might be
planned.
   Eight police and eight civilians were killed in the attack
Wednesday, said Carlos Palacios, a spokesman for the government in
the southern Medellin suburb of Itagui.
   The police officers attacked belonged to an elite unit charged
with battling terrorism by drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas.
The force has received training in Colombia from U.S. and British
security personnel in recent months.
   There were conflicting reports of wounded. Radio reports placed
the number at 109 while the police spokesman reported 73. The
police spokesman, who refused to identify himself, said 60
civilians and 13 police officers were injured.
   Palacios said many of the wounded were in critical condition. He
said children were among the victims.
   The bomb, packing 220 pounds of dynamite, targeted a police
patrol traveling on the highway leading to Itagui, a Medellin
police spokesman said.
   The police revised the amount of dynamite down from their
initial report of 440 pounds.
   The chief of Medellin's fire department, Carlos Correa, said in
a radio interview by the RCN network that the blast wrecked nine
other vehicles along with the truck carrying police to their posts.
   The attack on a busy highway came as thousands of Colombians
were driving out of the city to begin Holy Week vacations. Radio
reports said the blast left a 7-foot-deep hole in the highway.
   ``Everyone here felt the blast,'' Palacios said in a radio
interview from the Itagui municipal government offices near the
site of the bombing. He said the blast ``caused the earth and
nearby buildings to shake.''
   In the port of Cartagena, President Virgilio Barco said he was
``sorry to receive such bad news.'' His brief comment was broadcast
by RCN.
   Before Wednesday, gunmen working for the Medellin cartel had
killed 19 police officers and a soldier in less than two weeks in
Medellin, Colombia's second most populous city with 2 million
residents.
   Authorities say the drug chiefs have offered to pay $4,300 for
each police officer killed in the city, hub of Colombia's cocaine
trade.
   The cartel claims that members detained by police in Medellin
have been tortured and killed, a charge the government denies.
   On April 5, police defused a 1,650-pound dynamite bomb packed in
a truck and abandoned on a main Bogota avenue. Police blamed the
Medellin cartel for the truck bomb.
   The traffickers said in a communique Friday that they would step
up their war against police and the country's political and
business elite.
   The cartel pledged more bombings and killings in response to
police's alleged torture and killing of traffickers.
   An earlier communique by the cartel threatened more attacks in
retaliation for government refusal to abandon its policy of
extraditing drug suspects.
   The Barco administration has sent 15 drug suspects to the United
States for trial since intensifying a campaign against traffickers
in August.
   More than 200 people have died in drug-related violence since
the government launched the U.S.-backed campaign against cocaine
cartels. The crackdown came after traffickers killed a leading
presidential candidate.
   In December, traffickers exploded a 1,100-pound truck bomb at
the secret police headquarters in Bogota, the capital. The blast
killed 63 people.
   Also Wednesday, the Valle state government reported the bodies
of 14 people kidnapped in a southwestern town were found in a river
near Obando, about 185 miles west of Bogota.
   The victims had been kidnapped in Trujillo, 37 miles south of
Obando on March 1, after an attack by a leftist guerrilla group on
a military patrol.
   Six soldiers died in the attack by the National Liberation Army.
   The army blamed the rebel group for the kidnappings. But
guerrillas said in a communique that a right-wing death squad was
responsible.
   Many of the country's death squads are financed by drug
traffickers.

<HEAD>Justice Department May Freeze Assets of Some S&amp;Ls, Officers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is considering freezing
assets of savings and loans and S&amp;L officers accused of fraud, but
most of the cases already under investigation won't be affected.
   The authority to freeze the funds was included in last year's
S&amp;L bailout bill passed by Congress, Justice spokesman David Runkel
said Tuesday. It became effective on Aug. 10.
   Because the bill is not retroactive, however, the fraud or other
wrongdoing must have been committed after that date for assets to
be frozen, Runkel said.
   Thus far, no ``appropriate cases'' have been found, since most
of the cases being scrutinized by the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force
concern ``allegations of wrongdoing that go back several years,''
the spokesman said.
   Nevertheless, he said, a large number of cases remain under
investigation.
   ``I can't tell you that this is going to lead to substantial
sums being attached. But it's a possibility,'' Runkel said. ``And
it's something we're looking at, exploring, for possible use.''
   The freezing of assets would be done before a final court
judgment is entered on criminal or civil cases and ``would prevent
assets from being dissipated'' as the legal process is carried out,
he said.
   ``We would have them, so that they would be available for
recapture'' by the government after a verdict, he said.
   The announcement came about a month after a House subcommittee
chairman said thousands of S&amp;L fraud investigations were not being
actively pursued for lack of money.
   The S&amp;L legislation enacted in August authorized $75 million for
pursuing bank and thrift embezzlement this year, but the
administration sought and received only $49.2 million in actual
appropriations from Congress, said Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga.
   He said 2,327 cases of financial institution fraud and
embezzlement were inactive, meaning they were open but not being
pursued. Of those, 1,298 are considered major cases involving
losses of $100,000 or more, Barnard told his House Government
Operations subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs.
   Justice spokesman Doug Tillett said at the time, ``We are
putting every penny ... to work on the problem.''
   The slew of Texas S&amp;L cases and the vast amount of money lost
prompted the Justice Department to turn to the new method of
gaining funds.
   Throughout the S&amp;L scandal, the government has found that the
assets have disappeared before they can be retrieved, Runkel said.
   ``Out of the Dallas bank task force, we've had $12.5 million in
recovery. ... And the alleged illegal activities and the cost to
the taxpayers has been substantially more than that, in the
hundreds of millions of dollars, out of the Dallas cases alone,''
Runkel said.
   ``What happens is that the assets are not there following a
conviction,'' he said.
   The Dallas task force has brought charges against 62 people, of
whom 49 have been convicted, the Justice Department said. Criminal
fines against the 49 total $574,850, and restitution orders total
$11.9 million.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh met Tuesday with Timothy Ryan,
who was sworn in Monday as the director of the Treasury
Department's Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Representatives of the two will meet later this week ``to
develop specific plans to ensure the most efficient use of the
resources provided'' by Congress, Runkel said.
   The day before the announcement, the administration acknowledged
that its $50 billion savings and loan bailout will not be enough. A
congressional report has said costs could reach $500 billion if the
economy falters. That estimate includes the government's borrowing
expenses over 40 years.

<HEAD>Air Space Over Seven Cities Gets Pilots' ``Black Star'' Rating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pilots are complaining about air safety
conditions over seven U.S. cities, but the Federal Aviation
Administration says test air traffic control rules have caused ``no
accidents and no close calls.''
   The Air Line Pilots Association announced Tuesday that air space
over Charlotte, N.C.; Cleveland, Dallas-Fort Worth, Los Angeles,
Memphis, Philadelphia and Phoenix has been added to the
international ``black star'' list of airports and air space that
could pose problems for pilots.
   Only one other U.S. site is among 24 locations on the list _ the
Cyril E. King International Airport in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin
Islands. Surrounding terrain requires special training and no night
flights, according to pilot groups.
   ALPA announced the designations after the International
Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations added the seven U.S. air
spaces to its list.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the pilots' complaints arise from
a test air traffic control procedure used since 1987 at the seven
cities.
   In 20 other sectors over the busiest U.S. airports, controllers
must maintain a separation of three miles between all aircraft. At
the seven cities, Farrar said, controllers under limited
circumstances need not comply with the set separation between
aircraft as long as they are kept safely apart.
   ``In two years, there have been no accidents and no close
calls,'' Farrar said.
   The new standard for the seven cities has been used in the vast
air spaces between airports for six years, also without any
accidents or close calls, he said.
   The procedure is only allowed during clear weather when one
plane is flying by instruments and the pilot of the second plane is
relying on what he sees out the window, Farrar said.
   ALPA said the ``black star'' designation does not indicate
unsafe conditions but is viewed as ``a serious deficiency in our
nation's aviation safety structure'' about which unfamiliar pilots
should be warned.
   ``The added risks, coupled with the inability to measure any
gains in efficiency, make this a highly questionable exercise by
the FAA,'' said ALPA President Henry Duffy.
   He said the FAA benefits from the new system because it reduces
the number of reportable operational errors, making the skies
appear to be safer. No longer do all violations of the three-mile
separation have to be reported, he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush-Gorbachev Summit Likely to be One-Site
Affair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
weighted down by the crisis in Lithuania and other restive Soviet
republics, is resisting proposals from President Bush for a
multi-site U.S. summit, administration officials say.
   The Soviets have given a polite ``nyet'' to White House
suggestions that part of the May 30-June 3 summit be held at Bush's
oceanside vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, said officials who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Chances are that Gorbachev, who doesn't share Bush's love for
ocean power boating, had his fill of waves and spray at their last
meeting in December _ aboard the Soviet liner Maxim Gorki, tied up
at Malta dock in a Mediterranean gale.
   Also not in the cards: a joint Bush-Gorbachev appearance at the
May 31 commencement at West Point. Bush was scheduled to give the
keynote address and speculation grew that he might show up with
Gorbachev in tow.
   Administration officials said they have ruled out any such joint
appearance and expect that Bush will have to cancel his own
participation because of the summit.
   Lack of Soviet feedback on summit logistics is frustrating
planning for the superpower meeting that begins seven weeks from
today, the officials said.
   The upshot is that the summit probably will be held almost
entirely in Washington, with a visit to the presidential retreat in
Camp David, Md., likely to be the only side trip, the sources said.
   ``It's going to be a working visit; no time for sightseeing,''
Gennadi Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
pointedly.
   Still, Bush has a record of conducting meetings with foreign
leaders in picturesque _ or at least interesting _ places and
taking them to sporting events.
   Malta is a hard locale to beat, at least in photogenic terms.
But Bush plans another island session this weekend when he meets
with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Bermuda.
   He conferred with French President Francois Mitterrand last
December on the French Caribbean island of St. Martin, and meets
with him again later this month in Key Largo, Fla. He has also had
Mitterrand to Kennebunkport.
   For his summit last month with Japan's Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu, Bush selected a posh desert country club near Palm Springs,
Calif.
   He also likes to take foreign leaders to baseball games,
although the White House says there are no particular plans for a
Bush-Gorbachev outing to the ballpark.
   Bush joined Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Tuesday
evening for a game in the sprawling Toronto SkyDome. And a year
ago, he took Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to a Baltimore
Orioles game. Mubarak had never seen a baseball game before and he
seemed baffled.
   Of course, with Gorbachev, anything is possible. Just like Bush,
he has a history of surprise moves at summits.
   For instance, the last time he was in Washington in December
1987 he abruptly stopped his motorcade several blocks from the
White House, got out and greeted people on the street.
   Bush no doubt remembers that event all too well. Then-Vice
President Bush was in an accompanying limousine and seemed at a
loss to know what to do as Gorbachev worked the delighted crowd.
   He sat passively in his car for several minutes. Then, as
Gorbachev was preparing to leave, Bush got out of his limo, stood
by it and waved to the crowd.
   Gorbachev also maintained his own agenda while in Washington,
meeting with various interest groups and members of Congress _ all
without advance notice to the Reagan administration.
   White House officials are not ruling out such surprises at next
month's summit _ either from Bush or from Gorbachev.
   However, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater suggests that some of the
drama has left such summits because of the frequency of U.S.-Soviet
summits in the six years since Gorbachev came to power and because
of dramatic changes in the communist world.
   ``I think we've long since passed the point where you can only
meet if you have a treaty to sign,'' he said.

<HEAD>Training of New Auditors Causes Lost Revenues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An effort to boost tax collections by hiring
more auditors is backfiring in the short run because senior agents
who should be auditing returns are training new employees instead,
a congressional study says.
   In just five of the 63 Internal Revenue Service districts, the
General Accounting Office estimated, the diversion of auditors to
train new agents will cost the government $980 million in lost
taxes.
   If the other districts had similar experiences, the loss could
hit $6.5 billion before the training begins to pay off.
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said the government
lost more than $1 million in taxes over the short run for each new
worker who completed a 26-month training course.
   The IRS conducted a similar study using different methods and
came up with a lower figure for lost taxes.
   ``No matter whose methodology is used, the conclusion is the
same: unrealized audit revenues associated with training new
revenue agents have been substantial,'' wrote Jennie S. Stathis,
tax policy director for the GAO.
   The GAO study covered agents who were hired between July 1,
1986, and Sept. 30, 1988, most of them as part of an effort by
Congress to raise the number of tax returns that are audited. The
audit rate has declined steadily for several years, from 150 per
10,000 returns in 1983 to an expected 92 per 10,000 this year.
   Ellen Murphy, IRS public affairs director, noted Tuesday that
the IRS has been under a hiring freeze and has hired no new
auditors over the past two years.
   ``We don't believe there will be future revenue losses from this
training factor,'' Ms. Murphy said. ``When we resume hiring ... we
will be doing a lot more of on-line training _ reserving intensive
classroom training for contractors _ ... and having trainees go
with experienced auditors to see how the job should be done.''
   The $6.1 billion IRS budget that President Bush has proposed for
fiscal 1991 would allow the agency to add 2,400 auditors to the
16,000 now on its staff.
   The GAO report indicated it will take as long as four years for
an earlier effort to pay off. It will take that long for tax
collections to rise enough to offset the costs of hiring new agents
_ and the revenue lost by having them trained by senior auditors.
   Once an auditor is fully trained, however, the payoff for tax
collections is significant. The GAO estimated that senior auditors
in the IRS' Dallas office recommended additional taxes and
penalties averaging $5,155 for each hour they spent auditing
returns. The Los Angeles average was $4,572; Chicago, $3,777;
Atlanta, $3,273, and San Francisco, $3,032.
   During the 1986-1988 period checked, the IRS hired 7,300 people
for the job of revenue agent, whose chief task is to audit more
complicated returns, including those filed by large corporations.
The five offices that the GAO surveyed hired 1,103, or 15 percent,
of that number.
   The study found that 69 percent of the training assignments for
those new employees were carried out by agents who had been
auditing returns at the time they were selected.
   As of last June 30, the use of auditors to train the 1,103 new
workers had deprived the government of about $840 million in
revenues that the interrupted audits would have produced, the GAO
estimated. The total could rise to $980 million by the time all the
new employees complete their training.
   Only 179 of the 1,103 new employees had completed all four
phases of training, and the revenue loss was estimated at more than
$1.04 million for each trainee who completed the course. The GAO
said 848 of the 1,103 new hires were still with the IRS at that
time.

<HEAD>Chippewas Open Spearfishing Season Amid Taunts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT IMRIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STAR PRAIRIE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-Indian taunts and posters greeted
supporters of tribal treaty rights Tuesday night at a lake where a
band of Chippewas prepared to open the tribal spearfishing season.
   An estimated 350 supporters and opponents of Chippewa
spearfishing gathered at Cedar Lake in northwestern Wisconsin amid
tight security.
   More than 100 law enforcement officials, including more than two
dozen in riot gear, were at a boat landing at the lake. The lake
was the only one the St. Croix Chippewas had said they would fish.
Many other northern lakes remain covered by ice.
   When members of the American Indian Movement arrived beating a
drum in support of Chippewa spearfishing, the crowd swelled around
them and taunts were exchanged.
   ``Red, black and white, spearing ain't right,'' some said.
   ``Save the walleye, spear the Indian,'' one man shouted.
   Posters held by those in the crowd had such messages as: ``You
have shamed every Native American that ever lived;'' ``Equal
rights, not treaty rights;'' and ``Walleye or welfare, make a
choice.''
   Kevin Wakefield of Star Prairie said he came to the boat landing
for the first time because Indian spearfishing must stop.
   ``They are spearing the walleye out of the lakes. It is just
take, take, take,'' Wakefield said.
   Some AIM members photograped the crowd, which adults and
children.
   It was not clear, however, if there had been any fishing. Polk
County Sheriff Ben Ware said he understood one boat of spearers
went out, but state spokesman Jeff Welch said he understood there
had been no spearfishing.
   The St. Croix band, one of six Chippewa bands in Wisconsin, has
been authorized to take 2,102 walleye from off-reservation lakes
over the course of the spearfishing season that usually lasts three
weeks, said tribal chairman Ed Bearheart.
   Before going to the lake, about 100 spearfishing supporters
signed a pledge of peace and donned armbands, said Barb Kass of
Luck, coordinator for the treaty support group Witnesses for
Non-violence.
   About 25 representatives of the Minneapolis-based AIM, including
founder Clyde Bellecourt, attended a rally at the St. Croix band's
community center before heading to the lake.
   Since 1983, federal courts have upheld 19th century treaties
giving the Chippewa the right to hunt, fish and harvest timber on
off-reservation lands in the northern third of Wisconsin.
   Tensions between Chippewa spearers and non-Indian critics have
grown each year since 1985, when the Indians renewed active
spearfishing. A year ago, 271 spearers caught 16,000 walleye.
   Demonstrations last year opposing Indian spearfishing, mostly
near the Lac du Flambeau Reservation, escalated into incidents
involving rock-throwing and racial slurs. More than 200 people were
arrested.
   State and tribal leaders have urged supporters and opponents of
Indian spearfishing to stay away from boat landings this spring.

<TEXT>
   The hit ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' will
come out of their shells even more next fall when they join CBS'
Saturday morning lineup.
   Judy Price, CBS' vice president for children's programs,
announced Tuesday that the network bought rights to 26 original
half-hour ``Turtles'' cartoon episodes, none of which have
previously appeared in a separate 65-episode package syndicated
last year to local TV stations for weekday broadcasts.
   The cartoon turtles are ``the hottest thing going now,'' Price
said. A live-action movie version also is a box-office hit,
grossing more than $50 million in only two weeks.
   Price said CBS signed an option for the shows last fall, and
``the movie has been the frosting on the cake.''
   CBS' shows, produced by the same company that makes the
syndicated version, will appear as a one-hour program, consisting
of two half-hour episodes that complement each other's story lines,
she said.
   Price said she was unconcerned that, with five weekdays of
turtles on TV, their addition to CBS' Saturday schedule would
eventually leave young viewers all turtled out.
   ``In fact, quite the opposite has happened,'' she said. She
cited as an example CBS' ``Muppet Babies,'' which also is
syndicated for weekday broadcast, and still is doing well in its
sixth season on CBS.
   It's been shown that children prefer the familiar on TV, she
said, while it's difficult to lure them to the new and different:
``The things that get sampled are the known things, the
comfortable.''
   The only other new series in CBS' Saturday schedule is ``Bill &amp;
Ted's Excellent Adventure.'' Based on the movie of the same name,
the half-hour show is about two teen-agers traveling through time,
aided by a hipster whose voice is that of comic George Carlin.
   CBS' turtles purchase had been expected by many in the TV
industry. It came as CBS became the last of the networks to unveil
its fall lineup for Saturday mornings, an increasingly competitive
arena in broadcast and cable TV.
   Unlike NBC, which on Monday said it was dropping such old
cartoon reliables as ``ALF'' and ``The Smurfs'' and bringing in the
most live-action children's programming in its history, CBS' new
schedule remains predominantly animated.
   CBS axed ``California Raisins,'' ``Dungeons and Dragons'' and
``The Adventures of Raggedy Ann and Andy,'' but is bringing back
``Garfield,'' ``Muppet Babies,'' ``Dink, The Little Dinosaur'' and
``CBS Storybreak.''
   Its new schedule has only one live-action show, the partly
animated ``Pee-Wee's Playhouse,'' a ratings success returning for a
fifth season.
   Price said ``animation is the most tested and true form for
Saturday mornings.''
   ``One thing you have to remember: children are exposed to live
action seven days a week,'' she added, asserting that contrary to
commonly held beliefs, cartoons only account for ten percent of
childrens' total TV viewing.

   State Treasurer Ann Richards defeated
Attorney General Jim Mattox on Tuesday to claim the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination after a down-and-dirty runoff that dwelled
on allegations of drug use and dishonesty.
   Ms. Richards, who became the first woman in Texas to win either
party's nomination since Democratic Gov. Miriam ``Ma'' Ferguson in
1932, will duel with Republican oilman-rancher Clayton Williams in
November.
   ``I want you to rejoice and I want you to celebrate tonight
because this is a fantastic win,'' Ms. Richards told cheering
supporters at her Austin election night headquarters. But she said
Democrats must unite quickly to defeat Williams.
   ``I want you to remember that there were other people in this
primary who did not support our cause, who supported someone else
and who felt strongly that they were doing the right thing. And it
is time now that we reach out to them and tell them that we must be
unified,'' she said.
   With 90 percent of the precincts reporting, Ms. Richards, the
1988 Democratic National Convention keynote speaker, had 571,742
votes, or 56.2 percent, to Mattox's 445,403, or 43.8 percent.
   Mattox's loss was his first since losing a 1966 bid for
Democratic precinct chairman by three votes.
   ``I have never made a concession speech before in my life but
tonight I feel I must,'' Mattox said, adding that he would work for
the party in the fall.
   ``I want to send a sincere congratulations to Ann Richards.
Tomorrow I will be ready to help her up and down the state against
the common enemy and the common enemy is Clayton Williams. That's
spelled with all dollars and no sense,'' he said.
   Ms. Richards and Mattox, 46, were the top two vote-getters in
the March 13 primary.

   The incumbent, Republican Gov. Bill Clements, 72, is not seeking
re-election.
   Mattox's and Ms. Richards' mean-spirited runoff race, which
included charges of drug use leveled against both candidates,
wrapped up with each decrying the way the four-week battle unfolded.
   Ms. Richards accused Mattox of profiting from public service and
challenged him to release his income tax returns.
   Mattox alleged that Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, used
illegal drugs, including cocaine, 10 years ago and challenged her
to release medical records from her alcoholism treatment in 1980.
   The last week of the campaign brought newspaper reports that
Mattox was seen smoking marijuana in the mid-1970s and that Ms.
Richards was seen in a restroom where marijuana was allegedly being
smoked in 1979. Both dismissed the reports.
   ``It's been a very unpleasant campaign. It hasn't been good for
any of us,'' Ms. Richards said Monday.
   Ms. Richards, 56, won her first bid for public office when she
was elected a Travis County commissioner in 1976. She went on to
win two terms as state treasurer, in 1982 and 1986.
   Mattox won elections to the Texas House in 1972, to Congress in
1976, and as state attorney general in 1982. He won re-election in
1986.
   With both candidates considered liberal Democrats, there weren't
many issues on which they disagreed, although Mattox tried to cast
himself as the more conservative.
   Mattox made adoption of a state lottery his key issue, saying
the game could generate $700 million or more a year without new
taxes.
   Ms. Richards' said her campaign was for a ``New Texas,'' with
improved education, the economy and the environment her top
priorities.

<HEAD>`Twin Peaks' Wins Time Period in Nielsen Ratings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ABC's ``America's Funniest Home Videos''
maintained its viewer appeal in the latest Nielsen ratings and the
second-place network's much-heralded premiere of ``Twin Peaks''
also scaled to lofty heights.
   The new nighttime soap opera that chronicles sex, violence, junk
food and power in a small Washington state lumber town was the No.
5 show, according to the latest A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings released
Tuesday.
   Back-to-back episodes of ``America's Funniest Home Videos,''
pairing an original show with a repeat, ranked first and tied for
second with NBC's ``Cheers.''
   It's against ``Cheers'' that ``Twin Peaks'' must compete when
the new show created by David Lynch assumes its regular time slot
at 9 p.m. Thursday.
   The highly rated ``Cheers'' is part of NBC's blockbuster
Thursday line-up that includes ``The Cosby Show,'' which ranked
fourth for the week ended April 8, and ``A Different World,'' which
placed seventh.
   The No. 6 slot belonged to Monday night's showdown between the
University of Nevada-Las Vegas and Duke University for the college
basketball crown.
   Although it hardly ranked as drama, with Las Vegas routing the
Blue Devils 103-73, the matchup of straight-laced Duke and Jerry
Tarkanian's glitter city rebels apparently enticed viewers.
   ``Carol &amp; Co.,'' featuring Carol Burnett and an ensemble cast,
was in 10th place after premiering two weeks ago on NBC.
   Mid-season replacements ``Bagdad Cafe,'' starring Whoopi
Goldberg and Jean Stapleton on CBS and the highly publicized
``Equal Justice,'' on ABC, ranked 36th and 40th, respectively.
   For the week, NBC was back in first place with a 13.7 average,
followed by ABC with 12.8, and CBS with 11.6. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.
   In the previous Nielsen poll, ABC's 3{-hour Oscar broadcast had
helped to push NBC out of the top spot it had occupied for 23 weeks.
   The Top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``America's Funniest
Home Videos,'' ABC, 22.3; ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' and
``Cheers,'' NBC, tied for second with 21.9; ``The Bill Cosby
Show,'' NBC, 21.8; ``Twin Peaks,'' ABC, 21.7; NCAA Basketball
Championship, CBS, 20; ``A Different World,'' NBC, 19.7; ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' NBC,18.6; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 18.4 and ``Carol &amp; Co.,
NBC, 17.5.
   Fox's Sunday night comedy block continued to pull in viewers,
with ``The Simpsons'' ranking 31st with 13.2, and ``Married ...
With Children'' snagging 21st place with 14.5.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight with Peter Jennings'' was the No. 1
network news show with a 10.2 in average ratings. ``NBC Nightly
News'' and ``The CBS Evening News'' tied for second place with 8.9.

<HEAD>Police, Elementary School Students Clash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 elementary school students protesting
the firing of their principal clashed with stick-wielding police
Tuesday, and several were injured, marking the second such incident
this year, school officials said.
   Five students aged 11 to 13 suffered bruises and cuts in the
incident in front of the Morrill Elementary School on the city's
Southwest Side, officials at the school said.
   Several parents charged that officers used unnecessary force in
breaking up the protest. Police spokeswoman Tina Vicini said no one
was arrested and no student was seriously injured.
   Officers had been called to help school officials get the
students back into the building, said Principal Eduardo Cadavid.
   ``I guess they thought we weren't going fast enough, so they hit
a whole bunch of kids,'' said student Charity Kinney.
   School official Sharon Hayes said she went outside and noticed
an officer with a stick.
   ``I told him I thought we could handle this without sticks,''
she said. ``He started screaming and hollering, and putting his
stick in my face. He told me he knew what his job was.''
   Teacher Margaret Scott said police came into her classroom and
threatened students. She did not elaborate.
   ``My children were frightened to death,'' she said.
   For the past several weeks, students have been protesting the
local school council's refusal to renew Cadavid's contract.
   Principal firings have stirred protests at other Chicago schools
in recent months since the Chicago School Reform Act went into
effect at the start of the year. It set up parent-led locals
councils with authority to hire and fire.
   The other police-student clash occurred last month at Morgan
Park High School, when several students were arrested.

   Want to follow a pro around the golf
course without leaving the living room? Join in a game show?
   For the next five weeks, television watchers in some
southwestern Massachusetts households get to do just that as part
of a national test of new ``interactive television'' technology.
   ``It gets the couch potato a half-step up off the couch,'' said
Brian Lambert, general manager of Continental Cablevision, which is
beaming the program to 300 subscribers.
   The development is part of long-promised changes for television,
cable officials said.
   ``We keep hoping for these things. I think this is one of the
neater presentations I've seen, frankly,'' said Wendell Bailey,
vice president for science and technology at the National Cable
Television Association.
   Interactive television has been around for some time, starting
with a two-way television experiment Warner Amex Cable
Communications Inc. tested in Ohio in 1981. What makes the
Springfield tests different, cable officials said, is the level of
technological reliability and viewer participation.
   ``Being able to manipulate that television, to be the director,
to be able to select camera angles or answer questions or respond
to certain criteria really adds a whole new dimension to watching
television,'' Lambert said Tuesday, about three weeks into the
eight-week test of the cable technology developed by ACTV Domestic
Corp. of New York.
   The ACTV system is ``sort of multiple-choice TV,'' said Gary
Arlen, publisher of the trade newsletter, Interactivity Report.
   Later this month when a live golf tournament is broadcast, ACTV
viewers will be able to pick who they want to follow around the
course, choosing from a list flashed up before play begins. Then,
during the broadcast, the viewer can switch at any time to the
camera trained on that player, said Steven Georgeou, of Geocom
Consulting, a marketing consultant to ACTV.
   Viewers also will be able to punch up instant replays and
statistical information on selected players.
   Tuesday morning, while watching the game show ``College All
Stars,'' viewers at home were able to make their own choices. A
correct answer brought congratulations from the host. When the
viewer was wrong, the host commiserated.
   ``The whole purpose is to find out what people think of this
kind of technology and what kind of programs do they want to see,''
Georgeou said.``We also want to understand how many times people
want to push buttons.''
   So far, consumers have responded positively to the free test,
Lambert said.
   ACTV options are installed through a ``Smart Box,'' which is a
little larger than the regular cable converter box. The cost of the
service probably would be about $10 a month, Georgeou said.
   Whether ACTV becomes a regular fixture will depend on whether
sponsors can be persuaded there is consumer demand for interactive
television, cable officials said.

   Nearly 50 years ago, broadcaster Eric
Sevareid saw Ronald Reagan on a Warner Bros. movie lot and
immediately identified him as ``Mr. America.''
   It was 1941, and as a reporter for then fledgling CBS News,
Sevareid also met Warner Bros. stars like Gary Cooper and Marlene
Dietrich. But Reagan most impressed him, Sevareid recalled Monday
night in a speech at Central Missouri State University.
   ``You could see immediately he was the Eagle Scout, Mr.
America,'' Sevareid said.
   In the White House, 40 years later, Reagan's appeal ``did prove
to be almost irresistible for quite some time,'' Sevareid said, in
remarks concerning the relationship between the presidency and the
press.
   ``I think he did make most people feel better,'' although by his
second term Reagan had nothing new to offer, Sevareid said.
   Sevareid's son, Michael, is an adjunct lecturer and graduate
student at Central Missouri.

   Ivana Trump's lawyers are asking court
permission to question Marla Maples and dozens of Donald Trump's
associates as they add another swirl to the Trump divorce potboiler.
   Her lawyers also are asking judge Phyllis Gangel-Jacob to force
Trump to limit the documents he is demanding that his wife turn
over in her lawsuit to invalidate the couple's postnuptial
agreements.
   Among the items his lawyers have asked for are those relating to
``any threats made or undue influence practiced'' by Trump on his
wife, all his wife's personal diaries since 1976 and all ``letters,
memos, notes and greeting cards'' from him to her.
   Mrs. Trump's lawyers filed suit last month challenging Trump's
claim that she waived her right to half his estimated $5 billion
fortune in a series of postnuptial agreements, the last signed in
1987.
   She alleged in the court papers that Trump intimidated and
``verbally assaulted'' her and repeatedly cheated on her. She also
charged her attorney for the agreements was chosen by Trump's
lawyer at the time, the late Roy Cohn, and did not act in her best
interests.
   Trump's attorneys say the agreement, which gives Mrs. Trump $10
million and their $12 million mansion in Greenwich, Conn., is
ironclad.
   Mrs. Trump's spokesman, John Scanlon, said Tuesday that after
Mrs. Trump gives her deposition, Trump will have to give his, and
Mrs. Trump also will ask court permission to question 40 other
people _ including Miss Maples, the woman with whom Trump has been
linked.
   Jay Goldberg, one of Trump's attorneys, said the documents his
client is seeking would ``demonstrate without question the
infirmity of her claim.''
   He dismissed her plans to call Miss Maples as posturing.
   The hearing on Mrs. Trump's motion is scheduled for May 1.

   Dan Miller, who spent the past 15 months
as Pat Sajak's announcer and late-night sidekick, says the canceled
talk show just never found its identity.
   ``We tried to play it safe,'' said Miller, who was an anchorman
at WSMV in Nashville when Sajak was a weatherman at the station
from 1972 to 1975.
   ``It never found its own identity,'' Miller said this week. ``We
were trying to take ourselves too seriously.''
   There's no hard feelings toward Sajak, said Miller. ``I'm
grateful to Pat. It was a nice opportunity, a nice challenge,'' he
said.
   Miller, once an anchorman for KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, said he
didn't know where his career would take him next.

   The maker of a bicycle computer agreed to stop
using two-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond's name, photograph
or likeness in advertising without his approval.
   But the civil lawsuit filed against Avocet Inc. last month by
LeMond remains in effect under the stipulation signed by both
parties and approved Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Bruce Thompson.
   LeMond endorsed the Avocet cyclometer in 1989 for a $60,000 fee,
but that contract ended last year and he didn't give his permission
to continue using his image, according to his lawsuit.
   LeMond since has endorsed another bicycle computer.
   Michael Phillips, national sales manager for Avocet, based in
Menlo Park, Calif., has said he doesn't know why the racer filed
the lawsuit against his company because the ads in dispute depict
several riders.
   Nathan Jenkins, who represents LeMond, said that although the
picture shows LeMond with a group of other racers during the Tour
de France, ``you can be assured that the American public will only
recognize Greg LeMond.''
   The Avocet cyclometer functions as an odometer, speedometer,
stopwatch and clock, measuring things such as how fast and far a
bicycle has traveled per trip or during an extended time period.

   Former football star George Rogers was
suspended from his 2-month-old job as a fund-raiser for the
University of South Carolina after being arrested on cocaine
charges.
   Rogers, 31, who graduated from the university in 1980, has
worked since Feb. 3 as a fund-raiser for its College of Applied
Professional Sciences, spokeswoman Debrah Allen said Tuesday.
   He was arrested Saturday for possession with intent to
distribute cocaine and simple marijuana possession, along with
Marcus Gilliam, 28, another former South Carolina football player,
and Melvin Metz, 31. They three were released on $5,000 bonds. If
convicted, each faces a maximum of five years in prison.
   Ed Holler, Rogers' attorney, refused to comment on the case.
   Rogers, the NFL Rookie of the Year in 1981, spent seven years in
professional football. He was the first-round pick by the Saints in
1981 and played four seasons with New Orleans before being traded
to Washington.
   A street is named after Rogers in Columbia, and his picture is
painted in a mural on the wall of a building near the Statehouse.

<TEXT>
   Barbara Piasecka-Johnson, who left Poland
to seek her fortune and returned a U.S. multimillionaire, has
opened an exhibit of extraordinary art from her private collection
at Warsaw's Royal Palace.
   The Opus Sacrum exhibit of paintings, sculpture and other
objects with religious themes is being held in support of the
reforms that culminated in the installation of the East bloc's
first non-Communist government last fall.
   Mrs. Johnson ``wanted to honor these changes in a special way _
by organizing a great cultural event of international
significance,'' an introduction to the exhibit says.
   The Old Masters displayed include Renaissance and Baroque works
by such painters as Titian, Caravaggio and Raphael.
   ``They are all my favorites,'' Mrs. Johnson said before guiding
journalists through the exhibit.
   Proceeds from the sale of the catalogue and other publications
from the exhibit will be donated to Polish cultural conservation
efforts, especially in the historic southern city of Krakow, Mrs.
Johnson said. Other Polish exhibits from her collection are planned.
   Mrs. Johnson inherited much of the Johnson &amp; Johnson
pharmaceutical fortune after the death of her husband, Seward
Johnson, on whose household staff she had worked. She went through
an ugly court battle with other Johnson heirs over her husband's
will.
   Mrs. Johnson lives in Princeton, N.J., at her estate, Jasna
Polana.
   She was hailed as a heroine at the Gdansk shipyard where
Solidarity was founded after she offered last June to spend up to
$100 million for an interest in the yard, which was threatened with
liquidation by the then-Communist government.
   But the shipyard deal failed to materialize, apparently in part
because workers would not agree to the terms she offered.
   Mrs. Johnson bristled when it was suggested Tuesday that she
returned to Poland as an ``industrialist.''
   ``That is the wrong idea that I come here as an industrialist.
Saving monuments of Polish art and history is my purpose,'' she
said.

   Anatomy more than ability turned Larry Stidham, a
blue-collar fan of hockey and Bruce Springsteen, into an
impersonator of Luciano Pavarotti.
   Until a few years ago the 43-year-old plumber knew little about
opera.
   ``Who is he?'' Stidham wondered, when his friends mentioned his
resemblance to the rotund tenor.
   But friends insisted he capitalize on the look. His 215 pounds
were no match for the comfortably cushioned Pavarotti, so Stidham
began expanding, to his present 270. And he has the trademark
Pavarotti sparkle in his eyes.
   With the stage name ``Bearvarotti,'' Stidham dons a tuxedo and
white tie to plays weddings, balls and parties. Some describe his
voice as ``a howling wolf,'' but he gets rave reviews.
   ``I even had people break into tears,'' Stidham said Tuesday.
   There are some differences in his and Pavarotti's careers.
   Pavarotti made his opera debut in 1961 in ``La Boheme.''
   Stidham opened in 1984 in a suburban Algonquin bowling alley.
   Also unlike Pavarotti, who has been banned from the Chicago
Lyric Opera because of numerous no-shows, ``I don't cancel,''
Stidham said.
   In his debut, a lip-sync contest, Stidham mouthed the words to
``If We Were in Love'' from Pavarotti's movie, ``Yes, Giorgio.''
   He placed third, but he was hooked.
   He bought opera recordings and studied the Italian lyrics
syllable by syllable. He watched Pavarotti on TV, trying to pick up
his style.
   Soon, Stidham was doing events with other Chicago area star
look-alikes _ a false Sammy Davis Jr., a mock Willie Nelson, a
bogus Joan Collins.
   Stidham even dated a Crystal Gayle look-alike.
   ``My agent is a guy that looks like Henry Fonda,'' Stidham
noted, ``and I got another agent that's a Charlie Chaplin double.''
   Bearvarotti met Pavarotti once back-stage after a 1986
appearance by the opera singer at Chicago's Civic Opera House.
   The two men swapped autographs.

<HEAD>Men Close the Population Gap With Women</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even as women make gains in jobs and pay,
their lead is slipping in two areas where they traditionally are
ahead of men: how many there are and how long they live.
   Women still outlive and outnumber men in America, but improving
life expectancy rates for males allowed their total number to
increase faster than women during the 1980s for the first time
since early in this century, the Census Bureau said Tuesday.
   ``Male life expectancy has continued to improve gradually during
the decade. Female life expectancy has improved very little since
1982,'' said Frederick W. Hollmann of the Census Bureau.
   Life expectancy for men increased from 70.9 years in 1982 to
71.5 years in 1987, an improvement of six-tenths of a year, he
noted. During the same time, life expectancy for women went up only
one-tenth of a year, from 78.2 to 78.3.
   The reason is that men's death rates for such major killers as
cancer and heart disease dropped during the decade, while the
cancer rate for women increased and deaths from heart disease only
edged down.
   ``The male population outgrew the female population in every age
group under age 85,'' Hollmann reported.
   From 1980 to 1989 the number of men in the nation increased by
10,557,000, while the female population grew by 10,448,000, the
bureau reported.
   Even so, women continue to outnumber men in America, 127 million
to 121 million, the report showed.
   The last decade in which the number of men increased faster than
women was 1900-1910, the Census Bureau noted.
   The balance of population is determined not only by the number
of people born but by the number of years they remain alive,
explained Hollmann.
   More male babies are born than females, he pointed out, but
``generally a sort of equilibrium is reached since males don't live
as long as females.''
   The higher death rate for men means that although they outnumber
women at birth, women surpass men in total numbers later on.
   One consequence of males increasing faster than females in the
1980s was that in 1989 there were more men than women at each age
group below 34. In 1980 men had been more numerous only through age
26, Hollmann reported.
   Hollmann said a major contributor to the males outpacing females
in the 1980s was the changing patterns of disease as more and more
women took up smoking and moved into traditionally male-dominated
jobs and lifestyles.
   ``You could suggest that a lot of women took up smoking back in
the 1960s, so the difference between men and women in smoking
behavior tended to converge somewhat,'' said Hollmann. ``If
behavior (between the sexes) is converging, then you have to expect
mortality rates to converge also.
   ``There is a time lag between the time someone takes up smoking
and the time they come to highest risk of death,'' he said,
accounting for the change in comparative death rates in the 1980s.
   Between 1982 and 1986, for example, the cancer death rate for
males declined from 164.8 deaths per 100,000 men to 163.6. For
women the rate increased from 109.5 to 111.4.
   For heart disease, the death rate for men declined from 264.4
per 100,000 to 238.2. Women had a smaller decline, from 132.5 to
124.6.
   And deaths from cerebrovascular disease fell from 39.2 to 33.5
per 100,000 men from 1982 to 1986, while for women the drop was
from 33.2 to 29.0, also a smaller decline than for men.
   The census study used mortality data from the National Center
for Health Statistics, a division of the Department of Health and
Human Services.
   While the study did not include a breakdown by sex for
immigration, Hollmann said that also was a contributing factor to
the increase in males, since refugees coming into the country
tended to include somewhat more males than females during the 1980s.

<HEAD>Demand Puts Pressure on Corn, Soybeans Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. supply of corn and soybeans has
tightened because demand has been larger than expected, according
to a new analysis by the Agriculture Department.
   The new supply-and-demand outlook reflected recent figures
showing that March 1 corn and soybean inventories were smaller than
expected. Thus, Sept. 1 corn inventories are expected to be about
1.33 billion bushels, down from 1.48 billion forecast a month ago.
   Reduced U.S. stockpiles are also having an effect on global use
and supplies of the major grain, the report said.
   Last Sept. 1, the U.S. corn stockpile was 1.93 billion bushels,
reduced sharply by low yields caused by the 1988 drought. On Sept.
1, 1988, the corn inventory was 4.26 billion bushels.
   Corn prices nationally are expected to average $2.30 to $2.40
per bushel this marketing year, up five cents from the March
forecast but still well below the $2.54 average of the 1988-89
marketing year.
   In 1987-88, before the effects of the drought, corn prices
averaged $1.94 per bushel, the report said.
   On the international level, the report said global trade in corn
and other ``coarse'' grains is expected to be down slightly from
the March forecast, while world production is ``largely unchanged.''
   Global stockpiles of coarse grain _ which include corn, sorghum,
barley, oats, rye, millet and mixed grains _ are expected to be
down from last month's forecast to their lowest level since 1983-84
because of the reduced U.S. inventory.
   Soybean inventories going into the new marketing year on Sept. 1
were put at 305 million bushels, down from the March forecast of
330 million. However, that would be up from 182 million bushels of
soybeans on hand last Sept. 1.
   The Sept. 1, 1988 soybean stockpile was 302 million bushels.
Marketing year prices averaged $5.88 per bushel in 1987-88 before
soaring to $7.42 in 1988-89.
   With larger production and smaller demand, soybean prices are
expected to average in the range of $5.55 to $5.65 this marketing
year, unchanged from the March forecast.
   Global production of oilseeds, which includes soybeans, was
forecast at a record 213.2 million metric tons, down slightly from
last month but 5 percent more than last year.
   The report showed little change in the wheat supply and demand
for the 1989-90 marketing year that began last June 1.
   Wheat stockpiles are expected to be about 442 million bushels
this June 1, virtually the same as forecast last month. That would
compare with 702 million bushels on hand last June 1 and 1.26
billion bushels on June 1, 1988.
   Nationally, wheat prices were forecast at $3.70 to $3.75 per
bushel this marketing year, down a nickel at the upper end of the
range, compared with $3.72 in 1988-89 and $2.57 in 1987-88.

   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union has bought an additional 125,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices for delivery through mid-May.
   The sale, according to USDA records, was the first since Jan.
19, when the Soviet Union's authority for buying U.S. subsidized
wheat was virtually exhausted.
   A new allocation of 1 million tons was announced Feb. 23; about
12,950 tons were left over from a previous allocation.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Tuesday the wheat was sold by
three private companies, which will receive subsidies under the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Dickerson said 887,950 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation. Only wheat has been approved for
sale to the Soviets under the price subsidy program.
   The seventh year of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement began Oct.
1. With the latest sales, the Soviet Union has bought more than 2.9
million tons of wheat for 1989-90 delivery and more than 12.7
million tons of corn, plus soybeans and soybean meal. All of the
wheat was sold under EEP arrangements.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 125,000 tons are equal to almost 4.6 million bushels
worth about $19 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $31.53 per
ton, or about 86 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest wheat was sold by J. Aron &amp; Co.,
50,000 tons; Union Equity Cooperative Exchange, 50,000 tons; and
Mitsubishi International, 25,000 tons.

   Orange harvest prospects are virtually
unchanged from last month, according to new estimates by the
Agriculture Department.
   Production as of April 1 was forecast Tuesday at 172 million
boxes, down 18 percent from 209 million boxes last season,
primarily because of a freeze in December.
   Most of the reduction was attributed to a 30 percent decline in
the Florida crop, estimated at 103.1 million boxes against 146.6
million in 1988-89.
   The Texas crop was indicated at 1.2 million boxes, down from
1.85 million in 1988-89. California production, estimated at 66
million boxes, is up from 58.8 million last season, while the
Arizona harvest was indicated at 1.9 million boxes, up from 1.7
million last season.
   Total grapefruit production was forecast at 48.6 million boxes,
down 30 percent from last year, reflecting the freeze in Florida
and Texas.

<HEAD>Nuclear Plant Workers Exposed to Radiation, Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at the nation's nuclear power plants
are exposed to intolerably high levels of radiation, a consumer
group says.
   It said some agency other than the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
_ perhaps the Department of Health and Human Services _ should set
the level.
   Power plant employees are exposed to average radiation equal to
roughly 20 chest X-rays a year more than the what the general
public is exposed to, said Ken Bossong, executive director of an
energy research project of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy
group.
   Public Citizen released a study Tuesday showing more nuclear
power plant workers than ever before were exposed to measurable
radiation in 1988, albeit at a larger number of plants than ever
before.
   The study found 105,265 instances of worker exposure to
measurable radiation at the 107 commercial nuclear reactors in 1988.
   ``This is the highest number of incidents of worker exposure
ever recorded by the U.S. commercial nuclear power industry,'' the
organization said.
   It said its study, based on documents from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, found 104,511 such incidents in 1987 and
100,992 in 1986.
   The industry-sponsored Council of Energy Awareness, in a written
response to the report, said that ``the total number of exposed
individuals increased only because, according to Public Citizen's
figures, there were 10 more nuclear energy plants in operation than
the year before.'' Actually, Public Citizen said there were nine
more plants.
   In any case, the industry group pointed out that Public
Citizen's own numbers show that ``in 1988, the year on which they
report, the number of workers per plant who were exposed to any
measurable radiation decline to an all-time low, down 22 percent in
the five-year period, 1984-1988.''
   Public Citizen ``has proven once again that they don't let the
facts stand in the way of their determined anti-nuclear diatribe,''
the statement said.
   There were 98 plants operating in 1987, nine fewer than in 1988.
   Public Citizen's report acknowledged a decrease in the average
collective radiation dose of each reactor's work force. It also
said the average number of workers exposed per plant and the
average dose of exposure had gone down by 7 percent between 1987
and 1988.
   Experts on both sides agree that the greatest exposure to
workers comes during reactor maintenance work, mostly on older
reactors.
   ``Clearly when you have older plants you do have maintenance
more often,'' said Joseph Fouchard, a spokesman for the NRC.
   But he added, ``With respect to worker exposure to radiation at
nuclear power plants we believe it has been steadily improving. We
believe the situation is getting better.''
   Public Citizen said the United States eventually should stop
using nuclear power, but suggested that as long as the plants
continue to operate the NRC should lower the limits of worker
radiation exposure.
   The current NRC radiation exposure limit is 5.00 rems per year
per worker, with 2.4 times that much permitted for workers whose
jobs keep them close to the reactor. The accepted limit for the
general population is 500 millirems or one-tenth the amount for
nuclear plant workers, the group said.
   Public Citizen suggested having the exposure standards set by
another government agency, possibly the Department of Health and
Human Services.
   The group also criticized the lack of a centralized government
repository for information on the health status of nuclear power
plant workers.

   Here is the list of the 20 nuclear reactors
which the consumer group Public Citizen says were worst at exposing
workers to radiation in 1988.
   The group said it considered the number of exposed workers, the
collective radiation dose to the work force and other factors. Each
reactor is listed with its total number of worker exposures to
radiation for 1988, followed by the average exposure per worker,
expressed in rem.
   Federal regulations permit a plant worker to be exposed to 5.0
rem per year _ about five times the highest level reported. Public
Citizen said the average exposure in 1988 was 0.390 rem, about the
equivalent of 20 chest X-rays.
   Regulations permit employees who work in closer contact with the
reactor 2.4 times more exposure per year _ a total of 12 rems of
which no more than 3 rems may be absorbed in any one quarter.
However, Public Citizen chose only to use the figure for workers
not in close proximity to the reactors.
   Measured by exposure per worker, the La Salle, Maine Yankee and
Brunswick plants were the worst in the country.

<HEAD>Environmental Study Ranks South Last</HEAD>

   New England is leading the way in
environmental health, while the South has become the nation's
biggest waste dump, according to an environmental scorecard of the
50 states.
   The ``green index,'' a report released this week by the
Durham-based Institute for Southern Studies, examined 35 indicators
of pollution, public health, workplace safety and environmental
safety.
   The top five states were Vermont, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Rhode Island and Connecticut. Alabama was at the bottom, with six
of its Southern neighbors.
   George Hamilton, state planning director in Vermont, said the
ranking ``reflects the environmental policies that have been passed
over the last number of years. There is a strong environmental
ethic in the state. It's a bipartisan ethic that has been around
for 20 years.''
   But Ned Farquhar, acting director of the Vermont Natural
Resources Council, said he was surprised that Vermont ranked No. 1.
   ``Our laws aren't that strong and our budget is pitifully low
for environmental protection,'' Farquhar said. ``But the people in
our towns all care a lot about the environment so I really think it
all comes back to individual action.''
   The study ranked the 50 states on a per capita basis and other
factors that would minimize differences in population size. The
report was based on studies conducted in the mid- to late 1980s,
most of them conducted for the federal government, said Bob Hall,
research director for the non-profit, independent institute and the
study's author.
   The study focused on the South and concluded that the region has
become the nation's biggest waste dump, handling two-thirds of the
nation's hazardous waste.
   The bottom five states were Tennessee, South Carolina,
Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
   Hall said Alabama brought up the rear because of ``a combination
of having some significant problems and not having policies, being
slow in implementing good policies.''
   Environmental officials in Alabama do not have enough
information to judge the report, said Catherine Lamar, a
spokeswoman with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
   But Pat Byington, executive director of the Alabama Conservancy,
a statewide environmental organization, said he was not surprised
by the state's last-place finish.
   ``The state of Alabama has a lot of programs they need to
institute, environmental programs,'' he said. ``We do not have a
worker right-to-know law, we do not have a land acquisition program
or a toxics reduction program _ a pollution prevention program. And
we currently do not have a comprehensive solid-waste program, so
we're far behind.''
   The Northeast and Great Lake states fared poorly on the
institute's poison index, which includes standard measures such as
pollutants, air quality and per capita number of Superfund sites.
   But Hall said many of these states have taken aggressive action
to solve their problems. Their high scores for policies, public
health and workplace safety initiative boost their overall rankings.
   Most Mountain States ``score poorly in all areas related to
government initiative, holding fast to the frontier belief that the
less regulation, the better,'' said the report.

   Here is the listing of the nation's 107
commercial nuclear reactors and their worker radiation exposures as
given by Public Citizen on Tuesday.
   The list is alphabetical by name of plant. The first number
after the location is the number of worker exposures in 1988. The
second number is the average exposure per worker, expressed in rem.
   Federal regulations permit a power plant worker to be exposed to
5.0 rem per year. Public Citizen said the average exposure was
0.390 rem, which it said was about the equivalent of 20 chest
X-rays.
   Regulations permit employees who work in closer contact with the
reactor, generally reactor operators and technicians, 2.4 times
more exposure per year _ 12 rems, with no more than 3 rems aborbed
in one quarter. However, Public Citizen chose only to use the
figure for non-reactor workers.
   Measured by exposure per worker, the La Salle, Maine Yankee and
Brunswick plants were the worst in the country and the Fort St.
Vrain, South Texas-1 and Limerick-1 plants were the best.

<HEAD>Rural Residents Shy Away From Getting Emotional Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED STYCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WILLMAR, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Facing the prospect of losing their
104-year-old dairy farm, Albert and Carol Kobbermann became so
battered emotionally that they considered seeking counseling.
   But they didn't take the 30-mile trip from their farmstead to
the clinic in Willmar because they feared their neighbors' prying
eyes.
   ``When you're hit point-blank with a problem, it's what other
people think that you worry about, not what's best for yourself,''
Carol Kobbermann said as she recalled her family's feelings during
the farm crisis five years ago.``It's difficult to admit that
things are out of control. You feel like a failure.''
   The stigma of seeking help is one of several difficulties in
rural mental health care that are to be the subjectd at a public
hearing Thursday in Marshall, in southwest Minnesota. It's the
first of four hearings planned this year by the National Advisory
Mental Health Council and the National Mental Health Leadership
Forum.
   ``The biggest problem that we face in rural areas is, first, a
culture that says there aren't emotional problems in our part of
the country, and, second of all, if there are, we don't admit it,''
said Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., who will speak at the hearing.
   ``The extreme financial stress brought a lot of those problems
out into the open. Then we had to say, `Hey, we really have
problems with teen-age suicide, spousal abuse, depression and other
mental and emotional disorders,''' he said. P. Vincent Mehmel,
executive director of the West Central Community Services Center in
Willmar, said the center is busiest during the hard financial times.
   ``Farmers who have lost their crop or who have suffered a
significant loss, depression is there,'' Mehmel said. ``We're also
subject to the problem of unstable families. We once thought
(divorce and child and spouse abuse) was an urban problem. Now it's
a rural problem, too.''
   Statistics show the effect of hard times on mental health in the
six-county area, with 120,000 residents, that Mehmel's center
serves.
   Medical Assistance reimbursements for mental health care made to
Meeker County residents in 1986 _ at the peak of the farm crisis _
had increased 90.7 percent over the figure reported two years
earlier. The figures increased 66.9 percent in Swift County and
45.4 percent in Chippewa County.
   Mehmel also deals with the difficulties of recruiting
psychologists to rural settings, where the money, prestige and
cultural amenities don't match those of metropolitan areas.
   ``It's hard to get them, and when you do get them, they move on
in a few years,'' he said. ``To get a stable staff is a very
difficult thing.''
   About 5,500 patients visit the center's 30 mental health
professionals annually. No one knows how many are afraid to seek
help.
   ``The major problem is the mindset that it's not OK to get help
for mental problems,'' said Marlyn Benson, the center's rural
outreach coordinator. ``You're supposed to be tough and strong,
pull yourself up by your bootstraps, don't cry and ask for help.
   ``It's easier in a metro area to get help and not have your
neighbors know. People really know your business out here,'' said
Benson, who tells of people so embarrassed about visiting the
center that they park at a shopping mall and walk a quarter-mile to
their appointment.
   The Kobbermanns learned to cope with their stress and depression
when meetings they organized to discuss the farm crisis turned into
impromptu, neighbor-to-neighbor counseling sessions. Later, mental
health professionals were invited to speak to the group.
   The Kobbermanns feel more secure financially then they did a few
years ago. But if the bad old days return, Kobbermann believes
she'll cope better than she did a few years ago.
   ``I'm beyond the point of `What the neighbors think,''' she said.

<HEAD>Case Pits Medical Progress Against A Man's Right to His Cells</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A landmark biotechnology case is in the hands
of California's Supreme Court, which will decide whether a leukemia
patient can sue for a share of the profits from an anti-cancer drug
derived from his cells.
   The high court heard arguments Tuesday in the case of John
Moore, who claims blood cells from his cancerous spleen were
wrongfully used by the University of California, two UCLA
researchers and two drug and biotechnology companies that helped
develop the drug.
   University attorney Allen Wagner and lawyers for other
defendants argued that the development of lifesaving drugs will be
seriously impeded if the justices rule that Moore has property
rights to tissue and cells removed from his body.
   They said that would require researchers to negotiate and pay
for human tissue used for research and drug development.
   A decision in Moore's favor would have ``a devastating impact on
medical research,'' said Peter Abrahams, lawyer for defendant
Shirley Quan, a research assistant at UCLA.
   Moore, the 45-year-old president of a Seattle soft drink
company, said he is merely trying to defend ``the rights of the
individual patient in the case where the physician-researcher is
also a businessman-entrepreneur.''
   ``Without my knowledge or consent, the doctors and the research
institutions used a part of me for their own gain,'' Moore said
outside court. ``They stole something from me.''
   The high court's ruling is expected within 90 days. A ruling in
Moore's favor would allow his 1984 lawsuit to go to trial. The case
was dismissed by a Los Angeles Superior Court in 1986, then
reinstated in 1988 by a 2-1 vote of a state appeals court.
   During Tuesday's 70-minute hearing, the seven justices asked
questions that suggested sympathy with Moore's claim, but indicated
a reluctance to extend personal property rights to cells taken from
an organ after it is surgically removed.
   Moore was an Alaska pipeline surveyor in 1976 when he sought
treatment for hairy cell leukemia at UCLA. Dr. David Golde removed
Moore's spleen, the standard treatment for the rare leukemia, and
his disease went into remission.
   After the spleen was removed, Golde discovered it contained
unique blood cells that produced a blood protein called GM-CSF, now
in experimental use as a drug to stimulate the immune system to
fight certain cancers and possibly AIDS.
   Moore's attorney, Sanford Gage, said Moore never was told his
cells had great potential value. Yet for nearly seven years, Golde
and others brought Moore from Seattle to Los Angeles for blood and
other tests while they developed Moore's cells into a
self-perpetuating cell line to mass-produce GM-CSF.
   In 1984, UCLA received a patent for the cell line, naming Golde
and Quan as the inventors.
   The same year, Moore sued University of California regents,
Golde, Quan, Genetics Institute Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., and
Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. of East Hanover, N.J.
   The lawsuit claimed the defendants wrongfully ``converted'' to
their own use Moore's personal property, namely, blood cells from
his spleen. He also alleged they failed to obtain his informed
consent and breached their fiduciary responsibility to him.
   Golde's attorney, Anthony Murray, argued that Moore's diseased
spleen was worthless, and Golde and other defendants gave
commercial value to the blood cells through their own efforts.
   ``It's not as if you tap a tree and take maple syrup out of it,
put the maple syrup in a bottle and sell it,'' Murray said.
``Diseased tissue has no commercial value.''
   Gage replied that Moore's cells were vital to creating the cell
line and the drug.
   Moore is seeking only that share of drug proceeds that can be
separated from the efforts of the researchers and manufacturers of
the drug. Gage has argued that the market for lymphokines, a family
of drugs that includes GM-CSF, has been estimated at as much as $3
billion.
   He said deals that led to GM-CSF's development and production
resulted in Golde and others getting Genetics Institute stock now
worth $3 million. UCLA and Golde also received research grants
worth $440,000 from Genetics Institute and Sandoz, Gage added.
   ``The doctors were interested in commercial exploitation, yet
they did not reveal that to him,'' Justice Stanley Mosk said.
``Wasn't there an element of deception?''
   But Justice David Eagleson said that if Moore's claim is upheld,
any patient treated with drugs derived from his cells might be
accused of illegally converting Moore's property.

   Edmundo Mireles Jr., an FBI agent who was
wounded in a Miami shootout and later joined a class-action lawsuit
accusing the bureau of discrimination against Hispanics, is winner
of the agency's first Medal of Valor.
   Mireles and fellow agents were involved in a shootout outside
Miami on April 11, 1986, when they tried to follow a car carrying
two men they suspected were involved in a series of violent bank
robberies.
   ``Special agent Mireles found himself face to face with his
moment of truth,'' FBI Director William Sessions said at the award
ceremony Tuesday. ``His fellow agents were down. He himself was
severely wounded.
   ``Yet in the face of appalling gunfire, he found the courage and
the stamina to return fire and fatally wounded both Michael Lee
Platt and William Russell Matix,'' Sessions said.
   The Medal of Valor is given for ``exceptional acts of heroism in
the face of life-threatening situations.''
   Mireles accepted the award in part in the memory of the two
agents slain that day _ Benjamin Grogan and Jerry Dove _ and gave
special recognition to two other agents who helped him survive.
   ``Gilbert Orantia and Ron Riesner ... saved my life on that
day.''
   Mireles, 36, took a year to recover from his wounds, which
shattered one arm.
   A federal judge in Texas, ruling last year on the 1988
class-action lawsuit filed by 311 Hispanic agents, found there was
pervasive discrimination against Hispanic FBI agents and ordered
the bureau to take steps to promote Hispanics.

<HEAD>Census Response Reaches 50 Percent</HEAD>

   The Census Bureau says at least half the
people asked to fill out census forms have done so.
   ``We expect the number to grow,'' spokeswoman Paulette
Lichtman-Panzer said Tuesday.
   She said the 50 percent response rate counted only forms that
have been ``logged in'' by census offices across the nation and
that many places have a backlog of returns waiting to be checked.
   The Bureau mailed out 88 million forms on March 23 and hand
delivered an additional 11 million to homes where proper mailing
addresses could not be obtained.
   In addition, census takers are working with postal officials to
correct problems in several communities where forms could not be
delivered for one reason or another, officials said.
   ``If anyone has put off answering the census, now's the time to
do so,'' said Lichtman-Panzer, stressing the need to increase the
mail response rate.
   Census officials have told Congress that they hope for a 70
percent response rate.
   Census offices will begin sending out workers April 26 to homes
where no form has been sent back, said Lichtman-Panzer.

<HEAD>Nunn Resigns From All-Male Club In Suburban Washington</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a move bound to fuel speculation about his
presidential ambitions, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., has resigned from a
private golf club that lost a legal fight over its refusal to admit
women members.
   ``I have dropped out for personal reasons,'' Nunn said in a
statement released by his office Tuesday in response to questions
about his membership in the Burning Tree Club, located in the
affluent Washington suburb of Bethesda, Md.
   Nunn, who considered running for the Democratic nomination for
president in 1988, did not elaborate on his reasons for quitting
the club, whose members include some of the nation's most powerful
political leaders.
   ``My priority is to run for re-election to the U.S. Senate,''
Nunn said in the statement. ``As I have said many times, I have no
plans or inclination to run for president. At no time have I ever
established a pre-set time frame for contemplating a decision on a
future presidential campaign.''
   Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was the
favorite of Southern and conservative Democrats during the early
part of the 1988 presidential campaign, but he twice refused to
jump into the race, citing family pressures and his Senate duties.
   The Burning Tree Club has been an all-male bastion since its
founding in 1922.

<TEXT>
   A study published in a medical journal today
links job stress with high blood pressure and with changes in the
heart that often precede coronary disease and heart attacks.
   The changes were noted in male workers in New York City ranging
from garbage collectors to stockbrokers.
   The findings, based on an ongoing study of 215 men from 30 to
60, are reported in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   Job strain resulted when workers felt they faced high
psychological demands without having much control over day-to-day
decisions, said Dr. Peter Schnall, lead researcher at Cornell
University Medical College in New York.
   Twenty-one percent of the subjects suffered job strain. They
faced up to three times greater risk of having high blood pressure
than those who did not experience job strain, said Carl Pieper, a
Cornell statistician.
   All men ages 30 to 40 years old with high-stress jobs had a
``clinically significant'' thickening of the heart's left
ventricle, or chamber, a condition that often precedes coronary
disease and heart attacks, Pieper said in a telephone interview
Tuesday.
   Their heart muscles were an average of 20 grams bigger than
those without job stress, a ``substantial'' difference but still
within normal range, Schnall said by telephone Tuesday.
   ``To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a
psychosocial variable based on job characteristics has been found
to be related to both hypertension and anatomic increases in heart
mass,'' the researchers wrote.
   ``If our model is correct, job situations where the level of
work demands exceeds the individual's ability to control or deal
with those demands creates a challenge that activates the
sympathetic nervous system and leads to an elevation of blood
pressure at work.
   ``Long-term exposure (over years) to job strain is hypothesized
to ultimately result in a sustained elevation of blood pressure
that then causes structural change in the cardiovascular system,''
they wrote.
   While the notion that psychological factors can physically
affect the body is not new, it is viewed with skepticism by some
medical authorities, Dr. Redford B. Williams of Duke University
Medical Center said in an accompanying editorial.
   ``If these results are considered along with the growing
contributions of neuroscience to our understanding of how the brain
speaks to the body's organs, perhaps the idea that the brain plays
a role in physical disease will soon seem less `revolutionary' and
more like `normal science,''' Williams said.
   The men studied had all worked in the same job for at least
three years, none was more than 20 percent overweight and none had
suffered heart disease before the study began in 1986.
   Eighty-one percent were white, the remaining were mostly black,
and 87 had high blood pressure at the start of the study.
   The authors concluded that job strain was ``significantly
related'' to high blood pressure and increased heart mass after
adjusting for factors such as age, alcohol intake and smoking.
   ``We're not showing that job strain is causing heart disease,''
Schnall said. ``What we're showing is that job strain is causing a
change in muscle mass'' that could lead to disease.
   The study, based on data gathered through 1989, is continuing
for another five years to determine if the changes are permanent or
progressive, he said.

Study Finds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The mind's power over the body enables many
people to keep death at bay while waiting for occasions that are
important to them, say researchers who documented the phenomenon
among thousands of subjects.
   The researchers found marked drops in death rates among Jewish
men before Passover and among elderly Chinese women before the
Harvest Moon Festival, said a report in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   ``The results suggest quite strongly that some people are able
to postpone death briefly in order to reach an occasion which is
psychologically significant to them,'' said lead researcher David
P. Phillips, a sociology professor.
   ``In the case of the Chinese, there was a drop of 35 percent in
the mortality before the holiday,'' he said in an interview Tuesday
from the University of California at San Diego in La Jolla. ``There
was a peak in deaths of 35 percent the week after, over what would
normally be expected.''
   In the case of the Jews, the drop was about 24 percent before
Passover, Phillips said, and a corresponding peak in the week after
the holiday.
   In both studies the effect was strongest for cerebrovascular
diseases, such as strokes, followed by heart disease and cancer,
the researchers said. Only natural causes of death were studied.
   Elderly Chinese women were chosen as subjects because they hold
the central ceremonial role in festival observances, the
researchers said. Jewish men hold the central role in Passover.
   Findings about the Jews were first published in 1988 in the
British journal Lancet, but the Chinese findings were new. Both
groups lived in California, where the research was conducted.
   ``The research is very sound,'' said Dr. Cecil G. Sheps,
distinguished professor of social medicine emeritus at the
University of North Carolina School of Medicine at Chapel Hill.
   ``I think he's done enough of it now to warrant people taking it
seriously and pursuing studies that would try to determine what the
mechanism is by which these postponements take place,'' he said in
a telephone interview Tuesday.
   Phillips and fellow researcher Daniel G. Smith wrote that the
phenomenon may be due to an unidentified interaction between
psychology and biology, or to careful adherence to medication
schedules or enhanced care by family or physicians.
   Birthdays and other significant events can help postpone death,
the researchers said.
   A famous example is the death of Thomas Jefferson, the author of
the Declaration of Independence, on July 4th, 1826, exactly 50
years after the document's signing.
   Phillips said Jefferson's death came only after he had asked his
physician, ``Is it the Fourth?'' and received the reassurance, ``It
soon will be.''
   Fellow signer John Adams, the nation's second president, died
the same day as Jefferson.
   Phillips said the study involving the scanning of computerized
death records of Chinese women 75 years old and over in California
during the 24-week period around the Harvest Moon Festival each
year for 25 years _ from 1960 through 1984.
   The dip in their death rates before the holiday and subsequent
peak in death rates immediately afterward was absent among
non-Chinese people. The study of about 1,900 Jewish men had similar
findings in the non-Jewish population around Passover.

   Pakistan's military intelligence is organizing
a conventional army from Afghan refugees to topple a popular leader
of Afghanistan's rebel forces, according to a published report.
   The Washington Times cited three U.S. officials, none of them
identified, as the source for its report that more than 2,000 young
Afghans from refugee camps in Pakistan are being prepared for an
offensive against Ahmad Shah Massoud, known as the Lion of Panjshir.
   The report said he is recognized as the only rebel leader with a
serious organization at both the civil and military level, but
refuses to follow orders from Pakistan's intelligence agency, which
coordinates foreign aid to the mujahedeen resistance and directs
its operations.

<HEAD>China to Send 3,000 Students to Study Overseas This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China will send 3,000 students abroad this year,
the same number as in previous years, but most will be older
students on short-term programs, an official report said today.
   China has stressed that it will continue to send students
overseas but in the past six months has placed new restrictions on
studying abroad.
   The new regulations were prompted by fears that students would
not return, especially after last year's brutal crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement.
   Authorities are clearly concerned about students being exposed
abroad to ideas and lifestyles that might make them rebellious or
inclined not to return.
   Official reports have said that 3,000 students sponsored by the
central government study overseas each year, although one report
said China sent 5,000 students to study abroad last year.
   Shi Weiren, an official of the State Education Commission, said
half of those to be sent this year will be older research students
and senior scholars applying for six-month to one-year visiting
scholar programs, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   Four hundred students will enroll in doctoral programs overseas,
Shi said. In addition, 700 students will go abroad on World Bank
Loans, Xinhua said without providing other details.
   Education Vice Minister He Dongchang said in September that
China would increase the number of visiting scholars it sends
overseas while reducing the number in graduate and doctoral
programs.
   He said visiting scholars are able to ``attain quicker academic
results'' than those enrolled in degree programs because their
overseas stays are shorter. Visiting scholars also tend to be older
academics who are more likely to return and are considered more
politically mature.
   Shi said, ``Facts have shown that sending student abroad is a
very effective way to introduce into China advanced foreign
knowledge, science and technology and managerial experience, and to
train highly qualified professionals.''
   In the past 12 years, China has sent between 60,000 and 80,000
students for education in foreign countries. However, nearly half
have failed to return.
   In addition, more than 20,000 Chinese students have gone
overseas on their own, and many have stayed abroad.
   The new restrictions that have gone into effect recently include
requiring self-financed students to work five years before going
overseas.

<HEAD>Disney Says Moviegoers Detest On-Screen Advertising</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only kind of commercials most
moviegoers want to see in theaters are commercials for other
movies, according to a poll commissioned by Walt Disney Co.
   The poll showed that 90 percent of film patrons surveyed
recently in 10 metropolitan areas oppose showing non-movie
commercials, Disney said Tuesday to back up its ban on showing them
in movie houses with Disney films.
   ``A commercial is a commercial and one of the reasons we go to
the movies is to get away from them,'' Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman
of the Disney Studios, said at a news conference. ``They've been
booing (commercials) and the reaction has been getting worse and
worse.''
   But the poll found that filmgoers embraced watching coming
attractions; 95 percent are in favor of commercials for upcoming
movies.
   The survey, conducted by the National Research Group, canvassed
18,772 moviegoers March 31 in New York, Boston, Indianapolis,
Chicago, Austin, Oklahoma City, Nashville, Seattle, San Francisco
and in Orange County, Calif.
   Disney announced in February that it would prohibit on-screen
advertising in any theater showing films made by Disney or its
affiliated studios, Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures.
   The ban excludes slides shown during intermission and public
service announcements approved by Disney.
   The company's decision was met with criticism from some theater
owners who count on advertising to boost revenues. A number of
advertisers and advertising buyers were displeased, too.
   ``When we first announced our policy, we naively thought that we
were dealing with an issue in which the facts were self-evident,''
Katzenberg said. ``But even though we received hundreds of letters
and phone calls supporting our claim, there were still skeptics who
said we had no empirical data.''
   Katzenberg also defended the widespread practice of companies
paying moviemakers to use their products in films. He said his
studio and others had abused the practice, but he averred that
movies set in the real world should use real merchandise.
   He added, however, that Disney no longer would accept payments
to place alcohol and tobacco in movie scenes.

   A tornado and hailstorm in southern China's
Guangdong tore up dozens of buildings and overturned a ferry,
killing 16 people, an official newspaper reports.
   The Yangcheng Evening News said the storm hit coastal Yangjiang
city and surrounding towns on Monday afternoon, raining huge
hailstones, the largest of which weighted 11 pounds and measured 24
inches across.
   A ferry crossing the Moyang River overturned and sank, killing
10 people and injuring five. Two were killed and five injured when
a small store at an elementary school collapsed, the report said.
   It did not say how the other four died. It said two people were
missing.
   More than 250 buildings collapsed and 11 ferries and fishing
boats were lost, the paper reported. The storm also caused serious
agricultural damage, it said without elaborating.

   A bar owner put on the dog for visiting
Vice President Dan Quayle, mixing sarcasm with his special of the
day.
   The Quart House's Tuesday special _ the 25-cent Quail Dog _
looks like a real hot dog but is nothing but a turkey on the
inside, according to the bar's advertisement.
   ``What have you seen Dan Quayle do in the last two years? What
are his qualifications for anything? All he's ever been is a
politician,'' said Bill Ward, the Quart House's owner. ``In my
opinion, he's just a hot dog.''
   Quayle visited the city of 18,000 about 80 miles west of Omaha
to speak about the Job Training Partnership Act and attend a
fund-raiser for Republican Gov. Kay Orr, who is seeking re-election.
   Ward's opinion did not appear to be shared by others in the
town, said Dave Beckwith, a spokesman for Quayle.
   ``The vice president was deeply impressed by the overwhelmingly
enthusiastic reception he got in Columbus and he's grateful for the
hospitality that he received,'' Beckwith said. ``We saw nothing but
a friendly welcome.''
   In Peoria, Ill., the Hit the Trail for Quayle Club recently
launched a letter-writing campaign to comedians to get the vice
president out of punch lines.
   Meanwhile, Quail Dogs proved to be popular at the Quart House.
About 60 were sold by Tuesday night.
   ``Nobody's giving me any heck about it. People are getting a
good laugh out of it and that's what it's really supposed to do,''
Ward said.

<HEAD>Canadians Report 141 Unidentified Flying Objects in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unexplained flashing lights and
strange circles in the ground are spotted in Quebec, a saucer zooms
over houses in Newfoundland and a diamond-shaped object zips
through the Manitoba sky.
   Throughout the country, people said they saw at least 141
unidentified flying objects last year, according to what's being
touted as Canada's first national survey of UFO sightings.
   ``It tells us that UFOs haven't gone away, it tells us that UFOs
are being seen right across Canada,'' said Chris Rutkowski, a
Winnipeg researcher who compiled the study.
   Rutkowski put together the survey from reports submitted to
private investigators, police and the Ottawa-based National
Research Council, which supplied two-thirds of the material for the
study.
   Such information was always available but never marshalled into
a form that painted a picture of UFO sightings across the country,
he said.
   More than half the reports didn't have enough information to
evaluate properly and one third had probable explanations, said
Rutkowski, who has a degree in astronomy and is president of the
Winnipeg branch of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
   Of the rest, seven sightings were stamped as solidly unknown,
meaning they were seen by several people and investigated by the
police and National Research Council, without any explanation being
found, he said.
   He related three such incidents.
   Startled residents of the rural Quebec community of
Ste-Marie-de-Monnoir saw flashing lights glide over a field and out
of sight. The next morning, they found strange circles swirled into
the ground.
   At Wesleyville, Newfoundland, eight or nine people noticed a
classic saucer-shaped object swoop low over rooftops and along the
shoreline.
   And near Beaver Creek, Manitoba, people reported seeing a
diamond shape with red lights zip over their car and out across
Lake Winnipeg.
   Rutkowski stresses that he wants to take a rational, scientific
approach to the reports and will not offer any theories about
unexplained sightings.
   But he hopes publicity from the survey will spark more people to
come forward with their observations, providing a larger body of
evidence that could be investigated by scientists.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Seeks Answers To Hispanic Dropout Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents are partly to blame for the high
dropout rate among Hispanic teen-agers, but economic pressures make
it hard for many to finish high school, witnesses told a hearing on
Hispanic education.
   ``The students have to support their families, and I don't think
that's right,'' said Liz Cuevas, a 16-year-old San Antonio student.
``They say, `I'm getting money now. I don't know if I'm going to be
alive tomorrow.'''
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos told a news conference after
he opened the hearing _ the first of five regional meetings on
Hispanic education _ that Hispanic parents have to get more
involved in education.
   ``We must have a commitment from Hispanics, from Hispanic
parents especially, that their childern will be educated,'' he
said. ``That is the first vital step.''
   The hearing, and others to follow in Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles
and Boston, were organized by a federal task force on what
President Bush has called the crisis in Hispanic education.
   During the 1980s, about 40 percent of Hispanics nationwide left
school before high school graduation, Cavazos said. The rate for
all groups in the United States is 30 percent.
   Only 11 percent of Hispanics complete four or more years of
college by the time they are in their early 30s, Cavazos said.
   Gloria Rodriguez, executive director of the Avance family
support project in San Antonio, testified that a study by her
organization found one reason students drop out is that their
parents don't expect them to finish high school.
   ``Parenting is not something that comes naturally. It is a skill
that you learn,'' said Ms. Rodriguez, whose program helps parents
learn about child care while furthering their education and job
training.
   Louis J. Agnese Jr., president of Incarnate Word College in San
Antonio, said lack of money, lack of preparation and perceptions of
failure cause Hispanics to leave school.
   Agnese proposed a national marketing campaign showing
achievement through Hispanic role models. He also said politicians
must find equitable funding for all school districts.
   Cavazos defended his remark to the Texas Legislature last month
that a large infusion of money is not necessarily the answer to the
state's school funding woes.
   ``I said that it is not appropriate for me to come here and tell
you how to find the money,'' Cavazos said. ``I also said I do not
doubt that there are some school districts in this state that need
additional funding.''

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Judd Gregg vetoed what he called the
nation's most liberal abortion rights law, less than two weeks
after his counterpart in Idaho rejected the most restrictive state
abortion bill.
   The bill Gregg vetoed would have allowed unrestricted abortions
until the fetus could live outside the womb and after that to
protect the life or health of the mother or if the fetus had a
life-threatening physical or congenital abnormality.
   ``This bill authorizes abortion for convenience, sex selection,
as a form of birth control and with or without parental
notification or consent in the case of a minor,'' Gregg said
Tuesday in his veto message to the Legislature.
   Government has an obligation to protect life, the Republican
governor said, and life begins at conception.
   ``I obviously will not support legislation which represents a
dramatic expansion of the availability of abortion as a means of
terminating life in New Hampshire,'' he said.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus on March 30 vetoed a bill that would
virtually have banned abortions for the purpose of birth control.
   Gregg took issue with supporters who claimed the New Hampshire
bill sustained the principle of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court
decision that legalized abortion.
   ``This bill allows abortion throughout the term of pregnancy,
including arguably as late as the ninth month, if the `health' of
the mother is an issue,'' said Gregg, who called that ``a term so
vague as to be worthless as a limiting function.''
   Opponents of the measure praised Gregg.
   ``We thank God for a victory here. It shows the governor is a
man of integrity and he kept his promise,'' said Russell Pond,
director of the New Hampshire Pro Life Council.
   Abortion rights advocates argued that the bill essentially
legalized current practice. They said 91 percent of all abortions
in the country are done in the first 12 weeks and that only .01
percent are done after 24 weeks.
   ``This is a sad day for freedom in New Hampshire,'' said Robert
Spurrier, the state's spokesman for Planned Parenthood of Northern
New England.
   He said Gregg turned his back on ``the solid pro-choice majority
of New Hampshire citizens.''
   Originally, the bill allowed unrestricted abortions through the
24th week, but the Senate changed that to a fetal viability
standard, determined by the woman's doctor.
   Gregg said that meant abortions could be performed as late as
the seventh month ``depending on the doctor's view.''
   House leaders haven't set a date to consider overriding the
veto. Two earlier votes on versions of the bill failed to generate
the two-thirds margin needed for override.

   State officials are starting a $28.6
million ad campaign, financed by a tax on cigarettes, that they
hope will convince three-quarters of California's smokers to kick
the habit by the year 2000.
   Beginning today, ads with some of the strongest language ever
used to attack smoking and tobacco companies will appear on
television, radio, in newspapers and on billboards throughout the
state, said Dr. Kenneth Kizer, head of the state Department of
Health Services.
   The money for the effort is coming from a 25-cent per pack tax
hike authorized under Proposition 99, a referendum passed last
year. That brought the total state tax to 35 cents a pack.
   The TV commercials are aimed especially at youths, pregnant
women and minorities. They sharply condemn the way tobacco
companies sell their products.
   One commercial shows a smoke-filled room, packed with cynical
executives devising a marketing campaign for cigarettes.
   One executive discusses the need to lure 3,000 new smokers every
day to replace smokers who die from tobacco-related illnesses or
who quit.
   ``We're not in business for our health,'' the executive sneers.
   ``This is going to be a media campaign about a media campaign _
as much about hype as hygiene,'' says one advertisement, running in
30 newspapers. It accuses the tobacco industry of ``predatory
marketing, the selective exploitation of the young, the selling of
suicide.''
   Kizer said the 15-month campaign will be bigger than any run
before.
   ``The average state spends about $100,000 a year on anti-tobacco
messages and education,'' he said.
   But the tobacco industry, Kizer said, spent about $3.2 billion
in 1988 for advertising and promotion.
   The state hopes the campaign, in tandem with teaching programs,
will lead to a 20 percent decrease in smoking by June 1991 and a 75
percent reduction by 2000.
   About one in four of California's 29 million residents smoke,
buying more than 2 billion packs of cigarettes a year.
Tobacco-related disease costs about $5.6 billion and kills about
30,000 people annually in California, Kizer said.
   Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute, an
industry group based in Washington, D.C., said the ads are an
attack on the tobacco industry rather than an attempt to educate
the public about smoking's health risks.
   ``It is a pretty far-flung idea that if you attack the tobacco
industry, you're going to get people to stop smoking. ... You're
propagandizing,'' she said.
   Kizer accused tobacco companies of targeting teen-agers in order
to hook customers when they're young, and of pushing its products
at recently arrived immigrants who don't know how dangerous smoking
is.
   Ms. Dawson said the industry believes adults should have the
right to smoke.
   ``The industry is very much opposed to young people smoking. We
don't want them for our customers,'' she said. ``Cigarettes are
products for adults like many other things are products for adults,
such as alcoholic beverages or cars.''
   Steve Kessler, Health Services Department assistant director,
said the state's ads are meant to counter the industry's seductive
marketing of smoking.
   ``Smoking is not sexy,'' Kessler said. ``Smoking is not
glamorous. It's not youthful. That's the message we're trying to
sell. Smoking is dirty. Smoking is dumb from a health perspective.''
   Radio commercials feature a series of comedians telling jokes
about topics like smokers' breath, smokers' hack, tobacco-stained
hands and the expense of smoking.
   ``A crazy thought,'' says one comedian. ``I mean why sell
cigarettes? Why not just sell phlegm and cut out the middle man?''
   ``I think some of (the ads) are going to be controversial, and
there will be some debate over them,'' Kessler said. ``But first
and foremost, we're trying to protect the health of Californians.''
   Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease,
killing more people than alcohol, illegal drugs, accidents,
homicides and suicides combined, said state Health and Welfare
Secretary Clifford Allenby.
   Smoking is associated with an increased risk of heart disease,
stroke, high blood pressure, emphysema and several kinds of cancer.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall In Tokyo, Dollar In Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's chief index erased its
early gains and fell back today as the dollar quickly rose against
the Japanese yen in the afternoon.
   The dollar ended at 158.50 yen, up 0.35 yen from Tuesday's close
of 158.15 yen. It opened lower, at 157.60 yen, and ranged between
157.50 and 158.50 yen.
   The currency rose as investment trust companies bought it for
technical position adjustments following the currency's lower
opening in Tokyo after its overnight downswing on overseas markets,
dealers said.
   Many players, including institutional investors, remained on the
sidelines, said Shinzo Yamamoto, a trader with Daiwa Bank.
   ``The dollar started rising as market players bought it when it
fell as low as 157.50 yen, but there was no dollar-selling drive to
push it back,'' he said.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost
184.40 points, or 0.62 percent, ending the day at 29,440.28 points.
The index regained 320.33 points, or 1.08 percent, at the end of
morning trading. On Tuesday it lost 773.25 points.
   Volume on the first section, where most blue chip stocks are
listed, was a thin 500 million shares, down from 550 million the
previous day.
   A Nomura Securities trader attributed the index's afternoon
losses to the yen's downturn and an increase in the commercial
paper (CP) rate.
   ``The market was largely discouraged by the upswing in the CP
rate, which rose above 7 percent,'' he said, adding that the
increase renewed fears of increased interest rates.
   CPs are unsecured promissory notes for corporations, issued to
provide short-term financing. They are sold at a discount and
redeemed at face value, and their rates are considered a key
indicator of short-term interest rate movement.
   Higher interest rates tend to discourage stock investment.
Japan's central bank raised its official discount rate last month
to 5.25 percent from the previous 4.25 percent, but Japan's central
bank and Finance Ministry have since ruled out any additional
discount rate hike.
   In earlier trading, the Nikkei rose following the yen's higher
opening against the dollar, traders said.
   ``The yen plunged yesterday because of doubts about Group of
Seven cooperation in supporting the yen, but its overnight gain
overseas wiped out such fears among Japanese participants,'' said
Katsuya Igarashi, a trader with New Japan Securities Co.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno, after returning from a
meeting of financial authorities of the G-7 nations in Paris last
weekend, said they had pledged to intervene in currency markets to
support the falling yen.
   The G-7 is composed of Japan, Canada, the United States,
Britain, France, Italy and West Germany.
   But market analysts say some G-7 nations regard the yen's
weakness as Japan's internal problem and are reluctant to help the
currency rise unless Japanese financial authorities take further
steps, such as raising domestic interest rates. Traders said
Japanese market players generally assume the same.
   Stock traders said the key to a stock market recovery is the
yen's stability.
   Discouraged by the yen's downswing, the price of the benchmark
No.119 Japanese government bonds closed at 86.30 points, down from
Tuesday's close at 86.54. Their yield rose to 7.295 percent from
the previous day's 7.245 percent.

   Despite her promise to buy pink
lifeboats to guard residents against floods, voters in this small
town in the wine-growing region rejected the mayoral aspirations of
transsexual Terri Pohrman.
   Pohrman, 37, who favored red sequin gowns with decolletage,

<HEAD>List Conviction, Sentence Depend on Reading of Mental State</HEAD>

   John E. List's attorney has conceded that
the former Sunday school teacher killed his family 18 years ago,
but how long List is likely to spend in prison depends on the
jury's reading of his mental state.
   List's attorney, Elijah L. Miller Jr., rested his case Tuesday,
and the jury was expected to receive it today.
   The bulk of Miller's defense depended on a psychiatrist and a
psychologist who testified that List suffered from an
obsessive-compulsive disorder that prevented him from acting
rationally.
   Because of this disorder, the pressures of impending bankruptcy
and his wife's terminal illness, Miller has argued, List could see
no alternative other than to murder his wife, mother and three
children on Nov. 9, 1971.
   On Monday, Superior Judge William L'E. Wertheimer ruled that the
jury could find List guilty of second-degree murder, carrying a
30-year maximum prison term; or first degree murder, which carries
a life term.
   For a first-degree conviction, the state must prove that List
acted willfully, premeditatively and deliberately, a point that a
psychiatrist testifying for the prosecution stressed Tuesday.
   ``At all times, John List was capable of deliberating upon the
deed,'' Dr. Steven S. Simring said.
   List definitely had an ``obsessive'' personality, but his
condition could not be defined as a personality disorder, said
Simring, who read from what he said were notes of List's chilling
account of the killings.
   ``It was a horrible thing but, when I started, it was like I was
on auto, autodrive. It was almost with a sigh of relief that I
killed all of them and there weren't one or two survivors,'' List
was quoted as saying.
   Simring said List told him he shot his wife, Helen, 46, at the
breakfast table while she had toast and coffee, then went to the
third floor and shot his mother, Alma, 85, at close range.
   He left to do errands, returned for lunch and killed each child
successively: Patricia, 16; John, 15; and Frederick, 13.
   Simring said List choked up and became teary at the point in the
interview when he talked of shooting John. As Simring went through
his notes, List hunched forward in his chair and his face turned
red.
   List, who had been living in Virginia under an assumed name, was
arrested in June after a caller responded to a televised show about
the murders.

   Floating booms corraled an oil slick on
the Milwaukee River after billowing smoke from a warehouse fire
forced authorities to halt expressway traffic, evacuate homes and
close businesses.
   About $2 million was lost in the nine-hour blaze Tuesday that
consumed the Harrison Oil Corp., a distributor of engine
lubrication oils and pesticides, said Norman Wichman, the fire
chief. The cause has yet to be determined.
   No one was seriously injured. One firefighter was overcome by
fumes and heat, and another gashed his face when he fell.
   Traffic on a three-mile section of Interstate 43 in the northern
Milwaukee suburb was detoured for several hours. Two schools and a
stereo equipment manufacturer were closed because of fears the
thick, dark smoke was toxic.
   Three square blocks of houses were evacuated, but most
homeowners were allowed to return by Tuesday evening.
   Officials said an unknown quantity of oil, anti-flame foam and
insecticides seeped into the river and might kill fish and
waterfowl there.
   The Coast Guard helped lay booms across the river, which feeds
Lake Michigan, to contain the slick, said Dean Kelley, emergency
response coordinator for the state Department of Natural Resources.
   Plant manager Gil Dombek said the building held 50,000 to
100,000 gallons of outboard engine oil and 2,000 to 3,000 gallons
of kerosene. Nearly all the contents were engulfed by noon, he said.
   About 150 gallons of a cattle insecticide were believed to have
burned and could have produced toxic fumes, Dombek said.
   No workers were in the building when fire started shortly after
4 a.m., Wichman said. The fire, which apparently started near some
boxes in a stock area, was extinguished with foam from an airport
fire truck.

<HEAD>Easter Visits Approved for Young Brothers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pair of young brothers, separated when their
adoptive parents returned one of them to an orphanage, will be
allowed a brief visit with each other for the first time since the
Christmas season.
   The parents, who rejected 11-year-old Rick because they said he
wouldn't ``bond'' with them, have refused for three months to allow
the boys to see each other.
   The issue became public when the parents were sued earlier this
month by Cook County Public Guardian Patrick T. Murphy.
   Rick _ not his real name _ was told of the meeting on Monday at
the foster home where he lives.
   ``He's very, very happy about it,'' Murphy said Tuesday. ``But
the next thing he said was, `When is the next visit?' At this point
we have to say, `We don't know.'''
   Rick's 9-year-old brother is still living with the suburban
Bellwood couple.
   Murphy said the parents' concession for a single visit is cruel
and likened it to a Chinese water torture.
   ``One visit doesn't mean anything,'' he said. Rick ``can't go
through the rest of his life wondering when he will be allowed to
see his brother again.''
   The boys have been permitted three visits and three telephone
conversations after the parents took Rick to the orphanage in
November, more than five years after the adoption. The last visit
was shortly after Christmas.
   The parents, identified in court papers as Pamela and Joseph
Doe, adopted the brothers in August 1984. The state took the boys
from their natural mother because she was accused of abusing them.
   The county is seeking a court order compelling the parents to
allow the boys to visit each other. It also seeks $50,000 for
alleged emotional distress to Rick.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Daniel J. Berrigan, his brother
Philip and six other protesters have been spared further jail time
for a 1980 protest in which they damaged nuclear missiles and
poured blood on documents.
   A judge on Tuesday ruled that the time the ``Plowshares Eight''
defendants had already served was sufficient punishment. But he
warned that further law-breaking could send them back behind bars.
   Common Pleas Judge James Buckingham, who was assigned to handle
the resentencing in the town outside Philadelphia, expressed
sympathy for the defendants, although he did not condone their
actions.
   ``The defendants were attempting to make a statement of their
deep-felt convictions,'' he said. ``I agree with many of those
convictions. We are all concerned about nuclear war.''
   The eight, including three priests and a nun, were convicted in
1981 of burglary, conspiracy and criminal mischief. They were
originally sentenced to terms ranging from 1{ to 10 years and had
served sentences ranging from five days to 9{ months.
   ``I think it was a fair decision and for once we ran into a
decent judge,'' said Philip Berrigan, 66, of Baltimore. ``What he
did was totally unexpected.''
   ``I was all set to go to jail,'' said Daniel Berrigan, 68, of
New York, displaying a toothbrush he was carrying.
   The other defendants were the Rev. Carl Kabat, 56, of Baltimore;
attorney John Schuchardt, 45, of Madison, Conn.; Dean Hammer, 35,
of New Haven, Conn.; Elmer Maas, 51, of New York; Molly Rush, 57,
of Pittsburgh; and Anne Montgomery, 62, of New York.
   The convictions stemmed from a protest on Sept. 9, 1980, at the
General Electric Co. plant in King of Prussia. The defendants took
hammers to the nose cones of two Minuteman 3 nuclear missiles and
poured blood on papers.
   Claiming they didn't get a fair trial, the defendants appealed
through state and federal courts. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
hear the case in October.
   ``We did not act out of anarchy, but out of a belief that men
shall not kill,'' Maas told the judge. ``We shun the use of killing
and violence as a way to protect power.''
   Maas is serving a prison sentence for another protest. Two other
defendants, Kabat and Ms. Montgomery, are also serving prison terms
for protests.
   ``I am sorry that all of us didn't go free and I was sorry to
see our three friends leave the courtroom in handcuffs,'' Daniel
Berrigan said.
   The judge formally sentenced the defendants to minimum sentences
equal to time already served. But he said law-breaking in a future
protest would be a violation of parole that would return them to
prison.
   He asked each of the defendants whether they planned to continue
their protests. None ruled it out.
   Kabat, who has been in jail for 5{ years, said, ``I would
certainly rest for awhile.''
   The defendants took their name from the biblical prophecy that
swords will be beaten into plowshares.
   In a statement, the defendants said ``We saw our action as one
of hope for the future and gratitude for God's creation which was,
and is, under threat of planetary extinction. We wanted our action
to ring with the truth that everyone can take responsibility for
the weapons produced in our name.''
   Outside the courthouse, scores of supporters held a vigil.
   ``If first-rate weaponry like nuclear missiles are judged within
the law and what we did is outside of it, so be it and we will go
to prison in good spirit,'' Daniel Berrigan told the judge.
   Hammer said the judge ``should choose against nuclear weapons
rather than punishing the defendants.''
   ``Somehow governments have the right to act insanely,'' he said.
``If an individual acted like the government he or she would be
locked away. What we did was right.''

<TEXT>
   A lawmaker proposed adding a
declaration of children's rights to Florida's Constitution but the
idea was tabled when other legislators said they couldn't guarantee
``freedom from want'' for children.
   The amendment discussed Tuesday by the House Children &amp; Youth
Committee outlines rights to food, housing, clothing, medical care,
education and protection from abuse, neglect and exploitation.
   Republicans praised the sponsor, Rep. Mike Langton,
D-Jacksonville, for his motives but went on to express doubts.
   ``History has shown that there are events beyond anyone's
control _ famines and disease and war and all kinds of things that
occur that don't guarantee us this,'' said Rep. David Troxler of
Jacksonville.
   The amendment would generate lawsuits from children who thought
their needs weren't met, said Rep. J. Bruce Hoffman of South Miami.
   The proposal could ``encourage families to abandon their own
responsibilities,'' said Rep. Richard Graham, R-Ormand Beach.
   One of the panel's six Republicans, Rep. Tim Ireland of Cape
Coral, offered an amendment to strike the phrase ``guaranteed
freedom from want.'' But after it was approved on a voice vote,
Langton, the chairman of the committee, asked that it be
rescheduled so that he would have time to consult with committee
members on the wording.
   A staff report concluded that the state needs almost $1 billion
more to implement the children's services now mandated by law.
   ``There's so much unmet need out there ... that if we don't make
a statement that they shall be guaranteed these rights, I don't
think they ever will be,'' Langton said.

   The dollar fell in early European trading today on
the heels of Tuesday's sharp drop in New York. Gold prices also
fell.
   ``The market was taken by surprise and a lot of people were
caught out with long dollar positions,'' said one trader in Milan,
Italy.
   Unconfirmed rumors that the credit rating for a major U.S. bank
had been lowered sparked a dollar selloff Tuesday that bumped the
currency below the 1.69 West German mark level.
   Currency dealers said this, combined with more positive comments
from West German officials about unification with East Germany,
encouraged heavy selling of the dollar against the Deutsche mark in
the Far East early today.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann helped the mark
rally by predicting it would rise after monetary union between the
two Germanys, provided East Germany introduces a free-market
economy.
   The Japanese yen remained weak despite last weekend's Group of
Seven meeting in Paris. Market analysts say some G-7 nations regard
the yen's weakness as a domestic problem and are reluctant to help
the currency rise unless Japanese financial authorities take
further steps, such as raising domestic interest rates.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 158.50 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 158.25 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6778 West German marks, down from 1.6900
   _1.4890 Swiss francs, down from 1.4955
   _5.6400 French francs, down from 5.6750
   _1.9054 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9030
   _1,233.00 Italian lire, down from 1,240.00
   _1.1595 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1613
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6402, compared with $1.6345 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $374.25 a troy ounce,
down from $375.15 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $374.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $373.70, down from $375.25 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.84 to close at a bid $375.13.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.09 a troy ounce, from
Tuesday's $5.13.

   A student died today of injuries he
suffered in street battles between supporters of rival political
parties, and thousands of troops hit the streets to try to avert
more bloodshed.
   Hundreds of wailing people had camped outside a city hospital
where Najeem Ahmad, 22, had been in a coma since Friday.
   Authorities said up to 10,000 troops were deployed after his
death was announced to prevent any retaliatory acts by his
supporters, who blame a rival political party that represents
Indian immigrants.
   Ahmad belonged to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan
People's Party.
   Meanwhile, the militant leader of the Indian immigrants, Altaf
Hussein, pressed on with a hunger strike he began to demand the
release of 21 supporters arrested in Friday's violence.
   Thousands of wailing supporters have kept a vigil outside
Hussein's home, and doctors weaved their way through their
prostrate bodies to check on the hunger striker.
   As many as 60 people have died in the last month in pitched
battles between supporters of Ms. Bhutto and Hussein.
   A one-time ally of Ms. Bhutto, Hussein's Mohajir Qami Movement
switched allegiances in November when he gave his party's 14
National Assembly votes to the opposition. The defections led to a
no-confidence vote, which Ms. Bhutto narrowly survived.
   Rivalries between the Pakistan People's Party and the Indian
immigrants' movement erupted in violence in early February when 47
people were killed and scores injured in a single day of shooting.
   There were sporadic gunfights until Friday, when a 24-hour
shooting spree left 17 people dead and 55 wounded, including Ahmad.
Police arrested 30 people.
   Troops were ordered into central Karachi on Sunday after Hussein
began his hunger strike, and today several took up positions
outside Karachi's civic center, the busiest intersection in this
port city of 8 million.
   Hussein has demanded the release of 20 of his followers as well
as a Karachi municipal councilor, Khalid Bin Walid, who was
arrested in connection with the shooting of Ahmad. Walid belongs to
Hussein's party.
   So far the Sindh province government, dominated by Ms. Bhutto's
party, has refused Hussein's demands.

<TEXT>
   King Birendra has withdrawn from politics
and wants the government to ease the hostility and bitterness
caused by the bloody crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, the
foreign minister said today.
   State radio said all charges would be dropped against activists
arrested since the movement began on Feb. 18. The opposition says
about 300 political prisoners are in jail.
   Foreign Minister Pashupati Rana's comments were the first on the
king's role in Nepal's new multiparty system, which Birendra
established on Sunday by lifting a 29-year ban on political parties.
   Rana told reporters talks were continuing with a centrist party
and a left-wing coalition on the formation of a provisional
government.
   The Nepali Congress Party and the United Left Front said Tuesday
that they would not participate in the proposed government unless
the current partyless national assembly, the Rashtriya Panchayat,
is dissolved.
   The two parties led the seven-week pro-democracy campaign that
forced Birendra to establish a multiparty system.
   Rana refused to give details about the talks. ``Allow us the
privacy of dialogue ... if you want the process of orderly and
democractic Nepal to continue.''
   ``For 29 years there was virtually no dialogue, no discussion.
We hardly knew each other. We settled that in two days. From a
highly troubled situation, we brought the country to a fairly
stable situation,'' he said.
   Political parties were banned in Nepal in 1961 when the
democratically elected government headed by the Nepali Congress
Party was sacked by Birendra's father, Mahendra, ending Nepal's
only experiment with Western-style democracy.
   The king has wielded power through a largely rubber-stamp
government and a national assembl dominated by his nominees.
   The Congress Party went underground and continued to campaign
for multiparty democracy.
   A left-wing coalition joined it on Feb. 18, setting off a
popular movement supported by academicians, doctors, engineers,
pilots and peasants.
   The government last cracked down on Friday, when troops fired on
200,000 demonstrators as they marched on the royal palace.
Witnesses said at least 200 were killed; the government said 10
people were killed and 107 injured.
   ``For one-and-a-half months a period of harshness, of great
casualties, of great loss of lives has gone through this country.
We want to heal these wounds to soothe anybody's feelings wherever
they are hurt,'' Rana said.
   Rana said the king, by removing a reference to the ban on
parties in the constitution, has ``relinquished participation in
active politics.''
   State-run radio continued to refer to the government as ``his
majesty's.''
   To a question on the king tolerating criticism of the monarchy,
Rana said: ``Freedom of expression has been established. ... It is
more likely that there would be praise of the king.''
   Under Nepalese law, the press or citizens are not allowed to
criticize the institution of monarchy and the royal family,
although criticism of the government is tolerated. Reporters who
have broken the law have been jailed.
   Birendra, 44, is the heir of the Shaha dynasty, which has held
the throne since the middle of the 18th century.
   Many Nepalis, especially farmers who comprise the bulk of this
country's 17 million people, view him as the reincarnation of the
Hindu god, Vishnu.

<TEXT>
   Chippewa Indians began their annual
spearfishing harvest of walleyed pike while deputy sheriffs
patrolled the lake to keep taunting picketers at a distance.
   About 400 people, some in favor and some opposed to the tribe's
treaty rights, debated beside Cedar Lake in western Wisconsin as
the two tribal boats paddled about Tuesday night.
   ``There were a few intelligent conversations between Indians and
non-Indians,'' said Bill Means, a member of the American Indian
Movement contingent on hand to support the tribal fishermen.
   More than 100 law enforcement officials, including two dozen in
riot helmets, patrolled the shores of the lake.
   Since 1983, federal courts have upheld the 19th century treaties
that allow Chippewa to hunt and fish on public property in the
northern third of Wisconsin. Treaty critics call the rulings unfair
to non-Chippewa hunters and fishermen, complaining the spring
spearing depletes the supply of walleye.
   During the season last year, about 200 protesters were arrested
after confrontations that included rock throwing and racial insults.
   Temperatures were in the 30s and 40s on Tuesday, too cold for
walleye to leave Cedar Lake's depths in great numbers. The season
generally begins when the fish begin spawning in the shallows,
where they are easily speared in the glare of spotlights mounted on
boats. The season lasts for several weeks.
   Of two St. Croix boats with two fishermen each, the first to
return reported catching 10 walleye of one pound or less apiece,
and two largemouth bass.
   One of the spearers, Lorne Pewaush, 19, of rural Hertle said the
fish will feed his family.
   Rick Jett, a treaty defender from Rhinelander, said his car was
forced off a road by pickup truck.
   ``I got his license number and gave it to the police,'' he said.

   Pope John Paul II has accepted the
resignation of Mother Teresa as head of the religious order she
founded to care for the sick and poor in Calcutta, India, the
Vatican announced today.
   Deputy Vatican spokesman Monsignor Piero Pennacchini said Mother
Teresa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her charity work,
submitted her resignation for health reasons and was happy to turn
over the reigns to ``younger hands.''
   The 79-year-old nun was hospitalized last year for heart
troubles, and surgeons implanted a permanent pacemaker on Dec. 1.
Pennachini noted that Mother Teresa was no longer able to leave
Calcutta to visit her missions in other parts of the world.
   Mother Teresa, who was born in Yugoslavia, founded the
Missionaries of Charity in 1950 in Calcutta's squalid slums. The
order, recognized by the Vatican in 1965, expanded and now has
3,000 nuns working to help the poor in 87 countries.
   A new head of the order will be elected in Calcutta on Sept. 8,
Pennachini said.

   The dramatic turnaround was a major embarrassment for Peres, who
only hours before had predicted he would have a 61-60 majority in
the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, and had named his candidates
for the proposed Cabinet.
   Peres, who had vowed to make peace talks with Palestinians his
first priority, told President Chaim Herzog in a letter that he
would need more time.
   Peres' bid to form a coalition fell apart when two hard-line
members of the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel Party backed out. The
defectors oppose a government that depends on Arab members of the
parliament for support and they also reject the return of occupied
land in exchange for peace.
   Pandomonium broke out in parliament when it became clear that
Peres lacked a majority, and lawmakers shouted and wagged fingers
at each other.
   At one point, four security guards surrounded a right-wing
lawmaker who appeared to threaten Arab parliament member Abdul
Wahab Daroushe.
   Parliament Speaker Dov Shilansky, a member of the right-wing
Likud bloc, ruled there would be no point in going forward with a
vote after reading a letter from Peres saying Labor had failed in
its attempt to form a government.
   Shilanksy rejected calls by Likud supporters to go ahead with
the vote, which could have further embarrassed Peres with a tie or
a loss.
   ``I do not believe that there is any point in inviting Peres to
the podium to present his government since he announced that it is
not in his hands,'' Shilansky said.
   He said he lacked the authority to grant Peres an extension of
48 hours, which was sought by Labor. The ruling left the decision
in the hands of the president.
   Herzog, who granted Peres three weeks to form a government on
March 20, is empowered to grant Peres an extension of up to 21 days.
   Peres supporters said he would request up to three weeks more.
The president's office said Peres was expected to visit later in
the day.
   Meanwhile, Israel radio reported efforts were under way to bring
together another Labor-Likud coalition in which Yitzhak Rabin of
Labor and the incumbent Yitzhak Shamir of Likud would each take
turns being prime minister.
   Asked about the possibility, Peres said on Israel Television
that he had received a mandate from the party to form a government
that would give a positive reply to U.S. Secretary of State James
A. Baker's proposals for a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.
   He said he had asked the Agudat Israel Party if it could still
guarantee him the backing of all five of its parliament members
after the two hard-liners, Avraham Verdiger and Eliezer Mizrahi,
announced they would oppose a Labor-led coalition.
   Earlier, Peres declined to tell reporters his plans but said:
``I think I have a chance'' when asked if he could still form a
government.
   Labor sources said Peres needed an extra two days to give the
Augudat Israel Party time to replace or bring into line Verdiger
and Mizrahi.
   Verdiger announced his resignation from parliament. It would
take two days for his resignation to take effect, after which he
could be replaced.
   Mizrahi said that as an act of conscience he would oppose a
Labor-led government despite his party's decision to accept Peres.
   ``For the peace and safety of the 3 million Jews of this
country, I oppose the government,'' said Mizrahi.
   In this predominantly secular country, Agudat Israel and other
small religious parties hold disproportionate sway by virtue of the
split between the country's two major forces _ Labor and the
right-wing Likud bloc.
   In recent days, people have staged mass rallies and hunger
strikes demanding electoral reform, such as direct election of the
prime minister.

<HEAD>Perjury Charges Dismissed Against Former PTL Minister</HEAD>

   A federal judge has dismissed perjury
charges against a former PTL pastor for lack of evidence.
   The Rev. Sam Johnson was accused of lying to a federal grand
jury in 1987 and 1988, saying he did not remember where he got
$10,000 in cash to lend former PTL top executive Richard Dortch.
That money was to pay for former church secretary Jessica Hahn's
silence about a 1980 sexual encounter with ministry founder Jim
Bakker.
   Bakker is serving 45 years at a Minnesota prison after being
convicted in October of mail and wire fraud and conspiracy.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter dismissed the charges Tuesday,
saying, ``I think I'm afraid if I let it go to the jury I would
cause this defendant to have to go through the appeals process.''
   Johnson, 50, hugged his wife, Joyce, and sobbed when Potter
announced the decision after both sides presented their cases.
   ``I feel born again. Friday's coming and Easter's not far away.
For me, I'm glad it came early,'' Johnson said outside the
courthouse.
   Jerry Miller, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted Bakker
and who testified Tuesday about Johnson's statements to the grand
jury, said he thought the government's case went as well as he
expected.
   ``Judge Potter obviously had a difficult call to make,'' Miller
said. ``We stated our position. He disagreed. That's his function.''
   Johnson reiterated his testimony that he never denied making the
loan to Dortch and never denied that the funds could have come from
mission funds or another source.
   Earlier in the day a former PTL executive testified that Johnson
used church offerings to provide the money paid to Ms. Hahn.
   David Taggart, a former Bakker aide serving 18 years in prison
for tax evasion, said he attended part of a meeting in which Dortch
arranged the loan with Johnson.
   Dortch is serving eight years in prison. He pleaded guilty in
August to mail and wire fraud and conspiracy, and agreed to testify
against Bakker in a plea bargain with prosecutors.
   ``Reverend Dortch shared with Sam Johnson that a woman had
alleged she had been raped and that money was needed for
psychological counseling,'' Taggart testified.
   Taggart said Johnson then agreed to lend him the $10,000 and
said the money would come from church offerings.
   Johnson had been charged with 12 counts of perjury and faced
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted.

   A leading Iranian newspaper today said
the release of three Western hostages in Lebanon should be a
prelude to freedom for all hostages because keeping people captive
contradicts Islamic teachings.
   It was the third time in as many months that the Tehran Times
had advocated the release of Western hostages held in Lebanon by
militant pro-Iranian groups.
   ``In fact, the issue of hostage-taking should come to an end for
all with no discrimination,'' said an editorial in the newspaper,
which often reflects the opinions of President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   Rafsanjani and other Iranian moderates have stressed their
support for releasing the hostages held in Lebanon, seeing it as a
way of improving ties with the West at a time Iran seeks financing
and technical aid.
   But radical hard-liners, who apparently hold greater sway over
those holding the hostages, have repeatedly said they support
hostage-taking as a way to confront the ``corrupt'' West.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency carried excerpts of
the Tehran Times editorial, which said Iran was working to get all
hostages freed.
   Iran finances Hezbollah, or Party of God, the umbrella group for
the Shiite Moslem factions holding most of the 18 Western hostages
in Lebanon.
   Frenchwoman Jacqueline Valente, 32, Belgian Fernand Houtekins,
43, and their daughter, Sophie-Liberte, 2, were released Tuesday by
the Palestinian terrorist group led by Abu Nidal and flown to Paris.
   The Tehran Times said it hoped their release was ``a prelude to
freedom of all hostages regardless of their nationality, religion
and belief.''
   The Libya-backed guerrilla group held them for nearly 2{ years
after grabbing them from a yacht off the Gaza Strip in 1987.
Palestinian sources said the three had arrived in Lebanon from
Libya by boat days before their release.
   Because they were believed held in Libya, their case is
considered unrelated to the 18 Westerners held in Lebanon. The fate
of those hostages is believed linked to a power struggle in the
Iranian government.
   The hostages in Lebanon include eight Americans, four Britains,
two West Germans, two Swiss, and Irishman and an Italian.
   The longest-held is Terry Anderson, the 42-year-old chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press who was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   Most have been held for more than three years.
   Hostage Brian Keenan, an Irishman who taught English at the
American University of Beirut, marked his fourth year as a hostage
today with no word on his whereabouts.
   No group has claimed to hold the 39-year-old from Belfast, but
he was seen kidnapped by gunmen as he walked to the university
campus on April 11, 1986, shortly after he took up his teaching
post in Beirut's Moslem sector.
   The Tehran Times said a large number of Moslems held in Israeli
jails should also be considered hostages because they were
imprisoned without due process. Freedom for hundreds of Lebanese
Shiite Moslems jailed in Israel has been a repeated demand of all
the groups claiming to hold Western hostages.
   The other demand has been freedom for 15 men, some related to
influential Shiites in Lebanon, jailed in Kuwait. They have been
imprisoned since 1983 for bombing attacks on the French and
American embassies. Kuwait has said their prison sentences are not
negotiable.

   United Nations peacekeeping troops
have arrived in Honduras to begin disbanding the Contra rebels,
while the ruling Sandinistas warned there could be renewed fighting.
   A contingent of 170 Venezuelan paratroopers arrived Tuesday in
Honduras, where the Contras have base camps.
   Their Spanish commander, Gen. Agustin Quesada Gomez, said
Venezuela will send 700 soldiers. They will be joined by troops
from several other countries.
   The United Nations observer force will supervise the
demobilization in both Honduras and in Nicaragua and the
destruction of their U.S.-supplied arms.
   The Contras on Nicaraguan territory are supposed to gather in
``safety zones'' once the U.N. peacekeeping force can ensure a
cease-fire. About 9,000 Contras have gone back to Nicaragua in
recent months, leaving the Honduran camps nearly deserted.
   The rebels agreed Monday to begin disbanding the remains of the
Honduran force on April 18, but have not set a deadline for
demobilization inside Nicaragua. The Sandinistas were pessimistic
about demobilization Tuesday.
   The leftist party's newspaper Barricada and the pro-Sandinista
daily El Nuevo Diario ran editorials and stories calling the accord
nothing but a ploy to gain time and influence before the April 25
inauguration of Nicaragua's conservative president-elect, Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro.
   They also accused the rebels and her United National Opposition
of trying to take over the Sandinista People's Army.
   ``Unless this situation is resolved in the briefest term ... all
the efforts for peace and reconciliation could ... revert into a
fresh outbreak of the war,'' Barricada said.
   Barricada's editorials are considered the official Sandinista
party line.
   The war between the U.S.-backed Contras and the Sandinistas has
killed an estimated 30,000 people since it began in 1981, two years
after the Sandinistas came to power in a revolution that toppled
rightist dictator Anastasio Somoza.

<TEXT>
   Forty inmates at a maximum-security
prison attacked guards and took one hostage, officials said today.
The prison was the 12th in Britain to be hit by violence this month.
   Two guards were injured in the incident Tuesday night, and a
group of inmates continued to hold their hostage this morning,
according to a statement by the Scottish Office, which operates
Scottish prisons.
   The office said the hostage, 30-year-old prison guard Jim
Rankin, appeared to be unharmed. Scores of police arrived as
authorities began negotiations with inmates to try to secure his
release.
   The Scottish Office said the 40 inmates involved smashed up
cells before barricading themselves in on the second floor of B
Hall at the Shotts Prison near the southwest Scottish port of
Glasgow.
   The prison was built three years ago and has 434 prisoners.
There was no immediate explanation for the violence. Other riots
this month took place at aging, overcrowded prisons.
   Shotts is the 12th British prison or young offenders'
institution to be hit by violence since April 1, when inmates
rioted at Strangeways Prison in the northern English city of
Manchester.
   Authorities at Strangeways said less than 20 prisoners today
were still on the loose inside the prison refusing to surrender.
   One prisoner in Strangeways awaiting trial on charges of
indecently assaulting three children died from injuries he received
at the hands of other inmates. Relatives of inmates in the
122-year-old prison complained of overcrowding, unsanitary
conditions and prisoners kept locked in their cells for up to 23
hours a day.
   In copycat violence, rioting subsequently occurred at Dartmoor
Prison in southwest England, and prisons at Bristol in western
England, Cardiff in Wales, Hull in northeast England, Leeds in
northern England, and London's Pentonville and Brixton prisons.
   Rioting also occurred at three young offenders' institutions.

<HEAD>Solidarity Chief Backs Away from Presidential Declaration</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to ADD likely date for presidential election,
new translation on Walesa quote on reaction to announcement,
details on Walesa seeking Solidarity chairmanship, CORRECTS date of
next parliamentary vote.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told
reporters today that his announcement that he would run for
president was misconstrued and that he meant only to encourage more
rapid reform.
   Walesa said his ``metaphor'' about running for president, in
comments to the official Polish news agency on Tuesday, was a
warning to the government to work faster in transforming Poland
from a Communist to a democratic system.
   Nevertheless, politicians in Poland expressed little doubt today
that Walesa would run for president, with the only question being
when the voting would take place.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski's term is not due to end until
1995, but there is a strong possibility that a general election for
president will be moved up as part of an overhaul of the Polish
Constitution.
   The most likely time for elections appears to be spring 1991,
when Poland would be marking the 200th anniversary of its first
written constitution.
   Jaruzelski is a former head of the now-dissolved Communist Party
that ruled Poland until popular forces led by Solidarity won
control of the government last year.
   He was elected by a Parliament seated after elections that were
only partially free and under an arrangement that allowed his
allies to hold on to the Defense and Interior Ministries in the
Solidarity-led government.
   It had been widely expected that Walesa would seek to force
Jaruzelski's early resignation.
   There has been no comment from Jaruzelski or his aides about a
Walesa presidential bid. Jaruzelski began a trip to the Soviet
Union today.
   Walesa, speaking with reporters today during a visit to his
Gdansk union headquarters by Czechoslovak Deputy Premier Jan
Carnogursky, predicted his remarks would lead to a political
backlash.
   ``As a result of the announcement, I will surely not become
president,'' Walesa said. He then stressed that his ``signal'' was
aimed more at quickening the pace of reforms than putting himself
into the president's office.
   ``The slogan in which I say that Lech Walesa is ready to run for
president means that he wants to speed up reforms, so that the
reforms are quicker and better, not that Lech Walesa wants to take
the post of president,'' he said.
   Walesa added that his remarks to a reporter from the Polish
press agency had been misconstrued.
   ``Today on radio and TV, I hear that Lech Walesa agreed to be
president. I didn't say so at all,'' he said. ``I simply did not
guard my tongue enough somewhere.''
   The verbal retreat from his declaration of candidacy was vintage
Walesa, who typically is circumspect in discussing his political
moves and often makes seemingly contradictory statements.
   For instance, he hinted repeatedly in August that he would be
Solidarity's candidate for prime minister, a factor that helped
persuade two smaller parties long allied with the Communists to
support a Solidarity-dominated government.
   In the end, Walesa handed the union nod to adviser Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, who became the East bloc's first non-Communist prime
minister.
   ``The fact that Walesa intends to run for president of the
Polish Republic is not a surprise for me,'' Labor Party leader
Wladyslaw Sila-Nowicki said in today's editions of the newspaper
Rzeczpospolita.
   ``The circles connected with Lech Walesa have long been
disclosing such intentions of the Solidarity chairman,'' said Marek
Jurek, a Solidarity parliament deputy.
   At least one Solidarity deputy, Aleksander Malachowski, said
Mazowiecki would be a better candidate for president.
   The discussion of a presidential bid by Walesa comes just days
before the Solidarity labor union is due to hold its first national
congress in nine years.
   Walesa has said he is committed to winning re-election as
Solidarity chairman at next week's congress. But he is expected to
face a challenge from union members who feel Solidarity has strayed
from its original ideals of 1980 by putting politics ahead of
trade-union goals such as defending workers' interests.
   Walesa has also found himself in conflict with the Mazowiecki
government, which he has accused of acting too slowly in
privatizing the state-dominated economy and removing other remnants
of the old Communist system.
   In general, Solidarity members of Parliament and the government
have been content to move more slowly toward new voting for
Parliament and the presidency.
   The main argument for delaying new elections is that for the
present a nationwide campaign would be too divisive and distract
energies from the fundamental task of restructuring the economy and
local governments.
   Local government elections are scheduled for May 27 and the next
parliamentary vote is not due until 1993.
   Those close to Walesa have argued for holding elections more
quickly because of public impatience for political change during a
time of great economic sacrifice.

<TEXT>
   Eight blacks were killed,
including six by police fire, in dozens of clashes in black
townships across the country, police said today.
   The police unrest report, which covered incidents from Monday
night through this morning, listed 56 instances of violence
nationwide, all in black areas.
   Today's unrest report was one of the lengthiest yet since
violence erupted in black areas two months ago. More than 400
people have died, most of them in black factional fighting in the
southeastern province of Natal.
   Six men died when police said they used combinations of
shotguns, pistols, rubber bullets and tear gas at six separate
locations to disperse mobs or ward off attackers. Three of the
police shootings were in Natal Province, two in Transvaal province,
and one in Cape Town.
   Two blacks were killed by mobs in separate incidents in Natal,
police added.
   Police also said more than 200 people were arrested and dozens
injured.
   Many of the incidents involved stone-throwing and the setting
alight of vehicles, private homes and government offices in black
areas.
   Some 4,000 people have died in the Natal fighting since 1986.
The main combatants are supporters of the African National Congress
and Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu organization. Both
organizations have large numbers of youthful supporters they cannot
control.
   The King Edward VIII Hospital in the port city of Durban said it
was so overcrowded due to the Natal fighting that it has
temporarily stopped admitting patients in need of surgery, even
emergency cases.
   ``We simply cannot carry out any more surgery,'' said the
hospital superintendent, Dr. A.M. Seedat. ``We have reached a
situation where we cannot take on a single extra patient.''
   Other hospitals in the areas also are at or near capacity due to
the recent fighting.

   Labor leader Shimon Peres failed today to
present a new government to parliament for approval after two
members of an ultra-Orthodox religious party defected from his
coalition at the last minute.
   The dramatic turnaround was a major embarrassment for Peres, who
only hours before had predicted he would have a 61-60 majority in
the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, and had named his candidates
for the proposed Cabinet.
   Peres, who had vowed to make peace talks with Palestinians his
first priority, told President Chaim Herzog in a letter that he
would need more time. Herzog gave him 15 more days to forge a
coalition.
   Herzog said in a statement that the recent political
maneuverings raised ``piercing questions about our system of
government and our political culture,'' and that Israel eventually
would have to face these questions.
   The wheeling and dealing of forming the government has brought
loud public complaints that Israel's electoral system must be
changed so that small parties are not the controlling factor.
   Peres' bid to form a coalition fell apart when two hard-line
members of the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel Party backed out. The
defectors oppose a government that depends on Arab members of the
parliament for support and they also reject the return of occupied
land in exchange for peace.
   Asked about the last-minute defection by the two religious
lawmakers, Peres told reporters: ``They can change their minds, but
what pained me was that they did it this morning.''
   Pandemonium broke out in parliament when it became clear that
Peres lacked a majority, and lawmakers shouted and wagged fingers

   At one point, four security guards surrounded a right-wing

   Shilanksy rejected demands by Likud supporters to go ahead with

a loss.
   ``I do not believe that there is any point in inviting Peres to
the podium to present his government since he announced that it is
not in his hands,'' Shilansky said.
   Meanwhile, Israel radio reported efforts were under way to bring
together another Labor-Likud coalition in which Yitzhak Rabin of
Labor and the incumbent Yitzhak Shamir of Likud would each take
turns being prime minister.
   Asked about the possibility, Peres said on Israel Television

   State Treasurer Ann Richards emerged
victorious from a mudslinging Democratic gubernatorial runoff,
setting up a November election battle that pundits quickly dubbed
``Claytie and the Lady.''
   Ms. Richards now faces millionaire oilman-rancher Clayton
Williams, who cruised to the GOP nomination with 61 percent of the
primary vote March 13.
   Republican Gov. Bill Clements did not seek re-election.
   ``I have seen demolition derbies much like (this),'' Ms.
Richards said of her down-and-dirty race against Attorney General
Jim Mattox.
   She claimed her victory represented a condemnation of negative
campaigning by Mattox, who kept charging that Ms. Richards was
unfit to govern because of her refusal to say whether she had used
illegal drugs.
   ``We certainly did put to rest the whole business of the
mudslinging in this campaign. I think the people of Texas rejected
that. That's one of the reasons I feel so good about this coming
November,'' she said.
   With 100 percent of the ballots counted, Ms. Richards had
639,126, or 57 percent, to Mattox's 479,384, or 43 percent.
   It was Mattox's first election loss since 1966, when he fell
three votes short in a contest for Democratic precinct chairman.
Since then, he had won elections to the Texas House, Congress and
two terms as attorney general.
   The Richards-Mattox faceoff was a mean-spirited one. Ms.
Richards responded to the drug charges with claims that Mattox had
profited from public service. She repeatedly challenged him to
release his income tax returns.
   Mattox challenged Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, to
release medical records from her alcoholism treatment in 1980.
   The last week of the campaign brought newspaper reports that
Mattox was seen smoking marijuana in the mid-1970s and that Ms.
Richards was seen in a restroom where marijuana allegedly was being
smoked in 1979. Both dismissed the reports.
   But Ms. Richards and Mattox quickly started the kiss-and-make-up
process for the fight against Williams.
   ``There were other people in this primary who did not support
our cause ... And it is time now that we reach out to them and tell
them that we must be unified,'' Ms. Richards said.
   Mattox pledged to help. ``Ann Richards has proven she's a very
strong candidate, proven that she can overcome this drug problem,''
he said. ``Clayton Williams doesn't need to be governor of Texas.''
   Williams and the Republicans held their own rally Tuesday night
in San Antonio. He indicated that Ms. Richards' refusal to say yes
or no to questions of ever using illegal drugs wouldn't be an issue
come fall.
   ``The rehash of the Democratic campaign is of no interest to me.
Read my lips: No more mud,'' said Williams, who earlier had voiced
some reluctance about facing a woman. ``I think what we'll be
talking about _ and I hope Ann will join me _ is a real discussion
of whose philosophy is the best way to win the war on drugs.''
   Ms. Richards echoed the Republican's sentiments.
   ``Both Clayton Williams and I will work very hard to keep this
an ideological campaign where we really do focus on the issues
because we do have disagreements on the issues,'' she said.
   Williams spent more than $8 million _ $6 million from his own
pocket _ in winning the GOP nomination.
   But Ms. Richards insisted she isn't worried about being outspent
by a Republican ticket that also will include the well-funded U.S.
Sen. Phil Gramm.
   ``I doubt seriously if we can match him dollar-for-dollar. But I
don't think the governor's mansion is for sale,'' she said. ``In
the first primary, I got 50,000 more votes than Clayton Williams
and he spent eight times what I did.''

<HEAD>Rehnquist Refuses to Block Rebroadcast of Hilary Foretich
Documentary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist refused
today to block rebroadcast of part of a cable television
documentary about the child-custody battle over Hilary Foretich.
   Rehnquist rejected a request to keep a four-minute segment of
the telecast off the air.
   The request was made by Nathan Lewin, a lawyer appointed to
protect the interests of Hilary, 7.
   Lewin said each time the segment is aired it violates Hilary's
privacy rights by letting more viewers see footage ``likely to be
highly distasteful and embarrassing during (Hilary's) entire life.''
   The documentary, first shown in this country on April 6, is
scheduled for rebroadcast Saturday and again April 19 by Lifetime
cable network.
   The documentary chronicles Hilary's odyssey with her maternal
grandparents from Northern Virginia to England to New Zealand to
avoid unsupervised visits with the girl's father, Dr. Eric Foretich.
   A four-minute portion of the British Broadcasting Corp.
documentary, entitled ``Hilary in Hiding,'' shows the girl in a
therapy session in which she demonstrates with dolls alleged sex
abuse by her father. Foretich has denied abusing his daughter.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin ordered the broadcast not to
be shown last week. But hours later the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals overruled Sporkin and allowed the telecast.
   The girl's mother, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, sent Hilary into hiding
after a judge here ordered her to allow Foretich unsupervised
visits with the girl.
   Morgan spent almost two years in jail for refusing to obey the
judge's order.
   The case is Foretich vs. Lifetime Cable, A-701.

   Militant Moslem separatists escalated
their campaign for an independent Kashmir, killing two more
hostages in Srinagar and bombing a crowded commuter train near
Bombay today, police said.
   About 1,000 troops in battle gear were trucked into Srinagar,
the center of the secessionist campaign in the mostly Moslem
northern state bordering Pakistan.
   The bodies of the two hostages were found late Tuesday night,
several hours after the body of another hostage was dumped near a
Srinagar fire station. Their killings brought to at least 259 the
number of people killed in Kashmir since a government crackdown in
January.
   Telephone callers purporting to speak for the ``Mujahedeen
Kashmir,'' or Islamic Holy Warriors of Kashmir, claimed
responsibility for the bombing today that injured 34 people near
the Malad station on the outskirts of Bombay, United News of India
reported.
   Later today, police said they found five crude bombs hidden in a
water tank in another Bombay suburb. It was not immediately known
whether the discoveries were connected with the train bombing.
   The Mujahedeen Kashmir was first heard of Tuesday when it
claimed responsibility for bomb blasts that injured at least nine
policemen in two New Delhi police stations.
   The New Delhi and Bombay bombings were the first time any
Kashmiri separatists had claimed responsibility for attacks outside
Kashmir since the government of predominantly Hindu India launched
a crackdown on the Moslem secessionists Jan. 20.
   Police found the bodies of the vice chancellor of Kashmir
University, Mushir Ul-Haq, and his secretary, Abdul Ghani, dumped
on a road near the city's airport late Tuesday, the police official
said.
   Both men, who were Moslems, had been shot in the back.
   Earlier Tuesday, the body of L.M. Khera, a Hindu industrialist,
was discovered with five bullet wounds.
   ``The dastardly murders ... are the grossest violations of human
rights where innocent persons are being made victims of senseless
externally inspired and motivated violence,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Aftab Seth told reporters in New Delhi.
   All three were kidnapped Friday and threatened with execution if
three top militants were not released. They were the first
civilians not accused of being police informers to be killed by
militants.
   The government had refused to negotiate. It imposed an
around-the-clock curfew after the kidnappings and detained between
300 and 400 people it suspected of links with the secessionist
movement.
   The killings triggered an even tighter crackdown on the
secessionists.
   About 100 Indian army trucks carrying an estimated 1,000
soldiers were seen moving into Srinagar today. The state government
ordered local police and civilians holding curfew passes to stay
off the streets until further notice, said a senior police official
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In New Delhi dozens of members of a Hindu militant group, the
Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Army, marched to the Pakistan Embassy and
held a demonstration.
   ``We will crush Pakistan,'' shouted the demonstrators, who were
prevented from reaching the embassy gate by police.
   The group was formed in March to counter the Moslem
Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, which is leading the secessionist
campaign.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh, in the most aggressive statement yet
by an Indian leader, said Tuesday that India should be
``psychologically prepared'' for an armed conflict with Pakistan
over what he called the Islamic nation's territorial ambitions in
the Kashmir Valley.
   Singh made the comments in Parliament hours after Khera's body
was found. He accused Pakistan of fomenting the insurgency in the
northern state of Jammu-Kashmir and could ``make a limited
intervention.''
   Pakistan ``will not get away with it,'' Singh said. ``You will
have to pay a very heavy price and we have the capability to
inflict this cost.''
   Moslem-dominated Kashmir is a former princely state whose Hindu
ruler opted for union with India in 1947 when the subcontinent was
divided into Hindu-majority India and Islamic Pakistan.
   India and Pakistan fought wars over the region in 1948 and 1965.
A U.N.-monitored cease-fire line separates the valley into Indian
and Pakistani sectors. The two countries also fought a war in 1971
that led to the independence of Bangladesh.

   The captain of the Scandinavian Star
today testified at a maritime inquiry into last weekend's ferry
disaster that he had been awakened by a crewman who told him,
``someone is playing arsonist.''
   Capt. Hugo Larsen also rejected allegations by passengers that
safety was substandard and that his crew of Filipino and Portuguese
sailors was unprepared for an emergency.
   Police in Sweden said they have recovered the bodies of 127
people, but up to 200 people may have died when flames engulfed the
10,500-ton ship on a voyage from Norway to Denmark, in one of the
worst recorded fires at sea.
   On Tuesday, a maritime commission from three Scandinavian
countries agreed to crack down on foreign-flagged ships and tighten
safety regulations for all passenger ferries.
   Larsen said he went to sleep at midnight, but was roused by an
officer at 1:55 a.m. Saturday reporting that woolen blankets were
burning in a passageway on the port side of the ship.
   ``Someone is playing arsonist,'' Larsen quoted the officer as
saying.
   Shortly afterward another crew member reported smoke in the
ship, and fire patrols discovered fires on both sides of the ship
almost simultaneously, Larsen told the inquiry.
   The fire spread ``incredibly fast'' at the midships section, he
said.
   The captain said he had checked safety and fire fighting systems
and the crew underwent a boat drill before the ship's first
Scandinavian voyage on April 1. A fire drill had been planned for
Sunday, the day after the fire destroyed the ship, he said.
   He also rejected charges from passengers, who told reporters the
crewmen could not communicate with them. He said most spoke
``usable English,'' and responded well in the crisis.
   The inquiry, headed by Maritime and Trade Court President Frank
Poulsen, was expected to hear 15 or 20 witnesses. Norwegian police
were heading a separate investigation.
   In Oslo, Norwegian police withdrew a decision to release the
names of 186 people believed dead or missing from the fire on the
voyage to the Danish port Frederikshavn.
   The list was intended to help clear up the mystery of how many
people were on board the 20-year-old ferry when it caught fire.
   But deputy police chief Arne Huuse said families objected that
it would appear more like ``a death list'' than a list of missing
required for the investigation.
   Latest estimates put the number of passengers and crew at 530,
but the figure has changed constantly as bodies were recovered and
the fate of rescued passengers clarified. ``There were instances
where people were listed twice,'' said Oeystein Berger of the Oslo
police.
   In the Swedish port of Lysekil, investigators said the work of
recovering bodies from the fire-gutted ship was slowing as it
became harder to collect the remains.
   ``They are mostly ashes. Sometimes there are two, three or four
people together,'' said police spokesman Leif Skoglund.
   The ferry was towed to Lysekil still smoldering on Saturday
evening. It took until Sunday night to extinguish the fire, which
burned at temperatures reaching 570 degrees, consuming everything
combustible in the midships sections.
   At a meeting late Tuesday, the maritime directors of Sweden,
Norway and Denmark approved tighter measures to inspect ships
flying foreign flags of convenience in Nordic waters.
   About 60 million passengers travel Nordic routes every year,
more than three times the total populations of the three countries.
Twelve ships, including the Nassau-registered Scandinavian Star,
fly foreign flags.
   The commission decided that the foreign-flagged ships should
undergo safety checks by a Nordic maritime authority, said a
statement released by the Danish Maritime Board.
   Until now, primary responsibility for safety standards has been
with the registering country, and foreign-flagged ships were
subjected to spot checks.
   The statement said crews must demonstrate fire fighting
qualifications and training for emergency evacuations. The group
also decided to require complete passenger lists on ferries
traveling at night, it said.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Adults Most Obese in Nation</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CORRECT percent for Wisconsin to 28 percent

<TEXT>
   For a third consecutive year, Wisconsin
adults weighed in as the most obese in a national survey, probably
due to a diet heavy in the state's best-known products: cheese,
butter and bratwurst, a researcher says.
   ``Wisconsin has consistently had the highest percentage of obese
adults among the 37 states surveyed over the past three years,''
said Dr. Patrick Remington, author of a study released Tuesday by
the state Division of Health.
   One million Wisconsin adults, or about 28 percent of the adult
population, are at least 20 percent overweight, the study said.
Women are more likely to be overweight than men.
   Obesity was defined as 20 percent or more above desirable body
weight, Remington said.
   Wisconsin, nicknamed America's Dairyland, was followed by West
Virginia, Indiana, Michigan and North Dakota.
   States with the highest prevalence of obesity ``tended to be in
the Upper Midwest,'' Remington said.
   ``I think that in the Upper Midwest we probably have a higher
intake of dietary fat: cheese, butter, ice cream, bacon, sausages,
bratwursts.''
   Another factor could be the high percentage of ``Germanic and
northern Europeans in our population'' and their greater tendency
to be obese, he said.
   ``If both your parents were obese, you have an 80 percent chance
of being obese,'' he said. ``If neither was obese, your chances are
only 18 percent.''
   The 1988 Behavior Risk Factor Telephone Survey found 30.3
percent of adult women were obese compared with 25.5 percent of
adult men, Remington said.
   For example, a man who is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs more
than 193 pounds would be obese. A woman who is 5-feet-4 and weighs
mmore than 158 pounds would be obese, he said.
   Remington said the prevalence of obesity generally increased
with age for women, peaking in the 45-54 age group and remaining
high among older ages.
   For men, however, the risk of obesity declined among those in
the older age groups, he said.
   Remington said the telephone survey in Wisconsin involved 1,272
telephone contacts. The survey was coordinated through the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control, which provided identical
questionnaires to the states and recommended 1,200 to 1,800 survey
contacts in each state, he said.
   The study contained the following percentages on overweight
adults for the top 20 states:
   Wisconsin, 28 percent of adults obese; West Virginia, 24.4
percent; Indiana, 24.1 percent; Michigan, 24 percent; North Dakota,
23.3 percent; District of Columbia, 23 percent; Kentucky, 23
percent; Missouri, 22.9 percent; South Dakota, 22.9 percent;
Illinois, 22.7 percent; Alabama, 22.5 percent; Nebraska, 22.5
percent; Florida, 22.3 percent; Ohio, 21.9 percent; South Carolina,
21.5 percent; Maine, 21.5 percent; Massachusetts, 21.4 percent;
California, 20.9 percent; Minnesota, 20.9 percent; New York, 20.8
percent.

<TEXT>
   A crowd of 300 Protestant
demonstrators hurled insults at Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey today as he arrived on a rare visit to the British-ruled
province of Northern Ireland.
   Demonstrators gathered outside the Europa Hotel where Haughey
delivered a speech to the Institute of Directors in his capacity as
chairman of the European Community's Council of Ministers.
   The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Protestant Democratic
Unionist Party, and a dozen of his colleagues managed to get
through a huge security cordon around the hotel to the rooftop of
their nearby party headquarters.
   As Haughey's motorcade swept up to the hotel, Paisley and his
group shouted down at him ``Haughey! Haughey! Out! Out! Out!'' and
other taunts.
   The 95 percent Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland lays formal
constitutional claim to predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland.
   Hundreds of police and security officers swarmed the area around
the hotel, closing off roads to keep other demonstrators away.
Marksmen took up positions on nearby rooftops.
   In his speech to business leaders, Haughey focused on economic
issues and made no reference to the protests or to recent violence
in Northern Ireland.
   Newspaper advertisements had urged Protestants to join the
``Haughey is not Welcome'' rally. Despite fears the protests could
turn violent, there were no major scuffles and police said most
demonstrators left after Haughey arrived.

<HEAD>Striking Drivers to Face Charges in Shots Fired at Buses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two striking Greyhound drivers have been
arrested by federal agents and charged with firing shots at a
Greyhound bus last month in Illinois.
   Roy B. Simes, 35, and Harry T. Lewis, 42, both of suburban St.
Louis, were scheduled to appear this afternoon before a U.S.
magistrate in St. Louis who will determine whether they should be
sent to Illinois to face federal charges filed Tuesday in East St.
Louis federal court. They were being held without bond.
   The charges were in connection with a March 22 shooting of a bus
in Collinsville, Ill., just across the state line from St. Louis.
Authorities said Simes and Lewis were also considered suspects in
another bus shooting in Missouri the same day, but no charges were
immediately filed in that incident.
   The two were charged with endangering people on board a vehicle
used in interstate or foreign commerce, commission of a felony with
a firearm that has been transported in interstate commerce and use
of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.
   If convicted, Simes and Lewis could face up to 10 years in jail
and a $10,000 fine. Using a firearm during the commission of a
felony carries a mandatory five-year jail term.
   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms announced
last week it was investigating the more than 30 Greyhound shootings
that have occurred since 6,300 drivers and 3,000 other workers
walked off the job March 2 over wages and job security.
   The men's arrests Tuesday were the second and third nationwide
since a series of shootings involving Greyhound buses began last
month. The other arrest took place March 16, when a striking driver
was accused of shooting at a bus on March 12 near Hartford, Conn.
   Simes admitted he and Lewis were involved in the March 22
shootings involving a bus in Collinsville and one traveling on
Interstate 55 about 12 miles south of St. Louis, Stephen Higgins of
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said in a sworn
statement. The statement said Simes also consented to a search of
his residence and turned over a .22-caliber revolver.
   No one was hurt in either shooting incident.
   Simes has been a Greyhound driver for 12 years and Lewis for 10
years, according to the court documents filed in East St. Louis.
   On Monday, Greyhound Lines Inc. filed a $30 million civil

   Lawrence Singleton, a convicted rapist whose
release from prison sparked a furor in California when several
communities chased him out of town, has been arrested and accused
of trying to steal a $10 camera.
   Singleton, 62, was not jailed after his arrest Sunday at a
Brandon drug store but was given a notice to appear in court May 2
on the misdemeanor charge of petty theft, authorities said.
   A security guard at the Phar-Mor store spotted Singleton taking
a disposable camera from a display, tucking it under his arm and
try to exit the store without paying, a sheriff's report said.
   Singleton was convicted of raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker,
hacking off her arms and leaving her for dead along a remote road
in central California in 1978. He was freed in 1987 after serving
eight years and four months of a 14-year sentence.
   He attempted to live quietly in several California communities
after his release, but public outrage when his identity was
discovered forced authorities to keep moving him for his own
protection. He finally wound up in the Tampa area a year later.
   Singleton told deputies he lives at his sister's house in
eastern Hillsborough County. A woman who answered the telephone
there said Singleton stays alternately with his sister and his
brother, who lives in northwest Tampa. The brother refused to
comment.

<TEXT>
   The French government responded to mounting
criticism today by insisting it had not dealt with terrorists in
negotiating the release of a French woman, her Belgian companion
and their child.
   The three were released in Lebanon by Abu Nidal's Libyan-backed
Palestinian terrorist group on Tuesday after 2{ years in captivity
and flown to France, spending the night at a military hospital
outside Paris.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said negotiations for the release
of the three, who were believed to have been held in Libya, were on
the level of ``state to state.'' He said France ``did not speak
with the abductors.''
   Those who criticized the government's praise for Libyan leader
Col. Moammar Gadhafi for helping to free the three were ``being
picky,'' he said.
   Gadhafi has backed Abu Nidal, who along with some of his
followers has been convicted of terrorist attacks abroad,
reportedly allowing him to live near the Libyan capital of Tripoli.
There have also been reports, however, that the Libyans have
restricted the movements of Abu Nidal and his lieutenants.
   In an editorial today, the conservative newspaper Le Figaro
branded Gadhafi the ``real abductor'' of the newly freed hostages.
   Paul Wilkinson, director of the Research Institute for the Study
of Conflict and Terrorism, said the hostage release proves an
ongoing link between Gadhafi and Abu Nidal.
   ``The public should be warned against euphoria over the latest
hostage release in Lebanon,'' Wilkinson said in London. ``It was
obtained by a deal which violates the European Community policy of
`no concessions under duress to terrorists or their sponsors.'''
   A month ago, France returned to Libya three French-made Mirage
jet fighters that had been in France for repairs since 1986. Libya,
pressing for delivery of the aircraft, closed its ports to French
ships in December.
   In its editorial, Le Figaro said: ``One imagines that the
thank-yous addressed by Roland Dumas to Col. Gadhafi were part of a
`deal' which permitted the end of three years of imprisonment.''
   ``We have been working on this case for months,'' Dumas told
reporters late Tuesday after the hostages' arrival. ``We alerted a
large number of countries, particularly Libya. Our discussions were
only state to state, with respect for the principles which are
ours.''
   Previous releases of French hostages by pro-Iranian Lebanese
groups prompted charges that France barters with terrorists, claims
France has denied.
   State Department officials in Washington welcomed the release
but were critical of France's warm words for Gadhafi.
   ``Such rhetoric is nauseating,'' the British newspaper The
Independent wrote in an editorial criticizing France.
   President Francois Mitterrand had personally thanked Gadhafi for
his ``determining'' role in the releases, and Dumas declared that
tense French-Libyan relations would now improve.
   ``France is being nicer to Libya than we think they should be,''
said one of the State Department officials, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The U.S. officials said France and other countries should press
Libya to expel the group and stop alleged efforts to make chemical
weapons.
   Jacqueline Valente, 32, Fernand Houtekins, 43, and their
2-year-old daughter Sophie-Liberte made no public statements upon
their arrival, refusing to discuss conditions of their captivity or
where they were held. They were taken to a military hospital and
all appeared healthy.
   The three had been dropped off at the French Embassy in Beirut
Tuesday morning by masked gunmen in cars with drawn curtains.
   Ms. Valente and Houtekins were seized in November 1987 from a
French yacht off the Gaza Strip and the Abu Nidal group accused
them of collaborating with Israeli intelligence. Friends said they
were on a holiday cruise.
   Their release leaves four Belgians abducted with them _
Houtekins' brother Emmanuel and his family _ still held hostage.
Two other daughters of Ms. Valente were freed as a result of Libyan
intervention on Dec. 29, 1988.
   Dumas told reporters that French and Belgian authorities
remained in contact for the release of the four.
   Nidal's group linked freedom for them to the release of Nasser
Sa'eed, a Palestinian serving a life term in Belgium for a June
1980 grenade attack on Jewish youths in Antwerp.
   The Belgian government has not responded to the offer.
   Because the hostages were believed to have been held in Libya,
the case is considered unrelated to the 18 Westerners, including
eight Americans, held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
factions.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Gadhafi said Tuesday that the Abu Nidal group was ``distancing''
itself from its terrorist reputation by releasing the hostages,
Libya's official news agency JANA reported.
   The group has been blamed for scores of terrorist acts,
including the December 1985 attacks on Rome and Vienna airports
that killed more than 20 people.

   It should be orbiting 380 miles high
today and looking at the heavens, but instead the $1.5 billion
Hubble Space Telescope rests inside space shuttle Discovery,
shielded from earthly dust and debris.
   The shuttle's launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff
Tuesday because of a malfunctioning power unit, and NASA said the
mission will be attempted again in a week or two. The space agency
needs the time to replace the unit and recharge the telescope's
batteries.
   ``We are certainly concerned about contamination every day that
we're here on Earth, and we will do everything we have done in the
past to assure that we take care of any problem like that,'' said
Fred Wojtalik, a NASA project manager.
   Hubble has a 94-inch mirror that is the finest ever made and
even a speck of dust would impair its efficiency.
   The delay was the latest of many for Hubble, NASA's most
expensive and complex payload. The telescope originally was
scheduled to take its place in space in 1983, but technical
problems and the 1986 Challenger explosion interfered.
   Wojtalik said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
had not decided whether to charge the telescope's nickel-hydrogen
batteries while they are inside the orbiter or at a laboratory.
   Discovery's commander, Loren J. Shriver, said before heading
back to Johnson Space Center in Houston today that he and the other
four astronauts are ``disappointed just like everybody else.''
   ``That's kind of the name of the game,'' he said. ``We go when
the equipment is ready to go, and we're always ready to go.''
   The hundreds of astronomers gathered at Kennedy Space Center for
the launch also went home disappointed.
   ``We came in and it was bad weather, so we had very low
expectations. Then the weather cleared up and it was beautiful and
all our spirits went up with it,'' said Francesco Paresce, a
scientist with the European Space Agency.
   ``Until four minutes, everything was fine and gorgeous. Then
bang, back down to depression. So it's been a swing which is really
incredible,'' he said.
   The countdown had moved uninterrupted to the four-minute mark
when sensors detected that one of three auxiliary power units was
running too fast. Computers halted the launch process.
   ``We don't like to find problems late in the launch count,''
said launch Director Bob Sieck. ``However, when we have problems,
we do like to find them on the ground, and that part of the system
worked.''
   The auxiliary power units pressurize the shuttle's hydraulic
system, which is used to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the
ship's braking and steering systems. NASA forbids a liftoff unless
all three units operate properly.
   NASA will have to remove the 100-pound unit from Discovery while
the shuttle is in an upright position, something the space agency
has never done before. Auxiliary power units have caused
postponements of shuttle launches twice previously, but the work
was performed before the shuttle reached the launch pad.
   Tuesday's scrub cost NASA $377,000 in fuel and $247,000 in labor
and materials. That excludes the cost of other NASA centers
supporting the mission.
   The delay, irksome though it was to many, didn't bother John
Holtzman of the Lowell Observatory at Flagstaff, Ariz.
   ``The universe has been around for a long time,'' he said. ``It
will stay around for a couple more days.''

throughout the country.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on Poindexter:
   Like Oliver North before him, former National Security Adviser
John Poindexter has been convicted of criminal charges growing out
of the Reagan administration's Iran-Contra scandal.
   So, why care? President Reagan's watch has ended. A free
election has been held in Nicaragua. The Ayatollah Khomeini is
dead. Poindexter's and North's military careers have been ruined.
True, American hostages remain prisoners, but why not let the
scandal rest?
   Because, in the name of patriotism, Poindexter and North rode
roughshod over our concept of government as one of laws, not men.
They established a shadow government in the National Security
Council that cavalierly made and carried out secret foreign policy.
In the process, they broke the laws they were pledged to protect.
   That's worth remembering.

   Burlington County Times, Willingboro, N.J., on abortion and
politics:
   It doesn't matter how you stand on abortion, or even if you
elect to avoid the argument altogether, there's one aspect of the
issue that bids to do you harm.
   That's today's tendency to put all the eggs in one political
basket, to vote for or against a candidate strictly on how he or
she stands on abortion. At least one organization actually targeted
New Jersey candidates for defeat at the polls if they did not
measure up to the organization's stand on abortion.
   The National Organization for Women actually tried to boycott an
entire state, Idaho, and a defenseless vegetable, the potato.
   Though the state Legislature passed a restrictive abortion
measure there, Idaho's Gov. Cecil Andrus _ perhaps fearing for the
fiscal health of his fiefdom _ reversed the process with a
last-minute veto.
   We oppose the notion that candidate should be thrown out of
office (or thrown in for that matter) just because of a stand on
one issue.
   The abortion issue is an emotional one, but it has a direct
effect on only a small percentage of marchers on either side,
including those who fail for one reason or another to use readily
available preventive measures.
   Our political system is often perceived as corrupt, but there is
little excuse for our corrupting it deliberately.

   The Press-Enterprise, Riverside, Calif., on ``foreign'' cars:
   The battered American automobile industry received another blow
from its foreign competitors last year when the Honda Accord became
the best-selling car in the United States.
   The Accord is about to set another precedent in the continuing
transformation of the American automobile market: The 1991 models
turned out at Honda's Marysville, Ohio, plant may be officially
designated ``American'' cars by the federal government.
   The Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors the content
and fuel efficiency of all cars sold in the U.S., conveys that
designation on vehicles that have more than 75 percent American
``content'' _ the parts and labor used to build them. ...
   The Japanese cars bought by American consumers are increasingly
built by Americans, often with predominantly American-made parts.
Honda's plants in Ohio, for example, turn out virtually all of the
Honda Civic models sold here and most of the Accords.
   During the past three years, Japanese auto makers have opened
eight manufacturing plants in the United States _ the same number
that the American Big Three has closed during that period. Many of
those displaced Americans now work for Toyota, Nissan and Honda _
the newest immigrants.
   Americans with a true preference for foreign cars might have to
go back to those European models.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on General Motors' Robert
Stempel:
   Let's hope that what's good for General Motors' Robert Stempel
will be good for the country. ...
   Stempel has just been chosen as the new chairman and chief
executive of GM, the largest U.S. corporation. His selection may
suggest something of a change in the attitudes of American big
business. ... Stempel, currently the company's president, is an
engineer _ and, to use automobile industry jargon, a ``product
guy.''
   Most previous leaders of the giant company, including the
departing Roger Smith, have come from the financial side. ...
(Stempel's appointment) may suggest that American business is
giving new emphasis to engineering and product development, and
less to financial ``redeployments'' and other maneuverings. Such a
change would be healthy.
   Further, the selection of a man with ... Stempel's substantial
foreign experience may indicate a heightened corporate appreciation
of the need to succeed in the world marketplace _ where the great
growth of the future is likely to come.
   The appointment of Robert Stempel to lead General Motors may
suggest that American industry is now giving more attention to
these essential elements of corporate _ and national _ success.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on South Africa:
   After decades of injustice, there are signs that South Africa's
racist system of apartheid might crumble. But recent advances have
stalled.
   The United States should increase the pressure on South Africa
to help keep progress coming.
   Tougher U.S. sanctions would give South Africa's black leaders a
stronger bargaining chip in upcoming talks with the white
government.
   Tougher sanctions also would give South African President F.W.
de Klerk the opportunity, if he chooses, to blame the United States
for the need for more changes.
   U.S. sanctions have helped prod South Africa slowly toward a
just society. It's time to step up the pace.

   Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record on immigration reform and
discrimination:
   Comprehensive immigration reform was designed to curtail illegal
immigration. It is not a license to discriminate against
Mexican-Americans or legal aliens or Americans who look or sound
foreign.
   Apparently, however, discrimination has been the unintended
result. According to a recent report by the General Accounting
Office, the Immigration Reform and Control Act has indeed produced
a ``widespread pattern of discrimination.'' Some are having trouble
finding work because employers fear the consequences of the law.
   Congress now must respond. Under the 1986 law, a finding of
``widespread'' discrimination requires lawmakers to reconsider
employer sanctions within the next 30 days. Repealing sanctions is
an option, although less extreme options are available _ and at
this point preferable.
   Illegal immigration continues to be a problem, particularly
along the U.S.-Mexico border area; immigration reform was a
good-faith effort to respond. Now that effort needs to be
calibrated. The law cannot be an excuse to discriminate.

   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on Mississippi delta problems:
   The final report of the Mississippi Delta Development Commission
is due next month. The findings of the commission are being awaited
with interest.
   Congress allocated $3 million to study economic conditions in
impoverished regions of seven states bordering the Mississippi
River _ Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky,
Missouri and Illinois. The study is to be concluded with a 10-year
plan for economic development.
   Even as the report is being finalized, preliminary information
is circulating. Among those recently submitting data were
sociologists Forrest A. Deseran and Joachim Singlemann of Louisiana
State University. Their principal conclusion was that the Delta
region ``stands apart from the mainstream'' and ``if it is to
become competitive in the national economy'' it needs help now.
   To facilitate their study the researchers divided the 214-county
area into 27 labor markets. They found that the top third of the
labor markets compared favorably to national averages. Unemployment
rates and poverty evident in the bottom two-thirds, however, ``show
the extent of the task at hand.''
   In those 18 labor markets, the average unemployment rate is 36
percent higher than the national average, their per capita income
is less than 75 percent of the U.S. total, and their families are
more than twice as likely to be poor as the average American.

   Red Wing (Minn.) Republican Eagle on America's appetite for oil:
   Joseph Hazelwood will be doing his time cleaning up the
oil-soaked shoreline as payment for his role in misguiding the
Exxon Valdez.
   The fiasco of the Exxon Valdez, however, is one tiny piece of a
much bigger issue. That's the gluttony of Americans when it comes
to cheap energy.
   The overconsumption of oil places more pressure on our domestic
sources. That in turn steps up the intensity to rely solely on such
deposits as those along Alaska's North Shore. The tragedy of the
Exxon Valdez taught us all a bitter and long-lasting lesson. It
rightfully has spurred Congress to pursue tougher sanctions such as
mandatory double-hulling of ships to prevent future disasters.
   In the short term, the Valdez incident emphasizes the need for
the industry to hire competent employees and to operate under
stricter standards. In the long run, America must reduce its
appetite for energy if it's to lessen the pressure to take the type
of shortcuts which permitted the tragic accident in Alaska.

   The Independence (Kan.) Daily Reporter on energy savings:
   A recent report on the National Resource Defense Council's new
electricity-frugal headquarters in New York points the way to huge
nationwide energy savings. The technology is available; the payback
time for additional costs is reasonable. What we need is the
national will to do what is required.
   The council, aided by a $100,000 power company grant, spent
$166,000 more than the cost for normal lighting. But it expects to
retrieve that amount in about three years through electricity
savings.
   Congress, whose initiative years ago hastened the development of
more fuel-efficient cars, ought to consider similar legislative
action to prod businesses and speculative builders into following
the NRDC's lead.

   The Joplin (Mo.) Globe on funding the arts:
   Rep. Mel Hancock, R-Mo., is still swinging from the floor in
delivering verbal haymakers to the solar plexus of the federally
subsidized arts. Last week, the southwest Missourian urged a
congressional panel to halt the federal government from bankrolling
the National Endowment for the Arts.
   He disparaged the NEA as just another wasteful bureaucracy _ in
many cases an obscene waste. He complained that federal money had
gone to the arts that he described as ``obscene, indecent,
sacrilegious and racist, which are offensive to the vast majority
of our nation's taxpayers.'' ...
   It has been said that a culture defines itself by the limits it
sets for its people. We sense that either severe constraints are
coming down the pike for the National Endowment for the Arts or
abolishment of the agency. The latter is preferred.

   Shawano (Wis.) Evening Leader on college basketball:
   March Madness lived up to its name this season, with the college
basketball tournament more competitive than it has ever been. But
while the game itself couldn't be healthier, there are still many
problems with a sport that puts such a high price on winning.
   College presidents talk of running clean programs with an
emphasis on players who graduate. Then they turn around and fire
coaches who do both of those things. Why? Because their teams don't
win more often.
   The system that is still being used amounts to nothing more than
a tremendous incentive to cheat. Currently, each of the 64 schools
selected for the NCAA tournament receives upwards of $250,000, with
each ensuing tournament victory worth an additional $250,000.
Schools that advance to the Final Four are raking in over $1
million.
   Unless the system is changed, those numbers are only going to
increase next year, when the NCAA enters into a seven-year, $1
billion TV contract with CBS, in effect tripling the money from the
last contract. ...
   The tournament's growing popularity has nothing to do with the
money involved. It would be followed just as closely if the players
were playing strictly for a championship trophy, and not some
million-dollar check for their school. Besides, there is something
inherently wrong about unpaid amateur athletes earning enormous
sums of money for an institution.
   By simply distributing the $1 billion among all 291 Division I
schools and eliminating the huge financial rewards given to winning
teams, some of the pressures on coaches and athletes would be
removed.

<HEAD>Businesses Planning 7.6 Percent Increase in Spending</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: CORRECTS 4th graf, This year, to make it fourth, sted third,
consecutive increase</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   American businesses plan to increase spending
on plant and equipment by a healthy 7.6 percent this year, the
government said today in a report reflecting renewed optimism about
the economy.
   The Commerce Department said a survey completed in March found
businesses planning to spend $503.4 billion for expansion and
modernization this year.
   If realized, that would surpass the previous record of $467.8
billion in capital spending set last year.
   This year would mark the fourth consecutive increase in
investment. However, the rate of growth would be the slowest in
three years. Capital spending rose 8.6 percent in 1989, 8.9 percent
in 1988 and 4.2 percent in 1987.
   The new estimate for capital spending growth in 1990 is only
slightly below last year's rise and represents a substantial
increase from an earlier survey of 1990 plans released in December.
At that time, businesses said they planned to boost spending by
only 4.9 percent.
   All of the figures have been adjusted for inflation.
   The earlier survey occurred when many economists were predicting
a recession this year. Since then, the economy has proved more
resilient than expected and as a consequence companies have planned
for expansion more optimistically.
   The projected increase in spending would be good news for the
economy, providing needed momentum this year at a time when the
stimulus from a shrinking trade deficit is fading.
   Economists say the increased productivity that results from
investment spending is the only way in the long run to bolster
economic growth. The Federal Reserve Board has been keeping
interest rates relatively high in an attempt to keep the economy
from overheating and fueling inflation.
   The 7.6 percent investment increase for all industries includes
a 4.6 percent rise in manufacturing and a 9.5 percent increase for
companies engaged in mining, transportation and other
non-manufacturing areas.
   Manufacturing and housing have been the sectors of the economy
hardest hit by the Fed's tight money policy.
   Manufacturers are projecting investment spending this year of
$190.2 billion. The anticipated rate of increase, although lower
than the average for all industries, was still sharply up from the
1.4 percent projection in December.
   The manufacturing gain includes a 2.2 percent rise in durable
goods and a 6.6 percent increase for non-durables. Durable goods
are ``big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years _
everything from washing machines to warships. Because buyers
usually borrow to buy durable goods, their sales are more sharply
depressed by high interest rates.
   In the December survey, durable goods manufacturers had
projected a 1.5 percent drop in investment spending.

   J. Kenneth Robinson, a Virginia
Republican who served seven terms in the U.S. House of
Representatives, has died of complications from pancreatic cancer.
He was 73.
   Robinson died Sunday at his Frederick County home, said his
former administrative assistant, Chris Mathisen.
   Robinson represented the state's 7th District, in northern
Virginia, from 1970 until in 1985, when he said he was retiring
from politics because he was frustrated wiith being in the minority.
   During his tenure, Robinson earned a reputation as a fiscal
conservative who pushed for a strong defense. He concentrated on
budgetary matters in the agricultural, defense and intelligence
fields.
   Robinson was born May 14, 1916, in Frederick County. He received
a bachelor of science degree in horticulture from Virginia Tech in
1937 and then entered the family orchard business. He served as an
Army major during World War II.
   In 1965, Robinson assumed the state Senate seat held by Harry F.
Byrd Jr., who was appointed to the U.S. Senate to replace Byrd's
father. Robinson held the seat until he was elected to Congress.

   The ultimate Easter egg was unveiled Wednesday in
London, but it's not for eating or painting on Easter Sunday.
   The egg, valued at $11.5 million, is made from 33 pounds of gold
and nearly 20,000 pink diamonds.
   It is called the Argyle Library Egg and was commissioned by
Argyle Diamonds of Perth, Australia, which markets precious gems.
   The 15-inch-hih egg opens electronically to reveal a revolving
stand of miniature books and portraits in jeweled cabinets. It sits
on a gold and diamond stand nearly as high as the egg itself.
   ``We don't know who might be likely to buy it,'' said the egg's
designer, Paul Kutchinsky, who runs a jewelry design business in
London.
   His team of craftsmen labored more than 7,000 hours over two
years to make the egg. Its design was inspired by the Easter egg
gifts of the Faberge jewelry-makers for the Russian imperial family
before the 1917 revolution.
   The Argyle egg will be displayed at a watch and jewelry fair in
Basel, Switzerland, April 19-26, and in London's Victoria and
Albert Museum until May 6. After that it will be shown in Tokyo and
New York.

   A cargo ship crashed into the side of an oil tanker

an official at the Maritime Safety Agency said.
   The freighter Sumiryu Maru went out of control and smashed into

   No injuries were reported, but the impact ripped a hole in the
tanker and created the oil spill, according to the official, who

   The 121-ton tanker was fueling a ferry boat when it was hit by
the 499-ton freighter, he said.
   The agency was questioning the Sumiryu Maru's captain about the
cause of accident, he said.

   Elton John handed tissues to tearful
mourners at a viewing ceremony for Ryan White, who inspired
compassion for AIDS sufferers while losing a 5{-year battle to the
disease.
   White was to be buried today at a ceremony that Barbara Bush,
Gov. Evan Bayh, pop star Michael Jackson and others promised to
attend. The first lady flew to Indianapolis along with White House
physician Burton Lee, who is a former member of the president's
National Commission on AIDS.
   About 300 people were waiting outside the church this morning
before visitation began.
   ``To me he was inspiration to all young people, his fight for
life and everthing else he went through,'' said Gladys Lewis, who
was among the mourners. ``I'm glad to see that he was so thought of
that so many are here. It shows that somehow we all learned
something from his battle.''
   The eulogy was to be read by the Rev. Raymond ``Bud'' Probasco,
chosen by the 18-year-old White in his dying days. Probasco grew
close to the youth while serving at St. Luke's United Methodist
Church in Kokomo.
   White, who won a court battle to attend public school near
Kokomo and later became a spokesman for sufferers of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, died Sunday of lung congestion from an
AIDS-related respiratory infection. He contracted AIDS in 1984 from
blood products used to treat his hemophilia.
   Between 1,000 and 1,500 people filed past White's casket at the
funeral home in Carmel, an Indianapolis suburb, Tuesday afternoon
and evening.
   Jackson was among family and close friends who paid last
respects earlier before the home was opened to the general public,
said Brian Buchanan, vice president of Flanner &amp; Buchanan
Mortuaries.
   White's body was outfited with a red pullover shirt and a faded
jean jacket, and his eyes were covered with sunglasses. A
photograph of a baby rested in the knotty pine casket with him.
   The viewing area, set up by White's mother, Jeanne White,
featured floral arrangements, a painted portrait, magazine covers
that told his story and photographs of White with celebrities,
including Lukas Haas, who portrayed him in a made-for-TV movie,
actress Loni Anderson and Indiana University basketball coach Bob
Knight.
   Pop singer John, who had comforted the family during the youth's
final days in the hospital, accompanied Mrs. White to the funeral
parlor and handed out tissues to mourners.
   The callers included Dr. Martin Kleiman, an infectious disease
specialist who treated Ryan after he contracted AIDS in 1984.
   In today's edition of The Washington Post, former President
Ronald Reagan wrote a column, saying White ``was patient and kind
and did not wallow in self-pity.''
   ``We owe it to Ryan to open our hearts and our minds to those
with AIDS,'' Reagan wrote. ``We owe it to Ryan to be compassionate,
caring and tolerant toward those with AIDS, their families and
friends. It's the disease that's frightening, not the people who
have it.''

<TEXT>
   A former circus performer who
prosecutors said can swallow and regurgitate sharp objects at will
was convicted of slashing a jail guard. The blade was never found.
   Benjamin Carnesoltas, 36, was convicted Tuesday of assault for
cutting the neck of Municipal Corrections Institution officer John
Wickizer on Oct. 29. The injury required about nine stitches.
   The defense said reasonable doubt existed because no one found
the razor blade.
   ``He swallows razor blades and brings them back,'' Assistant
prosecutor Jim Humphrey told Jackson County Circuit Court jurors.
``I wouldn't be surprised if he had one now.''
   Jail records indicated that guards had seen Carnesoltas move his
throat and produce parts of razor blades or sharp metal on about
five occasions.
   Carnesoltas, who came to the United States in the 1980 Mariel
boat lift from Cuba, testified he could not swallow sharp objects.
He said he was a circus trapeze performer in Cuba, not a knife
artist.
   Prosecutors said he either was a sword swallower or learned that
talent while working in the circus.
   Carnesoltas had been out of a Missouri prison for nine days
after being paroled on a burglary charge when he attacked Wickizer
at the jail, authorities said. He had been sent there to complete a
term for a 1987 assault conviction and escape charge.
   Carnesoltas faces a possible sentence of one to 10 years. Judge
John R. O'Malley set sentencing for May 11.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on General Motors' Robert
Stempel:
   Let's hope that what's good for General Motors' Robert Stempel
will be good for the country. ...
   Stempel has just been chosen as the new chairman and chief
executive of GM, the largest U.S. corporation. His selection may
suggest something of a change in the attitudes of American big
business. ... Stempel, currently the company's president, is an
engineer _ and, to use automobile industry jargon, a ``product
guy.''
   Most previous leaders of the giant company, including the
departing Roger Smith, have come from the financial side. ...
(Stempel's appointment) may suggest that American business is
giving new emphasis to engineering and product development, and
less to financial ``redeployments'' and other maneuverings. Such a
change would be healthy.
   Further, the selection of a man with ... Stempel's substantial
foreign experience may indicate a heightened corporate appreciation
of the need to succeed in the world marketplace _ where the great
growth of the future is likely to come.
   The appointment of Robert Stempel to lead General Motors may
suggest that American industry is now giving more attention to
these essential elements of corporate _ and national _ success.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on South Africa:
   After decades of injustice, there are signs that South Africa's
racist system of apartheid might crumble. But recent advances have
stalled.
   The United States should increase the pressure on South Africa
to help keep progress coming.
   Tougher U.S. sanctions would give South Africa's black leaders a
stronger bargaining chip in upcoming talks with the white
government.
   Tougher sanctions also would give South African President F.W.
de Klerk the opportunity, if he chooses, to blame the United States
for the need for more changes.
   U.S. sanctions have helped prod South Africa slowly toward a
just society. It's time to step up the pace.

   Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record on immigration reform and
discrimination:
   Comprehensive immigration reform was designed to curtail illegal
immigration. It is not a license to discriminate against
Mexican-Americans or legal aliens or Americans who look or sound
foreign.
   Apparently, however, discrimination has been the unintended
result. According to a recent report by the General Accounting
Office, the Immigration Reform and Control Act has indeed produced
a ``widespread pattern of discrimination.'' Some are having trouble
finding work because employers fear the consequences of the law.
   Congress now must respond. Under the 1986 law, a finding of
``widespread'' discrimination requires lawmakers to reconsider
employer sanctions within the next 30 days. Repealing sanctions is
an option, although less extreme options are available _ and at
this point preferable.
   Illegal immigration continues to be a problem, particularly
along the U.S.-Mexico border area; immigration reform was a
good-faith effort to respond. Now that effort needs to be
calibrated. The law cannot be an excuse to discriminate.

   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on Mississippi delta problems:
   The final report of the Mississippi Delta Development Commission
is due next month. The findings of the commission are being awaited
with interest.
   Congress allocated $3 million to study economic conditions in
impoverished regions of seven states bordering the Mississippi
River _ Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky,
Missouri and Illinois. The study is to be concluded with a 10-year
plan for economic development.
   Even as the report is being finalized, preliminary information
is circulating. Among those recently submitting data were
sociologists Forrest A. Deseran and Joachim Singlemann of Louisiana
State University. Their principal conclusion was that the Delta
region ``stands apart from the mainstream'' and ``if it is to
become competitive in the national economy'' it needs help now.
   To facilitate their study the researchers divided the 214-county
area into 27 labor markets. They found that the top third of the
labor markets compared favorably to national averages. Unemployment
rates and poverty evident in the bottom two-thirds, however, ``show
the extent of the task at hand.''
   In those 18 labor markets, the average unemployment rate is 36
percent higher than the national average, their per capita income
is less than 75 percent of the U.S. total, and their families are
more than twice as likely to be poor as the average American.

I've seen in the year I've been here. Everything went perfect.''
   Worsdale said the rocket flew south over the Pacific Ocean, and
the satellites, weighing from 120 to 150 pounds each, went into
orbit at 8:15 a.m.
   The three satellites, containing four experiments, were
propelled toward a 460-mile polar orbit by the Atlas, which was
topped by a Scout-Altair upper stage booster.
   The mission was named P87-2 Stacksat. The Air Force hasn't
explained the meaning of P87-2, but Stacksat means the satellites
were stacked atop the rocket for launch.
   The Atlas, similar to the one that lifted John Glenn to the
first manned orbit of Earth in 1962, was built by General Dynamics
and once served as a nuclear warhead-tipped intercontinental
ballistic missile at Forbes Air Force Base in Kansas. It was
refurbished in 1987 for use in launching payloads into space.
   The instruments on the three research satellites will help make
navigation charts and test ways to overcome phenomena in Earth's
atmosphere that can interfere with military and other
communications.
   The devices will be turned on in about 30 days and operate for
at least a year, Capt. Mark Goodman, project manager, said in a
statement issued before the launch.
   The uppermost satellite, named Polar Orbiting Geomagnetic
Survey, contains two experiments. The first is a magnetometer that
will measure the strength of the Earth's magnetic field at various
locations. The data will be used to help construct new Defense
Mapping Agency geomagnetic charts, which are updated every five
years as the magnetic field changes.
   The satellite also contains the Solid State Recorder experiment,
meant to demonstrate the use of high-speed integrated circuit
designs as computer memory devices in space, said Ed Parsons, chief
spokesman for the Air Force's Space Systems Division in Los Angeles.
   The second satellite, named TEX, or Transceiver Experiment, will
study communications problems by bouncing radio waves off the
ionosphere, the part of Earth's atmosphere rich with electrically
charged particles.
   The third satellite, the Selective Communications Experiment,
carries a variable-power radio transmitter that will also bounce
radio waves of varying frequencies off the ionosphere for similar
studies.

<HEAD>Woman Recalls the Day John Dillinger Held Her Hostage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOWLING GREEN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was more than half a century ago,
but Ruth Harris Davidson still remembers the day she held hands
with bank robber John Dillinger.
   The desperado and an accomplice had just robbed the National
Bank of Fostoria of $17,000, shot seven people, and was speeding
out of town with Mrs. Davidson balanced precariously on the running
board of the careening getaway car.
   The robbery occurred May 3, 1934, during one of Dillinger's
Midwestern crime sprees. Since then Mrs. Davidson, then a teller at
the bank, has lived what she terms ``a quiet life.'' But events of
that day still bring a sparkle to her eyes.
   She chuckled on learning recently that the Warner Bros. movie
studio is scouting northwest Ohio for a place to film a movie about
Dillinger. She lives in Bowling Green, about 20 miles northwest of
Fostoria.
   Mrs. Davidson, 78, recalled her suprise at the suddenness of the
holdup by Dillinger and Homer Van Meter, and the whirlwind pace of
her kidnapping.
   ``They came in and both were wearing long coats,'' she said.
``One of them _ I can't remember which _ shouted, `Everybody out of
the cages.' ... I thought it was a joke until they brought out the
machine guns from under the coats.''
   Employees were lined up across the glass entrance to shield the
holdup men from police gunfire from outside. Dillinger ordered bank
president Andrew Emerine to open the vault.
   ``When he took a little too long to get the keys, Van Meter
shredded the glass partition between the cages and vault with his
machine gun and they went in,'' Mrs. Davidson said. ``Then they
came out and cleaned the money out of the tellers' cages. I can
remember just standing there shivering.''
   When the bandits fled, Mrs. Davidson said, ``Van Meter grabbed
me and held me in front of him.'' They also took another employee
as a hostage.
   ``I can only remember saying, `I'll do anything, I just want to
go home to my mother.'''
   They made the hostages stand on the running boards of the car to
keep police from shooting as they sped away.
   `We thought we were going to fall off or the car would tip over.
We had to scoot down against the wind, and Dillinger held onto my
hand the whole time,'' Mrs. Davidson said.
   Two miles out of town, the bandits slowed down, thanked their
hostages politely, and told them to jump. They then drove away.
   ``It was a long time before I wasn't afraid of something
happening,'' she said. ``I didn't follow Dillinger's career after
that. ... But I still feel that man's arm around me once in a
while.''
   Dillinger was killed by police in Chicago two months later.

<HEAD>Businesses Revise Capital Spending Plans Upward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's businesses, shrugging off
economists' gloomy recession predictions, have significantly
increased their plans for modernization and expansion this year,
the government said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said a survey completed in March found
businesses planning a record $503.4 billion in plant and equipment
spending in 1990, up 7.6 percent from last year.
   Businesses had projected a much less optimistic 4.9 percent rise
in an earlier survey released in December, when many analysts were
forecasting the imminent end of the economy's seven-year expansion.
   ``The significance of this is it's one more piece of evidence
we're not going into a recession,'' said economist Gordon Richards
of the National Association of Manufacturers. ``Capital spending
... (will be) providing some strength to an otherwise weak
economy.''
   If the new projections are realized, spending would surpass the
previous record of $467.8 billion set last year and would mark the
fourth consecutive increase. Capital spending rose 8.6 percent in
1989, 8.9 percent in 1988 and 4.2 percent in 1987.
   All the figures have been adjusted for inflation.
   The surprisingly strong investment plans come at a time of
generally sluggish economic growth and declining corporate profits.
Most analysts are forecasting growth, as measured by the gross
national product, of around 2 percent this year, down from 3
percent last year.
   The survey indicates businesses appear to be looking beyond the
slowdown and are making the improvements they need to ensure
increased productivity and better profits in the future, economists
said.
   ``Despite all the stories of gloom and doom you read, ... this
shows that businesses are not ... as shortsighted as many say,''
said economist Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   Over time, capital spending not only will bolster economic
growth, it will increase profits and ease inflation, he said.
   The current profit squeeze is being caused by companies'
inability to pass on higher costs to their customers. Modernization
spending should help eliminate the production bottlenecks that are
driving up those costs, he said.
   The report should be received as good news at the Federal
Reserve, which has been using relatively high interest rates to
dampen economic growth and prevent demand from swapping production
capacity and adding to inflation pressures.
   ``The Fed's wish list is probably not so much an economic
slowdown, but a shift from consumer spending to savings and
investment,'' Roach said.
   Economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch said capital spending
plans are weakest in businesses most affected by lackluster
domestic demand for ``big ticket'' durable goods, such as autos,
and strongest in sectors supported by strong overseas demand, such
as paper, aircraft and non-electrical machinery.
   The 7.6 percent planned investment increase for all industries
includes a 4.6 percent rise in manufacturing and a 9.5 percent
increase for companies engaged in mining, transportation and other
non-manufacturing areas.
   Manufacturers are projecting investment spending this year of
$190.2 billion. The anticipated rate of increase, although lower
than the average for all industries, was still sharply up from the
1.4 percent projection in December.
   The manufacturing gain includes a 2.2 percent rise in durable
goods and a 6.6 percent increase for non-durables. Durable goods
are items expected to last three or more years _ everything from
washing machines to warships. Because buyers usually borrow to
purchase durable goods, those sales are more easily depressed by
high interest rates.
   In the December survey, durable-goods manufacturers had
projected a 1.5 percent drop in investment spending.
   Before adjusting for inflation, the department predicted a 7.8
percent increase for all businesses this year to $512.8 billion
after rising 10.4 percent last year. That was up from the earlier
1990 forecast of 6.4 percent.

<TEXT>
   The Angolan government has agreed to
start direct peace talks with Jonas Savimbi's U.S.-backed rebels
this month in Portugal, the Angolan state news agency ANGOP
reported today.
   In a dispatch released in Lisbon, the agency quoted Angolan
Deputy Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura as saying:
   ``Probably this month (and) next month, representatives of the
Angolan government and elements of UNITA will meet to discuss the
internal problem.''
   The Soviet-backed Marxist government has been fighting the
rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
or UNITA, since shortly after the southern African nation gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   ANGOP quoted unidentified sources in Luanda as saying initial
direct contacts would be held in Portugal, probably on April 16,
with more talks following in the West African island nation of Cape
Verde.
   The site of the talks ``cannot be an obstacle, because peace can
be negotiated in any part of the world if the (negotiators) are
interested in a determined objective,'' de Moura said.
   The report said de Moura made his comments in an interview with
journalists of the British Broadcasting Corp. in Luanda.
   A UNITA spokesman in Lisbon, Norberto de Castro, said he had
received no official confirmation of the report, but welcomed the
Angolan government's readiness to talk. The government is ruled by
the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).
   ``This is a sign the MPLA understands the situation. ... for us,
any date will do,'' de Castro told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview.
   The announcement follows the rebels' offer on Monday of an
immediate cease-fire. Fighting has intensified in recent months,
and the rebels have stepped up urban bomb and sabotage attacks in
the capital, Luanda.

   Leaders of Baltic-American groups urged
President Bush today to take steps toward recognizing Lithuania's
declaration of independence from the Soviet Union, but were unable
to persuade him to take that step.
   ``Our policy, we believe, is the correct one and it does not
involve recognition,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said afterwards.
   ``The president did not change his views but was impressed with
the strength and depth of their convictions,'' Fitzwater said.
   Emerging from the meeting, Anthony Mazeika of the Baltic
American Freedom League said, ``We are disappointed with the
official policy of the United States by not extending recognition''
to President Vytautas Landsbergis' government.
   Even so, the Baltic-American leaders said they were pleased to
have had an audience with Bush as last, after being turned down for
meetings earlier.
   ``We have a lot of very good contacts on the lower- and
mid-levels of the State Department. It's just the White House we
haven't been able to penetrate. We used to wear out the threshold
of the previous administration,'' said Mari-Ann Rikken, chairman of
the Joint Baltic American National Committee.
   Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III spent more than
an hour with Americans representing the interests of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia, the three Baltic states annexed by the Soviet
Union in 1940.
   Mazeika said they pressed Bush and Baker to grant de facto
recognition of the Landsbergis' government as an intermediate step
toward full diplomatic ties.
   Asked if Bush left the impression he was sympathetic to that
idea, Ms. Rikken said, ``No, we don't have that feel. But te fact
that he met with us, the fact that I think we made an impression,
that this is not some sort of an emotional appeal ... I think that
had an impact.''
   Mazeika said that Bush expressed sympathy for their cause but
said he ``has to consider the other agendas as well as his feeling
that there must be a way to support (Soviet President Mikhail S.)
Gorbachev's overall efforts for democratic reform.''
   Bush said Tuesday that Gorbachev's tolerance of democratic
freedoms in Warsaw Pact nations had demonstrated ``a commitment to
reform and openness that's remarkable.''
   ``So give him credit and deal openly'' with him on problems such
as Lithuania, the president said. ``But when you have difficulties
like we have today, talk frankly with him about it.''
   Bush's twin-edged message of praise and restraint appeared
intended to put pressure on Gorbachev not to use force or
additional intimidation against Lithuania to abandon its
declaration of independence.
   Bush, on a visit to Toronto, said no one could have predicted
Gorbachev's willingness to accept changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``In other words, he has demonstrated that he is committed to
peaceful change and the evolution of democracy,'' he said.
   Mulroney was the first of three Western leaders holding talks
with Bush over a 10-day period. Bush will see British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher in Bermuda on Friday and confer with
French President Francois Mitterrand in Key Largo, Fla., on April
19.
   The chief topics of Bush's talks with Mulroney were the tensions
in Lithuania and the president's five-day summit with Gorbachev
beginning May 30.
   Bush said that if the situation in Lithuania deteriorates, ``it
would be extraordinarily difficult to move forward as rapidly as
I'd like to see us move forward with them on a lot of questions.''
   He said the presence of Soviet tanks in Lithuania make it ``even
more important to have good-faith negotiations'' over the fate of
the republic.
   ``I would just appeal to all sides and anyone with any influence
to encourage dialogue and discussion,'' he said.

<HEAD>Irish Leader Urges Economic Unity With British Province</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM BRODIE</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey brought a message of economic unity to Northern Ireland on
Wednesday, but Protestant demonstrators shouted support for the
island's political division.
   ``Haughey, Haughey, out, out, out!,'' demonstrators cried.
   Haughey, chairman of the European Community's Council of
Ministers, told a conference on cross-border trade that ``economic
forces will inevitably interlink the economies of both parts of
Ireland.''
   ``As the technical and fiscal borders disappear, and both
economies will converge, it will make simple common sense for us to
combine in facing the problems and opportunities that the situation
will present equally to us both,'' Haughey said. ``These are the
economic realities of the future.''
   The overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland has been
separated from Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland since 1922,
when Ireland gained independence from Britain. Ireland's
constitution lays claim to the whole island, and Northern Ireland
has been torn by conflict between advocates of Irish unity and
those loyal to Britain.
   Reg Empey, the lord mayor of Belfast and a Protestant, spoke to
the conference before Haughey and denounced Ireland's claim on the
province.
   About 300 Protestants gathered outside the Europa Hotel before
Haughey's speech. They were kept under control by a large security
operation mounted by the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern
Ireland's police force.
   ``Haughey is here to dance on the graves of the province's
bereaved,'' the Rev. Ian Paisley told reporters outside the hotel.
   Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, referred to
the slaying of four members of the Ulster Defense Regiment. They
were killed Monday by an Irish Republican Army bomb. Ireland's
foreign minister, Gerry Collins, earlier this year had called for
the heavily Protestant unit to be disbanded.
   Haughey repeatedly stressed the two parts of Ireland should
cooperate within the 12-nation European Community. Haughey
currently speaks on behalf of the bloc; its presidency rotates
every six months.
   ``Our economic and social characteristics, which are shared by
both parts of Ireland, would benefit if a combined approach could
be established,'' Haughey told the conference, which was organized
by the Institute of Directors.
   ``We have a clear mutual interest in strengthening community
policies for the less developed regions. It makes sense for both
parts of the island to cooperate and share the costs in developing
strategy.''
   Earlier, as he was ushered quickly past the demonstrators into
the hotel, Haughey was asked whether he worried about his personal
security while in Belfast.
   ``Not particularly,'' he said. ``I know the RUC (Royal Ulster
Constabulary) will make every effort to look after me.''
   A front-page cartoon in The Irish Times of Dublin on Wednesday
taunted Haughey for his past criticism of British rule in Northern
Ireland. The cartoon showed Haughey surrounded by RUC men with the
prime minister saying: ``Still a police state!! Thank goodness.''
   Irish leaders have rarely visited Northern Ireland since
sectarian and political fighting flared in 1969.
   Haughey's predecessor, Garret FitzGerald, was in the province in
November 1985 to sign the Anglo-Irish Agreement with Mrs. Thatcher.
The accord, deeply disliked by Protestants, gives Dublin a formal
consultative role in Northern Ireland's affairs and pledges the two
governments to cooperate against terrorism.

<HEAD>It Doesn't Hurt to Laugh, Says This Doctor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don't laugh now _ unless you're feeling achy _
but the town doctor of Motala, Sweden, says his research among the
dour folks of his community shows that humor can relieve pain.
   ``There was a linear relationship between the degree of fun and
the level of symptoms,'' Dr. Lars Ljungdahl, medical director of
the Motala Primary Health-Care Center, told a news conference
Wednesday, reporting on his ``laugh therapy'' research.
   Ljungdahl, 40, a fan of Peter Sellers and ``The Cosby Show,'' is
in the United States for a conference on humor and to consult with
medical researchers to bolster his theory that laughter suppresses
the hormones that cause stress and thus helps people with chronic
pain.
   He described his research with six Motala women suffering from
muscular-skeletal disorders and depressive moods.
   The patients met at his clinic weekly for 13 weeks, used funny
books, records and videos. Ljungdahl reported in a letter to the
Journal of the American Medical Association that the women
``learned to give higher priority to humor in our everyday lives.''
   For homework, they kept notebooks of funny things observed,
ranking them on a one-to-five scale _ from hardly a grin to
``laughed heartily.''
   The result: The pain didn't vanish, but the patients' quality of
life improved.
   They still meet occasionally, to joke around.
   ``We felt better ourselves for having met with this group,'' the
doctor said. ``I think I have become a little funnier myself. You
tell your patients that you are the doctor treating patients with
humor and they begin to laugh immediately.''
   Ljungdahl said his findings complement those of Norman Cousins,
author of two best-selling books on how one's outlook can affect
recovery from life-threatening illnesses.
   ``The humor perspective is a way of thinking,'' Ljungdahl said,
``a way of getting distance from your problems.''
   He said he isn't ready to claim that humor actually cures
disease, but ``there are indications pointing in that direction. We
know that laughter enhances the immune system.''
   He rejects smutty or ethnic jokes in his therapy. Jokes are
fine, he says, but the humorous events of everyday life are better
medicine.
   Pressed for an example, he told of a friend delivering a speech
in Poland.
   The friend wanted to open by saying ``ladies and gentlemen'' in
Polish, but forgot those words. So he noted what appeared on the
doors of the men's and ladies' restrooms. When he spoke, the
audience roared.
   The speaker had said, ``Ladies and urinals.''
   ``Every person has a sense of humor,'' Ljungdahl said. ``Every
child laughs. It is not so much learning something new but
regaining what you once had.''
   If the people of Motala can respond to laugh therapy, he said,
people anywhere can. Motala people have a reputation for
complaining, he said.
   ``It is,'' he said, with a thin smile, ``Sweden's whine
district.''

   T-shirts or teddy bears inscribed with the
message of a political or religious group have the same
constitutional protection as books, a federal appeals court ruled.
   In a 3-0 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
San Francisco can't prohibit non-profit groups from selling items
that convey ``core First Amendment messages,'' such as political or
philosophical statements.
   The city also can't require those groups to get a permit, issued
at the sole discretion of the police chief, to sell message-bearing
merchandise, the court said Tuesday. The decision, the first on the
issue by any federal appeals court, upholds a 1988 lower-court
ruling.
   ``It's nice that the First Amendment still seems to survive,''
said Robert Moest, lawyer for five religious and political groups
that challenged the San Francisco ordinance. He said the items
served an important political function.
   ``Since the Vietnam War, people have tended to wear T-shirts
conveying their beliefs,'' Moest said. ``Organizations sell them to
raise funds for their cause. It's a great way to communicate a
message.''
   The city will appeal the ruling, said Deputy City Attorney Burk
Delventhal.
   ``We have a longstanding policy of the city that sidewalks shall
not be used by merchants in competition with businesses ... who
rent space and pay taxes.'' The non-profit vendors, he said, ``are
masquerading under the guise of the First Amendment.''
   Delventhal also said the appeals court's standard _ protecting
sales of items that were ``inextricably intertwined'' with a
political or other non-commercial message _ was vague and
unworkable. How would it apply, he asked, to the common practice of
selling a T-shirt showing a San Francisco scene with the name of a
religious group in fine print?
   The ordinance, which originally applied only to the Fisherman's
Wharf and Union Square tourist areas and was later made citywide,
was backed by shop owners who complained that their prices were
being undercut by non-profit street vendors.
   The ordinance required non-profit organizations to get a
peddler's permit to sell any merchandise except books, leaflets and
other items that had no value apart from the message they carried.
   The lawsuit said the ordinance would muzzle free expression by
stopping the sale of goods that had value but also carried a
message, such as T-shirts, stuffed animals or jewelry carrying
inscriptions. The suit was filed in 1986 by the Gaudiya Vishnava
Society, a religious group, and joined later by four groups
representing environmental, anti-war and gay-rights causes.
   U.S. District Judge William Schwarzer prohibited enforcement of
the ordinance against sales of message-bearing items. His decision
was affirmed by the appeals court.
   ``The non-profit groups inform individuals of their causes
through distributing their literature, engaging in persuasive
speech, and selling merchandise with messages affixed to the
product,'' said the opinion by Judge Melvin Brunetti. Joining him
were judges John Noonan and Harry Hupp.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze has expressed interest in dual NATO-Warsaw Pact
membership for a united Germany, according to an article to be
published next month.
   Shevardnadze also said he foresaw a security arrangement between
Europe, the Soviet Union and North Ameria that eventually would
replace both military alliances.
   ``Many of our experts ... believe that the idea of `dual
membership' for Germany could provide a pragmatic way out of the
difficulties emerging now,'' Shevardnadze wrote in a piece for the
May issue of ``NATO's Sixteen Nations.'' It is an independent
magazine covering international security issues.
   ``I would favor a serious and thorough analysis of this
option,'' he said.
   Last week in Washington, U.S. officials said the Soviet Union
dropped its demand that a unified Germany be militarily neutral. It
continued to oppose membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   West Germany is a NATO member. East Germany is in the
Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact.
   The Soviet foreign minister wrote that dual membership proposal
``would help overcome further the division of Europe, contribute to
its unification and create integrated spaces in it.'' The article
was made available Wednesday to The Associated Press.
   Reacting to the article, NATO spokesman Florent Swijsen said the
16-nation Western alliance remains opposed to dual membership.
   ``The allies are not considering the possibility of a unified
Germany being part of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact,'' he said in a
statement. ``Even several members of the latter (Warsaw Pact) have
indicated their preference for a united Germany as a member of
NATO.''
   NATO officials have said that after unification, Soviet troops
could be temporarily stationed in what is now East Germany.
   Shevardnadze said in his article that the Kremlin believed
``Germany should become a military non-aligned state and a
demilitarized state in the sense that it ought to possess the
lowest possible military capability sufficient for defense.''
   ``At the same time, we hold that in the final analysis Germany
should be a fully equal member of today's family of nations and
become a state like all other states,'' he wrote.
   He suggested the new state ``declare that it will not have
nuclear, chemical or other weapons of mass destruction.''
   The Soviet official outlined his view of how a ``Greater
Europe'' security structure should look, based on the 35-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The 35 nations _
the United States, Canada and all in Europe except Albania _ will
hold a summit later this year.
   He suggested the organization hold summit meetings of national
leaders every two years, with foreign ministers gathering yearly as
the top political body.
   ``Europe is heading for a new status in terms of its instruments
of security,'' Shevardnadze wrote. ``If and when the blocs vanish
into thin air _ and the process must not be artificially boosted _
no vacuum should be allowed to form.''

<HEAD>Invention Plays With Time ... for the World Traveler</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the world traveler, or for those who just
never have enough time, comes a new invention: a watch designed to
fool the wearer into thinking he's always at the right time, even
between time zones at 600 mph.
   And with hands that can be speeded up or slowed down, the watch
does have its other uses, its inventor says. Time can fly during a
dull party, or crawl for a fun date.
   ``The thing to avoid is having a very boring conversation on a
westbound trip, because your watch is already running slower, and
if the person next to you is boring the pants off you, you're in
trouble,'' said Ross Mitchell, a 38-year-old computer systems
consultant who recently patented the watch.
   On the other hand, Mitchell said, ``if you're going eastbound,
you can tolerate someone who's not holding your interest, because
time is running faster.''
   Mitchell says he created the watch to aid travelers with the
psychological elements of jet lag, by helping the mind adjust to
living hours ahead or behind what it's used to.
   ``It provides the traveler with a seamless means of traveling
around the world, so you would not have any problem with
experiencing local time as real time for you,'' said Mitchell, a
novice inventor.
   In the meantime, the watch raises some cosmic questions.
   ``Part of reality is what you believe,'' said Dr. Martin
Moore-Ede, director of the Institute for Circadian Physiology and
an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. ``I think what
Ross has got is one very interesting part of the whole puzzle. It's
one of the tools, not the panacea, but one of the tools that may
help in adjusting to time zones.''
   With a regular watch, a traveler who boards a plane at 8 a.m. in
Boston would travel six hours to get to Los Angeles, where his
watch would read 2 p.m., until he set it back three hours to match
local time.
   The traveler who wears the Acclimator watch, however, punches in
the time at a destination and the hours to be spent in flight.
   Then, on a westbound flight, the hands would move half as fast
as real time, reverting to normal time-keeping upon arrival. For
eastbound travelers, the watch would go 50 percent faster than
normal time.
   But what happens if a fellow plane traveler asks what time it is?
   ``The time on your watch is really what time it is for you,''
Mitchell said.
   The watch still might not be the best idea for everybody,
Mitchell admits.
   ``It's definitely not recommended for pilots in flight, because
if time were moving at an abnormal rate, they and the air traffic
controllers would have difficulty agreeing on what time it was,''
Mitchell said.
   Also, ``people who are taking medicine ... we're going to have
to have a disclaimer,'' Mitchell said. ``I could see people suing
that they're taking the pill every hour instead every two hours
because their watches are ahead.''
   Mitchell, who lives in suburban Newton, dreamed up the
Acclimator during his numerous business trips.
   ``For years I would set my watch for the destination as soon as
I got on the plane, which most people do. Then I had the idea to
increment my watch one hour at a time to try to smooth it out. Then
I thought `Well, gee, there would be a way to get the watch to do
it more smoothly','' Mitchell said.
   ``Thousands of man hours'' and about $10,000 in legal fees
later, Mitchell received the patent for his watch in February. He
is currently negotiating with several manufacturers, and hopes to
offer the technology on a high-priced face watch by next Christmas.
   Ultimately, Mitchell said, he plans to take the watch abroad. He
has applied for patents in Japan, Europe and Canada.
   It's the Soviet Union, however, where Mitchell could find his
windfall. The largest country in the world, the U.S.S.R. has no
less than 11 time zones, he noted.

<HEAD>IRS Ahead Of Last Year's Pace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is ahead of last
year's pace in processing income tax returns.
   The agency said Wednesday that through April 6, it had processed
almost 57 million returns, or about 90 percent of the 66.3 million
it had received. At this time last year, the IRS had received 64.7
million returns and processed 82 percent, or 53.3 million.
   Almost 80 percent of the individuals and couples who have filed
are qualifying for refunds. Through last week, the IRS had
certified 45.3 million refunds totaling $38.6 billion, compared
with 42.1 million refunds worth $34.7 billion at this time a year
ago.
   The number of taxpayers filing by computer is almost quadruple
the 1.06 million recorded during the entire tax season last year.
The IRS has received 3.9 milion electronic returns so far this
year; it had forecast 2 million for the year.
   Electronic filing is available in all states this year, but only
to taxpayers who expect a refund. Electronic returns are filed via
computer through IRS-authorized transmissions companies, which
charge a fee for the service.
   The deadline for filing a return, either the electronic variety
or the old-fashioned paper kind, is midnight Monday. Residents of
New England and most parts of upstate New York, who send their
returns to Andover, Mass., get an extra day because Monday is a
legal holiday, Patriots Day, in Massachusetts.

   A tree planted by President Bush and later
damaged by vandals is making a comeback, but city park officials
say it is too early to tell if it will survive.
   The tree is generating buds, which is a good sign but does not
guarantee the sapling will recover, Parks Manager Taylor Bressler
said.
   A more likely indicator would be the emergence of shoots for new
branches, which should occur during the next few weeks, he said
Tuesday.
   The tree is an offshoot of an American elm planted on the White
House lawn in 1826 by President John Quincy Adams. Bush gave the
sapling to the city in September for the Washington state
centennial.
   Within 48 hours, vandals at Riverfront Park broke several of the
tree's limbs, and it was moved to see if it could be salvaged.
   No arrests have been made.

   Mother Teresa, the frail Roman Catholic
nun who won a Nobel Peace Prize for her work among the sick and
dying, said Wednesday she was stepping down as head of the
religious order she founded in 1950.
   ``I have been leading the Missionaries of Charity for 40
years,'' Mother Teresa said with a smile as she bustled about her
home and office near the Calcutta slum where she started her work.
   But the 79-year-old nun would not comment further on her
decision to step down as the order's superior general.
   In Italy, a Vatican spokesman said Pope John Paul II had
accepted Mother Teresa's resignation. Deputy Vatican spokesman
Monsignor Piero Pennacchini said Mother Teresa was retiring for
health reasons.
   In September, Mother Teresa suffered a heart attack and serious
infection and surgeons implanted a permanent pacemaker on Dec. 1.
   Since then, Mother Teresa has been unable to leave Calcutta to
visit missions in other parts of the world. She seldom leaves the
second floor of her home, which doubles as the order's headquarters.
   Since its founding, the Missionaries of Charity has spread to 87
countries and is staffed by 3,000 nuns.
   Asked who would head the organization, Mother Teresa raised her
hand toward the heavens.
   ``We will act the way He leads us,'' she said. A superior
general will be elected by the order in September, Pennacchini said.
   The next superior general of the order is likely to come from
the order's council of six nuns.
   Sister Agnes Das, a 60-year-old native of Calcutta and Mother
Teresa's first disciple, is next in command. But news reports say
Sister Agnes also is in ill-health.
   On Wednesday, a crowd of well-wishers came to Mother Teresa's
home, carrying flowers and donations of food for the nuns'
charities. Mother Teresa appeared healthy, her face graced with its
usual smile.
   Mother Teresa won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work
caring for people much of the world wanted to forget. Lepers,
cholera victims dying in their own excrement, abandoned children _
all found shelter in her clinics.
   She did her greatest work in Calcutta, the squalid metropolis on
India's eastern coast.
   ``She's just a living saint, that's all that anybody's ever
referred to her, she's a living saint of the gutters,'' Vi Collins,
member of the International Board for Co-Workers of Mother Theresa,
said in an interview Wednesday from Washington, D.C. Ms. Collins
has known Mother Teresa for 35 years and first met her in Calcutta.

   President F.W. de Klerk met
Wednesday with with Desmond Tutu and other church leaders to
discuss how to end black feuds in Natal province that have killed
about 400 people in the past two months.
   In the latest violence in South Africa's black townships, 12
more people were reported killed and 200 injured since Monday night.
   ``The situation in Natal has reached proportions which are
beyond human understanding and endurance,'' the South African
Council of Churches said in a separate statement.
   The church council, made up of most major Protestant
denominations, called ``on all people to use Holy Week ... through
Easter Sunday to focus on prayer and fasting for the people of
Natal in particular and South Africa as a whole.''
   There were no immediate details on de Klerk's meeting with
Archbishop Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, and other leaders of
the South African Council of Churches.
   Before the meeting, de Klerk said, ``I think the churches have a
role to play in ending the violence in the country.''
   The King Edward VIII Hospital in the port city of Durban said it
was so overcrowded due to the Natal fighting that it temporarily
stopped admitting patients in need of surgery, even emergency cases.
   ``We simply cannot carry out any more surgery,'' said the
hospital superintendent, Dr. A.M. Seedat. ``We have reached a
situation where we cannot take on a single extra patient.''
   Other hospitals in the area also are near capacity.
   Eight blacks were killed, including six by police fire, in
dozens of clashes in black townships across the country, police
said Wednesday in a report covering 56 incidents since Monday
night. Two hundred people were injured and dozens were arrested,
police said.
   Government-run radio reported four more people died in feuding
between black political factions in the Crossroads township outside
Cape Town.
   About 4,000 people have died in the Natal fighting since 1986.
   The main combatants are supporters of the African National
Congress, the country's leading anti-apartheid group, and Inkatha,
a relatively conservative Zulu organization. Both organizations
have large numbers of youthful supporters they cannot control.
   Criminal gangs and other bands have also taken advantage of the
chaos to loot, burn and murder.
   Hernus Kriel, the planning and provincial affairs minister,
toured the northern Natal battle zones Wednesday and announced a
$100,000 aid package for the estimated 13,000 Zulu refugees.
   He said the government's plan for dealing with the crisis would
be announced in the next week or two, but could take six or seven
years to carry out.
   ``The first thing that strikes me is the poverty of these
people,'' Kriel said. ``We will have to provide the infrastructure
for such basic needs as water, sewerage and rubbish removal.''
   The police commissioner, Gen. Johan van der Merwe, told
Parliament the secret to ending unrest was to send more security
forces into troubled areas.
   The minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok, said policemen were
resigning at the rate of 22 per day, double the rate of two months
ago. He proposed urgent increases in pay and benefits.

<TEXT>
   An international anti-drug summit of 112 nations
rejected the idea of legalizing narcotics and instead called
Wednesday for a wide range of actions to cut both supply and demand
of drugs.
   Earlier in the final day of the three-day conference, doctors
warned that the spread of AIDS by drug users was increasing
worldwide.
   While strongly rejecting legalization, the delegates disagreed
on punishment for drug abusers. However, they did back alternatives
to prison for offenders who want treatment.
   U.S. delegates said users must be held accountable, but
authorities from the Netherlands said drug abusers should be
treated like alcoholics or smokers.
   Delegates were also at odds over programs to make sterile
needles available to drug users to reduce the spread of AIDS
through contaminated needles.
   U.S. Secretary of Health Dr. Louis W. Sullivan questioned
research findings showing such programs did not promote increased
drug use. He said the U.S. government refused to fund such programs.
   The 35-point declaration adopted at the end of the drug
conference, sponsored by Britain and the United Nations, noted that
the drug market was no longer confined to industrial nations but
had spread to developing countries.
   The declaration called for action at the community, neighborhood
and family level, as well as the national and international level,
to prevent drug abuse. It said drug education should be started in
elementary school.
   The declaration committed delegates to giving higher priority to
fighting drugs on all fronts: reducing demand, eliminating crops
and drug trafficking, preventing laundering of drug money, and
promoting effective treatment and rehabilitation.
   U.S. and British experts told a final committee meeting
Wednesday that increased drug use in the developing world was
raising the number of drug abusers infected by HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS.
   ``Where three years ago, HIV infection among drug injectors was
seen as a developed world problem, it is now really seen as a
worldwide problem,'' said Dr. Don C. Des Jarlais of Beth Israel
Hospital in New York.
   Developing countries, particularly Thailand, Argentina and
Brazil, all reported HIV infection rates among drug injectors of 40
percent or more in the last three years, Des Jarlais said.
   ``And there is concern that other places where drug injection is
common, such as the Middle East, are subject to rapid epidemics of
the spread of HIV among drug users,'' he said.
   Dr. David Hawkins of St. Stephen's Clinic and Westminster
Hospital in London said that by the end of 1990, ``there are
projected to be more AIDS cases in injecting drug users than in
homosexual men'' in Europe.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a deadly
affliction in which a virus attacks the body's immune system. It is
spread mainly by sexual contact, the use of contaminated needles
among drug abusers, and transfusion of tainted blood.

<HEAD>France Rejects Criticism Stemming From Hostages' Release</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France rejected mounting criticism Wednesday that
it went too far in praising Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi for
helping free three hostages, and it denied paying a ransom of three
warplanes for their release.
   A newspaper reported that the Libyan navy was the real abductor
of the French and Belgians seized in November 1987 off the coast of
the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip. It said France bargained both with
Libya and a group led by terrorist Abu Nidal.
   The government insisted it did not bargain with terrorists. But
detractors made little distinction between Gadhafi and Abu Nidal's
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, a Palestinian terrorist group Gadhafi
has supported.
   Jacqueline Valente, her Belgian boyfriend Fernand Houtekins, and
their 2-year-old daughter Sophie-Liberte, born in captivity, were
freed Tuesday in Beirut. They flew to Paris on Tuesday night and
have remained out of public view at a military hospital. Abu
Nidal's group holds four other Belgians.
   The hostages were held in Lebanon, not Libya as widely believed,
Ms. Valente's brother-in-law, Andre Metral, said at a news
conference. He said the freed hostages had been treated well by
their captors.
   Also at the news conference was Jacques Verges, a lawyer who has
represented Ms. Valente's relatives. He urged the government to
release Palestinians held in France in terrorism-related cases,
saying they were viewed in Arab countries as hostages of France.
   Gadhafi on April 4 appealed for the release of hostages in the
Middle East, specifically mentioning Ms. Valente.
   Eighteen Western hostages are believed held in Lebanon,
including eight Americans. Irishman Brian Keenan, who taught
English at the American University of Beirut, marked his fourth
year as a hostage Wednesday with no word on his whereabouts. The
longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Most of the 18 are held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem factions
and are considered separate from the Abu Nidal captives.
   A leading Iranian newspaper Wednesday said all Western hostages
should be freed because keeping people captive contradicts Islamic
teachings.
   It was the third time in as many months the Tehran Times had
advocated the release of Western hostages.
   President Francois Mitterrand personally thanked Gadhafi for his
``determining'' role in freeing the three hostages. Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas said French-Libyan relations would improve
because of his ``noble and humanitarian gesture.''
   U.S. State Department officials welcomed the hostages' release
but criticized France's warm words for Gadhafi.
   ``Such rhetoric is nauseating,'' the British newspaper The
Independent wrote in an editorial, reflecting the view of numerous
newspapers across Western Europe. ``To describe the reversing of a
criminal act as high-minded and humanitarian carries Realpolitik
too far, even by French standards.''
   Le Monde, a respected French daily, asked in a front-page
commentary: ``Must we give a certificate of good behavior to the
Libyan leader, who perhaps wasn't even expecting that much?''
   French Foreign Ministry officials said privately they were
``shocked'' by such ``biased'' and ``scandalous'' commentary. Dumas
said those who criticized the praise for Gadhafi were ``being
picky.''
   Newspapers in France and across Western Europe claimed France
exchanged three fighter planes for the three hostages. Defense
Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement denied this, saying there was no
link between the hostages' freedom and France's recent decision to
release the three Mirage jets owned by Libya and held in France
four years.
   Dumas said negotiations for the release of the hostages were
handled on a ``state to state'' level. France ``did not speak with
the abductors,'' he said.
   However, the conservative daily Le Figaro reported that Foreign
Ministry envoys handled the diplomatic negotiations, while French
counterespionage agents made contacts with Abu Nidal's group.
   The unsourced article claimed the Libyan navy abducted the
hostages, mistaking them for Israelis. When the error was
discovered, the hostages were transferred to Abu Nidal's group to
be used as a bargaining chip by Libya.
   The newspaper said the chief point in a ``contract'' to free the
hostages centered on the lifting of a French arms embargo against
Libya. It was set up in 1983 when the two nations backed different
sides in Chad's civil war.
   Paul Wilkinson, director of the Research Institute for the Study
of Conflict and Terrorism, said the hostage release proves an
ongoing link between Gadhafi and Abu Nidal.
   ``The public should be warned against euphoria over the latest
hostage release in Lebanon,'' Wilkinson said in London. ``It was
obtained by a deal which violates the European Community policy of
`no concessions under duress to terrorists or their sponsors.'''
   In addition, such actions ``encourage terrorist states and
groups to believe that big rewards can be gained and put more
innocent lives at risk,'' he said.
   Tuesday's liberation was the second time Libya intervened on
France's behalf for the hostages. Two other daughters of Ms.
Valente were freed in December 1989. France also thanked Libya
then. It was seen as an image booster for Gadhafi, who was being
virulently attacked in the West.

   Even in Antarctica, one parking-ticket scofflaw
wasn't able to escape the long arm of the law.
   Warrant officers Lori Nelson and Sally Cruse of Seattle
Municipal Court spent about four months trying to find the woman, a
scientist on a Seattle-based research ship who owed the city $845
in unpaid parking fines.
   The payment came in the mail recently, sent via Chile from
Antarctica, where the ship is stationed.
   ``It was kind of weird,'' Nelson said. ``When we got the letter,
I looked at the stamps and saw that they were from Chile.''
   ``Her car had an Idaho license. We had about two or three
addresses for her and the letters kept getting forwarded,'' said
Cruse, who did not release the scientist's name.
   ``She finally wrote us a letter and sent us the money. She
didn't want us bugging her any more. She wanted to clear her good
name and come back to Seattle eventually without being arrested,''
Cruse said.
   In another case, officers recently tracked down a woman in
Switzerland who paid the city $1,200 in outstanding fines, Cruse
said.
   A year ago, the city had more than $10 million in outstanding
parking tickets.
   ``We're obviously making a dent in this,'' Cruse said.

   Two accused horse thieves landed in the

can tell horse from the cow variety.
   Police Cpl. Steven Craighead was on patrol early Tuesday in this
Dallas suburb when he spotted a pickup truck pulling a new trailer
similar to one a friend had bought Friday.
   After stopping the vehicle for not having a license plate, one
of the things that didn't make sense to Craighead was the scents.
   The trailer was carrying three horses, but it had cattle manure
in it, says Craighead. He also knew that his friend had hauled
cattle in his new trailer.
   ``The driver of the trailer told a lot of stories that didn't
jibe, and our dispatcher was able to confirm that the truck hauling
the trailer was stolen out of Dallas,'' Craighhead said.
   A 20-year-old Dallas man and a 19-year-old Garland woman were in
jail Wednesday awaiting arraignment on burglary and theft charges.

   Friends and relatives of Brian
Keenan held a two-hour vigil in his native Belfast on Wednesday as
Keenan began his fifth year in captivity in Lebanon.
   No group has claimed to hold Keenan, a 39-year-old English
teacher, but he was seen being kidnapped by gunmen April 11, 1986,
as he walked to the American University of Beirut in the city's
Moslem sector.
   In Belfast, prayers were said as members of the Friends of Brian
Keenan Action Group gathered in the city center. The release of
three European hostages in Lebanon on Tuesday encouraged the
gathering.
   Keenan's sister, Brenda Gillham, said she would never give up
hope that her brother would be released.
   ``It's very hard to explain how I'm feeling today. You feel sad,
but are still hopeful. You never give up hope,'' Mrs. Gillham said.
   In Beirut, a Lebanese police spokesman said he had no
information on either Keenan or any of the other 17 Westerners held
hostage mainly by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem factions in Lebanon.
   ``We only have routine files on the hostages. Their case is
largely considered as a non-domestic issue,'' the spokesman said,
speaking on condition of anonymity in line with police regulations.
   ``The hostages may be held on Lebanese territory, by some
Lebanese tools, but those who can determine their fate are
certainly not Lebanese,'' he added.
   He apparently was referring to Iran, whose closest ally in
Lebanon is Hezbollah, or Party of God, the umbrella group for
hostage-holding factions. There have been periodic reports that
some hostages were turned over to Iran's Revolutionary Guards in
Lebanon for security.
   In addition to Keenan, the foreign captives are eight Americans,
four Britons, two Swiss, two West Germans and an Italian.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   They are considered separate from four Belgians held by Abu
Nidal's Libya-backed Palestinian group.
   Abu Nidal's group freed three other captives on Tuesday.
Frenchwoman Jacqueline Valente, 32, Belgian Fernand Houtekins, 43,
and their 2-year-old daughter Sophie-Liberte were flown Tuesday
night to Paris after being released to French diplomats earlier in
the day.
   A Tehran newspaper on Wednesday said the release of the three
should be a prelude to the release of all hostages, as their
captivity contradicted Islamic teachings.
   The English-language daily Tehran Times, which often reflects
the opinions of President Hashemi Rafsanjani, said: ``In fact the
issue of hostage taking should come to an end for all with no
discrimination.''
   It was the third time in as many months that the newspaper had
advocated the release of Western hostages.
   Rafsanjani and other Iranian moderates have stressed their
support for releasing the hostages, seeing it as a way of improving
ties with the West at a time Iran seeks financing and technical aid.
   But radical hard-liners, who apparently hold greater sway over
those holding the hostages, have repeatedly said they support
hostage-taking as a way to confront the ``corrupt'' West.

   A 29-year-old Atlas
rocket that once was armed with nuclear warheads thundered into
space Wednesday, carrying three small research satellites into a
polar orbit.
   ``It took off quickly and was gone in an instant,'' said Air
Force spokesman Maj. Tom Worsdale. ``Everyone was pleased with the
smoothness of the operation and the success of the launch.''
   The 91-foot-tall Atlas-E, topped by a 5-foot-tall Scout-Altair
upper stage booster, blasted off the pad at Space Launch Complex 3
at 8 a.m. PDT, emerging from a low fog bank over this sprawling
coastal military base 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   The liquid-fueled Atlas, similar to the rocket that lifted John
Glenn to orbit Earth in 1962, flew south over the Pacific. Fifteen
minutes after liftoff, the solid fuel upper stage separated from
the payload, delivering the three satellites into a polar orbit 460
miles above Earth, Worsdale said.
   The mission cost $22 million, said Ed Parsons, chief spokesman
for the Air Force's Space Systems Division in Los Angeles.
   One satellite will test new computer memory circuits and measure
Earth's magnetic field to help make navigation charts used by ships
and planes.
   The others will test a new communications device and study
phenomena in Earth's upper atmosphere that interfere with
space-to-ground radio communications, said Capt. Mark Goodman,
project manager.
   The Atlas was built in 1961 by General Dynamics and once served
as a nuclear warhead-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile at
Forbes Air Force Base in Kansas. It was refurbished in 1987 for use
as a launch vehicle.
   The Air Force originally planned to launch the three satellites
on a Scout rocket, but none was available. Atlas-E rockets normally
launch larger payloads, such as weather satellites. The Atlas
launched Wednesday had what the Air Force described only as
``slightly degraded performance'' that prevented it from lofting a
heavier payload.
   Each satellite weighs only 120 to 150 pounds.
   The uppermost satellite, named Polar Orbiting Geomagnetic
Survey, contains a magnetometer to measure the strength of the
Earth's magnetic field at various locations.
   The data will be used to help draw new Defense Mapping Agency
geomagnetic charts. Many ships and aircraft navigate using
computerized versions of the charts, which are updated every five
years as the magnetic field changes, Goodman said.
   The satellite also contains the Solid State Recorder experiment,
meant to demonstrate the use of high-speed integrated circuit
designs as computer memory devices in space, and to make sure they
can withstand the radiation in space, Parsons said.
   The second satellite, named TEX, or Transceiver Experiment, will
bounce radio signals of different power levels off the ionosphere,
the part of Earth's upper atmosphere containing irregularities that
can disrupt high-frequency radio communications.
   The third satellite, the Selective Communications Experiment,
will conduct similar studies by bouncing radio signals of varying
frequencies off the ionosphere. The Air Force hopes to learn what
power and frequency levels can be used to overcome disruption of
radio communications.

<HEAD>Opposition Alliance Sets Conditions For Joining Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition movement that successfully
campaigned for the restoration of multiparty democracy in this
Himalayan kingdom set conditions Wednesday for joining a proposed
interim government.
   The centrist Nepali Congress Party and the United Left Front, a
left-wing coalition, refused to join the interim government unless
it was headed by either King Birendra or their own nominee.
   The opposition groups said they would not accept a member of the
non-partisan Rashtriya Panchayat, or national assembly, as prime
minister.
   ``We shall never agree to a person becoming a prime minister who
is not a member of either party or the king himself,'' Nepali
Congress Party President K.P. Bhattarai told reporters.
   The two groups set out their conditions in a joint statement
that responded to Birendra's invitation to join an interim
government. The king Sunday bowed to nationwide protsts organized
by the groups and lifted a 29-year ban on political parties.
   The statement urged the immediate dissolution of the national
assembly and the repeal of portions of the constitution considered
``incompatible'' with a multiparty democracy.
   Meanwhile, state-run radio reported that the government has
decided to drop all criminal cases against people arrested during
the seven-week pro-democracy campaign.
   Bhattarai said the opposition also wanted compensation for
families of those killed during the crackdown and punishment of
officials found guilty through an independent investigation of
``atrocities'' in suppressing protests. Unless the conditions are
met, Bhattarai said, the Nepali Congress Party and United Left
Front will not join the provisional government.
   ``We are willing to give them a reasonable period of time to
fulfill the demands,'' he added.
   Sahana Pradhan, chairwoman of the seven-party United Left Front,
said all the groups in the left-wing coalition supported the
demands in the joint statement.
   ``At present we agree,'' she said without elaborating.
   The role of the king in the new political system remains unclear.
   Earlier Wednesday, Foreign Minister Pashupati Shamsher Rana said
Birendra had given up participation in active politics and wanted
the government to ``soothe and heal the wounds'' caused by the
crackdown on the democracy campaign.
   The statement was the first admission by a government official
of the king's diminished importance in Nepal's new democratic
system.
   Rana said the king, by dropping the word ``partyless'' from the
constitution, has ``relinquished participation in active politics.''
   But state-run radio continued to refer to the government as
``His Majesty's government'' on Wednesday.
   Political parties were banned in Nepal 29 years ago when the
democratically elected government formed by the Nepali Congress
Party was dismissed by King Mahendra, Birendra's father.
   The Nepali Congress Party went underground to push for a
restoration of multiparty democracy, and the left-wing coalition
joined the campaign.
   The movement was formally launched Feb. 18 and drew support from
academicians, professionals and peasants. It peaked with a series
of strikes and demonstrations last week.
   Witnesses said 200 people were killed Friday alone when police
fired on pro-democracy protesters. The government said only 10
people were killed.
   Birendra, 44, is the heir of the Shaha dynasty that has held the
throne since the middle of the 18th century. Many Nepalis,
especially illiterate farmers who form the bulk of this country's
17 million people, view him as the reincarnation of the Hindu god
Vishnu.

<HEAD>Maker Reiterates Call for Owners to Modify Play Sets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hedstrom Inc., a manufacturer of backyard
gyms, is renewing its call for customers to modify several models
of the children's play sets to guard against potential injuries.
   The Pennsylvania-based company said this week it wants to hear
from about 256,000 owners of its backyard gym sets equipped with
``glide rides.''
   Hedstrom said it would provide free guards for the gliders,
which are suspended from the top bar of the gym sets.
   Children standing on the slide or crossbar of the gliders and
reaching up to propel or stop the ride and have ``entrapped or
pinched a finger in the bracket mechanism,'' causing severed
fingertips and severe cuts, the company said.
   As temperatures rise and children head outdoors to play, the
company has become concerned because there has been such low
consumer response to a November 1988 repair program, the Consumer
Product Safety Commission said in an announcement reinstituting the
original offer.
   In addition, there have been 19 more serious injuries reported
in connection with the sets since the program began, the CPSC said.
   The program involves Hedstrom and Sears models of the gyms sold
nationwide from 1982 to July 1, 1988. Approximately 370,000 sets
were sold but only about 14,000 consumers have requested the free
glide guards, said the CPSC.
   Affected models can be identified by reading the model label
found on the top bar. They include: Hedstrom models numbered 4-277,
4-377, 4-677, 4-778, 4-877 and Sears brand models 72226, 72066,
72026.
   Customers may contact Hedstrom at 1-800-233-3271 outside
Pennsylvania, or 1-800-242-9034 in the state. Buyers of the gym
sets may also write the company at Department 100, P.O. Box 432,
Bedford, Pa. 15522-0432.

   A freight company was found responsible
Wednesday for the suffocation deaths of 79 beagles being shipped to
Sweden and was fined $8,200.
   A magistrates court also ordered Monock Freight to pay $6,800 in
legal costs.
   The dogs suffocated in a Monock Freight truck trailer on board
the ferry Tor Britannia in the North Sea on Sept. 5, 1989,
according to testimony presented in court.
   A total of 100 beagles were being shipped to the Astra
pharmaceutical company in Sweden for use in experiments testing
drugs, said Astra spokesman Staffan Ternby.
   Five hours after the ship left the port of Harwich, the truck
driver, Henry Stevens, found that only 21 beagles were still alive,
and 10 of them were unconscious.
   The temperature inside the truck was 95 degrees, Swedish police
said.The truck did not have a ventilation system.
   Monock Freight denied the charge of causing unnecessary
suffering but the magistrates in Harwich, 80 miles northeast of
London, found the firm guilty.
   Before sentencing, magistrate chairman Thomas Bernard heard that
Monock Freight director John Weber had received hate mail and
needed 24-hour protection due to threats from animal rights
activists.
   Perrycroft Farm Kennels, which owned the 8-month-old beagles,
pleaded guilty to charges of causing unnecessary suffering and was
fined $21,000 by Harwich magistrates in February.
   The 21 surviving beagles were placed as pets in Swedish homes,
Ternby said.

   The Moslem campaign for an independent
Kashmir spread to Bombay on Wednesday with a bomb attack that
wounded 34 people and brought Indian relations with Pakistan to a
new peak of anger.
   United News of India, a news agency, said frontier guards shot
and killed seven Kashmiri militants who were trying to cross
illegally into Pakistan, which borders the Kashmir valley.
   Indian and Pakistan, which have in the past waged war over
Kashmir, traded bitter words over the latest violence. Pakistani
troops were put on high alert Wednesday after India's leader talked
of war.
   The Indian news agency quoted unidentified officials as saying
the militants were killed while trying to escape a dragnet spread
across the valley by security forces.
   Authorities were cracking down in a search for killers of three
men abducted last week by Moslem separatists demanding the release
of three jailed colleagues. The bodies were found Tuesday in the
far northern city of Srinagar, the hub of the secession drive.
   Jammu-Kashmir state officials said 64 people were arrested
during the searches, but it was not known if they were connected
with the killing of the hostages.
   The bomb rocked the train near Malad station on the outskirts of
Bombay, about 1,000 miles south of Srinagar on India's west coast.
Authorities said 34 people were wounded.
   A man purporting to speak for the ``Mujahedeen Kashmir,'' or
Islamic Holy Warriors of Kashmir, telephoned reporters in Srinagar
and claimed responsibility for the explosion.
   The group was first heard of Tuesday when it claimed
responsibility for bomb blasts that injured at least nine policemen
in two New Delhi police stations.
   The New Delhi and Bombay bombings were the first time the Moslem
separatists claimed responsibility for attacks outside Kashmir
since the government launched a crackdown on secessionists Jan. 20.
At least 260 people have been killed in Kashmir during the
crackdown.
   The separatists in India's Jammu-Kashmir state want to break
their Moslem-dominated region from the rest of India, which is
mainly Hindu.
   The old princely state of Kashmir was split between India and
Moslem-dominated Pakistan when the two countries were partitioned
along religious lines after independence from Britain in 1947. The
frontier is still disputed, and the two countries went to war over
Kashmir in 1948 and 1965.
   In Srinagar on Wednesday, army troops in camouflage battle dress
cordoned off the area where the bodies were found and began
house-to-house searches for the killers, witnesses said. A 24-hour
curfew was in effect for the sixth straight day.
   The killings of the hostages, who included a vice chancellor at
Kashmir University, were a departure from the militants' previous
practices. In the past, the militants only killed civilians accused
of being police informers.
   ``The dastardly murders ... are the grossest violations of human
rights where innocent persons are being made victims of senseless,
externally inspired and motivated violence,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Aftab Seth told reporters Wednesday in New Delhi.
   He said the events in Kashmir indicated ``a sinister pattern of
incitement to violence being orchestrated by so-called leaders of
Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and by elements within Pakistan itself.''
   Pakistan has denied involvement in the Indian conflict.
   On Tuesday, Prime Minister V.P. Singh said Indians should be
``psychologically prepared'' for another armed conflict with
Pakistan over Kashmir.
   On Wednesday, Pakistan's military leader put his troops on high
alert.
   Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, the military chief, told a meeting of
commanders in Rawalpindi that Singh's ``threatening statements . .
. call for a high state of preparedness and vigilance to frustrate
the designs of the enemy.''
   The Pakistani Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing
``deep regret and disappointment at yet another threat of war by
the top leadership of India.''
   In New Delhi, dozens of supporters of a new Hindu militant
group, the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Army, marched to the Pakistan
Embassy on Wednesday.
   ``We will crush Pakistan!'' they shouted.
   The group was formed last month to counter the Jammu-Kashmir
Liberation Front, the biggest of several Moslem secessionist groups
in the Kashmir valley.

<HEAD>Angolan Government Agrees to Begin Talks With Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Angola's Marxist government has agreed
to start direct peace talks this month with U.S.-backed rebels to
end their 15-year-old civil war, the official Angolan news agency
reported Wednesday.
   A rebel spokesman welcomed the announcement, which followed his
side's offer Monday of an immediate cease-fire. The guerrillas had
also proposed talks.
   An initial truce and June talks mediated by President Mobutu
Sese Seko of Zaire collapsed within weeks, and fighting has
intensified in recent months.
   In a dispatch released Wednesday in Lisbon, the ANGOP news
agency quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura of Angola
as saying: ``Probably this month (and) next month, representatives
of the Angolan government and elements of UNITA will meet to
discuss the internal problem.''
   The rebels of UNITA, or National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, are led by Jonas Savimbi.
   The Angolan news agency quoted sources in Luanda, Angola's
capital, as saying initial direct contacts would be held in
Portugal, probably April 16, with later talks in the West African
archipelago of Cape Verde. Angola, in southwestern Africa, is a
former Portuguese colony that gained independence in 1975.
   A UNITA spokesman in Lisbon, Norberto de Castro, said he had
received no official confirmation of the ANGOP report, but he
welcomed the government proposal.
   He said it is a sign the government ``understands the
situation.''
   ``For us, any date will do'' for talks, de Castro told The
Associated Press in the telephone interview.
   A spokesman for the Portuguese Foreign Ministry said his country
would be prepared to play host to the talks but had received no
official confirmation.
   In recent months, Angolan government forces have pressed deep
into the rebel's southeastern heartlands. UNITA, meanwhile, has
stepped up urban bomb and sabotage attacks in Luanda.
   The stalemate has apparently put pressure on hard-liners from
both sides to give up the idea of military victory and return to
the negotiating table.
   In addition, the superpowers, eager to end one of the last
vestiges of the Cold War, have been pushing both sides to make
peace. U.S. aid to UNITA is reportedly $50 million or more a year,
and Western experts put Soviet aid to the Angolan government much
higher.
   Angola agreed in a 1988 U.S.-brokered accord that an estimated
50,000 Cuban troops backing its forces would be withdrawn.
   UNITA says the war has killed more than 200,000 people.
   Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro van Dunem of Angola was quoted
in a separate ANGOP dispatch as saying UNITA's proposal for a
cease-fire and talks in Lisbon ``seem to be more realistic ... and
show a certain willingness to (end) the conflict peacefully.''
   He reaffirmed the government's willingness to reopen the peace
process immediately, saying the Angolan people ``are tired of war
and suffering,'' according to ANGOP.
   Issues expected to be discussed at talks include forming a
transitional government, demobilization of armies, Savimbi's
political future, and possibly elections.
   Government sources in Luanda said they expected a cease-fire
could be signed by July.

   Ivar Lo-Johansson, a Swedish novelist
whose powerful stories about landless peasants spurred farm reforms
60 years ago, died Wednesday at age 89.
   Lo-Johansson suffered from cancer, and his condition had
declined rapidly in recent weeks, the Swedish TT news agency quoted
his doctor as saying.
   The son of a farm worker, Lo-Johansson receied little formal
schooling but rose to become one of Sweden's most prolific authors.
   He became a force among the ``proletarian writers,'' who based
their stories on the lives of poor workers and peasants. His
writings in the 1930s helped end a system under which farm workers
were strongly dependent on land owners.
   Lo-Johansson wrote some 60 works from 1927 to 1986. In 1985,
France named him an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters.

<HEAD>Economy, Lithuania Show Government's New Strength, Gorbachev's New
Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A month after creating a presidential structure
with himself as head, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has shifted the burden
of setting policy on the economy and Lithuania from the Communist
Party to new government bodies.
   But his closest adviser has left no doubt that it is neither the
party nor new government bodies that make the final decisions: it
is Gorbachev himself.
   On Saturday, Gorbachev says he will meet with his two new
presidential advisory groups, the Presidential Council and the
Council of the Federation, to agree on a new set of economic
reforms. They are expected to be by far the most radical the Soviet
leader has attempted.
   After Lithuania last week rejected Gorbachev's demand to
renounce its declaration of independence in order to open talks
with Moscow, the Kremlin's reaction came from the Presidential
Council.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said Monday that ``Members of the
Presidential Council concluded that additional economic, political
and other measures should be taken to protect the Soviet
Constitution and the interests of citizens living in the republic
and the Soviet Union as a whole.''
   Gorbachev also has consulted with the Council of the Federation,
made up of representatives of each Soviet republic, on the
Lithuania dispute.
   Meanwhile, the Communist Party's Politburo and Central Committee
have been silent. For decades they have been at the heart of Soviet
decision-making, leaving the government only to implement their
directives. But Gorbachev has pledged to reduce their power to
making broad policy decisions.
   Gorbachev remains the Communist Party chief, as he has been for
the past five years, but his election to the post of president
symbolized that pledge. And the shift of emphasis since then on his
biggest policy headaches, Lithuania and the economy, appears to
confirm that such a change really is taking place.
   Gorbachev's point man on economic reform, Deputy Premier Leonid
Abalkin, bluntly told reporters the Politburo no longer would be
forming economic policy.
   ``The Politburo will not be making any decisions from now on,
and it is already not making the decisions,'' he said. ``Decisions
can be made by the president, the parliament and the Congress of
People's Deputies. Those are the decision-making entities now.''
   The Presidential Council is a hand-picked advisory committee
including such top Gorbachev advisers as Politburo member Alexander
N. Yakovlev and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. For
balance, it includes conservatives like writer Valentin Rasputin of
Irkutsk and workers' representative Veniamin Yarin of
Nizhni-Tagilsk.
   Yakovlev, in an interview with Tass last week, emphasized that
Gorbachev might turn to the Presidential Council for advice, but
that it is up to the president to decide.
   ``The goal of creating the Presidential Council is to serve as a
consultative organ to the new institution of power in the country,
to help form and bring to life the political line of the president
as part of the general policy of the Soviet government,'' Yakovlev
said.
   ``In any instance, the right to choose, the right of decision
belongs to the president,'' he added. ``The council can and must
analyze, work out proposals, make recommendations, raise questions
of its own initiative.''
   Its formation gives Gorbachev the power to bypass more
conservative Politburo members like Yegor K. Ligachev and take
policy questions to a group more closely in tune with his own
views. The new structure seems to have vested Gorbachev with more
power than he wielded even as Communist Party chief.
   Despite five years of reforms, the party's Central Committee
still is riddled with party bureaucrats who are suspicious of his
reforms. And the Central Committee must make any changes in the
Politburo.
   In recent months, as Gorbachev established the new presidential
form of government, the Central Committee was limited to adopting a
new platform that endorsed the reforms Gorbachev sought to make.
   After tough debate, it agreed to surrender its monopoly on
political power and to endorse the principle of private property.
   In explaining to a congress of the Komsomol Communist youth
league on Tuesday how officials will put a new economic program
into place, Gorbachev left little room for the Communist Party
apparatus.
   He said the two councils would forward their recommendation
directly to the public for debate.

   Fire doors malfunctioned and
ventilation ducts were left open to fan the flames of the deadly
fire that gutted the ferry Scandinavian Star, a fire inspector told
a hearing Wednesday.
   But the captain of the Danish ship told the inquiry that all the
fire equipment and safety procedures worked, and that the crew
performed well in the emergency.
   Captain Hugo Larsen, of Norway, said he was awakened by a ship's
officer at 1:55 a.m. Saturday and told, ``Someone is playing
arsonist,'' as the first of three fires was discovered aboard the
ship.
   In Oslo, police reduced the number of dead and missing to 168,
as more missing passengers reported to police. At least one
American was among the dead. Officials in Sweden, where the ship
was towed, said they recovered 127 bodies and had estimated up to
200 may have died.
   About 500 people were on board the ship in the North Sea.
   One unidentified West German was discovered trying to swindle
authorities for compensation by reporting five family members on
board, a police official said.
   The fire broke out when the 10,500-ton Scandinavian Star was
midway on an overnight trip from Oslo, Norway, to Fredrickshaven,
Denmark.
   Arson was the ``highly probable'' cause, but no motive has been
found, said Oslo police chief Magnar Aukrust. At the Copenhagen
inquiry, fire inspector Flemming Jensen pinpointed fires in three
separate places.
   The first was in a pile of woolen blankets in a passageway
outside a cabin below the car deck. It was quickly doused by a
ship's officer.
   The other two began shortly afterward in stairwells on either
side of the ferry, Jensen said. The blaze spread up the staircases,
past several decks and burst into the main restaurant area, he said.
   The three fires must have ignited independently, he said, but he
did not speculate on their causes.
   After a five-hour tour of the 470-foot vessel at its mooring in
Lysekil, Sweden, Jensen said only five of the vessel's 15 fire
doors closed as they should have during the blaze. Hatches to the
ship's ventilation ducts also were left open, he said.
   Fire doors are made of metal or other fire-resistant material
and are designed to keep fires from spreading.
   ``The firefighting equipment was in good shape, but it appeared
not to have been in use,'' Jensen said.
   The ferry lacked one fire door on the main deck between the
restaurant area and the open stern deck. It should have been added
during a recent renovation and expansion of the restaurant area, he
said.
   Larsen admitted under questioning that alarm bells were
disconnected in corridors and cabins because of too many false
alarms. But he said pressing the alarm button set off lights on the
bridge, and each was investigated by an officer.
   The Scandinavian Star, registered in the Bahamas, caught fire
two years in the Gulf of Mexico when it was American-owned, and a
U.S. investigation pointed out flaws in safety and training of the
crew.
   The ship was bought last month by Da-No Lines, based in
Copenhagen.
   Larsen, who has been accused of abandoning the ship too early,
said he and his crew did ``everything humanly possible'' to save
lives before leaving in the last lifeboat.
   Looking haggard and answering questions with a word or half
sentence, Larsen said he had ``no idea about people below decks.''
   ``I knew there were some passengers on the stern deck and called
for a rescue boat from the (ferry) Stena Saga to pick them up,
which happened,'' he said.
   He said he left when he could no longer stay on the bridge
because of heavy smoke.
   Larsen, who along with the other crew and surviving passengers
was rescued by a Swedish ferry, returned to the burning
Scandinavian Star five hours later to help firefighters start the
ship's water pumps.
   The inquiry was expected to hear 15 to 20 witnesses during the
next three or four days and is coordinating its findings with those
of Norwegian and Swedish authorities.
   At a meeting late Tuesday, the maritime directors of Sweden,
Norway and Denmark approved tighter measures to inspect ships
flying foreign flags of convenience in Nordic waters.
   The commission decided that the foreign-flagged ships must in
the future undergo safety checks by a Nordic maritime authority and
the crew must demonstrate firefighting skills.
   About 60 million passengers travel Nordic routes every year.

<HEAD>Bush Issues Executive Order Protecting Chinese Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday issued the
executive order he promised last November to protect Chinese
students from deportation to their politically troubled homeland.
   Bush's order directs the attorney general to defer until Jan. 1,
1994, any deportation procedings against Chinese nationals who were
in the United States on or after June 5, 1989, and whose visas
expire.
   Many Chinese students fear reprisals because they supported the
pro-democracy movement that was crushed when the Beijing government
turned military tanks on its own people in Tiananmen Square last
spring.
   Instead of starting deportation proceedings, the government will
notify the Chinese nationals when their visas expire, under the
order signed by Bush.
   Such Chinese nationals also will have the right to seek
employment in the United States through Jan. 1, 1994, under terms
set forth by Bush.
   A requirement that Chinese nationals must have valid passports
will be waived, under the order. The government also will furnish
documents to ``facilitate travel across the borders of other
nations and reentry into the United States'' for those whose
passports expired, under the order.
   Bush had announced he would protect the Chinese students who
feared persecution following Beijing's brutal crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators last June.
   On Nov. 30 he vetoed legislation designed to extend visa
protections to the Chinese nationals. But he said then that he
would issue an executive order to guarantee that no one would be
forced to return to China.
   Instead of issuing the executive order, Bush initially produced
a directive containing guidelines for immigration officials.
   That brought a rash of published reports and congressional
criticism.
   On Friday, he pledged anew to issue the order. ``We don't want
to take a chance on people being mistreated, brutalized,'' Bush
said.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
175,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for delivery
through mid-May under a long-term grain supply agreement, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was sold by three
private companies, which will receive subsidies under the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Dickerson said 712,950 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation. Only wheat has been approved for
sale to the Soviets under the price subsidy program.
   The seventh year of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement began Oct. 1.
   With the latest sales, the Soviet Union has bought more than 3
million tons of wheat for 1989-90 delivery and more than 12.7
million tons of corn, plus soybeans and soybean meal. All of the
wheat was sold under EEP arrangements.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 175,000 tons are equal to more than 6.4 million
bushels worth about $23 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $34.13 per
ton, or about 93 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest wheat was sold by J. Aron &amp; Co.,
100,000 tons; Union Equity Cooperative Exchange, 50,000; and
Mitsubishi International, 25,000.

   A man convicted of raping a 15-year-old
California hitchhiker and hacking off her arms faced a Florida
charge Wednesday of trying to steal a $10 disposable camera from a
drugstore, authorities said.
   Lawrence Singleton, 62, wasn't jailed following his arrest
Sunday in suburban Tampa, but was given notice to appear in court
May 2 on the misdemeanor charge of petty theft, authorities said.
   A security guard at a store in Brandon spotted him taking a
$9.98 disposable camera, according to a sheriff's report.
   Singleton was convicted of raping runaway Mary Vincent, cutting
off her forearms with an ax then leaving her for dead in 1978.
   Singleton was freed in 1987 after serving eight years, four
months of a 14-year sentence.
   He attempted to live quietly in several California communities
after his release, but public outrage when his identity was
discovered forced authorities to keep moving him for his own
protection. He wound up in the Tampa area a year later.
   Singleton told deputies he lives at his sister's house in
eastern Hillsborough County. A woman who answered the telephone
there said Singleton stays alternately with his sister and his
brother, who lives in northwest Tampa. The brother refused to
comment.

<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines paid the government
$215,000 in fines for safety violations, including failure to make
required repairs on two airliners, the Federal Aviation
Administration said Wednesday.
   The fines were proposed by the FAA after a five-week inspection
of its operations more than a year ago, said FAA spokesman Fred
Farrar.
   He said Continental responded quickly to remedy violations cited.
   The deficiencies included improper weighing of an aircraft, use
of out-of-date performance and planning manuals at eight airports,
operation of a Boeing 727 without repairing a faulty escape slide
and failure to repair a cargo hold heater on a DC-10 within the
required time.
   Other fines against Continental resulting from the inspection
and other inspections are being considered, Farrar said. He said it
routinely takes lawyers from several months to a year or more to
prepare proposed fines following inspections.
   Several thousand cases involving possible fines against various
airlines are pending.
   Under a new policy announced last month by FAA Administrator
James Busey, airlines will be able to escape penalties if they
quickly report and correct safety violations.
   The FAA has the authority to levy fines of $1,000 against
individuals and $10,000 against airlines for each safety violation
without filing charges in court.
   The Continental inspection, described as one of the most
extensive ever undertaken by the FAA, involved 50 government
inspectors in October and November 1988 at several airports used by
the airline.

   Sixty guests gathered at the French
ambassador's home Wednesday to pay homage to the Marquis de
Lafayette, hero of the American Revolution, over a candlelight
dinner featuring dishes from the menu at Lafayette's wedding feast
in 1774.
   A crier in powdered wig and knee britches announced each guest
and a trio of costumed chamber musicians played Mozart and other
18th century favorites for the black-tie dinner given by Le Cordon
Bleu, the famed Paris cooking school.
   Those lucky enough to receive invitations to one of the most
exclusive social events of Washington's spring season dined on a
jelly of oysters in caviar cream sauce, filet of sole, baby squab
served in silver cups and a slab of roast venison on a spit which
was carried into the dining room on the shoulders of two chefs.
   Goblets under the Baccarat crystal candelabra, which were
decorated with cascades of pink roses, tulips and spring flowers,
were filled with six fine French wines and champagne.
   Dessert was chocolate-covered pineapple ice cream, served in a
pineapple shell held by three sculpted chocolate hands. The palate
freshener for the seven-course dinner was a sorbet laced with
cognac from the 900-acre Cointreau estate in France.
   ``The guests were pleased to receive invitations, but some
people were very displeased they were not coming,'' said Andre
Cointreau, a descendant of the French liqueur producers and
president of Le Cordon Bleu. ``We were sorry we could not
accommodate everyone.''
   Besides French Ambassador Jacques Andreani, the guest list
included leading Washington journalists and food writers, former
U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter and Katharine Graham, chairman of the Washington Post Co.
   Patrick Martin, 32, a rising star among classical French chefs
and a master teacher at Le Cordon Bleu, arrived 10 days ago to
begin preparing the dinner. He was assisted by four chefs who
labored in the white-tiled basement kitchen of the ambassador's
residence in northwest Washington.
   Cointreau said the dinner Wednesday night included authentic
recreations of several foods from the staggering array of 200
dishes served in 30 courses at Lafayette's wedding feast exactly
216 years ago.
   Lafayette, then just 16, married Adrienne de Noailles, a
daughter of one of the wealthiest and most influential families in
France, in a Paris ceremony that took place shortly before
Lafayette became a captain in the French cavalry.
   Three years later, Lafayette sailed to America and joined the
Revolutionary War as an honorary major general under the command of
his close friend, George Washington. He was credited with the
defensive military maneuvers that resulted in the British surrender
at Yorktown in 1781.
   Cointreau said the dinner was conceived five years ago as an
expression of gratitude to American oil magnate John Moffat, who
early in this century bought and restored the crumbling
Chavagnal-Lafayette castle in the Auvergne region where Lafayette
was born.
   Moffat housed several hundred French orphans from World War I at
the castle, which is now held by trustees of the nonprofit
Lafayette Memorial.
   ``The dinner is our way of saying thank you to America, and the
best way to say thank you is to have good people sitting down
together at a very good dinner,'' Cointreau said.

   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres won additional
time to put together a governing coalition after the last-minute
defection of two religious lawmakers Wednesday spoiled his
immediate hopes of becoming prime minister.
   Shouting matches erupted in Parliament after attempts to form a
new government failed. The breakdown renewed anger in Israel over
the disproportionate influence of small right-wing religious
parties, which serve as kingmakers in any attempt to form a
governing coalition.
   ``Whoever says this is democracy is speaking nonsense,'' said
Amnon Rubinstein of the left-wing Shinui Party. ``We can't continue
with this method.''
   President Chaim Herzog granted Peres 15 more days to pull
together a government. Peres has vowed to make peace negotiations
with Palestinians his first priority.
   He ruled out a return to the Likud-Labor government, which
collapsed March 15 over peace moves. The right-wing Likud refused
to accept U.S. proposals paving the way for Israeli-Palestinian
talks in Cairo.
   ``Let's never forget that the government fell on the issue of
peace. Let's remember that the issue of peace should be the major
consideration,'' Peres told reporters.
   Peres had planned to present his coalition to the Knesset, or
Parliament, for approval Wednesday. He was counting on the support
of 61 of the 120 legislators, including five from the
ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel party.
   But hours before the vote, Agudat lawmaker Avraham Verdiger
announced that he had resigned from Parliament. Party colleague
Eliezer Mizrahi then said he would vote against Peres.
   Lawmakers shouted at the top of their lungs, pounded on tables
and wagged fingers at each other when it became clear Peres lacked
a majority. Each speaker was interrupted repeatedly.
   Abdul Wahab Daroushe, an Arab parliamentarian, demanded that
Knesset speaker Dov Shilansky ``denounce those who rule out Israeli
Arabs from taking part in the decision-making process.''
   Hard-liner Eliakim Haetzni jumped up from his seat and lunged
toward Daroushe but was restrained by guards.
   Mohammed Miari, another member of Parliament, screamed at
Haetzni: ``You're a racist, you're a murderer!''
   Both Verdiger and Mizrahi are political hard-liners opposed to
the center-left Labor Party's philosophy of accepting territorial
compromise in exchange for peace.
   When he announced he was quitting, Verdiger said he had sought
the advice of the Lubavitcher Rabbi Menachem Schneerson of
Brooklyn, N.Y., a leading Hasidic figure with great influence in
Israel although he has never been to the Jewish state.
   ``The rabbi said that nothing has changed in his position on
Eretz Israel,'' Verdiger said on Israel radio. Schneerson has
written that the biblical land of Israel, including occupied
territory, was given by God to the Jews and must not be surrendered.
   Rubinstein responded with anger and said the defections
strengthened calls for electoral reform including direct election
of the prime minister.
   ``We want to ask the country which prime minister they want,''
Rubinstein said on Israel Television. ``Is this not better than
asking some rabbi who is sitting in Brooklyn?''
   Herzog warned that the political maneuvering surrounding
formation of a coalition has raised ``piercing questions about our
system of government and our political culture.''
   Both Labor and Likud have openly offered political favors to
lure defectors from the opposite camp. The backroom deals have
sparked a grass-roots campaign for electoral reform to lessen the
power of minority parties. More than 90 percent of Israel's
population is not ultra-Orthodox.
   Also Wednesday, two Palestinians were killed in
inter-Palestinian violence and Israeli soldiers shot and wounded
seven others during protests in the occupied territories, the army
and Arab reports said.
   The army also said three Palestinians were injured when police
broke up a stone-throwing demonstration outside a high school in
east Jerusalem. Sources said one suffered a broken hand and the two
others were overcome by tear gas.
   The deaths brought to 206 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs in the 28-month uprising against Israeli occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza. Most have been slain as suspected
collaborators.
   At least 673 other Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers or civilians during the revolt, and 43 Israelis have been
killed.

   Angry farmers Wednesday forced
authorities to interrupt the slaughter of 150,000 pigs to combat
the swine plague. A government official urged the protesters to end
their demonstration.
   Agriculture Minister Paul De Keersmaeker issued a dramatic
appeal to pig farmers, saying that if such drastic sanitary
measures were not taken, the European Community would ban Belgian
pork exports.
   ``We cannot go back on our decision'' to order mass
slaughtering, De Keersmaeker said after consulting with Prime
Minister Wilfried Martens.
   The agriculture committees of the Belgian Senate and House of
Representatives plan to interrupt their Easter holidays for an
emergency meeting next week. De Keersmaeker will be questioned on
possible alternative measures, such as vaccination, to avoid mass
slaughters.
   Four mayors of pig farming villages asked the minister to
suspend the slaughter, claiming it would be a disaster for pig
farmers. The government then suspended the program Wednesday.
   ``The slaughter was made impossible,'' agriculture spokesman Jef
Verhaeren said, refusing to elaborate.
   Disgruntled farmers also continued to interrupt traffic in the
affected areas in northern Belgium, including the main
Brussels-Ostend highway, while several hundred demonstrated
silently in Brussels.
   On Tuesday, some 800 pigs from within a half-mile of areas where
swine plague was diagnosed since March 15 were destroyed at special
slaughtering installations.
   The swine plague is a fast-spreading, infectious disease that
causes pigs a painful death after a period ranging from one to
three weeks. It can cause vomiting, diarrhea and paralysis.

   For the fifth month in a row, Americans paid
more attention to foreign news than domestic news in March, the
Times Mirror Center for The People and The Press reported Wednesday.
   In its monthly survey of reader interest, the news industry
organization listed 18 news stories ranging from Lithuania's
declaration of independence to the NCAA basketball playoffs.
   It asked people which was the most important.
   Forty percent of those responding cited an international story,
with 21 percent naming Lithuanian independence. Also mentioned were
other political developments in the Soviet Union, East Germany and
elsewhere in Eastern and Central Europe. Two percent named the
release of black leader Nelson Mandela from a South African prison.
   Four percent mentioned domestic stories, including oil spills,
the basketball playoffs, the death of 87 people in a fire at a
social club in New York and the attempt in Idaho to pass a bill
that would severely restrict abortions.
   Ten percent named stories not on the list as the most important;
43 percent said they didn't know, and 2 percent refused to answer.
This adds up to only 99 percent because the percentages were
rounded to the nearest full number.
   The organization also asked questions about President Bush, and
said 74 percent of those responding replied that they approved of
the way he is handling his duties. Sixteen percent disapproved; the
rest refused to answer or said they didn't know.
   Sixty-four percent said they were optimistic that Bush would
make progress in solving the country's long-term problems.
   In response to more specific questions, 46 percent said he was
doing an ``only fair'' job in dealing with long-term economic
problems, 42 percent that he was doing only fair on long term
health care problems, 43 percent that he was doing only fair on
long-term education problems and 39 percent only fair on long-term
environmental problems.
   The percentages rating his performance good or poor were
smaller. Only 2 to 5 percent of those responding rated him
excellent in dealing with the various issues.
   People were also asked what vegetable it is that Bush recently
said he wouldn't eat. Seventy-six percent answered correctly that
it was broccoli. Four percent named some other vegetable and 20
percent didn't know or wouldn't answer.
   The survey results are based on telephone interviews conducted
under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates April
5-8. The survey covered 1,212 adults aged 18 or older. The Gallup
Organization did the interviewing. The results are subject to a
sampling error of 3 percentage points.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister-designate Lothar de Maiziere
finished forming his government Wednesday and reached an agreement
with political partners on East Germany's terms for unification
with West Germany.
   The agreement clears the way for Parliament to formally put de
Maiziere's government in office so it can begin talks with West
Germany on merging their nations.
   ``Now it is good,'' de Maiziere said after nearly a week of
coalition talks ended. His conservative alliance won a majority in
the country's first free election March 18.
   No details were immediately available on the coalition
agreement. But de Maiziere, whose Christian Democrats favor speedy
unification and a dramatic shift to capitalism, gave key
ministerial posts to Social Democrats who favor a slower
transition. Some concessions were likely.
   Many East Germans fear hard times when subsidies and other
aspects of the 4-decade-old Communist system are scrapped. A new
study said 1.5 million people in this country of 16 million could
be thrown out of work in five years unless unification brings a
spurt of growth.
   On Thursday, Parliament is expected to formally name de Maiziere
prime minister and install his 24-member Cabinet, and the policy
agreement is to be signed. Social Democrats were nominated to hold
seven of the portfolios, including party chief Markus Meckel as
foreign minister and Walter Romberg as finance minister.
   In Bonn, a West German government spokesman said Chancellor
Helmut Kohl wants to sign a treaty on monetary union between the
two states by May 6, with the currency merger to go into effect by
July 7.
   Kohl's spokesman, Dieter Vogel, said the chancellor wants talks
to begin as quickly as possible on the sensitive issue of
converting East German currency into West German marks.
   But de Maiziere said an East German timetable for unification
``was not yet fixed.''
   An increasingly restive work force worried about rampant
unemployment planned demonstrations to coincide with Thursday's
second session of the nation's first freely elected Parliament.
   A farmers organization said it would drive tractors and farm
implements through East Berlin to demand an orderly transition to
private ownership of property.
   Telephone and other electronics workers fearing unemployment
called a three-hour strike Thursday in East Berlin.
   While workers worry about their future, foreign businesses have
been flooding the East bloc to tap the new consumer market. The
East German government news agency ADN said 599 joint ventures have
been formed since the borders were opened in November. Another 400
are expected by the end of April.
   It said 60 percent of the enterprises are in the service and
tourism industry, and about 96 percent involve West German
companies.
   But East Germany would have to experience an 8.5 percent annual
growth rate to head off massive unemployment, according to a study
by the Institute for International Politics and Economics in East
Berlin.
   ADN quoted the agency as saying a 5 percent growth rate still
would result in up to 1.5 million jobless by 1995, and 2.6 million
by 2000.
   De Maiziere's coalition favors quickly enacted laws allowing
ownership of private property and private ownership of East
Germany's factories and enterprises.
   The Social Democrats want employees to be able to take part in
ownership of factories. They say East Germans will face higher
prices and many will lose their jobs as inefficent businesses and
enterprises are closed.
   A key point in the coalition talks was how much the virtually
worthless East German mark would be worth in a unified Germany.
   West Germany's central bank proposes exchanging most East German
marks at a 2-1 rate to West German marks. Savings accounts with
less than 2,000 marks, about $1,200, would be exchanged at a 1-1
rate.
   De Maiziere's designated economics minister, Gerhard Pohl, said
Tuesday that he favored a 30,000-mark ceiling on 1-1 conversions.
   De Maiziere's three-party coalition holds the most seats in the
new 400-member Parliament but needs a two-thirds majority to
rewrite the constitution to make a merger with West Germany
possible.
   The new government will eventually take part in talks with West
Germany and the four World War II allies _ the United States,
Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ on reunification.
   One of the biggest questions to be dealt with in those talks is
the military alliance of a united Germany. West Germany is
currently a member of NATO, but the Soviet Union has refused to
accept NATO membership for the new Germany.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has expressed
interest in dual NATO-Warsaw Pact membership for a united Germany,
according to an article to be published next month in ``NATO's
Sixteen Nations,'' an independent magazine that covers
international security issues.
   Reacting to the article, NATO spokesman Florent Swijsen said the
Western military alliance remains opposed to dual membership.

<HEAD>European Space Agency To Cooperate With Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Space Agency will sign a 10-year
agreement with the Soviet Union this month aimed at promoting
cooperation for the first time in space exploration, the agency
announced Wednesday.
   ``This is a very important step forward,'' said Reimar Luest,
the space agency's director-general. He said it would be beneficial
to both sides.
   Past cooperation has been based on an exchange of letters
between the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the European Space
Research Organization, one of the European Space Agency's
precursors. It has been concerned largely with exchange of
scientific information.
   The space activities to be covered by the new accord will
include exploration of the solar system, space astronomy and
astrophysics, earth observation, and other fields. Working groups
will be established to recommend joint projects, the 13-nation
space agency said.
   The agency said the agreement, to be reassessed after 10 years,
would not call for any exchange of funds. It described the accord
as ``a positive development in the course of relations between the
Soviet Union and Western Europe.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned in remarks
broadcast Wednesday that recarving internal Soviet borders would
lead to civil war and ``such bloody carnage that we won't be able
to crawl out of it.''
   He told members of the Communist Youth League he had spent more
time thinking about whether he should allow changes in the
country's political map than any other issue, and decided against
it.
   More than 100 ethnic groups inhabit the Soviet Union. Under
Gorbachev's democratizing reforms, many have begun to clamor for
lands that were historically theirs and for more freedom from
Moscow. Lithuania based its March 11 declaration of independence on
claims it was illegally annexed 50 years ago.
   Gorbachev said redrawing Soviet boundaries ``would pit all
peoples and all nations against each other and bring about a
situation in this society the likes of which has never been
witnessed by our country or by the world.''
   And if other republics follow Lithuania's example and try to
secede, he said, ``If we begin to divide up, I'll give it to you
bluntly. We'll end up in such a civil war, in such bloody carnage
that we won't be able to crawl out of it.''
   Gorbachev issued dire predictions about ethnic conflict before,
but his statements Tuesday at a question-and-answer session with a
congress of young Communists, broadcast by Soviet TV on Wednesday,
appeared pointed at Lithuania.
   The Kremlin has been locked in a confrontation with Lithuanian
leaders since they declared the Baltic republic's independence.
Gorbachev issued the latest in a series of harsh warnings to the
Lithuanians Monday, but Tuesday he backed off, saying he did not
see a need to impose presidential rule there yet.
   In the broadcast remarks, Gorbachev said he was sure residents
of Lithuania would vote against the republic's independence once
they understood the frightening array of problems it created.
   ``The Lithuanian people are a wise people,'' he said, and will
realize that Lithuania ``needs independence, but within the
framework'' of the Soviet Union.
   He spelled out the major problems facing the breakaway republic.
Territorial disputes with Byelorussia and over the port of Klaipeda
loom, some Soviet plants are cutting off their ties with Lithuanian
enterprises and many non-Lithuanian residents may need to be
resettled outside the republic.
   Gorbachev accused leaders of Sajudis, the movement that
spearheaded Lithuania's independence drive and now controls its
government, of trying to persuade ethnic activists in the Caucasus
region to create disturbances in their support.
   He said they appealed ``to certain circles in Azerbaijan and
Armenia saying `What are you sitting here for, light a fire, to
create a front against the center.'' Gorbachev added that the
``full weight of the law'' should be brought against ethnic
agitators.
   Lithuania's independence drive has remained non-violent, but
ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus region and Central Asia have left
hundreds of victims the last two years.
   Gorbachev, who spoke in a warm, somewhat fatherly tone to the
Komsomol members, also touched on an impending split in the
country's Communist Party.
   A toughly worded statement by the party's Central Committee,
issued Tuesday and printed in Wednesday's Pravda, accused leading
radicals of trying to split the entire party nationwide and
indicated they could be expelled.
   It was aimed at the Democratic Platform, a union of party
members demanding faster and more radical reforms than Gorbachev
seeks.
   Gorbachev said the statement ``was not a call for a schism, nor
for attacking a fraction, or people who think differently, but
rather a call for consolidation.''
   A leader of the Democratic Platform, Vyacheslav Shostakovski,
said Wednesday he believed some members of the group would defect
and form a totally new party.
   He told Interfax, a news service affiliated with Radio Moscow,
that the Democratic Platform would fashion a public response and
would also appeal for support to the party Congress, formally the
party's highest body, when it meets this July.

   CBS, which this week axed its late-night ``The
Pat Sajak Show,'' said Thursday it will replace the show with
repeats of its ``Wiseguy'' series and two reruns of Fox
Broadcasting's ``21 Jump Street'' through June 1.
   Sajak was on vacation when his low-rated talk show was
cancelled. The guest host of its final broadcast on Friday will be
Pul Rodriguez, whose ``Grand Slam'' series was cancelled by CBS
earlier this year.
   Starting Monday, ``Wiseguy'' repeats will be shown in Sajak's
former time period, although the slot will be filled Friday by a
pre-Earth Day special, ``Save The Planet: A CBS@Hard Rock Cafe
Special.''
   After that, ``Wiseguy'' reruns will return, except for May 11
and June 1, when ``21 Jump Street'' repeats will be shown, CBS said.
   The network said it is working on original late-night
programming for next fall.

<HEAD>Army to Temporarily Abandon Shooting Goats for Medical Training</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army will no longer shoot goats to train
physicians at Fort Sam Houston to treat gunshot wounds, a
physicians group that sought the moratorium said Wednesday.
   The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine said 800 to
1,000 goats were being shot each year at the San Antonio, Texas,
base.
   The practice continues at Fort Bragg, N.C., and as many as 1,200
goats are involved, the committee said.
   Dr. Neal D. Barnard, a psychiatrist and president of the
organization, said the group sought in moratorium after specialists
such as radiologists and psychiatrists, who normally don't treat
trauma victims, were told to participate in the Fort Sam Houston
training.
   ``It's not a very nice thing to be shooting these animals.
Secondly, it's not even very good training,'' Barnard said.
   The wound of a goat is far different from a human wound, he
said. Shooting a goat in the leg ``has no relation to an abdominal
wound or a chest wound or a head wound. ... The tissue feels
different in the goat _ it's got thick, hairy skin.''
   Barnard said the Army had been shooting goats to train doctors
since 1958.
   Pat Davis, chief of public affairs for the Army's Academy of
Health Sciences at Fort Sam Houston, said she couldn't confirm how
long the shootings had been taking place. The ban took effect about
90 days ago.
   The physicians group, she said, was inaccurate in saying the
goats were being shot. The Army uses a ``firing mechanism,'' which
she described as a small square box, to fire a ``projectile,'' or
metal pellet, into a goat's leg.
   The military had been using the pellets to simulate the
``shocking impact'' of firing at a human from a military weapon.
Military weapons fire projectiles at a far higher speed than
handguns, she said.
   Military weapons cause ``a great deal of destruction to the
tissue,'' she said. If military physicians don't clean the wound
correctly, ``the guy will lose his limb and probably his life.''
   Barnard said the Army's decision was only temporary and that his
organization would push for a permanent ban, along with a ban at
Fort Bragg.
   Ms. Davis said she was not sure whether the ban was permanent or
temporary. Goats will still be used for other surgical procedures,
she said.

<HEAD>Kurt Masur Named NY Philharmonic Music Director</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kurt Masur, who for 20 years has led the
Gewandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig, East Germany, was named Wednesday
as the New York Philharmonic's music director.
   Masur, 62, will replace Zubin Mehta, who told the Philharmonic
in November 1988 that he would leave as music director after the
1990-91 season.
   Masur's appointment is for five years and begins in the 1992-93
season, the Philharmonic's 150th anniversary season. He will
conduct for 14 weeks that season and spend four weeks here in other
activities.
   Stephen Stamas, chairman of the New York Philharmonic Society,
announced the appointment on a day when Masur was in Paris.
   Stamas said in a news conference that Masur will be ``music
director designate'' in the 1991-92 season. He will conduct two
weeks that season, which has been set for some time.
   ``We were aware he is a leader of the New Forum and hero of the
revolution (in East Germany) and had non-musical interests that
might have made it difficult for us to attract him to New York,''
Stamas said.
   ``He is still very active with the New Forum, which has decided
not to become a political party. I believe he'll maintain a healthy
interest in what is going on in Germany, while his interests will
be largely musical.''
   Masur was born July 18, 1927, in Brieg, Silesia, now in Poland.
He studied at the music college of Leipzig. From 1960 to 1964 he
was senior director of music at Berlin's Komische Oper and from
1967 to 1972 was chief conductor of the Dresden Philharmonic.
   Stamas said that Masur will remain principal conductor of the
Gewandhaus Orchestra through the 1993-94 season, its 250th
anniversary, and will maintain some association there. He first
conducted the New York Philarharmonic in June 1981 and has
conducted 22 concerts here, most recently in January 1989.
   Stamas said that conductors Colin Davis and Leonard Bernstein
will give the New York Philharmonic more than their usual amounts
of time during the changeover of music directors.
   For the first time, a six-musician committee from the
Philharmonic took part in the selection. Oboist Joseph Robinson
said that three of them flew to Paris and talked to Masur on
Monday, flying back for Tuesday night's concert here and that the
final decision was made after that.
   Masur is married to soprano Tomoko Sakurai. They have a
12-year-old son. Masur also has four children from previous
marriages.
   Other candidates for the New York Philharmonic included Claudio
Abbado, who was near signing with the orchestra when he was engaged
to replace the late Herbert von Karajan with the Berlin
Philharmonic.
   Rumors that Leonard Slatkin would be named did not stop even
after his re-signing with the St. Louis Symphony.

   Constantine Mitsotakis was sworn in as
premier Wednesday, ending 10 months of political deadlock to cap
his conservative party's comeback nine years after being defeated
by the socialists of Andreas Papandreou.
   The new government leader immediately pledged four years of
stable leadership. His New Democracy party won elections Sunday
after two inconclusive polls in June and November.
   Shortly after the new 38-member Cabinet was sworn in by Greek
Orthodox Archbishop Seraphim at the presidential mansion, the
fledgling administration received the blessing of the nation's
elder statesman, six-time premier and former President Constantine
Karamanlis.
   After the 45-minute meeting at Karamanlis' home, Mitsotakis said
the 83-year-old elder stateman had accepted a proposal to run for
president. Karamanlis, who introduced the institution of the
presidency in 1974, relinquished his bid for re-election in 1985
when the governing socialists reneged on a promise to back his
candidacy.
   Karamanlis is almost certain to gain the 151 votes in Parliament
needed for his election.
   New Democracy won 150 seats in the 300-member Parliament in
Sunday's elections. On Monday, it gained the support of the lone
deputy elected on the right-wing Democratic Renewal party ticket,
giving it a majority.
   ``This government can and will accomplish much substantially,
and we are determined to accomplish this with a four-year term in
mind,'' Mitsotakis said after his Cabinet's first meeting.
   One unusual name in the new Cabinet list was composer Mikis
Theodorakis, who gained fame in 1963 with his score for the
award-winning film ``Zorba the Greek.'' He was appointed minister
without portfolio.
   New Democracy returns to power after losing to Papandreou's
Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, in a landslide in 1981
during a wave of anti-Americanism.
   Mitsotakis has promised to improve relations with the United
States, which has four military bases in Greece. He also has said
he would be willing to extradite to the United States a Palestinian
suspected of involvement in the bombing of an American passenger
jet in 1982.
   Previous governments were ambivalent about the bases and stalled
on extraditing the suspect.
   The new conservative government faces a $15.6 billion budget
deficit and an inflation rate that reached 17.8 percent last month
_ more than triple the European Community average.
   The government plans to improve the economy by slashing state
spending, streamlining the huge public sector, and encouraging
private investment.
   Mitsotakis has asked President Christos Sartzetakis to speed up
the opening of Parliament, scheduled for April 23, so the
government can present its programs and seek a vote of confidence
next week.
   After the June elections, a governing New Democracy-Communist
alliance indicted Papandreou and senior socialists on corruption
charges but failed to tackle pressing economic and foreign policy
issues. No trial dates have been set.
   The worsening economy prompted the conservatives, Communists and
socialists to join in a three-party administration after another
inconclusive election in November. But this alliance was also
short-lived and ineffective.
   ``Without a doubt, our parliamentary majority is slim,''
Mitsotakis said Wednesday. ``But there is also the margin given to
us by the broader spectrum of our people: the tolerance and the
hope that it has stored in us.''

<HEAD>Workers Dispute Report That They Are Exposed to Most Radiation in

   A report that called the Oyster Creek
Nuclear Generating Station the nation's worst plant for protecting
workers from radiation has come under heavy criticism from the
employees themselves.
   ``My friends make a lot of jokes about me glowing in the dark,''
said Margaret Martin, a radiological control worker who has worked
at the plant since 1988. ``That's just lack of education.''
   A study released Tuesday by Public Citizen, a Washington-based
organization founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, said there
were 2,875 incidents of worker exposure at Oyster Creek in 1988.
   The figure is double the plant's 1987 exposure mark and triple
the 1988 average of the nation's other 106 commercial nuclear power
plants, according to the report, ``Glowing on The Job.''
   Gleaned from Nuclear Regulatory Commission documents, the report
also said Oyster Creek, the nation's oldest commercial plant still
in operation, had the second-highest number incidents of worker
exposure from 1980 to 1988 among 20 plants considered the nation's
worst. Oyster Creek's 20,486 cases of worker exposure trailed only
the 27,701 recorded at Pilgrim 1 in Plymouth, Mass.
   At the end of work Tuesday, many of Oyster Creek's 990 workers
said they were aware of the risks of working at a nuclear plant,
but do not believe they are in any greater danger than their
counterparts nationwide.
   ``They brainwash you to make it sound like it's dangerous,''
said Jeff Manning, who has worked at Oyster Creek for three months.
   ``This place doesn't bother me a bit,'' said Roger Mengle, a
Waretown man who has handled hazardous materials at the plant since
June. Before that, he worked for eight years at Three Mile Island
in Middletown, Pa., which was the site of the nation's worst
commerical nuclear accident.
   ``This is my job,'' Mengle said.
   Some Oyster Creek workers said they chose to work in the nuclear
industry because of the high pay.
   ``There's better money to be made here,'' said Martin.
   Oyster Creek spokesman Sandy Polon said he would not divulge the
range of salaries at the plant.
   Karl Neddenien, another plant spokesman, said the report was
``needlessly alarming.''
   Neddenien did not dispute findings that each worker was exposed
to an average dose of radiation equivalent to 26 chest X-rays, but
argued that non-plant workers in Ocean County receive naturally
occurring background radiation that is more than 40 percent of that
figure.
   Neddenien said that although Oyster Creek, which began producing
electricity in 1969, had more exposures than the nation's other
commerical nuclear plants, the level was well within federal
standards for total exposure.
   Neddenien also said the station's older design required more
employees to work in a more compact area, exposing them more
frequently.
   ``Working in a nuclear power plant entails possible exposure to
radiation,'' Neddenien said. ``It's certainly not a surprise.''
   He said officials are trying to reduce the number of worker
exposures by installing permanent scaffolding inside the plant's
dry well to prevent workers from spending extra time setting it up
before repairs. He also said more radiation shielding is being
installed.
   Harry Sharma of Toms River, a nuclear engineer for nine years,
said the exposure to radiation was relative.
   ``If you fly on a plane, you get radiation. It doesn't mean you
don't fly. We're still within the limits and the limits are
artifically low,'' he said.
   Oyster Creek is a subsidiary of General Public Utilities Corp.
of Parsippany. It is operated by GPU Nuclear Corp. and owned by
Jersey Central Power &amp; Light, which gets power from Oyster Creek
for about 200,000 of its 800,000 customers.

   A federal judge on Wednesday gave former
national security adviser John Poindexter, convicted of five felony
counts in the Iran-Contra scandal, an extra week to file motions
for a new trial.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene approved the extension until
April 24 sought Tuesday by the office of Poindexter's attorney,
Richard W. Beckler.
   The office of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, which has
been investigating the Iran-Contra scandal since December 1986,
filed court papers Wednesday saying it did not oppose the extension.
   Beckler's motion requested the extra time to file motions for a
directed verdict of acquittal and for a new trial, both of which
would require the judge to set aside last Saturday's jury verdict.
   Frederick Robinson, an attorney with Beckler's office who signed
the request for the extra time, said the motions will not be based
on new evidence, but he declined to say what arguments will be made.
   ``Those are things we're working out now,'' he said. ``I'm not
at liberty to get into all the grounds yet.''
   The deadline for such motions without an extension would have
been April 17, he said.
   Poindexter, 53, was convicted Saturday of conspiracy,
obstruction and lying to Congress. He could face up to 25 years in
prison and $1.25 million in fines when he is sentenced June 11.
   Beckler said immediately after the conviction that he planned to
appeal.
   ``We're naturally disappointed with the verdict in this case,
but we're going to appeal it and we're going to keep fighting it as
hard as we can,'' Beckler said at the time.
   Poindexter was the third top Reagan administration figure
convicted in the scandal. The others, former Poindexter aide Oliver
North and former national security adviser Robert McFarlane, have
not served any jail time.
   Poindexter was convicted of conspiring with North, businessman
Richard Secord and others to conceal the truth about the
Iran-Contra affair from Congress.
   Specifically, Poindexter was accused of covering up North's
secret Contra resupply network and the U.S. role in a CIA-assisted
shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran in November 1985.
   North's Contra military assistance operation occurred during a
congressional ban that required the CIA to withdraw military
support for the rebels fighting the Sandinista government in
Nicaragua.

   The 1976 murder of former Chilean diplomat
Orlando Letelier on a tree-lined traffic circle in Washington
touched off a furor that strained U.S.-Chilean relations and sent
two men to prison.
   A third man was arrested Wednesday by the FBI in St. Petersburg,
Fla.
   Jose Dionisio Suarez y Esquivel, 51, was charged with conspiracy
to murder a foreign official. The FBI said Suarez provided the
explosives and detonating devices for the bomb that killed Letelier.
   In federal court in Tampa, Suarez waived his right to a bond
hearing and was ordered detained while he awaits trial in
Washington. Suarez faces life in prison if convicted.
   Letelier, who had criticized human rights policies of the
Chilean military government that exiled him, died Sept. 21, 1976,
when the bomb under his car exploded as he drove to work along
Washington's Embassy Row.
   Ronni Moffitt, a Letelier associate at a Washington-based think
tank, also was killed. Her husband, Michael, was injured.
   Michael V. Townley, a U.S. citizen employed by the Chilean
intelligence agency, was arrested in April 1978. Townley was
extradited to the United States, confessed to planting the bomb on
the order of superiors and was sentenced to 40 months in prison.
   A former Chilean Secret Service officer, Maj. Armando Fernandez
Larios, was sentenced in May 1987 to between 27 months and seven
years after pleading guilty to being an accessory to the
assassination.
   Immediately after the bombing, U.S. legislators and Letelier
associates charged that he was murdered by agents of the Chilean
government. Friends said Letelier had told them of repeated death
threats.
   Resolutions were introduced in Congress calling for an
investigation and protest demonstrations were held outside the
Chilean Embassy.
   The embassy denied any government involvement.
   Letelier had been foreign minister in the cabinet of the late
President Salvador Allende when Allende was overthrown by the armed
forces in 1973. He had been ambassador to the United States from
1971 until earlier in 1973.
   He was arrested and held until September 1974, when he was
released exiled. Letelier lived briefly in Venezuela, then moved to
Washington and joined the Institute for Policy Studies, a privately
financed study group.
   Initially, he was silent on Chilean affairs. In the months
before his death, however, he denounced the military junta's
alleged use of torture and other rights violations.
   On Sept. 10, just 11 days before the bombing, the junta revoked
Letelier's Chilean citizenship.
   ``I was born a Chilean, I am a Chilean, and I will die a
Chilean,'' Letelier said in response.
   In pleading guilty to the accessory charge in 1987, Fernandez
said he gave a map and surveillance notes to Townley.
   A federal court in Washington also indicted two other Chilean
Secret Service officers, Gen. Manuel Contreras Sepulveda and Col.
Pedro Espinoza Bravo, in connection with the assassination. The
Chilean Supreme Court refused to extradite them, saying the
evidence was insufficient.
   The Chilean government ordered its own investigation, headed by
Gen. Hector Orozco Sepulveda. In 1987, Orozco was implicated by a
former Chilean army major in a cover-up of Chile's role in the
killing. The Justice Department sought to question him, but the
Chilean Supreme Court said he could not be questioned about any
official activities related to his role as military prosecutor in
the probe.
   In January 1989, however, the Supreme Court in Santiago approved
a U.S. request to question seven other former officials of the
military government.
   On March 11, an elected civilian government took power in Chile,
ending 16{ years of the right-wing military rule of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a leading critic of the
Pinochet regime, said he expected the new democratic government to
allow prosecution of Contreras and Espinoza.
   Espinoza headed the Chilean National Intelligence Agency, while
Contreras was the agency's operations director.

<HEAD>Bush Spurns New Appeal to Recognize Lithuania as Independent

   President Bush spurned appeals from
Baltic-American leaders Wednesday to recognize the renegade
government in Lithuania. He declared support for its struggle for
independence but voiced concern about the impact on the Soviet
Union.
   ``Our policy, we believe, is the correct one and it does not
involve recognition,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   Anthony Mazeika, director of the Baltic American Freedom League,
said, ``We are disappointed with the official policy of the United
States'' not to recognize the government of Lithuanian President
Vytautas Landsbergis.
   Mazeika had urged Bush to extend ``de facto'' recognition of
Landsbergis' government, one step short of formal recognition.
   Bush met for more than an hour with 13 Baltic-Americans
representing the interests of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, which
were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Members of the group said they had been seeking a meeting with
Bush since January, recognizing that a crisis was looming in
Lithuania's drive to secede from the Soviet Union and Moscow's
refusal to let it go.
   ``We have a lot of very good contacts on the lower- and
mid-levels of the State Department. It's just the White House we
haven't been able to penetrate,'' said Mari-Ann Rikken of the
Estonian-American National Council. ``We used to wear out the
threshold of the previous administration.''
   Yet, members of the group said the mere fact that Bush met with
them will be seen in the Baltic states as a positive step.
   Ms. Rikken said, ``Mr. Bush had a failure with China. He does
not want to see a similar kind of thing happen in the Baltic states.
   ``He's very concerned,'' she added. ``He wants to find a way
out, a way out of the Soviet Union for the Baltic states that will
not result in a cataclysm for the Soviet Union and that will not
result in a blood bath for the Baltic states.''
   Fitzwater said Bush told the group ``the U.S. must avoid taking
actions that would inadvertently make Lithuania's task more
difficult by inflaming the situation'' and stressed the importance
of quiet diplomacy.
   Bush said he did not want to see a situation akin to 1956 when
the United States encouraged Hungary's revolt for democracy but
then stood by helplessly as the Soviet Union crushed the uprising
with force, Fitzwater said.
   Ms. Rikken said Bush was ``very, very worried about what
happened in Hungary'' and that ``he kept bringing this up during
the meeting.''
   She said, ``Our job is to convince him that letting the Baltic
states go could be the best thing that would happen to the Soviet
Union.''
   Fitzwater said, ``We believe that our present position is the
correct one and the president did not indicate that we were willing
to change our position.''
   The meeting fell one month after Lithuania's March 11
declaration of independence.
   Since then, the administration has been walking a narrow
diplomatic line, endorsing Lithuania's aspirations for
self-determination but refusing to recognize the new government.
   While emphasizing that the United States never recognized the
Soviet takeover of the Baltic states, the administration argues
that Lithuania does not control its own territory.
   Lithuania's determination to secede has posed a major challenge
to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is struggling on
other fronts to carry out his programs of economic and political
reforms, known as perestroika, and openness, known as glasnost.
   While admonishing Moscow not to use force in Lithuania, Bush
credits Gorbachev as a driving force behind the democratic reforms
in Eastern Europe and changes within the Soviet Union.
   Fitzwater said Bush, in meeting with the Baltic-Americans,
``pointed out in forceful terms that the United States approaches
this problem with many ramifications to consider.
   ``He did say that we support glasnost and perestroika,''
Fitzwater said. ``He pointed out that we have had these dramatic
changes in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland. And, indeed, we have
the atmosphere whereby Lithuania could consider its future in a
different light because of glasnost and perestroika.''
   Fitzwater said Bush shared the concerns of the Baltic-Americans
and reiterated his support for the right of the Baltic states to
self-determination.
   Bush was joined by Secretary of State James A. Baker III; White
House chief of staff John Sununu; Brent Scowcroft, the national
security adviser, and others.
   ``The problems that are taking place in Lithuania are going to
multiply threefold,'' said Ojars Kalnins of the American Latvian
Association.
   ``The Latvians will be declaring independence in two weeks,'' he
said. ``Estonia is in the same process.'' He said that by the time
Bush meets with Gorbachev on May 30, ``We will have a situation in
all three republics which is comparable to what is happening
today'' in Lithuania.

   A woman testified Wednesday she hit a man with
a hatchet to protect herself from being sexually attacked and
denied she tried to kill him to bring ``Jack the Ripper'' back to
life.
   Deborah Kazuck, 27, took the stand in her trial on a charge of
attempted first-degree intentional homicide. She has pleaded
innocent and innocent by reason of mental disease or defect. The
case went to the jury Wednesday afternoon.
   Two co-defendants pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against
Ms. Kazuck, of Milwaukee.
   Ms. Kazuck said she met Jeffrey Meka a few days before he was
struck with the hatchet. She said they visited his apartment and
discussed their mutual interest in Jack the Ripper.
   She said she hit him with the hatchet on May 29 at her apartment
to fend off an intended sexual assault.
   Ms. Kazuck said she regularly carried a backpack containing a
hatchet, a drill and knives.
   Ramona Barry, 27, and Catherine Lipsham, 23, who have pleaded
guilty, testified the three had planned to ``kack'' Meka.
   Ms. Barry and Ms. Lipsham testified Tuesday that the word
``kacking'' was was their code word for killing.
   Ms. Kazuck said the word was part of a code she devised and
meant ``catch the thief'' who had robbed her apartment.
   Ms. Kazuck said she carried weapons ``for protection against the
thief.'' She said she didn't intend to hurt anybody but ``if
somebody would harm me, I would have to use it.''
   The prosecutor told the jury in his opening arguments that Ms.
Kazuck planned to dismember Meka's body, drain his blood and eat
his kidneys in a ritual she believed would bring Jack the Ripper,
the 19th century English serial killer, back to life.
   Assistant District Attorney Mark Williams said Ms. Kazuck
plotted the assault with the help of Ms. Barry and Ms. Lipsham.
   The two pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree intentional
homicide Friday and agreed to testify against Ms. Kazuck in
exchange for the prosecution's promise to seek no more than eight
years in prison for each.
   Both women testified they went out with Ms. Kazuck several times
looking for people to ``kack,'' but assaulted no one.
   Defense attorney Alan Olshan described his client as a ``young,
nervous and immature girl with childish ideas.''
   Meka, 27, whose head wound required 50 stitches, testified
Tuesday he was attacked when he went to the bathroom after being
invited to a woman's South Side apartment.
   ``I opened up the shower curtain. I saw four feet. As I was
looking up, I heard a scream and a child's voice: `Redrum. Redrum.'
As I was looking up, `boom' I was hit,'' he said.
   Redrum is the word murder spelled backwards.

<HEAD>World Media Group Meets with Gorbachev</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Participants in the World Media Conference met
with Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday and heard the Soviet
president's latest assessment of how the Kremlin's reforms were
progressing.
   Gorbachev told the delegation that Soviet society ``is leaving
the rallying stage and is becoming involved in real deeds,'' the
Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   ``Availing ourselves of these sentiments, we want to radicalize
the process of reforms,'' Tass quoted him as saying.
   Gorbachev is to meet Saturday with his major advisory bodies to
make final decisions on the program of radical economic reform he
has been promising since becoming president with greatly expanded
powers last month.
   The World Media Conference, meeting for the first time in
Moscow, gathered for a three-day symposium on Tuesday to discuss
the impact of political change in the Soviet Union on global
communications.
   About 500 delegates from 60 countries, including more than 40
former heads of state, attended the opening of the association
founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon to encourage East-West
communication in politics, economics and the environment.
   Gorbachev told conference participants Wednesday that ``we are
only at the beginning of the process of shaping a new world
order,'' Tass said.
   He called the media conference a ``very important element of
cooperation,'' the agency said.
   Much of Wednesday's discussions focused on ecology.
   Two of the Soviet Union's best known environmental figures
spoke: Nikolai Vorontsov, chief of the government's committee on
the environment, and Alexei Yablokov, a prominent ecologist who has
helped publicize frightening facts about pollution in the Soviet
Union.
   Yablokov proposed a program of urgent ecological measures to
help coordinate environmental laws around the world and require
each country to preserve endangered species, Tass reported.
   Moon said in his opening remarks Tuesday that it was perestroika
that made it possible for the association to hold its meeting in
the Soviet capital.
   ``I feel there is no place more appropriate to gather for these
discussions than right here in the Soviet Union,'' Moon said.

<HEAD>Three Surinamese Arrested in Killing of Soviet Diplomat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Surinamese men were arrested
Wednesday in connection with the slaying of a Soviet diplomat
during an apparent robbery, police said.
   The three were captured in the western district of Nickerie,
which borders the neighboring South American nation of Guyana,
while trying to sell the diplomat's car, said police Inspector
Ronald Gayadhar.
   Stasis Obukauskas, 41, consul and second secretary in the Soviet
Embassy, had left home Monday night in the car, a station wagon
with diplomatic plates, police said.
   His body, with three bullet wounds in the head, was found
Tuesday in a gutter along Kennedy Highway, the main road between
Paramaribo and the capital's Zanderij International Airport.
   Gayadar said the three men confessed to the killing. He said one
of them was carrying a revolver, but it was not known whether
police thought the weapon was used in the slaying.
   He said police had ruled out a political motive for the killing
but circumstances remained unclear.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said Obukauskas had been traveling
to the airport to pick up another diplomat when a blue taxi
overtook his vehicle, blocked the road and forced him to stop.
   The dispatch from Washington quoted the embassy's first
secretary, A.I. Kavalerov, as saying the attackers shot Obukauskas,
``threw his body into the ditch and drove the car away.''
   Kavalerov was quoted as saying that two similar crimes had been
committed recently in the area. He said it was the first slaying of
a diplomat in the former Dutch colony since it achieved
independence in 1975.
   The three men arrested, all Surinamese citizens, were being held
Wednesday in an undisclosed police station pending formal charges.
   They were not identified.

   Liberian rebels freed a kidnapped
British journalist on Wednesday and returned him to this
neighboring West African nation.
   Mark Huband, a correspondent for United Press International and
the London Financial Times, was taken hostage Friday by the
guerrillas, who seek to overthrow Liberian President Samuel Doe.
   He was seized during an ambush of a freight train that he was
riding on in Liberia's eastern Nimba County, where the insurgents
invaded in December.
   Speaking from his home in Abidjan, Huband said the insurgents
contacted British Embassy officials and arranged for them to meet
him at the Ivorian-Liberian border on Wednesday.
   Huband said he had not been mistreated during the four days with
the guerrillas in Nimba County.

<HEAD>Poland Formally Votes to End Censorship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's lawmakers Wednesday formally
ended censorship, one of the final relics of four decades of
Communist rule.
   The decision by a 266-0 vote, with eight abstentions, was
largely symbolic. Censorship has been almost non-existent since the
Solidarity-led government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki was
voted in to power last fall.
   Solidarity deputy Juliusz Braun said censorship had actually
``allowed slandering with impunity'' without permitting a person to
defend himself.
   The censorship law allowed the former Communist authorities to
control all kinds of publications and stage and film performances,
preventing criticism of the political system.
   Many Poles turned to underground printing, which flourished
through the 1980s.
   Solidarity, the East bloc's first independent trade union,
fought for elimination of censorship since its foundation in 1980.

   Snow was scattered Wednesday from the northern Rockies across
the upper Midwest and Great Lakes to New England, where up to a
foot of snow accumulated.
   Light snow showers remained over northern Maine during the
afternoon following a storm that left 12 inches of snow at Telos
Lake, 9 inches at Grand Lake Matagamon, 8 inches at Clayton Lake
and 7 inches at Limestone.
   Snowshowers also were scattered over north-central Wyoming,
south-central Montana, west-central Minnesota, central Iowa,
northern Illinois, eastern Wisconsin, much of Michigan, northern
Indiana, from south-central Pennsylvania across eastern West
Virginia, and over northeastern New York state.
   Rain fell along the northern Pacific Coast, as well as over
southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina.
   The heaviest rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was
1.68 inches at Cape Hatteras, N.C.
   Authorities said Wednesday severe thunderstorms that rumbled
through Georgia late Tuesday had caused nearly $150,000 in damage
in Troup County, where 14 buildings were hit by trees and other
debris.
   No injuries were reported from the storms, but Hartsfield
Atlanta International Airport was closed for about an hour and
about 10,000 Georgia Power Co. customers in the Atlanta area lost
power for a short time.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 24 at
Marquette, Mich., to 95 at Palm Springs, Calif.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 9 at Valentine, Neb.

<HEAD>Jaruzelski Arrives in Soviet Union, Hints at Talks on Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski arrived in
the Soviet Union on Wednesday and hinted talks would be held on a
World War II massacre of Poles that still clouds relations between
the two countries.
   Jaruzelski said discussions during his four-day official visit
will focus partly on ``revealing painful pages in our common
history.'' He appeared to be referring to the Katyn forest massacre
of thousands of Polish officers during World War II.
   Moscow has long denied any Soviet role in the mass executions,
but there have been recent indications officials might finally
confirm Western historians' claims that Soviet secret police were
to blame.
   Before his departure from Warsaw, Jaruzelski told the Polish
news agency PAP he also expected his talks with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to address changes in Eastern Europe, German
unification and the status of Soviet troops in Poland.
   Jaruzelski arrived Wednesday in the Ukrainian city of Lvov and
then traveled to the republic capital of Kiev.
   The visit comes after the weekly Moscow News, in its March 25
edition, shed light from official Soviet records on the Katyn
incident, one of the last grisly deeds of the Stalin era to be
touched by Gorbachev's policy of glasnost.
   It published a two-page spread refuting claims that it was Nazi
invaders who killed the cream of the Polish intelligentsia held
prisoner just south of the western city Smolensk. Other articles
have called for the truth about Katyn, but none went so far as to
document the Soviet role in what has become the most painful World
War II incident for Poles.
   Most estimates say about 4,000 people died at Katyn.
   Hitler's army invaded western Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, starting
World War II. Weeks later, the Red Army marched into eastern Poland
and remained there until the Germans pushed them out in 1941.
   Katyn has remained a source of lingering Polish mistrust of the
Soviet Union. A joint Polish-Soviet commission has investigated the
massacre, but it never came to a final conclusion.

   When a 23-1 longshot called Landing
Officer burst out of thick fog and across the finish line at Delta
Downs, spectators and track officials knew right away the horse had
finished too fast and too far ahead.
   It had. On Wednesday, Jockey Sylvester Carmouche was banned from
racing in Louisiana for 10 years, accused of taking a fog-shrouded
short cut to win the race.
   ``As my mother use to say. I don't know how you spilled the
milk, I just know you spilled it,'' state Racing Commission member
Jeffrey Kallenberg said as he made the motion to suspend Carmouche.
   The jockey was accused of slipping Landing Officer out of the
race near the start on Jan. 11, waiting until the rest of the
horses rounded the track and slipping back in ahead of the pack
near the final turn.
   The horse, which had a record of only five wins in 53 races, won
by 24 lengths and 1.2 seconds off the track record in the mile-long
race.
   ``It ain't right. I know I ain't did it. I leave it up to my
lawyers what to do,'' Carmouche said after the commission's 7-1
vote.
   Carmouche's lawyer, Kent Schaffer, said he would appeal to a
state judge and ask for a stay that would allow the jockey to keep
racing pending a decision.
   Carmouche also had declared his innocence after the race, but
track stewards stripped him of his victory and suspended him from
racing at Delta Downs for two months.
   Wednesday's hearing was a continuation of a hearing held a month
ago to determine whether any more action was to be taken against
him.
   In testimony prior to the vote, Carmouche insisted that he
completed the race.
   But commission chairman Harold Thomas noted that two jockeys in
the race said no horse passed them at any time.
   ``They never noticed me,'' Carmouche replied.
   Commission member Jeffrey Kallenberg said the panel saw a
videotape of the race. Fog obscured details but Kallenberg said
that at no time could Carmouche's colors or the number ``8'' on his
horse be seen.
   ``How can that be that we did not see you?'' asked Kallenberg.
   ``I don't know, but I know I rode the whole race. The camera
must have missed my horse,'' said Carmouche.
   Track employee J.L. Vincent, assigned to count horses at various
points along the route, told commissioners he saw only eight of the
nine entries pass under the bright lights at the first turn.
   ``I thought maybe one horse had stayed in the starting gate,''
he said.
   At the final turn, however, he saw all nine horses, including
No. 8, Landing Officer.
   ``The No. 8 horse was ahead and running so fast he looked more
like a quarter horse,'' said Vincent, referring to a breed that
runs faster over shorter distances.
   At last month's hearing, Delta Downs veterinarian James
Broussard testified that Landing Officer wasn't breathing heavily
after the race and that the horse's leg wrappings were clean.
   ``In my opinion he didn't appear to have participated in a mile
race,'' Broussard said Wednesday under cross examination from
Carmouche's defense attorney.

<HEAD>Government Says Potatoes Safe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers shouldn't stop buying potatoes
because unusually high levels of a pesticide were found on a small
number of potatoes in a single field, the government said Wednesday.
   A major manufacturer of the aldicarb, Rhone-Poulenc AG Co., said
earlier this week it was stopping the sale of the pesticide for use
on potatoes until it can determine why residue levels were
unusually high.
   The residue levels on a sample of 10 potatoes among about 300
tested from 26 fields reportedly were nine times the levels allowed
by the Environmental Protection Agency. All 10 potatoes were from a
single field.
   The EPA commended the company for voluntarily halting sale of
the chemical for use on potatoes.
   ``Consumers should not be alarmed and they should continue their
normal consumption of potatoes,'' said the EPA, adding that the
advice was endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration and the
Agriculture Department.
   Aldicarb, a toxic chemical that causes flu-like symptoms
including nausea, headaches and dizziness, is used on a broad range
of fruits and vegetables to control insects, mites and nematodes.
   The chemical has been under review at the EPA for some time for
its affect on groundwater, and agency officials are considering
whether to examine possible concerns about residues on food
products.
   ``While we believe the continued use of aldicarb is safe, we
have a responsibility to the public to conduct additional research
... to determine the reasons for the unexplained residue levels,''
Rhone-Poulenc said in a statement.
   Aldicarb has been used since 1970 on such crops as potatoes,
citrus fruits, soybeans, peanuts and cotton.
   Katherine Karr of the National Coalition Against the Misuse of
Pesticides said the reports from Rhone-Poulenc demonstrate the need
for additional goverment action on the chemical.
   ``The EPA should suspend the use of aldicarb until they can
determine what risk levels there are out there for the food
supply,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Mario Vargas Llosa has postponed a decision on
whether to drop out of a runoff election for president following a
disappointing showing in the first round, associates said Wednesday.
   The celebrated novelist, who put aside his writing two years ago
to campaign, was a strong favorite until a week ago to become
president of this Andean nation.
   Associates, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
Wednesday that the writer has considered stepping aside to allow
Alberto Fujimori, the runner-up in elections Sunday, to become
president-elect.
   They said he wanted to save Peru, suffering from growing rebel
violence and severe economic problems, from two more turbulent
months of political campaigning.
   Vargas Llosa's advisers said he would announce his decision
Monday. Until then, he is spending the Easter holidays in seclusion
at a friend's beach home 30 miles south of Lima.
   Manuel d'Ornellas, editor of Expreso newspaper and a close
friend of the novelist, confirmed in a column Wednesday that Vargas
Llosa had been planning to announce his resignation Tuesday
afternoon but was pursuaded by advisers to put off a decision until
Monday.
   D'Ornellas said Vargas Llosa was prepared to step aside because
the people had not given him the majority required for an outright
victory. Vargas Llosa received 32 percent while Fujimori, an
agricultural engineer and former university rector running as an
independent, received nearly 30 percent.
   The remaining votes were split between seven candidates.
   D'Ornellas said Vargas Llosa offered Fujimori his detailed plan
of government, which 200 economic specialists had composed. He said
the writer also proposed forming a bloc in congress of the two
candidates' supporters to guarantee Fujimori congressional backing.
   Vargas Llosa was persuaded to reconsider stepping down because
his decision might jeopardize the stability of a future Fujimori
government, the editor said.
   ``The mandate that Fujimori would receive after Vargas Llosa's
resignation could be questioned in the future, opening the doors to
a possible military coup,'' d'Ornellas wrote.
   Fujimori was given little chance of making the second round a
month ago, but a late surge in popularity sapped the ranks of
Vargas Llosa voters and propelled the Japanese-Peruvian into second
place.
   The left-of-center governing Aprista Party and Peru's leftist
parties have indicated they would most probably support Fujimori in
the second round. That would make a Vargas Llosa victory unlikely.
   Vargas Llosa's Democratic Front, a center-right coalition, also
fell far short of a majority in the congressional elections Sunday.
News reports suggested Vargas Llosa may not be interested in
leading the government without control of Congress.
   Without congressional support he would have great problems
imposing the harsh austerity measures he advocates to revive Peru's
moribund economy.

   An unmarried West German claimed he lost his
wife and four children in a North Sea ferry fire in a scam that
netted him $50, police said Wednesday.
   An estimated 168 people died in Saturday's disaster aboard the
Danish ferry the Scandinavian Star. People earlier put the estimate
at up to 200.
   Among those removed from earlier estimates was the non-existent
West German family, said Bjoern Gran, of the Oslo police department.
   ``No Germans are missing. He is not married, and there is no
record of him having any children. It was a swindle,'' said Gran.
   The policeman said the German, whom he declined to identify,
walked into offices of German and Belgian sailors' groups in
Antwerp, Belgium, and pleaded for cash. He claimed his family died
in the fire and that he had no money, said Gran.
   ``The Belgian clergyman did not think he looked grief-stricken
enough, so he called the German mission and then the police,'' said
Gran.
   The German, who had previous fraud convictions, disappeared,
Gran said.
   He got a total of about $50 from the seamen's groups. ``It
wasn't much money. But to try to take advantage of this kind of
tragedy is just unthinkable,'' said Gran.

`On March...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British customs officials impounded a shipment of
suspected gun parts bound for Iraq, officials reported Wednesday.
The seizure came two weeks after U.S.-made components for nuclear
detonators were confiscated en route to Baghdad.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said the
consignment impounded Tuesday night on a dock in northeastern
England included parts for a 131-foot gun barrel, apparently the
largest of its type ever made.
   ``It is capable of firing a nuclear shell which could easily hit
Iran or any other Middle East trouble spot from Iraq,'' Press
Association quoted an unidentified Customs and Excise Office
spokesman as saying.
   No one was arrested, the news agency said.
   Press Association said the massive cylinder was manufactured by
Sheffield Forgemasters of Sheffield.
   British Broadcasting Corp. television quoted a company spokesman
as saying that if the impounded material was indeed made by
Sheffield Forgemasters, it was a petroleum pipe _ not a gun barrel.
   On March 28, customs authorities seized American components for
nuclear bomb triggers and arrested five people in a case that
aggravated Western worries about Iraq's military capabilities and
plans.
   Customs officials confirmed the goods were stopped. ``Last
night, we intercepted a consignment of goods being loaded upon a
ship that was destined for Iraq, a ship that had been chartered by
the Iraqi Maritime Services. The goods appear to be of a military
nature,'' a Customs spokesman said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   On Wednesday morning, Customs officers raided offices in
Sheffield and Birmingham ``and took away papers relevant to the
specifications, ordering and delivery arrangements for this piece
of equipment,'' the spokesman said.
   Press Association quoted the Customs spokesman as saying, ``We
are considering the possibility that the gun was made to order in
Britain for the Iraqis.''
   The agency said the parts were packed in eight crates on the
dock at Middlesbrough.
   The shipment impounded Tuesday was about to be loaded on the
Bermuda-registered Gur Mariner, Press Association said. It will not
be formally seized unless it is positively identified as containing
weapon parts, Press Association said.
   ``It is certainly the biggest gun barrel we have ever uncovered
in this country,'' the Customs spokesman said, according to the
agency.
   The largest gun built previously was the U.S. High Altitude
Research Project gun with barrels 119 feet long, according to the
Guinness Book of Records.
   There was no immediate reaction to the impoundment Wednesday
from Iraq.
   After the March 28 seizure, the Iraqi government denied
involvement in the alleged smuggling. Iraq has also denied it seeks
to develop nuclear weapons.
   However, earlier this month, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
threatened to attack Israel with binary chemical weapons if it
attacks Iraqi installations.
   That threat, along with the smuggling case in Britain, brought a
chorus of anti-Iraqi criticism from Western governments and news
media.
   Iraqi officials have accused Western governments of deliberately
orchestrating the campaign to prepare for an Israeli attack.
   British relations with Iraq have also been soured by Iraq's
hanging March 15 of an Iranian-born journalist based in Britain. He
was accused of spying.

   West Germans would welcome a complete
withdrawal of U.S. troops from their country, but Americans have
reservations about leaving, according to poll results released
Wednesday.
   The telephone poll conducted in March found 66.3 percent of
Americans and 78.4 percent of West Germans favored reunification of
East and West Germany.
   A total U.S. troop withdrawal from West Germany would be
welcome, said 56.5 percent of Germans surveyed while 38.6 percent
said they would not welcome such a move.
   Among Americans, 11.9 percent favored a total withdawal, 43.9
percent wanted a cut in the number of U.S. troops stationed in West
Germany and 41.9 percent wanted no change.
   Just 34 percent of Americans said a unified Germany could
threaten peace in Europe. They cited fears of a powerful economy, a
revival of fascism and an attempt to expand territory.
   The survey found 76.8 percent of West Germans accepted the
current border with Poland and giving up any claims to former
German lands taken over by Poland after World War II. Sixteen
percent of West Germans said they did not accept the current border
with Poland.
   The telephone survey, conducted in early March by German and
American polling organizations, was sponsored by the Friedrich
Naumann Foundation, a research institute affiliated with the West
German Free Democratic Party.
   The Germans were asked to rate world leaders from minus 5 for
those they like least to plus 5 for those they like most. Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev was most popular with a 3.7 average
rating, followed by Bush at 2.3 and French President Francois
Mitterrand at 1.8.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was last with a minus
0.9. Pollster Holli A. Semetko of the Institute for Social Research
in Ann Arbor, Mich., attributed Mrs. Thatcher's unpopularity to her
misgivings about German unification.
   Americans were not asked to rate leaders, but they gave Britain
a popularity rating of 2.9, compared with 2.2 for West Germany, 2.0
for France, 1.6 for Poland, 1.5 for Japan, 0.9 for Israel and 0.7
for the Soviet Union.
   The West Germans put France at the top of their list at 2.4, the
United States at 2.2, the Soviet Union at 1.6, Japan at 1.2,
Britain at 0.5, Israel at 0.3 and Poland at 0.1.
   Britain was named as the West European country on which the
United States could most rely by 56.3 percent of Americans, far
more than the 12.3 percent who chose West Germany and 6.3 percent
that picked France.
   The poll found that 67.4 percent of Americans viewed the
Japanese as friendly, compared with 66 percent rating Germans as
friendly. Among Germans, 88.6 percent said the Japanese were
friendly, and 82.5 said Americans were friendly.
   Japan was viewed as a threat to the U.S. economy by 82.5 percent
of Americans, but only 21.3 percent saw West Germany as a threat.
Among Germans, 56.6 percent saw an economic threat from Japan,
compared with 10.5 percent seeing a threat from the United States.

<HEAD>Government Calls on Exiled King to Postpone Planned Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The interim government on Wednesday
appealed to exiled King Michael of Romania to postpone his return
to the country he left 42 years ago, saying they were worried his
visit could provoke violence.
   In Geneva, the king's oldest daughter, Princess Margarita, said
her father and mother, Queen Anne, will go ahead with their
Thursday visit to Romania. Margarita, scheduled to join her parents
in Bucharest, said the deposed monarch will visit as a private
citizen and plans to attend Easter services.
   It would be the first time King Michael has set foot on Romanian
soil since he was forced into exile by the Communists on Dec. 30,
1947.
   The government urged Michael to postpone his visit until after
national elections, scheduled for May 20.
   In a statement by the state news agency Rompres, the government
said it feared the visit could lead to violence.
   ``It is increasingly clear that the former king's visit to this
country at this time would be of a nature exacerbating existing
conflicts, while also endangering his personal security,'' it said.
   The statement said that ``there is a possibility of some violent
manifestations'' during Michael's visit.
   Princess Margarita, said Wednesday on Swiss television that
Michael was returning to Romania on a spiritual pilgrimage and was
not concerned with possible violence.
   ``My father is Romanian and every citizen ... has the right to
return to his country to pray at the festival of Easter,'' she said
in the French- language broadcast.
   She said the king ``has absolute confidence in the Romanian
people. There is no indication that the Romanian people will not
welcome him.''
   ``He will represent history ... traditions and perhaps hope, but
from the political point of view this visit is private,'' she said.
   The exiled king, who lives in the Swiss village of Versoix, near
Geneva, plans to attend midnight Mass Saturday at Bucharest's
Patriarhie Cathedral to mark Orthodox Easter.
   Earlier this week, several political parties asked that the
visit be postponed until after national elections, citing fears
that it could affect the campaign.
   Raud Campeanu, presidential candidate for one of the leading
parties, the National Liberal Party, said Michael should not come
before the elections, ``thinking he is wanted.''
   Only two of the almost 70 parties that have formed since
December's overthrow of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu have advocated
the establishment of a constitutional monarchy.
   Following the December revolution, Michael said he was prepared
to return as monarch but indicated the move must be approved by a
national referendum.
   Michael's second daughter, Princess Helen, 39, arrived Tuesday
in Bucharest with a convoy carrying 130 tons of relief material.

   The man accused of starting a nightclub fire
that killed 87 people in the deadliest U.S. blaze in 13 years
pleaded innocent Wednesday to 174 murder charges and other counts.
   Julio Gonzalez, guarded by four marshals and speaking through a
Spanish translator, mumbled ``no culpable'' when asked how he
pleaded to the charges during his arraignment in the borough of the
Bronx.
   Gonzalez, 36, is accused of setting the March 25 fire that raced
through the Happy Land social club, trapping most patrons on the
second floor of the tiny, illegal establishment and killing 87
people, mostly Honduran immigrants. Only five people escaped the
deadliest blaze since a 1977 nightclub fire in Southgate, Ky.
   A grand jury indicted Gonzalez on double murder charges for each
victim, one for murder by arson and the other for murder by
depraved indifference. He also was charged with two counts of arson
and one each of assault and attempted murder.
   At the time, there was speculation that Gonzalez could be
sentenced to several thousand years in prison if convicted on all
charges.
   But state Judge Burton R. Roberts said Wednesday that Gonzalez
could be sentenced to only one term of 25 years to life and might
be eligible for parole in 25 years even if convicted on all murder
charges. Roberts said that under state law, when there are two or
more victims from a single crime, sentences must run concurrently
rather than consecutively, as in separate crimes.
   The judge acknowledged that the social club fire was a special
case, but said he wanted to dispel misconceptions about a possible
penalty.
   Roberts set the next court appearance for April 25. ``I
understand we're a long way from trial,'' the judge said.
   Gonzalez is undergoing a psychiatric evaluation at Bellevue
Hospital.
   Assistant District Attorney Eric Warner gave Gonzalez'
court-appointed attorney, Richard W. Berne, transcripts of a
videotaped statement in which Gonzalez, according to police, admits
setting the fire after a fight with a former girlfriend working at
the club. Warner said he would also give Berne the videotape to
copy.
   Berne said he planned to move for dismissal of all charges on
grounds he was not given access to the taped statement before
having to decide whether his client should testify before the grand
jury. Gonzalez did not appear before the panel.
   Berne conceded his motion to dismiss, even if granted, was a
``procedural matter'' and that the prosecution would be sure to
request a new indictment of Gonzalez.

   The premier and five other Cabinet
members of ethnically troubled Kosovo province have resigned after
four months in office, citing pressure by Serbia, the official
Tanjug news agency reported Wednesday.
   The ``irrevocable'' resignations of Premier Jusuf Zejnulahu,
Deputy Premier Mazlum Bega and the four others coincided with
strong criticism leveled against Serbia's communist authorities
Wednesday by a U.S. congressional delegation for alleged human
rights abuses against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
   Kosovo province, an administrative part of the Serbian republic,
has been a scene of continuing unrest since Serbia assumed
near-total control over the region the past year _ virtually
abolishing its former autonomy _ and introduced a state of
emergency to suppress huge protests by Albanians.
   Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's 1.9 million
population. Tanjug did not make clear when the resignations were
offered, but a newspaper said Zejnulahu offered his Tuesday.
Zejnulahu, Bega and the other ministers are all ethnic Albanians.
   First indications of a rift between the provincial Communist
Party leadership and the government emerged a few weeks ago.
   The Belgrade daily Borba carried Wednesday what it said was
Zejnulahu's letter of resignation to Parliament.
   In the letter, Zejnulahu reportedly charged that Kosovo's
Serbian-dominated communist authorities undermined government
efforts to resolve the difficult situation in the province by
leveling a stream of unfounded accusations against his
administration.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., leader of the U.S. fact-finding
mission, told reporters after returning from a one-day visit to
Kosovo, ``We noted with great concern the heavy-handed (practices)
that have caused great problems and offered no solutions for
Kosovo.''
   DeConcini said ``atrocities'' committed by Serbian police
against ethnic Albanians could not solve the intercommunal
tensions, which led to at least 60 people of Albanian origin being
killed the past 13 months.
   Serbian authorities say Kosovo's mainly Christian Slav minority
is harassed and terrorized by ethnic Albanians, who are
predominantly Moslem.
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Serbia's communist leader Slobodan
Milosevic, who met with the four-member delegation Tuesday, was
``inflexible'' and refused to accept a dialogue with ethnic
Albanian alternative movements, describing them as ``separatist and
terrorist.''
   Also Wednesday, the military filed criminal slander charges
against a secessionist presidential candidate in the republic of
Slovenia, Tanjug reported.
   Tanjug said the candidate, Joze Pucnik, accused the army of
``killing our children, poisoning our economy and imperiling our
freedom.'' It did not elaborate.
   Slander charges were filed in the Slovenian city of Maribor on
April 6, said Col. Vuk Obradovic, an army spokesman. He said the
army was insulted by Pucnik's remarks.
   A slander conviction could bring a jail sentence of up to three
years.
   Pucnik said in a telephone interview he was not prepared to
comment on the report.
   Slovenia will choose its first freely elected president since
1945 in a runoff between Pucnik, a conservative secessionist, and
Milan Kucan, a Communist reformer, April 22.

   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi accused President Bush
of ``reversing the truth'' by saying the emigration of Soviet Jews
to Israel was a march of freedom, the official Libyan news agency
JANA reported Wednesday.
   Gadhafi referred to Bush's Passover message issued Monday, in
which Bush said, ``A great march of freedom is under way for Soviet
Jewry, and this year many thousands will celebrate the Seder with
their families in Israel.''
   JANA quoted Gadhafi as saying Palestinians had been expelled
from their homeland in ``the biggest deportation process witnessed
by contemporary history.''
   ``Facing such crime we see the U.S. president reversing the
truth,'' he said, according to the dispatch, monitored in Rome.
   Palestinians and Arabs object to resettling large numbers of
Soviet Jewish emigrants in Israel and vehemently oppose moving them
to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Gadhafi said the ``greatest march of history'' was the one begun
by the Libyan revolution, which had ``overwhelmed Eastern Europe
and will overwhelm Western Europe and America,'' JANA reported.
   The leader of the radical Arab North African country also
criticized the formation of ``revolutionary'' political parties or
religious-based parties in various countries. He said such parties
were ``bound to fail, because it is not an era in which rule can be
achieved in the name of vanguard, sect or denominations,'' a
separate JANA dispatch said.
   Gadhafi suggested formation of Libyan-style ``people's
congresses'' instead of parties.

<TEXT>
   The senior Nicaraguan Contra
commander announced Wednesday that his rebels will not give up
fighting until Sandinistas in Nicaragua's military bow to civilian
rule.
   It was the harshest statement yet by Contra leader Israel
Galeano since his subordinates signed an agreement with aides of
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro to disarm by her April
25 inauguration.
   There was no immediate response by the outgoing Sandinista
government in Managua, but it has said the refusal of the Contras
to disband could threaten the transition.
   Galeano said in an interview that he will refuse to turn over
arms to peacekeeping forces of the United Nations or the
Organization of American States until ``true democracy'' emerges in
Nicaragua.
   ``Mrs. Chamorro defeated the Sandinistas in elections, but I
believe she will not be able to impose her authority on the
Sandinistas once she takes office,'' Galeano said. ``And if she
doesn't, there will be no democracy in Nicaragua.''
   He said ``from the mountains in Nicaragua, armed and at the head
of my troops, I shall observe the process of demilitarizing the
Sandinista army.''
   Galeano said his ``rebel army will honor its commitments and
will abandon its camps in Honduras on April 18. But the army of
resistance will continue fighting in the mountains inside Nicaragua
until there is true democracy in our nation.''
   Mrs. Chamorro's U.S.-supported coalition of 14 parties won
elections Feb. 25 by a landslide, ending a decade of leftist
Sandinista rule.
   But the Sandinistas have insisted the Contras, which they have
been fighting for nine years, demobilize immediately while the
Sandinista People's Army _ except for its uppermost ranks _ remain
intact.
   About 9,000 armed Contras have infiltrated back into Nicaragua
in recent weeks, leaving behind 1,000 wounded rebels and stragglers
with old firearms at their base camps at the Honduran border town
of Yamales.
   On Monday, the Contras and Mrs. Chamorro's representatives
agreed to start dismantling their Yamales camps April 18, under the
supervision of U.N. and OAS peacekeepers.
   The rest of the Contras were also expected to rally in ``safety
zones'' inside Nicaragua to surrender their weapons and disband,
once the international peacekeepers arranged cease-fires with
Sandinista troops.
   Contra spokesman Alejandro Acevedo announced in Tegucigalpa he
and six other members of a special rebel commission, including
three civilians, will go to Managua on Monday to try to negotiate a
truce to the fighting.
   ``We are going to negotiate a definite cease-fire,'' he said.
   Acevedo said the commission will meet with Roman Catholic
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Mrs. Chamorro and officials of her
United National Opposition _ but not with the Sandinistas.
   Galeano said only the rebels who remain in Honduras will
surrender their weapons.
   Oscar Sovalbarro, another Contra commander, also urged
Sandinista military officers to step down. ``It is important that
all the high officers leave their positions in the Popular
Sandinista Army,'' he told Radio Catolica, the Roman Catholic
Church station.
   Under a transition protocol that Sandinistas and UNO signed
March 27, Mrs. Chamorro promised to respect ``the integrity and
professionalism'' of the armed forces but prohibited all senior
officers from holding positions of leadership in any political
parties.
   The protocol was a compromise that allows the Sandinistas to
retain control of the army while giving it at least a semblance of
political neutrality.
   The Contras contend the army will remain a branch of the
Sandinista party.

<HEAD>Kentucky, Mississippi Governors Sign Far-Reaching Educational
Reform Bills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Kentucky's governor signed a bill Wednesday making unprecedented
changes in the administration of his state's struggling schools,
and Mississippi's governor approved nearly $1 billion in aid to the
nation's lowest-rated school system.
   In Frankfort, Ky., Gov. Wallace Wilkinson said the bill, which
turns the state into a national laboratory for school reform, was
as significant as drafting the state constitution.
   The 1,000-page statute establishes a minimum spending level of
$2,900 for each of Kentucky's 570,000 students. Under the old
system, spending varied from $1,800 to $4,200 a year per student,
depending on a district's wealth.
   In the new system, ``geography is a subject to be taught, not a
factor that determines the quality of a child's education,'' said
Wilkinson, who said he had been a victim of unequal educational
opportunity as a child.
   The measure raises taxes by about $1.3 billion over the next two
years; about half the money goes to school reform.
   It also eliminates grades for the youngest students and calls
for committees of parents, teachers and principals to make
day-to-day decisions on running schools.
   In Jackson, Miss., Gov. Roy Mabus signed a bill committing $182
million to improve public school curricula over the next three
years and another calling for nearly $800 million in bonds to
replace aging school buildings and buses. He called the package
``far-reaching'' and ``visionary.''
   But Mabus said he'd call a special legislative session June 18
because lawmakers didn't fund the program during their regular
session, which ended Friday. ``All of us had a mandate from the
people to significantly improve the way we educate our children,''
he said.
   Kentucky's law was spurred by a state Supreme Court ruling last
June that the state's public school system was inequitable and
unconstitutional, and followed nearly a year of political
wrangling. The state has the lowest percentage of high school
graduates in the nation.
   Wilkinson signed the bill at the Frankfort Civic Center as
hundreds of schoolchildren shipped in for the occasion looked on.
   The governor said other states face the same sort of court
orders to restructure their school systems. ``Once they see what we
have accomplished, they are sure to follow,'' he said.
   In recent years, courts have ordered 11 states, including
Kentucky, to overhaul inequitable school finance systems. The
others are New Jersey, Kansas, Wisconsin, California, Connecticut,
Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, Arkansas and Montana.
   In Mississippi, students have consistently scored lowest in the
nation on standardized achievement tests, although their
performance has improved since a series of school reforms adopted
in 1982.
   In addition to curriculum improvements, the new reform package
provides for programs to fight illiteracy, teen-age pregnancy and
dropouts in the 505,000-student public school system.
   The immediate challenge is finding the money to pay for the
program. Mabus proposed a lottery to fund about a third of the
reform package introduced in August, but the Senate killed the
lottery and attempts to revive it. Mabus rejected the idea of a tax
increase.
   ``It's going to be a difficult task, but I think the Legislature
is committed to funding the programs,'' state Sen. Irb Benjamin,
who heads the Senate Education Committee, said Wednesday.
   The package calls for the state to finance all curriculum
improvements and issue bonds to pay for new buildings and buses.
Local districts would repay 80 percent of the money borrowed for
construction projects, and 20 percent of the funds for improving
transportation.

<HEAD>Prison Officer Escapes from Rebellious Inmates in Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prison guard escaped Wednesday from inmates
holding him hostage in a Scottish jail and the prisoners then gave
up, government officials said.
   Twelve British prisons have been wracked by disturbances this
month, beginning April 1 at Strangeways Prison in the northern
English city of Manchester. Three more prisoners surrendered there
Wenesday, leaving fewer than 15 on the loose.
   Guard Jim Rankin, 30, escaped unharmed after being held 20 hours
by rampaging inmates at Shotts jail, the Scottish Office said. The
40 inmates involved in the disturbance surrendered shortly after
the officer escaped, said the office, which runs Scottish prisons.
   Two guards were injured in the rampage Tuesday night, the office
said.
   Dartmoor prison in southwest England was hit by another
disturbance Wednesday night when three prisoners got onto the roof
of a prison wing, said the Home Office, which is responsible for
prisons in England and Wales. The three surrendered late Wednesday,
the Home Office said.
   The lawyer for Paul Taylor, the self-described ringleader of the
rioters at Strangeways, said his client was about to give up.
   ``Mr. Taylor seemed to be in good spirits,'' John Ballam told
reporters after meeting with Taylor through a fence. ``He was a
little tired, but calm. In his own words, he said he would be
giving himself up in the next day or so.''
   Prison authorities have ruled out taking the facility by force.
Instead, they have relied on negotiations and harassment to wear
down the rebellious prisoners.
   During the rioting, one prisoner suffered fatal injuries, and a
guard died of an apparent heart attack.
   In response to demands by the Prison Officers' Association, Home
Secretary David Waddington announced Wednesday that 200 more
officers will be recruited immediately instead of waiting until
1991.
   Waddington also announced 3,000 vacant prison cells will be
returned to use to ease overcrowding.
   Other prisons hit by rioting include Bristol in western England,
Cardiff in Wales, Hull in northeast England, Leeds in northern
England and London's Pentonville and Brixton prisons.
   Disturbances were also reported at three young offenders
institutions.

<TEXT>
   Ann Richards, who won the Democratic
nomination in a ``mudslide,'' and Republican Clayton Williams,
still stinging from criticism after a joke about rape, promised to
stick to issues as they vied for governor.
   ``Both Clayton Williams and I will work very hard to keep this
an ideological campaign where we really do focus on the issues
because we do have disagreements on the issues,'' Ms. Richards said
after defeating state Attorney General Jim Mattox in Tuesday's
down-and-dirty primary runoff.
   Williams, who earlier voiced reluctance about running against a
woman, said, ``The rehash of the Democratic campaign is of no
interest to me. Read my lips: No more mud.''
   There was little discussion of the issues in the runoff, in
which Mattox alleged that Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic,
used illegal drugs, including cocaine, 10 years ago when she was a
Travis County commissioner.
   ``The voters didn't care about that issue as deeply as I do, or
as deeply as I thought they did,'' Mattox, who had called the
runoff a referendum on the drug question, told an Austin news
conference Wednesday afternoon.
   Ms. Richards said the issue of whether she has used illegal
drugs ``was put to rest'' after her overwhelming runoff victory.
   Ms. Richards, 56, now state treasurer, accused Mattox, 46, of
profiting from public service and challenged him to release his
income tax returns.
   The last week of the campaign brought newspaper reports that
Mattox was seen smoking marijuana in the mid-1970s and that Ms.
Richards was seen in a restroom where marijuana allegedly was being
smoked in 1979. Both dismissed the reports.
   They also accused the each other of starting the mudslinging,
but Ms. Richards said her victory showed that Mattox's negative
campaigning turned off voters.
   She handed Mattox his first major political defeat in 18 years,
rolling up a margin of 639,126, or 57 percent, to Mattox's 479,384,
or 43 percent, in unofficial returns.
   Mattox said Wednesday that he was defeated because of a growing
trend of women being elected to higher office regardless of their
credentials. He said Ms. Richards enjoyed the support of a
ready-made nationwide network of feminists despite his strong
advocacy of civil rights and women's issues.
   In a separate news conference, Ms. Richards claimed support from
both men and women.
   ``I never felt that women support women simply because they're
women,'' she said.
   Slightly more than 15 percent of the state's 8.3 million
registered voters cast ballots in the runoff, the highest runoff
turnout since 2 million Texans went to the polls in 1972, said
Secretary of State George Bayoud. Turnout in the March 13 primary
was 28 percent.
   Voters' attention was taken off the runoff briefly when
Williams, a rancher and oilman in Midland, told reporters during
his spring cattle roundup that bad weather was like rape _ if it's
inevitable, ``relax and enjoy it.''
   Williams, 58, who has never run for political office, apologized
for the comment, but Ms. Richards said it illustrated his
inexperience in public life.
   Aside from promising not to raise taxes, both candidates are at
opposite ends on most issues, including abortion rights. Ms.
Richards is pro-choice. Williams opposes abortion except in cases
of rape, incest and endangerment of the mother.
   The victor in November's election will not have an easy task.
Court-ordered education reforms, according to current proposals,
will cost anywhere from $4 billion to $10 billion during the next
governor's term and the state welfare agency is projecting a $550
million deficit next year.
   Mattox and his supporters say they will forget the runoff
mudbath and rally behind Ms. Richards.
   ``I want to send a sincere congratulations to Ann Richards,''
said Mattox, who has won every political race he has entered since
1972, including the state House, Congress and attorney general.
   ``I will be ready to help her up and down the state against the
common enemy, and the common enemy is Clayton Williams,'' he said.
   Incumbent Republican Bill Clements, 72, is not seeking
re-election.

<HEAD>Striking Drivers to Face Charges in Shots Fired at Buses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two striking Greyhound drivers were ordered
held without bond Wednesday on charges they fired shots at a
company bus last month just east of the city.
   Roy B. Simes, 35, and Harry T. Lewis, 42, both of suburban St.
Louis, appeared Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate Frederick R.
Buckles. A federal agent said one of the men confessed to the March
22 attack in Troy, Ill.
   Buckles is to determine whether bond should be set for the
defendants and whether they should be moved to East St. Louis,
Ill., where federal charges against them were filed Tuesday.
   Greyhound Lines Inc. has reported more than 30 shooting attacks
on its buses, 70 bomb threats and more than 100 incidents of
violence. A picketing driver was killed March 3 in Redding, Calif.,
when he was crushed by a bus driven by a replacement driver.
   A number of drivers attended Wednesday's brief court session,
and some shouted encouragement as Simes and Lewis were led out of
the courtroom.
   ``Hang in there, guys,'' said Don McCulley, committeeman of
Amalgamated Transit Local 1500 in St. Louis. McCulley said that he
was shocked at the charges and did not believe the defendants could
have fired the shots.
   ``I've told them and told them, `No violence, no violence,'''
McCulley said.
   Authorities said Simes and Lewis, who were arrested Tuesday, are
suspects in another bus shooting in south St. Louis County earlier
the same morning as the Illinois incident.
   According to an affidavit by U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms agent Stephen Higgins, Simes admitted he and Lewis were
involved in both shootings. The complaint said Simes also consented
to a search of his residence and turned over a .22-caliber revolver.
   Greyhound's 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 office and maintenance
workers walked out March 2 in an argument over wages and job
security. Greyhound has been operating a reduced schedule since,
using permanent replacements and drivers willing to cross picket
lines.
   Greyhound President Frank Schmieder says a strong Easter holiday
weekend could boost the company to the financial break-even point.
The five-day Easter travel period ending Monday is one of the five
busiest times of the year for Greyhound.
   Schmieder said in an interview this week that the company
projects revenue in the next few days will be between 70 percent
and 73 percent of revenue at the same time last year.
   ``Seventy-three percent of revenue is cash break even, and when
we do that, we figure we've turned the corner,'' said Schmeider.
   Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions, called Greyhound's latest claims
``preposterous.''
   ``They've been claiming they turned corners for the last six
weeks,'' said Nelson.
   Negotiations have been stalled since last month. The company has
refused to bargain until seven days have passed without major
violence.
   Simes and Lewis have been charged with endangering people on
board a vehicle used in interstate or foreign commerce, commission
of a felony with a firearm that has been transported in interstate
commerce and use of a firearm during the commission of a violent
crime.
   If convicted, each would face up to 10 years in jail and a
$10,000 fine.
   Their arrests were the second and third nationwide since the
strike began. The other arrest took place March 16, when a striking
driver was accused of shooting at a bus March 12 near Hartford,
Conn.

<HEAD>Obsessed Fan Convicted of Attacking Actress Remains Jailed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The obsessed fan who stalked and nearly
killed actress Theresa Saldana eight years ago was scheduled for
parole Wednesday, but he was kept in prison for threatening her
again, a prosecutor's spokesman said.
   ``If he had been a good little boy and not threatened Theresa
Saldana while in prison, he would have ... been a free man today,''
said Mike Botula, news secretary for the district attorney's office.
   Arthur Jackson, 54, was convicted of attempted murder and
assault with a deadly weapon in the March 15, 1982, attack on Miss
Saldana. He attacked the actress outside her apartment, stabbing
her 10 times and bending the blade of his kitchen knife with the
force of his blows.
   His 12-year sentence had been cut in half for good behavior.
   Jackson was being held at the Men's Central Jail without bail
Wednesday pending trial on 16 felony counts of menacing Miss
Saldana and her rescuer, Jeff Fenn, Botula said.
   Jackson could enter pleas to the new charges as early as Friday,
when a preliminary hearing is scheduled, Botula said.
   The prisoner was transferred last month from the California
Medical Facility in Vacaville to county custody for a March 15
arraignment, which was postponed because he didn't have an
attorney, Botula said.
   Deputy District Attorney William W. Hodgman said Jackson still
poses a danger to the actress. ``It is evident he still has a
fixation on Theresa Saldana,'' the prosecutor said.
   The latest charges were based on seven letters sent to Miss
Saldana and Fenn, a former water deliveryman who rescued her in
front of her West Hollywood apartment and held Jackson for police.
Fenn is now a sheriff's deputy.
   ``The general tone of the letters was he was making special
demands and if she didn't meet those demands he would have her
assassinated,'' Hodgman said, refusing to elaborate.
   Jackson, a Scottish drifter with a history of mental problems,
entered the United States illegally in 1982 to stalk Miss Saldana.
Authorities said he became obsessed with her after watching her
films, including ``Raging Bull'' and ``I Want to Hold Your Hand.''
   Jackson is charged with eight counts of threatening to use force
and eight of making terrorist threats in letters.
   The charges carry a maximum seven years and eight months in
prison. But if convicted, Jackson faces sentencing under provisions
of a 1986 state law that bars freeing deranged inmates who continue
to make credible threats.
   The law, inspired by the Saldana case, makes it a crime for a
convicted felon to threaten a victim or witness.
   Authorities learned weeks before his scheduled release last June
that Jackson had allegedly sent the letters. At the same time as
charges were filed in Los Angeles, prison authorities tacked 270
more days onto his sentence for three custody violations, including
breaking prison windows.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze has expressed interest in dual NATO-Warsaw Pact
membership for a united Germany, according to an article to be
published next month.
   Shevardnadze also said he foresaw a security arrangement among
Europe, the Soviet Union and North America that eventually would
replace both military alliances.
   ``Many of our experts ... believe that the idea of `dual
membership' for Germany could provide a pragmatic way out of the
difficulties emerging now,'' Shevardnadze wrote in a piece for the
May issue of NATO's Sixteen Nations. It is an independent magazine
covering international security issues.
   ``I would favor a serious and thorough analysis of this
option,'' he said.
   But the Bush administration on Wednesday rejected the idea of a
united Germany's temporarily being part of both NATO and the Warsaw
Pact and insisted Germany would have to side with the Western
alliance.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``That
Germany should be a member of NATO and the Warsaw Pact is another
formula for neutrality. It is a status that we believe, the Germans
themselves and their neighbors believe is undesirable. We strongly
support full membership of a united Germany in NATO.
   ``We are opposed to neutrality.''
   Last week in Washington, U.S. officials said the Soviet Union
dropped its demand that a unified Germany be militarily neutral. It
continued to oppose membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   West Germany is a NATO member. East Germany is in the
Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact.
   The Soviet foreign minister wrote that dual membership proposal
``would help overcome further the division of Europe, contribute to
its unification and create integrated spaces in it.'' The article
was made available Wednesday to The Associated Press.
   Reacting to the article, NATO spokesman Florent Swijsen said the
16-nation Western alliance remains opposed to dual membership.
   ``The allies are not considering the possibility of a unified
Germany being part of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact,'' he said in a
statement. ``Even several members of the latter (Warsaw Pact) have
indicated their preference for a united Germany as a member of
NATO.''
   NATO officials have said that after unification, Soviet troops
could be temporarily stationed in what is now East Germany.
   Shevardnadze said in his article that the Kremlin believed
``Germany should become a military non-aligned state and a
demilitarized state in the sense that it ought to possess the
lowest possible military capability sufficient for defense.''
   ``At the same time, we hold that in the final analysis Germany
should be a fully equal member of today's family of nations and
become a state like all other states,'' he wrote.
   He suggested the new state ``declare that it will not have
nuclear, chemical or other weapons of mass destruction.''
   The Soviet official outlined his view of how a ``Greater
Europe'' security structure should look, based on the 35-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The 35 nations _
the United States, Canada and all in Europe except Albania _ will
hold a summit later this year.
   He suggested the organization hold summit meetings of national
leaders every two years, with foreign ministers gathering yearly as
the top political body.
   ``Europe is heading for a new status in terms of its instruments
of security,'' Shevardnadze wrote. ``If and when the blocs vanish
into thin air _ and the process must not be artificially boosted _
no vacuum should be allowed to form.''

   A jury Wednesday began deliberating
whether former Sunday school teacher John E. List was a ``hideous
angel of death'' or was mentally disturbed when he killed his wife,
three children and mother.
   List's attorney, Elijah L. Miller Jr., has conceded during the
eight-day trial that List, 64, committed the killings 19 years ago.
But he sought a lesser verdict of second-degree murder.
   First-degree murder, as sought by the prosecution, required the
Union County Superior Court jury to find that List acted with
premeditation. It carries a life term, with parole eligibility in
15 years. Second-degree murder has a 30-year maximum, with parole
possible after a third of the term.
   The jurors deliberated for six hours, then recessed until
Thursday morning. Before stopping, they asked for a re-reading of
the judge's instructions on the element of first-degree murder,
willfullness, deliberation and premeditation.
   Authorities found the bodies of List's wife, Helen, 45; mother,
Alma, 84; daughter, Patricia, 16; and sons, John, 15 and Frederick,
13, in their 18-room Westfield mansion on Dec. 7, 1971.
   Miller argued that List, a pious and strictly raised Lutheran,
was watching his ``whole world falling to pieces'' when an
``obsessive-compulsive'' personality disorder _ combined with
twisted religious belief _ forced him to act.
   List was beset by pressures, couldn't provide for his family
after a series of job failures, and saw his family slipping from
the church, Miller said. He was also oppressed by the irrational
behavior of his wife, who suffered from terminal syphilis.
   List ruled out suicide because that would ensure his damnation,
Miller argued. Killing his children ensured their entry into
heaven, he said.
   ``He looked to religion for an answer, and he corrupted that
answer,'' said Miller.
   Eleanor Clark, an assistant prosecutor, argued that List ``acted
as a hideous angel of death, weighing the options right up until
the night before, killing his family. ...
   ``The state says today, `Mr. List, have you no shame!''' she
shouted, stalking toward the defense table, her index finger raised.
   Miller relied on testimony by psychiatric witnesses and five
ministers from List's past. The state presented 41 witnesses in 2{
days, most of them investigators, forensic experts and
acquaintances who traced List's actions the day of the slayings.
   List said he shot his victims in the back of the head to spare
them knowledge that they were about to die, Mrs. Clark told the
court, but she reminded the juors of autopsy reports that showed
the bullets entered the side of the heads.
   The younger John List was shot more than 10 times because he
struggled, List wrote in a letter to his pastor. Evidence indicated
that John surprised his father that day and knew something was
wrong.
   ``His father, his loving father, took a 9mm gun and a .22 and
riddled his body with bullets,'' she said.
   On the day of the slayings List wrapped up his affairs in a
meticulous manner. He cleaned the house, ate meals before and after
the killings, washed the dishes, left instructions on the funerals
and his financial affairs and withdrew money from the bank,
authorities said.
   The next day he dropped his car off at John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York and zig-zagged across the country
by train until settling in Denver because he liked mountains, List
told prosecution psychiatrist Steven S. Simring.
   Simring testified that List told him he expected to be caught
early on and constantly thought of the killings in the first year.
As he resumed another identity and remarried, the memory faded,
returning only on the anniversary of the killings, Simring said.
   List, an accountant who later moved to the Richmond, Va., area,
was arrested in June after the killings were dramatized on a
television crime show and a viewer tipped authorities.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake jolted western Japan Thursday
morning but no damage or injuries were reported, the Central
Meteorological Agency said.
   The earthquake, which had a preliminary reading of 6.3 on the
Richter scale, occurred 222 miles underground in the southwestern
part of Fukui prefecture (state), the agency said. Fukui is 200
miles west of Tokyo.
   An official of the agency's Seismic Division said shock waves
from an earthquake originating so deep underground largely
dissipate before reaching the surface and rarely cause damage, said
the official, who declined to be identified.
   On Wednesday afternoon, an earthquake measuring 5.5 struck
Kushiro and neighboring areas on Japan's northernmost major island
of Hokkaido, but police said there were no reports of injuries or
damage.
   That quake ocurred about 40 miles undersea off Kushiro, which is
540 miles north of Tokyo.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number on the scale means a
tenfold increase in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable
damage in populated areas. A quake measuring 6 is considered severe
and capable of widespread damage near the epicenter.

<TEXT>
   Leaking hydrogen gas fueled a fire and explosion
that shut down an oil-fired generator at the troubled Turkey Point
power plant complex Wednesday, utility officials said. No one was
injured.
   Two nuclear power plants and another oil-fired plant at Turkey
Point were not affected, spokesmen said. The fire was confined to
an enclosure housing an exciter, a small auxiliary generator.
   Plant operators took the Unit 2 generator off line when they
detected a loss of hydrogen pressure, and the fire was discovered
in the exciter about 15 minutes later, said Florida Power &amp; Light
Co. spokesman Gary Mehalik.
   The hydrogen is used to cool the generator.
   ``The visible damage is very, very moderate,'' said FPL
spokesman Dale Thomas.
   The plant's fire brigade had to put out the fire twice because
the highly flammable hydrogen continued leaking and exploded a
second time, he said.
   ``It has an invisible flame but it is searing hot,'' said Joe
Jenkins, director of the state Public Service Commission's electric
and gas division.
   The hydrogen leaked from the sealed room where the gas cools the
spinning generator, passed through a turbine shaft and into the
shed-sized exciter enclosure, Mehalik said.
   Utility workers will have to remove the generator housing on
Unit 2 to determine the extent of damage and the cost of repairs,
and that will take a day or two, Thomas said.
   Unit 2 was the only one operating at Turkey Point at the time of
the fire, which left the 2,090-megawatt plant idle idefinitely.
   One nuclear unit and one oil-fired unit were down for scheduled
maintenance, and the other nuclear unit automatically shut down
Monday when an electrical relay failed in an unrelated incident.
   The loss of Turkey Point's generating capacity was not
considered crucial because FPL could boost the power generated at
other plants or turn on idle units elsewhere in its system.
   FPL declared ``an unusual event'' at the nuclear plant Wednesday
for almost two hours even though the fire did not affect the
nuclear side of the operation, Mehalik said. The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission designation is the lowest emergency classification.
   The plant's nuclear units have been derided by consumer groups
as among the most unsafe nationally with a history of security
lapses and poor training.
   The utility responded by launching a major quality-control
improvement program and won Japan's most prestigious quality award
last October. The NRC took the plant off its ``watch list'' earlier
this year.
   Miami-based FPL is Florida's largest utility, serving 3 million
customers from Key West almost to Jacksonville.
   The power plant complex is in an unpopulated area on the edge of
Biscayne Bay about 30 miles south of downtown Miami.

<HEAD>Jewish Settlers Move into Christian Sector of Arab East Jerusalem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 150 Jews moved into the Christian sector
of Jerusalem's Old City Wednesday, sparking Arab outrage at the the
first Jewish presence in the area in 54 years, Arab and Israeli
sources said.
   Angry Christian Arabs threw stones at the settlers and Greek
Orthodox bishops arrived at the site to question the legality of
the move, Arab sources said.
   There were no reports of injuries and police spokesman Uzi
Sandori could not confirm any violence.
   Settler Shifra Blass, a spokeswoman for the Ataraot Cohanim
Yeshiva, or Jewish seminary, said the families moved into a
building in the Christian Quarter as part of an effort to expand
the Jewish presence in Arab areas.
   ``We are doing the worthwhile job of advancing the avowed
government policy of Jewish settlement throughout the city,'' Blass
said.
   Mahdi Abdul Hadi, director of an Arab think tank on foreign
policy in East Jerusalem said the settlers were ``escalating the
confrontation by provoking Palestinians in their daily life.''
   ``They are threatening the present and future existence of the
Palestinians in this city,'' he said.
   Benny Elon, an official at the seminary, said the institute
legally purchased the building in the Christian Quarter in a secret
deal with an Arab resident. He would not say when the purchase was
made.
   Officials at the Greek Orthodox church said the building is
church property and was illegally acquired.
   Sandori said a police investigation concluded that the purchase
was legal.
   Almost 50,000 Moslems live in the Old City, along with 7,000
Christians and approximately 4,000 Jews.
   More than 3,000 of those Jews live in the Jewish Quarter. The
Moslem Quarter is home to 40 Jewish families and two seminaries
including Ataraot Cohanim.
   The two-story building under question is near the Jewish Quarter
and is in an area that was a thriving Jewish commercial center in
the nineteenth century.
   The Jews living in that commercial center fled in 1936 after a
series of Arab riots.
   Israel captured the Old City along with the West Bank from
Jordan in the 1967 Arab Israeli war. The government annexed the Old
City shortly after the war and called the unified city Israel's
eternal and indivisible capital.
   The capital has not escaped the violence that has surged through
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip since the Palestinian
uprising began in December 1987.
   Six Arabs and four Israelis have been killed in Jerusalem as a
result of uprising-related incidents.
   The latest attack was Friday when an unidentified assailant
stabbed a 35-year-old yeshiva student living in the Moslem Quarter,
slightly wounding him.

<TEXT>
   Hungary's ambassador said Wednesday his
government has instructed Soviet authorities to stop letting Jewish
emigres go to Israel via Budapest until the backlog is cleared of
those already holding tickets.
   Ambassador Erno Simonyi estimated it could take months before up
to 2,500 ticketed Soviet Jews are transported to Tel Aviv.
   Reacting to threats from Palestinian extremists, Hungary's
national airline Malev announced last month it would transport no
more Soviet Jews to Israel. Hungary later reversed the announcement
for scheduled flights and fired Malev's manager, but a ban remained
on charter flights for Soviet Jews.
   Simonyi told reporters, ``The Hungarian airline is now taking
without discrimination any nationals, including Soviet Jews. But we
aren't taking any new passengers until those who already have
tickets are transported.
   ``They are about 2,000-2,500, so it will take several weeks,
probably months.''
   He said Hungarian authorities also told the Soviet carrier
Aeroflot not to issue tickets on Malev flights from Budapest to Tel
Aviv.
   Simonyi apparently chose to address the issue in Cairo to
emphasize that the decision to continue flying Soviet Jews to
Israel should not affect Hungary's relations with Arab countries.
   As in the rest of the Arab world, emigration to Israel of
thousands of Soviet Jews has caused an uproar in Egypt, the only
Arab country at peace with the Jewish state.
   Simonyi said ``some 1,000'' Soviet Jews have used the
Budapest-Tel Aviv route since it opened last fall.
   Palestinians and Arab governments fear a large influx of new
Israelis will settle in lands Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt
in the 1967 Middle East War.
   Israeli officials say they expect up to 750,000 Soviet Jewish
immigrants by the end of the decade.

   New York City and state sued the federal
government on Wednesday in an effort to boost an expected
undercount of minorities in the 1990 census, which they claim uses
``biased and unconstitutional guidelines.''
   The legal action was joined by the cities of Chicago, Los
Angeles and Houston; Dade County, Fla.; the state of California;
the U.S. Conference of Mayors; the League of Cities; the NAACP and
the League of United Latin American Citizens.
   Mayor David Dinkins, calling the undercount of urban minorities
``a national disgrace,'' said that problem and other factors would
mean ``cities across the country will once again lose hundreds of
millions of dollars in federal aid and dozens of seats in
Congress.''
   ``Yet the national government _ from the White House to the
Commerce Department to the Census Bureau _ seems to want to pay it
no mind. They have gotten away with statistical malfeasance for 200
years and figure they can get away with it for another 10.''
   The lawsuit, filed against the Department of Commerce in U.S.
District Court, asks Judge Joseph McLaughlin to invalidate the
Census Bureau's ``biased and unconstitutional guidelines'' for
adjusting the expected undercount of minorities, Dinkins said.
   Around the country, more than 2.3 million of the 88.5 million
census forms mailed out to households could not be delivered, the
mayor said. In addition, 250,000 of them designated for delivery to
residents in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens had
been kept in the bureau's Indiana warehouse, he said.
   The city maintains it was undercounted by 450,000 people in the
1980 census and subsequently lost one congressman, one state
senator and one state assemblyman as well as $657 million in
federal aid, which was based on population.
   In a statement, Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant called
the timing of the lawsuit ``particularly unfortunate.''
   ``Today we are stretching all available resources to ensure that
every American is counted in the census. There is time enough later
to litigate the adequacy of this effort,'' she said.
   Former city Corporation Counsel Peter Zimroth, who is serving as
attorney on the lawsuit, said the city and state are seeking to
overturn guidelines set forth by the Commerce Department last month
concerning the accuracy of this year's count.
   The Commerce Department has claimed the right to decide whether
the census's raw figures are right or whether a post-census survey
sampling should be conducted, as the mayor and others have urged.
   Commerce has said it has the right to reject a survey even
though the survy might be more accurate on grounds that it would
``unduly disrupt the transfer of political power in the United
States,'' since census figures are used to determine electoral
districts, Zimroth said.
   Zimroth complained, ``That means the Department of Commerce
would decide what is fair representation.''
   The department's undersecretary for economic affairs, Michael R.
Darby, defended his agency's efforts.
   ``The guidelines are designed to ensure that we have the most
accurate census possible and to prevent manipulation of the census
figures for political purposes,'' Darby said in a statement.
   Mayor Jimmy Kemp of Meridian, Miss., a member of the census task
force of the United States Conference of Mayors, joined Dinkins in
the press conference in City Hall and said he, too, expected an
undercount and urged that an adjustment be made based on a
post-census survey.
   ``All persons count and all persons should be counted, whether
in Meridian, Miss., or New York City,'' he said. ``The overriding
issue is one of fairness.''

<TEXT>
   HAHN AIR BASE, West Germany _ The U.S. Air Force on Wednesday
pulled out the first of 64 cruise nuclear rockets to be removed
from West Germany by May 1991 under a U.S.-Soviet treaty.
   The first eight missiles, based with the other 56 at the
Wueschheim missile site seven miles north of Hahn Air Base, were
packed in special containers and then loaded aboard a giant C-5
transport jet for shipment to the United States.
   Air Force spokesman Capt. Eric Schnaible, briefing reporters
Wednesday, said the eight missiles would be returned to
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base at Tucson, Ariz., for destruction.
   The missiles were maintained by the Air Force's 38th Tactical
Missile Wing at Wueschheim.
   Another eight missiles will be shipped to the United States on
Friday, U.S. Air Force Col. Richard A. Myers said.
   Myers, commander of Wueschheim Air Station about 80 miles west
of Frankfurt, said all the cruise missiles will be out of West
Germany by the end of May 1991.
   The missile site was a frequent target of anti-nuclear
demonstrations before the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty was
signed by President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in December 1987.
   The INF treaty bans all U.S. and Soviet ground-launched nuclear
missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.

<HEAD>Ruling by Kuwait's Moslem Theologians Closes Oyster Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuwait's Islamic theologians ruled that buying
oysters on the chance they could bear pearls was sinful, and a
newspaper said Wednesday that the decision led to the closure of a
decades-old oyster market.
   The daily Al-Qabas said the formal prohibition came after a
citizen approached the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs
for an opinion on the practice.
   Islamic experts told The Associated Press that the practice was
considered tantamount to gambling, banned by the Moslem religion.
   ``The sale of pearls before cracking the oyster is illegal
because only Almighty God knows if it includes pearls or not,''
they quoted Sheik Mishaal Mubarak al-Sabah, head of the Islamic
judgment department, as saying.
   The newspaper explained that oysters in Kuwait are purchased for
the sole purpose of searching for pearls and compared the trade to
a lottery or gambling.
   If an oyster is cracked before a sale _ and sold as food _ the
purchase is legal, the newspaper said.
   Small-size varieties of the marine mollusk are considered a
delicacy in some Mediterranean countries, including Islamic
countries. The flesh inside the ones sold in Kuwait is also eaten
at times.
   According to Al-Qabas, the Minister of State for Municipal
Affairs Mohammed al-Refai, in response to the ruling, immediately
ordered the closure of the oyster market in Shuwaikh, which has
been running for decades. Shuwaikh is six miles north of Kuwait
city.
   Al-Qabas said the oyster dealers were protesting the closure of
the market and petitioning the concerned authorities.
   The oyster is sold in bags containing about seven pounds for a
price ranging from $20 to $155. Reports of pearl finds are
extremely rare.
   Diving and search for pearls once was a key occupation of
Kuwaitis. With the oil era and with the Japan's development of
artificial pearls, the occupation declined.

<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inmate who has AIDS was convicted
Wednesday of attempted murder for biting a sheriff's officer and
telling him to ``die, you pig!''
   A jury spent seven hours over two days before announcing its
conviction of Gregory D. Smith in the June 11 attack on Albert
Waddington, a Camden County corrections officer. The panel also
convicted Smith of four counts of aggravated assault, and one count
of making terroristic threats.
   The jury acquitted Smith on one count each of aggravated assault
and making terroristic threats in separate incidents involving two
other officers.
   Smith showed no emotion when the verdict was read.
   Waddington, 26, who has not tested positive for the AIDS virus,
clapped his hands and bowed his head as the jury foreman read the
guilty verdict. He quickly left the courthouse, and declined
comment.
   Smith shouted at the guard as he left, telling him, ``On your
way home, Waddington, stop in church and ask God to forgive you for
that lie.''
   He also shouted at Superior Court Judge John B. Mariano that he
would appeal, and sheriff's officers quickly handcuffed him and led
him away.
   Sentencing is scheduled for May 18. Smith, 26, who is serving a
five-year sentence for a robbery conviction, faces a maximum
sentence of 30 years imprisonment.
   Smith was indicted for attempted murder in August for biting
Waddington on the hand three times. Waddington contends Smith also
spat on him and said: ``Now die, you pig. Die from what I have.''
   Smith denied biting the guard. His attorney said the case was
generated by AIDS hysteria and that scratches on the officer's
hands were caused by the jagged edges of Smith's handcuffs.
   ``If it wasn't for AIDS this man would never have been here,''
defense attorney Ralph Kramer said outside the courtroom.
   ``I'm very happy for Al Waddington because he went through
hell,'' said Harold Kasselman, assistant county prosecutor. ``We're
not going to tolerate this kind of conduct on our corrections law
enforcement officers.''
   Kramer said he would appeal on the contention that the judge
improperly allowed the jury to consider testimony from a
prosecution medical expert who said there was a slight possibility
AIDS could be transmitted through a bite.
   He said medical experts maintain it is very unlikely that the
virus can be transmitted through contact such as biting or
spitting. The fatal disease is generally transmitted through
intravenous drug use, blood transfusions and sexual contact.
   The case is one of about 10 in the country in which an
AIDS-stricken individual has been accused of attempting to spread
the virus through biting or spitting. Medical and legal experts
fear it will fuel misconceptions about how the disease is
transmitted.
   ``What the criminal justice system is doing here is posing a
very serious crime for a highly improbable result,'' said Larry
Gostin, executive director of the American Society of Law and
Medicine and an associate professor at Harvard's School of Public
Health.

<HEAD>Jordan to End Martial Law; U.S. Senators See Hussein</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Minister Salem Massadeh said
Wednesday the government next month plans to scrap the 55-year-old
defense law under which martial law has been imposed in Jordan
since 1967.
   He said the government will propose a new law for potential
states of emergency when Parliament resumes its sessions early next
month.
   ``The law will cancel the old law, but it will be inactive until
it is used in emergency cases for the national security of the
country,'' Massadeh told a news conference.
   The announcement came as King Hussein discussed Middle East
issues Wednesday with a senior delegation of U.S. senators led by
Robert Dole, R-Kan. The senators spent more than three hours with
Hussein after arriving from Egypt. There were no substantive
details on the talks.
   Prime Minister Mudar Badran promised in December to cancel both
the defense law and martial law within six months.
   Jordan declared martial law under the 1935 legislation during
the Arabs' 1967 war with Israel, and the country has lived under
that decree ever since.
   But Badran this year stripped military courts of most functions
and returned power to civilian tribunals. He declared martial law
``frozen.''
   Both Jordan and Israel inherited versions of the defense law
from the British mandate period before World War II. Both have used
it widely.
   It provides much of the legal foundation for Israel's detention
without trial of thousands of Palestinians during the continuing
uprising on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Massadeh noted that the many laws and decrees imposed under
martial law over 23 years often affected routine affairs, and he
said the government is studying which need to be replaced by new
legislation proposed to Parliament.
   The action continues a yearlong series of liberalizing reforms
prompted largely by the April 1989 riots in southern Jordan over
economic problems and what was viewed as government high-handedness.
   The Parliament that will consider the new legislation was
elected in November during Jordan's first nationwide election since
1967.
   Jordan has also returned passports confiscated by the General
Intelligence Department, dropped all travel and work bans and freed
all of its purely political prisoners, according to government
officials.
   Massadeh said 31 people convicted of political offenses remain
in prison, but he said all were also convicted of other crimes,
such as possession, use or smuggling of arms and explosives or
attacking security forces.
   The U.S. senators meanwhile arranged to fly on to Baghdad
Thursday to discuss issues that have strained U.S. relations with
the Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein.
   The lawmakers ran into protests in Amman over a Senate
resolution recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
   A peaceful gathering of about 150 demonstrators, including
several former high-ranking officials, met the senators on their
return from the palace shortly before midnight to protest the
Senate action.
   ``We feel perfectly dismayed'' by the March 22 vote, former
Foreign Minister Hazem Nuseibeh told Dole.
   Nusibeh and other prominent Jerusalem figures gave the senators
a document outlining their opposition.
   Dole assured the group the Senate action was a non-binding
resolution that did not affect U.S. policy, which does not
recognize the disputed holy city as Israel's capital.
   ``I don't think it has any importance,'' Dole said. ``The big
picture is getting the peace process started.''
   Roughly half Jordan's 3.1 million people are from families that
lost homes in Palestine when Israel was created or when it captured
the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967.
   Columnist Tareq Masarweh noted in the daily newspaper Al Rai
that that one of the visitors, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, was
a sponsor of the Jerusalem resolution. ``Why should we welcome
him?'' asked Masarweh.
   Other delegates are Sens. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, James McClure
of Idaho, Frank Murkowski of Alaska and Charles Grassley of Iowa,
all Republicans.

   More than 1,500 friends and admirers,
including first lady Barbara Bush and singer Michael Jackson, bid
farewell Wednesday to Ryan White, the young AIDS victim who taught
the nation a lesson in courage.
   ``Ryan and his family always believed there would be a
miracle,'' the Rev. Raymond Probasco said in his eulogy. ``But that
didn't happen. I believe God gave us that miracle in Ryan. He
healed a wounded spirit in the world and made it whole.''
   Ryan's mother, Jeanne, sat with her 16-year-old daughter,
Andrea, and Jackson, who had befriended Ryan. Ryan's father, Wayne,
who is divorced from Mrs. White, also attended the service at the
Second Presbyterian Church.
   Singer Elton John, who had maintained a bedside vigil during
Ryan's final week of life, led the congregation in singing a hymn.
He then accompanied himself as he sang his own composition,
``Skyline Pigeon,'' about a captive bird yearning to be freed.
   Ryan died Sunday of complications from the disease he had fought
for more than five years.
   Probasco noted that many celebrities had befriended the youth
during his struggle with AIDS and his legal battle to attend public
school. He said Ryan's life, like theirs, also was successful.
   ``He helped us to care and to believe that with God's help,
nothing is impossible, even for a kid,'' said the minister, who is
pastor at Center Chapel United Methodist Church in Muncie and has
known the White family for years.
   John, wearing a black sequined hat, served as a pallbearer with
Los Angeles Raiders football player Howie Long, talk-show host Phil
Donahue and three local friends of Ryan: Tommy Hale, Leo Joseph and
John Huffman.
   About 300 of Ryan's schoolmates at Hamilton Heights High School
in Arcadia, 25 miles north of Indianapolis, came by bus to the
funeral, which was carried live by Cable News Network.
   Scores of people were left during the service standing outside
the Gothic-style church, which was filled to capacity, in chilly
wind and rain.
   Members of the school's choir sang ``That's What Friends Are
For.'' Ryan found friendship and acceptance at the school after his
family moved from Kokomo.
   A private burial service was held for the family and close
friends in a cemetery in Cicero, the small town near Arcadia, where
the Whites have lived nearly three years.
   Gov. Evan Bayh ordered flags across Indiana to fly at half-staff
in tribute to the youngster who not only confronted a devastating
disease but helped to educate the world about it.
   Former President Reagan, who with his wife, Nancy, joined Ryan
in the youth's last public appearance two weeks ago in Los Angeles,
remembered him in a newspaper column as a young man of patience and
kindness who did not wallow in self-pity.
   ``Ryan accepted his situation with awe-inspiring courage and
magnanimity. He did not run and hide, and he graciously accepted
the public responsibilities thrust on his young shoulders,'' Reagan
wrote in the tribute published Wednesday on the op-ed page of The
Washington Post.
   Ryan was diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome in
December 1984. He had contracted the disease from tainted blood
products used to treat his hemophilia.
   During the following two years, he and his mother won a court
battle to allow him to attend public school near Kokomo. The
youngster appeared on television talk shows and magazine covers and
at Washington hearings as a spokesman for young sufferers of AIDS.
   In between appearances at star-studded fund-raisers, the
teen-ager tried to lead a normal life by attending classes and
dances, skateboarding and getting his driver's license.
   Hundreds of friends and strangers waited in line Tuesday at the
Flanner &amp; Buchanan Mortuary in suburban Carmel to file past his
open casket. They saw him one last time wearing his faded denim
jacket and reflective sunglasses.
   Visitation continued Wednesday morning at the church, where 300
people were waiting in line when the doors opened.
   ``I'm glad to see that he was so thought of that so many are
here,'' said Gladys Lewis of Indianapolis. ``It shows that somehow
we all learned something from his battle. What he went through, it
brought so many people _ whites, blacks, people of all religions
and ages _ he brought people together.''
   ``It's obviously a very sad day for all of us that knew him and
worked with him,'' said Dr. Woodrow A. Myers at the church. The
former Indiana state health commissioner who supported the Whites'
school battle is now New York City health commissioner.
   ``Ryan really led us all. Here's a kid who was 14 years old who
led the nation by his example,'' Myers said.
   After the funeral, Elton John and Mrs. White issued a statement
thanking the media for ``respectful and sensitive'' coverage of the
death and mourning.
   ``As Ryan understood, the role of the media in educating others
about AIDS is critically important,'' the statement said. ``He
showed us all that we need to devote ourselves to fighting the
disease of AIDS, not those who suffer from it.''

   Five sailors, including a drug testing
supervisor, were charged with using and distributing illegal drugs
aboard a guided missile frigate, authorities said.
   Four other sailors serving on the USS John A. Moore face
administrative sanctions for drug use, Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser said
Tuesday.
   The charges resulted from a seven-month investigation into
allegations that sailors used and distributed marijuana and crystal
methamphetamine, or ``ice,'' Chesser said.
   Chief Master at Arms David Riley, the ship's top law enforcement
officer, was charged with four counts of using methamphetamine, two
counts of using marijuana and ``compromising the command's
urinalysis program,'' Chesser said.
   Petty Officer 1st Class Alden Hendrickson and Operations
Specialist 2nd Class Kevin McPike were charged with use and
distribution of methamphetamine, Chesser said. McPike also was
charged with using marijuana, he said.
   A preliminary hearing on the charges was planned. The three
sailors could face courts-martial, Chesser said.
   Electricians Mates 3rd Class Lonnie Fessler and Thomas Hawley
were charged with one count each of distributing methamphetamine,
he said.
   Hawley and Fessler could be tried by special courts-martial,
which provide less severe penalties upon conviction than general
courts-martial, Chesser said.
   The sailors being dealt with administratively were not
identified.

   More than two dozen people canceled
subscriptions to protest a newspaper's decision to fire two editors
for their leadership roles in an anti-abortion group, the paper's
editor said Wednesday.
   Fairfield Ledger Editor Jan Nierling said she was sorry to lose
the readers and that ``every subscription counts,'' but said the
cancellations had a ``minimal'' economic impact. The independently
owned paper has more than 5,000 daily subscribers.
   ``We had a couple of letters in protest, and we'll print them,''
she said. ``But we also had someone come in last night who renewed
his subscription ... and said he was proud that we did what we felt
we had to do.''
   A few advertisers, including a Christian book store, had pulled
ads, she said.
   ``We had one call back who said, `I apologize, I thought it
through and I realize in business there are some tough decisions to
make,' '' Ms. Nierling said.
   On Monday, the paper fired News Editor John Kennedy and People
Page Editor Terri Lambertsen because they declined to resign from
their positions as secretary and president of a new anti-abortion
group.
   Ms. Nierling said the two violated the paper's policy that
prohibits journalists from taking active positions in groups
subject to news coverage.
   Kennedy said no legal action was planned against the paper, but,
``I'd like to see this be righted. Their action is wrong in our
eyes.''
   He said the Southeast Iowa Pro-Lifers group has not done
anything other than hold an organizational meeting.
   ``My beliefs on abortion are not political views, it's
religious,'' Kennedy said. ``They're my Christian convictions, it's
not some political bent I'm on.
   ``There have been a lot of Christians calling, offering support
and prayers,'' he said. ``That's been very encouraging. And I've
got a lot of support from people who aren't Christians, just on the
principle that it's wrong for a paper to fire people for their
beliefs.''
   Kennedy and Ms. Lambertsen are members of the International
Church of the Four Square Gospel, which encourages members to be
socially active.
   Ms. Nierling said she, too, had received numerous calls of
support.
   She said editors from around Iowa called to say the Ledger made
the right decision.
   ``It was nice to have the supportive phone calls,'' she said.
``They said it was a tough call, that they wouldn't want to be in
my shoes. But they said they'd do the same thing.''

<HEAD>Swede Fights for Right to Fly Native Flag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swedish woman whose flag was
removed from a condominium flagpole says she'll go to court to
fight for the right to fly the banner of her native country.
   Zenta Rowley, who moved to the United States from Sweden five
years ago, hired an attorney after her flag was removed last week
from the community flagpole at Mariner Village.
   ``This is ridiculous. I like my flag and I know my rights,''
said Rowley, who was given the blue-and-yellow banner recently by
friends from Sweden.
   ``What she wants to do is something very patriotic that doesn't
hurt anybody in the neighborhood,'' said her attorney, James Rich.
   The president of the Boynton Mariner Village Homeowners
Association, Mark Ifill, also is seeking advice from a lawyer. He
refused to respond to Rowley's accusation that he was responsible
for the flag's removal.
   The Swedish flag was taken down a few hours after Rowley raised
it on the complex's flagpole, beneath the U.S. flag. Also on the
pole are four nautical flags that signify the village association.
   Rowley said she then collected signatures from 34 of the 36 unit
owners supporting her effort to fly the flag and checked with
Boynton Beach officials to make sure city law doesn't prohibit
display of foreign flags.
   ``We don't have any problems with it _ as long as the American
flag is on top, of course,'' Code Enforcement Administrator Scott
Blasie said.
   But Rowley must get permission from her homeowners association
before the Swedish flag can be flown, said complex manager Gene
Schuler.
   ``It is a shame that you need attorneys for something like this,
but sometimes there is no other choice,'' he said.
   ``If you let the Swedes fly their flags, then you have to do the
same for the Mexicans and Italians, which could lead to a lot of
problems,'' said Schuler.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Former San Antonio Heart Surgeon $28 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has awarded a $28 million libel
judgment to a heart surgeon who claimed a San Antonio television
station ruined his medical practice with stories of allegations
that he performed unnecessary surgery.
   Attorneys for KENS-TV said they likely will appeal Tuesday's
verdict.
   Dr. Sudhir Srivastava filed the lawsuit against KENS-TV and
Harte-Hanks Television in 1985 after the station broadcast a series
of reports alleging that a ring of physicians had performed
unnecessary surgery on elderly patients for profit.
   The jury found that the reports that the doctor had performed
such surgery, based on interviews with relatives of some of his
patients, were false as a whole and had ruined Srivastava's
reputation.
   ``We're elated,'' the doctor, with his wife and two children,
said after the verdict. ``Finally justice came through.''
   ``They saw the truth,'' Srivastava said of the jurors. ``They
saw all the evidence that was there and the facts convinced them.''
   In the series, KENS-TV journalist Ed Gonzalez reported that
Srivastava had lost his privileges to practice at Santa Rosa
Hospital and the Baptist Memorial Hospital System amid claims of
unnecessary surgery.
   The doctor contended the series ruined his San Antonio practice.
His malpractice insurance skyrocketed and he was forced to move to
Midland, where he now practices at a loss, said his lawyer, James
Branton.
   Eleven jurors _ one more than needed to validate the decision in
civil court _ voted to award the doctor $28 million after hearing
two weeks of evidence and deliberating six hours.
   KENS-TV lawyer Mark Cannan said an appeal is likely.
   ``Adverse jury verdicts against the media are not uncommon,''
Cannan said. ``But this is just round one.''
   Branton described Srivastava as a promising young surgeon who
had performed more than 2,000 open-heart surgeries by the end of
1984. He also claimed the station was ``out to get someone'' during
a ratings period.
   KENS-TV stood behind the broadcast, calling it good journalism
on a subject of great public concern.
   Cannan argued that the medical community already knew of
Srivastava's hospital suspensions and, therefore, the doctor's
reputation was damaged before the first KENS-TV story aired.
   He noted the suspensions also were reported in the San Antonio
Express-News the morning before the first broadcast.
   Cannan said the series ran over a period of several days and
Srivastava had an open invitation to appear on the program.
   Dallas lawyer Chip Babcock, who represents the Dallas Times
Herald and KDFW-TV in Dallas, said the verdict is one of the
biggest libel awards against a Texas news organization.
   KENS-TV President and General Manager Michael J. Conly said:
``The verdict relates to a newscast that ran over five years ago.
We are amazed and very disappointed by it.
   ``At the same time, we know media companies frequently lose
verdicts at the jury level, for whatever reasons, but then win on
appeal because the law recognizes the crucial role the media plays
in educating the public and protecting our democratic
institutions,'' Conly said.

   Rival Christian forces exchanged machine
gun and sniper fire Wednesday, killing three people, as civilians
dug caves in mountains to protect themselves in case of renewed
shelling duels.
   The inconclusive showdown between renegade army Gen. Michel Aoun
and Christian warlord Samir Geagea for mastery of the Christian
enclave has left nearly 900 dead since it began on Jan. 30.
   In another development, Shiite Moslem militias allied with Iran
and Syria battled in the ancient town of Baalbek, 53 miles
northeast of Beirut.
   Police said one militiaman of the Syrian-backed mainstream
Shiite Amal militia, and another from the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, were killed in the shootout.
   The two factions have been fighting intermittently for more than
two years for dominance among Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the
largest community in the war-torn nation. The Lebanese civil war
itself is in its 15th year.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said a majority of the 1 million residents of the
Christian enclave have fled the area.
   He said some Christians who could not afford to flee were
digging caves along the rocky slopes of the Kesrouan mountains for
shelter in case of renewed artillery duels.
   At least a dozen caves were under construction in the Bou Mizan
region near the shell-shattered mountain resort of Kleiat, 15 miles
northeast of Beirut.
   Kleiat, well-known for its plush restaurants, nightclubs and
villas, has become a no-man's land with both Aoun's soldiers and
Geagea's fighters repeatedly storming the area to gain control of
the network of narrow mountain roads which it commands.
   ``Most of those digging caves are poor villagers who cannot
afford to rent houses or hotel rooms in other areas,'' the police
spokesman said.
   Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943.

<TEXT>
   Harold Ballard, the colorful and eccentric owner
of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League, died
Wednesday in a Toronto hospital after a long illness. He was 86.
   Ballard died of a combination of factors, including diabetes,
heart problems and kidney and respiratory failure, doctors at
Wellesley Hospital said in a release.
   Ballard's children _ Harold Jr., William and Mary Elizabeth
Flynn _ and his longtime companion, Yolanda Ballard, had visited
him earlier Wednesday.
   ``I was holding his hand,'' said his oldest friend, former
Toronto mayor Allan Lamport, who had visited Ballard just before he
died. ``He squeezed my hand. It showed he understood.''
   His death came months after he abruptly called off a scheduled
marriage on a Caribbean island to Ms. Ballard, 57.
   Ballard, who owned Maple Leafs Gardens and built a fortune
estimated at more than $100 million, reveled in his reputation for
being cantankerous and unabashedly sexist, and his personality
often made more headlines than his team.
   NHL President John Ziegler, whom Ballard once called ``a
know-nothing shrimp,'' said his death marked the end of an era.
``Harold was his own public relations, marketing and promotional
(man), not only manager but performer.''
   In an interview in October, Ballard said: ``I think that every
girl thinks that if she hangs around with a guy that she's going to
be his wife someday. She isn't getting any headway with me.''
   When asked about women sportswriters in the locker room, he
said: ``I told them once, if you want to go in there you can _ but
you've got to take your clothes off too.''
   Ballard called professional hockey players overpaid and often
criticized warmer Soviet relations with the West, particularly on
the ice. He once threatened to bar a Soviet team from his arena for
an exhibition match.
   In 1972, Ballard was convicted of fraud and theft involving
$205,000 in the arena's funds and served one year of a three-year
sentence.
   Ballard spent much of the last two years in and out of hospitals
because of diabetes-related heart problems. In July 1988, he
underwent heart bypass surgery at Toronto General Hospital.
   In January 1988, he had a heart attack while on vacation and
spent almost a month in the Miami Heart Institute. In February
1986, Ballard spent 16 days in the hospital for prostate gland
surgery.
   Perhaps the strangest episode in his soap opera life began in
1982 when he met Yolanda MacMillan, who in 1987 had her last name
legally changed to Ballard in anticipation of a wedding.
   But, on Jan. 3, just hours before the two were to be wed in the
Cayman Islands, Ballard backed out, saying he was not ready for
marriage.
   Hours later, Ballard became ill and had been hospitalized since.
   A judge in Toronto declared Ballard mentally incompetent and
appointed personal and financial guardians.
   William Ballard referred to Ms. Ballard as ``the dragon lady,''
and said she had taken advantage of his father's loneliness while
trying to isolate him from his family.
   She responded: ``They were a long-battling family many, many
years before I came to know Mr. Ballard. It just breaks my heart to
see this kind of discontentment.''
   Ballard was born in Toronto on July 30, 1903, the only son of a
skating company owner. He began in hockey as the owner of a minor
league team. He became vice president of the Maple Leafs in the
1960s and president and governor of the club in 1971. He was
inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1977, the year the Leafs
celebrated their 50th birthday.
   He bought the Hamilton Tigers-Cats of the Canadian Football
League in 1978 and sold it in 1989.
   His wife, Dorothy, died of cancer in 1968.

<HEAD>Safety Board Says Hanford Tanks Pose Little Risk to Public</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hydrogen gas building up inside nuclear
waste storage tanks at the Hanford nuclear reservation poses no
risk to the public, the head of a congressional review group said
Wednesday.
   Two members of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board have
spent the past two days at Hanford, conferring with officials for
the U.S. Department of Energy about the tanks. Experts have said
there is a chance the tanks could explode because of the hydrogen
buildup.
   ``We don't believe there is any kind of risk to the public,''
said John Conway, chairman of the board, in a brief telephone
interview.
   Asked whether the issue has unnecessarily alarmed the public, as
Energy Secretary James Watkins has contended, Conway said, ``The
public has a reason to be concerned, unless it is explained
properly to them.''
   Conway spoke after he and board member Herbert Kouts had eight
hours of briefings from DOE and experts.
   Hanford manager Mike Lawrence announced last month that new
findings indicated hydrogen was building up inside 20 of Hanford's
177 waste storage tanks. He said there was a low risk of the
hydrogen catching fire or exploding.
   Watkins subsequently criticized Lawrence before Congress for
alarming the public over such a low risk.
   Lawrence has said the problem is that hydrogen is trapped under
the hard crust that forms at the top of the wastes, which are
byproducts of the production of plutonium for nuclear weapons.
   Scientists monitoring the wastes have watched them rise as much
as 33 inches in past years, apparently the result of gases building
up under the crust, DOE has said.
   Conway said DOE officials must continue taking precautions to
prevent the tanks from exploding. The Energy Department has stopped
taking wastes in and out of the tanks, and reduced probing
activities to prevent a spark from triggering an explosion.
   ``There are more things they'll have to do,'' Conway said, but
did not elaborate.
   The board needs additional information before making its
recommendations to Watkins, and will visit Hanford again, he said.
   The safety board was set up by Congress last year to monitor
safety at DOE facilities.

   Federal investigators have moved in
after hearing residents of the coastal town of Vega Baja were on a
spending spree, and reportedly found the people had unearthed steel
drums containing millions of dollars, according to a news report
Wednesday.
   The English daily The San Juan Star quoted unidentified sources
as saying the FBI recently recovered one drum filled with $1.5
million, most of it in $20 bills issued in 1985. Ten empty drums
were found nearby.
   FBI spokeswoman Alina Bloom said Wednesday night, ``We are not
giving out any information pending the completion of the
investigation.''
   Vega Baja is a small town 35 miles west of San Juan. Residents
were said to have uncovered about 10 drums packed with cash three
weeks ago and apparently started buying houses, boats, cars and
VCRs like they were going out of style.
   Newspapers reported that suspicious bank officials called
authorities last week after a Vega Baja auto mechanic paid cash for
a $170,000 house and a sports car and deposited $50,000 in cash in
the bank.
   Although it's not known where the steel drum money came from,
speculation was the buried treasure belonged to drug traffickers.
   The FBI was reportedly trying to persuade townsfolk to turn over
the money.
   In Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth, the law states anyone
finding ``treasures'' in private property in the Caribbean island
can keep half of it, with the balance going to the commonwealth.

   A former Internal Revenue Service agent who was
caught in an FBI sting was sentenced Wednesday to 41 months in
federal prison for money laundering.
   U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis warned he would have been
harsher if Ricardo Hawkins, 40, committed the crime while he was
still with the IRS.
   ``This court is severe with people who violate the public
trust,'' he said.
   Defense attorney Richard Sharpstein, noting his client's
contrition, had asked for the minimum 33-month term under
guidelines ranging up to 51 months. Sharpstein promised to appeal.
   Hawkins was arrested last May 24 as he stepped from a plane at
Miami International Airport on a flight from Atlanta, holding
$225,000 given to him by an undercover FBI agent posing as a
cocaine dealer as part of a money-laundering sting.
   Hawkins was living in Marietta, Ga., at the time of his arrest.
He served as an IRS agent in Ohio from 1973 to 1982 and then as
chief deputy sheriff in Stark County, Ohio, until 1984.
   Davis allowed him to remain free on $100,000 personal surety
bond pending his surrender May 11 to a federal prison.

   Lech Walesa denied Wednesday he had
decided to run for president of Poland, and said the campaign that
most concerns him is winning re-election next week as Solidarity
chairman.
   Walesa backed away from remarks attributed to him Tuesday by the
official Polish news agency PAP that indicated he would be a
presidential candidate in the next election.
   ``Today on radio and TV, I hear that Lech Walesa agreed to be
president. I didn't say so at all,'' Walesa protested. ``I simply
did not guard my tongue enough somewhere.''
   Walesa said he had been ``cajoled'' into giving an answer, and
was misunderstood.
   Asked about whether he would run for president, Walesa was
quoted by PAP as replying, ``I confirm.''
   ``We have many wise and valuable people in government, holding
various posts,'' Walesa told PAP. ``However, one must speed up the
pace of reforms and destroy the old arrangements.''
   On Wednesday, Walesa said his ``metaphor'' about running for
president was simply his way of warning the present Solidarity-led
government to work faster in transforming Poland from a communist
to a democratic system.
   Walesa expressed concern that a premature presidential bid might
cost him support among Solidarity activists who will be electing a
chairman next week when the once-outlawed union holds its first
congress in nine years.
   ``Now we have the union elections, and a lot of activists will
say I would vote for you but if you want to jump from the union to
the presidency, I will not vote,'' Walesa said, speaking to
reporters during a visit to his Gdansk union headquarters by
Czechoslovak Deputy Premier Jan Carnogursky.
   ``By this false start, I can lose the basic things,'' he said,
referring to the union chairmanship. Walesa faces a challenge from
a Solidarity faction that feels the union has strayed too far from
its founding ideals of 1980 by putting politics ahead of trade
union goals defending workers' interests.
   Despite his denials, however, other politicians showed little
doubt Wednesday that Walesa eventually intends to seek the
presidency.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski's six-year term is not due to end
until 1995, but there is a strong possibility the election will be
moved up as part of a general overhaul of the Polish Constitution.
   ``The fact that Walesa intends to run for president of the
Polish Republic is not a surprise for me,'' said Labor Party leader
Wladyslaw Sila-Nowicki in Wednesday's edition of the government
newspaper Rzeczpospolita.
   The retreat from a declaration of candidacy was vintage Walesa,
who typically is circumspect in discussing his political moves and
often makes seemingly contradictory statements.
   One close adviser to Walesa, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Solidarity leader is now biding his time regarding the
presidency.
   ``After the (union) congress, we will launch the battle with a
firm hand,'' the adviser said.
   There was no immediate comment from Jaruzelski or his aides
about a potential Walesa presidential bid.
   Jaruzelski, who began a trip Wednesday to the Soviet Union, was
elected president by parliament last July with Solidarity's passive
assistance despite leading the 1981 martial law crackdown that
suppressed the union. Jaruzelski resigned as Communist Party leader
shortly after assuming the presidency.
   But at a time when the old Communist leaders have been swept
away throughout Eastern Europe, many Solidarity activists are upset
Jaruzelski remains president.
   The discussion of a presidential bid by Walesa also brings into
focus his growing differences with the government of Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, a union adviser who became the East bloc's first
non-communist prime minister last August.
   Walesa has accused the government of acting too slowly to
privatize the state economy and remove the old Communist elite from
positions of influence in factories and local governments.
   Reiterating his criticism, Walesa told reporters Wednesday that
despite Solidarity's achievements since its founding, there are
still too few practical improvements in people's lives.
   ``There has been a victory, but no use is being made of this
victory,'' Walesa said.

<TEXT>
   A jury on Wednesday found a convict
guilty of murdering his ex-wife while free on a prison furlough.
   Alan L. Matheney, 39, could receive the death penalty for the
1989 beating death of Lisa M. Bianco. The jury was to return to
court Thursday to decide whether Matheney should be executed or go
to prison.
   The jury rejected Matheney's insanity defense in convicting him
of murder and burglary after nearly seven hours of deliberations.
   Matheney listened impassively to the verdict, chewing gum as he
stood at the defense table with his hands folded in front of him.
Moments later, bailiffs and sheriff's deputies led him from the
courtroom.
   The victim's father, Eugene Bianco, listened quietly to the
verdict, then wept as a prosecutor's assistant came up to hug him.
He declined to comment on the conviction.
   Before deliberations began, the judge told jurors they could
find Matheney guilty, innocent, not responsible by reason of
insanity or guilty but mentally ill.
   The judge and jury were brought to South Bend for the trial from
Lake County to the west in a change of venue.
   In closing arguments, the prosecution described Matheney as a
methodical killer trying to manipulate the courts by pleading
insanity.
   ``There's no evidence whatsover on the insanity issue,'' St.
Joseph County deputy prosecutor John D. Krisor said. ``And he was
able to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct on March 4,
1989.''
   Matheney received an eight-hour furlough that day from the
Indiana Reformatory near Indianapolis and drove to the South Bend
suburb of Mishawaka, where he broke into Ms. Bianco's home, chased
her outside and beat her to death, prosecutors say.
   Matheney had been serving an eight-year term for a 1987 assault
of Ms. Bianco.
   In his closing argument, defense attorney Scott L. King repeated
a concession to the jury that Matheney killed the 29-year-old
woman. ``This defense never, never sugar-coated anything to you,''
he said.
   King attacked the state's evidence on the burglary charge _ a
key element in the prosecution's attempt to seek the death penalty.
   He attacked the credibility of Matheney's fellow inmates who
testified he talked of killing Ms. Bianco if he received a
furlough, suggesting the inmates might have lied in exchange for
lenient treatment. He contended the prosecution failed to prove
Matheney entered Ms. Bianco's home intending to kill her.
   King asked the jurors to consider ``all the evidence.''
   The evidence included psychiatric testimony that Matheney has

<HEAD>New Name of Country Approved by Parliament's Leadership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament's leadership has
tentatively approved another version of the country's name in an
effort to defuse ethnic tensions, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Protests broke out in the Slovak capital of Bratislava following
the renaming of the country on March 23 to the ``Czechoslovak
Federative Republic.''
   The Svobodne Slovo daily newspaper said the new name for the
country approved by Parliament leaders would be ``Czech and Slovak
Federative Republic.''
   The proposal is to be discussed at Parliament's next session
Wednesday in hopes of resolving the most bitter controversy in the
new legislature.
   In January, reflecting the end of four decades of hard-line
Communist rule, new President Vaclav Havel proposed to drop the
word ``socialist'' from the name ``Czechoslovak Socialist
Republic'' to symbolize the country's departure from its Communist
past.
   Slovaks, representing one third of the country's population and
feeling belittled by the more affluent Czechs, seized the
opportunity to demand that their own identity be specified in the
country's new name.
   Parliament, in renaming the country March 23, allowed the
Slovaks to spell their version of the country's name with a hyphen,
Czecho-Slovak.
   This compromise solution, pushed through Parliament by Havel,
also fell short of the Slovaks' expectations.
   Thousands of separatists have demonstrated in Bratislava,
protesting against the new name and demanding an independent Slovak
state.
   Havel called a meeting Friday of the country's Czech and Slovak
leaders in a last-ditch effort to find a name acceptable to all
parties.
   ``The parliamentary presidium is of the opinion that the current
name of the state can only be used with difficulties and recommends
its alteration,'' Svobodne Slovo quoted from a statement issued by
Parliament leaders.
   The Parliament, bogged down in passing dozens of laws needed for
the transition of its economy from the Stalinist model to
free-market mechanisms, will lose its mandate April 19. Elections
are June 8-9.

   Burmese warplanes bombed the
headquarters of ethnic Karen rebels and sent ground troops in an
apparent attempt to capture the base, military sources said
Wednesday.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said four
warplanes attacked the Manerplaw headquarters Monday and Tuesday
but inflicted only minor damage. There was no report on casualties.
   Manerplaw, at the Thai-Burmese border about 120 miles northeast
of the Burmese capital Rangoon, is the seat of the Karen National
Union. It is one of 12 ethnic minority rebel groups fighting the
central Burmese government for greater autonomy.
   The Karen National Union, which fields about 4,000 fighters, has
lost nearly all its major bases the past year as the Burmese army
has made a major push to control the frontier.
   Details of the move against Manerplaw were not available, and
the central Karen command could not be reached from Bangkok.

   The Cabinet was warned Wednesday of a
new plot by military opponents of President Corazon Aquino.
   Rumors of a coup attempt before Easter have swept the capital
for weeks. Manila newspapers quoted intelligence sources as saying
renegade leaders of the abortive December coup have stepped up
recruiting in military camps in preparation for a new strike.
   Rep. Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of Representatives, told
reporters that military officials briefed Cabinet members about
``the report of yet another coup d'etat.''
   ``The Cabinet was given assurance that ... they (will) take
immediate and decisive action if there is any indication of another
coup attempt,'' he said.
   Vice Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon said he did not
expect a new coup attempt on the scale of the Dec. 1-9 failed
putsch, in which 113 people were killed and more than 600 injured.
But he said renegade soldiers may launch ``pocket rebellions'' in
remote areas of the country.
   National Security Adviser Rafael Ileto, a retired general, said
military dissidents may stage attacks to heighten the electricity
crisis in Manila and surrounding Luzon Island.
   The 8 million residents of metropolitan Manila have been coping
with daily power outages because of lack of generating equipment
and a drought.
   In Washington, the State Department meanwhile urged Americans to
be on guard against terrorism during Easter week.
   The source of the danger was not specified, but the Communist
rebel New People's Army has threatened Americans it says are
involved in counter-insurgency here.

   The Census Bureau is now uncertain whether 70
percent of Americans will return their census forms as it had
hoped, a spokesman said Wednesday night.
   ``Fifty-five percent is today's figure (for forms returned) and
we're still hoping people will get them in,'' said the spokesman,
John Scholzen.
   As for the 70 percent target, ``Whether we'll make it or not I
can't say right now,'' Scholzen said.
   On April 26, the bureau will send enumerators to interview
members of households from which forms have not been received. In
some cases, the enumerators will find that homes have been torn
down or are temporarily vacant.
   For each percentage point below 70 in the response rate, the
Census Bureau has estimated to Congress it will have to spend $10
million for extra interviewers.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Majority shares in the famed French couture house
of Jean-Louis Scherrer have been taken over by a Franco-Japanese
coalition, Scherrer announced at a press conference Wednesday.
   The new holding company will be controlled by the Japanese
Seibu-Saison group. Seibu, a major Japanese conglomerate, controls
65 percent of the company, with the balance owned by Hermes, the
French luxury leather firm.
   Seibu has holdings in retail stores, railroads and insurance in
Japan.
   ``We don't like to call this a takeover, but an association,''
said Utako Kimura, a spokesmam for Seibu. The group will be run by
Kuniko Tsutsumi, president of Seibu's operations in France.
   The Japanese-French team now owns 76.5 percent of the Scherrer
group, including the couture, ``boutique'' and ready-to-wear lines.
   Scherrer retains 13.5 percent of the capital, and the French
Financiere division of the Worms et Cie. banking group has a 10
percent share in the new association.
   Scherrer, 54, is well-known in haute couture circles, having won
the ``Golden Thimble'' prize in 1980, plus several other honors.
   ``Scherrer will maintain control of the creative side of his
business,'' said Miss Kimura. She said Scherrer's perfumes are
still controlled through a separate licensing agreement with
Unilever.
   Starting in the fashion business as an assistant at Christian
Dior in 1956, Scherrer founded his own couture house in 1962.
   He is known for ultra-sophisticated clothes in luxury fabrics,
often concentrating on strong themes like wild-animal prints and
Maharajah-style Eastern Indian opulence.
   Scherrer himself could not be reached for comment. But Miss
Kimura of Seibu said that ``Scherrer himself wanted this
association. He has run a very financially stable business.''
   She noted that with the backing of Seibu and the prestigious
Hermes, new shops could be opened, and the worldwide promotion of
Scherrer's creations could proceed on a firm financial basis.

   State officials are starting a $28.6
million ad campaign, financed by a tax on cigarettes, that they
hope will convince three-quarters of California's smokers to kick
the habit by the year 2000.
   Beginning today, ads with some of the strongest language ever
used to attack smoking and tobacco companies will appear on
television, radio, in newspapers and on billboards throughout the
state, said Dr. Kenneth Kizer, head of the state Department of
Health Services.
   The money for the effort is coming from a 25-cent per pack tax
hike authorized under Proposition 99, a referendum passed last
year. That brought the total state tax to 35 cents a pack.
   The TV commercials are aimed especially at youths, pregnant
women and minorities. They sharply condemn the way tobacco
companies sell their products.

   The mind's power over the body enables many
people to keep death at bay while waiting for occasions that are
important to them, say researchers who documented the phenomenon
among thousands of subjects.
   The researchers found marked drops in death rates among Jewish
men before Passover and among elderly Chinese women before the
Harvest Moon Festival, said a report in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   ``The results suggest quite strongly that some people are able
to postpone death briefly in order to reach an occasion which is
psychologically significant to them,'' said lead researcher David
P. Phillips, a sociology professor.
   ``In the case of the Chinese, there was a drop of 35 percent in
the mortality before the holiday,'' he said in an interview Tuesday
from the University of California at San Diego in La Jolla. ``There
was a peak in deaths of 35 percent the week after, over what would
normally be expected.''

   Pilots are complaining about air safety

   The Air Line Pilots Association announced Tuesday that air space
over Charlotte, N.C.; Cleveland, Dallas-Fort Worth, Los Angeles,
Memphis, Philadelphia and Phoenix has been added to the
international ``black star'' list of airports and air space that
could pose problems for pilots.
   Only one other U.S. site is among 24 locations on the list _ the
Cyril E. King International Airport in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin
Islands. Surrounding terrain requires special training and no night
flights, according to pilot groups.
   ALPA announced the designations after the International
Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations added the seven U.S. air
spaces to its list.

defection of two religious lawmakers Wednesday spoiled his
immediate hopes of becoming prime minister.
   Shouting matches erupted in Parliament after attempts to form a
new government failed. The breakdown renewed anger in Israel over
the disproportionate influence of small right-wing religious
parties, which serve as kingmakers in any attempt to form a
governing coalition.
   ``Whoever says this is democracy is speaking nonsense,'' said
Amnon Rubinstein of the left-wing Shinui Party. ``We can't continue
with this method.''
   President Chaim Herzog granted Peres 15 more days to pull
together a government. Peres has vowed to make peace negotiations

   Doctors at the nation's largest chain of walk-in
clinics performed about 20 percent more tests and X-rays after the
owners began letting them keep part of the fees their patients
paid, a study found.
   The study implies that whether or not a sick person receives a
test or a procedure can depend on what the doctor makes, rather
than strictly what the patient needs.
   While this conflict of interest may influence care at many
levels of medicine, the latest study focused on storefront walk-in
clinics, which often pay their doctors a percentage of their
patients' total bills.
   Some critics contend this system gives doctors a financial
incentive to perform more tests and X-rays. If this is the
intention, the study suggests that it works: Doctors subjected
their patients to more tests and other care when they personally
profited from the extra care.

<TEXT>
   C.T. Wu is back in Taiwan, leaving behind
in the United States a promising career with leading companies, an
$800,000 home in Maryland and a lifestyle he adored.
   He gave it up to start his own high-technology company at the
Science-Based Industrial Park in this gritty city about 45 miles
southwest of Taipei. Wu and hundreds of other returning
professionals are helping extend Taiwan's economic miracle into the
21st century.
   Wu, 36, lived the American dream during 11 years in the United
States, receiving a doctorate in communications and winning GTE's
highest technical achievement award for his work in satellites.
   In 1988, he decided to return to Taiwan because lower labor
costs and easier access to capital would help him start his own
communications business.
   ``I'm an entrepreneur at heart,'' Wu explained in the bare
offices of his 6-month-old company, National Datacomm Corp., at the
industrial park.
   Among other fledgling entrepreneurs in the park is Henry H. Sun,
chairman of 1{-year-old Coast Hitech Corp. It produces microwave
components for radar and missiles.
   Sun, 57, said he worked for ITT Corp. in space defense before
setting up Coast Hitech with two partners who also came from the
United States.
   He and the others view the company, in part, as a way to pass on
their ``knowledge and experience to the people in Taiwan,'' Sun
said.
   The government-run science park, established a decade ago,
entices entrepreneurs with tax holidays, duty exemptions and other
incentives.
   It has several representatives overseas, including one in the
heart of California's ``Silicon Valley,'' to help persuade Taiwan's
brightest to return home.
   More than half the 1,000 people with graduate degrees who work
in the science park formerly lived abroad. Klaus C. Wiemer,
president of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., said he
employs about 50 Taiwanese recruited from the United States.
   ``If it becomes known that I'm looking for a particular person
like a quality control manager, than it's only a matter of weeks
before the resumes start rolling in by fax,'' he said.
   Wiemer, an American citizen whose company is a joint venture of
the government and N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, said
professionals were returning to Taiwan for several reasons.
   Technology in the most advanced companies finally is reaching
levels comparable to that of U.S. firms, so challenging jobs can
now be found for top engineers, he said.
   Initial salaries in Taiwan may be relatively low, but returning
professionals can make a lot of money by acquiring stock in their
new companies before they go public.
   He also noted that ``Chinese are family oriented, so many of the
people who left 10 to 20 years ago see their parents getting very
old and now they want to come back and be close.''
   The homeward flow of talent is critical to the further
development of Taiwan, an export-oriented powerhouse that is
finding many of its low-skill manufacturing industries no longer
can compete with neighboring Asian countries that offer cheaper
land and labor.
   Experts say Taiwan soon will become the world's fourth-largest
manufacturer of semiconductors. Among more than 100 companies in
the science park are 25 semiconductor firms and more than 30 others
involved in computer technology.
   The number of Taiwanese returning represents a fraction of the
bright ones who go abroad. An average of 6,500 students leave for
American universities annually and statistics indicate more than
half stay in the United States, the Education Ministry said..
   A diplomat at the U.S. mission in Taipei said U.S. officials
were not worried about highly skilled Taiwanese leaving American
companies.
   Wiemer said the drain of some top talent back to Taiwan,
particularly given the intense global competition in high-tech
industries, ``certainly is going to hurt'' the United States, ``but
at least the outflow is to a friendly nation.''
   Many who have returned complain about the island's increasing
crime, deteriorating environment and turbulent society, so one of
the government's most difficult tasks may be to keep them from
going abroad once again.
   ``It's been very hard to adjust to life here,'' Wu said. Is he
glad to be back? ``Not really.''
   Sun wants to retire in the United States, where his wife and
children still live, and Wu also plans to go back after five or six
years.
   ``Mentality-wise, I'm 100 percent American,'' said Wu, who
prominently displays in his office a hand-drawn flag his colleagues
gave him when he became a U.S. citizen. ``I feel home when I'm back
in the United States.''

   In a world of mostly white shows, mostly
white producers and mostly white advertisers, ``In Living Color''
promises to stick out like a raisin in a bowl of rice.
   Because almost the entire cast is black? Partly. Mostly, it's
because of the show's black humor.
   Fox Television likes to pride itself on ``pushing the
envelope,'' as Tom Wolfe's astronauts in ``The Right Stuff'' put
it. But is the alternative network ready for warp speed?
   Make that warped speed.
   Consider the sketches already in the can for this black version
of ``Saturday Night Live,'' which debuts Sunday after Fox's
top-rated ``Married ... With Children.'' There's the ``Homeboy
Shopping Network,'' in which two black men unload a semitruck full
of very hot items, including a satellite dish with ``NASA''
emblazoned on its face.
   ``Not only do you get all the stations out there,'' promises one
of the jive-talking hosts, ``you can talk directly to the
astronauts.''
   There's also ``Men on Film,'' featuring two gay, black movie
reviewers spoofing Siskel and Ebert. Spike Lee's ``Do The Right
Thing'' gets a limp-wristed ``two snaps up'' from the fey duo.
   Sandwiched between the skits, a la ``Saturday Night Live,'' are
fake commercials. Calvin Klein's ``Obsession'' becomes ``Oppression
_ for black men. If only he wasn't so dark.''
   A takeoff on the United Negro College Fund's motto admonishes
young blacks to ``Keep Your Butt in School.''
   Wait a minute. Is it OK to laugh at this stuff? Doesn't it
perpetuate black stereotypes? Isn't it exploitative?
   Oh, get over it, says Keenen Ivory Wayans, the 31-year-old
executive producer-writer-cast member of ``In Living Color.''
   ``Black people aren't supposed to be funny? Woody Allen's Jewish
and he makes fun of Jews,'' says Wayans. ``No one's ever accused
him of being anti-Semitic.''
   If Wayan's brand of black parody sounds familiar, it's because
he's the same person who starred in and co-wrote ``Hollywood
Shuffle'' and made his directing debut in ``I'm Gonna Git You
Sucka.'' The latter has grossed more than $19 million since its
1988 release.
   He pals around with guys like Lee, Arsenio Hall, Eddie Murphy
and Robert Townsend, with whom he made ``Hollywood Shuffle.''
   Wayans is a hot property right now and he knows it. ``In Living
Color'' was not a show he shopped around to the networks. Fox came
to him. And gave him carte blanche.
   ``They basically said you can do whatever you want to,'' Wayans
says while sitting in Fox's Hollywood offices. ``If you have a
chance to do something that will have some impact, you do it.''
   To do ``In Living Color'' _ which unlike ``Saturday Night Live''
is being taped in advance _ Wayans enlisted almost half his
10-member family.
   Sister Kim and brothers Damon and Shawn will be regulars on the
show. A nationwide search was launched for the rest of the ensemble
cast of comedians. Two former writers from David Letterman's show
were hired.
   On its end, Fox signed up for eight half-hour episodes, gave it
a prestigious time slot and is promoting the daylights out of it.
   Still, Fox executives are more than a bit nervous about the
show's content.
   ``But it's good nervous,'' says 29-year-old Damon, who stars in
the ``Homeboy Shopping Network'' segment alongside Keenen.
   ``There is a concern, but we trust our producers,'' says Brad
Turell, a senior vice president of Fox Broadcasting Co. ``We think
this show is going to be a big hit. It's very funny.''
   And not racist, say Turell and Wayans. ``I'm just telling
jokes,'' Wayans says. There's no big message behind it and no plan
to change the world.
   ``Nothing in the medium of entertainment changes people. The
only thing that changes people is government and laws. What I want
to do is make America and the entertainment industry accept blacks
in a different format.''

<HEAD>The Rock 'n' Roll Musical That Toppled ``Miss Saigon''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Can't get into ``Miss Saigon''? Already seen
``Aspects of Love'' on Broadway? Musical devotees in London have
another option _ a sci-fi Shakespeare spoof now rocking 'n' rolling
to an award-winning beat.
   ``Return to the Forbidden Planet,'' with its collegiate good
humor and inspired silliness, recently won London's equivalent of
the Tony Award as the year's best musical, beating the heavyweight
favorite ``Miss Saigon.''
   Who would have thought the spunky show could accomplish such a
feat? Certainly not Bob Carlton, the musical's writer-director.
   ``I didn't think we had a chance in the world,'' the 39-year-old
Carlton said in an interview. ``As a company, we were just pleased
to be nominated. That was our Cup Final or Rose Bowl.
   ``It's taken us all by surprise.''
   Playing at the Cambridge Theater, ``Return to the Forbidden
Planet'' is based on the campy 1956 movie ``Forbidden Planet.''
Starring Walter Pidgeon, Leslie Nielsen and Anne Francis, the
movie's plot was derived from Shakespeare's ``The Tempest,'' and
involves a space-age Prospero who creates monsters from his own id.
   The characters in the musical include the ``chisel-jawed''
Captain Tempest; Dr. Prospero, the scientist; and Miranda, his
daughter, described in the program as ``would-be homecoming queen
and virgin.'' While they set off for the planet D'Illyria, the
theater shakes to such songs as ``Monster Mash,'' ``Great Balls of
Fire'' and ``Only the Lonely.''
   Not exactly the stuff from which awards are won _ or so Carlton
thought, until April 8 when the 14th annual Laurence Olivier
awards, honoring achievement in theater, dance and opera, were
announced.
   Producer Andre Ptaszynski said his show benefited from what
might be called its unpredictability factor. ``The element of
surprise always works, if you can deliver the goods,'' he said.
   ``You know what you're going to see with `Miss Saigon,''' he
said of the musical about the Vietnam War, which opens on Broadway
next April, ``a grand show one step on from `Les Miserables.'''
   But ``Forbidden Planet,'' he said, ``catches people off
balance.''
   Carlton said its appeal also lay in the populism of the show, a
show regarded by many as ``a party.''
   ``I've been saying for quite a long time that it's a people's
show, and I think that's what did it for us in the end,'' he said.
The Olivier prizes are conferred by a panel that mixes industry
professionals and members of the general public.
   Critical response has been varied. The Spectator, London's
high-brow weekly magazine, didn't bother to review it. Time Out,
the determinedly hip listings magazine, called it ``tacky, wacky
and very loud. Wear earplugs and be prepared to dance in the
aisles.''
   The win vindicates Ptaszynski's faith in the musical, which he
first optioned during its 1986 run at the ``fringe'' Tricycle
Theater in northwest London.
   Budgeted at about $490,000, the West End production lost $16,300
to $24,450 a week during its first two months at the 1,300-seat
Cambridge Theater, Ptaszynski said.
   He said it has not had a losing week since the end of November,
and is now playing to 80 percent capacity _ twice the 40 percent
needed to break even.
   The advance sale is about $490,000, a figure Ptaszynski said is
``one nought (zero) less than that for `Miss Saigon.''' That show,
which is as large-scale and complex as ``Forbidden Planet'' is
small-scale and unpretentious, cost $5.7 million to produce,
according to producer Cameron Mackintosh.
   Ptaszynski said there was interest in taking ``Forbidden
Planet'' to Australia and Japan as well as Broadway and Los
Angeles. But as he looks toward a fall 1991, New York opening, he
warned against overhyping the show in advance.
   ``I'd rather America discovered the show rather than blazing in
as the musical that beat `Miss Saigon,''' he said. ``We'd like to
get it through Ellis Island quietly.''

<HEAD>Christians Confess Guilt for Crucifixion, But It's Blurred in
History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Christians on Good Friday mark the crucifixion of Jesus, a man
regarded as manifesting God on Earth. Through twists of history,
his death has been blamed variously on fellow Jews, Romans, a
combination of both.
   A noted professor of ancient history, Paul L. Maier, says it is
``beyond debate'' that the Roman governor Pilate delivered the
execution verdict, and bears the final legal responsibility.
   Theologically, however, Christians themselves in recalling that
event acknowledge that their own sinful failings brought about the
crucifixion, necessitating it to redeem humanity.
   They were involved. They ``were there,'' a hymn for the day's
services goes. Only through that confessed participation in the
wrong do they find forgiveness for it through Jesus' suffering on
the cross.
   It's regarded as the ``atonement,'' the laying down of a sinless
life to make amends for universal offenses against that goodness.
In that purpose, ``God so loved the world that he gave his only
Son,'' Scripture says.
   The day is called ``Good Friday'' because the crucifixion is
seen as absorbing the results of human wrongs in God himself, thus
providing his pardon from them, his grace.
   It is the great saving act in the belief of Christians, the
essential key to their ultimate salvation. For them, it is a
topmost good.
   Despite that basic theology, however, various slants,
contentions and distortions about Jesus' death have sometimes made
it a bitter legacy.
   ``Probably no issue in the history of religion has elicited more
blind partisanship, misinterpretation, faulty logic, hostility or
fad following,'' Maier writes.
   The ``pendulum has swung from one illogical _ indeed, ridiculous
_ concept to another, from assuming Jewish generic involvement to
arguing for no involvement at all,'' he writes in the April 9 issue
of the evangelical fortnightly, Christianity Today.
   Maier, who teaches ancient history at Western Michigan
University and who has written several books about first century
Judaism of which Jesus was a part, says the early church often bent
Scripture to blame Jesus' fellow Jews.
   That notion of ``Jewish collective responsibility'' for the
crucifixion had ``horrifying results'' through the centuries _
ghettoization, pogroms, the Inquisition, centuries of
anti-Semitism, the Nazi holocaust, Maier says.
   Past labeling of Jews as ``Christ killers'' was ``illogical,
unethical and misinterprets the Gospels,'' Maier says. That
falsehood has been repudiated by almost all churches, including the
World Council of Churches and Roman Catholicism's Second Vatican
Council.
   However, he says that in trying to atone for the past, it's
become ``high theological fashion to argue that no Jews were
involved on Good Friday in the manner set forth'' in the Gospels.
   These arguments blame only Pilate, but to deny any Jewish
participation ``flies in the face of historical fact,'' including
traditions in the ancient non-biblical Jewish sources, Maier writes.
   He says opposition to Jesus of the Jewish religious rulers, led
by the high priest, is confirmed by the ancient Jewish historian
Josephus' account of their later plotting the death of Jesus'
kinsman, James.
   ``Certainly Jesus had his Jewish opponents,'' Maier says, and
doubtlessly there was a group shouting ``Crucify,'' but that
``claque seems to have been primarly a throng from the temple _ a
group perfectly orchestrated by Jesus' priestly adversaries...''
   ``But Jesus also had his Jewish friends and supporters on Good
Friday, and not just the timid 12 disciples,'' Maier says, citing
the massive adulation he received on Palm Sunday and other
occasions.
   ``Thousands of Jewish Passover pilgrims must also have remained
loyal to him,'' Maier says, but most of the pro-Jesus Jews ``failed
to learn of his arrest, hearings and trial until it was too late.
   ``He was arrested after many had retired for the night on
Thursday and he stood trial at dawn the next morning,'' Maier says.
That early morning camouflage was arranged by Pilate apparently to
avoid an uprising.
   However, Maier contends that past misinterpretations should not
justify ``tampering with the scriptural sources. ... Secular
historical records of the first century support the New Testament
records,'' he says.
   However, he says Christians should always identify generalizing
of ``the Jews'' in John's Gospel as meaning Jesus' Jewish
opponents, never Jews in general.
   But that doesn't mean John's Gospel is anti-Semitic, Maier says,
noting that the Josephus also often refers to his opponents simply
as ``the Jews'' without intending to generalize.

<HEAD>Congress Sending Get-Tough Message to Gorbachev</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the struggle over Lithuanian secession,
get-tough pressure from Congress sends Moscow a signal that
President Bush has purposefully muted.
   That relayed message is blunt: if President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
clamps down more harshly on Lithuania, Bush will have no political
alternative but to retaliate diplomatically. And their May 30
summit meeting in Washington is hostage to Soviet forbearance.
   Both presidents have to guard their political flanks against
hard-liners. Gorbachev faces Soviet conservatives who want him to
crack down hard on Lithuania. Bush has heard demands from the ranks
in both political parties for economic and diplomatic measures to
support the breakaway Baltic state and punish Moscow for what it
already has done to bar secession.
   The hard-line pressures on Gorbachev were underscored Monday
when about 300 conservative members of the Supreme Soviet told him
he should retroactively annul the parliamentary elections that led
to Lithuania's March 11 declaration of independence, and dissolve
the Lithuanian parliament.
   Another warning came from the 16-member presidential council
headed by Gorbachev, which was said to have decided that
``additional economic, political and other measures'' should be
taken to unless the independence declaration is rescinded in favor
of the slow, tortuous process the Soviet constitution sets for
secession. The threatened steps were not specified.
   Gorbachev eased up a bit on Tuesday, saying he still hopes to
work out a solution and would decree presidential rule only as an
extreme measure in case of civil conflict.
   ``I would just appeal to all sides and anyone with any influence
to encourage dialogue and discussion,'' Bush said Tuesday night in
Toronto, repeating his warning against the use of force.
   The White House has a rule of silence on steps and counter-steps
in the Lithuanian crisis, all in keeping with the president's
effort to calm the controversy, here as well as there.
   Hard-line demands that Gorbachev put down the secessionists
sometimes seem to serve a tactical purpose for the Soviet
president, echoing in Washington as warnings that if he bends too
far on Lithuania, he could be undercut or even pushed from power.
   Conservative Republicans have suggested that if Gorbachev is
that fragile, the administration may be wagering too much on him.
The Bush course seems more attuned to the advice of Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., who saw Gorbachev in Moscow late last month and
returned to counsel caution in Washington.
   Bush and Kennedy discussed the visit. The president sent
Gorbachev a letter said to have reiterated his support for the
right to self-determination in Lithuania and his urging that the
secession controversy be settled without force, through peaceful
negotiations.
   ``I want to be sure that the Soviets understand our position and
understand that we're not trying to make things difficult for
Lithuania or the Soviet Union or anybody else,'' Bush said.
   Congressional leaders in both parties have endorsed the
cautious, measured Bush approach. But it is clear that a crackdown
involving Soviet force would undo that, and a lot more. All bets
would be off, said Seate Republican Leader Bob Dole.
   The first casualty in an escalated crackdown would be a new
trade agreement with preferences Moscow seeks. The administration
is trying to get one ready for the Bush-Gorbachev summit scheduled
in seven weeks; the meeting itself would be at risk should the
Soviets clamp down hard.
   But there already are suggestions in Congress that what Moscow
already has done against Lithuanian secession should derail a trade
deal until the unequal struggle is settled peacefully and on terms
giving Lithuanians their independence.
   Thirty-one senators signed a letter to Bush last week, saying
the United States should take a stronger stand for Lithuanian
independence. ``Now is the time to inform the Soviet leadership
what specific actions our government may take in response to the
further use of armed force in Lithuania,'' they argued.
   While the heaviest pressure comes from the Republican right,
there are Democrats on the case, too, arguing for sterner steps to
free Lithuania from the Soviet rule decreed by Hitler and Stalin 50
years ago.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., tried to have the Senate urge Bush to
extend immediate diplomatic recognition to the government of
Lithuania; that was rejected 59-36. A day later, on March 22, the
Senate voted 95-0 for a toned-down version warning against Soviet
force and asking Bush to consider recognition.
   The House passed a similar resolution April 4, saying that the
president should normalize diplomatic relations as soon as possible.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said that in isolating and trying to
intimidate Lithuania the Soviets already have taken steps ``that
very much resemble martial law.'' He warned that the improving
trend in East-West relations could be at risk.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., made his show-and-tell trip to a
Polish border crossing into Lithuania to be, predictably, turned
back for lack of a Soviet visa.
   That harsher line in Congress makes the point Bush is not
making, at least not publicly: his cautious, conciliatory handling
of Gorbachev's dilemma could not withstand a crackdown in Lithuania.

   Some people like them plain. Some people
like them peanut. And some people never eat the brown ones.
   Fifty years after Forrest Mars first coated a drop of chocolate
with a colorful sugar shell, just how do his successors like their
M&amp;M's?
   John and Forrest Mars Jr., who inherited the privately held
M&amp;M-Mars from their father in 1973, aren't saying. They never give
interviews. But it's a safe bet they like them all just fine, what
with 100 million of the ubiquitous sweets rolling out of their
Hackettstown plant every day and the profits _ nobody's saying how
much _ rolling in.
   Half a century after the elder Forrest decided chocolate lovers
should be able to indulge their sweet-teeth without creating a
gooey mess, M&amp;M's still are holding up in hot little hands across
the world and out in space.
   ``Our consumers are telling us they're being enjoyed,'' M&amp;M-Mars
spokeswoman Mary Ellen Dougherty said. ``They eat them and their
children eat them and their children's children eat them.''
   M&amp;M's were packed in World War II GI rations, served at the 1984
Olympics in Los Angeles and launched with 31 shuttle flights. The
rock band Van Halen's contract calls for a backstage stash of three
pounds of M&amp;M's _ with all the brown and tan ones removed.
   There's more to the modern M&amp;M than shades of sienna, however.
They come in red and white with hearts for Valentine's Day, green
and red stamped with bells, candles or trees for Christmas, and in
pastel colors for Easter.
   The candy empire that produces all these varieties began in 1911
with Frank C. Mars' small business in Tacoma, Wash. In 1940, his
son, Forrest, devised a candy modeled after a British confection: a
circle of chocolate covered with a crunchy coating.
   M&amp;M's were born, as much out of meteorological necessity as
anything.
   ``In those days, the stores didn't have air conditioning, the
cars didn't have air conditioning, the homes didn't have air
conditioning,'' M&amp;M-Mars spokesman Hans Fiuczynski said.
   The candy, originally sold in paper tubes, came in brown,
yellow, orange, red, green and violet, later replaced by tan.
Although never patented, each M&amp;M beginning in 1950 was stamped
with the trademark ``M'' to assure customers they were getting the
real thing.
   Peanut M&amp;M's, at first available only in brown, were introduced
in 1954, and colored peanut candies came along six years later.
   It was during those years that M&amp;M Ltd. settled in Hackettstown,
a burgeoning rural community amid the hills and farms of
northwestern New Jersey.
   Since then, M&amp;M's have survived not only the heat of summer, but
controversy and candy-coated corporate challenges.
   In 1982, university student Paul Hethmon founded the now-defunct
Society for the Restoration and Preservation of Red M&amp;M's, whose
500 members flooded the company with letters demanding the return
of the reds.
   The company had discontinued them in 1976 because of the cancer
scare over Red Dye No. 2, although the candy never contained the
substance.
   Red M&amp;M's reappeared in 1987, the same year the company dodged a
challenge by Lotte Ltd. of Tokyo. The Japanese company was
marketing M&amp;M lookalikes in their country, which also is M&amp;M
territory.
   U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., asked the Japanese
ambassador to the United States to investigate. Lotte agreed in
July 1987 to halt production of the copycats, which were advertised
as ``Mellow in your mouth, won't stick to your hand.''

<HEAD>New Face in the Credit-Card Game</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the telephone company comes calling, will
American credit-card users change their charging ways?
   That's the question of the moment in the world of personal
finance, thanks to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
introduction of a combination telephone and credit card known as
the AT&amp;T Universal Card.
   The giant-sized venture seems to be off to a promising start.
While the company won't give specifics, it has described consumers'
early response to the card as ``far above initial expectations.''
   By some outsiders' estimates, AT&amp;T could sign up as many as 5
million Universal cardholders by the end of the year.
   But close observers of the financial-services business say the
venture's ultimate success is by no means assured.
   They say it is a lot to expect that large numbers of people who
get Universal cards will cut up and throw away the ones they
already carry from banks and issuers like American Express and
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
   Whatever happens, analysts add, consumers evidently will
continue to be faced with an old problem: Paying much higher
interest rates for credit-card borrowing than they do for just
about any other type of loan.
   ``This will not shake up the credit card industry,'' says Robert
Heady, a North Palm Beach, Fla., publisher of several newsletters
on banking subjects.
   What lured AT&amp;T into such a high-stakes gamble is plain to see:
the business, fed by Americans' seemingly insatiable passion for
plastic, is big and getting bigger all the time.
   In spite of deterrents like tax-law changes that are eliminating
deductions for consumer interest, more than 20 percent of all
retail sales in this country excluding automobiles now are paid for
by credit card, up from 11.6 percent in 1983.
   AT&amp;T is offering several lures to try to establish a strong
beachhead in this market. For one thing, it says customers can
avoid ever having to pay an annual fee if they apply in 1990 and
keep using their cards at least once a year.
   For another, the company is offering 10 percent discounts from
its prevailing charge-card rates when the card is used for
long-distance calls.
   Card-users who carry a balance from one month to the next will
pay a variable annual interest rate that is starting off at 18.9
percent, AT&amp;T says.
   The rate doesn't differ drastically from industry norms in the
18 percent-20 percent range, at a time when rates on mortgages,
home equity loans and auto loans generally run in the 9.5
percent-12.5 percent range.
   So however much AT&amp;T is going to step up the competition, it
evidently has no plans for a price war.
   At the same time, analysts say, the chance to avoid annual fees
may be attractive to consumers who pay full balances each month
before interest charges kick in.
   But as Heady points out, AT&amp;T is hardly the first issuer to
offer a no-fee card. Some banks across the country have similar
deals, he observes, with lower interest rates to boot.
   In sum, most analysts believe, the addition of a major new
player doesn't seem likely to change the game very much.
   ``Credit cards are essentially perceived as a convenience,''
Heady says. ``Consumers have been paying atrociously high
credit-card interest rates for years.''

<HEAD>Sindlinger Says We're In a Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a time when some economic analysts are
erasing the word ``recession'' from their forecasts, Sindlinger &amp;
Co. is declaring that one is under way.
   It is widespread, says Albert Sindlinger. By his measurements,
it involves 41 of the 48 contiguous states, all but Washington and
the Midwestern states of Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana,
Illinois and Minnesota.
   It is an unusual recession, a credit crunch recession, says
Sindlinger. His staff gets into detailed telephone conversations
with close to 1,000 Americans each week, different ones each week,
as it has for 30 years.
   The Midwest was hit hardest by the last recession, so families
there were less likely to get overextended financially after it
ended.
   The list of respondents is scientifically selected, and the
questions are devised to elicit specific, hard details about each
household that are computerized at the company's headquarters in
Wallingford, Pa.
   From analyses of the information garnered, Sindlinger is able to
get a reading on the finances of the nation's 99.2 million
households, the biggest sector in the entire economy. Households
call the shots, he says.
   As of a few days ago, the financial condition of households
wasn't good. They were loaded with debt, they were having a tough
time paying their bills, and they were very concerned.
   The U.S. government, whose statistical findings are used in
determining official recessions, disagrees with Sindlinger. To the
government, at least two straight quarters of declining gross
national product constitute recession.
   That definition has come under plenty of criticism, especially
since the facts often aren't known until weeks after the event.
Some critics even declare the idea outdated, but the definition
remains the most widely used.
   Officially, there have not been two successive quarterly
declines in gross national product since the early 1980s. That is,
based on government figures.
   Based on Sindlinger's definition, there have been. He arrives at
his conclusions based on answers to these questions:
   1. Is your current income higher, lower or the same as it was
six months ago?
   2. Is your expected income six months hence higher, lower or the
same?
   3. A similar question about job security.
   4. A similar one about local business.
   Summed up, the answers represent household liquidity, and when
negative answers outweigh positive responses Sindlinger declares an
area in recession.
   Among other findings in the latest survey, his researchers
detected that expenses were rising faster than incomes. In that
situation, and with debts to repay, consumers can't buy goods.
   Earlier, government figures showed the economy flirting with
recession, but that threat was revised away.
   In January, for example, the government reported gross national
product rose by only 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1989.
That weakness led to expectations of further weakness in the first
quarter of 1990.
   You might recall that at that time, in January, there arose a
flurry of recession talk, as many economists warned of eventual
negative growth. But in January the government revised that weak
0.5 percent to 0.9 percent.
   That revision caused some economic forecasters to change their
outlook. Instead of recession, they spoke again of a soft landing.
   In March, when the government re-revised that fourth-quarter
estimate to an even more positive 1.1 percent, it all but wiped out
the recession forecasts.
   Meanwhile, says Sindlinger, financial matters were growing worse
in the households of the United States.
   Obviously, Sindlinger says, when the consumer is caught in a
vise it lessens both his desire and ability to buy at retail. If
retailers can't sell, Sindlinger asks, what can manufacturers
expect?

   The Earth is in style.
   Alarmed by the planet's dwindling resources, or propelled by the
belief that ecology helps sell clothes, fashion designers and
retailers have latched onto environmental issues with a gusto that
recalls the stampede to short skirts.
   Tags on sportswear declare ``Don't Bungle the Jungle.'' Whales,
black panthers, tigers and giant pandas adorn T-shirts. Popular
fabric colors include earth tones and the bright hues of the rain
forest. Catalogs are printed on recycled paper. Glossy ads for
fashion designers invite consumers to donate money to environmental
groups.
   ``So many companies are getting on the environmental bandwagon,
because many polls indicate that the environment is the predominant
social issue of the '90s,'' said Leslie Gottlieb of the Council on
Economic Priorities.
   Women's Wear Daily has been swamped with news releases
announcing the introduction of new lines of clothing with an
eco-conscience, said Maryellen Gordon, a WWD sportswear news editor.
   ``The industry does have a history of being involved in
humanitarian causes,'' she said. ``But I don't believe every one of
these companies is concerned with the environment. ... By printing
`Save the Whale' on a T-shirt, they think they can bring in a lot
of money.''
   ``I'm sure part of it is corporations wanting to position
themselves in a positive way with the public,'' said Ron Geatz, a
spokesman for the Nature Conservancy, a private foundation that
buys parcels of threatened land to protect the habitats of rare and
endangered plants and animals.
   Geatz added that the corporate heads leading the way seem to be
those most personally involved.
   Charles Dayan, president of Bonjour clothing, became a corporate
activist for the environment several summers ago when syringes and
other debris washed up on the beach at his New Jersey vacation home.
   ``We couldn't go to the water. We couldn't let the kids play
there,'' he said. ``That's when we realized it was getting too
close to us and something had to be done.''
   Now each item of Bonjour merchandise _ jeans and shirts,
sunglasses and socks _ bears a tag with tips on how to save water
and reduce pollutants. The cost to Bonjour, Dayan said, is ``in the
millions.''
   ``I really don't know if it will sell one extra jean or watch,''
Dayan said. ``I doubt it.''
   Other companies like Ninety, Esprit, Ellen Tracy and the United
Stars of America division of J.G. Hook are donating profits to
environmental causes.
   Patagonia, an outdoor outfitter based in Ventura, Calif., has
donated 10 percent of its annual pretax profits to environmental
groups since 1984. This year, the total will reach about $1 million.
   Patagonia's catalogs feature essays on the environment. The
company has reduced waste output at its headquarters by 62 percent
by cutting back on paper products and recycling whatever it can.
   Some customers choose Patagonia products ``because of where the
profits go,'' said Kevin Sweeney, a company spokesman. ``Last year,
we gave away twice as much as we spent in advertising.''
   But the line often blurs between promoting environmental causes
and promoting a product. The Nature Conservancy struck deals with
two fashion companies, Ellen Tracy and Esprit, after being
approached with ``a couple dozen'' offers, Geatz said.
   Ellen Tracy's ads show a model in a sunny orange jacket over
olive pants, standing on a pristine beach. The tagline reads, ``The
clothing ... perfect for spring. The background ... perfect
forever.''
   The conservancy's phone number is displayed in small print.
   ``We've always shot our (spring) ads on the beach. ... We added
the tagline to tie into the Nature Conservancy thing _ kind of cute
to bring it all together,'' said Claire Fay, a spokeswoman for
Ellen Tracy.
   She said the company's owner, Herbert Gallen, made ``a
substantial donation'' to the Nature Conservancy and paid a $15
membership fee for each of Ellen Tracy's 200 employees.
   Esprit contributes $1 each time it sells a $25 tote bag
imprinted with images of bighorn sheep and Little Kern golden
trout. The company's spring catalog, printed on recycled paper,
opens with a discourse on the environment. The background is a
photograph of a swimsuit-clad model playing in a spray of water.
   ``Pollution is by and large the result of an economic system
gone out of control,'' the ad says. ``Consumers should evaluate
carefully what they need, and buy accordingly.''
   The ad implores people ``to temper their appetites.'' Esprit, it
notes, has already begun to do so _ at its San Francisco
headquarters, it has reduced the use of paper in the business
department and the cafeteria. The company plans to hire an
eco-manager to head environmental programs.
   ``Before telling our customers what to do, we need to do our own
homework,'' said Esprit spokeswoman Celeste Alleyne.
   But critics scoff at the notion of the fashion industry being a
friend of the environment.
   ``The irony is that we're talking about a business based on
premeditated waste,'' said Stuart Ewen, the chairman of the
Communications Department at Hunter College in New York City. ``If
you were to do a study of the history of product obsolescence, the
model would be fashion.''
   At factory level, other ecological concerns surface.
   ``The next step we have to take is to move to our suppliers, to
make sure (the clothes) are made in an environmentally safe way,''
said Sweeney, the Patagonia spokesman.
   Esprit and Ellen Tracy are studying how to make production of
their clothes eco-friendly. Bonjour president Dayan said he wrote
to manufacturers all over the world instructing them to use
biodegradable plastic bags and soaps, as well as recycled cardboard.
   However, he acknowledged, ``We can't force them to do it.''

   The Rev. George Stallings, the black
Roman Catholic priest suspended for starting the independent
African American Catholic Church in Washington, says ``We are no
longer Roman Catholic, but we are Catholic.''
   He told an audience at Princeton Theological Seminary that
catholic means ``universal'' and that his new church is a
sacramental church and derives its priesthood from the apostles.
   However, he said it has dropped what he called ``accidentals''
of Roman Catholicism, including allegiance to the pope and bans on
birth control and a celibacy requirement for priests.
   Stallings said his new church's discipline permits an option
about celibacy for priests and allows contraception. However, he
said it considers itself a sister church to Rome.

<HEAD>Ancient Jewish Deliverance Takes on Immediacy in Changed World</HEAD>

   This time, the dream was reality for the world's
Jews. To a large extent, an aspiration and hope of the Passover
season had been fulfilled in a contemporary context.
   A modern ``Pharaoh'' had let a confined Jewish people go.
   ``At last, most are allowed to go free,'' says a special
haggadah, or narrative of the ancient deliverance of the enslaved
Jews from Egypt. Memorializing that exodus this year had a ring of
present happening.
   ``We have good cause to be joyous, for hundreds of thousands of
people the world over, Jews and others, have gained freedom within
the past year,'' said Sholom D. Comay, president of the American
Jewish Committee.
   Referring to the ``epoch-making changes'' toward freedom that
have surged through the Soviet Union and other nations of Eastern
Europe, he said the task of building working democracies still
remains.
   ``It behooves us to work unceasingly to move forward the growth
of human rights and democratic principles in all of newly open
Eastern Europe,'' he said in a Passover message.
   The week-long observance continues through this weekend,
coinciding with the Christian celebration of Easter. Both emphasize
freedom from bondage, Easter from sin and death, Passover from
oppression and tyranny.
   The perennial Passover theme _ the unending responsibility of
every generation to resist religious repression _ took on a note of
jubilation this time at the lifting of restraints on Soviet Jews.
   More than 71,000 of them immigrated last year to Israel, the
U.S. and elsewhere, far more than in any previous year, and l00,000
were expected to do so this year.
   At the same time, fuller liberties of religious practice and
study developed in the Soviet sphere.
   ``It's not only a miracle, it's a double miracle,'' Simcha
Dinitz, chairman of the World Zionist Organization, told a New York
conference, noting that Soviet Jews not only were being allowed to
leave, but to practice their faith in the Soviet.
   The special Passover narrative, ``The Exodus Haggadah, From
Tyranny to Freedom, A Celebration,'' was prepared by the United
Jewish Appeal Rabbinic Cabinet, in cooperation with the National
Conference on Soviet Jewry.
   ``Ours is the special merit to see again God's redemptive power
evident,'' said Rabbi Matthew Simon, chairman of the appeal's
rabbinic cabinet.
   The haggadah says ``suppression of faith'' weighed on Soviet
Jews for 70 years. ``Many suffered harassment; some endured prison.
The forces of oppression tried to afflict them with amnesia of the
spirit. But, they remembered.''
   Now, at last, doors have swung wide, a passage continues. ``We
know not how long the door of freedom will remain open. We walk
with them in their exodus...we commit ourselves to accompany them
on their road to freedom...
   ``We sing with grateful joy and pride, bring our people home.''
   Rabbi David A. Wortman, executive director of the Jewish
Community Relations Council of Philadelphia and editor of the
haggadah said it marks the ``miraculous extension of the ancient
process initiated by God and Moses.''
   He noted that 600,000 Jews were involved in the ancient exodus
from Egypt, and said estimates are that those leaving the Soviet
Union by 1993 ``will have surpassed in number those who left
Egypt.''
   Soviet Jews total about 2 million.
   Some of those released earlier from the pre-reform Soviet to
Israel are quoted. ``It is like being reborn,'' said Vladimir
Slepak of his first Israeli morning.
   Ida Nudel said on her arrival there: ``A few hours ago I was
almost a slave in Moscow. Now I'm a free woman in my own country.
It is the moment of my life.''

<HEAD>South Americans Turn to Moderates To Consolidate Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD LEWAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Americans facing high
foreign debts, ruinous inflation and stagnant economies are
rejecting radicalism for moderate leaders they hope can solve the
problems and consolidate democratic rule.
   When Fernando Collor de Mello and Patricio Aylwin became the
presidents of Brazil and Chile in March, it was the first time all
12 South American republics were governed by popularly elected
civilians.
   In the past, South Americans have swung from strident
pro-leftists to right-wing military dictators. Now, they are
abandoning the radical rhetoric and promises of radicals and
turning to leaders who favor painful steps toward economic order.
   ``History reveals that stable and effective democracies are
those that present centrist options to the electorate,'' wrote
Manuel d'Ornellas, editor and columnist of Expreso, a conservative
daily in Lima, Peru.
   There is concern that, if free-market economics and democratic
freedoms do not produce rapid improvements, the result may be a
political tug of war between left and right.
   ``South Americans have tried the dictators and the old-style
conservatives,'' said David Fleischer, a Brazilian political
scientist. ``If this third group of free-market liberals goes down
the drain, people will vote for the radical left in five years,
which may well prompt a backlash from the military.''
   Fear of such an outcome already has translated into amnesty for
past violations.
   Uruguay and Argentina have pardoned military officers charged
with human rights abuses. Brazil gave amnesty to leftist opponents
of a 1964-1985 military regime, but did not consider prosecuting
military chiefs accused of torture.
   Leftist rebels have been released from jail and secret police
agencies abolished.
   Polls in Argentina indicate President Carlos Menem remains by
far the most popular political figure despite severe austerity
measures, strikes and dissent within his own party.
   Luis Lacalle, the new president of Uruguay, implemented
austerity demanded by the International Monetary Fund, worked out
an agreement with the second-largest party and survived two general
strikes by the biggest labor federation.
   In Brazil, surveys indicate Collor's harsh economic plan is
supported by 80 percent of the people. Studies done in Peru say the
people are ready for a free-market economic shock to end rampant
inflation.
   Free-market policies are gaining ground across the continent.
   Government coddling of domestic businesses, promoted by military
rulers concerned with national security, is giving way as Argentina
and Brazil strive to create a South American common market.
   Economic liberalism also has been fostered by concern that the
foreign aid funds of the United States and other countries are
being diverted increasingly to Eastern Europe.
   Latin American and Carribbean countries will receive $350
million in U.S. aid this year, down from $545 million in 1989.
   Record inflation has given South American leaders the political
leverage to take bold economic measures. Here is a brief
country-by-country review:
   _ Brazil: Although Collor narrowly defeated socialist Luis
Inacio da Silva in December's runoff, he has mustered public and
congressional support for a severe plan that includes an 18-month
freeze on 80 percent of bank and investment savings, sharp tax and
utility increases, and cuts in subsidies and tax incentives.
   _ Argentina: Menem shocked his labor-backed Peronist party by
raising utility and other rates by several hundred percent;
removing wage, price and foreign exchange controls; forcibly
converting bank deposits into government bonds; slashing the
budget, and moving to sell money-losing state companies.
   _ Bolivia: Former President Victor Paz Estenssoro brought 24,000
percent annual inflation down to 16 percent in 1989 by freeing
prices and the exchange rate, closing money-losing government tin
mines and reducing a bloated bureacracy. Jaime Paz Zamora, a
socialist who succeeded him, has announced plans to attract foreign
capital and sell state industries.
   _ Chile: Aylwin says he will not discard the free-market
structure set up by his predecessor, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who
kept inflation down to 20 percent a year and built a strong economy.
   _ Peru: Five years of economic chaos under leftist President
Alan Garcia bankrupted the country and pushed inflation to 2,775
percent in 1989. Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, head of a
conservative coalition, and centrist Alberto Fujimori are in a
runoff election to succeed Garcia.
   _ Venezuela: President Carlos Andres Perez, outwardly leftist
when in office a decade ago, recently announced IMF-like economic
reforms designed to restructure the foreign debt and steer the
country on a free-market path.
   _ Guyana and Suriname: Mounting foreign debt, sharp declines in
economic output and rising unemployment are forcing socialist
leaders to alter their policies. Prime Minister Hamilton Green of
Guyana has said ``private enterprise doesn't conflict with
socialism.'' His party seeks foreign capital and imposed unpopular
fiscal measures demanded by the IMF.
   _ Ecuador: President Rodrigo Borja, a center-leftist, favors
government fixing of exchange and interest rates, but has welcomed
foreign investment, kept the state out of major industries, and
declared himself an opponent of ``inefficient'' state-run
enterprises.
   How long South America's poor will accept austerity remains a
question.
   Riots last year cost 300 lives in Venezuela, where subsidies
have been a part of life for 30 years. Recent protests of increased
utility and gasoline prices on college campuses led to a violent
crackdown.
   Observers in Brazil say Collor will have about six months to
stop inflation now running at 4,850 percent annually. Similar
rumblings are being felt in Colombia and Guyana.
   ``If solutions don't come from within the system, people might
look for solutions outside the system,'' said Federico Storani, a
leading Argentine congressman who represents the opposition Radical
Civic Union.
   Many experts feel moderate leaders will weather the storm
because of a growing public perception that free-market policies
are the only cure for chronic stagnation and inflation.
   Menem told reporters recently: ``The changes in Eastern Europe
are telling us something: Ideologies in the world have ended. The
world wants to live in freedom, wants to be master of its own
destiny.''

   As dinosaurs go, they were the biggest of the
big. They lived in a region that is now the Rocky Mountains, no
dwarfs themselves when it comes to hills. And it's in those
mountains that their bones are interred, offering today's
scientists valuable clues to the history of life.

<TEXT>
   For more than a century, scientists have been
digging into a vast dinosaur graveyard in the Rocky Mountains,
unraveling the mysteries of the largest creatures ever to roam the
planet.
   Here lie the fossilized bones of dinosaurs that lived 140
million years ago when the Front Range was a great semi-arid
lowland with periods of rain and drought. Colorado was a flat
landscape with large meandering streams, vegetation and open spaces.
   Man was still 138 million years away.
   Called the Morrison Formation for a small town southwest of
Denver where the first dinosaur skeleton was found here in 1877,
the graveyard lies on either side of the Rocky Mountains from Idaho
south to New Mexico.
   Paleontologists call it ``the capital of dinosaur research.''
   In January, a Colorado expedition found a jaw and vertebrae
fragments west of Fort Collins that belonged to the rare,
meat-gulping hunter epanterias.
   Robert Bakker, a University of Colorado paleontologist who led
that team, says people weren't interested in dinosaurs before the
1877 discovery because they didn't know much about them. He said
that before the Colorado find there were ``miserable fragments'' of
fossils from Europe.
   ``The Morrison finds really put American science on the map and
continues to surprise us every field season,'' says Bakker, who has
been working on the formation since 1974.
   A group of preservation-minded people in Colorado has organized
``Friends of Dinosaur Ridge'' and is working with local and state
officials on a project to protect a famous Morrison Formation
outcropping southwest of Denver.
   The group has proposed a park a mile long and 200 feet wide. It
would lie on the first ridge _ a ``hogback'' _ west of Lakewood,
Colo., a Denver suburb. If the proposal is approved, Colorado 26
would be closed from Rooney Road to Colorado 93.
   Joe Tempel, environmental manager for the state highway
department, described the proposed Dinosaur Ridge Park as an
outdoor education laboratory, a ``hands-on science, ecology,
natural history park.''
   The most extensive collection of Morrison dinosaur fossils are
housed in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh.
   ``The Morrison gives us the best picture of the really big
dinosaurs that lived in the age of dinosaurs,'' says David Burman,
curator of vertebrae fossils at the Carnegie. ``Because of the
nature of the environment it represented it has preserved more and
better specimens of any formation in any period.''
   Scientists credit the Rocky Mountains with allowing them to
study the dinosaur fossils. As the earth's crust rose and
contorted, erosion exposed layers of sandstone, limestone and
shale. The layers display the fossilized bones, footprints and
environment of the Jurassic Period.
   The Jurassic, a time from 205 million years to 130 million years
ago, is considered the second geological period in the age of
dinosaurs. The Morrison Formation appeared in the Upper Jurassic
period, 140 million years ago, when the dinosaurs were the largest
they ever got.
   The Morrison Formation is ``part of one of the most complete
records of the history of life you can find,'' says Dr. Richard
Stucky, paleontologist at the Denver Museum of Natural History.
``There are episodes missing in the Rocky Mountains, but we do have
a fairly complete record.''
   In 1877, the dinosaur graveyard was discovered by visiting
scientists who found an apatosaurus and a stegosaurus near
Morrison. That find was quickly followed by the discovery of an
allosaurus and a camarasaurus north of Canon City, and dozens of
dinosaurs north of Laramie, Wyo. Those discoveries kicked off a
kind of ``fossil gold rush'' that continues today.
   There are dozens of theories about the mysterious mass
extinction of dinosaurs at the end of the Mesozoic Era. Among them
are movements of the Earth, starvation, parasites, poisons, changes
in the climate, meteorites and even extraterrestrial hunters.
   Bakker believes dinosaurs became extinct because of worldwide
diseases that turned into an ``epidemiological nightmare.''
   ``Dinosaurs didn't go out with a bang, they went out with
worldwide diarrhea,'' he says.
   Big animals travel and are very vulnerable to disease, Bakker
says. As land bridges formed throughout the globe, the animals
would move, spreading all the hundreds of diseases throughout all
the herds on all continents _ eventually killing the lot.
   Most of the Carnegie collection of fossils came from what is now
Dinosaur National Monument, on the northwestern Colorado-Utah
border in Moffat County, Colo. Scientists took 750,000 pounds of
crated dinosaurs from the quarries.
   The expedition brought ``the best apatosaurus, a top-notch
diplodocus, a teen-age camarasaurus and the most complete
sauropod,'' Burman says.
   The first dinosaur at the museum was the diplodocus, found at
Sheep Creek, Wyo., which Burman says is one of the most famous in
the world. Plaster casts have been made and shipped to Germany,
France, Argentina, Spain and Portugal.
   ``One of the first plaster casts was shipped to the British
Museum at a time when these big fossils were relatively new, so
they created quite a stir in Europe,'' Burman says. ``Newspapers
carried headlines that read `Dippy Comes to England.'''
   The original diplodocus is still in the Carnegie Museum. But
Pittsburgh is not the only place to see such giants.
   ``In terms of seeing big dinosaurs before your eyes, you won't
see anything like the Morrison Formation in the world,'' Burman
says. ``It gives people a look at how the dinosaurs occur in the
rock.''

<HEAD>USDA Adds New Cost Figures to Farm Bill Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers and lobbyists have a new fistful of
statistics from the Agriculture Department as they continue
jousting over the 1990 farm bill.
   An annual report by the department's Economic Research Service
shows how much it cost to produce major field crops in 1988, a year
when drought reduced yields and sent market prices soaring. Net
returns are also listed.
   The report, Costs of Production _ Major Field Crops, 1988, is
part of an annual series by the USDA called Economic Indicators of
the Farm Sector.
   Analysts make clear how the statistics are compiled and
presented. But there are always ways to use figures in support of
various arguments, and the 1988 cost figures are no exception.
   To illustrate, assume that it cost a farmer $100 to plant one
acre of gadgetbeans, including field preparation, seed, chemicals
and all the rest. The expense of producing one acre of gadgetbeans
would be $100.
   That would be true regardless of the gadgetbean yield. The cost
per acre is the key and has nothing directly to do with how many
bushels are produced.
   But turn that around and assume again that it cost $100 per
planted acre to grow gadgetbeans and that the yield normally would
be 100 bushels per acre. On the average, the usual cost of
production would be $1 per bushel.
   However, if one year the yield dropped to 50 bushels per acre,
the cost of production would be $2 per bushel. If it dropped to 10
bushels, the cost would be $10 per bushel, and so on.
   This involves the ``unit cost'' of production, the cost per
bushel or pound or whatever measure is used. It is not the same as
costs based on each planted acre.
   And the distinction is important.
   It might serve a group to let Congress know about the high
per-bushel costs of producing gadgetbeans while ignoring the
per-acre costs _ and returns _ in hopes lawmakers might be
persuaded to boost subsidies.
   The USDA report includes both methods of figuring.
   ``Costs of producing most major field crops increased in 1988,''
the report said. ``Variable cash expenses per planted acre were
higher for all crops except cotton, flaxseed and sunflowers.''
   Variable cash expanses include seed, fertilizer, fuel, chemicals
and hired labor. So-called fixed cash expenses include taxes,
insurance, interest on operating and real estate loans, and
portions of the general farm overhead.
   The report said that in 1988 variable cash expenses rose about 5
percent per acre for corn, barley, oats, wheat and soybeans. Rice
expenses climbed 4 percent; grain sorghum 2 percent; and peanuts 1
percent.
   ``Despite increased costs and lower yields, due primarily to
drought, production returns for most crops improved'' in 1988, the
report said. ``Higher prices offset lower yields for soybeans,
sunflowers and all major grains except barley.''
   Corn yields per acre dropped by 30 percent in 1988, but harvest
prices rose to $2.60 per bushel from $1.57 in 1987, the report
said. Other grain prices also increased.
   ``Net cash returns to corn production were $54 per (planted)
acre compared with $28 in 1987,'' the report said. Direct federal
payments to farmers were not included.
   The net cash returns to oats producers were reported at $43 per
planted acre, nationally, compared with $18 in 1987. Soybean cash
returns climbed to $100 per acre from $77 the year before, and cash
returns to wheat farmers jumped to $28 per acre from $18. Net cash
returns for sorghum rose to $89 from $14 in 1987.
   ``Returns to barley, flaxseed and cotton production fell
slightly,'' the report said. ``Barley yield dropped by more than 40
percent, flaxseed yield by more than 60 percent. The gross value of
production per acre of cotton declined 28 percent as both the price
of cotton and its yield fell.''
   Shifting gears, the analysis said that the lower yields ``led to
dramatically higher costs per unit of output'' in drought-ridden
1988.
   When all economic costs are considered _ cash expenses, capital
replacement and land _ it cost $3.16 per bushel to produce corn in
1988, on a national average, compared with $2.06 in 1987 and $2.05
in 1986.
   Total economic costs of producing wheat jumped to $4.59 per
bushel in 1988 from $3.61 in 1987 and $3.90 in 1986.
   Other crops and their total economic costs of production as
shown for 1988, compared with 1987 and 1986, included:
   _Barley, $4.92 per bushel, $2.79 and $2.89.
   _Cotton, 76.3 cents per pound, 67.1 cents and 83.8 cents.
   _Flaxseed, $14.24 per bushel, $5.75 and $5.69.
   _Oats, $3.59 per bushel, $2.39 and $2.12.
   _Peanuts, 26.4 cents per pound, 26.8 cents and 25.4 cents.
   _Rice, $8.70 per 100 pounds, $7.94 and $7.40.
   _Grain sorghum, $2.50 per bushel, $1.99 and $2.
   _Soybeans, $6.94 per bushel, $5.03 and $4.89.
   _Sunflowers, $13.93 per 100 pounds of seed, $8.02 and $8.63.

<HEAD>Creditors Request Trustee; Judge Rules in Favor of Eastern Pilots</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The unsecured creditors of Eastern Airlines have
asked a bankruptcy court to appoint a special trustee to take over
the ailing carrier and seek a buyer for it.
   Tuesday's request by the committee of unsecured credits came one
day after preferred shareholders challenged Eastern's
reorganization proposal and submitted a plan that would put the
airline in the hands of the shareholders, unsecured creditors and
new managers.
   The two groups are Eastern's biggest creditors, owed a total of
more than $1.6 billion. After long supporting management, the
creditors have become exasperated by Eastern's growing losses and
its recent plans to cut debt payments.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, Eastern's pilots union won a key victory when
a federal judge reversed earlier decisions by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton R. Lifland.
   U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet ruled that the union can
seek arbitration over its contention that Eastern has been merged
with its sister carrier Continental Airlines.
   Sweet also decided that the pilots union may proceed with a
lawsuit against Eastern over its practice of leasing aircraft and
crews from Continental.
   Lifland had previously ruled in both cases that the bankruptcy
court was the only proper forum for deciding those issues.
   In his 71-page opinion, Sweet wrote that the important question
was ``when and in what forum collectively bargained-for rights may
be enforced against an employer who has sought protection from
creditors in bankruptcy.''
   If a court concludes that Eastern and Continental have
effectively been merged, it would trigger certain protective labor
provisions, such as seniority rights, contained in the pilots
union's contract with Eastern.
   Eastern's pilots, Machinists and flight attendants struck the
Miami-based airline on March 4, 1989, forcing it into Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection five days later.
   The Machinists union remains on strike against Eastern.
   Lifland had denied the pilots' request to lift an automatic stay
protecting Eastern against arbitration on the union's contention
that the transfer of Eastern assets to Texas Air and Continental
constituted a merger between Eastern and its sister carrier.
   Lifland ruled last September that arbitration would usurp the
bankruptcy court's role in Eastern's reorganization and ``thwart
the goal of judicial speed and economy'' necessary for
rehabilitating the airline.
   In Sweet's second ruling, the pilots union was allowed to
proceed with its suit in U.S. District Court in Miami aimed at
blocking Eastern's practice of leasing jets with crews _ known as
``wet-leasing'' _ from Continental. The union had claimed the
leases violated its contract with Eastern because Continental
pilots have been used rather than Eastern fliers.
   Last fall, Lifland issued an injunction against the union's
suit, maintaining it was an attempt to interfere with the
bankruptcy court's jurisdiction.
   A bankruptcy court hearing on the trustee issue was scheduled
for Friday morning. At the same time, Lifland was slated to
consider Eastern's request for $80 million to be withdrawn from
escrow funds for operating expenses in the second quarter and some
payments to creditors.
   Eastern's unions have been attempting for some time to have a
trustee appointed to replace Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's
parent Texas Air Corp. The unions accuse Lorenzo of funneling
assets from Eastern to Continental and to Texas Air.
   The committee of unsecured creditors, who are owed $980 million,
agreed last week to reject the airline's latest reorganization
proposal and seek the appointment of a trustee.
   In formally filing its motion for a trustee Tuesday, the
committee said ``Eastern's devastating, constantly expanding and
unending losses are extremely damaging to unsecured creditors.''
   The motion said Eastern and Texas Air have been unable to
project the results of Eastern's operations, ``to the extent that
the committee has lost confidence in their stewardship of the
business.''
   Bruce Simon, an attorney for the Air Line Pilots Association,
said he believes there is a ``very real'' possibility that Lifland
could decide at Friday's hearing to name a trustee.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak in Miami reiterated the
airline's position that there is no ``legal or policy basis'' for
the appointment of a trustee. She called the creditors' motion a
``ruse'' that is being used as a negotiating tool.
   Ms. Ceremsak said Sweet's rulings were ``procedural,'' rather
than on the merits of the case.
   Art Kent, a Texas Air spokesman in Houston, said the creditors'
motion ``totally ignores the historical, continuing and proposed
support by Texas Air and Continental of Eastern's recovery.''

   A federal judge is trying to determine why
government regulators and Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating
Jr. put widely varied valuations on holdings in Keating's collapsed
real estate and savings and loan empire.
   Keating, testifying Tuesday in his suit to reclaim his $5.5
billion Lincoln Savings and Loan Association seized by regulators a
year ago, estimated that the thrift was worth $500 million to $700
million at the time.
   Regulators who seized the Irvine, Calif., thrift and its real
estate holdings in Arizona, Texas and Louisiana, contend that
taxpayers eventually will have to absorb up to $2 billion in losses
of federally insured deposits that Keating used to finance his
empire.
   ``The government says it's $2 billion in the red and the former
operator says it's $600 million in the black,'' U.S. District Judge
Stanley Sporkin said Tuesday. ``I'm in a quandary. Let's get the
receiver in here.''
   Representatives of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the
receiver that took over Lincoln and downgraded its value, are to
testify next week.
   In a civil suit accusing Keating and a dozen associates of fraud
and racketeering, regulators allege that Lincoln inflated the value
of its real estate holdings and loans far beyond a price they would
command on the open market.
   However, Keating, in his fourth day on the witness stand, put
the blame for the entire S&amp;L crisis on thrift regulators
undervaluing S&amp;L holdings and loans. He said it ``caused a panic in
the real estate market'' that brought about a self-fulfilling
prophecy.
   ``There's no question that the economy of Phoenix has been
wrecked in the cause of thrift regulation,'' Keating testified.
``Today's market is not a happy situation because the government
now owns $20 billion of Arizona real estate that it's dumping on
the market.''
   As an example, he pointed to the luxurious Phoenician Resort
that, using Lincoln funds, he built outside Phoenix at a cost of
$275 million. Lincoln later sold a 45 percent interest in the
Phoenician and another hotel in Phoenix to interests in Kuwait for
$170 million.
   Keating estimated that Lincoln's 55 percent interest in hotel is
now worth $190 million, almost double the $99 million asset value
listed by government regulators on their books _ if the development
potential of adjacent land is considered.
   ``It's a complete misunderstanding of value to write that hotel
down,'' he said. ``You can't just take a piece of dirt in the
desert and sell it as a piece of dirt. You have to look at what it
was put there for, its highest and best use.''
   James Murphy, representing the Treasury Department's Office of
Thrift Supervision in the suit, said Keating's testimony on the
valuation of the property was vague.
   ``We can't look at what an asset is worth in 10 years,'' he
said. ``We have to look at what we could get for it today. If the
assets aren't greater than the liabilities, an S&amp;L's insolvent.
That's the definition of insolvency.''
   Keating is expected to spend at least another two days on the
witness stand in the evidentiary hearing, which began in January
and has now consumed more than 20 full days of courtroom time.
   Murphy said he plans to call four rebuttal witness next week,
including the FDIC representatives that Sporkin wants to testify.
   The judge said Tuesday he wanted to hear closing arguments in
the case in June.

   A deep-sea search will be conducted for the
cargo door that blew off a United Airlines jet even though
investigators determined why nine people were sucked out of the
airliner over the Pacific Ocean, officials say.
   The National Transportation Safety Board voted 3-0 Tuesday to
blame United, the Boeing Co. and the Federal Aviation
Administration for failure to correct problems with the door of the
jumbo jet before the Feb. 24, 1989, incident aboard Flight 811.
   An aviation lawyer, meanwhile, said the board's conclusions
should spur the FAA into acting more quickly to correct dangerous
deficiencies in airliners.
   NTSB investigators said inspection of the door that popped off
at 22,000 feet, carrying a section of fuselage and nine people with
it, still could provide evidence for improving aircraft safety.
   A sophisticated Navy probe unit will be lowered into the ocean
in June, said board accident investigator Ron Schleed. If it can
spot the door, another device will be dispatched to recover it, he
said.
   ``If they don't find it within 12 to 15 days, that'll be the end
of it,'' Schleed said.
   The board concluded that even without the door it had enough
evidence to determine the probable cause of the incident: ``the
sudden opening of the improperly latched forward lower lobe cargo
door in flight and the subsequent explosive decompression.''
   Flight 811 returned to Honolulu after the harrowing incident on
a scheduled flight to New Zealand. Five other passengers were
seriously hurt and 33 received minor injuries when the plane
decompressed. The flight carried a crew of 18 and 337 passengers.
   The NTSB cited United for failing to maintain and inspect the
door properly. It said Boeing and the FAA failed to take timely
corrective action after a door on a Pan American Boeing 747 popped
partially open over the Atlantic in 1987.
   Contributing to the cause of the Flight 811 accident was ``a
deficiency in the design of the cargo door locking mechanisms,
which made them susceptible to in-service damage, and which allowed
the door to be unlatched, yet to show a properly latched and locked
position,'' the board said.
   The latch indicator systems would be changed with an imminent
FAA order that would require detectors on the locks, investigators
said.
   The NTSB issued a list of recommendations to ensure that cargo
doors are properly latched and that passengers can be safety
evacuated from an aircraft. It also recommended that emergency
vehicles at the Honolulu airport be painted in highly visible
colors rather than military camouflage patterns that cannot be seen
at night.
   NTSB conclusions and recommendations carry no judicial weight,
and its determination of a probable cause may not be introduced as
evidence in court cases.
   Lawyer Arthur Wolk of Philadelphia, who has brought several
cases against airlines and manufacturers for safety deficiencies,
praised the NTSB findings as the first time the board has ``come up
with the right conclusion and the right cause of an accident.''
   ``It shows they have the courage to assess blame properly,''
said Wolk. ``Hopefully, this will lead to greater FAA oversight of
the industry which is seeing stepped-up production.'' He and other
safety advocates have criticized the FAA for giving airlines too
long to correct cargo door deficiencies and other problems.
   ``If you don't act in an immediate fashion when you deal with
aviation, you're going to kill somebody,'' Wolk said.
   United spokesman Robert Dowdy said the airline properly
maintained and inspected the door of the plane used for Flight 811,
although he acknowledged that a required December 1988 inspection
was omitted because of a clerical error.
   Boeing had recommended that the board conclude that probable
cause of the incident could not be determined.
   In Seattle, Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble noted that changes have
been made in the doors and in inspection processes since the
accident.
   ``All of the necessary actions have been taken to ensure
integrity of that door's operation in flight,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Job security isn't a key issue only for the
United Auto Workers in this summer's contract talks, UAW President
Owen Bieber says. It's also critical to the Big Three automakers'
hopes of arresting their sliding fortunes, he says.
   ``Threatening workers with more insecurity and more cutbacks
will merely continue the downward spiral our companies are on,''
Bieber said Tuesday during the opening session of a three-day
bargaining conference of the union's Skilled Trades Department.
   The union meets in Kansas City next month to chart a course for
bargaining in July with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp.
   The Big Three have blamed sluggish car sales for the temporary
or permanent closing of assembly plants during the current
contract. Thousands of auto workers have been laid off because of
the companies' actions.
   The UAW wants that to end.
   ``They can and they must work with us for success, starting from
the firm foundation of a secure work force,'' Bieber said. ``This
search for a firm foundation will be at the heart of our collective
bargaining program and many other demands will flow from it.''
   Resolutions up for debate during the conference include job
security, training, health and safety, plant closings, wages and
education.
   ``America's industrial challenge is not a little bit
management's fault and a little bit the union's fault,'' Bieber
said. ``It's management's failures, plain and simple, that have put
us in the precarious situation we face in so many sectors today.''
   The 1-million member union has been shrinking as the automakers
trim their operations. Plants have closed because of slow sales,
some work performed by UAW members has been sent to Mexico or
overseas and automakers have laid off employees as they seek to
maintain profitability.
   The meeting that began Tuesday is one of several held by the UAW
across the country prior to the union's bargaining convention May
21-24 in Kansas City. At that meeting, delegates from all 1,200 UAW
locals gather to determine priorities in the national contract
talks.
   The union's Skilled Trades Department has jurisdiction over
workers such as tool and die makers, drafting employees and
designers who have more technically oriented jobs than other
factory workers. Skilled trades employees are paid more than
others, such as assemblers.
   The UAW opens negotiations in July with each of the Big Three
automakers. Later in the summer, the union will focus its efforts
on one company. The agreement with that company will serve as a
pattern for contracts with the other two.
   A potential contract issue that appears to be gaining steam
within the union is cost-of-living protection for retirees, which
doesn't exist in current auto contracts.
   The Big Three have an aging work force, one that is more
conscious of retirement programs than the much younger employees at
the largely non-union U.S. assembly plants operated by Japanese
companies.
   None of the 20 resolutions up for debate during this week's
skilled trades workers conference specifically mentions
cost-of-living adjustments in retirees' benefits.
   Bieber did not specifically mention the issue in his speech. But
at a news conference he said, ``The bottom line is that we have
taken care of our past retirees and will continue to do it now.''

<TEXT>
   A small U.S. computer company is launching a
daring plan to sell PCs in Japan, introducing a machine it claims
offers more features than the home-grown models that dominate the
Japanese market.
   AST Research Inc., a decade-old Irvine company, planned to
unveil its new machine today in Tokyo.
   The Dual SX-16 runs programs designed for IBM Corp. PCs and also
for machines made by NEC Corp., the Japanese computer giant that
dominates its home market much more than IBM does here. NEC has an
estimated 70 percent of the Japanese PC market.
   ``I think it's a bold move on the part of AST,'' said Sam
Albert, a 30-year IBM executive who now heads his own computer
consulting firm in Scarsdale, N.Y.
   PC makers such as AST have multiplied in recent years, and now
are struggling to set themselves apart from the rest. ``I've got to
believe there's at least 10'' makers such as AST, Albert said.
   ``It's clear that Compaq and IBM are on the dealers' shelves,
and there's only so much shelf space,'' he said. ``The market is
getting crowded in the United States and people are looking for
other shelves.''
   AST, which lost $7.5 million on sales of $457 million last year,
believes it can find those shelves in Japan, the world's
second-biggest market for PCs.
   The company turned profitable again in the last few quarters
after selling off its non-PC businesses, and spokesman Joel Don
said it is poised to move into Eastern Europe as well as Asia.
   A basic NEC computer, with no hard disk, no monitor and a
80386SX microprocessor from Intel Corp., costs about 390,000 yen,
or the equivalent of $2,475, Don said.
   A similar NEC ``clone'' computer made by Japan's Seiko Epson
Corp. costs 328,000 yen, or about $2,080, Don said.
   AST's computer will be priced somewhere in between, but
officials said they believed it would still sell well because of
its ability to run both the NEC and IBM programs.
   ``The Japanese cannot say that the product is missing
features,'' AST President Safi Qureshey said in a telephone
interview. ``It counters the arguments that American companies are
lazy, just comfortable with the U.S. market.''
   Don said the company probably will build the first machines at
its Fountain Valley plant in Southern California, then shift
production to Taiwan.
   AST teamed with Japan's Kawasaki Steel Corp. and Tomcat Computer
Corp. to develop the computer, which will be sold under the brand
names of Japanese distributors. AST is negotiating with several
potential distributors, including Sharp Corp., Don said.
   AST's machine will have a hard time making inroads into NEC's
dominion because the Japanese are so loyal to the company, said Tim
Bajarin of the Santa Clara-based Creative Strategies International
computer consulting firm.
   He noted that IBM and Apple already sell computers in Japan, and
suggested they might be the ones who lose Japanese market share to
AST.
   Qureshey and Albert said they believed it likelier that the
Epson machines would be the losers.
   ``My view is that the knockoff will take share away from the
other knockoff,'' Albert said.
   Qureshey said AST will be happy with just a small chunk of the
big Japanese market.
   ``NEC is so dominant that a small percentage of their share
means a lot to a small entrant,'' he said.

   The price of the transaction wasn't disclosed.
   ``The transaction involves about $665 million in assets which
were sold at a premium. Both parties have agreed not to reveal that
premium,'' said Thomas Lavelle, a bank spokesman.
   The deal is subject to regulatory approval but is expected to
close before the end of April, Lavelle said.
   New England Commercial Finance is an asset-based lending
operation with offices located outside of New England, the company
said in a statement released Tuesday.
   The sale is part of Bank of New England's restructuring plan,
under which the bank is retrenching to raise cash and focus on its
New England operations.
   ``The operation that we have sold is not in New England _ its
offices are outside the region,'' Lavelle said. ``As a New England
regional institution we will be focusing our attention on New
England.''
   He said the sale was made to enhance the company's liquidity,
improve equity capital and contribute to other downsizing efforts.
   Last month the Bank of New England announced that losses for
1989 had hit the $1.11 billion mark, mostly because of bad real
estate loans.
   The company also reported $2.2 billion in non-performing assets
at the end of 1989, and estimated that $1 billion in loans were
performing but borrowers were experiencing financial difficulty.
   As a result of the financial difficulty, the bank signed an
agreement with federal regulators last month that sets tight
guidelines for lending practices and other operations.
   On April 4, the bank announced it would cut 5,600 employees and
slash $300 million in costs in order to strengthen the institution.
   As a part of Tuesday's sale, the National Bank of Canada will
retain most of the subsidiary's employees.
   Boston-based Bank of New England Corp. is an interstate bank
holding company with assets estimated at $25 billion. The
institution has banking offices in four New England states.

<HEAD>Simmons Loses Try For Lockheed Directors, Wins On Shareholders'
Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stockholders have rejected investor Harold
Simmons' plan to win control of Lockheed Corp.'s board, but the
Dallas billionaire says he was pleased with victories on
shareholders' rights issues.
   ``It appears we achieved a clean sweep on the issues of
confidential voting, opting out of the Delaware anti-takeover law,
abolition of the poison pill and anti-greenmail,'' said Simmons,
who controls about 19 percent of Lockheed stock.
   ``The shareholders have spoken clearly on these issues and we
will expect Lockheed's board of directors to take prompt action to
implement the shareholders' wishes,'' he said.
   Simmons, who owns 18.9 percent of Lockheed's common stock, had
sought to replace company directors with his own nominees after his
request for representation had been turned down.
   Citing preliminary tallies, Simmons said the four shareholders'
rights proposals each received 57 percent to 97 percent of the
votes cast at last month's annual shareholders meeting. Incumbent
Lockheed directors were re-elected with between 58 percent and 61
percent of the votes each, he said.
   Lockheed, maker of the stealth fighter and other military
hardware, said its directors won with 62 percent of the overall
vote and 78 percent of the vote of shareholders not controlled by
Simmons. The company also confirmed the outcome of the
shareholders' rights provisions, but did not reveal specifics.
   The election was conducted at the company's March 29 annual
meeting in Burbank, Calif. The results announced Tuesday are
preliminary and final figures won't be available until Monday.
   Of the four proposals, only the one requiring the company to opt
out of Delaware's strict takeover statute is binding.
   The three others are all advisory, although Lockheed Chairman
Daniel Tellep said during the annual meeting that he would work to
implement the confidentiality proposals if supported by a
``significant'' minority of voters.
   Despite the binding nature of the proposal, Tellep said Tuesday
the board would have to review the ``poison pill'' provisions. He
said he is concerned abandoning the pill would leave the company
vulnerable to hostile takeovers.
   Lockheed's ``poison pill'' kicks in once an investor acquires 20
percent of the company's stock. It allows other shareholders to
purchase additional stock at lower prices, diluting the large
investor's holdings.
   Under the takeover law in Delaware, where Lockheed is
incorporated, companies can chose to adopt other provisions that
make hostile takeovers more difficult and expensive, including
limits on sales and mergers involving the company.
   The anti-greenmail proposal would prohibit Lockheed from buying
back its own stock at a premium from selected investors. Instead,
all shareholders must be able to cash in on the higher prices.
   Simmons had undertaken the proxy fight after accumulating the
Lockheed shares, and watching his $530 million investment drop $100
million in value.
   Tellep and the company fought Simmons, claiming he had no
experience running a defense or aerospace company.
   Simmons insisted the company could be managed better and urged
Lockheed to improve profits at non-core business or sell them.
   Simmons, who won some large institutional investors to his side,
attributed the loss in the directors' races to Lockheed's employee
stock ownership plan. The ESOP holds 19 percent of the company's
stock, 90 percent of which was cast for company nominees, he said.
   The ESOP was created last year after Simmons began buying
Lockheed stock through his Houston-based NL Industries Inc.
   ``We feel we did very well for our first try,'' Simmons said.
``Last year, for example, confidential voting received 35 percent
of the votes and this year it received about 60 percent support.
Last year, 27 percent of the votes were cast in favor of opting out
of the Delaware anti-takeover statute. This year the proposal
garnered over 60 percent.''

<TEXT>
   Casting its vote in the growing debate over oil
tanker safety, Conoco Inc. said it will switch to double-hull
tankers to help guard against spills like last year's catastrophe
in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   Conoco said it had placed an order for two double-hull oil
tankers and would order only twin-hull vessels in the future.
   The step was part of a nine-point environmental program the
company unveiled Tuesday that also included efforts to reduce toxic
air emissions.
   ``We are in the business by the public's consent,'' said
Constantine S. Nicandros, Conoco president and chief executive
officer. ``We are sincere in our concern for the air, water and
land of our planet as a matter of enlightened self-interest.''
   Oil companies have faced increasing pressure to switch to
double-hull tankers since the Exxon Valdez ran aground, gushing
nearly 11 million gallons of crude into Alaskan waters in the
nation's worst spill ever. Many politicians and environmentalists
claim a second hull might have averted the spill.
   Many oil industry officials have argued against twin-hull
vessels, claiming that they could be less stable than conventional
tankers if their outer hull is pierced.
   Several panels are studying the issue, including the American
Academy of Sciences, which set to release a report this summer.
   But Nicandros said, ``We cannot wait for a verdict'' from the
study.
   ``We realize that doubled-hulled tankers are not the total
solution, but they do offer an increase margin of protection
against oil spills,'' he was quoted as saying in The New York Times.
   The newspaper quoted Conoco officials as saying they believe it
was the first American oil company to place an order for a
twin-hull tanker.
   As part of its plan, the company also said it would:
   _ Support the creation of citizen advisory councils at all major
installations worldwide to monitor environmental performance.
   _ Reward top managers for emphasizing and implementing plans
that benefit the environment and penalize lack of performance in
the area.
   _ Provide double containment systems at all newly constructed
and renovated gasoline outlets.
   _ Intensify research and development of fuels that improve the
environment.
   _ Create yearlong environmental fellowships to let several
outsiders work within the company on environmental matters.
   _ Emphasize environmental sensitivities in developing oil and
gas discoveries.
   _ Work toward recycling all waste generated at Conoco's
2,500-employee headquarters complex in Houston.
   Conoco is a subsidiary of E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the mid-70s, he was the youngest person ever
selected for the New York advertising copywriters' Hall of Fame. A
dozen years later, he decided he had had enough, quit his agency
and left the business.
   He asked for bids on his collection of cars and art, sold the
midtown Manhattan apartment and dismissed the butler. He went off
to drive in a transcontinental automobile race. He wrote a book
about his adventures.
   And now Ed McCabe is back.
   The former president and creative director of the Scali McCabe
Sloves advertising agency that created award-winning campaigns
ranging from durable cars to tender chickens said Tuesday he has
joined the regional ad agency Beber Silverstein &amp; Partners of Miami.
   McCabe, 51, will become a creative partner and the agency is
changing its name to Beber Silverstein McCabe &amp; Partners.
   ``I'd been in advertising for 32 years and that is a long time
to do any one thing without a break,'' McCabe said in an interview
of his decision to quit the ad business in late 1986.
   He had no intention of getting back into it, but said, ``In
three years of looking around, I haven't found anthing else I would
want to do.''
   McCabe is probably best known for creating the commercials for
Perdue chicken that used the line, ``It takes a tough man to make a
tender chicken.'' The ads helped build the brand and made a
celebrity of founder Frank Perdue.
   He also worked award-winning ads for Volvo automobiles,
stressing their durability and safety. Others included Hebrew
National meats and Maxell tapes.
   He was a co-founder of Scali McCabe Sloves in 1967, and was
elected in 1974 at the age of 35 to the New York Copy Club's
Copywriters Hall of Fame.
   Fellow adman George Lois calls him ``one of the really terrific
copywriters of the past 25 to 30 years.''
   McCabe became a millionaire when Scali McCabe Sloves was
acquired by the company that owned the Ogilvy &amp; Mather ad agency in
1978. He stayed on under new ownership.
   But he decided to leave both the agency and the ad business in
late 1986.
   ``I left because I had done enough with the company. I like to
build things ... But when a thing gets big, it gets less new,'' he
said.
   A few months later, he competed in the grueling Paris-to-Dakar
race that runs 8,000 miles through the Sahara Desert. He dropped
out of the competition on the eighth day of the 21-day race after
falling asleep at the wheel and running out of gas. He said he and
a partner completed the trek anyway.
   The race inspired him to write a book, ``Against Gravity,''
which is expected to be published by Warner Books in June.
   He wrote magazine articles, did consulting work for a British ad
agency in London and looked into starting a film production
company, discarding that idea because of the heavy costs. He was
frustrated by unsuccessful efforts to assist the losing
presidential campaign of Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   He went back to London to finish the book in late 1988, and
returned to the United States last summer to consider his options.
   He decided against starting his own agency because ``I did that
once,'' and against returning to his old agency, now a part of
British-based WPP Group PLC.
   Joyce Beber, one of the founders of Beber Silverstein 18 years
ago, said she had known McCabe for years and approached him earlier
this year about the possibilities of building a regional agency
into a national agency.
   ``I guess I piqued his interest,'' she said.
   Beber Silverstein handles $70 million in annual billings for a
number of clients, including Humana Health Services, Florida Power
&amp; Light, First Florida Banks and FloridaGold Orange Juice.
   The agency also claims credit for casting Leona Helmsley as
``The Queen'' in ads for her Helmsley Hotels. The agency was fired
in 1987. Mrs. Helmsley no longer appears in the ads. She was
convicted on tax evasion charges last year.
   McCabe will split his time between the Miami and New York
offices, and will be chairman of the New York office.
   ``He is an extraordinary talent, and I'm rooting for him,'' said
Marvin Sloves, who founded Scali McCabe with McCabe and remains
with that agency.
   McCabe said he hopes to ``help create on the great indepedent
regional agencies in the country'' while having some fun and making
some money.
   He said the most creative ad work is no longer coming from New
York City but from places like Portland, Ore.; Richmond, Va. and
San Fancisco.
   ``I don't see why Miami shouldn't be right at the top of that
list,'' he said.

Arrangement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Justice Department said it has
entered into a consent decree with Norton Co. and Baker Hughes
Inc., removing the final obstacles to Norton's planned $550 million
sale of Eastman Christenson Co. to Baker Hughes.
   The companies said Tuesday they expected to close the sale
within the next few days.
   To allow the sale to move forward, Justice Department officials
required Baker Hughes, a Houston, Texas-based energy products and
services company, to sell the diamond drill bit business of the
Hughes Tool Co.
   Last year the division sold $17 million in drills, said Ron
Turner, corporate vice president at Baker Hughes. Turner said
several parties had expressed an interest in buying the product
line, but nothing was settled. He declined to name the potential
buyers.
   Eastman Christenson also makes diamond drill bits, but on a
bigger scale, Turner said. Last year the drills earned the company
$40 million in sales, he said.
   ``The part of the (Eastman) business that is not in contention
is a very important part of it,'' Turner said.
   The consent decree stipulates that if the drill business is not
sold by Aug. 6, the business must be placed under the oversight of
a trustee, to manage and sell the company for Baker Hughes.
   ``That's just a legal provision in case the management of the
company decides to stonewall it, a provision that `If you don't do
it we will,' '' Turner said.
   Norton, a leading maker of abrasives such as grinding tools and
sandpaper, is a target of a $1.6 billion, $75 a share hostile
takeover bid from the British conglomerate BTR PLC.
   The Norton board of directors has rejected the offer, but BTR
PLC has threatened to take control of the board at the company's
upcoming annual meeting.
   Frank Doherty, a Norton spokesman, denied the Eastman
Christenson sale had anything to do with defensive maneuvering.
   ``It's not related to BTR. We announced it Dec. 15th and this is
just the final step,'' Doherty said. ``It just happens to be
completed now.''

<TEXT>
   Bechtel Group Inc. has won a contract from
the Hong Kong government to manage a $16 billion construction
project scheduled for completion in 1997, when the Chinese
government will take over Hong Kong from England.
   The company announced the contract Tuesday but did not disclose
how much it would be paid to oversee and coordinate the project
which is to include a new airport, the world's longest suspension
bridge, a harbor tunnel, and a rail transit system.
   Michael K. Stephenson, a Bechtel senior vice president, said the
company purposely focused on taking an oversight role rather than
that of a contractor in making its bid.
   ``Our track record and world experience in moving major
megaprojects together on time and within budget (was) one of the
factors'' in winning the contract, Stephenson said.
   Stephen D. Bechtel Jr., company chairman, said in a memo to
employees: ``The development is comparable to Saudi Arabia's Jubail
Industrial City in complexity and diversity.''
   Bechtel's plans to manage the Hong Kong project rank second only
to the company's involvement in the creation of the Saudi Arabian
city _ the largest construction project in history. Bechtel became
involved in the Saudi Arabian city, still being built, in the late
1970s.

<TEXT>
   The government sold $3.5 billion of 40-year
bonds to finance the bailout of the savings and loan industry but
traders said the auction was disappointing.
   The bonds were sold Tuesday at an average yield of 8.89 percent,
up from 8.60 percent at the last auction Jan. 23. The bonds will
carry a coupon interest rate of 8~ percent with a $10,000 bond
selling for $9,983.40.
   The Resolution Funding Corp., or Refcorp, received bids totaling
$8.90 billion, compared with $8.17 billion in bids in January for
what was a larger issue of $5 billion.
   Nevertheless, traders said the bonds were poorly received. The
government could not sell all of the bonds at the low bid of 8.86
percent and had to sell some for as much as 8.94 percent.
   ``It was a poor reception,'' said economist Robert Brusca of
Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   He said bond buyers were worried about the extra interest rate
risk of the longer maturity. They were fearful that the S&amp;L problem
is worse than anticipated and the government will have to flood the
market with borrowing, he said.
   Treasury Department officials had been hoping institutional
investors such as pension funds would show more demand for the
longer maturity, thus allowing the government to offer a lower
interest rate.
   Legislation in August authorized the government to borrow $30
billion through Refcorp, an arrangement that keeps the spending out
of the budget deficit.
   Refcorp has now borrowed $13 billion. The first bond auction,
for $4.5 billion in 30-year bonds, was in October.

<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans by the parent company of Credit
Suisse to take a majority stake in 235-year-old Bank Leu AG signals
the onset of a consolidation of Switzerland's banking industry,
analysts and bankers said.
   CS Holding, parent of the country's No. 3 commercial bank Credit
Suisse, and Bank Leu, the fifth-biggest bank and the oldest major
Swiss bank, announced Tuesday they are holding talks aimed at
setting up a new holding company.
   The holding company, which would be listed on stock exchanges,
would include Bank Leu and two small CS Holding investment
management companies, Bank Hofmann and Clariden Bank, with all
units retaining their identities.
   Nikolaus Senn, president of Union Bank of Switzerland, predicted
further mergers in the Swiss banking industry will follow.
   The pace of concentration ``will even intensify,'' the head of
Switzerland's biggest commercial bank said.
   The high cost of competing internationally will lead to deep
changes in Swiss and European banking, Zurich financial analyst
Thomas Braun said.
   ``Big banks will swallow the smaller ones, and the small ones
will band together,'' he said.
   Bank Leu, with assets of 15 billion francs, the equivalent of
about $10 billion, has faced takeover rumblings in the past. It has
recently undergone a management shakeup and corporate
restructuring, and analysts say it has improved potential to
develop its private client base.
   The joint announcement said CS Holding group has built up a
``substantial shareholding in Bank Leu over the past two years.''
It did not reveal the size of the stake.
   Shares of the new holding company would be swapped for equities
of Bank Leu, at a ratio to be set later, and CS Holding would end
up with a majority interest in the new concern.
   Assuming that CS Holding controls at least half of the voting
shares of Leu, analysts estimated the value of the stake at up to 1
billion Swiss francs, or about $675 million dollars.

<HEAD>USX Threatens Closing South Works Without Concessions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note language in graf 5.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. says it is considering shuttering the
remnants of its rusting South Works steel mill, a move that would
idle 700 workers, unless union officials agree to major concessions
by the end of the year.
   The struggling Chicago facility can't compete with new non-union
plants unless fixed costs are substantially reduced, said USX
Chairman Charles Corry.
   The company wants workers to give up benefits and jobs under a
new labor contract to take effect Jan. 1.
   But union leaders angrily rejected Corry's plea for concessions.
   ``My position is they can go to hell,'' said Willie Ross,
president of United Steelworkers of America Local 65, on Tuesday.
``They can close the damn thing. It comes to the point where we're
giving and giving and giving and we've got nothing left to give.''
   South Works once employed 18,000 workers and has made steel
since 1881 under USX's U.S. Steel Co. unit and predecessor
companies.
   Once an integral part of Chicago's heavy industry, the plant
fell victim to recession and a slump in the domestic steel industry.
   All that remains amid vacant buildings on the 574-acre facility
are two electric furnaces and a mill that makes about 14.6 tons of
raw steel each week. Technology there is more than a generation old.
   The company has proposed eliminating a shift of workers and
allowing other shops to finish business, a move that would trim
union employment to 300 workers, Ross said.
   Corry says the company needs the concessions to compete with
new, smaller mills that make finished steel from scrap, at lower
costs.
   The so-called ``mini mills,'' like the non-union Nucor Corp. of
Charlotte, N.C. and Northwestern Steel &amp; Wire of Sterling, Ill.,
are expanding, and analysts say they'll likely crowd the
marketplace.
   ``That's going to play havoc for the market,'' said Christopher
Plummer, an analyst with WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   ``Clearly, the writing is on the wall for mini-mills to be
taking a significant portion of the market in the future, and
somebody's going to have to drop out eventually,'' Plummer said.
   ``We want to be in it if we can earn return on our investment,''
Corry said. ``If you were to tell me we were going to lose money in
structural the next three years, I'd say it's not a business we
want to be in.''

<HEAD>Crop Futures Mostly Higher on USDA Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were mostly higher in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly in
reaction to a government report indicating the nation's grain
stockpiles are shrinking.
   Gains in the soybean market were limited by pronounced weaknes
in the soybean meal pit, where traders sold futures contracts amid
expectations for an increase in Brazilian meal exports.
   In a report released after the close of Tuesday's trading, the
Agriculture Department substantially lowered its forecasts for
ending stocks of U.S. corn and soybeans and slightly reduced its
wheat stocks projection.
   The USDA estimated Sept. 1 corn stocks at 1.33 billion bushels,
down from last month's estimate of 1.48 billion.
   Sept. 1 soybean stocks were pegged at 305 million bushels
compared with the March projection of 330 million.
   The USDA projected June 1 wheat stocks at 442 million bushels
compared with last month's estimate of 443 million.
   Brazilian exports of soybean meal are expected to increase due
to a 15 percent devaluation of that country's currency, making
Brazilian meal cheaper on the world market, said Victor Lespinasse,
a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were \ cent lower to 4\
cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.66\ a
bushel; corn was \ cent to 1\ cents higher with May at $2.73 a
bushel; oats were \ cent lower to { cent higher with May at $1.51\
a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 3{ cents higher with May at
$5.93\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The April live
cattle contract set a new record high of 80.35 cents a bushel
shortly after the opening.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .10 cent higher with April at
80.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .18 cent lower
with April at 84.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .58
cent higher with April at 55.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .83 cent to 1.58 cent higher with May at 57.15 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled higher across the board on
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Farley Reportedly to Surrender Majority Ownership of Pepperell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrialist William Farley plans to surrender
majority ownership of West Point-Pepperell Inc. by proposing a
debt-equity swap to reduce the costs of his troubled takeover
efforts, a newspaper reported today.
   Farley, who holds 95 percent of the textile giant's stock, is
offering certain debt holders a combined stake of 65 percent in a
restructured version of Pepperell, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing sources it did not identify.
   The transfer would help reduce and delay certain interest
payments and might be the only way Farley can avoid bankruptcy, the
Journal's sources said.
   Farley couldn't be reached for immediate comment. The spokesmen
at the Farley Inc. headquarters in Chicago were traveling today, a
secretary said, and they did not return telephone messages.
   The arrangement would create a new parent company, West Point
Holdings Corp., which would hold the stock in the operating unit,
the newspaper said. Although the new entity would apparently be a
unit of Farley Inc., the debt-equity swap would leave Farley a
minority shareholder, according to the Journal.
   The newspaper said it was not clear whether the preferred shares
held by Farley would allow him to retain control of Pepperell, but
it said it's believed he would keep majority control of the boards
of directors at West Point Holdings and the Pepperell operating
unit.
   Farley acquired control of Pepperell in March 1989 and holds 95
percent of the company's stock, but he has had trouble raising
about $83 million needed to acquire the remaining 5 percent.
   The newspaper said his bankers are likely to lend him the cash
needed to complete the deal if certain debt holders agree to the
debt-for-equity plan.
   Meantime, analysts said the $96.5 million sale of Pepperell's
Sanderson subsidiary won't be of much help to Farley. Georgia-based
Pepperell on Tuesday announced the sale of its U.K. Division,
Arthur Sanderson and Sons Ltd., to the Dutch textile group Gamma
Holding N.V.
   ``It looks like a very good price,'' said Richard J. Byrne of
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York. ``It helps, but it's a small step.
They need to complete the merger.''
   ``He is still highly leveraged,'' said Rich Mercier of Standard
&amp; Poor. The $96.5 million ``is not a meaningful number when you're
talking over $2 billion in debt.''
   The collapse of the junk bond market has dealt a severe blow to
Farley's expansion plans. Last week, the Farley subsidiary formed
to acquire Pepperell announced it had defaulted on $1.5 billion
worth of loan and bond payments.
   Farley has been trying to restructure a $796 million loan
obtained from a consortium of banks for the Pepperell buyout.
   Farley's other properties include Fruit of the Loom Inc. and
Acme Boots. Pepperell manufactures apparel and bedding sold under
such brands as Ralph Lauren, Martex, Lady Pepperell, Esprit and
Utica.

   The stock market showed a small gain today with
encouragement from a drop in interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.93 to 2,734.01 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers held a narrow edge on losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 666 up, 622 down and
512 unchanged.
   In the credit markets today, prices of long-term Treasury bonds
rose nearly $5 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their yields
to the 8.54 percent-8.60 percent range.
   That reversed an increase in rates Tuesday that occurred as a
sale of 40-year savings institution ``bailout'' bonds drew an
unenthusiastic reception.
   Meanwhile, analysts said traders were proceeding cautiously as
they watched the first corporate earnings reports for the
January-March quarter come in.
   The numbers are expected to be downbeat, for the most part,
reflecting persistent weakness in economic growth.
   However, Federal National Mortgage climbed 1 to 35&lsqb; on news of

.12 to 187.75. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.53 at 357.99.

<TEXT>
   The dollar ended European dealings Wednesday
broadly weaker, in part because of renewed interest in the West
German mark.
   Gold prices declined.
   The dollar was quoted at 1.6735 West German marks late in
London, down sharply from 1.6900 marks late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.35 Japanese yen to a
closing 158.50 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 158.15 yen.
   A flurry of dollar selling against the yen by some European
central banks breathed some life into an otherwise dull European
session. The intervention, which came in early afternoon, had
little impact on the dollar's level against the yen.
   While dealers saw the intervention as orders executed on behalf
of the Bank of Japan rather than any concerted effort by the Group
of Seven (G-7) nations to stem yen weakness, they also noted that
Japanese commercial buying was among the more active features in
the European day.
   ``If we hadn't had the intervention I think the market would
have died earlier,'' said Michael James, head of inter-bank dealing
for Midland Bank. ``We could be in for some quiet range trading
over the next few weeks.''
   The British pound, meanwhile, was quoted at $1.6427 late in
London compared with $1.6345 late Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates in Europe compared with late Tuesd; 1-2 300-500

<HEAD>MacWorld Exposition Opens to Uncertainty About Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opening of the fifth annual MacWorld
Exposition was greeted eagerly within computer circles, but product
developers at the convention hall expressed uncertainty about the
market for Macintosh computers.
   Industry insiders in attendance Tuesday complained there was
little groundbreaking technology at the show, which usually
features hot new products and applications for the Apple Computer
Inc. machine.
   ``I don't know of anything really exciting that's going on, so I
don't know if the market is going to be able to grow this year,''
said Mike Slade, Macintosh products manager for Microsoft Corp. of
Redmond, Wash., the leading supplier of Macintosh software.
   According to Macintosh product developers, growth in the
Macintosh market will remain crippled until Apple comes to market
with a low-cost Mac.
   ``The technical strength is at the high end, and there are
people who will always buy that,'' said Michael McConnell,
president of SuperMac Technology Inc., a Sunnyvale supplier of
Macintosh monitors and software.
   ``But the high end is now where the volumes are, and in the long
run the Macintosh won't become a mainstream computer without a
low-end product,'' said McConnell.
   According to InfoCorp, a Santa Clara market research company,
Macintosh shipments are expected to increase only 8 percent this
year to 749,000 units. Last year, sales grew 34 percent to 693,000
units.
   At the convention, some products did manage to draw attention.
   Aaps Corp., headed by Atari Corp. and PizzaTime Theater founder
Nolan Bushnell, displayed its DigiVideo computer board, which
allows a Macintosh to act as a video cassette recorder. The
98-channel tuner _ which costs $595 _ and video recorder may be
important to desktop publishers who use video images.
   SuperMac Technology Inc. unveiled the first 21-inch color
monitor for a Mac. The color monitor, priced at $4,799, could
become a popular item for sophisticated publishing systems that
require users to view two color pages simultaneously.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Prices Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices continued to slide in
early trading today but managed to recoup some of their losses.
   The contract for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, was down 25 cents to $17.43 a
barrel in early afternoon on the New York Mercantile Exchange after
having fallen $1.47 over Monday and Tuesday. The May contract fell
as much as $1.43 in early trading today before regaining some
ground.
   Refined products traded on the Merc also fell today.
   The May contract for unleaded regular gasoline was down 1.13
cents to 57.30 a gallon after a drop of 3.68 cents over Monday and
Tuesday. Gasoline followed the lead of crude, recovering some of
its losses after falling 2.83 cents earlier.
   Home heating oil for May delivery was down 0.05 cent to 52.35
cents a gallon after slipping 1.31 cents over Monday and Tuesday.
Heating oil fared the best among petroleum futures today, retracing
most of its steps after having fallen 2.40 cents in early trading.
   Energy futures prices have fallen in recent weeks to their
lowest levels in more than a year. Analysts blame the decline on
plentiful supplies and production while demand has been weaker than
expected.
   The analysts cited reports that indicate the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries has been producing an average 24
million barrels of oil a day. That is above the ceiling of 22.1
million barrels a day that OPEC members agreed on for production in
the first half of this year.
   Some OPEC members, led by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait,
have been ignoring their production quotas and calling for their
abolition.
   Another factor cited by analysts is the end of normal
maintenance periods for many U.S. oil refineries, which are
expected to increase their output.
   At the same time, the analysts said demand for oil has been weak
with big customers either placing smaller orders because of weak
business conditions or postponing purchases in anticipation of
further price declines.
   Meanwhile, natural gas for June delivery was quoted at $1.605
per million British thermal units today on the Merc, down from
$1.620 on Tuesday.

<HEAD>June Ruling Expected in Computer Chip Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge said he will decide in
June whether a key Motorola Inc. computer chip should be pulled off
the market until a lawsuit over the chip's patent is resolved.
   U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton of Midland said Tuesday he
will rule June 18 on a motion filed by Hitachi Ltd., the Japanese
electronics giant and former Motorola partner, to temporarily halt
the sale of the popular Motorola microprocessor, which is made in
Austin.
   Motorola and Hitachi have been embroiled in a 16-month legal
battle over trade secrets that centers on some of their most
popular computer microprocessors.
   Motorola's device, the 68030 microprocessor, is the company's
best-selling chip, generating 1989 sales of more than $100 million.
   On March 29, Bunton banned the sale of the chip and fined both
companies for violating each other's patents. The sales
prohibition, though, was reversed one day later after Motorola
argued that the move could devastate outside computer makers, which
depend on the Motorola chips to run their machines.
   Hours after Bunton announced plans to rule on the case in June,
executives from both companies agreed to meet in Chicago late
Tuesday to discuss a possible settlement, the Austin
American-Statesman reported. Motorola spokesman Chuck Sengstock
said Wednesday he had no comment on the report.

<TEXT>
   It happens every spring: the first robin
appears, baseball players return to the diamond and Evelyn Y. Davis
heckles corporate honchos at annual shareholders' meetings across
the country.
   She has exasperated Chrysler Corp.'s Lee Iacocca with unsought
diet advice. Her diatribes helped convince Citicorp to limit
shareholder questions to three minutes each. She once gave May
Department Stores Co. Chairman David C. Farrell a $1,600 check and
the warning: ``David, please make sure your man is on time when he
comes to hang my drapes. I'm a busy woman.''
   Several years ago she nominated soft-porn actress Koo Stark _
then romantically linked with Britain's Prince Andrew _ to ITT
Corp.'s board of directors to give the communications conglomerate
``some much needed influence with the British royal family.''
   Since 1959 when she first stood _ ``shaking like a leaf'' _ to
ask a question at an IBM Corp. shareholders meeting, the
60-year-old diminutive redhead with the abrasive high-pitched voice
has been questioning, needling, cajoling, cursing and irritating
corporate America's top guns in front of hundreds of other
stockholders at about 60 meetings a year.
   Moreover, the executives listen _ they don't like it _ but they
listen because Evelyn Y. Davis has clout.
   How much clout?
   Well, for example, she got General Motors Corp., the nation's
largest industrial company, to agree last month to adopt an
anti-greenmail policy she'd been pushing since 1986 when the
automaker paid $700 million to Texas businessman H. Ross Perot so
he would leave GM's board of directors.
   Greenmail, a play on the term blackmail, is a company's
re-purchase of its own stock from a corporate takeover strategist
or other unwanted stockholder at a price above the fair market rate.
   Shareholder activists such as Davis complain that these payments
are unfair and unnecessary expenditures made by executives more
concerned with keeping their own jobs than increasing shareholders'
dividends.
   ``Sometimes it takes that type of person or that type of
approach to get management's attention,'' said Ralph Whitworth,
director of United Shareholders Association, a Washington-based
shareholders rights group.
   ``I think some of the things she has done have been
constructive,'' said Whitworth, whose own group has advocated
proposals it says are intended to keep management honest and
responsible.
   ``It's unfortunate that management has been able to put in place
the belief that anyone who gets up and asks a question at a meeting
is a gadfly,'' he said.
   Davis doesn't mind.
   ``A gadfly with a fortune,'' she reminded in an emphatic voice,
still heavy with the accent of her native Amsterdam. ``You know
this stuff has made me quite wealthy,'' she said.
   ``But what I like too is this power that this gives me. The
power. That's really what life is all about,'' she said. ``It's all
how you use it. It's better than being a non-entity. I couldn't
stand being a nonentity.''
   Davis, however, is not just another eccentric, comfortably-fixed
senior citizen with a few shares of stock and time on her hands.
   She's a millionaire, a couple of times over, with small holdings
in about 120 blue chip companies ranging from the Big Three
automakers to IBM, CBS Inc. and USX Corp.
   The seed money came from some securities left by her late father
and settlements from two divorces.
   ``My stocks are my children,'' said Davis, who is childless. ``I
sort of just fell into it.''
   Her early personal history remains somewhat of a mystery, and
Davis is reluctant to talk about it. She emigrated to the United
States after World War II. She studied business administration at
George Washington University and said she honed her public speaking
skills with a $20 YMCA course.
   From a tiny, windowless office in Washington's Watergate complex
she publishes an annual newsletter called ``Highlights and
Lowlights,'' sold only to top corporate executives, which she says
earns about $250,000 a year.
   ``I started from nothing. The first few copies were maybe 20
bucks a copy. Now I get $260 a copy with a minimum order of two
copies. Its only sold to chairmen of the board and presidents,''
she said. ``I don't deal with flunkies.''
   The 20-page newsletter is packed with corporate commentary,
social notes and eccentric punctuation that rivals Superman comics
for the number of exclamation points _ all vintage Evelyn Y. Davis,
who said the Y does not stand for anything.
   A sampling from the 1989 edition:
   _ At one of the most important meetings of the year only ONE
``outside'' director, the son of the founder, attended!!! Time
Inc.!!!! This showed disrespect for the chairman, the stockholders
and other attendees!!
   _ What happened in China was very unfortunate indeed, BUT
business MUST go on as usual. As long as we have diplomatic
relations with a country, we should continue to do business even
with unpopular regimes!!!
   _ In Mexico City and Acapulco one STILL has to worry about the
food and water. We were there once before in 1966!! With all the
taxpayers' money that is going to Mexico, why not insist that it is
spent on water PURIFICATION!!
   Despite her vociferous push for shareholder rights, Davis
remains largely a loner, with no clearly defined political
leanings. But she bluntly has distanced herself from shareholder
groups pushing social resolutions such as South African divestment
and sensitivity to the environment.
   ``After all, a company is there to make money, not to be
socially responsible,'' she said. ``That's for the government to
do.''
   Davis' office is cluttered with letters, annual reports and some
of the five newspapers she reads each day to keep tabs on her
stocks as well as nearly 1,000 other companies.
   Her yellow and blue plaid jacket is by Valentino while the gold
turtleneck dress beneath it is by Nipon _ purchased at half price.
   ``Fashion is a hobby _ but only on sale,'' she said.
   Davis seems equally willing to cause a scene with a waiter or a
CEO, as she demonstrated during a recent interview.
   ``With a woman they say she's difficult and demanding. With a
man they wouldn't think so,'' Davis said after kicking up a fuss
with a hapless waiter in the elegant Brighton Grill of the
Watergate where she lives in a cluttered three-room apartment.
   Through her newsletter, she has obtained press credentials that
have given her access to newsmakers well beyond the corporate
world. For example, she has a White House press identification and
has popped a few questions to Presidents Reagan and Bush.
   But one of her proudest moments was what she termed ``a six
minute chat'' with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev a few years ago
in Moscow, where she had been invited as part of a U.S.-Soviet
trade delegation.
   During a banquet, Davis recalled, she walked over to Gorbachev's
table and complained she hadn't been invited to a news conference.
``He said he'd look into it,'' she said.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans see-sawed to
a mixed close Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn futures
turned in a surprisingly weak performance in light of a shrinking
national corn stockpile.
   Traders had expected corn futures to rally after Tuesday's
monthly Agriculture Department supply-and-demand report, which
projected Sept. 1 corn stocks of 1.33 million bushels, down from
March's estimate of 1.48 billion.
   The USDA also lowered its estimates of wheat and soybean stocks,
but those numbers came close to market expectations.
   Corn futures opened lower and quickly turned higher but sold off
again in the afternoon after traders tried and failed to bid prices
above their previous contract highs, said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The contract for December delivery traded up to its lifetime
high of $2.63{ a bushel but the rally failed at that point,
prompting speculative profit-taking, Lespinasse said.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 2{
cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.64{ a
bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to \ cent higher with May at $2.71{
a bushel; oats were unchanged to \ cent lower with May at $1.50} a
bushel; soybeans were 1\ cents to 3{ cents higher with May at

   The stock market declined slightly today in a
drifting session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.38 to 2,727.70
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 648 up, 799 down and
499 unchanged.
   In the credit markets today, prices of long-term Treasury bonds
rose slightly, lowering their yields to the 8.56 percent-8.62
percent range.
   That reversed an increase in rates Tuesday that occurred as a
sale of 40-year savings institution ``bailout'' bonds drew an
unenthusiastic reception.
   Meanwhile, analysts said traders were proceeding cautiously as
they watched the first corporate earnings reports for the
January-March quarter come in.
   The numbers are expected to be downbeat, for the most part,
reflecting persistent weakness in economic growth.
   However, Federal National Mortgage climbed } to 34~ on news of
higher first-quarter profits.
   Energy stocks declined broadly, weighed down by recent weakness
in world oil prices. Mobil dropped } to 59~; Amoco 1&lsqb; to 50\;
Texaco ~ to 57{; Atlantic Richfield 2&lsqb; to 113, and Phillips
Petroleum { to 25&rsqb;.
   Among oil service issues, Schlumberger lost 1 to 50; Baker
Hughes 1\ to 26, and Halliburton &rsqb; to 43}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.22 to 187.41. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.22 at 357.30.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 120.39 million shares with an

<HEAD>Security Pacific Reports Higher Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security Pacific Corp. reported Wednesday
that its first quarter profit rose 5 percent, due mainly to strong
results at its core Security Pacific Bank, California's second
largest bank.
   For the three months ended March 31, the bank holding company
earned $188.4 million, compared with $179.3 million a year ago.
Per-share earnings were unchanged at $1.54 because there is more
common stock outstanding this year, the company said.
   Taxable net interest income for the first quarter rose 2 percent
from the year-earlier period, to $746.6 million. Quarterly
non-interest income rose 11 percent to $479.6 million.
   ``The continuing growth and strength in our primary markets in
California produced the second best quarterly net income in
Security Pacific history,'' Robert H. Smith, Security Pacific's
chief executive said in a statement.
   ``We expect continued growth for the corporation throughout the
year.''
   Security Pacific has shown strong results recently despite
losses at its Arizona unit due to the collapse of that state's real
estate market.
   ``A significant improvement is expected in 1990 from the $142
million loss reported in Arizona in 1989,'' said John F. Kooken,
the holding company's chief financial officer.
   Total assets rose 6 percent over the first quarter of 1989, to
$86.5 million from $81.6 million.
   Non-performing loans and leases totaled $1.74 billion on March
31, up from $1.64 billion on Dec. 31 and $1.59 billion on March 31,
1989.

<HEAD>When Tough Times Means $1.55 Million a Year On Wall Street</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Where else but on Wall Street does a drastic pay
cut still leave earnings of $1.55 million a year?
   That was the salary and bonus for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Chairman
William A. Schreyer, down 38 percent from $2.5 million in 1988. It
was no surprise, because the nation's No. 1 brokerage lost money
for the first time since going public in 1971.
   In a bad year for the securities industry, cash compensation for
highly paid top executives reflected the fortunes of individual
firms, proxy statements issued by publicly owned brokerages show.
   Some firms did better than others in coping with a downturn in
stock trading, mergers and takeovers and other barometers of Wall
Street's financial health. Payouts ballooned accordingly.
   At Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., which made a $443 million profit, the
top three executives took home $5.475 million apiece, a 26 percent
raise over 1988, not including free stock they may have cashed in.
   Morgan's top five made more than $3 million each. Its eight
executive officers combined to make $28.7 million.
   Top executives at Wall Street firms usually are paid according
to the firm's performance, receiving a minimum salary and a bonus.
Payouts are set by compensation committees that include directors
and executives.
   But stock awards and options given to top executives generally
inflate earnings. So in spite of lower cash payouts, the upper
echelons generally do better than the rest of their firms, Wall
Street analysts said.
   ``Those CEOs that have earned less money have probably suffered
in a lesser proportion than the rest of the firm,'' Joan Zimmerman,
executive vice president at GZ Stephens Inc., a Wall Street
executive recruiting firm, said Wednesday.
   Overall, bonuses below the executive level on Wall Street last
year were flat to down 20 percent, recruiters said, and were as
much as 50 percent lower in some areas. A 10 percent bonus hike _
considered peanuts in the booming mid-1980s _ last year was a sign
of high regard.
   Despite Merrill's bad year _ the firm lost $213 million in 1989
_ four executives still made more than $1 million, compared with
seven executives the year before.
   ``When things don't go well they still make a lot of money, but
they make a little less than when they do go well,'' said Gary
Goldstein, president of The Whitney Group, another search firm.
   Members of the Morgan troika _ chairman S. Parker Gilbert,
president Richard B. Fisher and vice chairman Robert F. Greenhill _
each were outearned by Ernst Weil, an executive vice president at
Salomon Inc., who received $6.4 million.
   Weil's compensation represented a 60 percent pay raise and
didn't include a $1.6 million deferred bonus to be paid over two
years, according to Salomon's proxy statement.
   What made Weil Salomon's top executive, let alone the highest
paid of Wall Street's boardroom bigwigs? He runs Salomon's Phibro
Energy oil trading and refining subsidiary, which was responsible
most of Salomon's profits in an otherwise mediocre year.
   Salomon Chairman John H. Gutfreund took a $500,000 pay cut to
$3.5 million.
   ``The philosophy on Wall Street has been you pay people to make
you money,'' said Perrin Long, who follows the securities industry
for Lipper Analytical Services. ``As long as they're making the
company money, that's all that's important.''
   According to the proxies, the biggest pay jump belonged to
PaineWebber Inc. chairman Donald B. Marron, who was paid $2.05
million, 64 percent more than in 1988. The firm's profits rose 23
percent.
   Presidents and chairmen aren't necessarily the best-paid players
on Wall Street. Traders who generate large amounts of business
typically received bonuses commensurate with their performance.
   An extreme example is former Drexel Lambert Inc. junk bond
director Michael Milken, who for more than a decade received a
fixed percentage of income generated by the high-yield bond
division. He was paid $550 million in 1987 alone.
   Wall Street firms are expected to use the industry downturn as a
reason for continuing to trim compensation in 1990, their largest
expense, analysts said.
   ``The concern is that on average they will not be able in 1990
to increase their revenue much if any, yet costs continue to
rise,'' Long said. ``As a consequence, (profit) margins are
squeezed.''

<HEAD>Fannie Mae's Profit Up 67 Percent in First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest investor in home
mortgages, the Federal National Mortgage Association, on Wednesday
reported record first- quarter profit of $277 million, up 67
percent from the same period last year.
   Fannie Mae attributed the increase mostly to higher interest
income on all investments and the success of mortgage-backed
securities, which surpassed last year's first-quarter total by 54
percent.
   The first-quarter net income of $277 million, or $1.06 a share,
compared with $165 million, or 66 cents a share, in the first
quarter of 1989.
   ``Fannie Mae's ninth consecutive quarter of record earnings was
based on solid fundamentals,'' said Chief Executive Officer David
O. Maxwell. ``We issued the largest volume of mortgage-backed
securities in any first quarter, and, properties acquired through
foreclosures dropped to their lowest level since peaking in 1987.''
   Fannie Mae foreclosed on 2,455 properties in the first quarter
of this year, a 44 percent decline from the third quarter of 1987.
There were 2,975 foreclosures in the first quarter of 1989.
   The guaranty fees from these securities increased to $121
million in the first quarter of 1990 from $111 million in the
fourth quarter of 1989 and $94 million in the first quarter of 1989.
   Fannie Mae also said earnings were up due to fees of $18.5
million earned from issuing mortgage investment securities and
stripped mortgage-backed securities. This miscellaneous income in
both the first and fourth quarters of 1989 was adversely affected
by several ``non-recurring charges,'' the company said.
   The congressionally chartered, shareholder-owned company
reported 240,530,000 outstanding shares at the end of March.

<HEAD>CBS Posts 52 Percent Profit Gain in 1st Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. said Wednesday its broadcasts of the
Super Bowl and the NCAA basketball tournament fueled a 52 percent
increase in its first-quarter profit despite disappointing ratings
for its prime time entertainment lineup.
   But Laurence A. Tisch, the CBS president and chief executive,
said the company's second-half outlook is ``uncertain due to a
sluggish national economy, heightened competition for television
viewers and higher sports rights costs.''
   CBS, which operates the CBS Television Network and owns five TV
stations, said it earned $85.3 million, or $3.31 per share, in the
three months ended March 31 compared with $56.1 million, or $2.18 a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 16 percent to $851 million from $730.6 million in
1989.
   The operating profit at the company's broadcast group climbed 89
percent to $87.1 million.
   The company said the broadcast of the Super Bowl pro football
championship in January helped the television network report
``markedly higher'' sales and operating income for the quarter.
   The network also benefitted from strong advertiser demand for
time during the NCAA basketball tournament broadcasts and the shift
into the first quarter of the tournament's semifinal games, CBS
said. The championship game was played April 2, two days into the
second quarter.
   Profitability of the CBS television stations was aided by the
Super Bowl broadcast, the company said.
   Tisch called the network's primetime ratings performance a
``disappointment.'' The network generally has trailed both NBC and
ABC in the ratings for the evening audiences for the past three
seasons. Networks can usually charge advertisers more when they
have higher ratings.
   The company said it had net interest income of $41.7 million in
the latest quarter, up from $39.4 million a year earlier.
   Its cash and marketable securities amounted to $2.9 billion at
the end of the quarter, CBS said. It has generated the cash through
sale over the past few years of several large businesses, including
its magazines, records and music publishing operations.
   In the past few months, CBS has agreed to pay about $3.6 billion
for rights to broadcast major league baseball, pro football,
college basketball and the next two Winter Olympics.

<TEXT>
   The dollar ended narrowly mixed Wednesday in
thin trading as dealers shrugged off continued efforts by some
European central banks to shore up the Japanese yen at the expense
of the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices fell.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $374.30 a troy ounce, down 70 cents from late
Tuesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $374.75 an ounce, 75 cents lower.
   Currency dealers said the dollar selling against the yen by some
European central banks had little impact on the dollar's level
against the yen, which has been under pressure in recent weeks amid
growing signs of a weakening Japanese economy.
   Most dealers said they saw the intervention, which followed a
similar move on Monday, as orders executed on behalf of the Bank of
Japan rather than any concerted effort by the Group of Seven
industrialized nations to stem the yen's weakness.
   ``It was a token appearance,'' said Zlatko Glamuzina, chief
dealer at the New York office of Banco di Sicilia. ``If the central
banks wanted to support the yen, they should have sold their own
currencies for yen ... because the yen is weak against all
currencies.''
   Trading was described as extremely thin Wednesday because of the
Passover holiday and in advance of the upcoming Easter holiday.
   In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar rose
0.35 Japanese yen to close at 158.50 yen. It was later quoted at
158.15 yen in London and at 157.95 yen in New York, up from 157.60
yen late Tuesday.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling bought
$1.6427 in London, up from $1.6345; and $1.6425 in New York, down
from $1.6451 Tuesday.
   Against the West German mark, the dollar fell to 1.6735 marks in
London from 1.6900 marks Tuesday. It traded at 1.6720 marks in New
York, down from 1.6750.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.4800 Swiss francs, down from 1.4830;
5.6210 French francs, down from 5.6285; 1,230.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,230.16; and 1.1644 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1692.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday: 1.4835 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4955; 5.6255 French francs, down from 5.6750;
1.8870 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9030; 1,231.75 Italian lire,
down from 1,240.00; and 1.1648 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1613.
   Gold traded in London at $374.75 an ounce, down from late
Tuesday's bid of $375.15. In Zurich, Switzerland, the bid for gold
fell to $374 an ounce from $375.25.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.84 to close at a bid of
$375.13 an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.129 a troy ounce, up from $5.091
late Tuesday. Silver fell in London to $5.11 an ounce from $5.13.

   Decomposition of fire-retardant plywood installed in townhouses
in many East Coast states is setting off a legal battle that could
last years before the courts assign liability for repair bills,
officials said Wednesday.
   Builders primarily used the fire-resistant treated plywood in
townhouses during the housing boom of the early 1980s, said Bill
Young, the consumer affairs director for the Washington-based
National Association of Home Builders.
   Builders in other parts of the nation used a code that had not
yet permitted use of the treated plywood, also known as FRTP, he
said.
   Attorneys for builders and homeowner associations are suing
dozens of wood treatment companies and homeowners' warranty
companies seeking payment of the $2,000 to $3,000 needed to replace
the defective plywood in each of 1 million units Young estimates
have the treated product.
   ``It's such a mess, a real monster lawsuit,'' said Peter
Reinhart, an attorney representing one of New Jersey's largest
developers, K. Hovnanian Inc. He said he expects the unraveling of
the cases to take at least five years.
   Not all the plywood is defective. Researchers are conducting
tests at the U.S. Forest Products Laboratory in Madison, Wis., to
determine the weaker strains of treated plywood, which Young said
was used in multifamily housing.
   Although lawsuits are pending in Connecticut and Florida, New
Jersey seems to be a special focus of the litigation _ 45 lawsuits
_ because the problem was first discovered there in 1987, said E.
Richard Kennedy, a homeowner association attorney who is handling
more than 30 cases in New Jersey.
   Reinhart said K. Hovnanian began seeking relief in the courts
after two workers were injured at a condominium in the town of
Lawrenceville when a roof gave way, costing $750,000 in repair.
   Reinhart blamed much of the legal fight on homeowner warranty
corporations unwilling to pay for the repairs.
   ``They say it's not a major structural defect,'' Reinhart said.
``It's crazy. All the homeowners are looking for is somebody to pay
the repairs.''
   Ken Kanline, the vice president of sales and marketing for
Washington-based Homeowners Warranty Corp., said the policies
written since 1981 have not included roof sheathing as a major
structural defect after the first year.
   He said the company made its decision before problems arose with
the plywood and because too often the warping was cosmetic.
   ``You had a situation where in the sixth year of a home it
wouldn't be a structural claim, but it looked cosmetically
unsightly,'' he said.
   Kanline said the company had received about 120 claims from
Virginia and New Jersey, all of which were rejected.
   New Jersey state Sen. Thomas Paterniti introduced a bill in the
Legislature last week that would set up a state ``Superfund'' to
allow homeowners to collect repair money immediately.
   The state Department of Community Affairs is awaiting word from
consultants on its proposed regulations that the plywood be able to
withstand humidity of 100 percent and temperatures of at least 220
degrees, said department spokesman Jay Johnston.
   Homeowners of the units with the fire-resistant treated plywood
should not go up on the roof but instead check inside an attic for
signs of decay, experts say.
   Signs to look for are if the plywood's normal light creamy brown
color has darkened, if the plywood's smooth surface has turned
brittle and splintery or if a white powdery substance is building
up.
   The white powder is a leeching of the salts used to make the
plywood fire retardant. Heat on the roof as low as 150 degrees can
prompt the decay, Young said.
   Charles L'Hommedieu, the regional director for CNR Realty and
Management Co., a property concern in Teaneck, N.J., said his
company is continuing to investigate its projects for problems
which could arise as time passes.
   ``These roof systems are projected to start failing within six
years,'' he said.
   Young minimized the problem's effect on housing prices,
emphasizing instead the problems created by the plywood for real
estate agents.
   ``I wouldn't say it's significant in depressing prices,'' Young
said. ``It is a major concern for people who sell houses. By law
they're required to disclose it. That gets sort of messy for people
who just find out about it.''

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Surge on Bullish Supply Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures prices leaped Wednesday on the New York
Cotton Exchange after the government projected a smaller Florida
orange harvest than the market had expected.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures advanced, ending a
six-day price slide; livestock and meat futures were mixed; grains
and soybeans were mixed and precious metals were mixed.
   Prices for future deliveries of frozen concentrated orange juice
settled 1.95 cents to 4.85 cents higher in New York, with the
contract for delivery in May up 2.55 cents at $1.983 a pound.
   Analysts said the runup was prompted mainly by the Agriculture
Department's monthly orange crop report, which contained the same
harvest projections as in March _ 172 million 90-pound boxes,
including 103.1 million boxes from Florida. The report was released
Tuesday after the close of trading.
   Speculators were expecting an upward revision in the crop
projections and had sold orange juice futures aggressively in the
week prior to the report. The May contract had fallen a total of
7.45 cents in the five sessions ending Tuesday.
   Tuesday's Florida crop projection was about 30 percent below the
1988-89 Florida harvest of 146.6 million boxes, reflecting severe
damage caused by a freeze around Christmas.
   The tight-supply situation created by the freeze has resulted in
increased speculator activity and volatility in the orange juice
futures market.
   Sandra Kaul, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said
there are indications a large number of speculators still hold
short positions _ meaning contracts to deliver orange juice _ which
could lead to more strong rallies as those traders ``cover their
shorts'' by buying offsetting contracts.
   ``There should be massive covering at some point,'' Ms. Kaul
said. ``We see explosive rallies in the near future toward at least
$2.10 to $2.20.''
   Oil futures ended mostly higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after a day of wild price swings linked to supply concerns.
   Prices veered lower as trading opened, extending the steep
losses posted in the six previous sessions. But by late afternoon
the market had recovered the day's lost ground and had risen above
Tuesday's close.
   Analysts said the early move reflected the American Petroleum
Institute's report, released after the market closed Tuesday, that
U.S. crude oil inventories rose by a larger-than-expected 8.1
million barrels last week.
   But prices rebounded sharply later in the session after rumors
circulated that OPEC nations were consulting by telephone and
considering calling an emergency meeting to discuss the recent drop
in oil prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 29 cents lower to 38 cents
higher with May at $18.06 a barrel; heating oil was .60 cent to
1.23 cent higher with May at 53.63 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .55 cent to 1.20 cents higher with May at 59.58 cents
a gallon.
   Live cattle futures reached a record high of 80.40 cents a pound
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting record-high prices
paid for fed cattle in the Southern Plains.
   The previous high, posted in 1979, was 80.25 cents a pound.
   Pork futures rose sharply, with pork bellies surging the
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound after a weekly exchange
report showed lower-than-expected belly stocks.
   Live cattle finished .22 cent lower to .15 cent higher with
April at 80.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .30
cent lower with April at 83.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .30
cent to 1.20 cents higher with April at 56.02 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.15 cents to 2 cents higher with May at 57.80
cents a pound.
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans see-sawed to a mixed close
on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn futures turned in a
surprisingly weak performance in light of a shrinking national corn
stockpile.
   Traders had expected corn futures to rally after Tuesday's
monthly Agriculture Department supply-and-demand report, which
projected Sept. 1 corn stocks of 1.33 billion bushels, down from
March's estimate of 1.48 billion.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 2} cents higher with May at
$3.64} a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to \ cent higher with May
at $2.71\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to \ cent lower with May at
$1.51 a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with May
at $5.92} a bushel.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures ended 70 cents to
1.10 cents lower with April at $374.30 a troy ounce; silver was 3.4
cents to 3.8 cents higher with April at $5.129 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Credit Rating Agency Puts Time Warner Debt Under Watch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. is taking a closer look
at its ratings on about $7.1 billion in long-term public debt and
preferred stock of Time Warner Inc. because of the media and
entertainment giant's new financial agreement with Pathe
Communications Corp.
   Standard &amp; Poor's, one of the nation's leading credit rating
services, said it was placing $1.5 billion in Time Warner debt and
$5.6 billion of its preferred stock on its CreditWatch listing with
negative implications.
   The move is not an actual credit downgrade, which if undertaken
would increase Time Warner's borrowing costs.
   The action, announced Tuesday, followed Time Warner's
announcement that it had agreed to help arrange $650 million of the
$1.2 billion that Pathe would need to complete its acquistion of
MGM-UA Communications Co.
   S&amp;P said in its statement that the arrangement amounted to a
guarantee that ``is expected to increase Time Warner's already
substantial financial risk.''
   Time Warner took on about $10.6 billion in debt last year when
the former Time Inc. acquired Warner Communications Inc.
   The ratings agency said ``Time Warner's own bank agreement calls
for sizable repayments in March 1992 (extendable to March 1993)
which will require refinancing in a now more difficult environment
for financing highly leveraged deals.''
   In exchange for the financing, Time Warner would obtain the
right to acquire warrants that would amount to a 20 percent stake
in the combined Pathe-MGM-UA company at some point. Time Warner's
Warner Bros. studio also reportedly would enter into a ``support
services'' agreement under which it would handle Pathe and MGM-UA
releases for distribution in theaters, on television and on
videocassettes.
   In its own statement, Time Warner said, ``We believe strongly in
the long-term worldwide benefits of our agreement, both to Warner
Bros. and to Pathe.''
   It said the value of the UA library, which is being pledged as
security for the financing, ``significantly exceeds the $650
million provided in this deal.''
   Even as it placed Time Warner on CreditWatch, S&amp;P said the
agency ``continues to view Time Warner's business positions,
cash-generating capacity and asset values favorably despite the
company's aggressive profile.''

<HEAD>Analysts Say McGowan's Hospitalization Won't Hurt MCI</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industry analysts said Wednesday that MCI
Communications Corp. won't be hurt by the hospitalization of the
phone company's founder and chairman, William G. McGowan.
   McGowan, who had a heart transplant three years ago, underwent
exploratory chest surgery Tuesday at Presbyterian-University
Hospital in Pittsburgh. He was listed in fair condition Wednesday.
   Doctors decided last week to operate after ``they discovered a
condition'' during a routine checkup, said MCI spokeswoman Kathleen
Keegan. She would not say what the condition was. His doctor,
Bartley Griffith, said the surgery was unrelated to the heart
transplant but would not elaborate.
   McGowan, 62, was expected to be hospitalized for five to seven
days.
   Charles Nichols, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said McGowan is not in charge of day-to-day operations at
MCI, so his hospitalization should not be a blow to the company.
   Nichols said MCI, based in Washington, D.C., is run on a daily
basis by its president and chief operating officer, Bert C. Roberts
Jr., and its chief financial officer, Daniel F. Akerson.
   ``I think MCI is a very well-run company with a very strong
management team,'' added Charles Schelke, an analyst at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``As important as McGowan has been, it's
certainly more than a one-man company.''
   Interest in McGowan's surgery was heightened by MCI's announced
deal to acquire Telecom USA Inc., the nation's fourth-largest
long-distance company. MCI, the No. 2 long-distance phone company
after American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., announced the $1.25
billion acquisition on Monday.
   The company's disclosure of McGowan's hospitalization came a day
later.
   MCI officials knew Monday that the chairman was scheduled to
enter the hospital that night, but decided to delay an announcement
until more was known about his condition, Ms. Keegan said.
   ``As soon as we knew how the surgery had gone we announced,''
she said.
   She said McGowan presided over an MCI board of directors meeting
Sunday night, conducted by telephone conference call, at which the
board approved the Telecom deal.

<TEXT>
   To justify seizing Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association, regulators arbitrarily wrote down the value of its
$1.4 billion loan portfolio by 50 percent and slashed the worth of
its extensive land, hotel and stock holdings by 75 percent, the
thrift's former owner said Wednesday.
   ``Without any analysis, they took the entire loan portfolio and
said it was non-performing,'' Phoenix financier Charles H. Keating
Jr. testified in his fifth day on the witness stand in his suit
seeking to recover the Irvine, Calif., S&amp;L.
   Reading from a Federal Home Loan Bank Board analysis of
Lincoln's loan and equity portfolios prepared a week after the
government imposed a conservatorship April 14, 1989, Keating called
the numbers ``absurd.''
   The analysis, in the form of an April 21, 1989 memo from
regulators in charge of the Lincoln case to bank board officials in
Washington, is the first government document specifying regulators'
estimate that alleged losses of federally insured deposits by the
thrift could cost taxpayers $2 billion.
   The document estimated that the thrift's assets were worth only
$2 billion to $2.5 billion, or $1.85 billion to $2.2 billion less
than what they were listed as on Lincoln's books at the time.
   For nearly a year, Keating has asserted that he ran Lincoln
soundly and that regulators could show that the thrift was
insolvent only by placing a lower value on its assets.
   Comparing the figures from the regulators' analysis with those
provided by American Continental's chief financial officer, he
testified Wednesday that only 3 percent of Lincoln's $1.4 billion
mortage loan portfolio was more than 60 days in default.
   All of the loans, Keating testifed, were fully secured with the
borrowers putting up an average 20 percent down payment on the
property.
   The regulators, however, listed the value of those loans at only
$703 million, accounting for a third of the losses they claim that
Lincoln suffered.
   Robert Wurzelbacher, Keating's son-in-law who headed Lincoln's
real estate investments, likened the analysis to a family buying a
$100,000 home with a $20,000 down payment and an $80,000 loan.
   Then a regulator comes in and says the value of the home and the
loan on it is worth only $40,000, even though the monthly payments
are still being made, he said.
   James Murphy, an attorney representing the Treasury Department's
Office of Thrift Supervision, repeatedly objected to Keating
comparing the numbers from the regulators' April 21 analysis and
Keating's own figures on the status of Lincoln's loans and equity
holdings as of Dec. 31, 1988.
   ``This is not by any stretch of the imagination the last word on
the implementation of the receivership'' four months later, Murphy
said.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision succeeded the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board as the industry's chief regulator under the $50 billion
savings and loan bailout passed last year by Congress.
   The government seized control of Lincoln in April last year
under the conservatorship, claiming that it was being grossly
mismanaged but making no assertion at the time that it was
insolvent.
   It wasn't until August that the regulators asserted that
Lincoln's alleged losses actually exceeded the value of its assets
and imposed a receivership that took ownership of the thrift from
Keating.
   U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin overruled Murphy's
objections, but said he wanted testimony from Keating's chief
financial officer in addition to hearing from regulators on their
justifications for the writedowns.
   ``You don't write down 50 percent on a mortgage portfolio,''
said Sporkin, who is a former accountant and was at one time the
chief enforcement officer for the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Keating's attorneys also introduced documents showing that
regulators were unhappy with the performance of the consultant they
hired at an annual salary of $300,000 to run Lincoln after seizing
control from Keating.
   In a July 19, 1989, memo to the bank board's top officials in
Washington, Mark Randall, the government official in charge of
managing the conservatorship, said the consultant, Roger Clark,
failed to address Lincoln's major problems.
   ``Roger Clark's inaction, questionable judgment and lack of
participation establish his inability to function as a CEO (chief
executive officer) of Lincoln,'' Randall's memo read.
   Keating said that Clark is still holds titles as both the CEO
and chief financial officer of Lincoln under a contract that
requires the government to pay him a $100,000 termination fee but
that other officials are actually running the thrift under the
receivership.

<HEAD>U.S. Alcohol Consumption Expected To Decline Further; Beer Again
No. 1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beer was by far the nation's most popular
alcoholic beverage last year, with Americans consuming nearly 34
gallons per capita, an industry publication reported Wednesday.
   The industry publication Market Watch, using computer-driven
figures to make its estimates, also forecast that by the year 2000
consumption would be lower for virtually all types of wine, spirits
and beer.
   Americans age 21 or older drank an estimated 33.79 gallons per
capita of beers in 1989, a figure Market Watch expects will drop by
about 4.5 gallons in the next 10 years. Consumption was 34.1
gallons in 1988, according to other industry estimates.
   Wine consumption is expected to drop from 2.54 gallons per
capita in 1989 to 2.12 gallons. Consumption was 3.23 gallons per
capita in 1988.
   Distilled spirits will dip most sharply from 2.15 gallons to
1.63 gallons. Spirits consumption was 2.2 gallons per capita in
1988.
   Like other industry observers and economists, the publication
blamed the effects of health warning labels and anti-alcohol
lobbyists as major factors in the general decline of beverage
alcohol.
   The industry also is expected to be affected by added state and
federal taxes come on. Many states reportedly are considering added
alcohol taxes.
   In California, voters in November will decide whether to raise
the tax on wine from one cent a gallon to $1.29 a gallon; on beer,
from 4 cents a gallon to 57.3 cents a gallon; and on distilled
spirits, from $2 a gallon to $8.40 a gallon.
   Per capita consumption of wine, in terms of gallons per person
21 years and over, is currently 2.54 gallons. The leader is table
wine (still wine not over 14 percent alcohol), 1.96 gallons,
followed by dessert wine (port, sherry) 0.19 gallons; champagnes,
0.23 gallons; and special natural (two or more different fruit
products), 0.13 gallons.
   For distilled spirits, per capita consumption is 2.15 gallons,
led by whiskey, 0.81 gallons; bourbon, 0.23; blends, 0.14; Scotch,
0.17; Canadian, 0.26; Irish, 0.01; gin, 0.19; vodka, 0.53; rum,
0.18, and tequila, 0.07.
   In the specialty category, per capita consumption is 0.38
gallons, led by cordials and liqueurs, 0.25 gallons; brandy 0.11
gallons, and cocktails and mixed drinks, 0.02 gallons.
   Domestic beers account for 32.24 gallons per capita, and
imported 1.55 gallons.

<HEAD>Time Warner, Viacom Reportedly Discussing Merging Comedy Cable
Networks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc. are discussing
merging their fledgling comedy cable networks, The Comedy Channel
and Ha!, sources at both companies said Wednesday.
   The companies had previously discussed but failed to agree on
merging their comedy networks, according to one of the sources, who
spoke on condition they not be identified.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that executives and
attorneys from both companies said Time Warner and Viacom are
discussing a 50-50 joint venture in a single comedy channel, or a
venture that would include equity investments by a group of cable
operators.
   A spokesman for Time Warner said the company had no comment on
the report. A spokeswoman for Viacom read a statement from Viacom
Chairman Sumner Redstone which said, ``Under all the circumstances
that exist in this situation, we prefer not to comment in the
media.''
   Both companies are believed to be facing trouble lining up cable
TV systems that will give them a space on the channel selector.
   Many cable systems have already filled their available channel
space and are reluctant to drop current networks in favor of new
ones.
   Time Warner launched The Comedy Channel last November and says
that it has 6 million subscribers. Viacom started its Ha! cable
network on April 1.
   Industry analysts say it generally takes 25 million to 30
million subscribers for a cable network to break even.
   The two networks follow different programming formats, with The
Comedy Channel relying on original programs and snippets from
comedy series and movies while Ha! features reruns of sitcoms and
programs such as ``Saturday Night Live.''
   Time Warner and Viacom are embroiled in a lawsuit in which
Viacom's Showtime Networks is asking for $2.5 billion in damages
against Time Warner's Home Box Office. Showtime contends that HBO
monopolizes the pay-television business in violation of antitrust
laws.

<TEXT>
   Ames Department Stores Inc., the
troubled retailer that announced plans earlier this week to close
74 stores, said Wednesday it was cutting 200 jobs in its corporate
headquarters.
   The company said in a brief announcement that 50 employees will
be laid off and another 150 vacant jobs will not be filled. The
cuts will leave 1,650 workers at the company's Hartford-area
headquarters.
   In January, the company eliminated 325 jobs at its headquarters,
85 through layoffs and 240 by not filling vacancies.
   The retailer has stumbled repeatedly since its 1988 purchase of
nearly 400 Zayre stores. With the purchase, Ames doubled in size
and instantly transformed itself from a little-known, New
England-based chain into the nation's fourth-largest discounter.
Only K mart Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the Target division of
Dayton Hudson Corp. are bigger.
   The company, which operates 690 stores, announced Monday that it
would report a loss of $228 million for the year ended Jan. 27.
Ames also said Monday it was negotiating with its banks for a new
credit agreement.
   Ames stock stabilized Wednesday after dropping steadily
beginning last Thursday, when the retailer announced that its sales
in March were down 12 percent.
   The stock, which was trading at $9 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange in early January, closed at $4.37{ last Thursday and
dropped even further, to $2.37{, after a day of heavy trading
Tuesday.
   In more heavy trading Wednesday, Ames stock closed at $2.50, up
12{ cents.
   In late 1987, Ames shares were worth nearly $30 each.
   Ames has attributed its troubles to the sluggish retail market
in the Northeast and to problems with the former Zayre stores. The
company has been unable to revitalize the stores by renaming them
and has even lost some Zayre customers by changing that chain's
advertising and pricing policies.
   The Zayre stores had been known for frequent promotions, heavy
advertising and discounted fashion items. Ames, in contrast, stocks
more traditional merchandise and runs fewer promotions.
   ``Ames management is learning that it is very difficult to wean
the customer from a promotional vendor,'' said L. Wayne Hood, a
retailing analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Further, the company's attempts to quickly merge Ames and Zayre
computer systems resulted in some glitches that delayed payments to
suppliers, which led some suppliers to cut off the chain's credit.
   Ames bought the 392-store Zayre chain on Oct. 28, 1988, for $800
million, doubling its size. It has since closed some of those
stores and converted others to the Ames name.
   The 74 stores to be closed are primarily former Zayre stores in
Florida, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, said Douglas W. Ewing, Ames
director of investor relations.
   Ames announced in December 1989 that it was closing 18 stores,
mostly in the Northeast.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong Easter holiday weekend could boost
Greyhound Lines Inc. to the financial break-even point as it
attempts to rebuild from a lengthy bus drivers strike, says
President Frank Schmieder.
   The five-day Easter travel period ending Monday is one of the
five busiest times of the year for Greyhound.
   Schmieder said in an interview this week that the company
projects revenue in the next few days will be between 70 percent
and 73 percent of revenue at the same time last year.
   ``Seventy-three percent of revenue is cash break even, and when
we do that, we figure we've turned the corner,'' said Schmieder.
   Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions, called Greyhound's latest claims
``preposterous.''
   ``They've been claiming the turned corners for the last six
weeks,'' said Nelson.
   The company's 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 of its office and
maintenance workers walked out March 2 in an argument over wages
and job security. Greyhound has been operating a reduced schedule
since, using permanent replacements and drivers willing to cross
picket lines.
   Negotiations have been stalled since last month. The company has
refused to bargain until seven days have passed without major
violence against its buses, which have been hit by gunfire and
suffered other attacks.
   The company also filed a $30 million federal lawsuit earlier
this week charging the union was behind the violence. The union
claims the company is using the violence as an excuse to avoid
negotiations.
   Greyhound has increased service in stages, with the latest
addition scheduled for Thursday when the company plans to add
almost 100,000 miles, putting it at 458,595 miles, or 71.8 percent
of pre-strike levels.
   Schmieder said on March 28 that the strike was ``essentially
over'' in much of the country, as the company continued expanding
to cover more of its pre-strike routes.
   Union officials claim Greyhound actually is operating only about
20 percent of its pre-strike routes.
   Through Easter, Greyhound is offering free tickets if its buses
are late in the busy Northeast, where strike service has been
hardest hit.
   Schmieder said the promotion has been effective, with about 800
passengers, or 1.4 percent of the total, getting free tickets in
the first five days of the offer. Business in the region has risen
to about 12,000 passengers a day from around 8,000.
   Passenger volumes nationwide totaled more than more than 56
percent of the volume for the same day last year, according to
company figures.
   P. Anthony Lannie, Greyhound's executive vice president, said
the company should be serving 95 percent of its routes by summer,
although cutbacks are possible when the slower fall season arrives.
   Lannie said Greyhound will have 3,200 drivers by May 1, but will
need at least 1,000 more to meet summer demand.
   While passenger traffic may be growing, the company is missing
out on money from its small package express business, which
accounted for about $92 million of Greyhound's $1.04 billion in
revenue last year.
   Schmieder said the package business is at about 45 percent of
year-earlier levels, although he expects the increased service to
raise that to 50 percent.
   Greyhound's charter operation, which last year brought in $90
million, has been almost non-existent during the strike as the
company has used drivers for its mainline operations.
   Greyhound Lines was created three years ago in a debt-financed
buyout of the bus operations of Greyhound Corp. Later that year,
Greyhound Lines also bought the Dallas-based operator of the
largest Trailways bus system.
   Despite its reduced cash flow, Greyhound has continued to pay
its bills, Schmieder says. The next interest payment is due May 15,
``and if we had to make the payment today, we could do it.''

   Raytheon Inc. said gains in its defense

   ``Raytheon continues to grow on the strength of its diverse

   Earnings in the period rose to $130.9 million, or $2 a share,

1989. Sales rose to $2.225 billion from $2.07 billion.
   ``During the first quarter, our electronics segment _ led by
government electronics _ performed well, the aircraft and energy
services segment continued a rapid profit growth, and all five
business segments remained profitable,'' he said.
   Raytheon said its order backlog rose to $9.49 billion at the end
of the first quarter, including $6.84 billion in government orders,
from $8.88 billion a year earlier, including $6.78 billion from the
government.
   In addition to making missiles and other defense electronics,
Raytheon's operations include Beech Aircraft and Amana appliances.

<HEAD>District Court Rejects Norton Bid To Postpone Shareholders Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday delivered a blow to
Norton Co. by rejecting the company's attempt to postpone a key
shareholders meeting to buy more time to thwart a hostile takeover
bid by a British company.
   U.S. District Court Judge Joseph L. Tauro ordered Norton's board
to restore the annual shareholders meeting to its original date of
April 26.
   The company's directors had canceled that meeting and
rescheduled it for June 26, in an effort to give themselves more
time to fight a $1.6 billion, $75-a-share offer from BTR PLC, a
British conglomerate.
   Norton, a maker of grinding tools and sandpaper, has rejected
the offer as ``inadequate.''
   The company moved to postpone the shareholder meeting on March
29 after BTR executives said they were considering waging a proxy
fight to unseat Norton's board at the meeting.
   A spokesman for Norton said the company planned to appeal the
ruling in the U.S. District Court of Appeals.
   ``If the Appeals Court allows BTR to compel Norton to hold the
April 26 meeting, Norton shareholders will be forced to make an
irrevocable decision as to the future of Norton before the Norton
Board has had a reasonable opportunity to explore alternatives to
the BTR offer,'' John M. Nelson, chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a statement.
   BTR welcomed the ruling in a statement, saying it would give
shareholders ``a timely opportunity'' to press management to remove
obstacles to the offer.
   BTR's bid has aroused protests by Norton workers and local
officials who fear the Worcester company would be dismantled. BTR
officials have disputed those claims.

<HEAD>Justice Department Joins Suit Claiming Overcharges on Jet Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government joined a former
Northrop Corp. employee Wednesday in suing the defense contractor
for allegedly over-billing the Navy by millions of dollars on parts
for the FA-18 fighter-bomber.
   Northrop was accused of developing in 1985 an improved, cheaper
way of producing composite fuselage parts for the plane without
passing on the savings to the Navy or telling the Pentagon about
the improvement.
   The civil suit, one of several accusing Northrop of over-billing
or improper testing, was filed by former employee Eldon Janssen
under a federal act that allows people to sue government suppliers
for alleged fraud.
   Details of the action were unsealed after the government
intervened Wednesday.
   ``The government has not yet determined the exact amount of the
damages,'' the Justice Department said in a statement. ``Estimates,
however, range into the millions of dollars.''
   Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio declined to comment because
officials had not seen the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit is one in a series of legal actions against Northrop.
   Last month, the Justice Department sued Northrop for more than
$5 million in civil damages after the company pleaded guilty in a
criminal case to lying about performing all required tests on parts
for the Marine Corps' AV-8B Harrier jet.
   The company agreed to pay a $17 million fine in a criminal case
concerning the Harrier.
   Northrop also has been accused of making political payoffs to
South Koreans and overcharging the Air Force by $20 billion on the
B-2 stealth bomber.
   The B-2 suit, like the action over the FA-18, was a so-called
``whistle blower'' case filed by former employees.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor and Two Employees Face Sentencing on Federal

   A defense contractor and two employees face
sentencing in federal court after pleading guilty to charges of
failing to test bolts for use in combat aircraft, including the
F-16 fighter and the B-1B bomber.
   Norman McHaffie and the workers at his Sylmar company, McHaffie
Inc., also pleaded guilty to submitting fraudulent certificates to
the military that the bolts had been tested and met all
specifications.
   McHaffie, James Hick and William Whitman entered the pleas
Monday, and sentencing was set for June 18, said U.S. attorney
spokeswoman Grace Denton.
   If convicted, McHaffie's company could face a maximum of $1.5
million in fines. McHaffie, 56, could be sentenced to 15 years in
prison and $750,000.
   Hicks, 45, and Whitham, 37, cooperated with the government in
the case, prosecutors said. Each faces a possible maximum sentence
of 10 years in prison and $500,000 fines.
   The charges of conspiracy and false statements stem from
practices over an eight-year-period, authorities say.
   McHaffie was accused of telling Hicks, his quality control
supervisor, and Whitman, his production shop floor manager, to
create fake test data and fabricate reports to conceal the fraud,
the government's complaint alleged.
   ``Later, after the government became aware of the scheme,
McHaffie and Hicks decided to destroy the falsified documents to
conceal the scope of the fraud from government auditors,'' said a
statement from the U.S. attorney's office.
