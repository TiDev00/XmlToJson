   A fuel slick in the Allegheny River slid
past Pittsburgh without entering the city's intake valves, and the
fast-moving oil posed little threat Tuesday of fouling water
downstream, officials said.
   Nine oil booms were removed from the Allegheny near Freeport on
Tuesday, said EPA spokeswoman Carrie Deitzel. Another 16 booms will
remain in the river.
   ``The situation is good and it's the best it's been,'' said Carl
Kuehn, deputy director of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management
Agency.
   Federal, state and local officials began formal investigations
of the spill, which began late Friday 35 miles north of Pittsburgh
when at least 76,000 gallons of diesel, gasoline and kerosene
spilled from a ruptured underground pipeline owned by the Buckeye
Pipe Line Co.
   Buckeye said the ruptured pipeline was triggered by a landslide,
but Charles Duritsa, regional director of the state Department of
Environmental Resources, said residents near the spill site smelled
fuel a day before the landslide.
   There was speculation the leaking fuel weakened the ground and
caused the slide, he said.
   Officials on Tuesday criticized the National Transportation
Safety Board, which issues permits and regulates the nation's
pipeline system, for not becoming involved in the cleanup and
investigation.
   ``We feel there is a need for further investigation. We would
like to see more in-depth action'' by the NTSB, Kuehn said. ``We
are not happy with the response at this time.''
   Communities downstream from the spill were forced to close the
intake valves into their water treatment plants as the muck slowly
moved downstream. The spill at one time had threatened the water
supplies of up to 1 million people along the Allegheny and Ohio
rivers.
   Officials said small globs of the mixture from fuel-soaked soil
will continue to seep into the Allegheny at the ruptured pipeline
near Freeport. The amounts appear to be insignificant, but will be
monitored continually, said Dave Wright of the Environmental
Protection Agency.

<HEAD>Japanese Pay Auction Record for A Chagall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unidentified Japanese bidding by telephone paid
an auction record price of $6.09 million for a work by artist Marc
Chagall.
   The 1949 painting by the Russian-born artist, ``The Bride under
the Canopy,'' was the highest-priced work in Tuesday night's sale
at Sothebys of impressionist and modern art.
   Chagall painted ``The Bride Under the Canopy'' after he returned
to France from the United States.
   It shows a bride and groom under an awning, with a large vase of
leaves and flowers and a violinist, one of Chagall's ``lucky
charms.''
   Another Chagall of a vase of flowers with Russian people and
motifs around the edges, ``The Farmers' Bouquet,'' went for $5.02
million. The buyer also was a Japanese telephone bidder.
   Sotheby's did not say if the two Chagalls went to the same buyer.
   Anonymous Japanese also paid $3.5 million for a 1933 work by
Paul Klee, ``Arrival of the Bridegroom,'' and the same price for a
Pablo Picasso 1904 blue portrait of the Catalan poet Jaime Sabartes.
   Sabartes became Picasso's secretary, and he wrote a biography of
the artist in 1946. He also collaborated with Wilhelm Boeck on a
comprehensive study of Picasso's art published in New York in 1955.

<HEAD>Sony Apologizes for Using Dec. 7 as Example in its Manual</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Berlin Wall, the Warsaw Pact and
other legacies of World War II are fading fast, but some things
live in infamy, as Sony Corp. of America was recently reminded.
   The Japanese electronics company acknowledged Monday that it
apologized to a customer for using Dec. 7 _ the date of Japan's
attack on Pearl Harbor _ as an example in an owners manual
explaining how to set the date on its videocassette recorders.
   Sony's apology came in response to a complaint by Scott L.
Edelheit, a Boca Raton, Fla., man who said his father was killed at
Pearl Harbor in 1941.
   The date was inadvertently used in the Japanese-printed manual
for a VCR Edelheit had bought, said Jason Farrow, a spokesman at
Sony's U.S. headquarters in Park Ridge.
   ``We try to be sensitive on these issues,'' he said. ``It would
be irrational for anyone to think that a company that does 25
percent of its business in the United States would ever
intentionally do anything like that.''
   Farrow said Sony had not determined whether the mistake occurred
at its Tokyo office or whether the date was changed by the printer.
   Ken Iwaki, Sony deputy president in Tokyo, told Edelheit in his
letter that the company ``has told the concerned people in Tokyo to
be more careful and not to let this happen again.''
   Edelheit has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached
for comment.

<HEAD>Test Cheating in India Widens; ETS Cancels 6,600 Scores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evidence of test buying and other cheating has
led the Educational Testing Service to cancel the scores of some
6,600 students in India who took the Graduate Record Examination
between October and February.
   In the wake of what is almost certainly the worst case in
history of cheating on standardized tests, ETS said Monday it will
offer the exams less often and at fewer locations in India.
   A five-month investigation found security breaches at many test
centers and evidence students had been able to buy copies of the
exam in advance.
   The problems came to light in December when the Princeton,
N.J.-based test service said it was wiping out the scores of 2,744
Indian students who took the GRE in October. The test is for
admission to graduate school.
   ETS spokesman Ray Nicosia said at that time that the test
service had received dozens of letters from Indian students and
test center supervisors indicating that students had been able to
buy copies of the test beforehand.
   The test, administered to some 366,000 students worldwide each
year, is taken by 14,000 Indian students.
   The cheating continued despite the investigation, said Charlotte
Kuh, ETS executive director of GRE programs.
   She said the service canceled the scores of students who took
the GRE on Jan. 20, Feb. 3 and Feb. 10, bringing the number of
cancellations to about 6,600.
   ``The problem was somewhere in our shipping process,'' said Kuh.
She would not say who the culprits were.
   ``We are certain that the majority of students in India did not
have pre-knowledge of the test questions,'' said Kuh.
``Nonetheless, because it is ETS's responsibility to provide valid
test scores, ETS must cancel all scores in group security cases
when it is impossible to determine which scores are valid and which
are not.''

<TEXT>
   A spat between Mexico and Panama over whose
government has the most _ or least _ legitimacy is heating up with
officials and newspapers trading insults and demanding
``explanations.''
   Mexico's official government newspaper, El Nacional, used words
like ``bluster,'' ``swagger'' and ``stupid'' on Monday to describe
President Guillermo Endara of Panama.
   Newspapers in Panama, meanwhile, said Mexico's ``party
dictatorship'' had been a model for Panama's bygone military
regimes.
   The war of words began Friday after the Rio Group of nations _
Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay, Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil and Peru _
called for elections in Panama to ``legitimize'' its post-invasion
government.
   The Rio Group's statement, issued in Mexico City, angered
Endara, who was sworn in during the U.S. invasion in December.
Mexico, Peru and Argentina have refused to send ambassadors to
Endara's government.
   Endara shot back Saturday, saying Mexico's government took power
through election fraud and Panama doesn't need its endorsement.
   He said his own government was ``legitimized by the people at
the polls on May 7. We don't want the legitimization of the Mexican
government ... because it is a government that came to power
through sheer electoral fraud.''
   International observers say Endara's ticket overwhelmingly won
the May 7 Panamanian election, which strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega later voided.
   Mexico's Foreign Ministry responded dryly to Endara's attack
with a statement saying it ``will proceed, through diplomatic
means, to ask for an explanation.''
   Election fraud is an extremely touchy subject in Mexico, where
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has been in power
for 61 years.
   Unlike Panama or Nicaragua, Mexico does not allow international
election observers. The results of its 1988 presidential election
are still clouded by accusations that the PRI resorted to electoral
fraud to stay in power.
   The PRI on Monday demanded an apology from Endara. It also
accused him of presiding over the ``persecution, torture, jailing
and execution of thousands of Panamanians.''
   The party did not elaborate, but it appeared to be making a
reference to the U.S. invasion, when hundreds of members of
Noriega's defense forces were arrested. There have been no reports
of torture or execution.
   ``The Panamanian regime must offer an apology and give clear and
satisfactory explanations for the serious breach it has
committed,'' the party said in a statement.
   In Monday's editorial, El Nacional said: ``The swaggering tone,
the superficial and stupid reaction of Endara show what kind of
person has been put in charge of governing Panama.
   ``His bluster derives from the circumstances in which he became
president: sworn in at a barracks of the power invading his
country, backed by a foreign power.''
   In Panama, Foreign Minister Julio Linares said Mexico seems to
have been more comfortable with Noriega's dictatorship than the new
civilian government. The U.S. invasion ousted Noriega from power.
   ``Mexico has made more trouble for Endara in three months that
it did in 21 years of military dictatorship,'' he told reporters.
   The Panama City daily El Editorial said Panama's military
regimes had used the PRI as a model, while La Prensa suggested
Mexico reform its ``party dictatorship.''

<HEAD>Former Underground Publication Becomes Independent Daily</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia's best-read
underground newspaper has published its first issue as a
full-fledged daily, and pledges to stay independent.
   Despite police harassment, Lidove Noviny (People's News) had
circulated monthly in hundreds of self-published copies since
December 1987.
   It carried frequent contributions from such notable former
dissidents as Vaclav Havel, now President Havel, and Jiri
Dienstbier, now foreign minister.
   During its underground existence, the paper was granted
exclusive interviews by late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov,
President Bush and other well-known political figures, angering the
former Communist authorities.
   Lidove's editor, Jiri Ruml, was the last of Czechoslovakia's
leading dissidents to be released from prison, only nine days after
the country's peaceful revolution began Nov. 17.
   In its first issues this year, the paper printed criticism of
the Communist Party as well as the country's strongest opposition
force, Civic Forum, enhancing its image as the voice of
free-thinking people.
   Monday's first daily issue, consisting of eight pages and a
press run of 250,000 copies, carried a melange of news, comment and
opinion, including articles about Lithuania independence drive and
German reunification plans.
   Political and commercial independence is a tenet of the paper.
   ``There were offers from press tycoons like Robert Maxwell and
Rupert Murdoch to buy stock in our paper, but we rejected them,''
Ruml told a news conference last month. ``We are not going to
accept any capital from anyone.''
   The commercial side of the Lidove Noviny publishing project is
supported by a line of some 30 publications, including two books by
Havel and a large number of previously unpublished works by other
dissidents.
   Looking back at 40 years of censorship by Communist authorities,
Ruml made it clear he wanted his paper to be different.
   ``One of the main priorities is to revive the good language in
which newspapers should be written, not that (Communist) journalese
gibberish we have been reading so far,'' he said.

<HEAD>Digital Audio Tape Finally Reaching Consumers; Will Cassette Go
Way of LP?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Digital audio tape recording _ the home taping
enthusiast's dream and the music industry's worst nightmare _
finally is here.
   With a protracted legal battle over this latest advance in
high-end recording potentially resolved, manufacturers are
promising to roll out their consumer DAT machines by summer, nearly
three years later than first expected.
   The recording industry, aware of statistics showing that four
out of 10 people over the age of 10 have taped recorded music in
the past year, is holding its breath. In DAT, the big guns in the
hardware industry are unleashing a product that threatens to do to
the humble audiocassette what tapes and fancy compact discs did to
the once-mighty vinyl LP.
   ``It has the potential of doing what CD did in its initial
introduction into the marketplace'' _ or about 35,000 units in the
first year, said Paul Foschino, assistant general manager of
Technics, the Secaucus, N.J.-based arm of Japan's Matushita
Electric Corp.
   Matushita plans to introduce a DAT recorder in the United States
under the Technics label this summer at a cost of about $1,200 to
$1,300, Foschino said. The machines will carry a Panasonic label in
Europe and Japan.
   Philips Consumer Electronics plans to introduce a DAT machine
this year, and it also is developing a cassette that could be
played on both digital equipment and the analog cassette machines
already in use, according to the trade publication Audio Week.
   How well the pricey DAT machines fare with consumers is an open
question, but some analysts predict that, like CD players, the
prices will come down sharply when the new format gains popularity.
   A disturbing blip on the horizon for DAT manufacturers, however,
is the prospect of recordable-erasable CDs, which Tandy Corp., for
one, is developing.
   The imminent arrival of these digital technologies has revived
the debate over home taping and whether artists should be
reimbursed for potential lost sales. The money most likely would
come from royalty fees on blank tapes or recorders.
   A recent study by the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment said home taping may be causing as much as a 22 percent
loss in prerecorded music sales. OTA said its survey in fall 1988
showed 41 percent of people over age 10 had taped recorded music in
the previous year.
   Songwriters, composers and music publishers claim that with DAT
they'll lose even more royalties as listeners make virtually
perfect tape copies of their favorite compact discs.
   But a bill pending in Congress to limit the number of copies
that DAT machines can make has eased concerns of record
manufacturers and cleared the way for introduction of the machines.
The bill codifies an agreement reached last summer in Athens
between the recording and manufacturing industries.
   Although the bill by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., does not
address the royalties question, the record industry considers the
measure to be a major step forward.
   David Leibowitz, senior vice president-general counsel of the
Recording Industry Association of America, says the group remains
``very committed to royalties.''
   ``However, we don't believe that royalties are politically
achievable at the present time, which is why we felt that we should
at least secure some protection,'' he said.
   But the artists who create the songs aren't satisfied. They
question whether or not the new anti-copying technology is
tamper-proof and say that even limited copying cuts into their
business and will lead, ultimately, to fewer recordings being made.
   ``We want the technology to move forward, but the question is
will it allow us to make a living and will consumers have product
available,'' said Ed Murphy, president of the National Music
Publishers Association.
   Opponents of fees on blank DAT tapes or recorders claim such a
royalty system would be unfair to those who don't use the tapes to
record music.
   ``If you want to tape your child's first words, why should you
pay Michael Jackson for that?'' said Ed Baxter, chief counsel to
the Senate Judiciary patents, copyrights and trademarks
subcommittee.
   It is still uncertain how the DAT bill will fare this year in
the House in a session shortened by election-year politicking and a
major clean air bill that is tying up the Energy and Commerce
Committee, where the bill resides.
   ``I don't think it's a terribly controversial issue, but it's
just a question of whether there's enough time,'' said one
congressional aide who would not allow his name to be used.
   To the recording industry, the scary part about DAT, which uses
the 1s and 0s of computer language to make exact duplicates of the
source material, is that as many as 20 generations of digital
copies can be made without discernible loss of quality.
   Faced with the threat of runaway home copying, which copyright
law generally has declared to be legal ``personal use,'' the RIAA
in 1987 threatened to sue any manufacturer that introduced a
consumer DAT model before copyright issues could be addressed.
   The Athens agreement settled the legal question _ for now _ by
instituting the Serial Copy Management System. SCMS will allow one
DAT copy to be made from a copyrighted CD, but the user cannot make
a copy from the DAT copy. It would allow a CD to be copied
indefinitely onto different blank DAT tapes.
   The system also limits to two the number of generations of
copies that can be made from a non-digital source, such as today's
``analog'' audiocassettes, LPs or radio broadcasts. One copy of a
copy could be made from analog sources.
   SCMS uses a silicon chip that will be able to detect an
electronic anti-piracy ``flag'' that is placed on a copyrighted
digital material such as music CDs. The chip will ``write'' this
flag onto the first DAT copy made from the CD. If a DAT recorder
detects this flag, its record function will not operate.
   Professional DAT machines, without SCMS, already are in use in
the United States in the recording, broadcast and computer
industries _ at hefty prices ranging from $2,500 to $7,000. ``Gray
market'' consumer models can be had for $1,600 to $3,000.
Automobile DAT players have been available for more than a year at
$1,500 and up, with some prerecorded DAT tapes _ mostly classical
and jazz _ available at about $25.
   DAT tapes, which are about half the size of conventional
audiocassettes, can store as much as two encyclopedia's worth of
data, much more than conventional cartridges used for backup
computer storage. DAT tapes could be useful as backups to hard
discs on personal computers.
   DAT machines work something like a typical videocassette
recorder. A mechanism inside the DAT machine opens a door on the
back of the DAT cassette and draws the 1@3-inch-wide tape around a
spinning record-play drum. The recording is accomplished at the
dizzying speed of 123 inches per second _ 65 times faster than
today's audiocassette deck.

   The standard photograph of Soviet
founder Vladimir I. Lenin found in the office of every factory
manager has vanished, leaving a telltale patch on the wall over the
desk of Vincas Babilius.
   ``I had all the books, too,'' Babilius said, pointing to bare
shelves that once held the works of Lenin and Karl Marx. But since
Lithuania declared independence on March 11, Babilius no longer
feels compelled to follow the Soviet model to run the Vilnius
Electrical Measuring Device factory.
   While Lithuania's political leaders struggle daily with Moscow's
effort to make them renounce the declaration of independence,
people all over the small Baltic nation are quietly moving to
establish a state, run on its own principles.
   They have an enormous task. Lithuania's telephone and
connections to the outside world go through Moscow. Its sole direct
route to Poland and the outside world is a tiny back road so
overused that passing through frontier formalities can require
days. It is caught in a web of connections to the Soviet economy,
which is rapidly careenng downhill.
   Babilius knows it will take years to untangle the mess left by
50 years of communism.
   But he has begun. Already, he has banned the political meetings
that consumed staff time and helped ensure communist grip on power.
   ``At work, you have to work,'' he said simply.
   On the Lithuanian-Byelorussian border, the new government so far
has been unable to station frontier guards because of the angry
reaction from Moscow.
   But some enterprising citizens have lopped off the
Russian-language half of a huge concrete sign at the village of
Sumskas, and left it lying in the dirt. They've repainted the
remaining half to say ``Lithuanian Republic'' and dropped the
``Soviet Socialist'' that used to fall in the middle of the name.
   The Culture Ministry is gathering artist's designs for a
Lithuanian currency and banker Romualdas Visokavicius has already
sought printing bids in West Germany.
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Litva, or Soviet Lithuania, has
changed its name to Eko Litva, or Echo of Lithuania. Control has
been transferred from the Communist Party to the government.
   An enterprising printer has stamped ``Restoration of the
Lithuanian Republic'' over the wording on a decorative Vilnius
envelope, even though it still carries a 5-kopeck Soviet stamp.
   On a recent sunny spring day, workers chipped at the parliament
building to remove a row of Soviet emblems embedded in the front
wall. A few yards away, over the front door, a modern batik in the
Lithuanian colors of yellow, green and red depicts an ancient
Lithuanian knight on horseback. Three weeks ago, it too identified
this as a seat of Soviet power.
   But building a new nation is much more than surface changes, and
Lithuanians are just beginning that part of the task.
   A raft of economic reforms is already drafted. Harvard Economics
Professor Larry Summers has written a plan for switching to a
market economy that calls for swift price reform and introduction
of an independent currency by next year.
   Another American adviser, New York lawyer William Hough of the
firm Walter, Conston, Alexander &amp; Green, has been writing appeals
to foreign governments for formal recognition.
   ``I've been trying to get them to adopt the Delaware Commercial
Code,'' he said the other day.
   Adoption of this standard would give Lithuania a set of rules
for a market economy, simply and quickly, he argued. And it would
encourage foreign investment.
   ``At one stroke, thousands of companies and lawyers around the
world would understand exactly what their law is,'' Hough said.
   Hough said he'd been doing some of his work at the Lithuanian
Foreign Ministry _ an elegant but nearly empty shell that he found
a perfect example of the hollowness of the Soviet Union's claim
that Lithuanian was sovereign while part of the Soviet Union.
   ``They don't even have a library,'' he said.
   The republic is already partially on its way to its own airline.
Air Lithuania doesn't have its name on a single plane, but months
ago it leased the entire Aeroflot operation serving Lithuania, said
Gintautas Preidis, the group's banker.
   Such leasing operations are a key part of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's own economic reforms, and the Lithuanians
have already taken advantage of it to start up direct flights from
Vilnius to East Berlin and Leipzig. Frankfurt is next.
   Some Lithuanians already had passports issued by their
still-functioning embassies abroad. Most West European governments
honor the passports, because they never recognized Soviet
annexation.
   But Soviet KGB troops still control Lithuanian borders, so even
emissaries of the new government had to use their red Soviet
passports to get out of the country.
   When the Soviets barred foreign correspondents, Lithuanian
Foreign Minister Algirdas Saudargas met British correspondent
Edward Lucas as he walked off the once-a-week flight from East
Berlin. Right before the stunned face of a Soviet border guard,
Saudargas issued him a Lithuanian visa. Numbered VT-0001, it
included stamps of both independent and Soviet Lithuania.
   The attempt didn't last long. Lucas was forced to leave Sunday
with the rest of the foreign press corps.
   The Lithuanians were forced to readopt their 1938 constitution,
which is not nearly democratic enough for most activists. This was
done it in part to establish legal continuity with the independent
Lithuanian nation that existed before Soviet occupation and
annexation in 1940.
   But the Lithuanians didn't have a new constitution written,
either.

   Federal judges across the country
increasingly are ordering criminals not only to pay the time for
their crime but to pay the cost of their prison stay.
   From Jan. 19, 1989, through the end of October, federal judges
ordered 254 defendants to pay a monthy fee during their prison
sentence, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission in
Washington, D.C.
   ``We see this as merely an equitable and common sense thing to
do,'' said Judge William Wilkins Jr. of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Richmond, Va., chairman of the seven-member
commission.
   ``If you have the wherewithal to reimburse taxpayers for the
cost of your imprisonment, which you caused through the commission
of a criminal act, then you ought to have to pay,'' Wilkins said.
   Some civil libertarians, however, are objecting. They say the
inmates aren't getting their money's worth because of overcrowded
prison conditions.
   The commission, created in October 1985 after public outcry over
sentencing discrepancies, instituted mandatory sentencing
guidelines to be applied uniformly in federal courts.
   But judges must use discretion in deciding which convicts will
pay for their prison stay. Only those who can afford the monthly
payment of $1,210.05, plus $91.66 a month during probation, can be
ordered to pay.
   Those fees, calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, cannot be
imposed if they would leave the defendant's family destitute or on
welfare, said Paul Martin, a commission spokesman.
   ``It was kind of a very simple thought _ select those folks who
have the ability to pay for their cost of incarceration or
supervision,'' Martin said. ``It's mainly earmarked, of course, for
the `white collar' defendant, someone who has some financial
resource.''
   Of the 45,000 cases that reach federal court every year, few
criminals appear to fit the bill.
   ``Most people who are put away in the federal court system are
indigent. They don't have a dime. I've had clients who didn't have
enough money to buy a six-pack of beer,'' said Ron Wheeler, an
attorney in Des Moines.
   Last year, Wheeler represented a University of Iowa student
charged with possessing LSD with the intent to sell. The student,
Matthew Follett of Kenilworth, Ill., pleaded guilty.
   In August, U.S. District Judge Charles Wolle sentenced Follett
to seven years in prison plus four years of probation.
   Noting that Follett had a substantial trust fund, Wolle also
fined Follett $20,000 and ordered him to pay for his prison stay,
plus the monthly fee during probation.
   ``I don't have any problem with that at all,'' Wheeler said.
``If they're convicted and can pay the cost of being kept in
prison, I think they should.''
   ``It looks nice on paper, but in actuality, there aren't a lot
of these kinds of defendants.''
   In February, in another drug-related case, U.S. District Judge
Francis J. Boyle of Providence, R.I., ordered three men accused of
supplying 75 percent of the city's heroin to pay the costs of their
confinement.
   ``It's the just thing to do,'' Boyle said at the time. ``To the
extent that a defendant is able to pay for it, the defendant should
be required to.''
   Wilkins and others who support the program say requiring inmates
to pay for imprisonment isn't meant as a deterrent.
   ``The deterrent effect comes through the imposition of a prison
term,'' the judge said.
   One critic of the program is Alvin J. Bronstein, director of the
National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, who
noted that the federal prison system is running at 170 percent of
capacity ``and getting worse every month.''
   ``It is clear to me that federal prisons today are basically
unconstitutional because of the conditions of overcrowding,
inadequate medical care and all the problems created by that mass
of overcrowding,'' he said.
   ``It seems unseemly and highly inappropriate _ if not illegal _
to be requiring defendants to pay for room and board, or the cost
of being incarcerated, in an unconstitutional facility,'' Bronstein
said.

   Along the grassy streets of Pearl
Lagoon, on the edge of its lonely dock, in hammocks swaying in the
shade, people are waiting for the Revolution, a ferry boat as
elusive as a campaign promise.
   It sailed into the lagoon on the Sunday after Nicaragua's
election, spent an hour or so, then sailed away.
   A few people rode on the ferry, many just heard of it, but
everyone seems to have an opinion about it.
   ``Some people think it is progress,'' said Irma de Sosa, a
schoolteacher who has become an authority on the subject by virtue
of being one of those who rode.
   ``Some feel like the government is just fooling the people, that
the boat won't come back,'' she said, spreading her hands and
smiling.
   ``We'll just have to wait and see.''
   The Sandinista government, far away in Managua, had long
promised Pearl Lagoon a ferry for the 30-mile run to Bluefields
port, the link to the rest of the world for Nicaragua's thinly
populated Atlantic coast.
   That single visit by the Revolution, a 150-passenger vessel, is
the only evidence residents have seen.
   In many ways, the ferry symbolizes the region's long fight for
autonomy, for some control of its own fate.
   Places like this town of 1,900 are the essence of the Atlantic
coast, an English-speaking area so isolated from the rest of
Nicaragua that it seems like another country.
   Not a shot was fired here when the Sandinistas overthrew the
late President Anastasio Somoza in 1979, and the Atlantic coast was
largely untouched. More than a decade later, there still is no road
between it and the Spanish-speaking Pacific side of Nicaragua.
   It was not the first time revolution passed the region by.
   When the rest of Central America was fighting for independence
from Spain, the coast was a British protectorate with Miskito
Indian royalty. British buccaneers raided the Spanish fleet with
ships built in Pearl Lagoon.
   The Atlantic coast region is home to one-tenth of Nicaragua's
3.3 million people, a rich mixture of Creoles, Latinos and Sumo,
Rama, Garifona and Miskito Indians. It includes half the national
territory of about 50,000 square miles.
   Pearl Lagoon has a couple of Toyota trucks, but the green
streets look more like the fairways of a golf course. It doesn't
receive television from Managua, 200 miles to the west.
   As with most hamlets dotting the coves, inlets and rivers, water
is Pearl Lagoon's only link to the world.
   A regular ferry, a boat of its own, would mean a measure of
independence and an end to the balmy isolation that envelops the
lagoon like a daydream.
   The Atlantic coast is the poorest region of one of the
hemisphere's poorest nations, but Pearl Lagoon is a fortune in the
raw.
   It rests on the banks of one of the richest breeding grounds of
the succulent white shrimp, on the edge of rich lobster beds. It is
the kind of place that feeds the dreams of entrepreneurs.
   A businessman remembered simply as The Chinaman, the lagoon's
last success story, dried and exported shrimp. The Sandinistas
confiscated his shrimp plant, fishing boats and rice mill, and
drove The Chinaman into exile.
   ``The boats went to Bluefields,'' said Leslie Hunsack, a
60-year-old fisherman. ``It did us no good here in Pearl Lagoon.''
   After the Sandinistas nationalized the fishing industry, Pearl
Lagoon was left with a single customer that set its own price: the
government.
   Fishermen say months sometimes pass between the visits by boats
from outside to pick up the catch. ``We have our nets out and we
catch this fish and we can't do anything with it,'' said Linton
Fox, a community leader.
   At least two young fishermen have died trying to make an extra
dollar a pound on their lobster. They were shot by government
agents while on smuggling runs to the Colombian island of San
Andreas, 110 miles southeast of Pearl Lagoon.
   ``We have always felt like a colony inside a country,'' said
labor leader Alvin Guthrie, a Creole from the coast elected to the
new National Assembly. ``Under the Sandinistas, it was like having
Spanish viceroys around.''
   In the northern Atlantic coast region, the Managua government's
attempts to enforce its policies provoked a bloody uprising of
Miskito Indians.
   Finally, the Sandinistas admitted they had made mistakes and
passed a regional autonomy law that, at least in theory, was the
most sweeping in Latin America.
   Autonomy remains a promise, however, not a reality.
   Members of the first autonomous councils, one for the north
coast and one for the south, where Pearl Lagoon and Bluefields are
located, were chosen in the Feb. 25 general elections.
   Still to be negotiated is the relationship between the regional
and central governments, at heart a question of control over gold,
lumber and fishing resources.
   ``We don't know much about autonomy,'' said Fox, a member of the
regional assembly. ``But we'd have the rights to our property. Our
lumber, our fish, our shrimps would go to build up our little town,
not to build up Managua or Bluefields.''
   The Sandinistas failed to overcome the suspicions and
hostilities of the coast with the autonomy project. Like the rest
of Nicaragua, the coast voted against them in the February election.
   Sandinista leaders predict autonomy would die under the
government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, which takes
office April 25.
   Her conservative alliance's platform does not mention autonomy
and Sandinista leaders say its goal of privatization is
incompatible with local control of the region's riches.
   ``The backbone for autonomy is the natural resources, what is in
the sea and what is in the forest,'' said Johnny Hodgson, a
Sandinista leader in Bluefields.
   British and American companies that exploited the coast, the
Somoza dictatorship, the Sandinistas _ none brought prosperity or
gave the coast a real say in its affairs.
   Hunsack, the fisherman, picked up his saw and prepared to cut
another board.
   He is tired of waiting for the Revolution, and is building his
own boat.
   ``This autonomy the Sandinistas had, they were using people as a
tool,'' Hunsack said. ``We expect better. We couldn't get worse.''

<HEAD>Historian: Trotsky Feared His Jewish Roots Would Hurt Revolution</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leon Trotsky resisted Vladimir Ilyich Lenin's
offers to become the Soviet revolutionary leader's successor
because he feared his Jewish origins would hurt the communist
cause, according to a new historical study.
   Soviet historian Victor Danilov says a document has come to
light that contains Trotsky's only known explanation for turning
down Lenin's offers of high office.
   Writing in History Workshop, a journal published by Oxford
University Press, Danilov cites what he says is a hitherto
unpublished speech Trotsky made at a congress of senior Soviet
communists held Oct. 25-27, 1923.
   Trotsky was Lenin's partner in leading the 1917 revolution, but
now Lenin was ill, and Josef Stalin and his supporters were
maneuvering to oust Trotsky from the leadership.
   Defending himself to the congress against charges that he lusted
for power, Trotsky sought to demonstrate how he consistently shied
away from high office, Danilov wrote.
   ``The fact is, comrades, that there is one personal aspect of my
work, which although playing no role in my personal life and my
day-to-day existence, is nonetheless of great political
significance. This is my Jewish origin,'' Trotsky was quoted as
saying.
   ``I clearly remember Vladimir Ilyich stretched out on the floor
in the Smolny (his Leningrad headquarters) on 25 October (1917) and
saying to me: `We must make you People's Commissar of the Interior,
Comrade Trotsky. You shall crush the bourgeoisie and the
aristocracy!'
   ``And I refused. I said that in my opinion there was no point in
playing into the hands of our enemies. `It would be far better,' I
said, `if there was not a single Jew in the first Soviet
revolutionary government.' `Stuff and nonsense!' Vladimir Ilyich
said. `That's all rubbish!' However, my words evidently had their
effect, for I was not appointed Commissar of the Interior but of
foreign policy _ although to be honest, I was equally loth to
accept this post.''
   According to the speech, Trotsky also was reluctant to take on
the post of war commissar, and ``I was right. ... Remember how at
critical moments of the Yudenich, Kolchak and Wrangel military
campaigns, our enemies were able to exploit the fact that the Red
Army was headed by a Jew. This was a very great inconvenience to
us.''
   Trotsky was born Lev Davidovich Bronstein into a middle-class
Russian Jewish family. Trotsky was an alias he assumed while on the
run from czarist authorities.
   He was quoted as saying in the speech that Lenin thought his
preoccupation with being Jewish was ``merely a personal whim of
mine, and frequently referred to it as such in conversations with
me and other comrades.''
   When Lenin offered to make him his sole deputy, in effect lining
him up as an heir apparent, ``I firmly turned down his offer on the
grounds, as before, that we should not give our enemies the
opportunity to say that our country was being ruled by a Jew. I
think Vladimir Ilyich agreed with me. Although he again said:
`stuff and nonsense!', I felt that he said it this time with less
conviction, and that privately he agreed with me.''
   Danilov wrote that Trotsky's speech was recorded in summary by
Stalin's assistant, B. Bazhanov, and came to light only now, when
the Soviet policy of glasnost is allowing historians to enter
once-forbidden areas.
   Danilov wrote there was no reason to distrust Bazhanov's
account, ``so fully does it convey the sincerity and conviction of
Trotsky's words, and so damningly does it reflect upon the
organizers of this kangaroo court.''
   Lenin died a year later. Trotsky was expelled from the Communist
Party in 1927 and transformed by Stalinist propaganda into the
archenemy of the people. He went into exile and ended up in Mexico,
where he was murdered in 1940, by an acquaintance described by
Trotsky's friends as a Stalin agent.

   Willie Nelson hopes the fourth Farm Aid
concert can elicit greater support for the family farmer.
   The singer and fellow organizers, musicians John Mellencamp and
Neil Young, had hoped they had performed their final Farm Aid
concert when they left the stage in 1988 in Lincoln, Neb.
   ``We thought the problem might have gone away by now,'' Nelson,
the president of Farm Aid, said last week in a telephone interview
from Montreal, where he was on tour.
   Farm Aid IV will be held Saturday in the Hoosier Dome before
45,000 people.
   The tentative lineup of more than 60 acts includes Guns N'
Roses, Bonnie Raitt, Don Henley, Bruce Hornsby, Richard Marx, John
Denver, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Jackson Browne, Dwight Yoakum, K.T.
Oslin and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The cable Nashville Network will
carry the show from noon to midnight.
   The concert sold out in less than 90 minutes, but Nelson said
urban problems such as homelessness and unemployment dilute the
concern city dwellers hold for the struggle of family farmers.
   ``There's a lot of apathy out there. It's a little difficult for
someone living in a big city to get excited about what's happening
on the farm,'' he said.

   Christian Slater, who appeared in
``Heathers'' and ``The Wizard,'' pleaded no contest to his second
drunken driving charge in a year and was sentenced to 10 days in
jail.
   The 20-year-old actor also was placed Monday on five years'
probation, lost his driver's license for 18 months and was ordered
to pay nearly $1,400 in fines and penalties.
   Prosecutors dropped charges of resisting arrest and battery on a
police officer in exchange for his no contest pleas to drunken
driving and evading arrest.
   Slater was arrested Dec. 29 after he led deputies on a chase
that began when they spotted his car going 50 mph in a 35 mph zone
and ended with the car crashing into two telephone poles.
   Slater jumped out, ran and was climbing a fence when a deputy
dragged him down, getting kicked in the face by Slater's cowboy
boots, authorities said.
   The actor, who was convicted of drunken driving in 1989, has
agreed to join Alcoholics Anonymous and to enter an alcohol
treatment center, said Deputy District Attorney Randi Kaplan.

   Singer Gloria Estefan, whose back was broken
when her tour bus was hit by a truck, is expected to be released
from the hospital Wednesday.
   Estefan has been at the Orthopedic Institute Hospital for Joint
Diseases, where doctors on March 22 implanted two steel rods in her
back.
   She will continue her rehabilitation from two fractured
vertebrae at home, hospital spokeswoman Mary Costello said Monday.
   Doctors said it would take the Cuban-born performer up to six
months to fully recover.
   The operation came one day after she was injured when her bus
was struck by a tractor-trailer in Pennsylvania.
   Estefan, 32, was nominated for a Grammy Award this year for
``Don't Wanna Lose You,'' a song from her solo album.

   ``Little House on the Prairie'' star Melissa
Gilbert says her life is wonderful since her husband,
actor-screenwriter Bo Brinkman, has received help for alcohol abuse.
   ``Our marriage counselor saved our lives and our marriage,'' the
25-year-old Miss Gilbert said in the April 7 issue of TV Guide.
``We couldn't live apart anymore.''
   Miss Gilbert, whose teen-age romance with actor Rob Lowe was the
stuff of tabloid columns, had been living apart from Brinkman since
he became drunk and flew into a rage last year in Hong Kong where
she was filming a TV movie, she said.
   Miss Gilbert said she and Lowe remain good friends since ending
their relationship three years ago.
   ``What we had was a passionate childhood infatuation,'' she
said. ``But, ultimately, I think we realized that although there
was a lot of passion and fun between us, it was not the calm,
soothing type of material you need for a marriage.''

   Selleck spoke last week in favor of keeping the state-operated
film studio at its present location on the back slopes of Diamond
Head. A neighborhood group has expressed concern noise and traffic
generated by the studio takes away from the natural beauty.
   ``I care about the film industry here,'' said Selleck, who has

   The 52nd Ramp Festival will not be hard
to find this weekend. Just get within hailing distance of the city
and follow your nose.
   ``As long as everybody is eating them at one time, it's OK,''
said Bruce Donaldson, owner of a supermarket that has sold the
potent greens for years. ``If you have to smell someone else who's
been eating them, that's pretty bad.''
   Ramp, a wild leek, is grown on the mountains surrounding
Richwood. Ramp season opens in late winter, but this year started
in January because of warm weather. Some brave souls pickle the
garlicky treat for eating year-round.
   The Richwood Chamber of Commerce plans to give out free
memberships in the ``NRA'' for each ticket sold to the annual ramp
feed Saturday, which includes ham, buttermilk, other vegetables,
sassafras tea and, of course, ramps.
   ``This NRA is the National Ramp Association.'' said Maxine
Corbett, executive secretary of the chamber. ``Which is worse? I'm
not sure. A lot of people in the National Rifle Association might
like to shoot people in the other NRA.''
   The reason is obvious, Donaldson said.
   ``Most people I know like them, but they just don't like the
aftermath,'' he said.

   ``Some of her friends said because I was short I wouldn't ever
amount to much,'' he said. ``They tried to discourage it.''
   Don, at about 5 feet, may be short, but the marriage wasn't. The
couple celebrated 77 years together on Monday.
   ``We've never had a quarrel _ yet,'' Mrs. Wall said. ``We try to
be kind and patient with each other.''
   The Walls, who are 98 years old, remain self-sufficient, live in
the same home they have occupied since 1952 and have six children.
The oldest are Dean Wall and Jean Lee, twins born on New Year's Day
75 years ago. Their youngest is 60.
   Wall finds it hard keeping track of all the

   For the past several months, a squad of
Cuban military pilots have been on 24-hour alert for the attack of
an invisible enemy. Last week, the first assault came.
   The United States started sending TV Marti signals toward Cuba.
The signal has carried mostly replays of old sports events and
comedy shows, but the Cuban government regards it as a deadly
serious offensive.
   ``This is a war; they have begun it,'' said Lt. Col. Thais
Martinez, gesturing toward the United States as he spoke Monday to
foreign journalists at Baracoa air base, a half-hour drive from
Havana.
   About 120 feet away stood two Soviet-made helicopters, key
elements in the anti-TV Marti defense system.
   The helicopters take off as soon as TV Marti begins to penetrate
Cuban air space. Apparently with the help of on-board transmitters,
the choppers are able to interfere with the signal.
   Martinez is pleased with the results.
   ``Everything has been covered,'' he said, contending that TV
Marti's signal _ emanating from a balloon off southern Florida _
has been almost completely unable to reach Cuban TV sets for more
than a few minutes.
   The work of the helicopters is supplemented by two tall TV
antennas in Havana, also with jamming capability.
   TV Marti is the video version of Radio Marti, the 5-year-old
station designed to bring entertainment and balanced news to Cuba.
Both are run by the U.S. government's Voice of America.
   Transmissions of TV Marti are being sent during the early
morning hours and the Bush administration says that after the
current testing phase is over, it will decide whether the project
is technologically and legally feasible.
   President Bush told a convention of the National Association of
Broadcasters in Atlanta on Monday that TV Marti will keep
transmitting despite concerns Cuba's President Fidel Castro may
widen his jamming of U.S. radio stations. In retaliation for TV
Marti's transmissions, the Cubans have jammed the signals of AM
radio stations in the U.S. Southeast.
   Cubans not sympathetic to their government are eager for TV
Marti to succeed, contending it will bring a new dimension to the
drab fare now available from local programming.
   But to Cuban officialdom and to many ordinary citizens, the
initiative is just another example of U.S. imperialism at work.
   ``It's a question of dignity,'' said Col. Jose Herrera.
   Martinez said several bases are involved in the same type of
jamming operations as the Baracoa facility.
   He said the efficiency of the jamming operation has grown by the
day. The first day, jamming started after 10 minutes (the State
Department claims it was 23) and the figure has dropped
progressively since.
   It now takes only three minutes, said Martinez.
   But the intereference is costly.
   First Lt. Gustavo Sojo said the helicopters use up about 225
gallons of gasoline per hour, a substantial amount for a country as
small and hard-pressed as Cuba. That's about $1,200 per helicopter
for four hours in the air.
   Despite the costs, the government appears prepared to stand firm
against the airwaves incursion.
   `We are ready to resist for whatever time is necessary,'' said
Martinez.

<HEAD>Mitchell Putting Brakes on Panama-Nicaragua Aid Package</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: House meets at noon EDT; action likely on supplemental

   President Bush won't get $800 million to aid
new democracies in Panama and Nicaragua until he produces a broad
spending plan showing how the money serves U.S. goals, says Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell.
   Mitchell's warning poses new difficulties for the aid package,
which Bush wants enacted by Thursday before Congress adjourns for a
12-day Easter recess. The money bill was scheduled for House action
today, but its chances for completion this week appeared dim.
   Bush had hoped to provide the money _ $500 million for Panama
and $300 million for Nicaragua _ quickly as a tangible
demonstration of the benefits of democracy and to aid Panamanian
President Guillermo Endara and Nicaraguan President-elect Violeta
Chamorro.
   The House Appropriations Committee approved the money bill last
week, but only after swelling it to $2.4 billion by adding money
for domestic disaster relief, food stamps, veterans' benefits and
other items.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, complained Monday that the aid for Panama and
Nicaragua was being sought without proper justification and without
regard to how it fits with overall U.S. goals.
   ``The administration is asking Congress to put together a jigsaw
puzzle without any overall picture and without all the pieces,''
Mitchell said in a statement that called the White House approach
``piecemeal.''
   He said he hoped to have the Senate begin work Wednesday on a
companion bill setting up aid programs for the two countries. But
that bill contains no money to fund the programs.
   ``By approaching foreign aid on a country-by-country basis and
in one-shot increments, the administration has provided no overall
or long-term view of how all the pieces can and should fit
together,'' Mitchell said.
   ``They have provided no rationale as to how this request relates
to other parts of the budget _ to other foreign aid spending, to
defense or domestic spending, to the deficit,'' he said.
   Mitchell contended the administration has provided no plan for
future aid to the two Central American countries, or how their
priority for aid compares with that of emerging democracies in
Eastern Europe and elsewhere.
   Mitchell further spelled out his request in a letter to
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, saying the spending plan
should cover plans for the next three to five years for foreign
aid, defense spending, domestic spending and the deficit.
   The administration has not explained ``the relationship between
this request and our overall national security objectives,''
Mitchell told Baker.
   ``I believe it is essential that the Senate have such a plan
before it appropriates the emergency aid requested by the
administration for Panama and Nicaragua.''
   Administration officials testifying before Congress have said
the money is needed as a speedy response to conditions that could
not have been foreseen when the White House wrote its budget for
this year. The administration wants to pay for the aid through cuts
in the Pentagon budget.
   Officials have said they regard the aid to Panama as a one-time
infusion to ``jump-start'' the country's stalled economy. For
Nicaragua, the administration has asked an additional $200 million
for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   Mitchell said he would not delay in meeting ``the genuine
emergency needs for Panama and Nicaragua.'' But he added: ``I do
not believe we should appropriate the full amount requested until
the administration submits a meaningful, long-term foreign aid
plan.''
   In the first spurt of U.S. aid to emerging democracies, Mitchell
and Senate Democrats led the way last year in providing millions
for Poland and Hungary. Mitchell called Bush ``timid'' for not
doing more for emerging democracies.
   In a brief interview, Mitchell said Monday's statement was not
inconsistent with last year's action, but was a response to ``the
sheer number of these one-shot requests. When they accumulate in
number, the need for an overall plan becomes apparent.''

<HEAD>Congress Asked to Continue Support for Producers of Luxury Fabric</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The whims of fashion can be cruel, say mohair
producers who raise goats in the cactus-studded Southwest, as they
seek continued government aid for the times when designers shun
their luxury yarn.
   Prices received by U.S. mohair producers ``depend on how the
fashion designers in Europe want to treat us,'' says Brian J. May,
executive director of the Mohair Council of America in San Angelo,
Texas.
   The mohair producers are asking Congress to continue payments to
some of the 3,500 Texans who raise Angora goats _ animals suited to
a unique expanse of arid and brushy land in West and Central Texas.
Small numbers of Angora goats also are raised in New Mexico and
Arizona.
   Nationwide, about 10,000 ranch families _ including 5,000 Navajo
Indians _ tend the Angora goat, whose fleece finds its way into
$2,000 suits in Japan or hand-knitted sweaters in Europe. The
United States, Turkey and South Africa produce most of the world's
50 million pounds of mohair.
   Prices have dipped low enough during 17 of the last 35 years to
trigger payments from the Agriculture Department to mohair
producers, May said.
   The government paid an average of $42 million a year during
1986-1988 when mohair prices were the lowest in more than a decade,
the department said. That total represents almost 56 percent of all
government payments made since 1962.
   Some years, May said, prices dip so far below the cost of
production ``it would be disastrous'' without the federal aid.
   May contends Congress should renew the program while it drafts
the 1990 farm bill. He says the program, financed through a tariff
on imported wool and mohair, would help keep mohair producers in
business as their trade association seeks new ways to beat market
volatility through new overseas outlets and new fabrics.
   All but 2 percent of domestic mohair is exported, with Europe
leading the list of customers, followed by Asia and India. The
industry completed its first sale to China less than a year ago,
selling nearly $1 million of the brushy yarn, and closed its first
sale, worth $1.5 million, with the Soviet Union in December and
January, May said.
   Overseas sales of mohair have totaled more than $200 million in
the past 35 years, he said. May hopes the thaw in relations with
Eastern Europe will expand markets for mohair and help improve the
U.S. balance of trade.
   The government's support also keeps otherwise-inhospitable land
in production, May said. In some parts of Southwest Texas, wool and
mohair account for 80 percent of all agricultural income.
   ``No one is going to cut up rocks and cactus land for real
estate,'' May said. ``You can't run cattle out there. These people
aren't getting rich off the government. We're maintaining this
area's resources. We're using what would normally be considered a
very minimal-type rangeland and making it a productive way of life
for these counties to survive.''
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, added: ``It may be a luxury fabric,
but if you're tending Angora goats in the Hill Country of Texas,
it's a tough, hard way to make a living.''
   May said Angora goats contribute to water conservation by eating
water-wasting woody brush plants, and are often used _ instead of
toxic chemicals _ to open up brush-infested pasture land.
   But the Agriculture Department, in a report on wool and mohair,
questioned whether there should be a program for wool and mohair, a
declining industry since World War II.
   ``Today, the wool program is under scrutiny because of its
objectives and its rising costs,'' the report said, asking whether
the program's costs have exceeded acceptable limits.
   It said total wool and mohair spending was estimated at $130.6
million in 1988, about 1 percent of the $12.5 billion in spending
on agricultural price supports and related programs.

<HEAD>GOP Chairman Undergoing Treatment in New York for Brain Tumor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Party chairman Lee Atwater is
undergoing a new course of treatment for a brain tumor that a party
official concedes is more serious than originally thought.
   Doctors treating Atwater, 39, said the tumor ``has the potential
to behave aggressively,'' a phrase repeated Monday in a statement
issued by Mary Matalin, the Republican Party chief of staff.
   Atwater was at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, where
doctors planned to implant radioactive isotopes in the tumor in an
effort to kill it.
   Since the tumor was diagnosed March 6, Atwater has undergone
daily radiation treatments.
   B.J. Cooper, communications director at the Republican National
Committee, said Atwater has conferred with several doctors since
the original diagnosis and the consensus was that the growth was an
astrocytoma located in the right frontal lobe.
   ``Make no mistake, it's serious,'' said Cooper, who said there
now was a clearer sense of its seriousness.
   ``We've learned a lot more,'' he said.
   Doctors not involved in Atwater's case agreed that the type of
tumor described was persistent and dangerous.
   Dr. Stuart Grossman, director of neurological oncology at the
Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore, said astrocytomas ``are
tough tumors to cure. They do have a tendency to come back.''
   Astrocytomas are graded I through IV, although grade IV is
usually called by another name. The announcement did not identify
the grade of Atwater's tumor.
   ``All of these types of tumors are potentially curable and
potentially fatal,'' said Dr. R. William Harter, an associate
professor of radiation oncology at Georgetown University Hospital
here.
   Harter said for a grade I astrocytoma the five-year survival
rate is about 50 percent when treated aggressively. For grade II,
he said, the five-year survival rate is 25 percent, and for grade
III it is 10 to 20 percent. Grade IV tumors, which are more
commonly called glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma,
are always fatal, said Harter.
   Grossman cautioned, however: ``A five-year survival does not
equal cure. These types of tumors usually come back.''
   Another doctor, who asked not to be quoted, said patients with
astrocytomas ``run a substantial risk of dying from this disease at
some point.''
   Atwater was expected to remain in the hospital for about a week
and then return to his Washington home where, according to the RNC,
he probably would rest for several weeks.
   Cooper said the chairman had been coming into party headquarters
daily before he went to New York.
   He said day-to-day matters were being handled by Jeanie Austin,
the party co-chairman, and Matalin.
   ``Lee, to this point, has been involved in all major
decisions,'' said Cooper.

   Charges against an American Civil Liberties
Union attorney could be reinstated if the most restrictive U.S.
abortion law is upheld in federal courts, a territorial official
said Monday.
   The charges agaisnt Janet Benshoof were dropped by Territorial
Attorney General Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson, who said she wanted to
await the outcome of a federal court case before proceeding with
any criminal action.
   A memo filed in Superior Court by Assistant Attorney General
Dianne Pierson asked for dismissal of the complaint because the
federal court has placed a hold on enforcement of the anti-abortion
statute in this U.S. territory in the Pacific Ocean.
   Benshoof was charged March 21, two days after the law was
signed, with solicitation to commit abortion. The complaint against
her was filed following a speech in which she encouraged women
seeking abortions to travel to Hawaii.
   The new law prohibits abortion except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the woman.
   U.S. District Judge Alex Munson issued a restraining order on
March 23. The order is to remain in effect until a lawsuit
challenging the law in heard in federal court on May 8.
   If the federal court finds the law to be constitutional, there
is a possibility Benshoof could be re-charged for violating the
statute, Barrett-Anderson said.
   In another development, Gov. Joseph Ada failed to show for a
deposition hearing Monday in connection with the lawsuit.
   Munson denied Ada's request that the court issue a protective
order on the grounds that Ada's testimony was privileged
information and not relevant to the case.
   Munson said Ada's testimony is pertinent to the outcome of the
case, and ordered Ada to give a deposition.

   Brent Musburger gave a thumbs-up sign to his fans
at the end of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
basketball championship Monday, and promised a comeback at the end
of his last broadcast on CBS.
   ``Folks, I've had the best seat in the house. Thanks for sharing
it. I'll see you down the road,'' Musberger said in his final
signoff for the network he had worked at for more than two decades.
   The network announced Sunday that it wouldn't renew Musburger's
$2 million-a-year contract after it expires June 30.
   Musburger waited until the final moments of CBS' broadcast of
the University of Nevada, Las Vegas' 103-73 victory over Duke
University before saying farewell.
   ``As you know,'' he said, ``this was my last assignment with CBS
after 22 years with the television network, radio network and the
stations. And I had an opportunity to work with the greatest
directors, producers, technicians in the world. Not to mention
analysts, like my good friend Billy Packer. Billy, we have shared
some great memories.''
   Musburger than put his arm around Packer.
   ``Brent, we saw a great champion here tonight,'' said Packer,
the former Wake Forest coach turned announcer. ``It's been an honor
for all of us to work with a great champion of broadcasting.''
   After the broadcast was over, fans at McNichols Arena shouted
encouragement.
   ``You're a pro, baby,'' one yelled.
   Musburger raised an arm to the crowd and gave a ``No. 1'' sign
with his index finger extended. He gave a thumbs-up, and shook
hands with Packer and much of the crew.
   Musburger did not answer questions. Jimmy Tubbs, Musburger's
personal assistant, said the broadcaster would not discuss his
departure from CBS while in Denver, but would be available for
questions later in the week.
   The main issues in Musberger's contract dispute apparently were
money and high-profile assignments, CBS officials said. Musburger,
the network's most prominent sportscaster, wanted more of both than
the network was willing to give him.
   CBS' most pressing problem in replacing Musburger is to find
another No. 1 baseball broadcaster before airing its first game
April 14. Musburger also was in line to be host of the network's
coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics.
   CBS leads the networks in major sports broadcasts with coverage
of major league baseball, the National Football League, the
National Basketball Association, the NCAA tournament, the U.S. Open
Tennis tournament, the Masters golf tournament and college
football. NBC takes over NBA coverage next fall.
   Musburger was to have teamed with Tim McCarver on major league
baseball telecasts. Al Michaels is considered the top candidate to
replace Musburger if ABC lets him out of his contract, which runs
into 1993. Michaels, an experienced baseball announcer, is
reportedly feuding with ABC Sports President Dennis Swanson and
might be interested in the CBS job.
   Michaels' agent, Art Kaminsky, declined to speculate about his
client's chances of switching networks.
   ``It's inappropriate,'' Kaminsky said. ``Brent has been there
for 15 years and this is so sudden. I and everyone else owe him
some respect. We should let him work the game'' before talking
about his successor, he said.
   Swanson, asked whether ABC would let Michaels out of his
contract, said, ``I don't comment on hypothetical questions.''
   If CBS can't get Michaels, it might try to lure Bob Costas from
NBC. But Costas, whose first love is baseball, also has a contract
running into 1993. Costas would lose his late-night talk show and
scheduled NBA assignment if he left NBC.
   Another possibility is simply filling Musburger's roles with
other CBS announcers. CBS Sports President Neal Pilson wants to
give younger CBS sportscasters such as Jim Nantz, Greg Gumbel and
James Brown expanded duties at the network.
   ``He's got a lot of talent there,'' Kaminsky said. ``He can take
care of this internally if he chooses.''

   ``I rely every day on the security of a GTI
vest,'' says Oliver L. North in a catalogue promoting his own line
of body armor _ more popularly known as bullet-proof vests.
   North, the linchpin of the Iran-Contra affair, has gone into
business with another key figure in the scandal, former CIA station
chief Joseph Fernandez.
   The pair, fired from their government jobs, are the sole
proprietors of Guardian Technologies International, which will
manufacture lightweight vests.
   ``There is no other partner,'' Fernandez said. ``It's our idea,
our money and our effort. Ollie North is the chairman and I'm the
president of the company.''
   Guardian will use a material called Spectra, made by aerospace
manufacturer Allied-Signal Corp. Fernandez contended it is lighter
than other material used in vests and therefore more likely to be
worn by police officers who don't like body armor because it is too
bulky.
   ``We are looking ahead for our future,'' Fernandez said.
``Obviously, with our experience and background, we feel
comfortable dealing with America's law enforcement community.''
   North, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, was convicted last
year of three felony counts stemming from his role as a White House
aide helping the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. He was assessed no jail
time and has been out on the lecture circuit with speech fees of
$25,000.
   Fernandez, once CIA station chief in Costa Rica, was charged
with obstructing inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair by the CIA
inspector general and the Tower Commission. But the indictment was
dismissed after Attorney General Dick Thornburgh refused to release
classified information.
   GTI's eight-page, full-color brochure shows vests worn under
shirts, over shirts, as safari jackets and rain coats and the
outfits worn by SWAT teams. One of the models was North's bodyguard
during his trial last year and on his speechmaking trips around the
country.
   A subcontractor will turn out the garments until the
North-Fernandez firm has its own production facilities, Fernandez
said.
   ``We have an affinity for America's law enforcement officers and
whenever Ollie travels around the country, he had the good fortune
to meet many of these officers,'' Fernandez said. ``The growing
risk we see on the streets today as a result of drug trafficking
and violent crimes just made it a natural area we want to work in.''

<HEAD>Nine Mining Workers Die in Bomb Attack, Curfew Imposed In Some
Regions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded in a van carrying mine
employees along a road in the Andes, killing nine workers and
throwing debris hundreds of feet, military authorities said. They
blamed the attack on Shining Path rebels.
   The workers of the state-owned mining company Centromin-Peru
were traveling through Azulcocha, about 120 miles east of Lima, on
Monday when the dynamite charge was set off by remote control, the
officials said.
   Eight victims were private guards hired to protect the mines and
the ninth was a driver, they said.
   The attack comes as the Maoist-inspired Shining Path guerrillas
step up bombings and assassinations in an effort to thwart Sunday's
general elections.
   On Monday, the government scrapped plans to mark voters' fingers
with a special dye to prevent vote fraud. The Shining Path has
threatened anyone wh casts a ballot Sunday.
   Voting is required by law, and voters who fail to cast ballots
face fines and other penalties.
   Local officials on Monday imposed an overnight curfew in the
cities of La Oroya, Huancayo, Concepcion, Jauja, Chanchamayo and
Satipo. The curfew is meant to ensure order during the elections.
   About a third of Peru, including Lima, is under a state of
emergency. The guerrillas operate mainly in the Andean highlands
but occasionally launch attacks in Lima.
   More than 18,000 people have been killed since the Shining Path
launched its insurgency in 1980, government officials say.

   Republicans are expressing confidence that
labor lawyer T. Timothy Ryan Jr. will win Senate approval to run
the savings and loan bailout despite disclosures that he used
marijuana and cocaine in the 1970s.
   ``In my view, the nominee will be confirmed,'' Senate GOP Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas said Monday after huddling over the weekend with
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on salvaging President Bush's
nomination of Ryan to head the Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Ryan, 44, who was the Labor Department's chief legal officer in
the first two years of the Reagan administration, barely survived a
11-10 vote last Friday in the Senate Banking Committee, where
Democrats sharply criticized his lack of knowledge and experience
on thrifts and banking.
   Just hours later, NBC News disclosed that Ryan had admitted to
the FBI and Bush administration officials that he had occasionally
used marijuana and tried cocaine ``once, perhaps twice'' in the
1970s.
   ``I would hope that the nomination of Mr. Ryan will be acted on
this week,'' Dole said, referring to estimates that savings and
loans losses are continuing to drain the Treasury of $20 million to
$30 million weekly.
   Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., a
chief opponent of Ryan's nomination, also called for a speedy vote.
Riegle had predicted his panel would vote down the nomination, but
that was before the administration launched a lobbying blitz on
Ryan's behalf.
   ``Mr. Ryan clearly lacks the necessary professional
qualifications for what is the single most complex and important
financial job in our country today,'' Riegle said. ``Hundreds of
billions of dollars are at stake.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, would not
venture a guess Monday ``how the substance abuse issue will affect
the vote.''
   ``That's a matter for each senator,'' Mitchell said. ``I think
there is widespread concern about the thoroughness of his
qualifications for such an important job.''
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said Ryan's admission that he dabbled
in drugs should be placed in its proper historical context of the
Vietnam war era.
   Warner said Ryan made a mistake in trying drugs, but added: ``No
matter how serious the mistake was, it seems to me that that
generation was subjected to a most unusual period of history and as
such we should examine each case individually today.''
   But Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the House Banking
Committee's financial institutions subcommittee, questioned Ryan's
suitability for the job in light of the drug disclosure.
   ``The man admitted he was on cocaine; he admitted he was on
marijuana,'' Annunzio said. ``What's that say to children you're
telling to `just say no.' He sure puts a crimp on the war on
drugs.''
   The Senate Banking Committee had access to the FBI files but
Ryan's acknowledged drug use never arose during his confirmation
hearings.

<HEAD>Administration Stays Firm in Opposing Use of Fetal Tissue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is standing firm in
its prohibition against federal fetal tissue research because it
believes the research would bring increased abortions, a government
health official says.
   Dr. James O. Mason, assistant secretary for health in the
Department of Health and Human Services, defended the ban before a
House subcommittee on Monday and said it would remain in place
until he saw evidence the research would not increase abortions.
   Researchers say the use of fetal cells has the potential to help
patients suffering Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's
diseases, as well as paralysis, diabetes and other illnesses. But
the research is opposed by abortion opponents.
   Mason said the possibility an aborted fetus could have medical
benefits for others would provide a ``powerful inducement'' and an
``additional rationalization'' for a woman agonizing over whether
to abort her pregnancy.
   The result, he said, would be to ``tilt some already vulnerable
women toward a decision to have an abortion.''
   Mason commented under sharp questioning by Rep. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., at a hearing of the health subcommittee that Waxman
chairs.
   The ban prohibits federal funding to research the implantation
of fetal cells into humans. Private research continues, Waxman said.
   He said the administration's order was a result of ``misplaced
allegiance to the most extreme elements of the anti-abortion
movement.''
   ``This is wrong, scientifically and ethically,'' Waxman argued.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush can shift money to military
personnel accounts to avoid laying off troops, but it must come
from the Strategic Defense Initiative, the B-2 bomber or two other
prized weapons programs, the chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee says.
   ``It must be clearly established that military people are a
higher priority than hardware,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said
Monday in a letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Aspin said he does not oppose ``some relief for our men and
women in uniform'' but that the source of the money must be several
of the administration's prized strategic weapons.
   ``Funds for any reprogramming relief for fiscal year 1990 must
come from four of the favored weapons programs that were earlier
spared larger cuts: SDI, B-2, SSN-21 attack submarine and the
Army's light helicopter program,'' the chairman said.
   In addition, Aspin is seeking public assurances from Cheney and
White House budget chief Richard Darman that the attempt to shift
funds to avoid the impact of the Gramm-Rudman budget-cutting law
won't happen again.
   Meanwhile, a Pentagon source said Monday that Cheney is
determined to find money to cover the personnel expenses, even if
he has to shift funds from other accounts without congressional
approval.
   The defense secretary has legal authority to shift up to $3
billion among accounts without specific approval from Capitol Hill.
But such a step might anger lawmakers, since such transfers are
supposed to cover only unexpected shortfalls.
   The source expressed confidence that an agreement would be
worked out by the end of the week, when Congress leaves for its
Easter recess.
   Aspin and several lawmakers planned to meet with Cheney today to
discuss the issue.
   Aspin had blocked Bush's attempt to transfer $852 million from
several Pentagon accounts to military personnel to avoid massive
layoffs.
   The president had the option last August to exempt personnel
accounts from the Gramm-Rudman law. But Pentagon officials
testified recently that they did not urge him to exclude those
accounts on the assumption that Congress would agree to the
transfer.
   Four congressional committees are required to approve such a
shift in defense funds, and Aspin declined to bring the issue up in
his committee.
   ``I objected to your fiscal year 1990 reprogramming requests for
personnel because they represented an attempt to ease the pain of
Gramm-Rudman ... on the Pentagon, but nowhere else,'' Aspin said in
his letter to Cheney. ``That was and is unacceptable.''

<HEAD>U.S. Cigarette Consumption Lowest Since 1942</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are smoking less than any time since
1942.
   The Agriculture Department says cigarette use dropped 5 percent
in 1989, the largest decline in six years. And the trend is
expected to continue.
   Overall, American smokers consumed about 533 billion cigarettes
last year, the department's Economic Research Service said Monday.
Exports, however, jumped 20 percent to 142 billion cigarettes.
   Annual use by the U.S. adult population dropped 7 percent to an
average of 2,888 cigarettes, the report said. Economist Verner
Grise said that was the lowest average since 1942, when the average
was 2,585 cigarettes per adult.
   The peak was 4,345 cigarettes in 1963, before beginning its
longtime decline.
   The average is for all Americans 18 years and older, smokers and
non-smokers alike. It is a statistical comparison only and does not
indicate the actual smoking habits of the population.
   ``Domestic cigarette consumption will probably continue to fall
this year because of higher prices, increased restrictions on where
people can smoke, anti-smoking activity and declining social
acceptance of smoking,'' the report said.
   Meanwhile, the report said total U.S. tobacco output could
increase substantially this year, perhaps by 8 percent over the
1989 crop of 1.4 billion pounds. However, smaller on-hand
inventories will reduce total supplies for 1990-91.

   Here is a list of jurors for the Iran-Contra
trial of John Poindexter, with information drawn from their answers
to juror questionnaires and from questioning in court before the
jury was chosen:
   _Jury foreman Wayne Maurice Mitchell, 25, handles customer
complaints for the Claims Administration Corp. of Rockville, Md.,
which makes decisions on whether to pay medical claims. One of the
few things he recalled about the Iran-Contra affair was that ``Fawn
Hall became a big star'' and that her boss, Oliver North,
``destroyed some documents'' and was appealing his convictions. He
said before the trial that he knew Poindexter was ``charged with
something'' but didn't know what. Mitchell said Poindexter looked
unfamiliar to him. He completed two years of college at the
University of Maryland.
   _Sharonda L. Ings, 20, who works at the Washington Sanitary
Commission as a data entry clerk and at night does data processing
at a supermarket. She said she'd never heard of Poindexter, did
hear about Oliver North's trial but didn't know the outcome.
   _Angela Jones, 26, a nursing assistant at Children's Hospital in
Washington. She heard that the Poindexter trial was coming up, but
didn't know what the former national security adviser was accused
of. ``Basically, I flip'' to other channels when the news comes on,
she said.
   _Barbara Myers Destry, 29, a nursing assistant who takes care of
the elderly at a nursing home, works eight to 16 hours a day and
says she has no time for television. She hadn't heard about
Poindexter and when asked about whether she had heard of Oliver
North, said, ``Not really.'' High school education. Married nine
years.
   _Hattie Lake, 62, retired, widowed and with two grown children,
said she had ``heard a little'' about former President Reagan
giving videotaped testimony for Poindexter's trial, but didn't pay
much attention because ``it really just didn't concern me.''
   _Gloria May Salmon, 45, a bridal consultant at a downtown
department store, grew up in Kingston, Jamaica. She has a son who
is a Marine. She said she could recall only that Poindexter ``was
Mr. North's boss'' but had heard that Reagan had refused to turn
over his diaries to Poindexter and that ``a video was offered
instead.''
   _Marilyn Patricia Bonner, 45, a secretary at postal service
headquarters for the past 21 years, said she had heard that North
``got rid of some papers'' and ``was supposed to be doing some
community service'' work. Asked about Poindexter, she said she had
``just heard the name.''
   _Johnny Sylvester Blakeney Jr., 49, a senior administration
specialist with International Business Machines' learning center in
Arlington, Va., and a Vietnam veteran. Said he recognized the name
of the computer system on which North and Poindexter communicated
and which was vital to prosecutors in assembling criminal cases in
the affair. Blakeney had served as a juror previously in a drug
trial and a murder trial, with guilty verdicts handed down in both
cases.
   _Gladys C. Montgomery, 46, a claims auditor for Blue Cross-Blue
Shield, where she started working in 1969. She has four children
and her husband works for the postal service. She said she pays
little attention to news because ``it's so depressing'' and that
she reads romance novels instead.
   _Leroy Witherspoon, 44, a distribution clerk for the postal
service at Dulles Airport outside Washington. Spent five years in
the Army and was a paratrooper in Vietnam. He said ``I hope I
would'' rule impartially in the Poindexter case and that ``I hope I
could'' treat former President Reagan's videotaped deposition the
same as anyone else's testimony. He said that if he had heard
Poindexter's name he ``didn't pay much attention.''
   _William L. Harris, 42, who does accounting work at the
University of the District of Columbia, said North ``helped supply
arms and ammunition to help the Contras fight the civil war down
in'' Central America and that North ``reported directly to''
Poindexter, whose name Harris had heard ``mentioned once or twice.''
   _Anna Christine Thomas, 44, is a budget development specialist
at the Department of Public Works in Washington. She has two
children in high school. Her husband is a warehouseman. She
couldn't recognize Poindexter in the courtroom.

<HEAD>Pollution Bill Advancing in Senate, House Committee</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Senate session resumes 9:15 a.m. EDT</NOTE>

   The Senate is on the verge of approving
stricter air pollution controls for the first time in a decade,
while a House committee reports progress in crafting its own
version.
   The Senate planned today to move through a remaining string of
amendments under an 8 p.m. EDT deadline for a final vote on the
pollution control package.
   The clean air bill has dominated the Senate's agenda since
January. It is the product of three weeks of closed-door
negotiations with the White House and then lengthy debate and
tradeoffs on the Senate floor and in negotiations among senators.
   Across the Capitol, the House Energy and Commerce Committee was
expected to move a step closer toward approving clean air
legislation, with a scheduled vote on a newly reached compromise
over regulating toxic air pollutants.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said he hoped
the bill would be ready for a final vote in the committee later
this week before Congress takes its Easter recess. The measure
would go to the House floor in May.
   Both the Senate and House bills represent the first toughening
of federal air pollution controls in 13 years. The federal Clean
Air Act, enacted in 1970, was last revised in 1977, although
environmentalists and many federal pollution control officials for
years have acknowledged serious shortcomings in the law.
   The bills impose new pollution controls on industry, automobiles
and electric power plants and have been estimated to cost the
economy $21 billion a year.
   The compromise reached Monday in the Energy and Commerce
Committee by Dingell and other key members of both parties involved
a provision that covers releases of toxic chemicals, including
cancer-causing substances, from industrial sources.
   As part of the agreement, the legislation would require more
than 90 percent of industrial polluters to install ``maximum
available technology'' to control toxic chemicals. The bill
originally covered only 50 percent of the polluters, exempting many
of the smaller sources.
   But in return, attempts were abandoned to require a second-stage
``health-based'' standard that has been strongly opposed by
industry.
   That so-called ``residual risk'' provision, which some committee
members had wanted, would have required industrial plants to meet
minimum cancer risk standards based on exposure to nearby residents
no matter what technological controls are being used by the
polluter. If the standard could not be met a plant would have to be
shut down.
   The decision was ``not to fight about the (residual risk) issue
now as long as we are getting the best reductions (of toxic
chemicals) up front,'' said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who has
pushed for strong toxic control provisions in the bill.
   ``It's the best we can get right now,'' added Rep. Bill
Richardson, D-N.M., who had been preparing an amendment for a
health-based requirement. ``I'm willing to forgo residual risk in
exchange for tighter, stricter standards up front.''
   Under the compromise, the Environmental Protection Agency still
would be required to assess in the year 2000 whether additional
controls are required and could impose additional standards if
there is not an ``ample margin of safety'' from cancer-causing
pollutants.

<HEAD>GAO Studies Pesticide Use on Imported Fruits, Vegetables</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some foreign fruit and vegetable producers try
to conform with U.S. bans on certain pesticides, but others often
are unaware of restrictions, according to a report to Congress.
   The General Accounting Office said Monday it found that each of
five countries checked has laws and regulations controlling
pesticide availability and use by their own producers. However,
those laws and regulations often don't mesh with U.S. standards.
   Latin American and Caribbean countries supply most of the fruits
and vegetables imported by the United States. In 1988, those
totaled 5.5 million metric tons, or 77 percent of total imports.
   The five countries checked by GAO, the investigative arm of
Congress, were Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala and
Mexico, which accounted for more than half the 1988 produce imports.
   Exporters and producers in some of the countries try to use
practices that take U.S. pesticide restrictions into consideration,
the report said. The GAO found this to be done by ``multinational
firms'' in all five countries and by other growers in Chile and
Mexico.
   ``Where U.S. requirements were not specifically considered in
selecting pesticides for use on exports _ particularly among the
less experienced growers in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and
Guatemala _ growers had not developed networks for obtaining
information on their export markets' pesticide requirements,'' the
report said.
   The GAO was asked to look into efforts being made by foreign
governments and private industries to ensure imported fresh produce
meets U.S. safety requirements.
   The report was requested by Reps. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., and
Frank Horton, R-N.Y.
   Efforts are being made in the current Uruguay Round of trade
negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to
harmonize food safety and sanitary requirements, including
pesticide residue standards.
   The GAO said the five countries, like the United States, have
not designed their food safety and quality systems to meet the
import requirements of other countries.
   However, the report said some of the countries limit the legal
availability of pesticides that are also not allowed in the United
States and ``help to increase the likelihood that exports to the
United States will not contain residues'' of those chemicals.
   ``For example, the five governments had prohibited or not
registered from 81 percent to 94 percent of 52 pesticides whose
registration (the Environmental Protection Agency) had canceled or
suspended as of Oct. 25, 1988, including 26 whose registrations had
been voluntarily canceled by manufacturers,'' the report said.
   GAO also identified 110 pesticides registered for use in one or
more of the five countries that do not have EPA tolerances
established for food use in the United States. In some cases, EPA
may not have evaluated the pesticides or may have denied a U.S.
tolerance or registration.
   ``Registering pesticides that do not have U.S. registrations or
EPA tolerances may be appropriate in a country because of its
specific pest problems, crops and climate; because the pesticides
are suitable for non-food uses; or because exporters need
alternative pesticides to be legally available to meet their export
markets' differing requirements,'' the GAO said.
   Even so, a pesticide permitted in a foreign country could result
in that country's produce being refused U.S. entry if residues are
detected by the Food and Drug Administration, the report said.

   When the Buffalo, N.Y., transit system came to
a halt, the squeal of its brakes was a familiar sound to public
transportation officials in Youngstown, Ohio, and Birmingham, Ala.
   In 1981, those two cities saw their federally subsidized bus
systems fail because they were unable to raise local taxes.
   The two systems did rise and roll again _ Youngstown got an
advance on its state funding to tide it over until the levy passed;
Birmingham was revived by a beer tax. So reports of the death of
the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority in Buffalo may be
premature.
   Yet transit experts predict that the inherent problem _ a
shortage of mass transportation funding at the federal, state and
local levels _ will recur.
   Arlee Reno, transportation director of the Urban Institute, a
Washington-based think tank, said Monday it is likely that a
solution will be found to Buffalo's problems, but fares may go up
while ridership declines.
   ``It might be a situation where everybody has to compromise more
than they want,'' Reno said.
   Buffalo ``is an example ... of a local community that is
hard-pressed to come up with the dollars necessary,'' said Charles
Bishop, spokesman for the American Public Transit Association.
``And it may indicate thatnow is not the time to be turning to
local governments for more.''
   Last month, President Bush and Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner announced a federal transportation policy that continues a
decade-long effort to shift to state and local governments the
burden of paying for mass transit.
   But deep federal cuts throughout the 1980s have left mass
transit in a state of continuous fiscal crisis, particularly in the
Northeast, Reno said.
   ``In a lot of places, we've seen deterioration of the
infrastructure and in some places, instead of that happening, we
simply run out of operating money,'' he added. ``That appears to
have happened in Buffalo.''
   Buffalo's system reached a crisis on Monday because Erie County
legislators failed to find a source of transit funding as they
agreed to more than two years ago.
   But the city's problems have been exacerbated by economic
difficulties in the region, declining population and the general
trend of shrinking ridership for large Eastern cities, Reno noted.
   The Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority faces a $15.6
million budget gap this year. The deficit is monumental compared
with those that temporarily shut down mass transit in Youngstown
and Birmingham.
   The Birmingham bus system closed in March 1981 because of rising
costs, declining ridership and a projected deficit of $800,000. At
the time, the system served 11,000 riders, making about 30,000
trips a day. But the Alabama Legislature refused to pass an
emergency funding measure and the buses stopped running.
   The system remained shut until June 1981, said Jerome C.
Beasley, general manager of the Birmingham-Jefferson Transit
Authority.
   But ``the fight is never over,'' Beasley said. ``Every two or
three years we go through these problems.''
   Beasley said a bill in the Legislature would provide $5 million
for mass transit throughout the state. ``At least that's a foot in
the door,'' he said. ``Right now, the state gives no money at all.''
   Youngstown was left without bus service in November 1981 when
voters rejected a proposed tax that would have raised about $1
million. At the time, the Western Reserve Transit Authority faced a
$1.5 million deficit. It served 5,000 daily riders, including 2,900
public school students.
   The Ohio city got a reprieve when the governor stepped in and
advanced the authority its 1982 state funding, said Jim Ferraro,
agency executive director. That enabled the bus system to reopen in
a month and run until a two-mill property tax assessment was
passed, he said.
   But the assessment has to be periodically reauthorized, and it
doesn't always pass on the first try, Ferraro said.
   In addition, he said, the amount of the assessment has dropped
as property values plummeted and its value declined as the cost of
living rose.

<HEAD>Students Know Little About History, Civics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new survey suggests only 38 percent of
eighth graders know Congress makes laws, more than half don't know
the meaning of separation of powers and barely half know the United
States is a representative democracy.
   Ina V.S. Mullis of the Educational Testing Service outlined
those and other examples Monday to show the significant gaps in
knowledge American students have in history and civics.
   Ms. Mullis helped conduct the first surveys of achievement in
history and civics at grades four, eight and 12 for the National
Assessment of Educational Progress, popularly known as the Nation's
Report Card.
   The key result of the 1988 assessments, which coincided with the
bicentennial of the writing of the U.S. Constitution, was that
American students have basic facts and skills in history and civics
but cannot apply what they've learned to draw conclusions and
demonstrate understanding.
   ``The assessment seems to show a Trivial Pursuit sort of
familiarity with some of the key figures and dramatic events of our
past, but even on this level the gaps are wide,'' said Richard
Riley, former governor of South Carolina and a member of the
assessment governing board.
   Mary Frances Berry, a history professor at the University of
Pennsylvania and member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, said
the assessment ``gives us fresh evidence for despair.''
   ``If ... the report is accurate, our high school graduates, on
the whole, lack the kind of understanding of the nation's heritage
that is necessary to be an informed citizen in a democracy,'' she
said.
   Key findings were:
   _Most fourth graders knew why Thanksgiving and July 4 are
celebrated, but only 36 percent knew why Columbus sailed to America.
   _More than three-fourths of eighth graders could identify the
Rev. Martin Luther King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech, but fewer than
half knew he advocated nonviolence.
   _In both 1986 and 1988, 11th graders correctly answered only 55
percent of history questions. Scores improved, however, on
questions about exploration and colonization, and the rise of
modern America and World War I.
   _Nearly one-third of eighth graders and almost half the high
school seniors didn't recognize the presidential veto,
congressional veto override and Supreme Court decisions as examples
of the federal system of checks and balances.
   The ETS evaluated the history achievement of 16,000 students and
the civics achievement of 11,000 other students. The tests were
graded on a scale of 0 to 500.
   Ms. Mullis said there was a vast gap between the performance of
students attending schools in rich and poor urban neighborhoods.
   For example, about two-thirds of the eighth graders performed at
or above level 250, which reflected knowledge of a variety of
historical figures, events and terms.
   However, although 80 percent of the eighth graders from
higher-income neighborhoods attained that level, fewer than half
the disadvantaged eighth graders did.

<HEAD>Reports Of Child Abuse Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reports of child abuse and neglect rose 9
percent last year, the largest increase since 1985, says the
National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse.
   The survey released Monday found that 2.4 million reports of
child abuse and neglect were recorded in 1989 by state child
welfare agencies, including at least 1,237 child abuse-abuse
related deaths.
   Ann Cohn, executive director of the abuse prevention committee,
said the growing problem of drug and alcohol abuse figures
prominently the increase, along with social problems such as
poverty and homelessness.
   But she said some of the increase was due to state changes in
the definitions of child abuse and in their reporting systems.
   The 2.4 million reports last year compared with 2.2 million in
1988.
   Most of the abuse occurs in the home, according to the survey.
   The group also concluded, based on a nationwide telephone
survey, that fewer parents are disciplining their children with
insults, swearing or spankings.
   The telephone poll of 460 randomly selected parents found that
the proportion who said they had not used swearing or insults as
discipline in the previous year rose from 45 percent in 1988 to 60
percent this year.
   It also found that those who said they never spanked or hit
their children grew from 36 percent in 1988 to 49 percent this year.
   The proportion who said they often swore or used insults to
discipline their children went from 2 percent in 1988 to 3 percent
this year, and the group that said they often hit their children
went from 4 percent to 5 percent.
   The survey, conducted by Schumlan, Ronca and Bucuvalas Inc. of
New York, has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage
points.

   There are signs President Fernando
Collor de Mello's draconian economic measures are throwing the
economy into recession, and Brazilians are desperately trying to
weather the storm.
   Industrial production dropped 20 percent from February to March,
private economists say, and the automobile and contruction
industries are virtually paralyzed. Unions say 200,000 workers have
lost their jobs.
   ``A recession is now inevitable. What we must avoid is a
depression,'' said Rep. Jose Serra of the center-left Brazilian
Social Democratic Party.
   Collor de Mello passed the measures by decree on March 16, the
day after he took office as the country's first popularly elected
president in 29 years.
   They became law immediately but can be voted down by Congress
within 30 days. Legislators were to begin voting on the plan Monday
but failed to obtain a quorum. Congressional leaders said they
would try again today.
   The economic measures, designed to halt record 4,000 annual
inflation, includes a 30-day price freeze, a new national currency
and drastic government spending cuts.
   The package also contains an 18-month freeze on assets of more
than $1,200 in private savings accounts and $600 in money market
funds.
   The freeze withdrew about $115 billion from circulation, or 80
percent of bank deposits, and led to a brutal drop in consumer
spending.
   Restaurants, movie theaters and shops have seen a radical drop
in business.
   ``I haven't gone out to eat or to a bar since the plan was
announced. I've cut out all expenses that aren't absolutely
necessary,'' said Saulo de Oliveira, a 36-year-old businessmen.
   Even Rio's illegal but widely tolerated numbers racket known as
the ``Animal Game,'' has reported a drop of 50 percent in receipts.
The game, conducted on street corners, is popular among Brazil's
working class.
   While early opinion polls showed as much as 87 percent of the
public backed the plan, in recent days grumbling has increased,
especially from those who saw their money confiscated.
   ``For the love of God, liberate my miserable money,'' Brasilia
housewife Maria Laila reportedly wrote to Economic Minister Zelia
Cardoso de Mello.
   On the other end of the spectrum, Antonio Ermirio de Moraes, one
of Brazil's leading businessmen, saw $500 million caught in the
bank freeze. An obviously distraught de Moraes recently told a TV
talk show host he had considered leaving the country to start life
anew overseas.
   A joke now making the rounds is that Collor's measures have made
businessmen sleep like babies: ``One hour of sleep and two hours of
crying, one hour of sleep and two hours of crying...''
   Because of the freeze on accounts, businesses are having a hard
time paying March salaries. Subsidiaries of some foreign companies
such as General Motors and Nestle had to borrow money from banks to
pay workers.
   But many observers say that if companies don't pay their workers
soon strikes will break out.
   ``We'll invade the banks if money (for salaries) is not freed,''
said Vicente Paula da Silva, president of the Sao Paulo
Metalworkers Union.
   ``It won't help because the banks don't have money,'' replied
Leo Cochrane Jr., head of the Brazilian Banking Federation.
   But while much of Brazil struggles to stay afloat, one sector on
the upswing is the spiritual.
   The Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper reported city churches have
seen especially heavy traffic the past several weeks. Worshippers
have packed the Church of Saint Judas Tadeu _ the patron saint of
lost causes.
   ``Everyone from shantytown residents to big businesmen don't
believe in anything anymore and are seeking the protection of the
saint,'' Rev. Odilo Hoepers told the newspaper.

   Low-income residents of federally subsidized

facing possible rent increases because of the additional income.
   Jack Kemp, secretary of the department of Housing and Urban

jobs because it ``will help residents of rent subsidized housing
earn extra income and will also help the Census Bureau secure a

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Reach One-Year Agreement on Drift-Net Fishing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Japanese negotiators have agreed to
triple the number of observers on Japanese drift-net boats and
equip all the vessels with monitoring transmitters.
   However, critics of the one-year agreement announced Monday by
the State Department said it would provide observers for only 10
percent of Japan's drift-net vessels and allow the Japanese to
continue to fish the cold, salmon-rich waters south of the Aleutian
Islands.
   The pact calls for 98 vessels from Japan's squid and large-mesh
drift-net fleets to be monitored in the 1990 fishing season by 47
U.S., 41 Japanese and 10 Canadian observers. Last year, 32 Japanese
drift-net vessels were covered by observers.
   The monitoring transmitters will send signals to satellites,
enabling the government to tell when the vessels enter waters where
drift-netting is illegal. Critics of drift-netting say the
miles-long nets illegally capture North America-spawned salmon and
kill thousands of marine birds and mammals.

<HEAD>Ex-Police Chief Running for Mayor's Job</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former District of Columbia Police Chief
Maurice T. Turner is running for mayor of the nation's capital _ as
a Republican in a city where Democratic voters outnumber
Republicans nine-to-one.
   ``We need leaders who serve for the public good, not personal
gratification,'' Turner said Monday in making his formal
announcement of candidacy. ``We need leaders who surround
themselves with people of integrity, not people who merely want a
city contract.''
   Turner, a policeman for 32 years and chief for the last eight,
said improving the school system and fighting drugs and crime would
be the top priorities of his administration.
   Turner, 54, switched to the Republican Party last July, fueling
speculation that he intended to run for mayor. He is the only

   After wild ups and downs, share prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange ended sharply higher Tuesday, while the dollar
closed lower against the Japanese yen.
   The bellwether Nikkei Stock Average of 225 issues regained
757.65 points, or 2.7 percent, ending the day at 28,757.65. The
index briefly lost more than 200 points during morning trading.
   The Nikkei had dropped 1,978.38 points, or 6.59 percent, to
28,002.07 on Monday in a plunge second only to the Oct. 20, 1987,
drop that followed Wall Street's ``Black Monday'' crash.
   The dollar closed Tuesday at 158.95, down 1.00 yen from Monday's
close. It had opened at 159.10 yen and ranged between 158.80 yen
and 159.35 yen.
   Share prices rose back in the afternoon as market players
decided that the market had bottomed out in the morning, when the
index fell below the 28,000-point mark, said Yoshiro Inoue, an
analyst with Nomura Securities Co.
   Dealers expect that the index will fall no lower than 27,200
points, 30 percent lower than where it ended trading last year.
   In currency dealings, the dollar was moving narrowly Tuesday
morning following Monday's leap. It closed at 158.65 yen in New
York overnight, up from 158.35 yen on Friday.
   Chizuko Satsukawa, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said a
majority of currency players were making position adjustments,
avoiding major moves due to uncertainties over the stock market.
   ``Instability in the stock market has made foreign exchange
investors feel they are being thrown about,'' she added.
   Ms. Satsukawa said the yen edged up earlier as investment trust
banks bought a substantial amount of dollars, reassured by the
initial rise in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said, however, that the market's
demand for the dollar remains strong, and participants were
inclined to buy the currency whenever it made a downward movement.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he is very concerned
with recent market movements, and that he hopes stability returns
to the market soon.

<DATELINE>MONTELIMAR, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outgoing President Daniel Ortega
says a two-day summit with four other Central American leaders in
this new beach resort will bring good news for regional peace.
   The top item on the agenda was demobilizing the U.S.-backed
Contras, who have waged a 10-year war against Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinistas, who were voted out of office in February.
   As the meeting began Monday, President Rafael Leonardo Callejas
of Honduras said the Contra's top military commander had agreed to
disband the forces before Nicaragua's new government takes office
on April 25.
   In another development, leftist Salvadoran guerrillas and that
country's rightist government agreed to meet Wednesday in Geneva to
renew talks under the mediation of U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar.
   Ortega said talks at the first session ``were wide-ranging and
very good. There was ample discussion about the demobilization of
the Contras and the democratization of El Salvador and Guatemala.''
He refused to go into details.
   ``I believe that tomorrow we will have an excellent declaration
to make to the peoples of Central America, who want peace,'' Ortega
said.
   Also at the summit were Presidents Alfredo Cristiani of El
Salvador, Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and Oscar Arias of Costa Rica.
   Arias won the Nobel Peace prize in 1987 for working out the
first of a series of Central American peace accords aimed at ending
civil wars in the region. He will leave office on May 8, turning
over the presidency of Central America's most stable democracy to
Rafael Angel Calderon. He was barred by his country's constitution
from running for re-election in the February vote.
   On Monday, Arias mirrored Ortega's enthusiasm: ``I am very
optimistic we will have a magnificent declaration to make that will
benefit the peoples of the region.''
   A point of deadlock has been the demobilization of the Contras
inside Nicaragua and in base camps in neighboring Honduras before
Ortega turns over power to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   Ortega has indicated reluctance to hand over the military and
police while the rebels are still active.
   In an accord March 23 with representatives of Mrs. Chamorro, a
Contra commander agreed to demobilize. But deep divisions remain in
the rebel ranks, with many rank-and-file fighters saying they won't
lay down their arms soon.
   But Callejas said top rebel commander Israel Galeano, also known
as Commander Franklyn, had assured him the Contras would disband by
the time Chamorro is sworn in.
   There have been doubts about the viability of the March accord
because Galeano did not sign it and thousands of Contras have since
returned from Honduras to Nicaragua with their guns.
   A Contra spokesman in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital,
announced late Monday that the rebels inside Honduras would
surrender their weapons April 18 to a U.N. peacekeeping force at
the border town of Yamales.
   Those inside Nicaragua are expected to gather in previously
determined ``security zones'' and do the same around that date.
   In an open letter to the summit, Salvadoran guerrillas proposed
a plebiscite on constitutional reform to reduce the armed forces,
purge the military of right-wing elements and subject it to
civilian authority.
   The letter proposed the plebiscite be held jointly with the 1991
elections for a new National Assembly. It also proposed the
60-member legislature be expanded and the elections and plebiscite
be held without any military presence, and monitored by
international observers.
   The letter said that, if an agreement is reached, the rebels
will turn into peaceful political parties.
   ``The letter has positive aspects that we should take into
account. All this will be discussed by our representatives with
those of the front in Geneva,'' Cristiani said.
   The last peace talks on ending El Salvador's decade-old civil
war _ which has claimed 72,000 lives _ were suspended in November.

<HEAD>Two Executed For Selling Panda Skins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Sichuan farmers lost court appeals and were
executed for selling the skins of giant pandas, a newspaper
reported today.
   Liang Yongzheng and He Guanghai, from Pingwu County in the
southwest Chinese province, were sentenced to death in October for
dealing in the endangered species.
   The Legal Daily said the two were executed on Monday after
losing appeals in the Sichuan provincial court and the Supreme
Court.
   It said Liang bought a panda skin in January 1987 for 4,500 yuan
($957) and together with an accomplice sold it in Canton for 80,000
yuan ($17,000).
   He was caught later that year when he bought three more pelts
for 7,000 yuan ($1,500) and tried to sell them for 280,000 yuan
($59,600).
   He Guanghai was involved in similar transactions in southeastern
Guangdong province, where Canton is located, and coastal Fujian
province.
   Two of Liang's accomplices were previously sentenced to life in
prison.
   Only about 1,000 giant pandas still survive in the wilds of
Sichuan and neighboring Tibet. The Chinese government has forbidden
hunting of the species, and Sichuan courts have dealt out harsh
punishments to people caught killing or selling the animals.
   Executions in China are usually carried out with a bullet to the
back of the head.

<HEAD>McDonald's, City Argue Over Weight Labeling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   McDonald's, which years ago was challenged
on the weight of its Quarter-Pounder, is facing a dressing-down for
the way it sells salad.
   The city wants McDonald's to tell customers how much their
salads weigh.
   ``It's as ridiculous as it sounds,'' McDonald's lawyer, Arthur
Makadon, said Monday. ``It's a question of bureaucracy taking
consumerism way beyond anything that was intended by policy or
law.''
   This weighty matter has reached the courts as the city tries to
enforce Pennsylvania's Weights and Measures Act of 1965.
   ``The city requires of any food vendor that sells food in a
package that it inform the customer what the customer is paying
for,'' said Andrew P. Bralow, chief deputy of the city solicitor's
enforcement division.
   That just toasts McDonald's croutons.
   ``It's in a transparent container _ you see what you're
getting,'' Makadon said.
   But the city thinks this is a good time, great case to prove its
point that the containers must be marked by weight.
   Last week, Common Pleas Judge Nicholas M. D'Alessandro ruled
that McDonald's must post the weights on its menu board.
McDonald's, refusing to wilt, asked him to reconsider.
   ``We're saying, first, the law doesn't apply to restaurants,''
Makadon said. ``Secondly, it does not apply where you customarily
buy something by count _ one salad or two salads.''
   When McDonald's introduced its Quarter-Pounder in the 1970s,
someone pointed out that it didn't weigh a quarter pound when
served. McDonald's now notes that the burger weighs a quarter pound
before cooking.
   The state has issued similar warnings to McDonald's, Wendy's and
Burger King restaurants in Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton.
   ``We haven't pursued them further until we get a precedent in
the Philadelphia case,'' said Fred Yahner, director of the state
Weights and Measures Bureau.
   ``One of the basic rules of weights and measures is that
products like these should be sold by weight. We can't make
exceptions.''

   A judge ruled Attorney General John Van de
Kamp may use San Francisco Chronicle articles in a TV commercial
for his gubernatorial campaign despite the paper's objection that
such use implied an endorsement.
   U.S. District Judge John Vukasin on Monday denied a Chronicle
request to bar use of the newspaper's name in the commercial.
   ``I suspect it (the ad) comes dangerously close to creating a
false impression that that is the Chronicle speaking,'' Vukasian
said.
   But he said the Van de Kamp campaign properly identified itself
as the sponsor of the commercial and was clearly quoting the
Chronicle as a source of information.
   Neil Shapiro, a lawyer for the Chronicle, said the newspaper
still may sue for damages.
   The ad, first shown two weeks ago, attacks former San Francisco
Mayor Dianne Feinstein, Van de Kamp's rival for the Democratic
nomination, over her management of the city. Each subject is
illustrated by a Chronicle clipping about a controversy. The
paper's name appears several times at the bottom of the screen.
   The Chronicle sued last week to stop the use of its name and
masthead, saying the ad violated the newspaper's trademark and was
meant to mislead.
   ``If we wish to endorse someone we will, but we don't want
somebody stealing the endorsement,'' Shapiro told the judge.
   Saying some angry readers had telephoned the paper to complain
about its apparent endorsement, the lawyer declared that the ad
``confuses people into believing the Chronicle supports, endorses
or even prepared'' it.
   But Kantor said Van de Kamp had an obligation, as well as a
constitutional right, to quote the Chronicle as the source of
material in his commercial.
   He also said the ad would be protected by freedom of speech even
if it was misleading.
   Vukasin did not mention constitutional protections in his
ruling, saying only the ad properly identified its sponsorship.
   Mickey Kantor, a lawyer for Van de Kamp, said the commercial's
run was due to end Monday.

<HEAD>U.S. Says American Linked to Coup Plot Was Not Involved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OLIVER TEVES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy said today an
American linked in testimony to the December coup attempt works for
the U.S. Air Force but denies involvement in the bid to topple
President Corazon Aquino.
   Brig. Gen. Alejandro Galido, who the government says infiltrated
the coup plotters' ranks, told investigators that Harold Maglio of
Wrightwood City, Calif., offered to sell weapons to Mrs. Aquino's
opponents a year ago.
   Galido says Maglio had identified himself as a U.S. Air Force
colonel assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency.
   In a statement today, the embassy said Maglio was a civilian
quality assurance manager at Norton Air Force Base near San
Bernadino, Calif., and that he met with Galido during a private
visit here last year.
   ``Mr. Maglio has never had any connection with the Defense
Intelligence Agency, nor was he ever a colonel in the U.S. Air
Force,'' the statement said.
   ``He has no responsibility for policy, intelligence or political
matters within the U.S. government and his work does not involve
the Philippines,'' the embassy said.
   After the statement was released, Presidential Press Secretary
Tomas Gomez said he would not rule out the possibility that Maglio
was an American agent but said he believed the American was
``either a fake or a con man.''
   ``I am not discounting that,'' Gomez said. ``But it is easier to
believe that he is just a `con man' taking advantage of the
situation. We are not giving importance to that issue.''
   In its statement, the embassy said U.S. law enforcement agencies
investigated Maglio at the request of Filipino authorities and
``there was no indication Mr. Maglio was actively involved in any
coup planning or otherwise seeking to destabilize the Philippine
government.''
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa told reporters
today the government was aware of Maglio's activities. De Villa
stood by Galido's statement and said it was up to ``our civilian
superiors'' to decide whether to take legal action against Maglio.
   The government has claimed Galido was a ``deep penetration
agent'' who infiltrated ranks of military dissidents who launched a
nine-day coup attempt Dec. 1 in which at least 113 people were
killed and 600 wounded.
   In testimony given Jan. 23 and released by the Department of
Justice last month, Galido said Maglio offered weapons in return
for $20 million. There was no indication the deal was completed.
   ``We were able to talk with an American introduced to me as Col.
Harold Maglio, U.S. Air Force, who claimed to be a member of the
United States Defense Intelligence Agency,'' Galido said.
   Galido quoted Maglio as saying he was the DIA's representative
in the Philippines and ``favors the overthrow of the Aquino
government.''
   According to Galido, Maglio claimed links to U.S. Ambassador
Nicholas Platt and offered to telephone the embassy to authenticate
his claims. Platt denies knowing Maglio.
   Galido quoted Maglio as saying ``that their group can promise to
deliver to our forces, if we move against the government, shipments
of firearms, ammunition, anti-tank missiles, anti-helicopter
missiles and other armaments we will need for the government
takeover.''
   U.S. jets flew air cover for government forces during the coup
attempt. Embassy spokeswoman Victoria Middleton said U.S. officials
were cooperating with Filipino authorities in the Maglio affair.
   Galido's testimony has led to charges that Washington secretly
supported the December coup attempt and then double-crossed the
mutineers to make the government beholden to the Americans.
   ``The United States government does not support any activity
aimed at destabilizing the Philippine government,'' the embassy
said. ``Any representation that there is such official support is
false.''
   Last week, the majority leader of the Philippine Senate,
Teofisto Guingona, urged the United States to make a full
disclosure about Maglio before talks begin on extending the lease
on six U.S. military bases in the Philippines.
   The lease expires in September 1991, and the talks are expected
to begin next month.

   Supervisors and outside workers filled in
today for 11,000 striking employees at Southern California
hospitals and medical offices run by Kaiser Permanente, the
nation's No. 1 health maintenance organization.
   ``There's no large crisis; things have gone pretty much as
planned,'' said Jack Davis, director of Kaiser's regional hospital
services.
   The 2-day-old walkout by nurses, technicians and maintenance
workers affected seven hospitals and more than 40 offices in Los
Angeles and Orange counties. But Kaiser officials said they were
prepared for the strike.
   Supervisors and workers from unaffected Kaiser facilities worked
many jobs held by the strikers, several clinics closed, services
were cut and about 150 Kaiser patients or more were transferred to
other hospitals, the HMO said.
   Kaiser, a nonprofit medical institute, has more than 2.2 million
subscribers in Southern California. They pay a fee for
comprehensive care rather than the traditional pay-per-visit
system. It is the nation's biggest HMO.
   More than 100 workers quietly walked the picket lines at
Kaiser's Anaheim hospital on Monday. The other affected hospitals
are in Los Angeles, West Los Angeles, Panorama City, Woodland
Hills, Harbor City and Bellflower.
   ``Most of us here have ourselves and families to support. It's
hard on both sides,'' said Joyce Johnston, a licensed vocational
nurse.
   Workers defied a union negotiating team's recommendation and
rejected a contract offer Friday by a 3,067-to-1,474 vote. A
six-hour negotiating session with a mediator ended Saturday without
agreement, and the strike began Monday.
   The company offered a 5 percent to 6 percent raise the first
year and a 3 percent to 5 percent raise the second and third years.
The offer also guarantees wages 3 percent higher than the average
at 12 Los Angeles-area hospitals.
   Top pay for a licensed vocational nurse under the old contract
was $13.01 per hour, according to Kaiser.
   The union refused to outline its demands. ``Management knows
what it will take to settle the strike,'' said union Vice President
Dave Stilwell.
   Kaiser employees accepted a wage freeze three years ago, stood
by the company during nine years of financial difficulty and
deserve more ``now that Kaiser is back on their feet and
prospering,'' said union spokesman Tom Ramsay.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Nevada-Las Vegas routed Duke
University 103-73 to win its first NCAA basketball crown by the
biggest margin in a championship game.
   ``It was one of those games you dream about,'' UNLV coach Jerry
Tarkanian said Monday.
   The Runnin' Rebels became the first team to score more than 100
points in the championship; the first team ranked No. 1 in the
preseason to win the title since 1982, and the first Western team
to win since UCLA in 1975.
   The Rebels literally stole the title from Duke, breaking the
tournament record for steals in a game with 16. Until Monday, the
largest margin of victory in a championship was 23 points, when
UCLA beat North Carolina 78-55 in 1968.
   ``We lost to the best team in the country playing at their
best,'' Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. Duke has made the NCAA
tournament's Final Four eight times without a title.
   For Tarkanian, getting the trophy capped a 15-year battle with
the NCAA, which ordered the school to suspend him for recruiting
violations. He went to court for an injunction and the case
eventually reached the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the
NCAA but said only the university could discipline him.
   ``You can call us bad. You can call us thugs. You can call us
hoodlums. But at the end of that, please, call us national
champions, too,'' said Larry Johnson, the school's top scorer and
rebounder this season.

   U.S.-based journalists at the news agency
Reuters are withholding their bylines from stories to protest
management contract proposals.
   The byline strike begun Monday will last three days, said the
Newspaper Guild, which represents about 500 Reuters employees
around the country, including 150 journalists. Their contract
expired Feb. 28.
   ``We hope this action will impress management with our anger
that a company making so much money wants to severely cut the
benefits and pay of those who are crucial to Reuters' success,''
said Barry Lipton, president of the Guild local.
   Lipton said the company's offer of a 2.5 percent raise would be
offset by a proposed weekly increase of work time from 33.75 hours
to 37.5 hours, with no overtime until after 40 hours.
   The company has also proposed having employees pay for part of
the cost of health insurance.
   Reuters, in a statement, cited the rising cost of health care
and said the company's benefits ``will remain competitive by all
industry standards.''

   A guide who helped lead a deadly climb of
Mount Hood said the expedition likely would have ended safely if
only it had been abandoned sooner in the face of a gathering storm.
   Ralph Summers testified Monday in a lawsuit brought by Richard
Haeder, whose 16-year-old son was one of nine people to die in a
blizzard during the Oregon Episcopal School trek in May 1986.
   Haeder has sued the Oregon Episcopal School and Summers, a
part-time assistant, for at least 860,000 in damages. He alleged
negligence in the planning and carrying out of the climb that led
to the freezing deaths of seven students and two adults.
   Summers, 34, said all of the group members probably would have
survived had they stopped climbing and turned around at the
Hogsback area near the summit of the 11,237-foot peak, the
second-most climbed mountain in the world behind Mount Fuji.
   Instead, the group of climbers continued its efforts to reach
the summit in deteriorating weather and by the time it turned
around a powerful snowstorm was lashing the mountain, he testified.
   ``The weather was worse on the descent,'' Summers testified.
``The wind was much stronger. It was easy to fall over and not know
if it was because of the terrain or the wind.''
   The Rev. Thomas Goman was leading the climb, but Summers said he
takes responsibility for all of the major decisions on the
expedition. He said he and Goman had an agreement that if the two
differed on a question they would follow the more conservative
approach.
   Summers said that as the group continued its descent, the storm
grew worse and he and Goman decided to build a snow cave to wait
out the blizzard.
   ``There was a crevasse on one side, a drop off on another, it
was dusk and you couldn't navigate,'' he said. ``The decision to
dig in was pretty easy.''
   The 13-member party crawled into the snow cave and spent a
harrowing night, marked by panic among people who feared they would
suffocate, Molly Schula, 21, one of the survivors of the climb,
testified Monday in Multnomah County Circuit Court.
   ``Everybody was panicking about air,'' Schula said.
   Another survivor, Brinton Clark, 19, testified that as the
opening of the cave grew narrower as snow built up throughout the
night, many of those inside became convinced they would die.
   The next morning, Summers decided to get help and Schula
volunteered to accompany him.
   She said she owes her life to Summers.
   ``I said I'll go if you'll take me,'' she said. ``I couldn't
have made it down without him.''
   They made it to safety but the cave wasn't marked and Summers
couldn't find it again once he reached help.
   It took rescuers three days to find the cave. By then, all
inside were dead except for Clark and fellow Oregon Episcopal
School student Giles Thompson.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greeks will vote again Sunday, for the
third time in a year, in hopes of breaking a political deadlock
that has created compromise governments unable to confront an
economy in crisis and growing terrorism.
   Pollsters predict the election will end like those in June and
November 1989, with no party winning enough seats to control the
government.
   Coalitions formed after last year's elections took no effective
action on foreign, domestic or economic policy. The European
Community has said Greece is in danger of bankruptcy and the EC
will not bail it out because Greece violated austerity requirements
of a 1985 loan.
   Some Greek officials and economists fear the nation may have to
surrender some of its economic sovereignty and seek help for the
first time from the International Monetary Fund.
   ``Without a strong government, we are heading for economic
disaster,'' said Stelios Argyros, president of the Federation of
Greek Industries. He said Greece needs a government that can make
the ``unpopular decisions'' required.
   The political stalemate began after 15 years of stable
government, which followed seven years of military dictatorship
that ended in 1974.
   In June 1989, the conservative New Democracy party and
Communists united to oust Premier Andreas Papandreou's Socialists
from eight years in power.
   A brief coalition of the unlikely allies presided over the
indictments of Papandreou and several of his ministers on
corruption charges stemming from banking and wiretapping scandals.
No trial dates have been set.
   Another coalition formed after the November election was unable
to stem a resurgence of terrorism, end labor unrest or resolve the
problems of rising tensions with Turkey and Albania, rivals of long
standing.
   Neither coalition was willing to negotiate a new military bases
agreement with the United States or answer the U.S. extradition
request for Mohammed Rashid, a Palestinian wanted for the 1982
bombing of a Pan Am jetliner that killed one person.
   Washington later simplified the bases problem by deciding to
close two of the four.
   Recent acts of terror have included firebombings by anarchists
and political killings and bombings by established terror groups.
   Today, at least five bombs exploded in Athens and Salonica,
ripping through a government building as well as the offices of
business groups and labor unions. Police said no injuries were
reported and that anonymous callers claimed responsibility on
behalf of two urban guerrilla groups.
   November 17th, a leftist group, claimed responsibility for the
September murder of conservative lawmaker Pavlos Bakonvannis,
son-in-law of New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis.
   Social Resistance claimed responsibility for bombings last week
that destroyed cars of foreign diplomats but caused no injuries.
   The coalition government of New Democracy, Communists and
Socialists collapsed in February because of traditional hostilities
among them.
   Some political scientists, citing generally low turnouts at
rallies, say voters appear indifferent to the current campaign.
   ``Voters are apathetic now because they think politicians are
incapable,'' said one, Dimitrios Katsoudas, director of studies at
the Center for Political Research and Information. ``They have lost
faith in the values of parties and how the political system works.''
   Miltiades Evert, a conservative former finance minister, said
Greece must make headway on its economic problems by the fall or
turn for help to the International Monetary Fund, which often
demands austerity in exchange for its aid.
   ``We won't have a Greek government, we'll have a foreign
government,'' he said in an interview. ``The administration will be
an executive arm of the IMF.''
   Inflation is the European Community' highest, 14.8 percent last
year and expected to reach 17 percent in 1990. This year's budget
deficit is expected to be 2.5 trillion drachmas ($15.6 billion).
   Mihalis Hadzipavlou, director in Athens for the international
accounting firm of Touche Ross, said foreign investors ``have not
rejected Greece outright'' but are slowing investments because of
the uncertainty.
   Zenophon Zolotas, the caretaker premier, has said Greece needs
strong, clear leadership to restore investor confidence.
   ``If a climate of certainty, confidence and above all
credibility is created, then we could be rid of the nightmare in
1991,'' he said.

   Moviegoers shelled out $25.4 million for
``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' in the biggest spring opening in
Hollywood history.
   The live-action film about pizza-loving amphibians who live in a
sewer scored an extra impressive opening over the weekend because
most of the ticket buyers were kids paying $2.50 to $3 each,
compared with $5.50 to $6.50 for adult tickets.
   ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' based on the heroes of
cartoons and video games, fell behind only ``Batman'' and
``Ghostbuster II'' for the biggest box office take in a film's
first three days, Exhibitor Relations Co. reported Monday. Both
were early summer releases.
   Moviegoers, meanwhile, were still smiling on ``Pretty Woman,''
the story of a woman transformed by a businessman from a Hollywood
Boulevard prostitute into a Rodeo Drive shopper.
   Starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, the film finished
second and collected $12.5 million at the box office.
   ``The Hunt for Red October'' descended to third place as the
underwater thriller grossed $6.5 million to bring its total take to
$76.6 million.
   Winning the best picture and best actress Oscars on March 26
helped ``Driving Miss Daisy'' climb 41 percent to land in fourth
with a gross of $5.2 million. The film, made for $8.5 million,
should pass $100 million by month's end.
   ``My Left Foot,'' which picked up Oscars for best actor and best
supporting actress, jumped 90 percent from a week ago. It finished
ninth with $1.52 million.
   Italy's ``Cinema Paradiso,'' which won best foreign language
film, made $344,000, up 86 percent.
   The comedy ``Opportunity Knocks'' starring Dana Carvey of
``Saturday Night Live,'' came in fifth with $3.5 million in its
debut weekend.
   Here are the top 10 movie ticket sales with distributor, weekend
gross, number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross
and number of weeks in release.
   1. ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' New Line, $25.4 million,

<HEAD>Jiang Zemin Named To Top Military Post</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin was named to a
top military post today, giving him one more rung in his tenuous
climb to power.
   The National People's Congress, as expected, picked Jiang as new
chairman of the state Central Military Commission, replacing senior
leader Deng Xiaoping. The Congress, China's parliament, last week
accepted Deng's resignation from his last official government post.
   Jiang, the only candidate, received 2,682 votes in his favor and
10 votes against him. There were 26 abstentions. One deputy wrote
in Deng's name and another entered the name of President Yang
Shangkun, a general with a strong following in the military.
   Jiang, Deng's hand-picked successor, in November succeeded Deng
as head of the party Central Military Commission, a key
policy-making body with nearly the same membership as the state
group.
   The military has played an increasingly important political role
in China since it was called in to crush the pro-democracy movement
in Beijing last June, and Jiang's appointment to the two posts is
crucial to his staying power as a leader.
   Jiang, a relatively unknown party boss in Shanghai, was named to
head the 48-million-member Communist Party last June after Zhao
Ziyang was purged for allegedly supporting the pro-democracy
movement.
   Jiang, 63, has no political power base in Beijing and since June
has loyally supported the hard-line policies espoused by retired
but still-powerful party elders such as Deng.
   Deng, 85, still regarded as China's most powerful man, has
declared that Jiang is the ``core'' of next-generation leaders, and
has asked the military to give him their full support.
   Jiang has no experience in military affairs, and the People's
Liberation Army remains dominated by old revolutionaries such as
President Yang, 82, a general who last November was named first
vice chairman of the party Central Military Commission.
   During the vote-counting today in the Great Hall of the People,
a crowd of deputies gathered around Hu Qili, former member of the
party Politburo Standing Committee purged along with Zhao last June
for his pro-student leanings.
   Deputies extended warm greetings to Hu, asking for his signature
and posing for pictures with him.
   Hu, like Zhao, was stripped of all party posts in June, but
escaped official criticism and on a few occasions has been allowed
to attend public functions.
   Zhao, still a party member and a deputy to the congress, has not
been seen since he went to Tiananmen Square on May 19 for a tearful
meeting with student hunger strikers.

   At least five bombs exploded in two
cities today, ripping through a government building and the offices
of business groups and labor unions. Police said no injuries were
reported.
   The early morning blasts went off simultaneously in Salonica and
Athens, the capital. Police said anonymous callers claimed
responsibility on behalf of the leftist guerrilla groups May 1 and
the Revolutionary Popular Struggle.
   The groups have asked voters to boycott Sunday's crucial
parliamentary elections, citing ``political mockery'' by the
leading parties, the Conservatives and the Socialists.
   The Salonica blasts caused extensive damage at the European
Community's northern Greece information center, located on the 6th
floor of an office building, and the Industrialists Association of
Northern Greece, police said.
   In Athens, bombs caused minor damage at the National Economy
ministry, and buildings housing the General Confederation of Greek
Trade Unions and the Federation of Greek Industrialists, they said
on condition of anonymity.
   In the past, the attacks of the terrorist groups have focused on
economic targets and none has ever caused fatalities. Both groups
say they oppose capitalism, imperialism and the U.S. military
presence in Greece.
   Greeks vote Sunday for the third time in a year, hoping to break
a political deadlock that has created compromise governments unable
to confront an economy in crisis and growing terrorism.
   But pollsters predict the election will end like those in June
and November 1989, with no party winning enough seats to control
the government.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Arrest Warrant Was Outstanding For Happy Land Owner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arrest warrant was issued last year for the
owner of the building that housed a club where 87 people died by
fire, but he never was arrested, city records show.
   A Bronx criminal judge issued the warrant after the owner, Alex
DiLorenzo III, failed to appear for a hearing on fire code
violations at the illegal social club, The New York Times reported
in today's editions.
   The warrant for DiLorenzo, who is an heir to one of the city's
largest real estate fortunes, was low priority and never was
enforced, police said.
   ``We are interested in all warrants,'' said Lt. Raymond
O'Donnell, a police spokesman. ``But we are more interested in
going after the guy who has committed a murder over a guy who has
violations in a building.''
   Of 100,000 yearly arrest warrants, those for building code
violations are among the lowest priority, O'Donnell said.
   The warrant for DiLorenzo was issued Feb. 3, 1989, by Bronx
Criminal Court Judge James E. Robinson. The violations listed in
the warrant carried a fine of up to $5,000 and 90 days in jail.
   The club lacked adequate sprinklers, emergency lighting and an
assembly permit for the entertainment of more than 75 people.
   A task force created by the city in 1988 after another fatal
social club fire inspected Happy Land on Nov. 20, 1988, and ordered
it closed.
   DiLorenzo has not returned telephone calls placed to his office
over the past several days, the newspaper said.
   The man who allegedly set the fire, Julio Gonzalez, was being
held in the psychiatric unit in the prison wing at Bellevue
Hospital.
   A friend of Gonzalez's, Juana Ortiz, told the New York Post he
was stricken with grief when told that one of his best friends died
in the March 25 fire at Happy Land Social Club.
   The friend, identified only as Ramon, had comforted Gonzalez
after he was evicted by the club's bouncer before the fire, Ms.
Ortiz said.
   She said when she told Gonzlalez that Ramon had died, he shouted
``Oh my God! Please forgive me!'' and broke down sobbing, the
newspaper reported in today's editions.
   Ortiz said Gonzalez is resigned to punishment and spends his day
reading a Spanish-language Bible.

   An angry judge criticized police for bungling
evidence in the raping of a Central Park jogger and ordered the
trial indefinitely postponed of three teen-agers charged in the
case.
   The judge granted on Monday an adjournment that prosecutors had
asked for while they await DNA test results from a newly discovered
semen stain on the victim's sock.
   State Supreme Court Justice Thomas Galligan said he was ``very
distressed'' that the sock had not been tested when the Police
Department has had it for almost a year.
   ``It's the eve of the trial and it's something that should have
been done a long time ago,'' he said.
   ``It seems to me almost negligence on the part of the police.''
   Jury selection was to begin April 16 for three of the six
teen-agers accused in the April 19, 1989, gang rape and beating of
a female jogger. Prosecutors said it would take six to 10 weeks for
the FBI to complete DNA testing on the stain.
   Galligan ordered the lawyers to return May 21 for an update.
   The stain was found Wednesday when an independent expert
examined all the clothing, said law enforcement sources who spoke
on condition they not be identified.
   The police lab apparently missed it because it was inside the
jogger's white cotton sock, the sources said. The independent
expert found the stain because it had discolored with age, they
said.
   Assistant district attorney Elizabeth Lederer sent a
hand-delivered letter to the judge and defense lawyers Thursday
asking for the adjournment.

<HEAD>Two Andy Warhol Works Stolen From Tokyo Exhibit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Andy Warhol silk-screen prints were stolen from
an exhibit of paintings, sculptures and other works of modern art
in Tokyo, police said today.
   Warhol's ``Paramount'' and ``The New Spirit,'' reportedly worth
$144,000 apiece, were reported stolen between 8 p.m. Sunday and 10
a.m. Monday at the Tokyo International Trade Center at Harumi, a
police spokesman said.
   Police were investigating the theft, he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Naoyuki Nagayama of Nippon Bijutsu Shuppan, the sponsor of the
five-day exhibition which ended Monday, said the prints were in
their places on the walls with other works when sponsors checked
before closing Sunday.
   After opening on Monday, the owner of the Warhol prints, Oliver
Caldwell, 39, a gallery owner in San Francisco, discovered that the
works were missing, Nagayama said.
   Warhol, an artist and filmmaker, was an initiator and leading
exponent of the pop art movement of the 1060s. He died in 1987.

<HEAD>Ann Arbor Adopts Abortion Rights, Tougher Marijuana Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters have declared this university
town a ``zone of reproductive freedom'' while making it a little
less free for marijuana smokers.
   Ann Arbor voters approved Monday a token $5 fine on abortion,
should state or federal laws ever ban the procedure, and boosted
the city's 18-year-old $5 marijuana possession penalty to $25.
   Both the doctor and the patient would be subject to the abortion
fine.
   The abortion proposal declaring Ann Arbor a ``zone of
reproductive freedom'' passed 15,698 to 8,578. The marijuana
measure passed 12,901 to 11,419.
   Sabra Briere, who gathered petitions in December to put the
abortion issue on the ballot, said the vote reaffirms Ann Arbor's
reputation as a pro-choice city.
   ``I think it's marvelous Proposal C won,'' Briere said. ``Once
again it showed me that this is where I want to live and these are
the people I want to live with. I'm very proud of Ann Arbor.''
   ``I think it's a very clear expression of Ann Arbor voters
saying we trust our women to manage their own personal lives more
than we trust the politicians in Lansing,'' said state Sen. Lana
Pollack, a Democrat from Ann Arbor.
   Rae Ann Houbeck of Right to Life of Washtenaw County said the
measure would encourage ``back alley abortions.''
   ``The measure trivializes the life of the child and the trauma
of the woman,'' Houbeck said.
   The marijuana measure was put on the ballot by the city council.
The $5 fine for possession and sale of marijuana was adopted in
1972 and reinstated through a voter-initiated city charter
amendment in 1974 after Republicans on the city council repealed it.
   Opponents of the fine said the minor penalty has created a
perception of the city as being a haven for drugs. The proposal to
increase the fine to $25 was seen as a compromise between
conservatives who wanted to treat marijuana possession as a
criminal offense and those who wanted to retain the token fine.
   State law for a first offense of possession of a small amount of
marijuana carries a maximum penalty of a $100 fine and 90 days in
jail.

<TEXT>
   A state- and city-funded bailout put
Buffalo's transit system back in operation this morning after a
two-day shutdown that forced thousands of bus and subway riders to
put on walking shoes or get a lift from friends.
   The Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority voted unanimously
Monday night to restart service this morning after the bailout
package was put together. It includes a fare increase and taxes
dedicated to transit.
   After the vote, NFTA Chairman Robert D. Gioia pleaded with the
system's 120,000 riders, ``We need you, and we need you back
immediately.''
   Riders, many of whom said they had stayed home during the
shutdown, were happy to oblige.
   ``I'm relieved,'' said accountant Connie Nicastro. ``I probably
would have been unemployed if I didn't make it back (to work)
today.''
   ``People with low incomes need the subway,'' agreed computer
operator Denise Matthews. ``I probably would have wound up on
social services and had the state pay for my living'' if the
shutdown had continued.
   The transit system, consisting of a six-mile subway line and
1,015 miles of bus routes, ran out of cash and shut down Sunday,
its crisis blamed on rising operating costs, falling federal
subsidies and the Erie County Legislature's refusal as recently as
four days earlier to agree on a tax dedicated to the system.
   On Monday, commuters bicycled or walked to work through rain and
fog or hitched rides with friends.
   ``My sister-in-law has this old junky piece of car and said we
could use it if we could find out what's wrong with it,'' said
Tequita Craig, a nurse's aide. ``We dished out $70 for a new
battery.''
   ``Everybody was walking together with sneakers on. Can you
believe it?'' said Tennizee High, who walked 1{ hours to her job.
   Police said traffic was near normal, and few businesses reported
any serious absenteeism. Schools in New York's second-largest city
remained open and Buffalo's 25,000 elementary students rode private
buses as usual.
   But up to 60 percent of Buffalo's 11,000 high school students
missed classes, and many commuters worried about the effects of a
long shutdown.
   ``It's inconveniencing my mother to come down and pick me up,''
said bank employee Lisa Cunningham. ``I hated to ask her, but what
could I do? I couldn't have walked.''
   Parts of the bailout are subject to approval by the Buffalo
Common Council and the county Legislature. But council approval was
expected, and county lawmakers said they had commitments in writing
from the 12 members needed to pass the package.
   The bailout erased the last $3.7 million of a $15.6 million
funding gap by a combination of accounting changes and grants of $1
million from the city and $750,000 from the state.
   Fares would rise from $1 to $1.10, and the county real estate
transfer tax would more than double, a move industry spokesman Joe
McIvor called ``grossly unfair.'' Next year, the agency would begin
receiving a share of county sales tax revenue.
   Gioia said the package means that Buffalo's system will for the
first time be supported by taxes dedicated to it. Most public
transportation systems, including New York City's, are funded that
way.
   ``We have been trying to find a dedicated stream of revenue for
this institution for 11 years,'' Gioia said. The system, which
costs $55 million a year to run, had depended on farebox revenue
and state, county and federal grants.
   In 1981, federally subsidized bus systems in Youngstown, Ohio,
and Birmingham, Ala., failed because they were unable to raise
taxes. But Youngstown got an advance on state funding until the
levy passed, and Birmingham was revived by a beer tax.

   The Soviet government today closed the
only border crossing between Poland and the Baltic republic of
Lithuania, the Polish Foreign Ministry said.
   Soviet officials informed their Polish counterparts at the
border that the crossing from the Polish town of Ogrodniki to the
Lithuanian town of Lazdijai was temporarily closed at 9 a.m., the
Polish news agency PAP said.
   A spokesman for the Polish Foreign Ministry confirmed that the
border crossing was closed but said there would be no immediate
comment.
   The border crossing, in the extreme northeast corner of Poland,
can be used only by Poles and Soviet citizens.
   Late last month, the Soviet Union informed Poland that it was
suspending visa-free travel for Poles and Lithuanians across the
border.
   Polish border officials had reported reduced traffic at the
crossing during the tense weeks after Lithuania declared
independence from the Soviet Union on March 11, PAP said.
   On Sunday, 4,039 people and 810 vehicles used the border
crossing, PAP said.
   Poland is the only foreign country bordering Lithuania. The
Baltic forms a section of the republic's western border.
   Poles returning to Poland from the Soviet Union and Soviet
citizens leaving Poland were allowed to continue to use the
crossing today, PAP said.
   The agency also said workers with valid Soviet visas were
permitted across the border for their jobs, and that cargo
transportation was continuing. However, bus routes using the
crossing were canceled, PAP said.

   A broken pipe sprayed water on
electrical equipment, interrupting testing of the $1.5 billion
Hubble Space Telescope and threatening to postpone its launch
aboard Discovery on Tuesday, NASA says.
   The water caused a temporary power outage that knocked out air
conditioning at part of the Kennedy Space Center, the space agency
said.
   The loss of air conditioning forced the shutdown of
heat-sensitive equipment, including some computers. That in turn
interrupted testing of the Hubble and space shuttle Discovery, on
the launch pad awaiting liftoff.
   The 25,000-pound telescope was never in any danger from the
cooling-system breakdown, said NASA spokesman George Diller.
   Some of the computers were back up early Monday evening, and
testing was expected to resume later today.
   ``Since the full effect of the loss of the chillers is still
being determined, we don't know whether there's an effect on the
launch date,'' Diller said.
   Technicians began charging the telescope's batteries again
Monday night, and Diller said the fact that the charging has
resumed is a good sign.
   NASA on Saturday moved up launch from April 12 to April 10 since
technicians had needed little of the contingency time built into
the schedule. No contingency time was left as of today, however,
Diller said.
   ``We can't afford even a hiccup'' if the launch is to be April
10, he said.
   The Hubble telescope, the most expensive unmanned spacecraft
ever, will orbit 380 miles above Earth once it is deployed by
Discovery's five astronauts.
   It will be capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and
with 10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based
observatory.
   Astronomers plan to use the telescope to study stars and
galaxies so distant that their light has been traveling toward
Earth for 14 billion years.

   The White House has rejected Housing Secretary
Jack Kemp's choice of Mary K. Bush to head a new agency created as
part of the savings and loan bailout, the administration said
today. Her award of three no-bid contracts is under investigation.
   Ms. Bush has been serving as acting director of the Federal
Housing Finance Board for seven months awaiting her promised
appointment as its chairwoman.
   But the appointment was put in jeopardy by news accounts of
three contracts she awarded friends from the Reagan administration.
The contracts are being investigated by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development's inspector general, with a report expected
by week's end.
   An administration official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said today that Ms. Bush was no longer under
consideration for the position.
   Mary Brunette, Kemp's top aide, said Kemp has offered Ms. Bush a
full-time job as director of the agency. In that post, she would
not be a voting member of the part-time board but would oversee the
agency's day-to-day activities.
   Ms. Bush, who is not related to President Bush, has not
responded to Kemp's offer. Her spokesman, Joseph Slye, said today
that Ms. Bush has not been informed of the administration's
decision, which was first reported today in The Washington Post.
   The Federal Housing Finance Board was created as part of the
savings and loan bailout plan to oversee the 12 regional Federal
Home Loan Banks, which must put a percentage of their profits each
year into affordable housing programs.
   The agency is independent of HUD, but has been under Kemp's
control because he is the only member of its board who has been
named.
   Ms. Bush, a Treasury Department official during the Reagan
administration, was a vice president of the Federal National
Mortgage Association before leaving to head the new board last
September.
   Publicly, Kemp aides continued to support Ms. Bush for the job
even as they were informed Monday that the White House would not
approve her nomination as chairwoman. But at least one top Kemp
deputy expressed hope privately as far back as two months ago that
Ms. Bush would leave the agency, which controls millions of dollars
in new housing funds.
   Ms. Bush, according to sources, disagreed with Kemp's plans to
seek a part-time board and also protested when the top Kemp deputy,
HUD Undersecretary Alfred A. DelliBovi, forced her to hire a
consultant she did not want to employ. Kemp's plans still face
opposition in Congress, where lawmakers who drafted the legislation
to create the agency say the board was designed as full-time.
   Kemp's aides have said that Kemp and others at HUD were not
aware until two weeks ago of the no-bid contracts, one of which was
awarded to Kemp's former chief of staff at HUD, Wendell Gunn.
   Gunn, however, said he personally told Kemp of the arrangment in
November and offered to terminate his contract if Kemp wanted him
to do so. And DelliBovi, in a memo about the Housing Finance Board
written Feb. 5 to several top Kemp aides, twice referred to
``Wendell,'' once in a listing of people being paid by the agency.

   Israel today displayed its rocket and
technological prowess, launching the Ofek-2 communications
satellite, the second in a series of experimental spacecraft.
   The satellite is widely viewed in the Arab world as a spycraft
that will allow Israel to have immediate intelligence on Arab
military moves.
   The launch came one day after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
threatened to use chemical weapons against Israel if attacked. But
Israel Space Agency head Yuvaal Neeman denied that the satellite
had any military purpose or that the long-rumored launch was in any
way a response to the warning.
   ``We don't send satellites because of threats,'' he said.
   Neeman described the new satellite as experimental and similar
to the Ofek-1 launched aboard a gray, three-stage rocket Sept. 19,
1988.
   ``The only difference is that we can call the satellite and send
it messages and receive answers back,'' Neeman said, adding: ``It
is not a spy satellite and has no military significance.''
   Witnesses said the rocket lifted off at 3:02 p.m., rising slowly
above a ball of orange flame and leaving a zig-zag trail of white
smoke.
   It was launched from an undisclosed site in the center of the
country, and entered orbit 90 minutes later.
   The satellite's orbit will range from 125 miles at its lowest
point to 923 miles at its highest, according to Space Agency
spokesman Avi Sarhan.
   ``We said at the launch of Ofek 1 that there would be a whole
line of satellites afterwards. Ofek 2 is just one more step, a
successful step, in this program,'' Sarhan said.
   He said the Ofek 2 weighed 374 pounds, the same as Ofek-1.
   ``It is a technological satellite leading to a scientific
satellite,'' Sarhan said. ``There is no equipment on it to examine
space as NASA has. The next ones should have this ability.''
   Analysts have said Israel needed its own satellite so as not to
be dependent on the United States for satellite information.
   Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader who has been picked to head
Israel's new government, told reporters the launch proved Israel's
scientific ability.
   ``It shows that Israel is a highly developed country, and we are
able to defend our lives,'' Peres said. ``We are not looking for
wars. But we are looking for security and hopefully for a region
and a time where nobody will need military equipment.''
   He said the launch should remind Iraq's president ``that if he
wants to deal with Israel, he should look for other means than the
military one.''
   Gerald Steinberg, a professor at Hebrew University and an expert
on strategic technology, noted Israel had launched the rocket
westward, toward the Mediterranean Sea, so as not to alarm its Arab
neighbors.
   ``Israel has a policy not to send missiles toward Arab
nations,'' he said, adding Israel also had a policy of not
revealing characteristics of the missile to Israel's Arab enemies.
   Despite the secrecy surrounding the launch, civilians including
a busload of school children stopped to watch the rocket rise on a
curving arch into the partly cloudy skies.
   In launching the first satellite in 1988, Israel used a modified
version of the Jericho II rocket and the lift-off demonstrated
Israel's ability to use medium-range missiles, according to foreign
reports.
   The first satellie rose to a height of about 155 miles, its
closest point to earth, and reached a distance of about 620 miles.
It burned up in the atmosphere returning to earth on Jan. 14, 1989.

   Gel-like fuel creeping down the Allegheny
River today fouled water supplies and stymied steel, glass and
juice factories, but the water supplies of Pittsburgh and some
nearby towns appeared to have been spared.
   Water had to be trucked into one community where intake valves
were closed Monday because of the spill of up to 300,000 gallons of
diesel, gasoline and kerosene that leaked after a landslide Friday
ruptured a 10-inch-wide pipeline near Freeport, 35 miles north of
Pittsburgh.
   But water service to Pittsburgh residents continued normally
today. The slick hugged the south bank of the river when it reached
downtown Pittsburgh during the night and missed main water intake
pipes operated by the Pittsburgh Water Authority, which serves
about 450,000 customers, authority spokeswoman Donna Sagmeister
said.
   A number of communities near Pittsburgh reopened their intake
pipes as the fuel passed, but still asked customers to use water
sparingly. Pittsburgh and suburban water authority officials today
said they were treating river water with increased amounts of
chemicals for safety.
   ``We've been able to treat the spill as it has been passing us
for now,'' Ms. Sagmeister said today. ``There are still pockets of
oil floating, and if one of those pockets should park itself in
front of our intake valves, we could be in trouble. But right now
it's moving slowly and in a fashion that we can treat it and not
shut down.''
   ``There's a slight sheen on the river right now, but a lot of
the fuel has evaporated,'' Environmental Protection Agency
spokeswoman Carrie Deitzel said late Monday.
   The spill had threatened the water supplies of up to 1 million
people.
   At least 2,500 workers in the industrial valley were told to
stay home Monday, although the Coast Guard by nightfall reopened a
10-mile stretch of the river to barges and other vessels after a
two-day hiatus.
   Later Monday, Harrison Township, the only suburban community to
lose water service because of the accident, was able to resume
pumping because petroleum concentrations had dropped. Township
customers nevertheless should boil their water for drinking and
cooking, the Allegheny County Health Department said.
   The National Guard had sent 100 water trailers and a brewery
took bottled water to Harrison Township, where 20,000 people were
without water Monday.
   Factories, offices and about 400,000 people were advised to
conserve water as the 20-mile spill, a mass 5 to 21 feet deep,
oozed into Pittsburgh at half a mile an hour or less, forcing
communities to shut their intakes one one by one.
   Birds carried fuel to at least two nests, where eggs were coated
and ``can be considered dead,'' said Environmental Protection
Agency spokeswoman Carrie Deitzel. Dead fish are expected to rise
to the surface later, she said.
   Daily Juice Products Inc. in Verona suspended production of
pasteurized juice. The plant uses 100,000 gallons of water a day,
said plant manager Bob Rivett. Five tanker trucks delivered water
to make non-pasteurized drinks, he said.
   Steelmaker Allegheny Ludlum Inc. trucked in water for the
toilets and other uses at its 2,600-employee plant in Brackenridge.
PPG Industries Inc. halted production of automotive glass at its
Creighton plant, which employs 360 people.
   Plants making made cough syrup, steel office furniture and
electronic circuit boards also either cut production or were closed.
   Emergency officials trucked in water to replenish a
45,000-gallon reservoir at Allegheny Valley Hospital, which draws
its water from the river. The hospital used paper plates and cups
to serve meals to its 225 patients, closed its laundry and sent
dirty linens to another hospital.
   At least nine school districts closed Monday, idling more than
21,000 students.
   Buckeye Pipeline Co. estimated 75,000 gallons of the mixed fuel
flowed into the river. But John Kaus of the Allegheny County
Emergency Management Authority and others said the amount was
closer to 200,000 to 300,000 gallons.
   Buckeye permit manager Roy Haase Jr. said the company and its
contractors had recovered 50,000 gallons of a fuel-and-water
mixture.
   About 100 people worked to collect oil and build a dam below the
spill site, where fuel continued to leach from a quagmire covering
the pipe.
   ``They are trying to stabilize that soil,'' Ms. Deitzel said.
``It's a precarious situation because it's saturated with fuel. ...
They're out there working with lifelines.''
   Two years ago, an Ashland Oil tank ruptured, sending 713,000
gallons of diesel fuel into the nearby Monongahela River and
affecting water supplies downtstream on the Ohio River as far away
as Sistersville, W.Va.

<TEXT>
   A draft declaration by U.S. Roman Catholic
bishops comes down square on the side of women, but backs off from
pushing for their ordination.
   Men and women ``are equal in dignity before God and before one
another,'' the proposed declaration stresses, and ``incapacity to
deal with women as equals'' indicates lack of fitness for the
priesthood.
   Women have been slighted by ``sexist patterns,'' and should have
more equitable roles in ``leadership, ministry, teaching and
policy-making,'' says the revised draft distributed to bishops on
Monday.
   Nonetheless, it reiterates the church's stand against admitting
women to the priesthood, and instead calls for more dialogue.
   Many women regard the ban as excluding them from church
``governance and authoritative teaching,'' the draft said, but it
defended the practice as that of Jesus and his apostles.
   It ``is not arbitrary, nor is it rooted in a view that women are
inferior as persons,'' the draft said. ``We pray that disagreement
will not cause anyone to take leave of the church.''
   On a related matter, the draft urges the Vatican to speed up
study of admitting women to the diaconate, historically a
preliminary step to the priesthood for men, and to ``the lay
ministries'' of lectors and readers of Scripture at worship
services.
   The Vatican should also examine further whether girls can be
acolytes, or altar girls.
   ``The exclusion of women and girls from certain aspects of
service at the altar ... seem to contradict our mandate that women
be more visibly involved,'' the draft said.
   ``We encourage participation by women in all liturgical
ministries that do not require ordination. Similarly we support the
theological preparation of women to preach the gospel and to use
their gifts as preachers in the church.''
   A bishops' committee, authorized by the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, has been working on the proposed pastoral letter
on women for about five years.
   The 99-page second draft, 65 pages shorter than a 1988 draft,
was sent to the church's approximately 350 bishops asking for their
responses. The bishops hold their annual meeting in November.
   The draft says numerous church practices have ``depersonalized
and depreciated women'' and left them ``objects of suspicion,
condemnation, condescension or simply ignored.''
   ``We intend, therefore, to ensure that women are empowered to
assume positions of authority and leadership in church life in a
wide range of situations and ministries,'' it said.
   The document, called ``One in Christ Jesus _ A Pastoral Response
to the Concerns of Women for Church and Society,'' was drawn up by
a six-bishop committee headed by Bishop Joseph L. Imesch of Joliet,
Ill.
   Five women served as consultants, and 75,000 women in 100
dioceses, 25 national women's organizations and 60 college campuses
sent advice.
   The draft calls changes in ``power structures and lifestyles
found within our own house that prevent the proper advancement of
women,'' and asks each diocese to set up a commission to assure
rights of women.
   It endorses sexually inclusive language in church materials
referring both to people and to God, providing expressions that
``respect both the `masculine' and `feminine' attributes of God.''
   ``Christians must reject all prejudicial attitudes that persist
toward women, all structures and stereotypes that sublty or overtly
perpetuate injustices, all practices that make women feel as if
they are not accepted,'' it said.
   The draft touches on various other matters, applauding feminists
for advancing women's rights, the value of both single and married
life, church opposition to abortion and extra-marital sex, and
prohibition of contraception.
   On birth control, it says studies suggest ``a considerable
degree of non-compliance'' among Catholic women, but argues the
``marital act cannot be separated from openness to life.''

   A bomb hidden in a motor scooter exploded
in a crowded vegetable market in Punjab state today, killing at
least 31 people and wounding 70 others as Hindus celebrated a
religious holiday, police said.
   The bombing, which police blamed on Sikh separatists, raised to
39 the number killed since Monday in the northern state.
   Sikhs campaigning for a separate nation have killed more than
500 people so far this year in Punjab, a rich northern farming
state where they hold a slight majority over Hindus.
   Soon after the blast in Batala, 25 miles north of the Sikh holy
city of Amritsar, Hindu mobs hurled stones at a police station 150
yards from the vegetable market, senior police superintendent S.K.
Goel said.
   Goel was unsure whether any policemen were injured.
   The violence prompted officials to impose an indefinite curfew
on the city, he said, adding that ``the situation is very tense.''
   Most of those killed were Hindus and the wounded included both
Sikhs and Hindus, said Sanjeev Gupta, another senior police
official. Thirty-two of those wounded were in serious condition.
   Goel said the bomb exploded during a march by about 100,000
Hindus celebrating the birth of Rama, a heroic warrior-king. Rama
is extolled in Hindu lore as an incarnation of Vishnu, a member of
the supreme Hindu trinity of gods.
   Witnesses, contacted by telephone, said portions of bodies were
hurled across the market, which was covered with blood-soaked
pieces of vegetables.
   ``Some people were crying for help. Those who were lucky to
survive ran away in panic. Many shops, scooters and one car were
destroyed,'' said one witness who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier today, a bomb exploded on a bus in another town near
Amritsar, killing the driver and one passenger, both Sikhs, senior
police superintendent Anil Sharma said. Police blamed Sikh
extremists for the blast near Taragarh, 17 miles northeast of
Amritsar.
   Sikh Extremists initially targeted only Hindus in their campaign
but now have also turned their guns on Sikhs who don't support the
separatist cause.
   On Monday night, Sikh militants shot and killed four members of
a Sikh family in another part of Punjab, police said.
   At Salghowal, 95 miles southeast of Amritsar, five or six Sikh
gunmen burst into the farmhouse of a Sikh constable Monday night,
killing the policeman, his parents and a younger brother, senior
police superintendent Baramjit Singh said.
   Police also blamed Sikh extremists for an attack on a bus Monday
night in Uttar Pradesh state, which is separated from Punjab by
Haryana state, news agencies reported.
   United News of India said one police guard was killed and 11
passengers were wounded when five gunmen stopped the bus. But a
second police guard killed one of the gunmen and the others fled,
according to United News.
   Press Trust of India said police recovered a Chinese assault
rifle bearing the inscription ``Khalistan Commando Force.''
   Khalistan, which means ``Land of the Pure,'' is the name Sikh
militants use for the independent Sikh nation they want to create
in Punjab.
   The bus was halted while traveling between Bijnore and
Muzaffarnagar, about 75 miles northeast of New Delhi and about 95
miles from the Punjab-Haryana state line.
   Most attacks by Sikh extremists have occurred in Punjab.
Nationwide, Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of India's 880 million
people, while Hindus account for 82 percent.
   The militants say members of the Sikh faith, which has roots in
both Islam and Hinduism, are discriminated against politically and
culturally by the Hindu majority.

   The government began deploying
heavily armed soldiers and police today after President F.W. de
Klerk ordered a major crackdown on black factional fighting that
has claimed hundreds of lives.
   Police said army and police reinforcements were moving into the
ravaged Edendale Valley in the southeastern province of Natal to
halt virtual civil war between rival Zulu tribal factions.
   Police Maj. Piet Kitching said at least 55 people had been
killed and hundreds injured in the area over the past week.
   Military officials said combat units were being moved into Natal
and other regions, but declined to give numbers or other details.
Police in Edendale said army troops would set up barricades and
conduct patrols to stop the fighting.
   Black leader Nelson Mandela, wrapping up a two-day visit to
Natal, said he welcomed the government's concern for restoring
order but said officials should have talked to local black leaders
about the move.
   ``Unilateral action by the government without consulting
acknowledged leaders is bound to be ineffective regardless of
merit,'' said Mandela, the deputy president of the African National
Congress guerrilla movement.
   Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk are to meet Thursday to
discuss ways to deal with the worst wave of violence since riots in
the mid-1980s.
   Mandela defended the ANC's decision to pull out of April 11
peace talks with the government in protest against a recent police
shooting of black demonstrators. At least 11 blacks were killed in
the March 26 clash at Sebokeng, a township south of Johannesburg.
   If whites had been killed, ``white South Africa would be
screaming at the top of its voice,'' Mandela said. ''But because
it's blacks, whites think it is not important.''
   The talks were to have focused on removing barriers to
full-scale talks on extending voting rights to the 28 million black
majority.
   More than 12,000 refugees, mainly women and children, had fled
their homes in the Edendale area and were being sheltered at camps,
police said. Rival mobs had burned hundreds of houses in the area,
they said.
   The pro-apartheid opposition Conservative Party, which opposes
de Klerk's attempts to end apartheid and scrap white-minority rule,
denounced his moves today. It said he was pushing the nation into
``anarchy and chaos.''
   But reaction to the government moves was generally positive. The
liberal opposition Democratic Party endorsed the deployment of the
security forces to end the violence.
   De Klerk told Parliament on Monday he had ordered security
forces to launch a major drive to end unrest in black urban
townships and rural areas such as Natal. He said the army had been
ordered ``to act immediately, firmly and purposefully'' to end the
unrest.
   South Africa has been hit in recent weeks by the worst wave of
violence since riots in the mid-1980s.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC and other outlawed black opposition
groups in February and released Mandela after 27 years in jail. The
president says he wants to share political power with blacks and
end all judicial forms of racial segregation _ though still
maintain veto power for whites.

<HEAD>Shamir Aide Calls for Gas Mask Program; Iraqi Demonstrations Back
Saddam</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with pro-Saddam demonstrations in Iraq,
further Iraqi comment, Iraq wants chemical ban linked with nuclear

   An aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir urged
the government today to issue a gas mask to every Israeli after
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatened to use binary nerve gas
against Israel.
   In Iraq, Saddam's ruling Baath Party held rallies today in
Baghdad and major provincial cities in support of his statement
Monday. Iraqi officials insisted the threat was meant to deter
Israeli plans to attack.
   ``The people have the right to defend themselves,'' chanted some
of the demonstrators, who waved banners quoting from Saddam's
speech.
   The speech dominated the Israeli news. His statement and Israeli
leaders' counterthreats led every newspaper and the state broadcast
stations.
   Michael Dekel, an aide to Shamir and former deputy defense
minister, said he urged the prime minister to order distribution of
gas masks, now stored in warehouses.
   ``I simply want Prime Minister Shamir to move faster so that
every Israeli citizen will feel safe in his home,'' Dekel said.
``We need to prepare the civilian population, not only with
practice, but with equipment in the case of a surprise attack.''
   An army spokesman confirmed a newspaper report that the Home
Guard, in charge of civilian defense, has prepared instruction
videotapes on how to use gas masks for broadcast on national
television.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens told Israel radio Saddam's past use
of chemical weapons concerned him.
   ``Unconventional weapons in the hands of a man such as Hussein,
who has used chemical weapons in a massive way against Iran and the
Kurds, should be a warning not only to every Israeli but to the
world,'' Arens said.
   Iraq has been accused of using chemical weapons during its
1980-88 war with Iran, and against its Kurdish minority, an
allegation Iraqi officials deny.
   Saddam denied Iraq was developing nuclear weapons but said Iraq
possessed binary chemical weapons and would use them if Israel
attacked.
   ``I also say that if Israel dares to hit even one piece of steel
on any industrial site, we will make the fire eat half of Israel,''
he said in his Monday speech.
   Israel's Air Force bombed Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981
while Iraq was at war with Iran, claiming the facility was being
used to develop atomic weapons. Iraq denied the charge.
   The current issue of Newsweek magazine reported Israel was
planning a new Jericho III missile with a 4,000-mile range easily
capable of reaching Iraq. It quoted Western experts as saying
Israel possesses at least 100 atomic bombs.
   Israel has said it would not be the first to introduce nuclear
weapons into the Middle East conflict.
   An Iraqi official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
today his country's officials believe ``there is a military
operation designed by the Israelis with the authorization and
encouragement of the United States of America and Britain.''
   He cited Israeli warnings in recent months about Iraq's growing
military strength.
   The official termed Saddam's tough words ``a clear warning'' but
added, ``Israel is fully aware that we have no intention to attack
Israel.''
   In Geneva, Iraq indicated today it will not join a global ban on
chemical weapons unless it is linked to nuclear disarmament.
   While denying again that it sought to obtain triggers for
nuclear warheads, it charged that the rights of developing
countries are being violated by embargoes on transfer of products
and know-how that could be used in the production of chemical
weapons.
   Iraq ``has every right to acquire the means needed to defend
itself'' chief delegate Abdel Rahim Al Khatal told the Geneva
Conference on Disarmament.
   Al Khatal said a treaty banning the use, production and
stockpiling of chemical weapons ``would be widely supported if it
contains a binding commitment incumbent on nuclear weapon states.''

   Consumers could be the losers in the decision by
the American Heart Association to drop its seal of approval, a
nutritionist says.
   The association announced Monday that it would drop its
HeartGuide seal program but would continue to work closely with the
federal government on new food labeling regulations.
   The seal _ a heart with a checkmark inside _ was to be put on
foods low in sodium, cholesterol and saturated fats, if their
manufacturers paid a fee to the association. It was yanked after
the federal Food and Drug Administration said it would not support
the program.
   ``The FDA has made it clear it is against third-party
endorsements,'' Howard Lewis, director of health and science news
for the heart association, said. ``The government's only concern
was that they did not like third party organizations entering into
an area where they had legal responsibility.''
   The FDA sent a letter to the association Friday saying it would
not support the program. That followed a warning letter in February
threatening regulatory action. The program was launched in January.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture also refused to let the seal
appear on any of the food it regulates, which included meat,
poultry and frozen dinners.
   Consumer groups such as the Center for Science in the Public
Interest had earlier expressed concerns that the HeartGuide seal
might lull consumers into thinking they were buying an overall
health food, rather than foods that were considered best only for
the prevention of heart disease.
   ``The seal of approval was somewhat narrow,'' said Bonnie
Liebman, director of nutrition for CSPI. ``It looked only at
whether the food was good for your heart. Foods like vegetable
oils, margarines and some oils, they're low in saturated fat and
sodium, but we've been urged to cut back on all fats, not just
saturated fats, to reduce the risk of cancer.''
   Nonetheless, she called it a ``noble attempt'' to help consumers.
   ``If there's any victim, it's the befuddled consumer who's still
trying to make heads or tails out of food labeling. I'm a
nutritionist and I have trouble figuring out what's what at the
supermarket,'' she said.
   Under the HeartGuide program, food companies paid $15,000 to
$600,000 to submit their products for testing. Products which met
heart association guidelines would get the HeartGuide seal of
approval for their packaging.
   Consumer groups also said they were concerned that companies
that chose not to pay the money would be shunned by shoppers, even
if their products were identical to a product carrying the seal.
The money was to be used for a nutrition hotline and education
programs, as well as the cost of the testing itself.
   Heart association president Myron L. Weisfeldt of Baltimore said
Monday that the association would announce a revamped HeartGuide
program this summer, focusing on education, ``with added emphasis
on legislative and regulatory actions,'' for clearer food labeling.
   Weisfeldt said the heart association was encouraged that the FDA
plans to overhaul the government's labeling program.
   Ms. Liebman was skeptical. ``The FDA has actually said that it
plans to improve food labels, but that could take another decade or
two,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The murder trial of a prison inmate
charged in the death of his former wife while he was on brief
furlough was postponed today after the jurors' luggage was stolen.
   Sgt. Dan Dallas with the Merrillville Police Department said
today that the luggage was taken between Monday evening from two
vans parked at a restaurant near Interstate 65.
   The jury of nine men and three women was sworn in Monday evening
and was being transported to South Bend, about 60 miles east, where
opening statements in the Alan L. Matheney case were scheduled to
begin today.
   Lake Superior Court Judge James E. Letsinger said today that the
trial would be postponed until Wednesday.
   ``Come hell or high water, we'll get the jury to St. Joseph
County tonight,'' Letsinger said.
   The jurors spent Monday night at a hotel in Merrillville.
   Matheney, 39, is charged with murder and burglary in the March
1989 beating death of his former wife, Lisa Marie Bianco. The
prosecution is seeking the death penalty.
   Letsinger presided over the daylong jury selection Monday. St.
Joseph County Deputy Prosecutor John D. Krisor quizzed potential
jurors about their views of the death penalty, while defense
attorney Scott L. King asked their opinions of the insanity defense.
   Matheney has entered pleas of innocent and not responsible by
reason of insanity.
   The St. Joseph County courtroom where jurors will hear testimony
is a few miles from the city of Mishawaka, where Ms. Bianco, 29,
was found beaten to death outside her home March 4, 1989.
   Matheney, who had been freed earlier that day on an eight-hour
prison furlough, surrendered hours later. He was serving an
eight-year term for assaulting Ms. Bianco, who was apparently
unaware that a furlough had been granted.
   The decision to try to case in South Bend before a Lake County
judge and jury was an unusual change of venue granted Matheney.
Letsinger said the trial would last less than two weeks, but warned
of long days in court and weekend sessions. The jury will be
sequestered.

<HEAD>7 Policemen Slain After Traffickers Offer Rewards For Killing Them</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven policemen were killed in a 24-hour
period in Medellin after drug traffickers offered rewards for the
murder of policemen, the national police said today.
   Police killed seven gunmen in the rash of attacks Monday and
today, national police said in the northwestern city that is
headquarters for the Medellin drug cartel.
   There was no way to verify if the seven slain officers were
victims of gunmen seeking the nearly $4,300 bounty that authorities
said the Medellin cartel has offered for each policeman killed in
Colombia.
   The traffickers also offered $100,000 for the murder of each
member of the antinarcotics strike force of the national police,
the police said last week.
   None of the special force, numbering about 2,000 men, has been
killed yet.
   Drug barons are seeking to halt the government's policy of
extraditing traffickers to the United States.
   Meanwhile, a Bogota newspaper hard-hit by the drug traffickers
said in today's editions that new threats forced the daily to stop
publishing editorials supporting government action against drug
lords.
   El Espectador said it will suspend such editorials until the
government could assure the newspaper of safety from traffickers'
attacks.
   The newspaper urged government action against the drug
traffickers long before President Virgilio Barco started a
crackdown last Aug. 18 when a leading presidential hopeful was
slain by drug lords.
   The traffickers killed the daily's publisher, Guillermo Cano, in
a submachine gun attack in front of the newspaper's office Dec. 17,
1987. The traffickers detonated a truck bomb alongside the office
last Sept. 2, seriously damaging the two-story building.
   The traffickers have killed four El Espectador employees in the
past six months.
   The traffickers threatend in a communique last week to resume
killing government officials, judges, policemen and members of the
Cano family that owns El Espectador.
   The traffickers declared a unilateral truce last Jan. 17 in an
effort to persuade the government to end its crackdown, but
officials last week reiterated that they will not negotiate.
   From Aug. 17 through Jan. 17 the traffickers set off bombs and
committed other terrorist acts that killed 210 people.

<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush said today that her eyes are
showing improvement for the first time after radiation treatment
for irritation resulting from Graves disease.
   ``Last week was the first week without seeing double,'' she told
reporters this morning.
   She underwent 10 days of radiation treatment in January, and
doctors said it would take several weeks to determine if the
radiation had worked.
   ``I think the radiation worked. That's very good news,'' Mrs.
Bush said. However, she said she had not been evaluated recently by
her medical specialists.
   She made the comments after surprising tourists on the first
floor of the White House by conducting a brief ceremony to receive
a new historical book on the presidency.
   White House staffers gathered about 200 tourists in the main
foyer of the White House to watch Mrs. Bush formally accept the new
editions of ``The Presidents of the United States'' and ``The First
Ladies'' from the White House Historical Association president.
   She signed several copies of the books for delighted recipients
among the tourists. She joked that the family dog, Millie, lurking
shyly in the background, ``doesn't like tourists.''
   Mrs. Bush was diagnosed early last year with Graves disease, an
immune system disorder that initially caused weight loss by
affecting her thyroid. It also caused her eyes to be irritated and
resulted in double vision, especially in the mornings.
   Treatment with a radioactive liquid cured the thyroid effects,
but the eye irritation persisted even after doctors put Mrs. Bush
on the steroid, prednisone.
   The radiation treatments, administered on 10 successive days,
were the latest step in her treatment.

<HEAD>Labor Nears Agreement to Form New Governing Coalition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pivotal religious party today forged a
coalition with Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, who said the move
gave him the basis for forming ``a rather solid government.''
   After signing the accord with the Agudat Israel faction, leaders
of the left-of-center Labor met in Tel Aviv to consider requesting
a parliamentary vote Thursday on a new government, Israel radio
said.
   The accord with the ultra-Orthodox party created a political
momentum that gave Peres a chance in breaking his 60-60 deadlock
with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc in Parliament.
Agudat Israel has five seats.
   ``This means that we have closed completely the agreement and
have established the basis to form a rather solid government,
whether narrow or wide,'' he told reporters in Tel Aviv after the
signing.
   Peres was asked by President Chaim Herzog to compose a
government after Shamir's Likud-Labor Cabinet was toppled in a
Parliament vote of no confidence March 15. The crisis was triggered
by a dispute over Middle East peace proposals.
   Agudat Israel legislator Rabbi Menachem Porush strongly hinted
today that two breakaway Likud members, Avraham Sharir and Yitzhak
Modai, were nearing an agreement with Peres, and that other
ultra-Orthodox parties would also join a Labor government.
   But Modai denied he was joining a Peres government, army radio
quoted a Modai spokesman as saying.
   A sticking point in negotiations remained Modai's demand that
Israel refrain for at least six months from accepting Middle East
peace proposals of U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, army
radio said.
   Peres is a strong supporter of Baker's ideas for starting
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. His views and Shamir's reluctance
to accept the proposals brought about the government's fall last
month.
   In his remarks, Peres reiterated today that ``the real issue
today is how to proceed with the peace process.''
   Peres said he made no promises for controversial legislation
that religious parties have sought in the past, such as a ``Who is
a Jew'' amendment that would effectively outlaw non-Orthodox
conversions to Judaism.
   ``On the religious side, we didn't sell and we didnt' buy
anything. There is a legitimate status quo,'' Peres said.

<HEAD>Boeing Says Wires Cut Deliberately in Plane Being Assembled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. is investigating an apparent case
of industrial sabotage, after a jetliner failed tests because of
wires that had been cut.
   ``It clearly seems to have been deliberate,'' T. Craig Martin,
Boeing Commercial Airplane Group spokesman, said late Monday in an
interview. ``The evidence at this point would suggest it would be
an employee but we want to find out for sure.''
   Boeing's security personnel are investigating, the company said
in a statement.
   The Boeing 737 was in final assembly and undergoing testing at a
Renton plant when the cut wires were discovered, Martin said. It
had not been determined in what stage of construction the wires
were cut, he said.
   Boeing released a statement Monday after KIRO-TV reported the
cut wires. The damage was found about two weeks ago.
   ``Scores'' of wires were severed, KIRO reported. It said there
was a pattern of one or two wires cut in a bundle of wires and the
broken ends hidden deep inside the bundle to mask the damage.
   Boeing would not divulge the number of wires severed and Martin
said he did not know the areas of the plane where the damage was
found. The aerospace giant said in its statement that repairs have
been scheduled on the aircraft.
   ``Because of the anomalies noted on this particular airplane, it
will receive an especially intensive examination,'' Boeing's
statement said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration has asked Boeing for
information on the wire-cutting incident and on what the company is
doing to ensure quality control at the plant, KIRO reported.
   FAA spokesman Dave Duff said it was unlikely that a deliberately
damaged plane could be certified for flight.
   ``The system is working as it should,'' Duff said.
   The incident occurred as Boeing is laying off some of its
production workers, mostly at its Everett plant, where it assembles
widebody 767s and 747s.
   Tom Baker, president of Machinists union District Lodge 751,
said, ``While members are angry at the company as a result of the
layoffs _ when they know and I know it's not needed _ I doubt that
anger would be aimed at any type of sabotage.''
   There have been no been previous cases of sabotage at Boeing
``to our knowledge,'' said Boeing spokesman Mark Hooper. He said
anyone found responsible for sabotage would be fired and possibly
face criminal charges.

   Manuel Noriega says the United States offered to
drop his drug indictment in exchange for military concessions and
maintained that offer until it invaded Panama, according to two
activists who interviewed him.
   The former Panamanian leader said an agreement dismissing the
drug charges had been drawn up, but it fell apart when he balked at
efforts to use U.S. bases in his homeland as a staging area for an
invasion of Nicaragua, said Gavrielle Gemma, official of a group
that opposes the U.S. action in Panama.
   ```The Panamanian government did not want to invade
Nicaragua,''' she quoted Noriega as saying Monday. ```The United
States was interested in continuing to place interventionist troops
in the American continent that can be mobilized to control South
America, Central America and the Caribbean.'''
   Ms. Gemma and another official of the Independent Commission of
Inquiry on the U.S. invasion of Panama interviewed Noriega at the
federal courthouse in Miami for just over a half hour Monday.
   Noriega told them that despite U.S. refusal to recognize his
government after an election was invalidated last year,
negotiations continued under both the Reagan and Bush
administrations.
   Two issues _ using Southern Command facilities for intervention
in Nicaragua, and U.S. pressure to maintain its Panamanian bases
after the year 2000 _ blocked any agreement, Ms. Gemma quoted
Noriega as saying.
   She also said Noriega told them he was aware the invasion was
coming two days before the United States launched it on Dec. 20.
   Noriega also commented on his relations with U.S. intelligence
agencies, Ms. Gemma said, but she said the commission would expand
on that Thursday at a news conference in New York.
   She said Noriega did not complain of his treatment, but was
concerned about the effects of the invasion on his homeland.
   Ms. Gemma and an assistant, Teresa Gutierrez, interviewed
Noriega in the presence of his attorneys and federal marshals, they
said.
   The commission _ which includes former U.S. Attorney General
Ramsey Clark, author Graham Greene and others _ has issued a report
opposing the invasion and saying civilian casualties probably
numbered in the thousands, not hundreds, as the Defense Department
maintained.
   Noriega faces 145 years in prison if convicted of a variety of
drug counts in a February 1988 indictment that accused him of
accepting bribes from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn
Panama into a way station for U.S.-bound cocaine. The trial is
scheduled for Jan. 28, 1991.

   Brent Musburger, closing out his 15-year career at
CBS on top by doing the play-by-play of the NCAA basketball
championship, bid goodbye to the network but not to sports
broadcasting.
   ``Folks, I've had the best seat in the house. Thanks for sharing
it. I'll see you down the road,'' Musburger said Monday in the
final moments of CBS' broadcast of the University of Nevada-Las
Vegas' 103-73 victory over Duke.
   CBS announced Sunday that it wouldn't renew Musburger's $2
million-a-year contract after it expires June 30.
   Musburger, CBS' signature sports voice for more than a decade,
saved his brief farewell for the end of the game.
   ``As you know, this was my last assignment with CBS after 22
years with the television network, radio network and the
stations,'' Musburger said.
   ``I had an opportunity to work with the greatest directors,
producers, technicians in the world. Not to mention analysts, like
my good friend Billy Packer. Billy, we have shared some great
memories.''
   Musburger then put his arm around Packer, his broadcasting
partner on college basketball.
   After the broadcast, fans in McNichols Arena shouted
encouragement to Musburger.
   ``You're a pro, baby,'' one yelled.
   Musburger saluted the fans with a thumbs-up and raised his index
finger to signify No. 1. His assistant, Jimmy Tubbs, said the
broadcaster would not discuss his departure from CBS while in
Denver but would be available later in the week.
   The main issues in Musburger's contract dispute apparently were
money and high-profile assignments, CBS said. Musburger, the
network's most prominent sportscaster, wanted more of both than the
network was willing to give.
   Musburger is in his sixth season as lead play-by-play man for
the NCAA basketball tournament and has been host of ``The NFL
Today'' since 1975. He also has broadcast college football and was
anchorman of CBS' coverage of the Masters golf tournament, the NBA
finals, the Pan American Games and U.S. Open tennis highlights.
   CBS' most pressing problem in replacing Musburger is finding
another No. 1 baseball broadcaster before airing its first game
April 14. Musburger was to have teamed with Tim McCarver on
baseball telecasts.
   He was also in line to be host of the network's coverage of the
1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics.
   Al Michaels is considered the top candidate to replace Musburger
if ABC lets him out of his contract, which runs into 1993.
Michaels, an experience baseball broadcaster, is reportedly feuding
with ABC's sports president.
   Michaels' agent, Art Kaminsky, would not speculate about his
client's chances of switching networks.
   Another possibility is simply filling Musburger's roles with
other CBS announcers. CBS Sports President Neal Pilson wants to
give younger sportscasters such as Jim Nantz, Greg Gumbel and James
Brown expanded duties.
   ``He's got a lot of talent there,'' Kaminsky said. ``He can take
care of this internally, if he chooses.''

   Two men were mistakenly freed from the Oslo
jail after a guard fell for an April Fool's Day joke, and they were
still on the loose Tuesday, newspapers reported.
   According to the reports, a friend of the prisoners called the
jail Sunday. Pretending to be a police officer, the prankster told
the guard the two men were being released and that the paperwork
would arrive soon.
   ``The idea was that they would be told of the release, but that
it wouldn't happen. I was trying to pull an April Fools' joke on
them,'' the prankster told newspapers on condition he was not
indentified.
   But the trusting guard gave the prisoners cash and clothing and
freed them without waiting for the release papers, reports said.
The men were awaiting trial on theft charges.
   ``I didn't think it was that easy to get people out of jail,''
the prankster said.

   Beef imported from the United States will be sold
in vending machines in Japan under a Japanese-U.S. joint venture
project, a Japanese official said Tuesday.
   ``Our aim is to supply imported beef at a cheaper price to
consumers by reducing the costs of distribution-related
personnel,'' said Naoki Sakai, a spokesman for Jackson Co.
   Jackson is a Japanese meat dealer based in the western port city
of Kobe. It joined with the Hamilton Meat Co., a meat packer based
in San Diego, to set up the joint venture, Sakai said.
   Sakai said it will be first time in Japan that beef has been
sold in vending machines.
   Seasoned beef for steak and sukiyaki will be processed in the
United States before being imported in frozen vacuum packages for
sale in Japan, Sakai said.
   The machines, equipped with freezers, will be set up at 1,000
locations, mainly near railway stations and convenience stores,
Sakai said.
   The company plans to sell a pack containing 17.5 ounces of beef
for about $11.30, about half the price of locally produced beef.
   The company will install the vending machines starting next week.

   Former Vietnamese Vice Premier Nguyen
Lam has died of illness and old age in the capital of Hanoi,
official Radio Hanoi reported. He was 68.
   Nguyen Lam, also a former top official of the ruling Communist
Party, died Sunday in an army hospital, the radio said. A text of
Monday's broadcast was seen in Bangkok on Tuesday.
   It said he had a serious brain infection due to many years of a
cerebral blood circulation disorder.
   The radio quoted an official communique as saying the body will
lie in state in Hanoi before being buried in a ceremony Thursday
organized by senior party officials.
   The official Vietnam News Agency said Nguyen Lam was born Dec.
31, 1921 in the northern province of Ha Nam Ninh. It said he was a
member and secretary of the party's Central Committee and was vice
premier in 1976 _ a year after the Communists defeated the
U.S.-backed South Vietnam government and reunified the country.
   The agency said Nguyen Lam had been a recipient of the Ho Chi
Minh Order, the nation's highest award.

<HEAD>Ancient Mosaic Stolen From Castle Floor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 1,300-year-old mosaic floor painting was
stolen from an ancient castle, apparently by professionals who cut
the 270-square-foot block into small pieces and fled without a
trace, officials said Tuesday.
   The minister of tourism, Abdul Karim Kabariti, said the mosaic
depicting a tree of life was ``priceless.'' He said the theft
occurred Sunday at the Hallabat Castle, a popular tourist
attraction in the northeastern desert.
   ``It appears to be a highly professional job,'' the minister
said. ``They have left no traces whatsoever, not even tire tracks
on the desert road.''
   The colorful mosaic depicts a large tree surrounded by animals.
It was lifted off a floor of the castle.
   A police expert, who cannot be identified under police
regulations, said it would have ``taken at least four people to do
the job.''
   ``It involved applying a strong liquid glue on the surface of
the mosaic, covering it with jute cloth and lifting the entire
thing at one time off the floor,'' the expert said.
   Adnan Hadidi, former director of the Department of Antiquities,
said it appeared the painting was ``cut into small blocks after it
was lifted off the floor.''
   Kabariti said all exit points of the kingdom, including airports
and sea ports, were alerted.
   Authorities said there would be a reward for information leading
to the recovery of the mosaic, but the amount was not disclosed.
   Kabariti said the work dates back to the 8th century A.D. rule
of the Ummayads, an Arab dynasty based in Damascus, Syria.

   A bomb exploded in the eastern city of
Lahore on Tuesday, causing four deaths and injuring 22 people,
police said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the mid-afternoon explosion in
a congested marketplace in Lahore's old city, said a police
officer, who refused to be identified.
   The bomb was hidden in a cardboard crate left beside a fruit
vendor, police said. The vendor spotted the abandoned crate and it
exploded when he tried to move it, officers at the scene said.
   Bombs frequently explode in Pakistani cities but seldom in
Lahore.
   Many explosions have occurred in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier
Province, which houses more than 3 million Afghan refugees who fled
a bloody civil war in neighboring Afghanistan.
   Police regularly blame those bombings on agents of Afghanistan's
Communist government, a charge Afghanistan's president denies.

   Guards drove back the last group of
inmates holding a decaying Victorian prison and recaptured
two-thirds of it today, while negotiators sought a peaceful end to
the 3-day-old siege.
   Seven officers were injured trying to regain control of
Strangeways Prison, said Ivor Serle, a prison guard and chairman of
the local branch of the Prison Officers' Association.
   ``There were many broken bones, and one officer has a punctured
lung,'' Serle said, adding that most of the injuries were caused by
bricks, poles and other objects hurled by prisoners.
   There was no word on how many prisoners, if any, were injured.
The guards' advance could not be seen by reporters outside the
prison.
   At a second prison, 100 miles south of Manchester, 33 inmates
who barricaded part of a building after an attempted breakout ended
their protest peacefully this morning, the Home Office said. No
injuries were reported.
   Authorities have said 56 people _ 37 inmates and 19 guards _
have been injured at Strangeways since rioting broke out at a
chapel service Sunday morning.
   Though press reports have speculated that as many as 30 inmates
had been killed, Serle said no bodies had been recovered.
   He said it was his ``gut feeling'' that there had been some
deaths, but ``I hope to God I'm wrong.''
   Thirty-five prisoners surrendered today, leaving 64 behind, a
Home Office spokeswoman said. Serle said 84 inmates remained on the
loose.
   Twenty inmates who wanted to surrender were physically prevented
by other prisoners, Serle said.
   ``We have extended our control. Prisoners still control about
one-third of the jail. They're in the upper space,'' Serle told
reporters outside the prison. ``We're in control of all lower
portions of the prison.''
   In negotiations with prison governor Brendan O'Friel, the
rebellious inmates had demanded their surrender be witnessed by a
member of Parliament, and that they all be photographed to protect
them from beatings afterwards, Serle said.
   O'Friel agreed to a request by some inmates for an independent
witness to watch the surrender of prisoners, who are believed to be
injured, the Home Office said.
   One dejected looking, bare-chested inmate, his hands bound in
front of him, was led out on the prison roof this afternoon by a
masked prisoner carrying a large blade. They remained outside in
near-freezing weather for only a few minutes.
   Inmates displayed several banners on the roof of the prison
including one which said ``Told We Will Die,'' and another which
proclaimed ``Total War on E-Wing,'' the wing where sex offenders
were held.
   It was not immediately clear what prompted the uprising, but one
former inmate said conditions were poor.
   ``It's a hole, it's filthy, rotten, food is bad, it has no
taste, and they treat you like dogs,'' said Mike West, who said he
had been held at the prison a dozen times and was released just a
week ago.
   ``Imagine being in a little box, two or three men, only one
shower a week,'' West said in an interview outside the prison.
   By Monday afternoon, 1,458 inmates had been transferred to other
prisons and 74 were awaiting transport, the Home Office said.
   The Strangeways riot began when prisoners at a religious service
took keys from guards and used them to gain access to large areas
of the prison.
   Relatives of inmates also said overcrowding added to tension at
Strangeways, where up to three prisoners were housed in cells built
for one. They cited unsanitary conditions, and prisoners being
locked in cells for up to 23 hours a day. Red-brick Strangeways was
built in 1868 to hold 970 men. It had 1,648 prisoners on Sunday.
   It contains inmates of all categories, from extremely dangerous
to low risk.
   The Home Office said trouble at the minimum-security Long Lartin
Prison began late Monday when inmates tried to escape. Guards
stopped the convicts as they attempted to scale the 15-foot wire
mesh perimeter.
   The guards led them back into the building without violence. But
by then inmates in a wing of the low-security prison had begun
demonstrating, forcing guards to retreat.
   The Home Office said nine prisoners were involved in the foiled
breakout at the prison, which holds 430 inmates. No injuries were
reported.

   Restaurateur by any spelling, whether
with an ``n'' or without, is not a favorite word of keepers of the
language, according to a survey.
   But if they have to use the word for keeper of a restaurant,
they'll take it without the ``n,'' said respondents to the 12th
English language usage survey by the Indiana University School of
Journalism.
   ``Many in the survey found it stuffy no matter how it is
spelled, though its use is patently expanding in this country,''
Professor Richard L. Tobin wrote in the survey released this week.
   The 10-question survey was mailed to 100 newspaper copy editors
and 50 magazine editors in the United States and Canada and got a
60 percent return, Tobin said.
   ``The consensus throughout this year's survey was mighty close
to unanimous in almost every example, which just goes to show that
copyreaders know what they're doing and do it like the sterling
language-usage guardians they are put there to be,'' the survey
said.
   Nearly all editors agree ``percent'' should be one word and not
two.
   Most editors agreed the region Deep South should be uppercase.
   Most copydesks caught the misuse of ``tremblor'' instead of
``temblor,'' in a line from a Maryland newspaper reporting a Palm
Springs earthquake.
   Most changed ``forego'' to ``forgo'' in the sentence: ``The
university decided to forego the traditional faculty banquet
because of the financial situation.''
   Copydesks were asked whether ``gibe'' or ``jibe'' was correct in
the following sentence: ``Three suspects were taken to police
headquarters but detectives announced later that their stories
didn't gibe.'' The verdict was almost unanimous that ``jibe'' was
correct.
   ``Complacent'' was correctly preferred over ``complaisant'' in
an item saying a soccer team had become ``complaisant'' after four
straight victories.
   Most Canadians agree a person of Scottish descent is ``Scotch''
rather than ``Scot,'' which is preferred in the homeland.
   ``Several respondents in our survey said they'd given up trying
to substitute `Scot' for `Scotch,' and anyway it really didn't
matter all that much,'' the survey said.
   Editors chose ``theretofore'' over ``hitherto'' in the sentence:
``In 1864, President Lincoln spent the hitherto unheard of sum of
$3,000,000 on naval construction.''
   Almost no one chose ``peddle'' over ``pedal'' in the final
question, which came from a Florida sports page: ``When you're
riding a bicycle you use the brake and the peddle with caution on
today's highways.''

   A bomb believed set by Sikh radicals
exploded in the midst of a Hindu celebration Tuesday and killed at
least 33 people, police said. Enraged Hindus went on a rampage
afterward, and five police officers were reported injured.
   Most of the casualties from the bomb blast were Hindus, but some
Sikhs who had been watching the procession were among the victims.
Police said 68 people were injured in the explosion.
   The bomb went off as about 100,000 Hindus celebrating the birth
of a god-king marched through a crowded vegetable market in Batala.
The town is 25 miles north of Amritsar, the holiest Sikh city and
the stronghold of Sikh militants fighting for a separate nation in
Punjab state.
   Senior police superintendent S.K. Goel said the bomb was hidden
in a scooter parked outside a cigarette kiosk.
   Goel said 30 of the injured were in serious condition. He said
Sikh militants were probably responsible.
   The radicals have killed more than 500 people this year in their
quest for a Sikh homeland. They are a minority in Hindu-dominated
India but form the majority in Punjab, a farming state in northern
India.
   Soon after the blast, angry Hindus went on a rampage, hurling
stones at a police station near the market, said a police
inspector. He said five policemen were injured.
   Officers fired into the air to quell the riot, and an indefinite
curfew was imposed in Batala, a Hindu-dominated city of about
120,000 people.
   The annual procession marked Ram Navami, a Hindu holiday
celebrating the birth of Rama. Rama is extolled in Hindu lore as an
incarnation of Vishnu, a member of the supreme Hindu trinity of
gods.
   Food vendor Prem Nath described the explosion from his hospital
bed in Amritsar. ``There was loud sound. Then the entire area was
covered with dark smoke and fire which rose as high as electric
poles,'' he said.
   Earlier Tuesday, a bomb exploded on a bus in another town near
Amritsar, killing the driver and one passenger, senior police
superintendent Anil Sharma said.
   Police also blamed Sikh extremists for that blast. Both the
victims were Sikhs.
   When the Sikhs began their fight in 1982, they targeted Hindus.
In recent years they have turned their guns on fellow Sikhs who do
not support the separatist cause.
   The militants say members of the Sikh faith, which has roots in
both Islam and Hinduism, are discriminated against politically and
culturally by the Hindu-dominated government.

<HEAD>Wayward Lawyer-Pilot Released on Bond in Fraud Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON _</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer_</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney Thomas Root was released on bond
after pleading innocent to fraud and other charges Tuesday in a
case his attorney said ``would not be that big a deal for the
government'' if Root had not gained public attention last summer
when his airplane plunged into the Atlantic Ocean.
   Root was released on $200,000 bond, ordered to surrender his
passport and report semi-weekly by telephone to a probation officer
and confined to the continental United States until a trial date is
set.
   U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn said he will set a trial
date on April 23.
   Root was indicted March 22 on 20 counts of wire and mail fraud,
seven counts of filing false legal documents with the Federal
Communications Commission, four counts of using counterfeit and
altered federal documents, and one count each of forgery and
obstruction of a grand jury investigation.
   The charges against the Washington attorney arise out of his
representation of FM radio stations seeking construction permits.
   If convicted of all the charges, Root, 37, would face a maximum
200 years in prison and an $8 million fine.
   Root's single-engine plane ran out of gasoline and plunged into
the Atlantic off the Bahamas last July after a six-hour, 800-mile
flight that began near Washington. He told authorities he was
unconscious during most of the flight, but Navy fighter pilots
flying alongside his plane reported seeing him moving about. He
suffered an unexplained gunshot wound during the trip.
   The bond does not require Root to put up any cash, but his
property could be forfeited if he violates it. Assistant U.S.
Attorney David Eisenberg sought a more stringent bond, requiring
Root to post $10,000.
   Defense attorney Eugene Propper argued that Root should be free
on his own recognizance, saying the charges were ``a standard white
collar case'' and ``would not be that big a deal for the
government'' if the widely publicized plane ditching had not
occurred.
   Eisenberg replied, ``It is a big deal for the government, not
because somebody flew off ... but because it is a lawyer and a case
of falsifying documents.''
   The government attorney said that last April 24 officers serving
a search warrant on Root at the nearby Manassas, Va., airport found
numerous firearms, a knife, handcuffs and a marijuana leaf in and
around Root's airplane. He said the weapons were not illegal,
except for one unregistered silencer, but indicated that ``Root may
very well be a danger to himself ... and possibly even a danger to
the community.''
   Propper said all of the guns were federally registered and Root
loaned them to the Arlington, Va., police for target practice. He
said Root kept them at the airport because he has a wife and three
children at home. He said Root has since disposed of them.
   Root's attorney entered his plea for him. Root did not speak
except to say that he understood the conditions of his release on
bond.
   Propper asked to have the trial set six or seven months from now
to give the defense time to prepare. Eisenberg said the government
is ready to go to trial in 60 days to 90 days.
   Propper also said he needs time to consider a possible conflict
of interest that could disqualify him from representing Root. He
declined to say what it was.
   Eisenberg said Propper could be subpoeneaed to testify for the
government because he may have inadvertently witnessed an attempt
to interfere with justice in connection with the grand jury
proceedings.

   Dozens of residents packed their
belongings and left as lava from Kilauea Volcano crept to within
300 yards of their homes.
   Authorities had estimated the flow could reach the homes as
early as today, but the lava's movement toward the Kalapana Gardens
subdivision appeared to have slowed, said Hawaii County Civil
Defense spokesman Bruce Butts.
   Civil defense officials evacuated 50 homes Monday and put all
remaining residents of Kalapana Gardens on alert, meaning they
could be ordered within 72 hours to evacuate. They would be given
24 hours to leave.
   Officials were watching two major flows from the volcano, which
has erupted continually the past seven years.
   The flow posing the most immediate danger to the 125-home
subdivision was coming from the west, said Harry Kim, Hawaii County
Civil Defense Administrator. But a finger from that flow was
draining into a crater almost 100 feet deep, slowing its progress,
he said.
   Lava continued to pour into the crater early Tuesday, and Butts
said it was impossible to say when the flow could reach homes as
long as the diversion drained much of the power from the front of
the flow.
   The second flow, from the east, was less than three-quarters of
a mile from any residence, Kim said.
   Residents told to evacuate were leaving with as many possessions
as they could take, and some hired container trucks to take
everything they have.
   Many others were packing in anticipation of an eventual order to
leave.
   ``I ran into a couple of people who didn't seem too concerned
about it, but most people are concerned and moving whatever they
can,'' said Civil Defense spokesman Allen Parker.
   Since its latest and longest eruption began in 1983, the volcano
has destroyed 76 homes and a national park visitor center, causing
$20 million in damage.

<HEAD>Snipers Exchange Fire in Battle for Christian Sector</HEAD>

   Rival Christian armies exchanged grenade
and automatic weapons fire Tuesday in a battle for supremacy that
has killed more than 800 people in two months, most of them
innocent civilians.
   Police reported one person wounded.
   Christian sources said Nasrallah Sfeir, the Maronite Catholic
patriarch, planned to ask Pope John Paul II to help end the fight
for control of the 310-square-mile enclave north and east of
Beirut, where 1 million Christians live.
   In Sidon, the ancient port and provincial capital 25 miles south
of Beirut, three men killed a Lebanese army captain, using pistols
equipped with silencers.
   Police said Capt. Youssef Naamani, a 32-year-old Sunni Moslem,
died instantly and the motive for the attack was not known. They
said the gunmen had not been identified.
   Automatic weapons fire and explosions of rocket-propelled
grenades echoed across Christian east Beirut in exchanges between
forces loyal to rebel Gen. Michel Aoun and militiamen of the
Lebanese Forces, commanded by Samir Geagea.
   Smoke still billowed from storage depots in the Jal el-Dib
suburb. The depots, containing 2.5 million gallons of fuel, were
hit by phosphorous shells Monday.
   A three-man Christian mediation committee held separate meetings
with Aoun and Geagea but made no progress toward a cease-fire.
   Since it began Jan. 30, the showdown between Aoun's 19,000
Christian army troopers and Geagea's 6,000 militiamen has claimed
839 lives. At least 2,291 people have been wounded. Material damage
is estimated at $6 billion.
   The respected newspaper An-Nahar said Sfeir told the mediation
committee Monday he would seek the pope's intervention if
``domestic efforts to contain the deterioratrion couldn't achieve a
breakthrough.''
   It said Sfeir wanted President Elias Hrawi's government, which
has Syrian support, to ``spread its authority'' through the
Christian enclave and halt the conflict.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, a year after the Lebanese
civil war began.
   Both belligerents and President Hrawi are Maronite Catholic, the
largest Christian sect. Maronites have controlled key government
posts, the army and judiciary since independence from France in
1943.
   Aoun does not recognize Parliament's election of Hrawi on Nov.
24 and demands changes in a peace agreement, mediated by the Arab
League, that is intended to end the civil war. Parliament approved
the accord in October after meetings in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   Hrawi dismissed Aoun as army commander, but the general has
refused to stop aside. His commands his troops from a bunker
beneath the presidential palace in Baabda, a Christian suburb,
where he also lives. The president has temporary offices and living
quarters in Moslem west Beirut.
   Geagea declared in a radio interview Tuesday: ``The solution to
Lebanon's crisis lies in recognition of President Hrawi as head of
state.''
   In an interview with the Ad-Diyar newspaper, Aoun said he sent
letters proposing ``a serious dialogue'' about Lebanon to the
leaders of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria, sponsors of the Taif
negotiations.
   Foreign ministers of those countries are to meet in Rabat,
Morocco, on Wednesday to consider a report from Salim Hoss, Hrawi's
prime minister, on the situation in the Christian enclave.
   The United States and almost all nations with which Lebanon has
diplomatic relations have recognized Hrawi and declared support for
the Taif agreement, which provides for equal distribution of power
between Moslems and Christians.

<TEXT>
   During her husband's 20-year rule,
Imelda Marcos was praised by a controlled media as the ``Mother of
the Nation.''
   On Tuesday, the widow of former President Ferdinand Marcos went
on trial in federal court in New York as an accused embezzler and
racketeer, facing up to 50 years in prison and fines up to $1
million if convicted.
   Mrs. Marcos is accused of taking part in the illegal transfer of
$160 million from the Philippines and defrauding financial
institutions of $165 million to finance the purchase of New York
properties. Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi is accused of helping.
   Marcos died in September in Hawaii where he lived since he was
ousted four years ago in the popular uprising that propelled
Corazon Aquino to the presidency.
   ``The story of the Marcoses illustrates very vividly how fame,
riches and power can build, then destroy,'' wrote the Philippine
Daily Inquirer. ``It shows that wealth is no insurance for
security, peace of mind and happiness.''
   Mrs. Marcos had led a fairytale life, a glamorous beauty born in
near poverty who used charm and steely determination to become one
of the richest and most powerful women in the world.
   Imelda Remedios Visitacion Romualdez was born July 2, 1929, in
Manila to Vicente Romualdez, a lawyer, and his wife, Remedios.
Although the family was prominent, Imelda's father failed in
several business ventures and the family often struggled to survive.
   At age 26, after romances with several prominent Filipinos _
including Mrs. Aquino's future husband, Benigno Aquino Jr. _ Imelda
met and married Marcos, a rising political star 11 years her senior.
   She had three children: Imelda or ``Imee'' in 1955, Ferdinand
Jr. in 1958, and Irene in 1960.
   Mrs. Marcos soon became her husband's indefatigable campaigner,
charming audiences with her beauty and singing. When Marcos was
elected president in 1965, he credited Imelda with drawing a
million votes.
   Mrs. Marcos boasted she needed only a few hours sleep each night.
   ``We all wake up with the same energy,'' she once told The
Associated Press. ``But for me, the moment I see beautiful flowers,
a beautiful smile, a beautiful deed ... this energizes me, so by
the time it's midnight I am just ready to take off.''
   As first lady, her power and influence in the Philippines became
second only to that of Marcos, especially after he declared eight
years of martial law in 1972.
   In 1978, Mrs. Marcos won a seat in the National Assembly,
defeating Aquino who campaigned from his jail cell. Aquino later
went into exile in Boston, and was assassinated in 1983 moments
after returning to the Philippines to challenge the Marcoses for
national leadership.
   Marcos also named his wife ``presidential envoy
plenipotentiary,'' and she made as many as 15 trips a year to
confer with world leaders.
   Mrs. Marcos was credited with improving relations with the
Soviet Union and China, negotiating oil deals with Mexico and
cooling the Philippines Moslem rebellion by a meeting with Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   She so deeply charmed Cuban President Fidel Castro that he once
told her admiringly: ``My lady, what is there that you cannot do?''
   She had a fondness for American movie stars, including her close
friend George Hamilton.
   As her influence grew, she declared that she would commit her
life to improving Filipino culture, beautifying cities and towns
and improving the lot of the impoverished masses.
   As the appointed governor of Metro Manila, Mrs. Marcos built a
$10 million cultural center on reclaimed land in Manila Bay. She
also built bridges, schools, hotels and hospitals.
   In her post of minister of Human Settlements, she built
thousands of houses, planted hundreds of thousands of trees and
loaned money for small-scale livelihood projects.
   Critics charged Mrs. Marcos used her trips abroad for massive
spending sprees in fashionable boutiques. She frequently flew to
the fun spots of the world, often with an entourage known as the
``Blue Ladies'' because of their dress.

<HEAD>Mrs. Bush Says Double Vision Gone</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Barbara Bush said Tuesday that she no longer
suffers double vision caused by Graves disease.
   ``Last week was the first week without seeing double,'' she told
reporters at the White House. ``I think the radiation worked.
That's very good news.''
   However, Mrs. Bush said she had not been evaluated recently by
specialists.
   She said she believes radiation treatment she underwent in
January has affected the vision problem. Aides had said it would
take two to four months before it would be known if the treatment
was effective.
   Mrs. Bush was diagnosed early last year with Graves disease, an
immune system disorder that initially attacked her thyroid, causing
dramatic weight loss. It caused eye irritation and double vision,
especially in the morning.
   The first lady chatted with two reporters Tuesday morning after
she surprised tourists, showing up in the White House main foyer
where the tours pass.
   Mrs. Bush decided to conduct a small ceremony at the foot of the
grand staircase to receive the new editions of ``The Presidents of
the United States'' and ``The First Ladies'' from White House
Historical Association president Robert L. Breeden.
   About 200 tourists shushed one another and strained to hear
Breeden and Mrs. Bush in the large, drafty foyer. Mrs. Bush
autographed several copies of the books.
   She opened to a page with her husband's picture and held it up
for the crowd's applause. When Breeden held up the page with her
photograph, she wrinkled her nose and said, ``Yuck.''
   After trying unsuccessfully to coax the family dog, Millie, down
the stairs, Mrs. Bush joked: ``She doesn't like tourists. I do.''
   Mrs. Bush said she was glad to be asked about her health, saying
reports she is not doing well are fabricated. She has acknowledged
frustration with the stubborn eye irritation, which persisted even
after the thyroid condition improved.
   Doctors prescribed the steroid prednisone to treat her eyes,
resorting to radiation treatments when the drugs had no effect.

   When parking enforcement officer Karla Hayes hops
into her official blue-and-white three-wheeler scooter, she makes
sure she has a ticket pad, pencil and bulletproof vest.
   It is, indeed, a jungle out there, say Hayes and other parking
officers, most of them women. Curses, yells, spit, and death
threats have all come their way recently.
   ``It's gone way beyond a few people being upset about getting a
ticket,'' Hayes said. ``It's become a free-for-all out there.''
   Parking officers, especially union activists frustrated by the
city's hard-line position in labor-contract negotiations, may have
invited some of the additional hostility.
   Two weeks ago, in an effort to pressure the city, some parking
officers began writing tickets for violations they used to ignore.
   Lt. Pat Barker said he has canceled a lot of tickets that he
considered nitpicking. He also said he has told officers to stop
writing questionable tickets.
   Anne Peters, who patrols downtown, said she doesn't understand
the ``speedup'' campaign, and neither does the public.
   ``Even so-called rational people are going to be hostile,'' she
said. ``I've heard a lot of people muttering swear words at me
lately. They never did that before.''
   Leaders of Local 6 of the Service Employees International Union
said they wanted to impress upon the public how intransigent the
city has been in labor talks. Among other things, the city wants to
reassign parking enforcement officers' beats, getting rid of a
system with routes assigned by seniority.
   The union is seeking a wage hike of 12 percent, saying the
parking officers are not paid comparably with men holding similar
jobs.
   Parking officers make an average wage of $10 an hour. The city
has offered a 3 percent pay increase.

<HEAD>Iranian Newspaper Blasts Kuwaiti Newspaper on Hostages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radical Iranian newspaper Tuesday
denied a Kuwaiti news report that said the United States and Iran
will normalize relations and that kidnappers in Lebanon could free
their American hostages.
   ``The filthiest accusation against an independent and
revolutionary government is to charge it with being dependent,''
said the editorial in the Farsi-language Jomhuri Islami.
   ``The Islamic republic system in Iran has been the constant
target of propagandistic assaults by the East and the West because
it never gave in to blackmail of anybody or any power or
government.''
   The newspaper was quoted by Iran's official Islamic Republic
News Agency in a dispatch monitored in Cyprus. Jomhuri Islami is
aligned with the radical faction that opposes President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's efforts to improve relations with the West.
   The Kuwaiti daily Al-Seyassah, quoting reliably informed Arab
sources, predicted last Wednesday that a deal between Iran and the
United States would be completed by the end of the year, including
freedom for the hostages and a normalization of relations.
   Like all Kuwaiti newspapers, Al-Seyassah is independent but
basically pro-government. IRNA did not name the ``Kuwaiti
newspaper'' that published ``last week's report,'' but it was
clearly referring to the Al-Seyassah article.
   ``The revolutionary and Moslem nation of Iran continues to
consider the United States as the Great Satan and rejects any ties
with Washington,'' the Iranian newspaper said.
   Kuwait's Al-Seyassah wrote in its front-page story that the
United States already had resumed supplying military aid and
technicians to Iran. There has been no U.S. comment on the report.
   Al-Seyassah wrote that ``the hostage issue has now become an
integral part of a deal, the completion of which could take the
remaining months of the year.''
   ``Hezbollah's extremely difficult conditions could be nothing
more than a political, cosmetic operation that precedes the
normalization of Iranian-U.S. relations and the release of the
hostages,'' the newspaper said.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed to be the umbrella group
for pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups that hold most of the 18
Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Among the conditions the groups have set are: release of 15
Kuwaiti Shiite Moslems held in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and
French embassies; freedom for hundreds of political prisoners in
Israel; a pullout of Israel from a southern Lebanese border strip.
   The hostages are eight Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman.
   Terry Anderson, 42, the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press who was abducted March 16, 1985, is the
longest-held of the hostages. Most of the other hostages have been
held at least three years.
   The English-language Tehran Times, which is aligned with
Rafsanjani, has called for release of the hostages and said 1990
will be the year they are freed. Rafsanjani himself has said he
sees movement toward a solution to the issue of the hostages.
   But the radicals, for whom opposition to the United States is a
touchstone of their policy, oppose any move toward freedom for the
captives.

<HEAD>Absentee Newspaper Owners Put Profit First, Editors Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of the editors of locally and
group-owned newspapers say firms that own multiple newspapers are
more interested in profits than in the communities they serve.
   In a survey, a majority of editors also agreed that freedom of
the press is in more jeopardy when the ownership of papers is
concentrated in fewer hands.
   A committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors took a
fresh look at a frequently debated question among newspeople:
whether newspapers are likely to get better or worse when a local
owner sells the paper to a company owning a number of them.
   Some argue that group ownership brings greater resources to the
local paper; some see homogenization resulting from absentee
ownership.
   The committee's report was prepared for the annual ASNE meeting
which opens Wednesday. Editors of 234 newspapers, half group-owned
and half independent, all with circulations over 10,000, returned
questionnaires.
   One historic characteristic of the American press is its local
nature, but local ownership is a disappearing phenomenon. Fifty
years ago, there were 1,559 independent daily newspapers, locally
owned, edited and managed, and 319 that were part of groups. Now
there are 1,233 group-owned papers and only 389 independents.
   The ASNE committee quoted one editor, David Offer of the
family-owned Newport (R.I.) Daily News, who has worked under both
types of owners, as saying, ``The type of ownership is not nearly
as important as the journalistic commitment of the ownership.''
   Nonetheless, the committee reported sharp distinctions based on
ownership.
   Group-owned papers, it said, were likely to offer ``better
career opportunities, more sharing of ideas, less pressure from
advertisers and special interest groups, greater overall financial
resources and access to outside experts to help solve problems and
train staff.''
   Independent papers, on the other hand, were likely to offer
``larger newsroom budgets, better understanding of (the) local
market, more flexibility in making decisions, greater involvement
in the community, less turnover of key personnel, few levels of
bureaucracy and a tendency to be peculiar.''
   In the survey, 62 percent of editors of group papers and 91
percent of editors of independents agreed that the owners of group
papers ``are more concerned about profits than what happens to
individual newspapers or the communities they serve.'' The same
question was not asked about locally owned papers.
   And 69 percent of groups' editors and 84 percent of independents
agreed that freedom of the press stands in greater jeopardy ``if
the press is owned by few people than if owned by many.''
   But the editors parted company on whether ``newspaper groups, if
left unchecked, will stifle competition and exert undue influence
on the thinking of the whole country.''
   Agreement with that statement came from 73 percent of the
independent editors _ but just 37 percent of those on group-owned
papers.
   Forty-eight percent of groups' editors but only 18 percent of
independents agreed with this statement: ``The sophistication of
newspaper groups is a welcome antidote to the provincialism of
independently owned papers.''
   David Greenfield, editor of the Charleston, W.Va., Daily Mail,
whose independent paper was purchased by a group, Thomson
Newspapers, told the committee little happened with his paper
changed hands. The new owners said ``they want the best newspaper
we can produce,'' he said.
   ``You've got to remember there are a lot of very bad small
newspapers,'' he said. When taken over by a group, ``the bad ones
often get better right away.''
   The report noted that both classes of ownerships vary. Groups
can be owned by private or public corporations that own as few as
two papers or as many as the 83 owned by the Gannett Co., Inc.,
which publishes USA Today and 82 local dailies. Many of the
surviving independents are owned by families but some are owned by
trusts, foundations, local companies or, in a few cases, their
employees.

<HEAD>Dip in Building Permits Cause 1 Percent Decline Economic
Indicators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge plunged 1.0 percent in February, its steepest drop in nine
months, the government said Tuesday. But analysts said the decrease
was misleading.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday its latest Index of Leading
Economic Indicators _ designed to forecast economic activity six to
nine months in advance _ wiped out three months of increases with
the largest decline since a 1.1 percent fall last May.
   But analysts said the report was an aberation caused by a record
25 percent drop in building permits in February from January's 26.8
percent gain as builders took advantage of warm weather and tried
to beat deadlines for new government regulations.
   ``It would have been down just 0.2 percent without the
distorting effect of the building permits,'' said David Jones, an
economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities
dealer in New York.
   Gilbert Benz, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corp. in New
York, said the gauge would bounce back next month to its levels of
late 1989 and early 1990. The index rose 0.1 percent in November,
0.4 percent in December and 0.2 percent in January.
   Nevertheless, seven of the 11 statistics in the index were down
which analysts interpreted as meaning a soft economy, particularly
in the manufacturing sector.
   ``February's leading indicators show a substantial industrial
rebound is unlikely to occur in the next six months,'' said William
K. MacReynolds, forecasting director for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.
   But Jones added, ``Recent signals suggest that while the
goods-producing sector is still flat, it's not getting any worse
and there's no evidence that its weakness is spreading to other
sectors.''
   According to a recent survey of 51 top economists by Blue Chip
Economic Indicators in Sedona, Ariz., the gross national product _
the nation's output of goods and services _ will avoid a recession
and grow 1.7 percent in 1990.
   But the survey concluded that the economic outlook ``remains the
most sluggish since the recession year of 1982.'' The economy grew
3 percent last year, although it slowed to 1.1 percent in the final
quarter.
   In addition to building permits, other statistics contributing
to the index's decline in February were faster business delivery
times, lower stock prices, a decline in plant and equipment orders,
a decrease in the price of raw materials, a decline in the backlog
of manufacturers' unfilled orders and a drop in an index measuring
consumer confidence.
   Three of the components were positive, including an increase in
orders for consumer goods, a gain in the money supply and a drop in
weekly unemployment claims.
   One indicator, the length of the average workweek, was unchanged.
   The various changes left the index at 144.0 percent of its 1982
base of 100. The index fell 0.6 percent from September through
February after declining 0.5 percent the previous six months.

   A group of Lithuanian officials met in Moscow
today with a leading aide to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
heralding a bid to ease the tense stalemate between Moscow and the
breakaway Baltic republic.
   Also today, a Soviet bill on secession cleared one house of
Parliament after heated debate and lawmakers in Estonia passed a
resolution in support of their Baltic neighbor.
   Egidis Bickauskas, a Lithuanian legislator, told a Moscow news
conference that three representatives including Lithuanian Deputy
Premier Romualdas Ozolas met with Alexander N. Yakovlev, considered
to be one of Gorbachev's top advisers.
   ``If there are people who are ready to listen, I think it is
very good,'' Bickaukas said. No results of the meeting were
immediately available.
   The meeting signified the first high-level personal contact
between Lithuania and Moscow since just after the Baltic republic
declared independence on March 11.
   The secession bill was approved by the Soviet of Nationalities,
one of two houses of the parliament, said the official Soviet news
agency Tass, without giving a vote count. It was sent on to the
second chamber, the Soviet of the Union, for possible consideration
later today.
   Some deputies to the Supreme Soviet legislature found the bill
too harsh, while others thought the conditions it set were too
lenient, Tass said.
   An amendment approved by the Soviet of Nationalities requires
any republic leaving the union to pay the costs of citizens who
want to resettle back in the Soviet Union. Lithuania has a large
Russian minority.
   Legislators in the neighboring Baltic republic, Estonia, which
is taking a more cautious approach to independence, approved a
measuring supporting Lithuania and urging Gorbachev to open talks.
   The Estonian Supreme Soviet ``expresses full support of their
strivings, pays high tribute to their courage and expresses
recognition of the independent state organization of Lithuania,''
the declaration said.
   Gorbachev's top deputy spoke of ``friendly ties'' with Lithuania
and said the Kremlin does not question its right to secede _ as
long as it adheres to the constitution.
   The comments by Anatoly I. Lukyanov, chairman of the Supreme
Soviet parliament, came as Lithuanian leaders sought a compromise
that would allow them to start talks with Moscow without giving in
to demands by Gorbachev that they first repeal their March 11
declaration of independence.
   On Monday, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said his
republic intends to move toward independence gradually and through
negotiations. The statement marked something of a retreat from the
recalcitrance that had characterized the Baltic state's three-week
drive for divorce.
   The secession bill would require a two-thirds vote in a
referendum of any republic wishing to leave the Soviet Union. A
five-year transition period would follow during which the republic
and the Kremlin would divide up economic resources and settle any
disputes. In addition, Moscow would have final say over terms of
separation.
   Poland's Foreign Ministry said the Soviet government today
closed the only border crossing between Poland and Lithuania, but
there was no immediate comment by government officials.
   Over the weekend, Soviet soldiers seized Lithuania's chief
prosecutor's office in the capital Vilnius as well as the Baltic
state's main newspaper printing plant. Foreign reporters were
ordered to leave Sunday.
   Kremlin strong-arm tactics aimed at forcing the Lithuanians to
back down have included sending armored vehicles through Vilnius to
rattle the populace, demanding citizens turn in their firearms and
rounding up at least 23 Lithuanians who deserted the Red Army
following the independence declaration.
   Soviet officials say that if Lithuania or any other republic
wants to secede, it needs to follow the law. Gorbachev warned
Saturday that to do otherwise could result in ``grave consequences
for all of us.''
   Lithuania and Estonia, forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in
1940 with fellow Baltic republic Latvia, have declared themselves
to be under illegal Soviet occupation and Lithuanian leaders refuse
to renounce their independence declaration.
   However, Landsbergis said Monday that his republic intends to
``consolidate'' its independence ``by means of agreements and a
gradual takeover of certain functions.''
   In a telegram to Gorbachev, he invited Kremlin officials to
Lithuania to discuss secession.
   Lukyanov, first in line to succeed Gorbachev, said in remarks
carried by Tass late Monday that the Kremlin leadership's attitude
toward Lithuania is ``calm, clear-cut and rather friendly.''
   ``Nobody questions the constitutional right of nations and
peoples to self-determination,'' he said. ``Only this should be
done in legal forms, so that neither to damage the interests of the
nation that has decided to gain self-determination nor of other
nations and ethnic groups inhabiting the Soviet Union.''
   But Lukyanov said Lithuania's ``hasty decision'' ignored its
relationship with the rest of the Soviet Union.
   Landsbergis told legislators Monday that Gorbachev probably took
the tough stance over the weekend because he faces his own
political difficulties from conservatives and other
independence-minded republics.
   ``Therefore it is essential to look for a way of helping them
and ourselves,'' Landsbergis said. Gorbachev faces independence
movements in several of the Soviet Union's 15 republics.
   Virginijus Razmantas of offical Lithuanian radio said the
republic's legislature was today debating whether about 9,000
youths scheduled to report for Soviet military service this spring
should start their service.
   All pro-independence newspapers were printed in the republic's
main printing plant, Razmantas said. A leader of the minority of
Lithuanian Communists who remain loyal to Moscow had told plant
workers Monday that the papers would no longer printed there.
   In Vilnius on Monday, about 1,000 pro-independence demonstrators
rallied outside the chief prosecutor's office to protest the Soviet
occupation.
   Both a prosecutor appointed by Lithuania's breakaway government
and one sent by Moscow were working in the building, employees
said. They reported a tense atmosphere but no direct conflicts
between the two.

   Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin was chosen
Tuesday to succeed senior leader Deng Xiaoping, his sponsor, in a
top military post.
   The National People's Congress accepted Deng's resignation from
his last official government position last week and had been
expected to pick Jiang for the job.
   Jiang was the only candidate. He received 2,682 votes for
chairman of the government Central Military Commission. Ten members
of the parliament voted against him and 26 abstained.
   One deputy wrote in Deng's name and another entered that of
President Yang Shangkun, a general with a strong following in the
military.
   Deng chose Jiang, 63, as his successor. In November, Jiang
replaced him as head of the party Central Military Commission, a
policy-making group with nearly the same membership as the
government body.
   The military has played an increasing political role since June
1989, when soldiers were called in to crush the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing. Holding the two military jobs is crucial to
Jiang's leadership position.
   Jiang, a relatively unknown Shanghai party boss, was named head
of the 48-million-member Communist Party in June after the
dismissal of Zhao Ziyang, who was accused of supporting the
pro-democracy movement.
   He has supported the hard-line policies of Deng and other party
elders. Jiang has no political power base in Beijing.
   Deng, 85, still is considered the most powerful man in China. He
has described Jiang as the ``core'' of next-generation leaders and
asked the military to give the new party chairman their full
support.
   Jiang has no experience in military affairs and the People's
Liberation Army remains dominated by such old revolutionaries as
President Yang, 82, who was named first vice chairman of the party
Central Military Commission in November.
   During vote-counting Tuesday in the Great Hall of the People, a
crowd of deputies gathered around Hu Qili, a former member of the
party Politburo Standing Committee who was purged along with Zhao
for pro-student leanings.
   Deputies extended warm greetings to Hu, asking for his signature
and posing for pictures with him.
   Hu, like Zhao, was stripped of all party posts. He escaped
official criticism, however, and has been allowed to attend a few
public functions.
   Zhao, still a party member and parliamentary deputy, has not
been seen since he went to Tiananmen Square on May 19 for a tearful
meeting with students on hunger strike.

   A Long March 3 rocket will be launched in the
remote hills of Sichuan province Sunday to propel China into the
international satellite market.
   The launching of a U.S.-made telecommunications satellite for
AsiaSat, a Hong Kong-based consortium, is scheduled for the
southwest China rocket base at Xichang.
   It will be almost exactly 20 years since the April 24, 1970
launch of China's first satellite, a 380-pound device that circled
the earth once broadcasting the revolutionary song ``The East Is
Red.''
   Since then, China has successfully put 26 satellites into space
and built a reputation for reliability, which the government hopes
will be the basis for a lucrative launching industry.
   AsiaSat Chairman Wang Jun recently said the $120 million project
will be a major boon to Asian communications. It will be capable of
carrying TV and other telecommunications signals to 2.5 billion
people in 30 Asian countries.
   The 2,750-pound satellite, with a lifespan of about 10 years,
will carry 24 transponders. Burma and two Hong Kong companies have
contracted to use the relay transmitters. Letters of intent have
been signed with Thailand, Pakistan, South Korea, Nepal and other
Asian countries.
   Great Wall Industries, China's government-backed launching
company, said it has also agreed to launch an ArabSat
communications satellite in late 1991 and put two more U.S.-built
satellites into orbit for an Australian firm in 1991 and 1992.
   China is also working on a $150 million earth resources
satellite with Brazil and has a joint project with West Germany to
put a communications satellite in orbit in 1992.
   Setbacks in West Europe's Ariane space program, and the backlog
of space shuttle launches following the 1986 Challenger disaster,
have opened the way for China and others, such as the Soviet Union,
seeking entry into the launching service industry.
   Political turbulence, however, has nearly grounded the Chinese
program. The U.S. Congress in 1988 sought to link the export of
U.S. satellites to ending Chinese missile sales to the Middle East,
and American contractors have demanded guarantees the Chinese will
not price them out of the market.
   The U.S. government in December 1988, after long negotiations,
agreed to grant export licenses for the three Hughes Aircraft
satellites to be launched for AsiaSat and the Australian firm,
AusSat.
   The Chinese agreed to strict safeguards for American technology,
a ceiling of nine international launches over a six-year period and
prices that would not undercut foreign competitors.
   China's government-subsidized service is 30 percent to 50
percent cheaper than comparable Western services. American and
European launchers continue to complain of China's low prices.
   The inaugural launch was nearly scuttled by the military
crackdown on China's pro-democracy movement in June. U.S. sanctions
imposed after June included a ban on satellite exports, and it was
only in December that President Bush waived the restrictions.
   The satellite to be boosted into geostationary orbit 22,300
miles above the equator has made the trip before.
   Formerly known as Westar VI, the satellite was misfired into a
useless orbit during a 1984 space shuttle flight. The next year a
special space shuttle mission retrieved the satellite.

<HEAD>Chinese Dissident Chai Ling Escapes to West</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chai Ling, one of the top student leaders of
last year's pro-democracy movement in Beijing, made a dramatic
television appearance Tuesday to announce her escape to the West
after 10 months as a fugitive in China.
   ``I am now safe and sound,'' said Chai in a near whisper as her
husband, Feng Congde, sat by her side covering his face as he wept.
``Please put your minds to rest.''
   Frequently pausing to fight tears, Chai said, ``The road to
freedom was very difficult, very long. Because of that, as I
reached the last step toward freedom, I almost ran out of energy.
   ``I looked up to see this free world, to breath the fresh air,''
she said.
   The dissident couple were on a wanted list of 21 students
accused by the Chinese Communist authorities of leading the
Tiananmen Square protests last spring. The protests ended June 4 in
a bloody crackdown by troops that left hundreds dead.
   China officially labeled the protests a ``counterrevolutionary
rebellion'' and arrested several of the student leaders.
   Chai, who was nominated for the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize by two
Norwegian legislators, immediately went underground after the
suppression and in a taped message smuggled out of China told of
the military assault on the protesters.
   There had been no confirmed word on her whereabouts since.
   Television Broadcasts Ltd. did not say where the interview was
taped, but two reliable sources said Chai arrived in France this
week after fleeing China.
   Chai, 23, wore a pink shirt and sat at a table with white
flowers and a candle to commemorate those who died in the
pro-democracy movement. She vowed to continue struggling for her
beliefs.
   Near the end of the 10-minute tape, which appeared to have been
filmed in an apartment or hotel room, she said: ``Long live the
motherland. Long live democracy. Eternal glory to the martyrs of
democracy.''
   Chai was among the three most prominent student leaders of last
spring's demonstrations. One leader, Wu'er Kaixi, fled to the West
weeks after the crackdown. The other, Wang Dan, was captured by
Chinese authorities in Beijing.
   Chai's surprise appearance in the West comes nearly a year after
the pro-democracy demonstrations began last April 15.
   Chinese authorities are concerned about any renewed
pro-democracy activities. Authorities sealed off Tiananmen Square
on Sunday.
   Chai was one of the few women in the leadership of the
Autonomous Student Union that led the democracy movement.
   A native of Shandong province and a graduate student in the
Department of Psychology at Beijing Normal University, she assumed
the title ``commander of the headquarters to defend Tiananmen
Square'' before the crackdown.
   The China Times of Taiwan, which first reported Chai's escape,
said she and her husband fled Beijing by train and then hid in
China.

   Imelda Marcos treated the New York branch of the
Philippine National Bank as her ``own personal piggy bank,'' a
federal prosecutor said Tuesday at the start of the embezzlement
case against the former Philippine first lady.
   ``Every time she descended on New York ... she cracked it open,
(taking) bundles and bundles of cash,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
Debra Livingston told jurors.
   ``This case is about theft, fraud and deceit on an incredible
scale,'' she added. Mrs. Marcos helped embezzle millions of dollars
from her homeland's treasury, the prosecutor said, to buy art,
jewelry and Manhattan real estate _ ``things Imelda Marcos
desperately wanted.''
   She described Mrs. Marcos and her late husband as ``partners in
crime.''
   But Mrs. Marcos' lawyer, Gerald Spence, told the jurors in an
impassioned presentation that Mrs. Marcos was in court to defend
Marcos' name. He quoted her as saying to him, ``You cannot do this
to that great man, and I want you to defend him.''
   Mrs. Marcos, who had been blinking back tears for most of the
morning, began crying, wiping the tears away with a black lace
handkerchief.
   Spence said that while he was not going to use an
innocent-spouse defense, he claimed Mrs. Marcos did not understand
the ``intricacies of finance.''
   ``She would say over and over again, `Ferdinand, what is
happening here, what are you doing in this situation?''' Spence
said.
   A lawyer for her co-defendant, Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi,
was set to follow with a preview of his defense strategy.
   The trial in Manhattan's federal court had been in recess since
the 12 jurors were sworn in last Tuesday.
   Prosecutors had said they would present reams of Far East bank
records to prove Mrs. Marcos helped loot her homeland.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, said at the start of jury selection that she
should be tried in her homeland but hoped to be treated as an
ordinary U.S. citizen.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan gave a glimpse of the
government's case in a decision last week in which he let
prosecutors use as evidence thousands of pages of bank records from
Hong Kong, Singapore and the Philippines.
   On the defense side, Spence, said he has 91 Filipino witnesses
who are not being allowed out of the country. He asked that the
witnesses give sworn statements in the Philippines for use at trial.
   The judge has yet to rule on the request.
   Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos were indicted in 1988 on charges
they bought buildings with more than $160 million stolen from the
Philippine treasury and defrauded banks of more than $165 million
to finance the properties.
   Marcos died in exile in September in Hawaii.
   If convicted, Mrs. Marcos could receive up to 50 years in prison
and a $1 million fine. Prosecutors also are seeking forfeiture of
the alleged illegal proceeds.
   Khashoggi, once described as the world's richest man, is accused
of helping the Marcoses hide ownership of four buildings. He is
charged with mail fraud and obstruction and could get up to 10
years in prison and a $500,000 fine.

<HEAD>Bush Plants Elm Tree Dedicated to Ryan White</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush today planted an elm tree in
a downtown park and dedicated it to Ryan White for ``the strength
and bravery'' the youth has shown in his struggle against AIDS.
   ``Let it be Ryan's tree,'' Bush said at the ceremony in
near-freezing temperatures under leaden skies.
   The 18-year-old White was reported in critical condition today
on a life support system at Riley Hospital for Children in
Indianapolis.
   ``He's created a special legacy of his own and he is in our
prayers today,'' Bush said.
   ``He has been fighting a courageous battle against a deadly
disease, but also against ignorance and fear.
   ``Ryan has helped us to understand the truth about AIDS and he's
shown all of us the strength and bravery of the human heart. So
today, as together we plant this beautiful American elm, the symbol
of new life, let it be Ryan's tree.''
   White, a hemophiliac who contracted AIDS from contaminated blood
products, became an international spokesman for victims of the
disease during his five-year battle with it.
   Bush also used the tree-planting to urge the Senate to ``make
America cleaner and safer'' by passing the Clean Air Act.
   As he planted the tree in Washington &amp; Alabama Street Park, Bush
engaged in some last minute, long-distance lobbying on tonight's
Senate vote on the nation's first tougher clean air standards in 13
years. The Senate is expected to pass the compromise Clean Air Act
rewrite.
   ``I am proud of this proposal to cut smog, acid rain and toxic
pollution, to make America cleaner and safer. ... '' Bush said. ``I
urge the Senate to act not merely for this generation but all the
generations to come.''
   During the tree-planting ceremony, Bush praised the Indiana
capital's program to plant 30,000 trees this year and also urged
Congress to pass his own $175 million program to plant 1 billion
trees a year.
   Bush said trees ``renew and restore the natural magic of our
world'' and ``can help ensure clean air.''
   He joked that he has been planting so many trees around the
country ``I might have to open a branch office.''
   The main purpose of the Indianapolis stop was to attend a
fund-raiser for Sen. Dan Coats, who was appointed to fill Dan
Quayle's Senate seat and who is now running for the job in his own
right.
   Bush called his vice president and basketball ``two great
Indiana exports.''
   Before leaving Cincinnati early today, Bush visited the bedside
of a youth shot and paralyzed as an innocent bystander to a
schoolyard fight earlier this year.
   Derrick Turnbow, 17, is a senior honor student at Taft High
School in Cincinnati, which Bush visited in January to attend an
anti-drug rally. Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary,
said Bush told the youth, ``We're very proud of you.''
   Before heading home to the White House tonight, Bush also was
bound for Detroit to help the Michigan GOP fill its political war
chest.
   In Indianapolis, Bush planted the tree in a downtown ``urban
forest,'' before pitching the fortunes of Coats, who will face
Democratic State Rep. Baron P. Hill in the fall election for the
final two years of Quayle's term.
   At a fund-raiser Monday evening for Ohio gubernatorial hopeful
George Voinovich, Bush paused to send his best wishes to Republican
National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater, hospitalized in New York
for intensive radiation treatment of a brain tumor.
   ``During this difficult time ... our hearts go out to him and to
that wonderful family of his,'' said Bush.
   Wishing the 39-year-old GOP chairman ``our very, very best,''
Bush added, ``Right now, there's nothing more important for Lee to
do than to get well, and I know that's exactly what he intends to
do given that fighting spirit.''
   The seat Atwater often occupies on Air Force One on political
trips like this was filled by RNC co-chairman Jeanie Austin. Bush
introduced her to the Ohio crowd, saying, ``Lee is backed up by one
of this party's most able politicians.''

<HEAD>Colombian Arrested With Cocaine Surgically Implanted in Thighs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Customs inspectors at San
Juan's international airport arrested a man from Colombia after
finding a pound of cocaine surgically implanted in his thighs,
officials said Tuesday.
   ``In more than 20 years with the U.S. Customs Service, this is
the most bizarre form of drug-smuggling I have ever encountered or
heard about,'' said Mamie E. Pollack, the agency's district
director.
   Roberto Julian O'Neil, 23, a Colombian citizen, was arrested
Saturday on drug-smuggling charges after arriving at San Juan's
Luis Munoz Marin International Airport on a flight from Bogota, the
Customs Service in Miami said in a statement.
   It said O'Neil was waiting to board a flight to Madrid when he
attracted the attention of a Customs inspector by the stiff-legged
way he walked.
   Inspectors took O'Neil to a private room, where during a
pat-down they discovered what at first they thought to be something
taped to his thighs, the statement said.
   Further examination revealed bulging, badly infected incisions
covered only by strips of adhesive tape, the Customs Service said.
   O'Neil was taken to a hospital, where doctors removed his
stitches and took a half-pound of cocaine from each thigh, the
statement said. It said the cocaine was in four packets, each
containing a quarter pound of cocaine. Each packet was about one
square inch and nearly six inches long.
   Special agent Pablo Rivera in San Juan said O'Neil was still
receiving treatment Tuesday at Rio Piedras Medical Center.
   The Customs Service said inspectors had been watching the
Colombian flight as part of an investigation called ``Operation
Transit Pigeon,'' aimed at intercepting cocaine smuggled through
Puerto Rico to Europe.

   Bus and subway service resumed for
thousands of commuters Tuesday after a financial bailout package
ended a two-day shutdown of Buffalo's mass transit system.
   Ridership was near normal on the Niagara Frontier Transportation
Authority's six-mile subway line and 1,015 miles of bus routes,
even though the system restarted with less than 10 hours' warning.
   The transit agency's board voted Monday night to restart the
system after state and city grants, and accounting changes to speed
up county tax payments to the agency. The payments erased the last
$3.7 million of a $15.6 million budget gap for the fiscal year that
began Sunday.
   Erie County legislators, whose rejection of a transit tax last
week precipitated the crisis, agreed Monday to raise the county's
real estate transfer tax from $4 to $9 per $1,000 of assessed value
and, starting in 1991, to devote a portion of sales tax revenues to
transit.
   In return, the transit agency agreed to raise fares from $1 to
$1.10 and transfers from 5 cents to 20 cents.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
arrived here today for meetings with top U.S. leaders and said
``honest dialogue'' is Moscow's main weapon in dealing with the
independence crisis in Lithuania.
   Speaking to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base, Shevardnadze
said his government believes that it is important to maintain the
integrity of the Soviet Constitution and Soviet laws in the face of
the challenge represented by the Lithuanian independence movement.
   Declaring that Lithuania also approved the Soviet Constitution,
Shevardnadze added: ``We are going to act within the framework of
our Constitution, within the basic law of our country.
   ``Our main weapon in resolving any issue ... is dialogue, honest
dialogue,'' he said and added:
   ``And this is the dialogue we are looking forward to with the
Lithuanian people and the Lithuanian leadership.''
   Meanwhile, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutweiler said
Soviet actions in Lithuania will be ``at the top of the agenda''
when Shevardnadze meets Secretary of State James A. Baker III on
Wednesday. He is set to see President Bush on Friday.
   Baker and Shevardnadze also are likely to discuss _ and perhaps
announce _ a date for the next summit meeting between Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The summit is tentatively planned to be held in Washington
during the second half of June.
   Meanwhile, Lithuania's chief diplomat in the United States said
at a news conference that he would meet Shevardnadze any time
during his U.S. visit.
   But Stasys Lozoraitis Jr. questioned whether Gorbachev is
calling the shots in Lithuania.
   ``Maybe the army is very unhappy with the situation in the
Baltic and is doing something (in Lithuania) that he cannot control
and cannot stop,'' he said.
   Lozoraitis said that while he believes Lithuania will regain its
independence, he is pessimistic now ``because of a feeling that
something is being done that can't have any good results.''
   ``We will wait it out,'' he said. ``We will have very strong
nerves. We will not do anything violent. We will not be provoked.''
   Shevardnadze was to be met at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban
Maryland at midday by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said Monday
that Soviet pressure on Lithuania to annul its month-old
declaration of independence will be raised by Baker in a lengthy
initial session on Wednesday afternoon.
   The issue also is certain to be raised at a meeting between Bush
and Shevardnadze on Friday.
   However, a senior U.S. official said the Lithuania issue would
not crowd other important matters from the agenda.
   The official, who asked not to be identified by name, said these
include strategic and conventional arms control negotiations and
setting a date for the Bush-Gorbachev summit.
   Shevardnadze's talks with Baker and other State Department
officials will intertwine with the visit this week of West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, whose talks are expected
to focus on German reunification.
   In his meetings with Shevardnadze, Baker is expected to express
concern over the Soviet military buildup in Lithuania and such
actions as the seizure of government and Communist Party offices in
Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, and the expulsion of Western
reporters.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Monday the United States does not believe it
should attempt to prescribe ``the precise solution to the
conflict'' in Lithuania.
   She expressed the hope that ``every peaceful means'' will be
explored to resolve the situation and urged that nothing be done by
either side to preclude a dialogue on Lithuania's future.
   The United States has repeatedly called on the Soviets not to
use coercion, intimidation or military force in Lithuania.
   Shevardnadze assured Baker during a meeting in Namibia last
month that the Kremlin would do its utmost to avoid using force to
suppress the independence movement in Lithuania.
   ``They want to solve the problem through dialogue,'' Baker said
in describing the Soviet attitude then. ``There's no reason that we
know of not to take him at his word.''
   ``We have been on the record as saying that the use of force
would be counterproductive and have an adverse impact on our
relations,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   ``It is important that the United States continue to call for
the resolution of this issue through dialogue, through negotiations
in a peaceful manner so that ultimately the people of Lithuania can
indeed enjoy genuine independence,'' she said.

<HEAD>Plastic Surgeons: Loose Lips Need Lifts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tired of seeing the same frowning, hag-like face
staring in the mirror every morning? Plastic surgeons are gathering
to discuss the latest in lifting sagging lips, plumping up puny
ones and fixing a ``witch's chin.''
   Thanks to lift-and-tell celebrities such as Cher, Phyllis Diller
and Joan Rivers, cosmetic surgery is a booming business, said Dr.
James Baker, who teaches at the University of Central Florida at
Orlando.
   ``The demand is growing all the time,'' Baker said Tuesday at
the 23rd annual meeting of the the American Society for Aesthetic
Plastic Surgery.
   Liposuction, the fat-sucking procedure imported from France, is
the most popular technique, with 100,000 operations done each year.
Breast enlargement is a close second, with about 85,000 performed
in 1989, Baker said.
   Softer, more life-like breast implants and details on special
techniques for giving mammograms to women with implants also are on
the agenda at this week's meeting.
   Despite the costs, which range from hundreds to thousands of
dollars and usually aren't covered by health insurance, people who
can afford it will pay to look good, he said.
   ``Cosmetic or appearance things can significantly affect the way
people feel about themselves, so even though some of these things
may seem trivial to outside people, to somebody who has that, it
can make a big difference,'' said Dr. Joel Feldman, a Harvard
Medical School plastic surgeon who has pioneered a way to fix the
``witch's chin.''
   The term refers to a protrusion of skin at the chin's tip that
becomes pronounced when a person smiles. It is more common in older
people, but Feldman said he's treated younger people and even
teen-agers.
   ``I had one patient who said when she was a young girl and
baby-sitting, one of the kids said to her, `You look like a witch,'
'' he recalled.
   Feldman's technique involves removing the soft protruding
tissue, using an incision that is hidden by the shadow of the chin.
   Previous techniques ``have tried to correct this problem by
repositioning the soft tissue,'' he said. ``I've found that
repositioning is prone to undercorrection, or sagging as time goes
on.''
   Feldman said his procedure is a simpler, more lasting solution.
It costs about $2,500.
   For folks with drooping mouths, perpetual frowns also associated
with aging, there's the ``lip lift.''
   As people get older, the upper lip gets longer and the corners
of the lip turn down, ``into almost a comma shape,'' said Dr.
Bernard Cohen, a University of Pittsburgh plastic surgery professor.
   ``It always looks sad, no matter what they feel inside,'' Cohen
said.
   While more common techniques such as chemical peels have been
used to fix fine frown lines beside the mouth, none addressed
actually lifting the lips until a few years ago, Cohen said.
   It involves excising a small diamond-shaped patch of skin at the
corners of the mouth. The technique draws up the lips into a more
neutral position.
   ``You're literally elevating the corners of the mouth,'' said
Cohen, who estimates he and his former partner have lifted 275 lips
in recent years.
   The procedure is often done in conjunction with total face
lifts, but alone it costs up to $600, he said.
   Another lip enhancer is billed as a possible permanent solution
to the problem of thin lips, and an alternative to collagen
injections made famous by actress Barbara Hershey in the movie
``Beaches.''
   It involves cutting flaps of lip skin from the inside of the
mouth and lifting them forward to the lip line. The procedure
creates fullness by advancing some of the lining and muscle inside
the lip, according to Dr. M. Reza Samiian, chief of plastic surgery
at Baptist Medical Center in Jacksonville, Fla.
   ``The results can be considered permanent because the materials
used to build up the lip are part of its basic structure,'' said
Samiian, who is to report on the technique Friday.

   Ryan White, the teen-age AIDS patient whose
battle for acceptance won hearts and better understanding of the
disease across the nation, remained in critical condition today on
a life-support system, his physician said.
   Dr. Martin B. Kleiman said late this morning that White, 18, was
unconscious and heavily sedated so that life-support systems would
function more efficiently. There was no significant change in his
condition overnight, he said.
   While agreeing that his condition was critical, he called
reports Monday of massive internal bleeding ``exaggerated and
obviously in error,'' and said his top concern was treating White's
respiratory infection.
   ``Anybody who's this critically ill _ nobody can predict from
moment to moment if he will survive,'' he said.
   White, who during his five-year battle with AIDS grew from an
object of scorn in his hometown to an international spokesman for
AIDS patients, has been hospitalized at Riley Hospital for Children
since Thursday.
   White's mother, Jeanne White, and sister, Andrea, slept some
during the night in a room near him.
   On Monday, Carrie Van Dyke, a spokewoman for White's family and
for the Indiana State Board of Health, had said that White was
``not expected to come out of it.'' The hospital was soon inundated
with calls from well-wishers.
   Van Dyke said this morning that singer Elton John visited the
hospital overnight, flying in from Los Angeles, and singer Michael
Jackson had called.
   She said John spent five hours with the family and ``just raised
their spirits tremendously, that someone of his stature would care
so much to drop everything.''
   When Jackson called, a speaker phone was brought to White's
bedside in hopes he would somehow hear Jackson's words.
   ``He told Ryan he loved him and that God is with him,'' Van Dyke
said. ``And he said, `Hang in there, buddy, and get better.'''
   Mary Maxwell, a spokesman for the hospital, said the flood of
calls ``has bedlam. We're getting calls from every small town in
the United States. It hasn't let up. Callers want Mrs. White to
know she has their support and prayers.''
   President Bush, who was in Indianapolis for a political
fund-raising event, had hoped to stop at the hospital to visit the
family, but was not able to work it into his schedule. He did plant
a tree in White's honor in during a ceremony at a downtown park.
   ``Ryan has helped us understand the truth about AIDS, and he's
shown all of us the strength, bravery of the human heart,'' Bush
said.
   White, a hemophiliac who contracted AIDS from contaminated blood
products, put a youthful face on the AIDS plight. He increased
awareness of the disease and helped reinforce the message that AIDS
cannot be spread through casual contact. His struggle was the
subject of a People magazine cover story and a TV movie.
   ``Because of the lack of education on AIDS discrimination, fear,
panic and lies surrounded me,'' White told a teachers convention in
1988.
   ``I was labeled a troublemaker, my mom an unfit mother, and I
was not welcome anywhere. ... Even at church, people would not
shake my hand,'' he said.
   He urged the teachers to ``help me beat the odds and together
let's educate and save the children of the world. ... By proper
education, AIDS can be a disease, not a dirty word.''
   Five years ago, White, who was diagnosed as having AIDS at 13,
was barred from school near Kokomo by officials who feared AIDS
could be transmitted to other students.
   Even after a judge affirmed White's right to attend school, he
and his family felt ostracized and moved about 20 miles away in
Cicero, where they were welcomed by the community.
   White's battle with AIDS sent him to Washington to testify
before Congress and to California for star-studded fund-raisers. He
gained the support of Jackson, John and other entertainers.
   Last week, Ryan appeared with former President and Nancy Reagan
at a pre-Oscar party in Los Angeles for sick and disadvantaged
youth sponsored by Athletes and Entertainers for Kids. The
organization has established the Ryan White National Education
Program for Youth, an AIDS education forum.
   ``Ryan is a very courageous young man who has a special place in
our hearts,'' the Reagans said in a statement Monday.
   White has symbolized not just the tragedy of AIDS, but also the
ignorance of society toward the disease, said Cleve Jones, founder
of the NAMES Project. The group has sponsored the creation of a
nationwide AIDS memorial quilt.
   ``If this is the end for him, I hope the people of this country
derive some lesson from the obstacles he faced and the
determination that he and his family showed to overcome those
obstacles, that he had to defeat more than an illness,'' Jones said
in a telephone interview from San Francisco. ``I think that's
something this country should be ashamed of.''
   White had suffered from an inoperable hernia since before
Thanksgiving and stopped attending class at Hamilton Heights High
School before Christmas.
   Linda Otto, who produced the ABC-TV movie based on White's life,
said she has always been touched by his battle for his life and the
rights of AIDS patients.
   ``The point I would like to get across is how incredibly Ryan
reached out to other children with this disease,'' Otto said. ``He
was selfless and he really made an effort.''
   White had a cameo role in the film, which was first broadcast in
January 1989. He portrayed his own friend who later died of AIDS.
   White's parents, Jeanne and Wayne, are divorced.

<HEAD>Ailing Honecker Moved to Soviet-run Sanitorium, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted Communist leader Erich Honecker was
moved to a Soviet-run sanitorium Tuesday after his health worsened,
a West German newspaper reported.
   A Soviet military convoy escorted the 77-year-old ex-leader and
his wife, Margot, to the sanitorium outside East Berlin from a
nearby parish house where they were staying, the newspaper Bild
said.
   Bild said Honecker, who is suffering from kidney cancer, asked
to be moved. It said without attribution that Honecker's health has
deteriorated.
   The move came slightly more than a week after Honecker and his
wife were forced to abandon their new home.
   They moved had from a Lutheran Church parish house on March 23
to a better-equipped government residence near Neuruppin, about 50
miles away.
   They returned to the church refuge after just one night because
protesters gathered outside the residence and created a ``dangerous
situation,'' a government spokesman said.
   The Lutheran Church has been sheltering Honecker since Jan. 30
and church officials agreed with the government that he should move
to more comfortable surroundings for health reasons.
   Honecker was ousted in October after 18 years in power by a
pro-democracy movement that also led to the opening of East
Germany's borders and free elections in March.
   The former leader is being investigated on charges of corruption
and abuse of power. Government officials have said a medical team
will examine him to determine his fitness to stand trial, so it's
possible he will not be prosecuted.
   Honecker was imprisoned two days in January but was freed
because of his health.
   The church gave Honecker shelter because no one else wanted to
take him, the parsonage said. The couple that runs the parish,
Sigrid and Thoms Holmer, say they have received death threats.
   Bild telexed copies of its report on Honecker to other news
organizations in advance of Wednesday's scheduled publication.

   When Hurricane Hugo battered this
island community it uncovered well-preserved Civil War artifacts
including smoking pipes, leather boots and wooden buttons from a
Union camp, officials said.
   The site, which was kept a secret since the Sept. 21 storm in an
effort to keep vandals away, was shown to reporters Monday as part
of Duke University geologist Orrin Pilkey's field trip to assess
damage from the hurricane.
   ``The exceptional thing about the site is the preservation seems
to be superb. We rarely ever get wood,'' said Martha Zierden,
curator of historical archaeology at the Charleston Museum.
   Other artifacts unearthed by the storm included a piece of a
wooden scrub brush, bullets, bottles, ink wells, wooden buttons and
barrels and salted pork.
   ``These provide insight into day-to-day living,'' said Gered
Lennon, a geologist for South Carolina Coastal Council and Folly
Beach resident, who discovered the site.
   The items had been buried under 2 feet of sand.
   Lennon said he was concerned about vandals disturbing the site,
and noted that police are checking the area regularly.
   The area, about 100 yards long, likely was used as to store
Union munitions and food, Lennon said.
   Excavation of the site is on hold while federal officials review
a permit application, Ms. Zierden said.
   Thousands of Union soldiers used Folly Beach as a winter
encampment during the bombardment of Fort Sumter at the start of
the Civil War and the siege of Charleston.
   Last year, relic hunters discovered the vestiges of a long-lost
regimental hospital cemetery during excavation for a road in a
heavily wooded area of a housing development.
   Archaeologists from the University of South Carolina eventually
uncovered 19 human skeletons. They concluded the men were black,
apparently died of diseases rampant at the time and were members of
the 54th and 55th Massachusetts regiments and the 1st North
Carolina Colored Infantry Regiment.
   The remains of the men were reburied last May at Beaufort
National Cemetery.

   Willie Musarurwa, a veteran journalist
who spent 10 years in jail for his political activities, died
Tuesday of an apparent heart attack, hospital officials said.
   Musarurwa, 62, collapsed at a lunch attended by U.S. Ambassador
Steven Rhodes. Rhodes had arrived a few hours earlier to take up
his first foreign diplomatic posting.
   A hospital spokesman said Musarurwa apparently suffered a heart
seizure.
   Musarurwa was jailed without trial for 10 years because of
political activism against white minority rule before Zimbabwe's
independence in 1980.
   He was fired from his job as chief editor of Zimbabwe's main
Sunday newspaper in 1985 after President Robert Mugabe accused him
of being overly critical of the government.
   ``We are all deeply shocked. Willie was one of the major figures
in Zimbabwean life,'' said an American Embassy spokesman.

   Divorced people are apparently undeterred by
their experience, heading for the altar at higher rates than single
folks, a new government report says.
   There were 807 marriages for every 10,000 divorced women in
1987, the National Center for Health Statistics reported. That
compared to 589 marriages per 10,000 single women.
   Among men, the marriage rate was 1,157 per 10,000 divorced men,
compared to 488 for single ones, the center said.
   ``People who do things tend to do them again, movers move,
marriers marry,'' Barbara Foley Wilson, a population analyst at the
center, said Tuesday.
   People who are divorced ``are people who obviously were
marriage-prone to begin with. They are used to living in a coupled
fashion,'' she said.
   In addition, many divorced women have children and ``may be
interested in having help raising them,'' she said.
   Another factor, she added, is the possibility that divorced
people are marrying someone with whom a relationship developed
before the end of their first marriage.
   Some people don't remarry following a divorce, but for many the
first marriage was not a totally bad experience and so they look
for a new spouse, she said. ``I think marriage is a hopeful thing.''
   Wilson pointed out that over the years there has been a steady
growth in what she called ``partil'' remarriages in which one
partner was previously married.
   Marriages involving single women and divorced men increased from
6.9 percent of all marriages in 1970 to 11.0 percent in 1987. Those
involving single men and previously divorced women rose from 6.4
percent to 10.4 percent of marriages over the same period.
   And over that time span marriages involving two previously
divorced people rose from 10.7 percent to 19.1 percent of marriages
across the country.
   The report, although for 1987, provides the most current
detailed information on marriages, which declined to just over 2.40
million in that year. Preliminary totals have disclosed a further
drop to 2.39 million in 1988 with an apparent leveling off in 1989.
   Divorced women were the only major segment to show an increase
in marriage rates from 1986 to 1987, the report said. The rate
increased from 795 to 807.
   Marriage rates for single and widowed women and for all segments
of the male population fell, the study said. The figures were based
on people aged 15 and over.
   In other findings:
   _For men the median time between divorce and remarriage was 2.2
years, while divorced women had a median time of 2.5 years before
remarriage. Median means that half married sooner than that and
half later.
   _The median age at first marriage was 25.3 years for men and
23.6 years for women, the 13th consecutive year of increase.
   _Grooms tended to be older than brides, on average, except in
the case of divorced or widowed women who married single men.
   _Couples embarking on their first marriage tended to have
roughly similar educational backgrounds. Women averaged 13.7 years
of schooling, while men had 13.6 years.
   _In remarriages, men tended to have slightly more education than
their brides, 13.4 years compared to 13.1 years.
   In those cases, said Wilson, the wives likely married and had
children while young and were unable to pursue educations. Thus,
when they divorce and remarry, they are likely to have had less
education that their new husband.
   _June was the month in which most marriages occur and Saturday
the most popular day.
   In most years the last Saturday in June is the peak day of the
year. However, in in 1987 Valentine's Day, Feb. 14, fell on a
Saturday and was the top day for marriage that year, with 46,000
weddings.
   The report is based on data provided to the Center for Health
Statistics by state governments. Marriage totals cover all states.
   However, eight states do not provide detailed data on the
characteristics of people marrying. Those are Arizona, Arkansas,
Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas and Washington.

   Public comment will be accepted for 60 days.

<TEXT>
   Israel sent its second experimental satellite
into orbit Tuesday and showed off its advanced rocket technology at
a time of rising Middle East tensions.
   Israel denied the Ofek-2 satellite was part of a program to spy
on its Arab neighbors, but Israeli leaders boasted that the launch
showed the country's scientific and military superiority over Arab
countries.
   Military analysts have long noted that Israel's space program
could give it immediate intelligence on Arab military moves and the
rocket technology involved also could carry more lethal payloads.
   Witnesses said the rocket that hefted the 352-pound satellite
into space lifted off at 3:02 p.m. (8:02 a.m. EDT), rising slowly
above a ball of orange flame and leaving a trail of white smoke.
   The Ofek-2 _ ``Ofek'' is Hebrew for ``horizon'' _ was launched
from an undisclosed site in the center of the country and entered
orbit 90 minutes later.
   It was fired westward over the Mediterranean to avoid giving
Arab countries a look at the rocket. Despite the secrecy of the
launch, civilians including a busload of school children stopped to
watch the rocket arch into partly cloudy skies.
   Israeli officials refused to discuss the rocket involved in the
launch.
   The satellite's orbit will range from 130 miles at its lowest
point to 923 miles at its highest, according to Israel Aircraft
Industries, which developed the satellite.
   The launch came a day after President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
threatened to react to any Israeli assault on his country with a
chemical warfare attack that would ``make fire eat half of Israel.''
   But Israel Space Agency director Yuvaal Neeman denied the
long-rumored launch was a response to the Iraqi warning.
   ``We don't send satellites because of threats,'' he said.
   He described the new satellite as experimental and similar to
the Ofek-1 launched aboard a three-stage rocket Sept. 19, 1988.
   ``The only difference is that we can call the satellite and send
it messages and receive answers back,'' Neeman said, adding: ``It
is not a spy satellite and has no military significance.''
   Neeman said on Israel television that Ofek-2 would remain in
orbit for two months, adding there is ``no reason for it to stay
longer because it has no real purpose.''
   Ofek-1 remained four months in orbit although it was scheduled
to spend only a month in space.
   Neeman said Tuesday's launch was expected to lead to a third
test launch in 1992 and an eventual communications satellite that
would remain in space for 10 years.
   The purpose of the program is to build a scientific satellite
``to see stars, galaxies ... and black holes, with detectors for
X-rays, ultraviolet rays,'' said Akiva Bar-Nun, the space agency's
coordinator.
   He and Neeman said the advances in Ofek-2 over the previous
craft included an improved gyroscope, better protection against
cosmic rays, a larger computer memory and the ability to both send
and receive messages.
   While space officials always discuss the Ofek program in terms
of scientific and commericial possibilities, Israeli politicians
were quick to point out the political and military significance of
Tuesday's launch.
   ``I think the proof for the high level of technology in Israel
was given today, with the launching of Ofek-2,'' Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens said on Israel television.
   ``I think the Israeli public knows that Israel's security
technology is on a much higher level than that or Iraq,'' added
Arens, a former defense minister.
   Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader who has been picked to form
Israel's new government, told reporters the launch should remind
Iraq's president ``that if he wants to deal with Israel, he should
look for other means than the military one.''
   After the launch of the first satellite in 1988, foreign reports
said Israel used a modified version of the Jericho II rocket and
the lift-off demonstrated Israel's ability to use medium-range
missiles.
   Ron Ben-Ishai, the military analyst for the daily Yediot
Ahronot, wrote at the time that putting a satellite in orbit meant
ability to use the rocket to hit targets on land.
   The Washington Post last year quoted a report from the U.S.
government's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as saying the
1988 launch provided evidence that Israel ``probably had a
capability of building a ballistic missile with a range over over
2,800 miles and carrying a payload of over 2,200 pounds.''

   Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin announced
today she will not seek a fourth term as governor.
   ``It is time for me to move on to new challenges,'' the governor
said this morning, fighting back tears as she revealed her closely
held decision.
   In a speech before about 200 Cabinet members, lawmakers and
supporters, Kunin, a Democrat, said she was proud of her record on
the environment, education, human services and keeping Vermont's
budgets in balance.
   She gave special attention to the progress she said her three
terms as governor represented for women.
   ``We have made history here in Vermont. We have shown that women
are strong and capable leaders. ... We are tough, we are
compassionate and we are fine managers of the public trust,'' Kunin
said to prolonged applause.
   The decision immediately gave front-runner status to former Gov.
Richard Snelling, a Republican, who was Kunin's predecessor.
   Snelling served four terms as governor before opting not to run
in 1984. In that election, Kunin narrowly defeated then-Attorney
General John Easton to become the state's first woman governor.
   Kunin, 56, had been unsure whether she would run this year, at
times saying she was leaning in favor of running, at times backing
off from such a statement. She was elected to the first of her
three two-year terms in 1984.
   Earlier, she had said her decision would come at the end of the
legislative session, which is still several weeks away.
   The decision will leave Democrats scrambling to find a
candidate. The most likely ones are Lt. Gov. Howard Dean and former
state Sen. Peter Welch, a Democrat from Windsor.
   ``I'm glad she made the decision because it will be easier for
somebody else to make a decision at this point,'' said State
Democratic Party Chairwoman Vi Coffin, adding she was ``sad and
disappointed'' that Kunin had decided not to seek reelection.
   Kunin has had a rough third term, with state revenues falling
and the prospects of deficits rising. She has also seen herself
become the object of attacks from those who feel she has too
strongly pushed state initiatives.
   Kunin, a onetime journalist and college instructor, served five
years in the state House of Representatives in the 1970s. From 1979
to 1982, she was lieutenant governor.
   Kunin said she planned to write a book and devote more time to
her personal life away from what she said was an 80- or
90-hour-a-week job as governor.
   ``I want to write a book. I want to develop new ideas and
strategies on global environmental issues. And I want to continue
to inspire women to reach their full capacity.''
   She said she agonized over her decision on whether to seek
another term. ``Power is difficult to release voluntarily. It is
also difficult to walk away from a fight.

<HEAD>Family Mistakes Wounded Boy For Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Carmen Camarillo pleaded with doctors
not to unhook the life-support machines before learning the boy she
had cried over was not her son.
   ``The doctor came in and told me my son was brain dead and the
only thing that was going right now was a respirator,'' she said.
``It was awful.''
   Family members gathered in the street Friday night were
convinced the wounded boy was 17-year-old Bonafacio Camarillo. They
confirmed the identity to hospital staff.
   ``I saw him myself,'' Mrs. Camarillo said. ``It was my son.''
   They were mistaken.
   The boy they'd found bleeding in the street with a gunshot wound
to the head was 15-year-old Jose Soto.
   Bonafacio was at a friend's house at the time of the shooting,
unaware of the confusion until he showed up at his house a little
while later. His grandmother and aunt, thinking him a ghost, ran.
   ``They were scared,'' Camarillo said. ``They thought I was
dead.''
   The two women loaded him into a car and drove him to hospital to
show family members that Bonafacio was still alive. No one believed
it at first.
   ``My husband came in and told me my son was outside and I said
he was crazy, too,'' Mrs. Camarillo said. ``I had seen my son and
he was dead.''
   The Soto family, which has since taken over the vigil at the
teen-ager's bedside, was appreciative of the attention paid by the
Camarillo family.
   ``At least somebody was with him,'' said Soto's cousin, Rosa
Felix. ``Maybe if he was unconscious, he was thinking it was his
mom with him.''
   Soto, who was listed in critical condition Tuesday, was shot as
he ran from a party where he had been involved in an argument, said
Senior Sheriff's Deputy Richard Dixon. Deputies on Monday arrested
two youths in connection with the shooting.

   Robert Alton Harris came within 12 hours of
the gas chamber but said only ``Oh, thanks'' after the U.S. Supreme
Court refused to allow California's first execution in 23 years, a
prison spokesman says.
   The court Monday voted 6-3 against lifting a stay of execution
issued by a federal judge last week. The ruling sent the double
murderer's case back to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
which today agreed to a speeded-up hearing in the case.
   ``His reaction was very calm,'' San Quentin Prison spokesman Lt.
Cal White said Monday. ``He just said `Oh, thanks,' and remained
very calm.''
   ``Family visiting him jumped up and embraced him, some even
cried,'' White added. ``But he remained very calm throughout the
whole thing.''
   Harris, 37, was sentenced to die for the 1978 kidnap and murder
of two 16-year-olds whose car he stole to use in a $3,000 bank
robbery. He would have been the first person put to death in
California since 1967, and death-penalty opponents had feared his
execution would open the floodgates on capital punishment.
   The ruling pleased those opponents and frustrated prosecutors
and relatives of Harris' victims.
   Kathryn Mayeski Sanders, the mother of victim John Mayeski,
said: ``We see how the justice system works. The execution should
have happened 11 years ago.''
   ``Everybody protects the criminals, but what about us?'' asked
Linda Herring of Escondido, Calif., sister of victim Michael Baker.
   Harris was to have died at 3 a.m. today, but federal appeals
Judge John Noonan halted the execution on Friday, citing arguments
that Harris did not get adequate psychiatric help at his trial.
Harris claims to have mental disorders stemming from childhood
abuse.
   Prosecutors immediately asked the Supreme Court to lift the stay
of execution, arguing that Harris had the help of two distinguished
psychiatrists.
   While the Supreme Court turned that request down, the appeals
court today granted Attorney General John Van de Kamp's request to
speed up its normal schedule for the case. The appeals court
ordered a hearing May 14. Harris' lawyers, who normally would have
45 days for their first written arguments, must present them by
April 13.
   There is no deadline for the court's ruling, however.
   Gov. George Deukmejian, who as a state senator wrote the death
penalty law, lashed out at an ``incompetent federal judicial
system.''
   But death penalty opponents, who had planned a vigil outside the
prison gates to protest the execution, turned the event into a
celebration. About 300 people smiled as they referred to the
court's decision to spare ``Bobby.''
   Vigil leader Stephen Souza, who spent 33 nights outside the
prison to protest capital punishment, called the court's decision
``a small victory in the struggle for human rights and abolition of
the death penalty.''
   ``I feel for the families of John Mayeski and Michael Baker,''
he said. ``I know they are hurting, but if we were to execute
Robert Harris, it would do nothing to bring them back.''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Anthony M. Kennedy voted to let Harris die.

   An annual survey shows a scant increase this
year in the percentage of American newspaper reporters, editors and
photographers who are members of racial minorities.
   The American Society of Newspaper Editors survey, made public
Tuesday, said members of racial minorities make up 7.86 percent of
the newsroom workforce, an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent
over last year.
   When the ASNE's annual survey on minority employment started in
1978, blacks, Hispanics, Asians and American Indians constituted
3.95 percent of the news staffs. The figure has risen gradually
each year.
   ASNE President Loren Ghiglione, editor of the Southbridge
(Mass.) News, said this year's increase actually represented a
setback since the number of minorities in the overall population
probably grew at a faster pace.
   ``In these tough economic times, perhaps any increase in the
percentage of people of color should be applauded,'' Ghiglione said.
   But Merv Aubespin, chairman of the ASNE Minorities Committee,
said the slight gain was ``embarrassing for our industry, which
prides itself on putting the spotlight on the ills of society.''
   ``Newspapers' survival depend on serving a changing
constituency, and minority journalists are essential to that
effort,'' Aubespin said.
   ASNE has adopted a goal of making newsroom staffs equivalent to
the racial diversity of society as a whole by the year 2000. An
estimated 16 percent of Americans are non-white.
   An indication that newspapers were trying to close the gap came
in the survey's finding that 19 percent of entry-level journalists
were members of a racial minority. Last year the figure was 18
percent.
   The survey said minorities make up 4.6 percent of newsroom
supervisors, 8 percent of copy editors, 8.7 percent of reporters
and 10.7 percent of photographers.
   All told, the nation's 1,642 dailies employ 4,467 members of
minorities out of a total work force of 56,884.
   Papers with no minority editorial staff members constituted 56
percent of all dailies in 1987, 55 percent in 1988 and 54 percent
in 1989 and 1990.
   Most of the newspapers with only whites were smaller papers and
most were in the Midwest, where fewer minorities live, the survey
showed. They represent only 18 percent of total U.S. newspaper
circulation.
   Editors of small papers in parts of the country with few
minority residents have said they rarely receive applications from
non-whites.
   Nearly half of the participating newspapers agreed to make their
responses public. Of those, these papers had news staffs of at
least 20 percent minorities:
   Fallon Lahontan Valley (Nev.) News and Eagle Standard, 50;
Brownsville (Texas) Herald, 45.5; Grenada (Miss.) Daily
Sentinel-Star, 40; Honolulu (Hawaii) Advertiser, 33.7; Harlingen
Valley Morning Star 32.1; Visalia (Calif.) Times-Delta, 32;
Palestine (Texas) Herald-Press, 27.3; Santa Clarita Newhall
(Calif.) Signal and Enterprise, 26.7; Lamar (Colo.) Daily News, 25;
Newport (Ark.) Daily Independent, 25; Oakland (Calif.) Tribune, 25;
Wailuku Maui (Hawaii) News, 22.7; Vineland (N.J.) Daily Journal,
22.7; Greenville (Texas) Herald Banner 22.2; Tucson (Ariz.)
Citizen, 21.7; Orangeburg (S.C.) Times and Democrat, 21.4; Houma
(La.) Daily Courier, 21.4; Salinas (Calif.) Californian 20.8;
Clinton (Mo.) Democrat, 20; Claremore (Okla.) Progress, 20; Texas
City (Texas) Sun, 20; Sitka (Alaska) Daily Sentinel, 20; Tracy
(Calif.) Press, 20.
   Another survey made public in connection with the society's
annual meeting said 14 percent of the news sources quoted on the
front pages of 20 newspapers during one month were women. A survey
of the same papers a year ago found 11 percent of quoted sources
were women.
   The survey on the appearance of women in photos and bylines and
as news sources on front pages was commissioned by the ASNE Human
Resources Committee and the University of South California's Media
Watch: Women and Men, associated with feminist Betty Friedan.
   It showed that women's bylines appeared on an average of 28
percent of stories in the 10 large and 10 smaller newspapers in the
survey. Last year, women's bylines appeared over 27 percent of
stories.
   Women were featured in 32 percent of photos this year, compared
with 24 percent last year.
   Editors of surveyed newspapers were asked to comment.
   ``I am damned if I can see what conclusions should be drawn from
your findings; the wisdom of the ages appears to cry out for
silence,'' said Ben Bradlee of The Washington Post.
   Janet Chusmir, executive editor of The Miami Herald, said, ``We
aren't happy with the representation of women in our news pages,
bylines or supervisory positions. Frankly, no newspaper in the
country should be.''
   But she added: ``While my fellow editors and I can make changes
in our staffs, our bylines, our commitment to pluralistic coverage,
we can't change the gender of the male public figures in this
country.''
   Tom Kelsch, surveying the photos on the front pages of his
paper, the Sun-Journal of Lewiston, Maine, expressed gratitude for
the election of Violeta Chamorro as president of Nicaragua. ``Thank
heavens for Chamorro,'' he noted, ``or we might have been washed
out completely.''

<HEAD>South African Patrols Try to Stop Factional Fighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers and police in armored
vehicles patrolled on Tuesday in Natal province, where a week of
black factional fighting has killed scores of people.
   Black leader Nelson Mandela said his supporters doubted the
neutrality and effectiveness of the security forces.
   Armored patrols moved through Edendale Valley in the
southeastern province, where a 4-year-old battle for supremacy
between two rival black groups has grown to virtual civil war.
   Police said at least 55 people had been killed in the past week.
University of Natal researchers put the death toll at 80 and
accused Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu group, of ``a
systematic, coordinated and concerted onslaught.''
   Another police report Tuesday said 13 more people had been
killed, most of them in black factional fighting elsewhere in the
country, but gave few details.
   The struggle in Natal is between Inkatha, headed by Zulu
homeland leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and supporters of Mandela's
African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   After a two-dy visit to troubled black townships in Natal,
Mandela said Tuesday it was ``encouraging to see'' President F.W.
de Klerk ``concerned about the situation.''
   He added, however: ``Unilateral action by the government without
consulting acknowledged (black) leaders is bound to be ineffective,
regardless of merit.''
   De Klerk and Mandela are scheduled to meet Thursday about ways
to stop the worst outbreak of violence in South Africa since the
mid-1980s. Hundreds of people have been killed in the past two
months.
   Mandela said many of his supporters believe the police support
Inkatha.
   ``There is a deeply entrenched perception that the police are
directly involved in the violence that is raging in this
province,'' he said.
   About 4,000 people have been killed in Natal since 1986, but
there have been few prosecutions. Most neutral observers have
blamed both Inkatha and ANC supporters for the violence.
   The University of Natal researchers claimed Inkatha was
responsible for the latest fighting. They said more than 2,000
``Inkatha warriors'' took part in one attack last week.
   Mandela defended the ANC decision to cancel April 11 peace talks
with the government. The cancellation was to protest the killing of
at least 11 blacks when police fired on demonstrators March 26 at
Sebokeng, a township south of Johannesburg.
   If whites had been killed, ``white South Africa would be
screaming at the top of its voice, but because it's blacks, whites
think it is not important,'' he said.
   More than 12,000 refugees, most of them women and children, have
fled the Edendale area and are being sheltered in camps, police
reported. They said rival mobs had burned hundreds of houses in the
area.
   Civil servants continued strikes Tuesday in the Gazankulu and
Venda black homelands. Officials in Gazankulu said 29 people were
killed and more than 200 huts burned during unrest last month.
   On Monday, de Klerk ordered a major effort by security forces to
end the violence in Natal and elsewhere.
   Measures include reinforcing army and police units, setting up
roadblocks, arresting more people and arranging for extra courts to
handle cases related to the unrest.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC and other outlawed black opposition
groups in February and released Mandela, who had spent 27 years in
prison.

<HEAD>20,000 Australians To Die This Year From Smoking, Conference Told</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PERTH, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government study released Tuesday said
20,000 Australians will die this year from diseases related to
smoking, an increase of more than 10 percent in three years.
   ``Tobacco is the leading addictive substance causing death and
premature mortality in Australia,'' said the study by the Health
Department of the state of Western Australia.
   The study was released at the opening of the seventh World
Conference on Smoking and Health. It also said 9,652 smokers in
Australia will develop cancer this year and that 100,000 others
will be hospitalized with other health problems.
   Australians will lose 100,000 premature years of life from
smoking in 1990 alone, the study said.
   Federal Health Minister Dr. Neal Blewett, among 800 experts from
70 countries at the conference, said 18,000 Australians died during
1987 as a direct result of smoking. The figure represents 71
percent of all drug-caused deaths, he said.
   In a keynote address at the four-day conference, Blewett said
lung cancer caused by cigarette smoking is set to overtake breast
cancer as the most common form of malignancy among Australian women
by the early 1990s.
   He said that while lung cancer mortality rates among men had
fallen over the last 30 years, the death rate among women continued
to rise.
   Blewett said Australia was at the forefront of the battle
against tobacco, which led the Labor government of Prime Minister
Bob Hawke to ban smoking in all federal buildings, federally
controlled hospitals and on domestic flights.

   Lithuania's chief diplomat said Tuesday he
believes the Soviet army may have taken the lead role from Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in dealing with his country's
independence crisis.
   Stasys Lozaraitis Jr., told a news conference that the Soviet
military show of force in Lithuania has made him more pessimistic
than before about his country's fate and added:
   ``Maybe the army is very unhappy with the situation in the
Baltic and is doing something he cannot control and cannot stop,''
Lozaraitis said, referring to the closing of Lithuania's borders
with Poland, the seizure of government offices and the buildup of
troops and armored vehicles.
   ``I don't know if Mr. Gorbachev is really in control of these
actions,'' he said.
   Lozaraitis, who is Lithuania's envoy in the United States, has
been made his country's ambassador-at-large. He has been authorized
to act for the Lithuanian parliament if it has been silenced.
   During a news conference at the former Lithuanian Embassy here,
Lozaraitis said he is disappointed with Western Europe's lukewarm
support for his country's declaration of independence.
   Lozaraitis, who returned this week from a trip through both
Western and Eastern Europe, said support for Lihuanian independence
is far greater in the East.
   ``I have the impression that in Western Europe they were living
in a very calm, pacific period and they were getting rich _ and
that these upheavals in Eastern Europe are worrying them,'' he said.
   ``They think any change in Eastern Europe is frightfully
dangerous,'' he said. ``There are sympathetic attitudes, but great
caution.''
   He called on President Bush to indicate more clearly that he
supports Lithuanian independence and to grant formal diplomatic
recognition.
   He said he is ready to discuss Lithuania's fate directly with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze who is here to hold
talks with President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``If he wants to see me, I'm here and I will be very glad to
meet him,'' Lozaraitis said.
   ``I am today not so optimistic because I don't understand Mr.
Gorbachev,'' he said. ``I think he is acting like a man with the
mentality of the 19th century. You don't solve a problem with
troops and armored cars.''
   Lithuania is ready for a full discussion of all issues with
Moscow but will not renounce independence, Lozaraitis said.
   ``If we were to renounce independence it would be like saying,
`Shoot yourself; kill yourself; and then come to talk to us,''' he
said and added: ``We can't do that.''
   He said Moscow's call on Lithuania to follow the new Soviet law
of secession is ``a trap'' because of its requirements of a
two-thirds approval vote by Lithuanian voters and the Soviet
parliament followed by a five-year waiting period.
   ``They ask us, `why not wait?''' he said. ``We have waited for
years and years.''
   ``If independence were reverse, everything we did for the last
50 years has no significance,'' he said. ``We can't discuss this
fundamental and essential question.''
   But he made clear Lithuania is willing to slow the process if
Moscow needs time for its own internal political reasons.
   ``If Moscow needs time let them sit down and tell us about it,''
he said.
   In the meantime, he said, the Lithuanian people will exercise
patience and restraint.
   ``We will wait, we will have very strong nerves, we will not do
anything violent, we will not be provoked,'' Lozaraitis said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Service board of governors
approved spending $379.3 million Tuesday on new letter sorting
machines.
   The board, meeting in Raleigh, N.C., voted to launch the program
that will lead to bar-coding of all mail by 1995.
   Bar codes are a series of thin lines, similar to those used in
supermarket pricing.
   The money approved Tuesday will cover purchase of 1,349
automatic bar-code reading machines which can sort mail carrying
the codes. It is the first of a three-phase program to make the
coding universal.
   Bar codes already are being used in sorting much business mail,
and the company sending the mail applies the codes in the lower
corner of the letter.
   The new machines will be able to read a code anywhere on the
face of the letter, an advantage which is expected to encourage
more businesses to use the codes.
   Individuals will not be expected to place barcodes on their
mail. However, by the mid-1990s the postal service will begin
placing the codes on letters that do not have them to allow the
material to be sorted by machine.

<HEAD>Jordan Defends Iraq's Stand on Chemical Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's declaration that it possesses
advanced chemical weapons is part of the legitimate right of
self-defense, King Hussein said Tuesday.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat also supported President Saddam Hussein
of Iraq, who said Monday that Iraq possessed deadly nerve gas
weapons and would use them to destroy half of Israel if the
Israelis attacked.
   Saddam said Iraq developed the weapons during its eight-year war
with Iran, in which a cease-fire was reached in August 1988, but
did not use them.
   ``It is Iraq's legitimate right to defend itself against any
assault aimed at its existance and its development,'' King Hussein
said in remarks distributed Tuesday by Petra, the official
Jordanian news agency.
   ``President Saddam Hussein did not direct any threats against
anybody, but he affirmed his capabilities to face any concealed
aggression,'' said the king, who supported Iraq in the war with
Iran.
   The Iraq News Agency quoted Arafat as saying in Tunis, where the
Palestine Liberation Organization has its headquarters: ``We say to
our brother Saddam, go ahead. God save you. We are all with you
until the Palestinian flag flutters above the liberated walls of
Jerusalem.''
   King Hussein and Saddam are said to be close and often exchange
private visits. With Egypt and North Yemen, they formed an economic
alliance in February 1989 called the Arab Cooperation Council.
   Jordanian television said foreign ministers of the council
nations would hold ``an emergency meeting in Amman Thursday to
discuss the British campaign against Iraq and other threats against
Arab nations.''
   In his remarks, the king criticized Israel for not signing the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty, unlike Iraq, ``which was keen to
join and endorse'' the agreement.
   Despite this, he said, criticism is directed at Iraq instead of
Israel, ``the only nuclear state in the Middle East ... which
simply means that there are planned hostile intentions behind this
campaign.''
   He said the campaign was a result of Iraq's ``victory in
defending its national soil and the Arab regimes.''
   Hussein's apparent reference was to British criticism of Iraq's
execution of Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian-born British journalist
convicted last month of spying for Britain and Israel.
   Britain also deported an Iraqi Airlines official accused of
involvement in an attempt to smuggle trigger devices to Iraq that
could be used in nuclear weapons. The alleged smuggling plot was
uncovered by a joint U.S.-British operation.
   Iraq denied it was developing the ability to make nuclear
weapons.

   The runoff campaign between two Democrats
vying for governor began with talk of a peace treaty. But that
didn't last long.
   Heading into the April 10 primary runoff, Treasurer Ann Richards
and Attorney General Jim Mattox have attacked each other on
personal finances and drug use, with only a gaffe by the Republican
candidate to remind them of their common foe.
   The two cannot even agree on when to disagree in a debate.
   ``If Ann Richards is not tough enough to stand up and debate Jim
Mattox and to answer the questions that are on the voters' minds,
how is she going to be tough enough to stand up to the problems
facing our state?'' demanded Mattox, who has accused Ms. Richards
of refusing to debate him to avoid questions about drugs.
   Ms. Richards said she isn't trying to duck anything except the
mud being thrown by Mattox.
   ``This campaign has taken on the predictable form that Jim
Mattox campaigns always take. Whatever trash he can throw to try to
detract from his poor performance, he will do that, and I expect it
to continue until election day,'' she said.
   The ugly tone followed a bruising primary in which Ms. Richards
narrowly edged Mattox, 39 percent to 37 percent.
   The primary dashed the comeback hopes of the third-place
finisher, former Gov. Mark White, who was so upset he called a news
conference today to bitterly denounce Ms. Richards. He said her
tactics ``would make Himmler blush,'' alluding to the Nazi leader
Heinrich Himmler.
   ``I will never endorse Ann Richards. I will never support Ann
Richards. And I will never vote for Ann Richards,'' White told a
Capitol news conference.
   He stopped short short of endorsing Mattox over Ms. Richards in
the Democratic runoff, but did say he would be voting in that race.
   Earlier, White met with GOP nominee Clayton Williams. He said
today his pledge not to vote for Ms. Richards would stand if she is
the nominee in the fall, but he declined to specify whether he
would vote for Williams or just sit the election out.
   Peace talks between the Mattox and Richards campaigns began
shortly after the March 13 vote and went well enough that Texas
Democratic Chairman Bob Slagle voiced optimism that the runoff
would be ``a positive campaign.''
   But their attacks have grown more bruising.
   Mattox has accused Ms. Richards of using illegal drugs 10 years
ago. He offered no evidence but said his opponent must address the
issue.
   ``She doesn't want to give a simple yes or no about cocaine,
about marijuana, about other hallucinogens. She must answer what
she used, how much, for how long and who supplied them,'' he said.
   The 56-year-old Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, passed a
drug test and challenged Mattox to do the same.
   She also asked Mattox to follow her example and disclose his
income tax returns. Ms. Richards said there are tough questions
that Mattox is ducking _ such as how he could borrow $1.4 million
on a $75,000 government salary.
   Neither of the survivors has developed a clear lead heading into
the runoff.
   Downplaying the campaign's tone, Democratic leaders say either
Ms. Richards or Mattox will make a better candidate than Williams,
who is trying to escape the fallout from a remark he made March 24
likening bad weather to rape.
   ``If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it,'' Williams said
during a cattle roundup.
   Although he apologized a day later, women's groups have
protested and Mattox and Richards sharply criticized the Republican.
   ``Clayton Williams' campfire gaffe is just the tip of the
iceberg, and after his so-called joke people are going to be
looking very closely at him,'' said Ed Martin, the state Democratic
party's executive director.
   It was one of the few things on which the two Democratic
gubernatorial hopefuls agreed.

   Israel is taking seriously Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's threat to use chemical weapons, with some
officials calling for a gas mask in every house.
   But the new Middle East tensions are not likely to produce any
immediate military conflict.
   One reason is that the signals coming from Israeli officials
indicate there will be no attempt at this point to launch a
pre-emptive strike like the June 1981 air raid on Iraq's Osirak
nuclear plant.
   ``I think the message here is: cool things down, don't get into
unnecessary escalation and a misreading of intentions,'' said Dore
Gold, a Middle East analyst at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center
for Strategic Studies.
   Officials in Jerusalem have issued statements stressing Israel
has ``no aggressive intentions'' and noting a pre-emptive strike
would not be risk-free as it was in 1981 because Iraq now has
missiles and warplanes that could reach Israel.
   Also, while there is concern about Iraq's nuclear program, it
does not seem to be on the verge of producing an atomic weapon as
Israel claimed in 1981.
   Jaffee Center expert Joe Alpher said Iraq's nuclear development
was five to 10 years away while Space Agency head Yuval Neeman
estimated that it was three to five years in the offing.
   Israel's reaction, for now, appeared confined to a strong
showing of its technological superiority _ the launch of the Ofek-2
satellite, which required a powerful missile and sophisticated
electronic capabilities.
   Analysts in Israel believe Iraq is also unlikely to initiate a
military action because it would invite massive Israeli retaliation.
   ``I don't think the Iraqi motivation for this verbal escalation
is a desire to fight with Israel at this point,'' said Alpher.
   ``It seems to us that the Iraqis are more concerned with the
internal situation in Iraq,'' he added, suggesting the sharpness of
Saddam's threat to ``eat half of Israel'' may have been an attempt
to divert attention from social unrest at home.
   Writing in the liberal Haaretz newspaper, military commentator
Zeev Shiff said Saddam's tough words may have been ill temper over
the arrest in Britain of his agents who were while trying to
smuggle electronic triggers that could be used for atomic weapons.
   Alpher said the Iraqi president's record was a reason for
concern, both because he has used chemical weapons in the past and
because he ignored the high costs in starting a war with Iran.
   ``Because he is unpredictable and has a record for taking on
more than he can chew, we have to be concerned and be prepared and
to take him seriously,'' said Alpher said.
   Gold said the Iraqi leader's remarks should shift the focus of
concern away from the Palestinian uprising to the overall
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``Saddam Hussein has thrust the larger Arab-Israeli conflict
back onto the world agenda after the intefadeh (Palestinian
uprising) seemed to put it into eclipse,'' he said.
   ``It will require reassessment by both the United States and
Israel of how to cope with the security challenge posed by Iraq,''
he added.
   Right-wing politicians like Foreign Minister Moshe Arens picked
up on the theme, saying the real obstacle to peace was Arab
radicalism and not Israeli settlement building in Jerusalem and the
West Bank.
   ``Where is the obstacle to peace in the Middle East?'' Arens
asked a mayors' conference. ``Is it in Jerusalem? ... Or is it in
Baghdad when Saddam Hussein says he has the chemical weaponry to
wipe half of Israel off the earth?''
   Although the threat of military conflict seemed distant, a
variety of officials stressed that Israel should step up its
preparedness.
   Michael Dekel, an aide to caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, urged the government to order the immediate disribution of
gas masks to every home.
   For the past two years, Israel has been holding drills to train
the 1.5 million school children about defense against chemical
weapon attack. It issued gas masks throughout two towns on an
experimental basis.
   The Israeli army has protective clothing for gas attacks, but
the current instructions for civilians are to remain indoors, seal
a room as much as possible and put on a gas mask.
   Even new Israeli telephone books give instructions on what to do
in case of a gas attack.
   Dekel said Iraq's threats meant the program should be speeded
up. ``We need to prepare the civilian population, not only with
practice, but with equipment in the case of surprise attack,'' he
said.

   Wisconsin voters went to the polls
Tuesday to decide whether to limit the governor's unusually strong
veto power and whether a state Supreme Court justice should be
replaced by a deaf challenger.
   In northern Wisconsin, state Rep. Jim Holperin faced Republican
Brian Sherren in a recall election stemming from a sometimes
violent dispute over Indians' rights to hunt, fish and cut timber
outside their reservations.
   On ballots elsewhere were a trash recycling proposal in Kansas
City, Mo., and a plan to increase St. Louis' hotel-motel tax by 3.5
percent to help fund a planned 70,000-seat, $250 million domed
stadium.
   In Bismarck, N.D., 18-year-old high school senior Lee Palmer was
among three candidates running for mayor.
   In Tulsa, Okla., 20 people sought nine city council seats and
two ran for mayor in a new strong mayor-council form of government.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
filed a lawsuit claiming the old commission form of government
denied blacks a voice in decision-making.
   Wisconsin's so-called ``Vanna White veto'' has allowed Gov.
Tommy G. Thompson to rewrite legislation by striking words and even
letters, punctuation and numerals.
   Foes of the veto power _ nicknamed for the letter-flipping
hostess of the television game show ``Wheel of Fortune'' _ said it
gives legislative power to the executive branch, violating the
constitutional separation of powers.
   A constitutional amendment on Tuesday's ballot would bar the
governor from using his veto to strike letters to change the
meaning of legislation. The governor could still strike words,
numerals or entire sentences.
   In Wisconsin's state Supreme Court race, state Appeals Judge
Richard Brown, who is deaf, challenged Justice Donald Steinmetz for
a 10-year term. Brown's deafness wasn't an issue, but the unusually
hotly contested campaign included sparring over abortion, court
workloads and campaign funding.
   In northern Wisconsin, state Rep. Jim Holperin faced Republican
Brian Sherren in a recall sparked by critics of Chippewa
spearfishing who said Holperin had lost touch with his constituents
over the issue that has caused five years of unrest _ Indian treaty
rights.

<TEXT>
   The first-term Republican governor defended his authority to
selectively eliminate letters and urged voters to retain it.
   The state constitution gives the governor the right to veto any
appropriation bill ``in part.''
   Thompson's most famous ``Vanna veto'' was when he reworked a
bill in 1988 that limited the time a juvenile could be held in
detention to 48 hours. The governor boosted the limit to 10 days by
crossing out ``48 hours'' and most of the bill's next four lines,
leaving intact only the word ``day'' and four other strategically
placed letters: ``t-e-n day-s.''
   The governor's record 290 partial vetoes in the 1987-89 state
budget _ many of which changed appropriations bills by striking
numbers and letters or merging words _ so angered Democrats that
they sued Thompson. In 1988, they lost in the state Supreme Court.
   Supreme Court challenger Brown, a district judge since 1978,
accused incumbent Steinmetz, 65, of backing out of a televised
debate because he didn't want to discuss abortion, the environment
and the Supreme Court workload.
   Steinmetz said the judicial code of ethics prevented him from
stating his personal position of issues, but he was endorsed by the
political action committee on Wisconsin Right to Life.
   The Wisconsin recall was rooted in a 1983 federal court ruling
that said Wisconsin's six Chippewa bands retained the right to
fish, hunt, cut timber and gather food on off-reservation public
lands under 19th-century treaties that ceded northern Wisconsin to
the U.S. government. The ruling is under appeal.
   Recall organizers, primarily Stop Treaty Abuse-Wisconsin, were
especially critical of Holperin's support last year for a 10-year,
multimillion-dollar payment to the Lac du Flambeau Chippewa in
return for the band limiting their exercise of treaty rights. The
tribe rejected the pact.
   On March 6, Holperin got 69 percent of the vote in winning a
Democratic recall primary. Afterward, Holperin's defeated opponent
said people were not as upset about treaty rights as he had thought.
   In North Dakota, Palmer entered the race at the urging of his
Bismarck High School journalism class because he was willing to run
for mayor and met the minimum age requirement.

   Reginald S. Alexander, a politician,
sports enthusiast and longtime member of the International Olympics
Committee, has died of an undisclosed illness, relatives said
Tuesday. He was 75.
   A family member said Alexander's will directed there be no
published obituary. She declined further comment.
   A Kenyan sports official, who asked not to be further
identified, said Alexander died Saturday in a Nairobi hospital,
where he had been hospitalized nearly a week.
   Alexander was born Nov. 14, 1914 in Nairobi, the capital of what
was then the British colony of Kenya. He served in the Royal Air
Force during World War II.
   Alexander entered local politics after returning to Naibori,
first in 1948 as a Nairobi city legislator and then as mayor of the
city in 1954. When Kenya gained independence from Britain in 1963,
Alexander served four years in Parliament.
   Alexander was best known for his enthusiasm for the development
of sports. Kenya is known worldwide for its athletes, especially
distance runners.
   Alexander was a founding member in 1954 of the Kenya Olympics
and Commonwealth Games Association and served as its chairman up to
1968. The organization later changed its name to the Kenya Olympics
Association.
   He led the East African nation's first Olympics team to
Melbourne, Australia, in 1956 and joined the IOC executive board in
1972. He was also a successful businessman in Kenya's tourism and
oil industries.
   Alexander's wife, Marie, died two years ago.

<TEXT>
   Two jurors deliberating Iran-Contra charges
against John Poindexter were contacted by the news media, the trial
judge disclosed today. He ordered the jury sequestered because of
the ``irresponsible behavior of the press.''
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene said the jurors hung up on the
reporters. They were ``alert and intelligent,'' he said.
   Greene ruled that the jurors, Leroy Witherspoon and William
Harris, would continue to participate in the deliberations, which
began Monday. Poindexter's lawyer, Richard Beckler, said he had no
objection.
   The judge said that ``some now might think this'' contact during
jury deliberations ``was an obstruction of justice. I will think
about that.''
   Witherspoon told a hearing today that Washington Post reporter
Nora Boustany telephoned him late Monday afternoon just as he
arrived home from jury deliberations. He said she wanted to know
when the jury would deliver a verdict. He hung up on her, but she
called back. He hung up again, he testified.
   Greene said he was told the reporter had just come to the United
States from Lebanon and didn't know the ``ground rules.''
   Greene called that ``a lame excuse.''
   ``I have no confidence that these rules will be obeyed,'' said
Greene. ``I understand the Post has many more reporters ready to
call the jurors,'' said the judge. ``None of us has any confidence
that these regulations will be observed.''
   ``I have decided to sequester the jury,'' Greene said. ``The
irresponsible behavior of the press leaves me no alternative.''
   Asked about Boustany's call to the juror, Bob Kaiser, the Post's
assistant managing editor for national news, said, ``She made a
mistake.''
   Kaiser said editors instructed Boustany to find out how to get
in touch with Witherspoon after the verdict was decided in the
trial.
   ``She did this by calling him up to ask him,'' said Kaiser.
   ``We immediately called Judge Green's chambers to tell them what
had happened and to apologize,'' Kaiser said.
   Kaiser said the second juror was not contacted by a Post
reporter.
   Harris said he hung up on a woman who called Monday night
identifying herself as a reporter. It was not immediately known
what news organization she represented.
   The judge's order means that jurors will be brought to the U.S.
courthouse each day by deputy U.S. marshals and will be housed at a
hotel by the government until they reach a verdict.
   Jurors deliberated for four hours Monday afternoon after
receiving final instructions about the law from Greene.
   Their first note to the judge requested more than 50 trial
exhibits admitted into evidence during the three-week trial, as
well as copies of the judge's instructions and the five-count
indictment against Poindexter.
   Poindexter, who was national security adviser to then-President
Reagan from late 1985 to November 1986, is accused of five counts
of conspiracy to obstruct Congress, making false statements to
lawmakers and obstructing congressional inquiries.
   The indictment charges that he lied to congressional committees
by denying in 1986 that White House aide Oliver L. North was
orchestrating private military aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels
at a time direct U.S. assistance was banned by Congress.
   After the U.S.-Iran arms-for-hostages deals were disclosed in
the fall of that year, Poindexter is accused of lying to Congress
by saying he was unaware of a 1985 shipment of Hawk anti-aircraft
missiles to Iran until two months after it occurred.
   Prosecutors contended that Poindexter lied about this shipment
to conceal the existence of a politically embarrassing document
signed by Reagan that described the arms deal as part of an effort
to free U.S. hostages believed to be held in Lebanon.
   The prosecution argued that Poindexter tore up the document
after lying to Congress to prevent its disclosure just eight days
after the president assured the American people he had not traded
arms for hostages.
   Beckler argued that Poindexter did everything he could to give
Congress the facts it sought, denying that his client ever broke
the law.

<HEAD>Estonia Supports Lithuania and Calls for End to Military Pressure</HEAD>

   Estonia declared support Tuesday for
the declaration of independence by its Baltic neighbor, Lithuania,
and appealed to Mikhail S. Gorbachev to end military and political
pressure against Lithuania.
   The Estonian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, also elected Edgar
Savisaar, the chairman of the Estonian People's Front, as premier.
That effectively put the Estonian government in the hands of the
grassroots political movement that has been pressing for
independence.
   Savisaar, 40, a former teacher and member of the Estonian
Planning Commission, received 54 votes, one more than he needed for
a majority in the 105-member assembly.
   Savisaar told deputies he would present a list of Cabinet
members next week and pledged cooperation with all ethnic groups.
   But sources said the new government is unlikely to include any
of the 27 legislators representing the non-Estonian population.
   Tensions between ethnic Estonians, who make up some 60 percent
of Estonia's 1.6 million people, and the other nationalities were
apparent in Tuesday's session.
   Delegations from the northeast city of Sillamae, a largely
Slavic area, said they would not accept a declaration by the
Supreme Soviet on Friday that Estonia is an occupied state. They
also called on Gorbachev to protect the rights of all Soviet
citizens.
   Estonia said it would seek to re-establish independence at the
end of a still-undefined transition period.
   Viktor Andreyev, deputy chairman of the Estonian Supreme Soviet,
said he would demand a referendum if Estonia pushes for
independence.
   Unlike Lithuania, the Estonians are treading a more careful line
on secession and have called on Moscow to start negotiations.
   But they gave their backing to Lithuania's March 11 declaration
of independence. They said the realization of independence was not
a domestic matter of the Soviet Union, ``but a matter of
international character.''
   The Estonian Supreme Soviet urged Gorbachev to support
negotiations ``on an equal footing'' between the Soviet Union and
the Lithuania.
   ``It is necessary to stop without delay the military pressure
from the Soviet side and political provocations, the purpose of
which ... is to perpetuate the occupation of the Lithuanian
republic,'' the declaration said.
   Moscow has set armored vehicles rumbling through the Lithuanian
capital, Vilnius, and has arrested a handful of the hundreds of
Lithuanian deserters who have left the Soviet military.
   The Estonian declaration, adopted 71-22, also offered Estonia's
cooperation with Lithuania but did not elaborate.
   On Monday, legislators decided not to participate in debate in
the national Supreme Soviet parliament in Moscow on legislation
concerning the status of Soviet republics and secession.
   ``That would amount to recognition of the illegal annexation of
the republic of Estonia,'' a Supreme Soviet statement said.
   Instead, the legislature decided to send two observers to the
talks.
   Tiit Made, an independent deputy and leading economic reformer,
said he did not believe Moscow would use force to stop the Baltic
drive for independence.
   ``What can they do to us? No, the tanks won't come,'' Made said.
``We have put the idea to Moscow and now we just have to wait long
enough for them to think it's their own.''
   The three Baltic republics, including Latvia, were independent
from the end of World War I until Josef Stalin annexed them in 1940.
   Savisaar ran unopposed, but other candidates would have been
nominated if he did not receive a majority vote. Savisaar replaces
Indrik Toome, elected head of the Supreme Soviet's foreign affairs
committee on Monday.

   The results of the latest poll are in on the
saga of the divorcing billionaire: thumbs up for Ivana Trump and a
mixed bag for Donald. The alleged other woman, Marla Maples, gets
massacred.
   Twelve percent of those questioned said they think very
favorably of The Donald, the nickname Mrs. Trump favors, and 30
percent said they regard Trump in a mostly favorable light. The
Gallup Organization conducted the poll of New York City residents
for New York Newsday.
   But 19 percent of the 1,010 respondents had very unfavorable
impressions of Trump, while 17 percent were mostly unfavorable,
Newsday reported Tuesday.
   Nineteen percent had no opinion. And, in an indication that a
self-promoter's work is never done, 3 percent said they'd never
heard of Trump, who has his name on apartment houses, casinos, an
airline and hotel.
   ``It seems to show his name is bigger than ever,'' a Trump
spokesman said.
   The jilted Mrs. Trump scored very favorable responses from 14
percent and mostly favorable from 34 percent. Twelve percent fell
into the ``mostly unfavorable'' category and 9 percent had very
unfavorable feelings. Four percent claimed never to have heard of
her. The rest had no opinion.
   Maples, alleged Trump mistress, apparently has no reason to
emerge from hiding. Her unfavorable rating was a combined 41
percent, versus 14 percent in the favorable category. Thirty-one
percent couldn't rate Maples, 14 percent never heard of her.
   Maples' agent, Chuck Jones, blamed press coverage. Ivana Trump
aides weren't talking.

   The judge who ordered Zsa Zsa Gabor
to work at a women's shelter as part of her sentence for hitting a
policeman wants a detailed accounting of her hours of community
service.
   ``Kindly send me copies of all records kept to document her
community service activities as to dates, times and activities
performed,'' Municipal Judge Charles Rubin wrote to the director of
the homeless shelter.
   In the letter released Monday, Rubin gave Vera Davis, executive
director of the Venice-area LIEU-CAP shelter until April 13 to
document Miss Gabor's work there.
   Ms. Davis filed a three-paragraph letter with the court Friday
stating Miss Gabor completed her 120 hours of community service but
provided no detail.
   Last month, the shelter director said Miss Gabor worked about 50
hours at the center but completed the rest of her sentence through
guest appearances and in planning a June 8 celebrity auction at her
Bel-Air home to benefit the shelter.
   Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox said substituting guest
appearances and the auction for hands-on shelter work was
unacceptable.
   Miss Gabor was convicted Sept. 29 for slapping Officer Paul
Kramer during a traffic stop. She also was convicted of driving
without a license and having an open container of alcohol in her
Rolls-Royce. She was sentenced to four days in jail, but that
portion of the sentence is being appealed.

   Figure skaters Katarina Witt and Brian
Boitano, rehearsing for their upcoming 34-city international tour,
say there's a special chemistry in their performance on ice.
   Boitano said they anticipate each other's movements and share
similar feelings about how the partner's role fits in with his or
her own.
   ``The way we conceive of each part is the same,'' Boitano said.
``So if I say, `I really feel like I'm doing this,'' she'll go, `I
feel the same way.' And when I look at her I can see that she feels
the same way.''
   ``In some ways, we are the same,'' Witt added. ``We always want

   Boitano, of the United States, and Witt, of East Germany, began

   Bill Cosby wears Ramon Ramos' jersey on
this week's episode of ``The Cosby Show'' as a tribute to the
Portland Trail Blazers basketball player who was critically injured
in a automobile accident.
   Cosby requested the jersey from the Trail Blazers' office and
wore it while Thursday's episode was being taped.
   Ramos' car hit an icy patch of road Dec. 16 and flipped several
times.
   The rookie forward, who starred at Seton Hall University in New
Jersey, suffered severe head injuries.
   ``He is still in a state between a coma and full
consciousness,'' said Chuck Williams, communications director for
Good Samaritan Hospital. ``We are seeing improvement from day to
day, but the progress is very slow. He's getting stronger, gaining
weight and is basically getting more healthy.''

   Harris County commissioners were considering a
resolution Tuesday to renumber Precinct 666 because some residents
are threatening to boycott elections if the number wasn't changed.
   Precinct 666 was established Jan. 1 with about 1,500 residents
who once lived in Precinct 470.
   Some suburban Deer Park residents view the number as symbolic of
the Antichrist referred to in the Bible.
   ``Deer Park is a fairly conservative, religious community, and
it's just a stigma they don't want,'' said Harvey Petree, a Deer
Park councilman who lives in the precinct.
   Petree said he has fielded a dozen or so complaints from
residents who have threatened to stop voting if the number is
retained.
   ``I don't believe it should be the intention of elected city and
county officials to discourage voting, and that's the effect it has
had,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Stealth Fighter-Bomber Cost $6.26 Billion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon on Tuesday partially lifted the
veil of secrecy surrounding the futuristic F-117A Stealth fighter
bomber in an attempt to boost confidence in the handling of
top-secret weapons programs.
   With the release of an 8{-minute videotape, a series of 10
photographs and two fact sheets, the Pentagon revealed it has spent
$6.26 billion to develop and build 59 of the dark, delta-winged
aircraft. That translates into a $106.2 million per-plane cost.
   Although the plane has been flying since 1981, the Pentagon
refused to even acknowledge it existed until November 1988.
   The fighter, which is about the size of the F-15 Eagle fighter
jet, was designed to penetrate any radar defense and bomb targets
before enemy forces can react.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams confirmed that three F-117As
have crashed over the years and that two pilots died. He declined
to say what caused the problems.
   But he hailed the F-117A program as a successful venture that
demonstrates the Pentagon can develop and build reliable, high-tech
aircraft in a classified environment.
   ``I think it's persuaded us that full-scale development program
can be used very successfully,'' he said. When asked if he meant
the secret funding programs known as the Pentagon's ``black
budget,'' Williams responded, ``Yes.''
   The release of the information comes amid weakening support in
Congress for the Air Force's B-2 Stealth bomber program, and as the
service is developing yet another super-secret aircraft, the
supersonic Advance Tactical Fighter.
   Many in Congress expressed ``sticker shock'' last year when the
B-2's long-classified figures revealed its $530 million per-plane
price tag, raising questions about the Pentagon's use of such
``black budget'' programs.
   Williams defended the Pentagon's success with the F-117A, amid
such controversies.
   The F-117A program ``tells us Stealth can be developed, can be
used on an operational aircraft, is a successful technology, that
it works,'' Williams said.
   While pointing out that the Stealth fighter has a tactical
mission and the B-2 Stealth bomber is used for longer-range, or
strategic, targets, Williams argued that the radar-evading Stealth
characteristics ``help to make us one of the most capable air
forces in the world.''
   The aircraft got its first combat mission in December. Two of
the aircraft bombed a field near a Panamanian Defense Forces
barracks to stun and confuse the Panamanians while U.S.
paratroopers landed nearby.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, derided the use of the plane as ``show biz'' by military
officers eager to show off their sophisticated weaponry.
   Lockheed Corp., won the contract to build 59 of the
single-pilot, two-engine jets in 1978 and the first planes were
delivered in 1982. The last two jets still under construction will
be delivered in the fall of 1990, an Air Force statement said.
   Although the Pentagon had touted its efforts to declassify much
of the information about the plane, Williams said he was unable to
disclose the jet's speed, exact range, weapons payload, or just how
much of the aircraft can be seen on radar.
   Nor would he say if the plane is capable of carrying nuclear
weapons.
   The spokesman did, however, describe the jet as being capable of
flying in the ``high subsonic range,'' or about 600 mph.
   He refused to say whether the jet could carry air-to-air
weaponry but did say it is carries ``the full range of tactical
fighter ordnance'' and is capable of ``defending itself.''
   The single-pilot, dual engine plane weighs 52,500 pounds. Its
wingspan is just a little over 43 feet. It is just over 65 feet
long, but only 12 feet, 5 inches high, the Pentagon said.
   The so-called ``stealth'' technology in popular understanding
refers to design and materials that reduce the ability of enemy
radar to detect the craft.
   This can be achieved by using designs that avoid the direct
impact of radar, and by using composite materials that can absorb
the radar's energy.
   The packet distributed to reporters included a series of
photographs of the plane, showing its angled exterior and slim
profile in flight and on the a desert runway.
   Because the aircraft are going to be used more openly, the Air
Force has proposed that the planes be moved from the Tonopah Test
Range to the Air Force base at Holloman, N.M., where its personnel
can live nearby and not be flown in by commuter aircraft, an Air
Force official said.

   Union members were offered company-paid trips
to Washington to oppose provisions of proposed clean air
legislation that were backed by the United Steelworkers, union
officials said Tuesday.
   About 150 workers, many from USX Corp. facilities, attended the
rally on the Capitol steps Tuesday as the Senate began moving
toward passage of the legislation.
   USX said it paid the expenses of its workers who attended.
   ``We look at this as sponsoring a rally for employees who have
expressed concern about this legislation and what it might mean for
them and their families,'' said company spokesman Ernie Glenn.
   The union leadership had tried to persuade members not to join
the rally.
   ``The steel companies are attempting to take advantage of our
basic steel local unions by planning an all-expenses, company-paid
rally in Washington,'' union president Lynn Williams said in a memo
to union directors across the country last week.
   ``It is not a rally which the United Steelworkers of America
supports. The steel companies are not themselves opposing the act,
but are using our members to front for them.''
   Charlie Grese, president of the local at the USX plant in
Clairton, Pa., said in a telephone interview that he changed his
mind about attending after speaking to Williams and other union
officials.
   ``There's no question we were about ready to come down,'' Grese
said. ``I told the company I would have to take this past the
international union and would not come down without authorization
from the international president.''
   Demonstrators at the rally opposed a portion of the legislation
requiring that people living near steel plant coke ovens not be
exposed to a cancer risk of more than 1-in-10,000 over 70 years.
   They expressed concern that such a guideline was unrealistic,
and could force the mandatory shutdown of dozens of coke ovens.
   Coke, which comes from coal, is a raw material of steel. Coke
ovens can emit benzene, a carcinogen.
   While the major steel companies oppose the bill, the union says
the measure provides enough time and leeway for steelmakers to
avoid hardships.
   Under the bill, steel companies that make extraordinary efforts
to control leakage from coke ovens would be given until 2020 before
non-complying ovens would be closed.

   Sen. Mark Hatfield, in an emotional plea for
increased money for Alzheimer's research, told Congress Tuesday how
the disease had affected his powerful father.
   Television actresses Angie Dickinson and Shelley Fabares also
testified about how Alzheimer's has hurt their families and urged
increased spending on research of the disease.
   The actresses were upstaged by the Oregon Republican, who drew
loud applause during a hearing before the House Select Committee on
Aging and the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
   The panels are considering legislation that would double and
eventually triple the $148 million a year the government now spends
on research into Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's is a mental
disorder which strikes older people. Medical science has found no
cure for it.
   ``He was a man of extraordinary strength. He was a blacksmith in
the days of the anvil, bellows and hammer,'' said Hatfield in
relating the story of his father who worked 40 years for the
Southern Pacific Railroad.
   He said his father remained active and jogged daily at the age
of 80.
   ``Then one day my mother got a telephone call from a woman who
said, `Your husband is here and he has lost his way back home.'
That was the first indication that something was awry,'' Hatfield
said.
   ``My father insisted on jogging every day and more frequently
than not, my mother would have to pick him up a block from our home
where he had lost his way,'' he said.
   Hatfield said he had a difficult time deciding whether to visit
his father while he spent the last four years of his life in a
health care facility.
   ``He did not know who I was. I tried to decide whether it was
worth it to see this powerful man reduced to almost nothing _ a
vegetable _ or whether I would feel better if I would just go on
home.
   ``Out of a sense of duty and love, I always stopped to see him.
So you could say I speak from experience about Alzheimer's,'' the
senator said.
   Hatfield said the state of Oregon is moving toward centralized
research and services for victims of Alzheimer's and their families.
   Last year 29,000 taxpayers used a check-off on their state
income tax form to donate $140,000 in tax refunds for Alzheimer's
programs, said Hatfield.
   Dickinson, an actress who starred in movies as well as the
long-running television series ``Police Woman,'' said Alzheimer's
should be treated like other diseases, with government programs and
insurance coverage.
   ``Alzheimer's disease has touched my life through my beautiful
sister Mary Lou Belmont. And, I have to tell you it has changed my
life forever,'' she said.
   ``Alzheimer's is more horrible and horrendous than most of us
can imagine. Its victims don't know where they are,'' she said.
   Dickinison said her sister has an early stage of Alzheimer's and
now has daily care but eventually will need round-the-clock care.
   Fabares, co-star of the television series ``Coach,'' said she
and her sister recently made the hardest decision they have ever
made by placing their mother in a nursing home.
   ``One of the worst memories is of my mother opening her mouth,
hitting her cheeks and pointing desperately at her tongue, then
breaking into tears. She could no longer speak. She knew in stages
what was happening to her, but she was trapped inside her own
body,'' Fabares said.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said a new study indicates the
disease affects 4 million Americans, double earlier estimates. He
said by the middle of the next century, 14 million Americans will
have the disease.
   ``With Alzheimer's disease costing society over $88 billion a
year, it is becoming the biggest of the `misery diseases' plaguing
and impoverishing older Americans and the families who care for
them,'' said Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., chairman of the
Committee on Aging.
   He said a federal commitment to fighting Alzheimer's is long
overdue.

   The rummage sale ad was attractive, especially if
you were looking for an armor-plated limousine or some high-tech
security equipment.
   But it was a joke, and somebody tried to play it on Mayor
Coleman Young.
   A classified ad in Sunday editions of The Detroit News and
Detroit Free Press and Monday's editions of the Free Press pitched
rare guns, gold coins, fully appointed limousines and a
state-of-the-art security system.
   About 25 garage-sale buffs showed up Sunday at the address
listed in the ad _ Manoogian Mansion, the mayor's residence, said
mayoral spokesman Bob Berg.
   The goods ``for sale'' were right out of the headlines following
revelations in January that the city spent about $164,000 to buy
armor-plate mayoral limos and Uzi machine guns for bodyguards.
   The coins apparently referred to reports last month that an
attorney for Young's private company sold South African Krugerrands
to an Oakland County coin dealer in 1988.
   Dave McDade, classified advertising manager for the Detroit
Newspaper Agency, said Monday the ad was scheduled to run again
Tuesday and had been pulled. It was purchased for $60 by a man who
did not identify himself, McDade said.
   Young wasn't impressed.
   ``They didn't play it on me,'' Young said, laughing. ``They
might have played it on whoever answered the door.''

   Marine Capt. Dianne Davis was surprised
when a colonel asked her if she wanted to spend the day playing
golf. She was even more surprised when she learned that President
Bush was going to be her partner.
   Col. Dennis Herbert interrupted Davis during a meeting Friday
and said he had to talk to her immediately.
   ``The colonel asked me if I had my golf clubs with me, and I
told him I did,'' she said. ``He said, `How would you like to play
golf with the president of the United States?'
   ``I know I turned ashen white. It was a question I couldn't even
conceive of being asked. When I was finally able to stammer, I
said, `Yes Sir!'
   Ms. Davis, who is stationed at the Quantico Marine Corps base,
met Bush, Herbert and the commandant of the Marine Corps at the
base golf course.
   ``The temperature was in the 40s, it was gloomy and cloudy, not
one of your ideal golfing days, but I would have played in a
blizzard,'' Ms. Davis said.
   She said she shot a 92, and ``the president's score was very
close. I don't think it is my place to say what it was. The other
foursome beat ours by one point.''
   After the game, Bush signed the score card, ``Certified to be
almost true. Thanks for the lesson, George Bush.''

   The Soviet government Tuesday turned up
the pressure on independence-minded Lithuania by restricting
traffic at the republic's border with Poland.
   The Polish Foreign Ministry, which announced the action, said it
was surprised by the Soviet action. The Polish Embassy in Moscow
was told to seek an urgent explanation from the Soviets.
   ``The Polish Foreign Ministry reminds that free border traffic
is regulated by international conventions, which should be
respected,'' it said in a brief statement. ``Poland is ready for
talks on this issue.''
   Poland is the only country bordering Lithuania. The Baltic forms
a section of the republic's western border.
   Soviet officials informed their Polish counterparts that the
crossing was ``temporarily'' closed Tuesday morning, the Polish
news agency PAP said. It did not say how long it would remain
closed.
   The agency said Soviets and Poles could continue crossing the
border to return home.
   The border crossing, in the extreme northeast corner of Poland
between the Polish town of Ogrodniki and the Lithuanian town of
Lazdijai, can only be used by Poles and Soviet citizens.
   Poles, sharing centuries of common history with Lithuania, have
rejoiced in the republic's drive to join Poland in shaking off the
Soviet yoke imposed after World War II.
   After the March 11 independence declaration by Lithuania, Polish
officials offered vigorous support for the republic's right to
self-determination.
   But the non-communist Polish government did not actually
recognize the Lithuanian government, a move that could endanger
relations with the Soviets.
   Lithuania was the subject of lengthy debate Monday in the
Solidarity-led Cabinet. Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski
reported no change in the Polish position that the ``requirements
to recognize the Vilnius government have not yet been met and we
recognize the Lithuanian right to statehood.''
   The Polish reaction has been complicated by the anxiety that
surging Lithuanian nationalism has caused among the 260,000 ethnic
Poles in Lithuania's population of 3.8 million.
   Poland and Lithuania were linked from 1386, when a Lithuanian
ruler married a Polish princess, until 1795, when the commonwealth
was broken by Russia.
   After World War I, the newly independent states of Poland and
Lithuania argued over Vilnius, where the population was largely
Polish and Jewish. Poland finally seized Vilnius and held it until
World War II.
   When Lithuania and Poland fell under Soviet domination, the
Polish border was moved west and the Polish population largely
uprooted. Vilnius is now the capital of Lithuania.
   Polish border officials had reported reduced traffic at the
crossing recently. On Sunday, 4,039 people and 810 vehicles used
the crossing, PAP said.
   The agency also said despite the closing, workers with valid
Soviet visas would still be permitted across the border for their
jobs.
   It said cargo transportation and train travel were continuing
but that bus routes had been halted.

   Imelda Marcos' attorney contended Tuesday that
George Bush urged her husband to invest in U.S. real estate and
that the CIA ``was aware of every transaction'' for which she is on
trial on racketeering charges.
   In opening arguments, defense attorney Gerald Spence also said
he plans to call Bush as a witness.
   The lawyer said that Bush, then the vice president, was
concerned about the Marcoses negotiating an oil deal with Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi and suggested to Marcos during a 1981
meeting in Manila, ``Why don't you invest in American properties?''
   The Marcoses, ``who saw themselves as children of America,''
took the advice, Spence said. ``They abandoned any further attempt
to invest in Libya and began to put their money into New York real
estate.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Steve Hart had no immediate
comment on the attorney's statements.
   Earlier Tuesday, a prosecutor portrayed Mrs. Marcos as an
uncontrolled spender who treated the Philippine National Bank as
her ``personal piggy bank.''
   The former Philippines first lady and her late husband,
Ferdinand, were named in the 1988 indictment that charged them with
stealing millions of dollars from their homeland's treasury to buy
Manhattan real estate, jewelry and art. Marcos died in exile in
Hawaii last September.
   On trial with Mrs. Marcos is Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi.
   Spence said Marcos was warned by the CIA that he might not have
enough money to marshal a force to recapture the Philippines if it
was taken over by the Communist insurgency.
   Without going into specifics, Spence claimed that the CIA was
worried that the Philippines would fall to the Communists as Cuba
had been taken over by Fidel Castro.
   ``The evidence in this case is that the CIA was aware of every
transaction that took place in this case,'' Spence said without
giving details.
   Prosecutors objected repeatedly as Spence gave a rambling
discourse of Philippine history. U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan
sharply rebuked the defense attorney several times.
   At one point, Keenan told Spence: ``We're not going to go back
to Philippine election campaigns. We're going to try the case
before this court.''
   Mrs. Marcos broke into tears as Spence told the jury that she
was a devoted wife committed to defending the honor of her late
husband.
   ``This is a woman who lived with her beloved husband for 35
years. She was with him in sickness and in health and when he took
his last breath,'' Spence said. ``It is her position: `I am going
to defend my husband.'''
   Although Spence said he was not going to use an innocent-spouse
defense, he claimed Mrs. Marcos, 60, did not understand the
``intricacies of finance.''
   ``She would say over and over again, `Ferdinand, what is
happening here? What are you doing in this situation?''' he said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Livingston, however, told the
jurors that the Marcoses were ``partners in crime'' who had
exported ``fraud on a colossal scale'' to the United States.
   Livingston said the couple ``grabbed from a dollar-poor country
to satisfy Imelda Marcos' voracious appetite for real estate,
jewelry and art.''
   The prosecutor repeatedly referred to Mrs. Marcos'
``multimillion-dollar purchases,'' implying greed was the
motivation for the alleged fraud.
   She said Mrs. Marcos treated the New York branch of the
Philippine National Bank as her ``own personal piggy bank. Every
time she descended on New York ... she cracked it open, (taking)
bundles and bundles of cash.''
   Livingston said the Marcoses, who earned modest salaries,
amassed great wealth in their homeland through kickbacks, bribes
and outright theft from the Philippine treasury.
   The money, more than $160 million, was then placed in secret
bank accounts around the world before being transferred to shell
corporations that acted as owners for four Manhattan buildings, the
prosecutor charged.
   ``They were not small apartment buildings,'' she said. ``They
were three huge skyscrapers and a large shopping center. One
building was a gold encrusted skyscraper on Fifth Avenue.''
   Livingston said the Marcoses also defrauded banking institutions
of $165 million to finance the upkeep of the properties.
   The prosecutor said the ``gigantic web of fraud'' was held
together by secrecy and accomplices who acted as fronts for the
Marcoses.
   Spence countered that argument by saying most people keep their
business dealings private. ``If everyone concerned with keeping
their investments private were prosecuted, this courthouse would be
pretty busy,'' he said.
   Livingston said Khashoggi entered the conspiracy after Marcos
was ousted from power in 1986 and the new Philippines government
sued to recover the Manhattan real estate.
   She said Khashoggi helped the Marcoses bypass a court order that
forbade any transfer of their holdings by creating false documents
to make it appear he owned the four buildings and part of an art
collection that was purchased with stolen funds.
   If convicted of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail
fraud and obstruction of justice, Mrs. Marcos would face up to 50
years in prison and a $1 million fine. Prosecutors also are seeking
forfeiture of the alleged illegal proceeds.
   Khashoggi, once described as the world's richest man, is being
tried for mail fraud and obstruction of justice and would face up
to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine if convicted.
   The trial is expected to last three to four months.

   Northern areas of the Great Plains still
suffer from lack of moisture for crops and pastures, but farther
south the story was too much rain, the government's Joint
Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday.
   ``Rain improved winter wheat condition in portions of the
central Great Plains'' during the week of March 26-April 1, the
facility reported. ``Crop condition was mostly good in Colorado and
Kansas. Nebraska's winter wheat was fair to good.''
   In the southern plains, too much moisture caused some yellowing
of the wheat crop and hampered fertilizer application. The crop
condition was said to be good to fair in Oklahoma and Missouri.
Rain improved winter wheat in northern Texas but excess moisture
was a problem in some areas.
   ``Winter wheat was mostly good in the Corn Belt and good to fair
in the Southeast,'' the report said. ``Powdery mildew was a
continuing problem in Georgia.''
   In the West, lack of moisture put stress on winter wheat in the
Columbia Basin of Oregon, the report said. Washington's wheat was
in good-to-fair shape, although Russian wheat aphids were a problem
in the eastern part of the state.
   The facility is operated by the departments of Agriculture and
Commerce. Weekly reports cover crop conditions but do not include
production forecasts.

   Siamese twins born last month
connected at the chest and abdomen underwent separation surgery
Tuesday.
   Jakob and James Watkins went into the scheduled 10-hour
operation at All Children's Hospital shortly before 11 a.m. Doctors
scheduled a post-operation news conference for Wednesday to discuss
the results.
   The twins, born Feb. 28 to Raquel and Scott Watkins of St.
Petersburg, had already been diagnosed as good candidates for the
surgery because they have separate hearts, lungs and kidneys.
   Joined in an area from the breast bone to the navel, the twins
appear to share only a liver and parts of their intestinal tract.
   The twins' were listed in stable condition prior to surgery.
They spent their first two weeks of life in critical condition.
   Siamese twins appear about once every 100,000 births, with more
than 50 percent dying within the first 48 hours.

<HEAD>House Approves Expanding Registry Of Bone Marrow Donors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday voted to spend $6 million
this year to expand the national registry of bone marrow donors.
   The lives of many victims of leukemia, aplastic anemia and other
blood diseases can be saved with marrow transplants. But many have
died because a good match cannot be found in time.
   The House by voice vote approved an amendment offered by Rep.
Bill Young, R-Fla., to provide money to expand the National Marrow
Donor Program from its current registry of 90,000 donors to about
150,000.
   Part of the money would go toward expanding the Navy's
laboratories so volunteers throughout the military could be typed
and listed. About $4.5 million would be put toward registering
other people who would volunteer but can't afford the $75 cost of
the tests.
   Harry Glenn, Young's spokesman, said it was estimated the Navy
would add up to 4,000 people to the registry and the public effort
about 60,000.
   The eventual goal was a registry of 250,000 in the United States
and a system for tying in with overseas lists of donors, he said.
   The marrow amendment was added to the House version of the
fiscal 1990 supplemental appropriations bill.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Says Justice Unit Will Review Findings of Gray Leak
Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with congressional pressure, Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh said Tuesday he would ask the Justice
Department's internal disciplinary unit to review the results of an
FBI leak investigation.
   Thornburgh said the Office of Professional Responsiblity would
review the inconclusive results of an FBI probe of leaks about a
criminal investigation involving alleged financial irregularities
in the office of Rep. William Gray III, D-Pa.
   The leak to CBS News while Gray was running for House majority
whip last spring produced a storm of criticism from Democrats on
Capitol Hill who charged it was politically inspired.
   It forced the Justice Department to take the unusual step of
saying that Gray was not a target of the investigation and was
cooperating with the FBI.
   The extensive leak investigation ordered by Thornburgh failed to
identify the source with certainty.
   The attorney general's decision in December not to refer the
matter to the OPR for possible disciplinary action was criticized
by several lawmakers, including Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   At a hearing of the panel Tuesday, Thornburgh told Biden that he
would ask OPR to review the report produced by the FBI
investigation.
   ``I do not believe that the FBI's investigation provided any
basis for disciplinary action,'' Thornburgh told Biden.
``Notwithstanding this view ... I have asked the Office of
Professional Responsiblity to review the report and to provide me
with their advice.''
   ``At that point, I will then assess whether any disciplinary
action is warranted,'' the attorney general said.
   Biden made the request during a meeting with the attorney
general last week, according to comments by both the senator and
Thornburgh.
   Asked after the hearing why he had reversed his previous
positition, Thornburgh said: ``There was an apparent
misunderstanding of what my position was, so I thought I'd better
clear it up.''
   The department had stated previously that its regulations did
not provide for turning over the results of a criminal
investigation to OPR, which conducts internal probes of alleged
impropriety by Justice Department lawyers.
   OPR has the power to conduct grand jury investigations of its
own and to recommend that the attorney general take disciplinary
action against specific employees.
   In a March 7 letter to Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., chairman of
the House criminal justice subcommittee, the Justice Department
said that the applicable 1980 regulation ``does not contemplate the
referral of investigative findings in a mater appearing to involve
a violation of law from the Criminal Division to OPR.''
   ``The purpose for referring a report to OPR is obviously to
consider whether an individual whose misconduct was not serious
enough to constitute a violation of law, should nevertheless be
subject to some disciplinary sanction,'' said the letter by Bruce
C. Navarro, acting assistant attorney general in charge of the
Office Of Legislative Affairs.
   ``Consequently, no further disciplinary investigation could form
a basis upon which to consider disciplinary action,'' Navarro
wrote. ``Forwarding the report of the investigation to OPR would
thus not serve any purpose.''

<HEAD>More Child Labor Violations Uncovered by Sweep</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fines against fast-food restaurants and other
businesses are climbing toward the $3 million mark for thousands of
child labor law violations uncovered in a three-day federal sweep,
officials said Tuesday.
   One businessman called the effort by the Labor Department
``nitpicking'' and a ``crusade.'' But spokeswoman Johanna Schneider
said the department's ``responsibility is to enforce the letter of
the law.''
   She said companies had the right to appeal the fines if they
thought they were unfair.
   The number of violations grew from 7,000 to nearly 11,000 after
federal investigators gave the case files further review, officials
said. The total is about half the number for all of 1989.
   Civil fines on the businesses involved are expected to total
$2.9 million, up from the $1.8 million originally predicted
following the March 12-15 sweep, said William Brooks, an assistant
secretary of labor.
   Most of the violations involved teen-agers working more hours or
later hours during the school week than is allowed under federal
law.
   But there were also 1,450 youngsters age 14-17 who were
illegally employed in dangerous jobs, such as using power-driven
meat-slicing machinery, dough mixers and paper-balers, the
department said.
   An Arby's fast food restaurant in Santa Fe, N.M., was fined
$12,550 for various violations, including some for putting
youngsters to work in dangerous tasks. A similar fine was levied
against a Sizzler Steakhouse in Omaha, Neb., for the same type of
violations, officials said.
   Larry Pabian, who runs four Sizzler Steakhouses in Omaha and one
in Lincoln, said most of the violations came from a discrepancy
between Nebraska law and federal law on how late 15-year-olds can
work. He said the Nebraska law sets a 10 p.m. limit while federal
law is more restrictive.
   Pabian called the federal regulations regarding operating meat
slicers ``antiquated'' because the rules prohibit workers under 18
from operating the machines.
   ``Operating the machine _ that's a fine, and then wiping off the
machine _ that's another fine,'' he said.
   Reams food stores in Utah were fined about $20,000 for
violations involving about 80 youngsters. General manager Dick
Cheney noted that none of the violations involved hazardous jobs
and instead stemmed from letting youngsters work too long or from
employing children under 14.
   ``The violations were not flagrant at all. In most cases, they
involved kids working 10 minutes beyond their three hours,'' Cheney
said. ``We feel that we've obeyed the spirit of the law, and that
they're nitpicking. They're on some kind of crusade.''
   Cheney said one store was fined because parents let their 12-and
13-year-old children carry inventory sheets at once-a-year stock
counting events.
   The businesses identified Tuesday involved 170 cases that
investigators have completed; some of the biggest cases are still
open, the agency said.
   The stiffest fine so far _ $29,050 _ was against GFF Foods
grocery store in Moore, Okla., which was accused of
hazardous-occupation and record-keeping violations involving 47
youngsters. The store owner could not immediately be reached for
comment.
   Dozens of companies were listed from around the country,
including individual restaurants that are part of the following
fast-food chains: McDonald's, Taco Bell, Jack in the Box and Burger
King.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said the new findings reinforce
``our belief that the trend toward violations is growing.''
   Nearly half of the fast-food restaurants and other businesses
targeted in the sweep were found to be employing children
illegally, Brooks said. Of the 3,776 firms investigated, violations
were found at 1,750, he said.
   About 225 youngsters under 14 were found to be illegally
employed, Brooks said. Children under 14 are barred from most jobs,
with a few exceptions such as certain farm work and newspaper
routes.
   Federal law forbids 14-year-olds and 15-year-olds from working
more than three hours on a school day or 18 hours a week during the
school year. Eight hours are permitted on weekend days and 40-hour
weeks are permitted in summer and during vacations.
   When last month's sweep was announced, Labor Department
officials said 500 inspectors had visited businesses in all 50
states. Most of the violations were at service businesses, such as
restaurants, grocery stores, pizza and donut shops or dry cleaning
firms, the agency said.
   Last year, the Labor Department's wage and hour division, which
enforces child-labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act,
found 22,508 minors to be illegally employed, an all-time high.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's main political groups agreed
Tuesday to try to form the nation's first non-Communist government
before April 15 and resolve lingering differences over unification
with West Germany.
   The conservative Alliance for Germany, winner of the most
Parliament seats in the March 18 elections and closely allied with
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, met for formal talks with the
Social Democrats, who finished second.
   Party leaders said following the afternoon session they had
agreed on a framework for talks that they expected would result in
a governing coalition of this nation of 16 million residents by
Easter Sunday, April 15.
   They agreed too to form smaller groups to discuss the issues
that divide them, particularly the pace of reunification. The talks
are aimed at forging a ``grand coalition'' that includes both
conservatives and liberals.
   East Germany's disparate political factions had suddenly united
this week to demand that West Germany give 1-to-1 value to East
German marks when the nations reunify and the powerful deutsche
mark becomes the common currency.
   Unification talks with West Germany had been temporarily on hold
while the newly elected Parliament chose a leadership to replace
the caretaker Communist government. The caretaker government has
been running the country since the fall revolution toppled the
hard-line Communist regime of Erich Honecker.
   The talks also follow the resignation of the Social Democrats'
leader, Ibrahim Boehme, amid allegations he had links to the hated
Stasi secret police. The controversy surrounding Boehme had
hampered negotiations.
   Social Democratic officials met with Alliance for Germany
negotiators just hours after the Social Democrats announced they
were ready to begin formal talks. Officials from the tiny Free
Democratic Party also participated in the meeting.
   The Alliance for Germany is a three-party coalition that favors
quick reunification with West Germany. It received the most votes
in parliamentary elections March 18 but not enough to form a
majority in the 400-seat Parliament.
   A two-thirds majority is needed to make major decisions for
rapid unification.
   Rainer Eppelmann, leader of Democratic Awakening, one of the
parties in the Alliance for Germany, said he was hoping for a quick
agreement ``so people in East Germany know where they stand.''
   The Social Democrats and the alliance have already held
``exploratory talks'' about forming a government. But progress was
hindered by the Social Democrats' insistence that one of the three
parties within the alliance _ the ultra-conservative German Social
Union _ be excluded from any government.
   The Social Democrats have now dropped that demand, but they are
seeking to limit any Cabinet posts the German Social Union would
have in a government.
   The third party in the alliance is the Christian Demcratic Union.
   Meckel said a key reason for the Social Democrats' decision to
enter formal coalition talks is the dispute over introducing West
Germany's mark as East Germany's currency.
   West Germany's central bank has insisted most East German marks
be exchanged at a 2-to-1 ratio. That has angered many East Germans
who were expecting to benefit from a 1-to-1 exchange rate.
   Lothar de Maiziere, head of the Alliance for Germany, said
Monday he was disappointed with the West German proposal and made
clear he favors a 1-to-1 conversion rate.
   Meckel said de Maiziere's stand leads Social Democratic
officials to believe the two sides could be successful in coalition
negotiations.
   ``For the first time, I have seen that Mr. de Maiziere has
publicly said something which is seen differently in Bonn. We see
this as a sign of hope,'' Meckel said.
   The Social Democrats have previously complained that the
Alliance for Germany is letting the West German government call too
many of the shots in drafting plans for German unification.
   Nonetheless, negotiations between the two sides could be tricky
because the Social Democrats have opted for a slower pace to German
unity than the Alliance for Germany.

<HEAD>Unified Germany Must Stay In NATO, U.S. Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A united Germany must remain a full member of
NATO, an organization that will play a vital role in maintaining
stability in Europe, a State Department official said Wednesday.
   James F. Dobbins, deputy assistant secretary of state, told
senators NATO should not be abolished even though the military
threat has receded in Europe with the disintegration of the Warsaw
Pact.
   But NATO will continue to play an important role, he said.
   ``We need NATO now for the same reasons NATO was created,'' he
said at a meeting of the Helsinki Commission. ``NATO remains
necessary for European balance.''
   It is likely NATO will play more of a political than a military
role in the future, Dobbins said.
   ``Many of the positive changes we are seeing in Eastern Europe
are not yet anchored in law and practice,'' he said.
   ``European stability will continue to be best served by the
maintenance of a multinational defense structure, and by a Germany
soundly grounded in Western institutions _ in particular by its
full membership in NATO,'' he said.
   NATO, he said, will guard against instability and fragmentation
in the region, and give the Americans a place in Europe. ``Without
NATO, U.S. public and congressional support for this engagement
would be difficult to maintain.''
   Dobbins' comments came at a meeting of the Commission on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, known as the Helsinki
Commission.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., chairman of the congressional
CSCE group, said CSCE, a group of 35 nations, will play an
important role in the shape of the new Europe.

<HEAD>Third House Panel Approves Disabilities Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Public Works and Transportation
Committee voted 35-5 Tuesday to approve legislation to protect the
civil rights of millions of disabled Americans, including those
infected with the AIDS virus.
   The committee vote is the third out of four needed to bring the
Americans With Disabilities Act to the House floor. The Senate
passed the bill last September by a 76-8 vote.
   The House Judiciary Committee, the final committee, is expected
to take up the bill near the end of this month, and a vote by the
full House could occur in May.
   The bill protects disabled people from job discrimination. It
guarantees equal access to public and private transportation as
well as stores, restaurants, business and professional services.
   The hearing- and speech-impaired would be guaranteed access to
special telephone services.
   Backers say the law is carefully constructed to avoid undue
hardships on businesses. They say it provides lenient timetables
for implementation.
   Critics say the bill is too vague for the ordinary
businessperson to understand, leaving interpretation of the law up
to activists and judges. They also say the bill provides nothing to
offset the high cost to businesses.
   The two previous House committees _ Education and Labor, and
Energy and Commerce _ also passed the bill by similarly large
margins.
   Although the bill does protect people with the AIDS virus
against discrimination, it does not protect homosexuals and
bisexuals against discrimination. It protects former but not
current drug users.
   AIDS is known to be spread by certain homosexual contact,
contaminated hypodermic needles and transfusions of infected blood.
A woman who is infected during pregnancy passes the disease to her
infant.
   President Bush referred last week to the bill in a speech in
which he urged Congress to ``get on with the job of passing a law''
to protect people with the virus or with the disease.
   Bush did not mention, however, the conflict between the
administration and congressional supporters over an effort by the
Justice Department to change important language dealing with
employment provisions of the law.
   The administration wants to decouple the disabilities bill from
the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The reason is that civil rights
advocates have introduced an update of the Civil Rights Act that
would enable people who are intentionally discriminated against to
sue employers for damages. The administration opposes that change.
   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which is referred to in the
disabilities bill, currently limits relief to non-damage remedies
such as back pay and injunctive relief.

<HEAD>National Debt Hits More than $3 Trillion for First Time In History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The national debt on Monday totaled more than
$3 trillion for the first time in history, the Treasury Department
reported Tuesday.
   That's $3,000,000,000,000. Count them: a three and 12 zeroes.
   A person counting a $1,000 bill each second would take 133 years
just to reach $1 trillion.
   And when the national debt reached $3 trillion, it meant that it
would cost every man, woman and child $12,000 to pay it off.
   ``The debt subject to limit did go over $3 trillion on Monday,''
confirmed Peter Hollenbach, public affairs officer for Treasury's
Bureau of Public Debt.
   The actual level of public debt subject to statutory limit at
the end of the day Monday was $3.023 trillion. That's just $99.59
billion under the statutory limit of $3.123 trillion. The national
debt stood at $2.989 trillion last Friday.
   Hollenbach said that despite a growing number of income tax
receipts at this time of year, he expected the debt to continue to
grow as long as the budget is not balanced.
   Congress enacted the current debt limit last November.
   The debt reached $1 billion in 1916 during World War I, climbing
to $278 billion at the end of World War II.
   It reached its first trillion on Oct. 1, 1981, and rose to $2
trillion on April 3, 1986.
   The rapid growth in the debt stems from fact that the government
been running huge deficits for the past decade. The inability to
reduce the federal deficit was considered the major economic
failure of the Reagan administration.
   Democratic opponents often pointed to the fact that President
Reagan ran up more public debt in this eight years in office than
all of his predecessors put together.
   The federal deficit has continued to grow since then and totaled
$152.1 billion during the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30.
   By the end of February, the deficit had reached $97.52 billion,
just $2.48 billion less than the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction
target for the entire year. Interest on the deficit during February
totaled $17.32 billion and is expected to reach $254.85 billion for
the year.
   Analysts have said the target for fiscal 1990 has all but been
abaondoned, with some suggesting the actual imbalance for the year
will total $160 billion to $165 billion.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Madeleine Kunin on Tuesday opted out
of seeking a fourth two-year term, becoming the latest of the
Northeast's governors to back out of a troubled economic situation.
   ``It is time for me to move on to new challenges,'' said Kunin,
a Democrat.
   Her surprise announcement came two weeks after Connecticut Gov.
William O'Neill decided not to run again and a year after
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, Kunin's closest political
associate, opted against seeking re-election this November.
   Kunin, 56, elected in 1984 as Vermont's first female governor,
gave an upbeat review of her years in office.
   ``We have made history here in Vermont,'' she said. ``We have
shown that women are strong and capable leaders.''
   Kunin has built a national reputation as one of the most
outspoken governors for abortion rights and the environment.
   ``Never has Vermont stood so proudly, both at home and
throughout the nation, as a strong environmental state,'' she said.
   Her decision not to run gives instant front-runner status to her
predecessor, former Gov. Richard Snelling, a four-term Republican.
Snelling, who did not run in 1984, has said one reason he is
campaigning this time is deep concern about the state's budget woes.
   The three best-known Democrats considering running are Lt. Gov.
Howard Dean, former state Sen. Peter Welch and former U.S. Attorney
William Gray. The primary is Sept. 11.
   In Vermont, sagging state revenues have prompted sharp
reductions in this year's budget and a proposed 12 percent increase
in the personal income tax for the coming year.
   The state's situation is not unique. A surging economy in the
1980s yielded huge surpluses for the Northeast states and allowed
the governors many initiatives. But a sharp economic downturn
prompted cutbacks and tax increases and sagging popularity for
governors.
   In Connecticut, O'Neill, a Democrat, announced March 20 he would
not seek a third full term in office. He said his decision not to
run again came after an evaluation of the ``political realities of
the day.'' His popularity was at an all-time low after raising
taxes by nearly $1 billion in 1989.
   Dukakis, whose ``Massachusetts miracle'' was trumpeted in his
1988 presidential bid, announced more than a year ago he would not
seek re-election. The state now faces a deficit officially pegged
at $780 million.
   In New York, Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo is facing his third
straight year of deficit problems and is talking about more than $1
billion in higher taxes and sharp spending cuts to deal with the
latest budget crisis.
   The region's three Republican governors _ John McKernan of
Maine; Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Edward DiPrete of Rhode
Island _ all are seeking re-election, and all are handicapped by
hard financial times.
   Maine faces a $210 million shortfall through the end of this
budget cycle in 1991 and McKernan has gotten a strong challenge
from Democrat Joseph E. Brennan, his predecessor, who has made the
budget woes a chief issue.
   New Hampshire has a $160 million deficit, and the state's lack
of a general sales and income tax is bound to be a big issue in
this year's campaign. Gregg is against such a tax.
   Eric Davis, a political science professor a Middlebury College,
said the tough economic times have taken the fun out of being
governor in the Northeast.
   ``This is not a good time to be governor,'' he said. ``Almost
all the Northeastern governors are facing the same sorts of budget
problems.
   ``Madeleine Kunin has spent her whole career talking about what
government can do for the people. It didn't look like fun.''

<HEAD>Foley Says He Would Vote Against Flag-Protecting Constitutional
Amendment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said Tuesday
that if the Supreme Court throws out the federal law against flag
burning, he will vote against a constitutional amendment to protect
the flag.
   By tradition, the Speaker of the House rarely votes and Foley
has not done so since becoming speaker 10 months ago. But Foley
said he would come off the speaker's podium and vote ``no'' if the
House considered a constitutional amendment.
   Foley last year supported passage of the law against flag
burning. But he said amending the Constitution, and especially the
First Amendment definition of ``elemental freedoms of this
country,'' was not justified.
   The First Amendment ``is the most sacred part of the
constitutional document, and to amend it for these reasons would be
extraordinarily unwise,'' Foley said. ``I think the judgment of
history would be unkind on the Congress or the state legislatures
if that were to occur.''
   The Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments for May 14 on
whether it will uphold the judgment of two federal courts that the
flag burning statute passed by Congress last year is
unconstitutional.
   Foley has promised a House vote on a constitutional amendment
within 30 days if the court rules against the statute.

<HEAD>U.S. Urges End to Violence in Natal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government called Tuesday for an end
to violence in South Africa after a week of black factional
fighting in Natal province.
   ``We recognize that the situation in Natal is extremely
serious,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said when
asked about President F. W. de Klerk's increased use of security
forces to quell the violence.
   ``We understand that the decision taken by President de Klerk to
deploy additional security forces to areas of growing violence in
South Africa was taken to begin the process of restoring order,''
Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She said it was in the interests of all the people of South
Africa to support efforts for negotiations between the white-led
government and the black majority on the country's future.
   ``At a time when the climate for negotiations is otherwise
improving, it is encumbent upon all parties to exercise
restraint,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``We call for an end to violence
from all sources and the quickest possible end to the state of
emergency.''
   Soldiers and police in armored vehicles patrolled in Natal
province on Tuesday to head off clashes between Inkatha, headed by
Zulu homeland leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and supporters of the
African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Police said at least 55 people had been killed in the past week.
About 4,000 people have been killed in Natal since 1986.
   Ms. Tutwiler commended de Klerk for announcing Monday that the
South African government would propose legislation authoritizing
amnesty for politically motivated criminal acts.
   ``This is another positive move by President de Klerk towards
fostering a climate conducive to beginning the negotiating
process,'' Ms. Tutwiler said, noting that the ANC wanted such a law
to enable its members to return from exile.
   ``The bill, when it becomes law, apparently will allow the state
president to grant returning members of the opposition amnesty for
the full range of their anti-apartheid activities,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   She urged the ANC to reschedule a meeting for peace talks with
the government as soon as possible. Last week the organization
canceled a meeting that had been scheduled for April 11.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the U.S. government applauded ANC leader
Nelson Mandela's agreement to meet with de Klerk on Thursday to
seek ways to end the violence in Natal.

<HEAD>Senate Committee OKs Higher Mileage Requirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate panel, ignoring protests by
automakers, Tuesday approved a bill that would require a 40 percent
improvement in fuel efficiency by 2001.
   ``It's so potentially devastating to our industry and to
consumer choice, we're concerned that it exists,'' said General
Motors spokesman Bill Noack. ``It's an attempt to legislate the
family car out of existence.''
   Automakers contend the provisions of the bill would force them
to stop making all but the smallest vehicles.
   However, supporters of the bill sponsored by Sen. Richard Bryan,
D-Nev., say higher mileage standards are needed to force production
of more fuel-efficient cars and reduce U.S. dependency on foreign
oil.
   ``The auto industry is lining up a phalanx of lobbyists to
oppose it,'' Bryan said. ``They'll be trying to convince people it
would be a disaster. We're going to have a tough battle.''
   The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation
approved the bill 14-4, but it is not expected to reach the floor
until June.
   Under current law, new car fleets _ all models produced in a
year by one manufacturer _ are required to average 27.5 miles per
gallon. The Bryan bill would require manufacturers to improve their
average fuel economy by 20 percent beginning with the 1995 model
year and 40 percent by the 2001 model year.
   The typical new car fleet would average 34.4 mpg in 1995 and
40.2 mpg by 2001, although some would be higher and some lower
because the increase would be based on improving the mileage from a
makers' current level.
   Bryan said the bill would save 49.1 billion gallons of oil
between 1995 and 2001.
   ``We are now importing more oil from foreign sources than when
the Arab countries cut us off with their oil embargo in 1973,'' he
said.
   The bill also would save more than 483 million tons of carbon
dioxide, 20 pounds of which are emitted with each gallon of
gasoline a car burns, he said. Carbon dioxide is believed to be a
leading contributor to global warming.
   When mileage requirements originally were imposed in the
mid-1970s, automakers met them by reducing the average car's weight
by 1,000 pounds, said Tim McCarthy, a lobbyist for the Motor
Vehicle Manufacturers Association. The average weight now is 3,000
pounds.
   ``We can make cars right now that meet the Bryan standards,'' he
said. ``But to cut out another 1,000 (pounds) you're looking at the
Honda CRX, the Geo Metro. I don't see them satisfying all the needs
of the public, either families or business. The consumer will not
be happy.''

   Actress Liv Ullmann told a Senate subcommittee
Tuesday that every other movement of the second hand signals the

   ``Every day in our world, from neglect, from preventable
disease, from war, 40,000 children die,'' the film and stage star

family, drugs and alcoholism.
   Ullmann spoke as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations
Children's Fund, better known as UNICEF. The subcommittee was
receiving testimony on the effects of war on children.
   Ullmann included in that category ``the terrible wars on the
streets,'' which is how she described homelessness.

<TEXT>
   Oscar and Barbara teamed to lead ABC to first
place for the week in the Nielsen TV ratings, while Carol Burnett
returned triumphant to prime time on NBC, according to figures
released Tuesday.
   ``The 62nd Annual Academy Awards,'' a 3{-hour foot-dragger on
Monday night, was No. 1 in the ratings for the week ended April 1.
The follow-up ``Barbara Walters Special,'' featuring interviews
with Chevy Chase, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Warren Beatty, ranked
sixth.
   Season-ranked No. 1 NBC had occupied the top spot for 23 weeks.
Its last drop to No. 2 was during ABC's World Series coverage the
week of Oct. 9-15.
   ``The Academy Awards clearly lifted us up there,'' said ABC
spokesman Jim Brochu.
   For the week, ABC was first with an average rating of 14.8, NBC
was second with 13.3 and CBS was third with 11.7. Each rating point
represents 921,000 homes.
   ``Carol &amp; Co.'' a half-hour, comedy-variety show featuring Miss
Burnett and an ensemble company, was in ninth place for the week
after a Saturday night debut on NBC.
   Another well-turned debut was ``Bagdad Cafe,'' a series starring
Whoopi Goldberg and Jean Stapleton based on the movie about a
German tourist stranded at a remote desert diner.
   The half-hour show on Friday nights was ranked No. 18 for CBS.
   ``Equal Justice,'' ABC's Wednesday night case for an hourlong
lawyer drama, was tied for 44th place in its debut show. A two-hour
``Equal Justice'' movie on Tuesday night was tied for 37th place.
   The re-introduction of ``FM'' on NBC was in a three-way tie for
51st place.
   Here are the top 10 shows for the week: ``The 62nd Annual
Academy Awards,'' ABC; ``Cheers,'' NBC; ``America's Funniest Home
Videos,'' ABC; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC; ``The Golden Girls,'' NBC;
``The Barbara Walters Special,'' ABC; ``A Different World,'' NBC;
``Unsolved Mysteries,'' NBC; ``Carol &amp; Co.,'' NBC; and ``The Wonder
Years,'' ABC.
   With ``The Simpsons'' taking Sunday off at Fox Network, a
special showing of ``Roseanne'' on ABC after ``America's Funniest
Home Videos'' managed to hang on to some of the hit show's audience
for a 13th place rating.
   Fox aired a one-hour version of ``America's Most Wanted'' on
Sunday night. Without the Simpsons, the Bundys suffered. ``Married
... With Children'' was in a three-way tie for 39th place. Last
week ``Married'' was 13th.
   The highest-rated movie for the week was ``Down and Out in
Beverly Hills'' Sunday night on ABC, tied for 16th place. The top
special for the week after the Academy Awards and Barbara Walters
was ``The Magic of David Copperfield'' on CBS, ranked 21st for the
week.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was the first in average ratings
for the network news shows, but after seven weeks in third place,
the ``CBS Evening News'' edged into second place. It beat the ``NBC
Nightly News'' by one-tenth of a ratings point, averaging a 9.4
rating to NBC's 9.3.
   ABC's broadcast easily beat both programs with a 10.6 average.

   Republican Gov. Edward D. DiPrete is seeking his fourth two-year
term under the cloud of a $100 million revenue shortfall this year
and a budget next year that doesn't raise taxes but that cuts
numerous social programs favored by Democrats.
   The Democrat-controlled General Assembly has refused to enact
many of the budget-balancing measures DiPrete wants this year,
although it did agree reluctantly to raise auto and truck
registration fees. And the latest March revenue figures indicated
the sales, corporation and income taxes all were not increasing as
rapidly as needed to support even a pared-down budget.
   DiPrete's popularity in a recent Brown University poll dipped to
its lowest ever _ about 30 percent, compared with 43 percent in
July. DiPrete predicts his popularity will rebound with an economic
upturn this summer.

   The United States has decided not to rejoin
UNESCO because of a continuing dispute over its management and what
the Bush administration considers its political bias, U.S.
officials said Tuesday.
   The United States withdrew from the U.N. Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization in 1984, accusing the Paris-based agency
of politicization and anti-Western bias.
   ``The time is not right for the United States to reopen the
question of renewing its membership in UNESCO,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   The department will submit a full report to Congress on April 17
explaining its reasons, she said, declining to elaborate further
about the decision.
   After reviewing UNESCO's actions at its recent general
conference and analyzing the restructuring proposals raised there,
the United States concluded that ``very little has changed since
the United States withdrew at the end of 1984,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The United States and Britain, which also withdrew from UNESCO,
accounted for some 30 percent of the organization's budget. Britain
too reportedly has decided to stay out of UNESCO.
   There had been some speculation the United States would resume
its membership after UNESCO got a new director general, Federico
Mayor of Spain. Mayor visited Washington several months ago to
lobby for the United States' return, meeting with administration
officials and members of Congress.

<TEXT>
   President Bush planted a tree in an urban
park on Tuesday as a symbolic gesture for clean air and new life
and dedicated it to an 18-year-old Indiana youth dying from AIDS.
   ``Let this be Ryan's tree,'' Bush said as he planted an American
elm and paid tribute to Ryan White.
   White, who became a nationally known advocate for the rights of
children with the deadly virus to attend public schools, was near
death in the intensive care unit of an Indianapolis hospital.
   ``He's been fighting a courageous battle against a deadly
disease and also against ignorance and fear,'' Bush said.
   ``Ryan has helped us understand the truth about AIDS and he's
shown all of us the strength, the bravery, of the human heart.''
   The president, on a fund-raising swing through the Midwest for
Republican candidates, used the tree-planting ceremony to observe
the last-minute Senate passage of compromise clean-air legislation
that has the blessings of his administration.
   He called the expected Senate approval later Tuesday a
``historic vote'' that he said would ``affect generations to come
as we work to build a cleaner, safer America.''
   It would be the first major overhaul of the Clean Air Act in 13
years.
   Trees, also, ``can also help ensure clean air,'' Bush said as he
planted the tree in a downtown Indianapolis park in unseasonable
near-freezing weather.
   Bush, who has also planted trees in a half-dozen other U.S.
cities, has asked Congress for $175 million in fiscal 1991 to start
a national program to plant a billion trees a year.
   ``As we plant this beautiful American elm, this symbol of new
life, let it be Ryan's tree. God bless that young man. God bless
his family,'' Bush said.
   The president delivered a major policy speech on AIDS last
Thursday in which he called for legislation to ban discrimination
and protect the rights of victims.
   Because of the seriousness of Ryan's condition, White House
officials said Bush had abandoned plans to visit Riley Hosptial for
Children, where the sick youth's family and friends were keeping a
vigil.
   Later, at a fund-raising luncheon for Republican Sen. Dan Coats,
Bush said Senate passage of clean-air legislation would help begin
``to build a cleaner, safer America.''
   But he cautioned, ``It's going to take a lot of work to protect
this great planet without throwing hard-working Americans out of
work.''
   ``I reject the extremists in the environmental movement who
would burden our economy by mindless regulation,'' Bush said. ``And
I reject those in industry who do not recognize their obligation to
clean up the environment.''
   ``Common sense tells us to find a needed balance. We will find
that balance,'' he added.
   Coats was appointed to fill Dan Quayle's Senate seat and now is
running for the job in his own right.
   Bush, speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One en route from
Indianapolis to Detroit, sharply criticized Iraq President Saddam
Hussein's threat on Monday to destroy ``half of Israel'' with
chemical weapons if Israel attacked his country.
   ``This is no time to be escalating tensions in the Middle East.
I find these statements to be bad and I would strongly urge Iraq to
reject the use of chemical weapons,'' he said.
   On other topics, Bush:
   _Thanked the House leadership for moving toward a vote on his
$800 million aid request for Panama and Nicaragua and urged ``the
Senate to act immediately'' before they head home at the end of the
week on an Easter recess.
   To Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell's criticism that
Bush's foreign aid request was ``a jigsaw puzzle'' without an
over-all view, Bush said, ``There's no jigsaw puzzle when it comes
to what is best for democracy in Nicaragua and Panama. ... These
are laser-like urgent requests to help Nicaragua and Panama.''
   _Said he has not yet heard back from Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev to the message Bush sent last Thursday on Lithuania. But
Bush said his meeting Friday with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze ``will be the chance ... to see how that message went
down in Moscow.''
   _Reiterated that he hopes the situation in Lithuania will be
``handled in a cool fashion _ freedom, democracy and
self-determination all goes forward, but where it's handled in a
way (that) the result is peaceful and no use of force.''
   Bush said he was ``a little encouraged by some comments that I
read out of Lithuania yesterday. I just would encourage the Soviets
to remember the pledge to achieve a peaceful resolution to this
very difficult question.''

   In his final stop on his two-day trip, Bush told a GOP
fundraising dinner in Dearborn, Mich., a Detroit suburb, that he
was proud of the clean-air legislation headed for Senate approval.
   ``Some think we must choose between a sound ecology and a sound
economy. Republicans say: We need both. America can have clear air
and good jobs,'' Bush said in prepared remarks.
   And, commenting on the so-called ``peace dividend'' that will
come from reduced military spending because of decreased tensions
in Eastern Europe, Bush asserted: ``The greatest peace dividend is
peace itself.''

   Testing of the $1.5 billion Hubble
Space Telescope resumed Tuesday after NASA technicians switched
over to a backup power system to prevent another interruption from
a power outage.
   Space shuttle Discovery is scheduled for launch April 10
provided the tests are concluded by Thursday and there are no
further problems, said George Diller, a spokesman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``We're on thin ice, but it's do-able,'' Diller said.
   NASA must complete a 52-hour test of the telescope's scientific
instruments before the shuttle can be launched.
   ``We won't know the condition of the Hubble Space Telescope
until we get power to it. (But) we have no reason to suspect the
Hubble Space Telescope suffered any damage'' from Monday's power
outage, said Bill Taylor, the telescope's chief engineer at Kennedy
Space Center.
   ``The schedule still shows it can be met,'' Taylor said of next
week's scheduled launch.
   Technicians were in the middle of the telescope testing Monday
when a broken pipe sprayed water on electrical equipment, resulting
in the temporary power failure. The outage knocked out air
conditioning at the launch control center and elsewhere, forcing
the shutdown of heat-sensitive equipment, including computers used
in the test.
   A system that backs up power to computers in the launch control
center's four firing rooms was taken over by a newer system able to
withstand an outage. Testing of the telescope resumed shortly
afterward.
   The 25,000-pound, 43-foot-long telescope, the most expensive
unmanned spacecraft ever built, was never in any danger from the
cooling system breakdown, Diller said.
   Technicians began charging the telescope's batteries again
Monday night, a positive sign, Diller said.
   On Saturday, Discovery's launch date was moved up from April 12
to April 10 because technicians believed they needed little of the
contingency time built into the schedule. As of Tuesday, no
contingency time was left, Diller said.
   Discovery's five astronauts will deploy the Hubble on the second
day of the five-day mission. It will orbit 380 miles high for 15
years, free of atmospheric distortion.
   The telescope will be capable of detecting objects 50 times
fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best
ground-based observatory.
   Images radioed from the telescope will enable astronomers to
study stars and galaxies so distant that their light has been
traveling to Earth for 14 billion years.

   An 11-year-old boy whose adoptive parents
separated him from his brother and sent him to a shelter during the
Thanksgiving season wonders what he did wrong. But a judge
ultimately will decide why things when awry.
   ``There's going to be a lot of finger-pointing,'' said Bill
Pierce, president of the Washington, D.C.-based National Committee
for Adoption.
   Cook County Public Guardian Patrick Murphy last week filed a
lawsuit alleging the adoptive parents separated the two young
brothers they adopted in 1984, putting the older boy in an group
home and forbidding him from seeing his 8-year-old brother.
   The lawsuit filed in Circuit Court seeks visitation rights for
the boys and $50,000 in damages for the child the couple gave up.
The lawsuit refers to the child as Rick, not his real name, and
says the parents _ identified as Joseph and Pamela Doe _ gave him
back to the custody of the state because he hadn't ``bonded'' well
with them.
   A hearing will be held Wednesday in which Murphy will ask for a
ruling on the request for Rick to visit his brother, Murphy said.
   ``It's every little boy's nightmare,'' Murphy said after filing
the lawsuit. ``Rick's parents told him they were going to put him
into an orphange and they did it. It's like telling a kid you're
going to send the bogey man after him and then doing it.''
   ``Mom and dad were talking about something, and they said they
were going to put me up for adoption,'' the boy said in a tape
recording made available by Murphy. ``I thought they were kidding.
They weren't.''
   The parents put Rick in the group home on Nov. 20 and got
approval March 9 from Circuit Court Judge Walter Williams to
surrender their parental rights to Williams.
   The parents' attorney, Mary C. Martin, did not return a phone
call Tuesday. Williams declined to comment on the case.
   Ron Morman of the Springfield-based Child Care Association of
Illinois said the case is particularly troubling because of effects
of the parent's action could have on the child.
   ``We view it with a great deal of concern because the whole
point of adoption is to help the child find permanence ... to give
him some sense of belonging, some sense of family,'' Morman said.
   Murphy said Rick is now in a temporary foster home and blames
himself for his new circumstance.
   Officials at a number of adoption agencies noted that the boys
in this case were not infants, but were older children adopted
after their biological mother abandoned them. They said these
children come to adoptions with problems and it is important that
they are matched with parents capable of coping with their
particular needs.
   Murphy, whose job as public guardian is to act on behalf of
children such as Rick, calls the child a ``normal kid'' who has
never been in trouble with the law.
   Pierce said it ``would be like malpractice to place a child in
anything but'' that type of home that best fits the child's needs.
   But matching children to families is ``an imprecise art,'' he
said.
   Agencies under the gun to place children rather than leave them
in costly foster care arrangements may take risks and place a child
despite misgivings about the home, Pierce said, adding that they
also can make mistakes.
   A November report by the National Committee for Adoption said
U.S. court records showed that 104,088 American children and 10,019
foreign children were adopted in the country in 1986, the last year
such figures are available.
   A study done several years ago in five U.S. cities showed a 74
percent success rate _ meaning one in four adoptions were later
dissolved _ said Joyce Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Washington,
D.C.-based Child Welfare League of America.
   ``People bring children back,'' Johnson said. ``Children, for
whatever reason, come back into the system and it's always a
horror-type story when it happens.''

<HEAD>Navy Concludes Nuke Blast Simulator Won't Harm Gulf Coast
Environment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>

   The Navy wants to know whether ship
electronics can survive a nuclear explosion in space and has
decided a simulator test in the Gulf of Mexico would have no
significant impact on the environment.
   But the service said one of three alternative sites in the Gulf
has too much air and sea traffic to be appropriate for the tests of
the Electromagnetic Pulse Radiation Environment Simulator for Ships
(Empress II) program.
   In a draft environmental impact statement the Navy this week
said the two sites it deemed acceptable both are located southeast
of Mobile, Ala. The unacceptable site is located southwest of
Mobile about 40 nautical miles from the coast.
   Empress II is a barge-mounted pulser that can simulate the
electromagnetic field that would be generated on earth by a nuclear
blast in space. The system sends out an electromagnetic pulse (EMP)
that lasts just 10 billionths of a second, but measures 50,000
volts per meter at 100 meters from the barge in all directions.
   The Navy plans to fire the EMP at passing ships to test the
effectiveness of measures designed to protect electronics systems
from the EMP that would result from a nuclear explosion in space.
   Critics of the program contend that the EMP would endanger
marine and plant life in the Gulf, the Navy personnel aboard the
test ship, and the electronic systems of airplanes and ships that
might be in the area
   But in the draft study on the program the Navy concluded that no
such dangers exist.
   ``The collective potential environmental impact of the proposed
Empress II action is estimated to be minor,'' the Navy said.
``Within this minor category, the potential impact is greater on
the socioeconomic issues and less on both the natural resources and
the physical site itself.''
   Ships would be barred from passing within two nautical miles of
the simulator barge in any direction, and airplanes would be
excluded from a zone 6,000 feet above the two-nautical-mile
exclusion zone.
   Plans call for the final environmental impact statement to be
completed by June 15, clearing the way for a decision by the
secretary of the Navy on whether to permit the testing program to
begin in the Gulf next winter, said Capt. William Mahew, manger of
the EMpress II program. The tests would be conducted up to 10 hours
a day for no more than 60 days a year between November and April.

<HEAD>Tight Senate Vote Predicted On S&amp;L Regulator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters and opponents of President Bush's
choice as top savings and loan regulator said Tuesday the nominee's
admission of past drug use will play little role in the Senate
decision on his confirmation.
   Senate leaders are aiming for a Wednesday vote on the nomination
of T. Timothy Ryan Jr. to direct the Treasury Department's Office
of Thrift Supervision.
   In advance, most senators and industry lobbyists are predicting
he will be confirmed by a narrow margin. Two Democrats joined
Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee to endorse Ryan by an
11-10 vote on Friday. The administration, if it holds all
Republican senators, would need to attract only three more
Democrats for victory in the full Senate.
   Such an outcome would not necessarily upset Democrats, according
to Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent
Bankers Association of America.
   ``In terms of Democratic politics, you have someone in office
who you can point your finger to and say, `I told you so,''' he
said.
   Backers and detractors of the 44-year-old attorney say the
debate will focus on his professional qualifications and not on his
admission that he tried marijuana and cocaine in the early 1970s,
when he was in law school.
   ``Nobody who I talked to on our side ... thought it was of
significance,'' said Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, senior Republican on
the Senate Banking Committee.
   Both Democrats and Republicans discussed the nomination in
private luncheons Tuesday.
   In the Democratic caucus, according to a source who spoke on
condition of anonymity, ``There was a lot of loud talk (about
professional qualifications) but the expectation was he will get by
on a tight vote.''
   Republicans ``were all aware of the cocaine situation and there
wasn't anyone who spoke who didn't say, `Hey ... in the context you
look at it, we're not troubled by it,'' Garn said.
   ``I took it as something that should be looked at. I wanted to
see if it was a pattern of behavior that extended beyond his
college years. I did not find that,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   ``I made my judgment based on the lack of qualification,'' said
Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the banking panel.
He and other opponents of Ryan point to his lack of experience in
banking.
   Ryan served as the top attorney in the Labor Department early in
the Reagan administration and as a private lawyer has specialized
in pension and employee benefit law.
   ``I don't think any of you would pick this man to run your own
bank,'' Riegle told bankers attending a trade group meeting.
   Many savings and loan executives are leery of Ryan because at
his confirmation hearing he said he was unsure if the S&amp;L industry
should survive. However, S&amp;L trade groups say they've been staying
out of the battle, not wanting to campaign against the man likely
to be the industry's chief regulator.
   Lincoln Savings and Loan Association owner Charles H. Keating
Jr., at the center the nation's worst thrift failure and the
subject of a $1.1 billion fraud suit filed by regulators, wrote
letters to all senators opposing Ryan.
   ``I submit this is hardly the time to shrink from the challenge
of finding competent people to handle the important affairs of our
government. ... I fear for the future of the Republic,'' he said.
   Republicans are stressing Ryan's strength as a manager and his
role, while serving as Labor Department solicitor, in cleaning up
the Teamsters Union Central States Pension Fund.
   The administration circulated more than a dozen endorsements of
Ryan from prominent Republicans and Democrats. They included Frank
C. Carlucci, former secretary of Defense in the Reagan
Administration, and George D. Gould, former under secretary the
Treasury Department under Reagan.
   Among the Democrats were Hodding Carter III, assistant secretary
of state under Jimmy Carter, and W. Harrison Wellford, former
associate director of the Office of Management and Budget under
Carter.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady continued a telephone
campaign, urging senators to vote for Ryan, who spent the day
visiting senators' offices. He declined comment to reporters who
spotted him in the corridor of a Senate office building.

   A 20-year-old woman married to an
unemployed oil worker gave birth Tuesday to sextuplets, and the
hospital in this western city claimed they were the first ever in
South America.
   All six were reported in satisfactory condition, though doctors
placed them in intensive care because of their low birth weights.
The mother had been pregnant for only 29 weeks.
   ``The father was happy _ although somewhat disoriented _ when I
told him the good news and showed one of the babies,'' said Dr.
Jaime Leon.
   A doctor said there are already triplets on both sides of the
family. ``Both have contributed with their genes to this multiple
delivery,'' said Leon.
   In addition, the mother had been taking fertility drugs.
   At a press conference, hospital spokesmen said they are the
first sextuplets in South America. Dr. Henry Fuenmayor said there
have been 12 other recorded cases in the world.
   The children were born from 6:30 a.m. to 7:07 a.m. The heaviest
weighed 2.4 pounds and the lightest 1.8 pounds, the Paraiso Medical
Center announced. They were delivered by Caesarean section.
   ``The mother and the sextuplets _ two girls and four boys _ are
all in satisfactory condition, but at least 48 more hours are
needed for a firm prognosis on the offsprings,'' said Leon.
   It was the second delivery for Elaine Paz de Medina, the mother.
She is already the mother of a 3-year-old boy.
   Daniel Medina, the 29-year-old father, lost his job at a private
oil company late last year. He hopes to find work at one of the
state-owned oil companies in this oil-rich region.
   ``The couple has had a very positive reaction throughout all
these months,'' Leon told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview.
   Ms. Medina has been hospitalized since January, when doctors
realized the pregnancy was exceptional.
   Public and private companies in Maracaibo have organized a
foundation to help the sextuplets through their adult life.
   ``Had they been born after the 30th week, probably they would
have required less precautions,'' Leon said. ``But I think chances
are good for their survival.''
   According to the 1989 Guinness Book of World Records, the
highest number of babies reported at a single birth is 10. But it
said nine was the greatest number medically recorded.

<HEAD>More Victims of Mysterious Poisoning Hospitalized in Kosovo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 30 ethnic Albanian children in
Kosovo on Tuesday were hospitalized claiming symptoms of a
mysterious poisoning that last month threatened to trigger
intercommunal clashes in the troubled province.
   The state Tanjug news agency and sources said the children from
Podujevo, 18 miles north of the provincial capital of Pristina,
complained of lung and skin irritations and claimed they were
poisoned.
   Yugoslav authorities and some Western doctors had turned up no
evidence of an alleged epidemic that hospitalized about 2,990
teen-agers _ most of them ethnic Albanians _ with the same symptoms
last month in Kosovo. Some doctors suggested a feeling of
insecurity and public hysteria may have played a part.
   Ethnic Albanians, who represent 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, claimed minority Serbs were poisoning them with a
mysterious gas.
   Serbs said ethnic Albanians stage-managed the poisoning to drive
them from Kosovo by igniting major ethnic clashes.
   At least 60 ethnic Albanians have died in clashes with security
forces in the past 12 months in Kosovo after Serbia, the largest
Yugoslav republic, changed its constitution to assume near-total
control over its province.
   Kosovo had enjoyed wide autonomy.
   Claiming Kosovo officials failed to protect Serbs from
harassment by ethnic Albanians, Serbian authorities purged
Albanians from leading police and government functions there.
   The Borba daily said Tuesday that Kosovo's Premier Jusuf
Zejnulahu and Police Chief Jusuf Karakushi announced their
resignations.

   The state Legislature passed a largely
symbolic measure Tuesday aimed at ensuring women will be able to
continue getting legal abortions until the fetus is able to live
outside the womb.
   Gov. Judd Gregg said he would veto the bill.
   After a brief debate, the House voted 200-135 for the bill,
passed by the House earlier and amended by the Senate. The margin
was shy of the two-thirds that would be needed to override Gregg's
promised veto. The key vote in the Senate last week, 14-10, also
was short of a two-thirds margin.
   The bill may not reach Gregg until next week, but he repeated
Tuesday that he'll veto it.
   Under the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision,
abortion is legal and widely available in New Hampshire despite
three 19th-century anti-abortion statutes that have not been
enforced.
   The National Abortion Rights Action League considers the bill
pro-choice advocates' best chance for abortion rights legislation
in the country this year.
   But Peg Dobbie, the group's New Hampshire spokeswoman, said it
would be a ``long shot'' for the Legislature to override a veto.
Though not giving up hope, she said pro-choice advocates are now
focusing on the November election.
   ``We plan to go out and elect more pro-choice legislators so we
can be veto-proof,'' she said.
   The original House bill called for no restrictions on abortion
until the 25th week of pregnancy. The Senate changed that to allow
unrestricted abortion until the woman's doctor determined that the
fetus could live outside the womb on its own.
   Both versions would allow abortions after fetal viability to
protect the life or health of the mother or if the fetus has a
life-threatening physical or congenital abnormality.
   Gregg believes the bill would foster ``doctor-shopping'' because
doctors will differ on what constitutes viability, spokesman Brian
Grip said.
   Gregg reiterated his stand that abortion should be limited to
instances where the mother's life is in danger, there is a serious
problem with the fetus or the pregnancy stemmed from rape or incest.
   State Rep. Thomas Gage, head of the Judiciary Committee,
supported the amended bill, saying it set a ``medical standard in
place of a political one ... rather than a hard line drawn in
statute by black letter.''
   But state Rep. Shawn Jasper said the medical community disagrees
about when a fetus can survive outside a mother's womb and urged
defeat of the bill.
   Elsewhere Tuesday:
   _In the Nebraska Legislature, anti-abortion lawmakers succeeded
in keeping alive a proposal that would require a 24-hour waiting
period before a woman has an abortion. They moved it to the second
stage of floor consideration without allowing opportunity for
amendment.
   _A Louisiana state senator introduced an anti-abortion bill that
provides exceptions for saving the mother's life during birth, but
allows no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. ``Just as being
raped and becoming pregnant is a traumatic experience, so is
aborting a child,'' said state Sen. Mike Cross.
   _In Minnesota, a second Senate committee rejected a measure that
would prohibit most abortions in the state. The 1990 legislative
session tentatively is scheduled to adjourn next week.
   _Voters in Ann Arbor, Mich., declared their university town a
``zone of reproductive freedom.'' Voters also approved on Monday a
token $5 fine on abortion, should state or federal laws ever ban
the procedure.

   A study of more than 12,800 men at high risk for
heart disease found the death rate from heart attacks was 24
percent lower for those who received advice about nutrition or
other health matters.
   About half of the 12,860 men studied at 22 clinics nationwide
received the counseling several times a year. The others were
examined annually and only received additional treatment if needed.
   The advice included information about lower cholesterol levels,
counseling on quitting smoking and improved drug therapy to control
high blood pressure, researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   The study of men ages 35 to 57 began in 1973 and ended in 1982.
The results reported in JAMA stem from a follow-up review in
December 1985, after the treatment ended, said Marcus O. Kjelsberg,
a statistician at the University of Minnesota's School of Public
Health, where the data was analyzed.
   Initial examinations in 1982 showed no significant differences
between the two groups, which surprised researchers and prompted
the follow-up, Kjelsberg said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   But the follow-up found the death rate from coronary heart
disease after 1982 was 10.6 percent lower in men who had received
the treatment, and the overall death rates were 7.7 percent lower.
   The biggest difference was in the death rate from heart attacks,
which killed 106 of those in the special treatment group, 24
percent fewer than the 140 deaths noted in the other group.
   The ultimate results were not surprising, given the multitude of
data showing a link between diet, smoking and heart disease, said
Dr. Jeremiah Stamler, a cardiovascular epidemiologist at
Northwestern University and a principal investigator in the study.
   ``Everything I know about all of this leads me to the inference
that this should happen,'' Stamler said.
   Researchers expected to see the results earlier, at the end of
the study, but they failed to anticipate several factors that may
account for the delay, Stamler said.
   One reason may have been that all the volunteers for the study
were relatively healthy, despite facing a higher than normal risk
for heart disease because they smoked, had high blood pressure or
high cholesterol levels or a combination of the three, Stamler said.
   Another reason for the delayed results may have been a change in
drug treatment for high blood pressure that occurred toward the end
of the study. The later treatment was considered more effective,
Kjelsberg said.
   Researchers did not determine how many of the men who had
received special treatment continued to seek it after the study
ended, he said, but they asssumed that many stuck to their
healthier lifestyles.
   ``The bottom line in this report is an encouraging one for the
notion that intervention on these three risk factors does lead to a
lower risk of death from either all causes or from coronary heart
diseases,'' Kjelsberg said.
   The study was funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute in Bethesda, Md.

   A former SS captain accused of killing
thousands of people when he commanded Nazi labor camps is expected
to be extradited from Argentina next month to face trial, the
government said Tuesday.
   Argentine authorities approved the extradition last month of
Joseph Schwammberger, who has reportedly been in ill health since
his arrest outside the north-central city of Cordoba on Nov. 13,
1987. He had been living in Argentina for decades, most of the time
in La Plata, near Buenos Aires.
   ``Schwammberger's case proves that even after long years, no one
who has heaped guilt upon himself during the Nazi dictatorship is
safe from justice's grip _ no matter where they are hiding,'' said
Justice Minister Hans A. Engelhard.
   Schwammberger, 78, had been a fugitive since he disappeared from
a train in 1948 while being taken from Germany to American military
authorities in Austria for trial. He reportedly found a way to
Argentina, when it was encouraging immigration of Europeans, and
entered the country in about 1950.
   Prosecutors allege he was responsible for the deaths of up to
5,000 people, mostly Jews. Camp survivors who traveled to Buenos
Aires in 1988 from Miami, Chicago and Toronto testified to court
authorities that he shot to death starving prisoners or set dogs on
them.
   Schwammberger was finally tracked down with the help of famed
Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal.
   Wiesenthal learned in 1971 that Schwammberger was living in La
Plata, where he had worked in a factory for years. The Nazi hunter
informed Stuttgart prosecutors, who issued an arrest warrant, but
apparently little action was taken by Argentine authorities until
1987.
   Schwammberger's name was on a list of 10 most-wanted Nazi war
criminals published in 1987 by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
Angeles.
   The list appeared in Argentine newspapers, which led authorities
to Schwammberger, according to Wiesenthal.
   Schwammberger, apparently tipped off that police were on his
trail, fled to a German-Argentine community outside Cordoba, where
Argentine police later arrested him without incident.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Wiesenthal Center, said Tuesday
the extradition comes at a ``very opportune time'' because of the
imminent reunification of Germany.
   The trial will be an important educational event for East
Germans ``who have never been exposed to the truth about the `final
solution,''' he said.
   ``I would say this is going to be the last major Nazi war
criminal trial, certainly of that proportion, in West Germany,'' he
added.
   Engelhard said ``all arrangements have been made to pick up
Schwammberger in Argentina.'' He said two law officials and an
attorney will accompany Schwammberger on the trip to West Germany,
scheduled May 3.
   Schwammberger will be handed over to justice officials from West
Germany's Baden-Wuerrttemberg state, which has jurisdiction in the
case, Engelhard said.

<TEXT>
   From glitz to snappy, colorful silk outfits, Hong
Kong's first full-blown style show in Paris was an auspicious
moment for the Oriental city.
   ``Hong Kong has progressed beyond bargain-basement clothes,''
said Dame Lydia Dunn, president of the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council, before the show Monday evening in an ornate foyer of the
old Paris Opera.
   Hong Kong is shucking its image as a producer of low-cost,
low-quality clothes.
   ``We are also now exporting high-quality fashion to big
international stores like I. Magnin and Bloomingdale's in the U.S.,
Harrod's in England, Seibu in Japan and Hertie in West Germany,''
said Dame Dunn.
   ``And now, the Galeries Lafayette in France, a fabulous
showcase.''
   The show was part of a Hong Kong promotion at the Galeries
Lafayette department store to last through April 28. It was staged
against a backdrop of Hong Kong high-rise buildings and began with
a tableau of traditional Chinese silk robes.
   The 20 young designers represented in the show brought out
clothes ranging from sporty sun-gear in dressy, full shorts,
billowy shirts and culottes to pearl-and-sequin-embroidered split
sheaths.
   They would have done honor to Suzie Wong, the appealing post-war
bar girl featured in a film made from the book, ``The World of
Suzie Wong.''
   ``Fashion is our biggest export,'' said Dame Dunn, a
high-powered figure in Hong Kong, the British colony due to come
under mainland Chinese rule in 1997.
   Trained as a lawyer and now a director of several conglomerates,
including Swire Pacific Limited and Cathay Pacific Airways, she was
named O.B.E. (Order of the British Empire) in 1978, Commander of
the British Empire in 1983 and Dame of the British Empire in 1989.
   Dame Dunn is optimistic for Hong Kong's business future, in
spite of a drastic slump following the repression in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square last June 4.
   ``Commercially, we're coming back nicely, and the stock market
has reached its previous level,'' she said.
   In any case, Hong Kong is currently doing well in Paris.
   An early Galeries Lafayette preview of the exhibition last
Friday looked like a post-Christmas Macy's bargain-basement sale.
   Galeries guests were snapping up everything from cat-shaped
porcelain teapots to wicker baskets, rugs and satin evening bags,
priced very reasonably by Paris standards.
   ``Just say that our daily sales since the opening have picked up
about 10 percent over our usual turnover,'' said Jean-Michel
Girardin, Galeries Lafayette's director of sales promotions.
   The show is also attracting store clients to an art exhibition
of antique snuffboxes, porcelains, tapestries and paintings from
private collections.

   The theft of the jury's luggage delayed
the start of a trial Tuesday for an inmate charged with killing his
former wife while he was free on furlough.
   The judge said the jurors, who were being brought from another
county, would have their lost belongings replaced and would be
seated Wednesday.
   ``Come hell or high water, we'll get the jury to St. Joseph
County tonight,'' said Lake Superior Judge James E. Letsinger on
Tuesday.
   The defendant, Alan L. Matheney, 39, is charged with murder and
burglary in the March 1989 beating death of Lisa Marie Bianco. The
prosecution is seeking the death penalty.
   The 12 jurors and two alternates had been selected Monday in
Lake County and was being brought 60 miles east to hear the case in
St. Joseph County.
   The luggage was taken Monday evening from two vans parked at a
restaurant near Interstate 65, while the jurors were inside having
dinner, said Merrillville police Sgt. Dan Dallas.
   ``It must have been during the (NCAA championship) basketball
game, because no one was paying any attention,'' he said.
   As part of standard questioning of prospective jurors to uncover
potential bias against the prosecution or defense, the jurors had
been asked earlier Monday if they had ever been victims of crimes.
   Letsinger said the jurors would be quizzed again to ensure the
thefts would not affect their willingness to hear the case fairly.
The judge said he expects the jurors will say they have not been
affected.
   ``Can you think of anybody who hasn't been a victim of crime?''
he said. ``I didn't know that was possible. Every time a politician
takes money in this county, the people are victims. There's no such
thing as a person who's never been a victim.''
   Defense attorney Scott L. King did not ask for a mistrial, and
Letsinger said he did not anticipate a motion for a mistrial.
   Ms. Bianco was found beaten to death outside her Mishawaka home.
The slaying occurred several hours after Matheney was granted an
eight-hour furlough from a Pendleton prison where he was serving an
eight-year term for assaulting Ms. Bianco. Matheney surrendered to
police later that day.

<HEAD>Mladenov Elected President, June Vote Set, Communist Party Renamed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Tuesday adopted legislation
for free elections and unanimously voted Petar Mladenov, who
initiated democratic reforms in Bulgaria, to a newly created
presidency.
   The ruling Communists also renamed their disgraced party the
Bulgarian Socialist Party in an apparent effort to distance
themselves from their hard-line past and decades of unpopular rule
in Bulgaria.
   The legislation for multiparty elections scheduled this June
sets the terms for the first free balloting in Bulgaria since World
War II.
   The legislation was agreed to last week following three months
of tough talks between the Communists and the opposition, and was
ratified by Parliament along with constitutional amendments
abolishing all references to ``Communist'' and ``Socialist.''
   Both the Communists and the opposition agreed last Friday to
Mladenov's election to the new presidency.
   Mladenov had served as the Communist president of the State
Council that was formally dissolved Tuesday.
   As in neighboring Romania and other East European countries, the
State Council under the Communists acted effectively as the
legislature in between infrequent sessions of the countries'
rubber-stamp parliaments.
   Mladenov, 53, was elected to the new temporary presidency. He is
to be replaced after the newly elected parliament approves a new
constitution.
   Elections have been set for June 10, with runoffs scheduled for
June 17. In his acceptance address, Mladenov said guaranteeing
peaceful transition from totalitarianism to democracy ``is the most
important and the most complicated task at this stage,'' the state
BTA news agency reported.
   He said Bulgaria's first test of democracy would be the June
elections.
   ``People should be provided with conditions to have their fair
and open say, proceeding from their own aspirations and acting on
their own free will on the future they prefer for (Bulgaria),'' BTA
quoted Mladenov as saying.
   He also said implementation of a radical economic reform would
require ``tremendous efforts.''
   ``Years of complications, strain and difficulties lie ahead, but
there is no other way out. We should not delude ourselves with
false hopes of miracles,'' Mladenov was quoted as telling
Parliament in his speech.
   Mladenov is relatively popular, according to recent polls,
because he is considered responsible for ousting longtime hard-line
Communist leader Todor Zhivkov in a leadership reshuffle last
November when he became party leader. He relinquished that party
post in February.
   After taking over the party leadership, Mladenov elevated
reformists to top positions and began a dialogue with the
opposition toward the transition to democracy.
   The constitutional amendments that were adopted anchor political
pluralism in the constitution and describe Bulgaria as a
``democratic, parliamentary and law-abiding state,'' BTA reported.
   The constitution was also amended to declare any form of
censorship illegal.
   The party's name change was announced by Stefan Prodev, editor
of former Communist Party daily Rabotnichesko Delo, or Workers'
Affairs, which changed its name Monday to the Duma, or the Word.
   Former Communist Party leader Alexander Lilov, now a Socialist,
told a rally in downtown Sofia late Tuesday that the party was
``breaking with the mistakes, the abuses and the crimes of the
past.''
   ``We want radical reforms in everything, including the party,''
Lilov was reported to have said, adding, ``Certain right-wing
forces are trying to push the country toward a new
totalitarianism.'' He did not elaborate.
   Mladenov served as foreign minister from 1971 _ when he was 35 _
until last Nov. 10, when Zhivkov resigned after 34 years in power.
   Born into a peasant's family in 1936 in a village in
northwestern Bulgaria, Mladenov studied philosophy at Sofia
Univesity and was graduated from the prestigious Moscow State
Institute of International Relations in 1963. He joined the
Communist Party a year later.
   A regional party secretary of the Vidin county in northwestern
Bulgaria, he quickly made his way up through party ranks and became
a Central Committee member in 1971. He was appointed a full
Politburo member in 1977.

   Michigan's government went to the U.S.
Supreme Court in its fight for the right to set up roadblocks to
nab drunken drivers, but Michigan lawmakers are moving to ban the
checkpoints.
   The House Judiciary Committee, citing a violation of civil
liberties associated with randomly pulling over drivers to check
for illegal activity, voted 11-7 Tuesday to prohibit the sobriety
check lanes.
   Such a ban, if approved by the full House and the Senate, would
take effect even if the nation's high court rules that the
checkpoints are constitutional. The court heard oral arguments on
the case last month.
   The state is appealing a February 1989 Michigan Supreme Court
decision that let stand lower court rulings declaring the procedure
unconstitutional. At issue is whether the random stops violate the
Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and
seizures.
   Gov. James Blanchard had issued an executive order in 1986
directing the Department of State Police to use roadblocks to
combat drunken driving.
   Only one checkpoint was set up before a group of lawmakers won a
court order blocking the procedure.
   ``I believe that sobriety check lanes are an invasion of the
Constitution, an invasion of human and civil rights,'' said the
bill's sponsor, state Rep. Morris Hood. ``Today when we scan the
globe and see what's taking place in Eastern Europe, in Central
America and hopefully soon in South America, we see the cry for
freedom, the cry for democracy, the cry for civil rights.
   ``I don't think you give away your liberty and your freedom
under the guise that it may save some lives.''
   State Rep. William Van Regenmorter said the right not to be
harmed or killed by a drunken driver also ought to be considered.
He proposed an unsuccessful amendment which would have permitted
the roadblocks in predesignated high-risk areas during the night,
when most drunken driving incidents occur.
   If the Democrat-led House passes the bill it will face a tougher
hurdle in the Republican-led Senate.

   At least five shots struck a
Southeastern Trailways bus Tuesday as it traveled along a Greyhound
route. No injuries were reported, state police said.
   A bus on the same route was shot at Saturday and its driver
seriously wounded.
   There have been reports of sporadic violence and other shootings
since 6,300 Greyhound drivers went on strike March 2.
   The company blames the union and says there will be no contract
talks until a week goes by with no violence. The drivers union has
suggested the company's refusal to negotiate is partly to blame for
the violence.
   Kentucky State Police Trooper Eddie Lair said the shooting
occurred along Interstate 65 somewhere between Upton, LaRue County,
and Sonora, about 45 miles south of Louisville, as the bus headed
from Nashville, Tenn., to Louisville.
   Lair said all five shots hit the bus on the driver's side, but
none of them penetrated. Officials believe a .22-caliber rifle was
used.
   The driver, who was not identified, could not say from which
direction the shots were fired, Lair said. The driver and the lone
passenger were not injured.
   On Saturday, another Southeastern Trailways bus was shot at and
the bus driver was struck in the left arm, requiring six hours of
surgery. That bus had not yet entered Kentucky when it was attacked.

<TEXT>
   Maoist guerrillas are calling for a two-day
general strike in this capital to keep Peruvians from voting in
Sunday's general elections.
   Leaflets in the name of the Shining Path movement found Tuesday
in two Lima markets warned voters to boycott the polls. The rebels
called their strikes for Saturday and Sunday.
   The government has urged voters to ignore the strike calls. It
says it will guarantee the safety of voters. Voting is mandatory in
Peru.
   Shining Path rebels earlier had called strikes in two mountain
regions Saturday through Monday.
   A police spokesman said the leaflets found in the Lima markets
said ``No elections,'' and ``No more tricks. Arms will lead the
people to power. Down with the government of hunger.''
   The country is governed by the popularly elected center-left
Aprista Party.
   The rebels called for an ``armed strike,'' which carries the
threat to kill those who disregard it.
   The guerrillas have mounted a wave of attacks to sabotage the
campaign.
   Late Monday, suspected guerrillas shot and wounded a guard
outside the house of a minor presidential candidate, police said.
The candidate, Ezequiel Ataucusi, is leader of a small religious
sect.
   Peruvians go to the polls Sunday to elect a president, 60
senators and 180 members of congress. They will take office July 28.
   In the presidential race, novelist Mario Vargas Llosa holds a
wide lead in opinion polls. But most analysts predict he will fall
short of a majority, requiring a runoff.
   The Shining Path launched its armed insurgency against Peru's
elected governments in 1980. The government says more than 18,000
people have died in the violence.

   Die-hard mutineers held fast to a
large part of Strangeways Prison on Tuesday for the third day and
kept other inmates from surrendering, the government said. A
wounded prisoner died in a hospital.
   Thirteen guards were injured by flying bricks, poles and other
missiles in an operation Tuesday to regain control of sections of
the decaying Victorian structure, said Ivor Serle, chairman of the
local branch of the Prison Officers' Association. He said six were
hospitalized.
   Serle said about 20 ``hard core of the hard core'' prisoners
were stopping the other inmates from giving up.
   Prison negotiators suspended talks with the holdouts Tuesday
night but were ready to resume at any time, said Charles Keseru, a
spokesman for the Home Office, the Cabinet-level department with
responsibility for prisons.
   Keseru and Serle said Tuesday night that 31 prisoners
surrendered during the day.
   Serle said 68 convicts remained in the red-brick prison. Keseru
said fewer than 40 convicts were left defying prison authorities.
There was no explanation for the discrepancy.
   Authorities have said 37 inmates and 19 guards at the crowded
prison have been injured since rioting broke out at a chapel
service Sunday morning.
   Strangeways, built in 1868 to hold 970 men, had 1,648 prisoners
Sunday, ranging from dangerous convicts to men awaiting trial.
   Manchester-born Derek White, 46, who had been in a segregation
wing for his own protection awaiting trial on sex offenses, became
the first fatality.
   He died at North Manchester Hospital where he had been in
intensive care since Sunday, suffering from head wounds and chest
pains, the Home Office said.
   Serle said the guards regained control of one wing on Tuesday
and all the lower floors of the four other wings held by inmates.
``There were many broken bones, and one officer has a punctured
lung,'' he reported.
   Advancing guards carried only shields and truncheons, he added.
   ``That's all. This is England, not America,'' he snapped at an
American reporter.
   But the Home Office's Keseru said Tuesday night that prisoners
still controlled four of the nine wings at the prison and the
administrative area.
   Guards regained control of the other wings and the prison
kitchen on Monday.
   As darkness fell, about a dozen young prisoners remained on the
prison roof in the cold, shouting through a megaphone to friends
and family gathered behind a police barrier below.
   ``The jail's going up tonight, believe it!'' inmates shouted.
   People behind the barrier shouted out names of relatives.
   ``Come bleeding down!'' a woman yelled. ``Who's shouting?,''
asked a voice from the roof. ``His mother!'' responded the woman,
who refused to give her name. She wept.
   British newspapers have speculated that up to 30 people died in
the rioting.
   Serle said no bodies had been found inside the prison. He told
reporters his ``gut feeling'' was that some men had died, but ``I
hope to God I'm wrong.''
   The father of a youth who was in the same wing as sex offenders,
segregated because of his age but on a different landing, said on
BBC-TV news his son told him he witnessed six murders. The youth
was transferred to a jail in the south of England where the father
said he saw him on Tuesday.
   Shown in silhouette, the father, who refused to be identified,
relayed his son's account of kangaroo courts in which makeshift
ropes made from sheets were tied around prisoners' necks. They were
lined up against the railings on the jail landings.
   ``The charges were read out against them and they were pushed
over. My son said he couldn't see any way they could possibly have
lived,'' the father said.
   Prisoners opened negotiations Tuesday with warden Brendan
O'Friel and demanded a member of Parliament witness their
surrender. They wanted each inmate photographed, as a protection
against beatings by guards.
   At Long Lartin Prison, 100 miles south of Manchester, 33 inmates
who barricaded part of a building after an attempted breakout ended
their protest peacefully Tuesday morning, the Home Office said. No
injuries were reported.

   Five Midwestern senators introduced
legislation Tuesday to include in the 1990 farm bill that they said
would protect farmers against the rising costs of growing food.
   Meanwhile, a House Agriculture subcommittee approved a dairy
program for the farm bill that revamps price supports in order to
stop excessive production of butter fat.
   The Senate bill, dubbed the Farm Income and Flexibility Act,
will be the basis for the target price section of the massive
legislation Congress writes every five years to set agriculture
policy, said the group of Democratic senators.
   The legislation is necessary to preserve family farming, which
is the best protection against rising consumer food costs that the
government can devise, said the senators. The group includes Sens.
Robert Kerrey and James Exon, of Nebraska; Tom Daschle of South
Dakota, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Kent Conrad of North Dakota.
   Kerrey said the legislation would cost about $12 billion
annually. The Bush administration wants to lower the cost of target
prices and has recommended spending no more than about $10 billion
next year.
   Target prices are the amounts the government sets for wheat,
corn, cotton, soybeans and rice. If the market price does not reach
the amount, the government pays the farmer the difference.
   Under the House dairy program, the government would buy up to 7
billion pounds of milk products, at $10.60 per hundred pounds, if
they can't be sold on the open market. Farmers who produce more
than their share of the government's limit would get a lower amount.
   The Senate has not approved a dairy plan yet.
   Kerrey, who has led the battle against the administration's
target price proposals, said there are three basic reasons why
consumers should want the government involved in the farm business.
   _Government management of surpluses protects against unstable
weather conditions.
   _U.S. food prices are kept the lowest in the world by a strong
government program.
   _The subsidy is a bargain at less than the 1 percent of the
annual federal budget.
   People who live in urban areas have an interest in seeing the
family farm preserved as a guard against the higher food prices
likely if farms were consolidated, said an aide to Daschle.
   If agricultural production were in the hands of just a few
people, food prices would also be under their control, said Mark
Ulven.
   If farmers don't have the government's help in covering their
production costs, they might easily go out of business and sell
their farms to a corporation, he said.
   ``U.S. consumers today spend just 10.4 percent of their
disposable income on food, the lowest level in history and less
than consumers in any other country,'' said Kerrey.
   But the producer's share of each dollar spent on food has
dropped to an all-time low, he said.
   ``In 1988, according to USDA, farmers and ranchers received only
30 cents of each dollar spent on food consumed at home,'' Kerrey
said.
   Conrad said that once inflation was taken into account, net farm
income in the 1980s was the lowest it's been since 1910 when the
government started keeping records.
   ``We keep hearing from the administration that the farm crisis
is over and farm income is at record levels,'' said Conrad.
``That's just a bunch of Washington happy talk.''
   Provisions in the senators' bill include:
   _tying target prices to increased production costs.
   _raising loan rates (which help determine market prices) by more
than 20 percent next year, and setting a floor on the loan rate for
corn of $2.10 and for wheat of $2.75.
   _establishing a normal crop acreage base for each farm that is
the total of the farm's current crop-specific bases, plus the
average acreage planted to soybeans during the last five years.
   _raising income support levels on oilseeds, oats and barley to
levels comparable with wheat and corn.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved a resolution late Tuesday
calling on President Bush to accelerate efforts to win the release
of Americans held hostage in Lebanon.
   The resolution, approved on a voice vote without dissent, also
called on countries with ``direct or indirect influence'' over the
kidnappers, including Iran and Syria, to press for the hostages'
release.
   The non-binding measure was sent to the Senate.
   An earlier version of the resolution had called for Bush to
designate a special envoy to negotiate the release of hostages, but
that provision was opposed by the administration.
   The document approved Tuesday called instead for Bush to
accelerat efforts through increased State Department and other
diplomatic activities and by enlisting the United Nations and the
European Community to exercise their influence.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., a senior Foreign Affairs Committee
member, said the administration had no objection to the revised
language and that it was not intended to revise U.S. policy against
making concessions to terrorists.
   The measure's sponsor, Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., represents
the home district of hostage Terry Anderson, the Associated Press
Middle East bureau chief, who has been held for five years the
longest of eight American hostages.
   She said it was ``important that we go on record'' to say, ``We
won't forget. We want you back.''

   A man was convicted Tuesday of
second-degree murder in the slaying of a 13-year-old neighbor whose
beaten, sexually mutilated and strangled body was found stuffed
into a storage closet.
   The nine-week trial had pitted neighbor against neighbor and
included obscene outbursts from both sides.
   The jury found Robert Golub, 22, guilty in the 1989 beating and
strangulation of Kelly Ann Tinyes.
   Victoria Tinyes, the girl's mother, pounded the courtroom
railing and screamed after the verdict.
   Other Tinyes family members shouted obscenities at Golub, who
sat quietly at the defense table. ``Who's the animal here?''
screamed one man before court officers took him from the courtroom.
   The Golubs and the Tinyes family sat on opposite sides of the
court each day of the trial. About 25 court officers were in the
room for the verdict because the families had confronted each other
several times since Golub's arrest.
   ``I'm just sorry I didn't get my hands on him,'' said Miss
Tinyes' grandfather, Victor Giordonello, outside the courtroom.
   Golub's parents sat crying as their son was led away in
handcuffs. Both sets of parents left without speaking to reporters.
   Golub faces up to 25 years to life in prison when he is
sentenced June 1.
   Miss Tinyes' battered body was discovered March 4, 1989, in a
basement closet of the Golub home, which is on the same block as
the Tinyes home in Valley Stream, N.Y. She had disappeared a day
earlier.
   Prosecutors said Miss Tinyes was lured to her death by a
telephone call from the Golub household.
   The prosecution contended Robert Golub forced her into the
basement and killed her as she fought off a sexual attack.
   Her beaten, sexually mutilated, strangled body was found wrapped
in a sleeping bag and stuffed into a storage closet. Her clothing,
ripped from her body in the attack, was found in three nearby
attache cases.
   Golub, who did not testify, told police he spent the day
sleeping and reading muscle magazines in his upstairs bedroom.
   Defense attorney Salvatore Marinello said Golub was a scapegoat
for police desperate to make an arrest.

   Mexico lodged a formal protest with Panama on
Tuesday in the latest round of a bitter quarrel over which
government has the shakiest claim to legitimacy.
   Mexico's ``energetic'' protest followed an assertion by
President Guillermo Endara of Panama that Mexico's governing party
used electoral fraud to stay in power.
   He made the remark after Mexico and six other Latin American
nations said Panama should hold elections to ``legitimize'' his
government. He took power in December during the U.S. invasion that
ousted dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Foreign Minister Julio Linares of Panama said Mexico and the
other countries are picking on the wrong guy.
   ``Has any of these countries broken relations with the United
States? Has any of them retired its ambassador from the United
States?'' he said in an interview Tuesday with Notimex, the
official Mexican news agency.
   ``It's easier to condemn the victim because the United States is
a powerful country, a country with money, a strong country.''
   For 21 years, Panama's dictators had the blessings of ``all
Latin America and the United States, too,'' he was quoted as saying.
   He added, however, that Panama was not considering breaking off
relations with Mexico.
   Columnists and editorial writers in both capitals have joined
the fray, as have politicians.
   Mexico's official government newspaper, El Nacional, used the
words ``bluster,'' ``swagger'' and ``stupid'' Monday to describe
Endara.
   Newspapers in Panama, meanwhile, said Mexico's ``party
dictatorship'' had been a model for Panama's bygone military
regimes.
   ``What kind of explanation does Mexico want?'' Panama City
columnist Boris Barrios asked Tuesday. ``An explanation because
President Endara spoke a truth that bothers them?''
   But a lawmaker from Panama's opposition Revolutionary Democratic
Party suggested in Panama City that Endara spoke unwisely.
   ``The president's advisers are saying he shot off his mouth,''
said Gerardo Gonzalez.
   The Mexican Foreign Ministry refused to disclose the text of the
protest note but said it called on Panamanian authorities to
``guarantee the security'' of Mexican diplomats and anyone under
Mexico's diplomatic protection in Panama.
   The battle began after the Rio Group _ Mexico, Colombia,
Uruguay, Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil and Peru _ said Friday that
elections should be held in Panama.
   Mexico, Peru and Argentina have refused to send ambassadors to
Endara's government.
   The Rio Group's statement, issued in Mexico City, angered
Endara. His ticket easily won a May election in Panama, according
to election observers, but Noriega nullified the results.
   On Saturday, Endara issued a retort to the Rio group's
statement. He said his own government was ``legitimized by the
people at the polls on May 7.''
   ``We don't want the legitimization of the Mexican government ...
because it is a government that came to power through sheer
electoral fraud,'' he added.
   The Panamanian president touched a raw nerve in Mexico, where
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has been in power
for 61 years and has often been accused of cheating at the ballot
box.
   Unlike Panama under Noriega or Nicaragua under the Sandinistas,
Mexico has not permitted international observers to monitor its
elections. The outcome of the 1988 presidential race is still
clouded by accusations the PRI resorted to electoral fraud.
   The PRI on Monday acccused Endara of presiding over the
``persecution, torture, jailing and execution of thousands of
Panamanians,'' presumably during the invasion. There have been no
reports of torture or execution.
   Even the two main opposition parties in Mexico _ which accuse
PRI of cheating at the polls _ said Endara had spoken out of turn.
   Being sworn in by an invading force ``is not the best way to to
demonstrate the independence and sovereignty of Panama,'' said Luis
Alvarez, president of the conservative National Action Party or PAN.
   Sen. Cristobal Arias Solis of the leftist Democratic
Revolutionary Party described Endara's authority as ``spurious''
because of the way he came to power.

<TEXT>
   Progress has been slow in coming to
this small, dusty town, and Jose Manuel Marquez Hernandez was among
its young people who turned to the United States to seek their
future.
   For Marquez, 24, the immigrant's dream of a better life ended on
March 25 in a fire at the Happy Land social club in the Bronx, New
York City. He and six other young Hondurans were buried this week
in El Progreso, a town of 30,000.
   They were among 87 people killed in the fire. At least 78 were
Hondurans, most from the northern Atlantic coast region.
   The local victims came from poor families and had limited
choices: a lowly job at one of the U.S. fruit companies that made
Honduras the original ``banana republic;'' a dead-end job in San
Pedro Sula, a coastal industrial center of 600,000 people, or New
York, a promised land of jobs, education, opportunity.
   Marquez left six years ago, when just a teen-ager.
   ``He wrote me last month,'' said Gregorio Hernandez, his uncle.
``He had gotten his high school equivalency diploma; he was
applying to go to college.''
   Meanwhile, Marquez worked at a factory, cutting leather to make
clothing, handbags, shoes. Even at minimum wage, he earned enough
to survive and send money home to his mother.
   ``I wrote him back,'' Hernandez said. ``I said: become a
professional. A professional never goes hungry. A professional
lands on his feet anywhere life throws him.''
   Hernandez was the first person in his family of nine children to
finish high school. ``My three older brothers only finished the
eighth grade because back then there wasn't a high school here and
my father didn't have the money to send them to San Pedro Sula,''
Hernandez said.
   The brothers worked for the Tela Railroad Co., a subsidiary of
Chiquita Brands, which has extensive banana plantations in Honduras.
   Hernandez became a supervisor at a textile factory in San Pedro
Sula and assumed the leadership of the extended family clan because
of his education and his job in the big city.
   Wanting something better for his own children and those of his
brothers and sisters, he sent his daughter and Marquez to New York
to live with relatives.
   ``He never once failed with his monthly money for his mother and
his brothers and sister,'' said Hernandez.
   When Marquez's older sister, one of four children, started
college in San Pedro Sula, Marquez sent her a new typewriter. When
he came home for Christmas, he brought gifts: a book for an aunt,
sunglasses for his twin younger brothers, a small stereo for the
family, money for his mother, who has been separated from his
father for years.
   ``He was her sole support,'' said Hernandez.
   Marquez's Christmas visit was the first since he left El
Progreso.
   Last Sunday he returned in a slate blue coffin on a Red Cross
charter jet that carried the bodies of 47 other Hondurans as well.
   The Hernandez clan and neighborhood friends met him, as they had
at Christmas.
   ``We've had to borrow money to pay for the funeral and the plot
in the cemetery, about 1,200 lempiras ($300),'' said Hernandez.
``We're not rich. but we had to give him a proper burial.''
   At the crowded cemetery in El Progreso, a boyhood friend, Jose
Cardenas, 24, perched on one of the simple, cement-covered graves
painted pink, blue and white and overrun with weeds and dust from
unpaved streets.
   Cardenas had also gone to New York, but was deported last year
as an illegal alien.
   ``Leaving here for New York is a change of life for the better,
because there is nothing here,'' he said as Marquez's funeral
procession arrived.
   ``You stay here and do this,'' he said, pointing to a rag-clad
grave digger, ``or you go to New York.''

   The landlord of a social club destroyed in an
arson fire that claimed 87 lives surrendered Tuesday on an arrest
warrant issued 14 months ago when he failed to appear on charges of
safety violations.
   The building owner, Alex DiLorenzo III, could face 90 days in
jail and a $5,000 fine if convicted of knowingly allowing an
illegal club in his building.
   The Happy Land Social Club was destroyed March 25 when a Cuban
refugee allegedly torched the place after a fight with his
girlfriend, police said. He has been charged with 87 murders.
   DiLorenzo is accused of lacking a club permit and failing to
install sprinklers and emergency lights. He was released without
bail by Bronx Criminal Court Judge Harold Enten, with a hearing set
for April 20, police said. He is accused of lacking a club permit
and failing to install sprinklers and emergency lights.
   The city ordered the club closed in November 1988, to no avail.
Officials said they had notified DiLorenzo in writing of the
violations; on Feb. 3, 1989, when he failed to appear for a
hearing, the warrant for his arrest was issued by Criminal Court
Judge James E. Robinson.

<TEXT>
   An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the
Richter scale rocked Nicaragua and neighboring Costa Rica on
Tuesday, causing panic in Managua and along its Pacific coast.
Authorities said they had no reports of casualties.
   The quake, which began at 5:57 p.m. (6:57 p.m. EDT), caused
damage to a building and pool in the new beach resort of
Montelimar, where five Central American presidents are holding a
two-day meeting to negotiate peace in the region.
   One of the seven swimming pools and the still-unfinished complex
center in Montelimar sustained serious cracks from the intensity of
the quake. The other pools swayed from the 30-second tremor, and
water spilled over the sides in small waves.
   The U.S. Geological Survey Earthquake Information Center in
Golden, Colo., said a preliminary reading showed the earthquake
occurred off the coast of Costa Rica near the Nicaragua border with
a magnitude of 6.5.
   The USGS spokesman said the epicenter was about 70 miles south
of Managua and 175 miles northwest of San Jose, Costa Rica. He said
the quake was felt throughout most of Nicaragua, northern Costa
Rica and even in San Jose.
   Several aftershocks followed about 15 minutes later.
   In Managua, people fled into the streets in fear, and the
National Legislature suspended its session. The downtown part of
the capital was razed and 10,000 were killed by an earthquake in
1972.
   There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties in Costa
Rica.
   In Montelimar, outgoing President Daniel Ortega and
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro were walking down the
stairs together from a meeting with the presidents of Guatemala,
Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica when the stairway started
swaying.
   The two Nicaraguan leaders waited until the earth stopped
rocking, then continued without incident to a hall on the ground
floor where they planned a news conference with about 100
journalists.
   Long-distance telephone operators said the quake was felt as far
away as Corinto, in the northwest.
   The devastating quake last October in the San Francisco Bay area
measured 7.1.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated
areas, and one measuring 7 is considered a major earthquake,
capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

   Dixon was among only the 11 senators who voted against the
legislation.
   ``I cannot vote for legislation that will destroy the livlihood
of thousands of hard working men and women ... that will bring
economic ruin to communities throughout Appalachian and midwestern
states,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who unsuccessfully had
sought financial help for coal miners affected by the bill.
   The final vote came after a brief flurry of excitement over an
attempt by Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., at the last minute to change
the permit requirements of the bill and make it easier for
businesses to comply. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., called the 34-page
amendment ``an ambush'' that would hamper enforcement of the new
requirements and hinder civil suits against polluters.
   The amendment was narrowly defeated by a vote of 51-49.

   A fan obsessed with actress Sharon
Gless pleaded innocent Tuesday to breaking into her home and
holding police at bay with a rifle.
   Joni Leigh Penn, 30, entered the pleas before Municipal Court
Commissioner Gerald T. Richardson, who set an April 12 preliminary
hearing.
   Ms. Penn remained silent during the 10-minute hearing, with her
attorney answering questions for her.
   She was charged with two counts of residential burglary to
commit theft. Both charges included firearms allegations. If
convicted on both counts Ms. Penn could face 10 years in prison.
   Prosecutors sought $1 million bail for Ms. Penn, but Richardson
decided after hearing arguments to set no bail in the case.
   Ms. Penn was arrested March 30 after a seven-hour standoff with
police officers. She was armed with a .22-caliber rifle but there
was no shooting.
   Miss Gless, who played a tough police detective on the old
``Cagney and Lacey'' television series, was staying at another home
and was not at the single-story stucco residence at the time of the
break-in.

Seoul, according to an Air Force press release.
   The pilot, Capt. Stephen R. Howell, 34, was reported in good
condition after ejecting from the jet.
   At the time of the accident, the plane was on final approach for
landing at the air base before it went down about seven miles south
of the base, the release said.
   It said Howell is assigned to the 80th Tactical Fighter Squadron
and that his family lives in Longview, Texas.
   The Yonhap News Agency said the plane crashed into a rice paddy
and was destroyed.
   Cause of the accident has not been determined.

   Columbia University and two businessmen were
last-minute additions Tuesday to a lawsuit over ownership of gold
ingots and coins found 1{ miles deep on the ocean floor.
   U.S. District Judge Richard B. Kellam ruled the school and the
businessmen could intervene in the lawsuit to establish ownership
of the treasure that went down with the SS Central America in 1857,
160 miles off the South Carolina coast.
   The trial began Tuesday with testimony after both sides agreed
to dispense with opening arguments.
   On one side is the Columbus-America Discovery Group, which used
space age technology to find and recover the treasure; on the other
is a group of insurance companies, which paid out claims 132 years
ago for the insured cargo and argue it still belongs to them.
   Now, attorneys for the New York City school said data provided
by one of their researchers led the Columbus-America Group to the
site of the shipwreck, resting 1{ miles deep in the Atlantic Ocean.
   John Richardson, an attorney for the school, said a sonar survey
by Dr. William Ryan, an oceanographer at Columbia, was done for two
businessmen in search of the wreck in 1984. Richardson said Harry
John, who once held 47 percent of the stock in Miller Brewing Co.,
and Jack Grimm, a Texas oil man, funded Ryan's research.
   Richardson said Ryan later exchanged the data with Thomas G.
Thompson, a president of Columbus-America, and that Thompson used
the data to locate the wreck site. The university claims
Columbus-America then misled the public by saying the wreck was
discovered when it hadn't been. Based on Columbus-America claims,
Ryan informed John and Grimm that the search was over and they had
been beaten.
   Attorneys for Columbus-America denied the Ryan data was of any
use.
   Thompson said sonar surveys in 1986 pinpointed one target that
``we felt very good about.'' The Ohio-based group recovered
artifacts from the site consistent with the time period the Central
America sank. On the basis of those artifacts, Kellam gave the
group exclusive rights in 1987 to the site.
   Thompson said that while reviewing the 1986 data in preparation
for a 1988 search, experts found a second target that looked even
better than the first. Since the second target was on the way to
the original search site, Thompson said he decided to test out the
equipment on the second target.
   The new sonar survey show the second site, 33 miles from the
first, was most probably the Central America. Further surveys
showed it was.
   Richardson argued the second site was one identified by Ryan,
and asserted the New York City school had an interest in the gold.
   ``It's a lot like an astronomer taking a picture of the sky.
That picture might contain an unknown planet, but the astronomer
never sees it. Then, 30 years later, after exhaustive research, a
second astronomer identifies the unknown planet, and the first
tries to claim he found it 30 years earlier,'' said Richard T.
Robol, a Norfolk attorney representing Columbus-America.
   It was unclear how long the trial might take or when a decision
could be expected. Attorneys originally said the case would take at
least a week to try.
   When the Central America sank in a hurricane, it was loaded with
passengers and gold from the California gold fields. The value of
the cargo was estimated at $1.6 million at the time. The
Columbus-America Discovery Group estimates the current value could
reach $1 billion.
   More than a ton of gold has been recovered. Columbus-America
officials estimate more than 2 tons remain on the ocean's floor.
Efforts to raise the rest of the treasure are on hold awaiting the
outcome of the legal battle, Columbus-America officials said.

<HEAD>Government Orders 20 Areas to Cut Budgets After Tax Revolt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British officials, trying to limit the upheaval
caused by its unpopular new local government tax, on Tuesday
ordered the 20 highest-spending authorities to impose lower taxes
and cut budgets.
   The move came in the aftermath of violence in central London on
Saturday night after a rally against the so-called poll tax turned
into a mob riot through the capital's West End.
   Environment Secretary Chris Patten set the top-spending
authorities a 28-day deadline to reduce the tax for this fiscal
year. If they refuse, Patten will impose the cuts.
   ``It is deplorable that local authorities have chosen to budget
at these levels putting an unacceptable burden on the local
people,'' Patten told the House of Commons. ``It is little wonder
that strong feelings have been expressed up and down the country.''
   The opposition socialist Labor Party described the move as a
``final admission of the poll tax's failure.''
   Labor controls 18 of the councils targeted and the other two
have no party with overall control. No council run by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party was included in the
list.
   ``This charge-capping list will be universally regarded as a
political fix,'' said Labor's Bryan Gould, who leads the socialist
party's attack on the tax _ officially known as the community
charge.
   ``They (the government) have given up trying to make the poll
tax work ... their sole and squalid aim now is to shift the blame
for the whole poll tax fiasco for which they alone are
responsible,'' said Gould.
   The cuts ordered by Patten ranged from $161 lopped off the $691
tax levied by a west London district, Hammersmith and Fulham, to a
modest $46 off the $733 tax set by St. Helens in northwest England.
   Patten said he selected the districts, out of more than 400 in
England in Wales, because their budgets were the highest above
government targets.
   Councilors from the districts singled out described the move as
vindictive and said they will mount legal challenges. Some warned
they would have to cut services, ranging from running schools and
old age homes to garbage collection.
   Mrs. Thatcher's original aim was to undermine support for
Labor-run councils because they set high tax rates. But instead
both Labor and Tory councils have set tax levels over the
government targets and Mrs. Thatcher is being blamed.
   The average tax level, including in Conservative-run districts,
is $592 a person, about one-third higher than the government target.
   Both government and Labor lawmakers have condemned Saturday's
riot in which mobs tore though London's West End, burning cars,
looting, smashing shop windows and terrifying shoppers,
theatergoers and sightseers.
   Police say the violence, which began with an attempt to storm
Mrs. Thatcher's 10 Downing Street residence, was organized by
extreme left-wing groups and anarchists.
   The riot appears likely to benefit Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``You can barely conceal your delight at the diversion the
uproar provided,'' Labor leader Neil Kinnock declared in angry
exchanges with Mrs. Thatcher in the Commons before Patten's
announcement.
   ``When it comes to extremists the difference is this: I fight
them, you need them,'' Kinnock added, his voice nearly drowned by
Tory lawmakers shouts of protest.
   Mrs. Thatcher retorted that Kinnock talked ``nonsense.''
   She argues that the tax, which came into effect April 1, is
fairer because most of Britain's 38 million adults are liable
instead of only property owners under the previous system of local
taxes.
   But the tax has become a major political liability for the
government, now trailing Labor by more than 20 points in popularity
ratings.
   Most families are paying about one-third more than previously,
but it benefits people who live alone and paid the same as
neighboring households of three or four adults.

   The presidents of Central America
on Tuesday called for the Contra rebels to begin disbanding now and
surrender their weapons to international monitors.
   The arms should be destroyed immediately in the presence of
observers from the five Central America countries, the presidents
said in a joint statement.
   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto of Nicaragua read the statement
at a news conference at the close of a two-day meeting on Central
American peace. The sessions in Montelimar, a beach resort 40 miles
from Managua, brought together the presidents of Nicaragua,
Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala.
   The close of the summit was jarred by a strong earthquake
measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale that rocked the capital,
Managua, the Pacific coast area and parts of neighboring Costa
Rica. The resort itself sustained structural damage to a complex
center building and one of its swimming pools.
   Contra rebel leaders based in Honduras had already announced
Monday they would disband by April 18, a week before conservative
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro takes office in
Nicaragua.
   Several thousand rebels inside Nicaragua are expected to follow
suit, rallying at predetermined ``safety zones'' in line with an
agreement reached by the five presidents at a previous summit.
   The demobilization will end nine years of Contra war, supported
by the United States, against outgoing President Daniel Ortega's
leftist Sandinista regime. Mrs. Chamorro won by a landslide in
elections Feb. 25.
   According to the presidents' agreement announced Tuesday, the
demobilization and surrender of the weapons ``should start
immediately and end by April 25 at the latest.''
   All rebel weapons surrendered to the U.N. peacekeepers and other
international monitors ``should be destroyed on the spot in the
presence of representatives from other Central American governments
invited for that purpose,'' the agreement said.
   The earthquake began just as Ortega and Chamorro were walking
down the stairs together from the meeting hall after the last
session of the summit.
   They both halted and waited until the earth stopped rocking.
Then they walked down to a hall on the ground floor where the news
conference was held with about 100 journalists.

   Drug traffickers killed up to 10 police
officers and wounded at least eight Monday and Tuesday in
Colombia's cocaine capital of Medellin, authorities said. At least
nine attackers were reported slain.
   Gunmen kidnapped a federal senator, and a leading Bogota
newspaper left its editorial column blank after threats from the
traffickers.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco pressed on in its
U.S.-backed war against the drug dealers. It announced it would
soon extradite three more drug suspects, including a congressman,
El Tiempo newspaper reported.
   Last week, the traffickers threatened to explode a five-ton bomb
in Bogota for every new extradition.
   Battles between authorities and cocaine barons intensified over
the past week after the government renewed its program of
extraditing drug suspects to the United States. In January, the
Medellin cocaine cartel had claimed it was defeated and curtailed
attacks.
   The military also announced Tuesday the capture of Marlon Perez
Madrid, who allegedly ran the Medellin cartel's murder squads in
Envigado, four miles south of the city.
   Envigado, with 80,000 residents, is under martial law. The
government disbanded the town's police force last week, accusing
nine of its 27 officers of working for cartel leader Pablo Escobar.
   In the northwestern city of Medellin, terrorists working for the
cartel killed nine police officers Monday and Tuesday, Medellin
police spokeswoman Ana Arestizal said. At least nine of the
terrorists died when police returned fire.
   National police put the number of police killed at 10.
   At least eight police officers were wounded, police said.
   The chief of the national police, Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla,
told reporters late Tuesday police reinforcements will be sent to
Medellin.
   Gunmen on Tuesday killed a police bodyguard for Mayor-elect Omar
Florez, an official statement said. Florez, who takes office in
August, is a member of the governing Liberal Party.
   The bodyguard was standing outside his home in Medellin when two
men on a motorcycle fired. They took the victim's gun before
fleeing, police said.
   Hours earlier, assailants threw grenades at a police patrol in
the Medellin suburb of La Estrella. Four policemen were injured,
the statement said.
   Assailants killed two police officers on Tuesday in the suburbs
of Copacabana and Bello, Ms. Arestizal told The Associated Press by
telephone. She said a third person, not yet identified, also died
in the Copacabana attack.
   Last week, police told the AP the Medellin cartel had offered
$4,290 for each death of a national police officer in Bogota and
Medellin.
   The cartel also offered to pay $100,000 for each member of a
2,000-man anti-narcotics police force they kill, police said. No
members of that force have been killed, though.
   Two gunmen pulled a federal senator, Frederico Estrada, from his
car early Tuesday in Medellin and fled with him in another vehicle,
Police Chief Col. Alberto Otalora told a news conference.
   Anonymous callers to local news media said the Medellin cartel
kidnapped Estrada and would release him soon with a message for the
government.
   Otalora said Estrada had opposed traffickers' attempts to
persuade the government to open peace talks with them.
   Last week, the Medellin cartel threatened to resume killing
government officials, judges, policemen and the owners of
Colombia's second largest newspaper, El Espectador, of Bogota.
   On Tuesday, the morning daily said in a front-page statement it
would suspend its entire editorial column until the government
gives the paper adequate protection.
   The editorial column, often filled with denunciations of
traffickers, was a strip of blank, white paper two columns wide and
12 inches long.
   The Medellin cartel killed El Espectador's publisher, Guillermo
Cano, in a submachine-gun attack in 1987. In the last four months,
six El Espectador employees have been killed by traffickers' hit
squads.
   More than 200 people have been killed in bombings and other
terrorist attacks since the latest government crackdown began in
August, when drug lords killed a leading presidential candidate.
   El Tiempo newspaper said the new suspects to be extradited
include Jacobo Marino Mendez, a congressman for the northern state
of Magdalena. He is wanted by a Puerto Rican court on charges of
distributing marijuana in U.S. territory.
   The government has extradited 15 drug suspects since August.

   Supervisors and outside workers filled in for
11,000 striking workers Tuesday at the largest U.S. health
maintenance organization, which said it had potential substitutes
on standby as far away as Oregon.
   In the second day of the walkout, services were cut and some
clinics closed by Kaiser Permanente of Southern California, which
has more than 1.5 million members.
   ``I've cleaned as many toilets (in two days) as I've ever
cleaned in my life,'' said Elisabeth Breegle, who usually spends
her days in meetings at Kaiser Permanente's largest facility, on
Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.
   Ms. Breegle, a construction coordinator, said many supervisors
were working 12-hour shifts.
   ``We've all been called. We've all been chosen,'' she said.
   Kaiser Permanente, like other HMOs, offers its members medical
care for a prepaid, fixed price, rather than on a pay-per-visit
basis. Its emergency services were unaffected, but some patients
had appointments postponed or moved to open clinics, officials said.
   About 150 Kaiser patients had been transferred to community
hospitals, Kaiser spokeswoman Janice Seib said.
   No contract talks were scheduled with the striking nurses,
technicians and maintenance workers. Negotiations with a federal
mediator ended Saturday without agreement between Pasadena-based
Kaiser Permanente and Service Employees International Union Local
399.
   Workers defied a union negotiating team's recommendation and
rejected a $44 million, three-year contract offer Friday by a
3,067-to-1,474 vote.
   The company had guaranteed a 5 percent raise the first year and
3 percent the second and third years. Top pay for a licensed
vocational nurse under the old contract was $13.01 per hour,
according to Kaiser.
   The walkout began Monday and affected hospitals in Anaheim, Los
Angeles, West Los Angeles, Panorama City, Woodland Hills, Harbor
City, and Bellflower, and more than 40 satellite medical offices.
   Seib said about 1,100 Kaiser workers had been brought in from
non-struck Kaiser facilities in Fontana, Riverside, San Diego and
Northern California. Additional workers were on standby in Oregon,
added Kaiser spokeswoman Jayne Marlatt.

<HEAD>Two Scientists Claim to Have Produced Cold Fusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POCATELLO, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Idaho State University physicists
claimed Tuesday that they produced a cold fusion reaction with a
different element than those used in experiments by two chemists
from Utah and England.
   Physics professor Kenneth Faler said he and Stanley Vegors
produced the reaction March 13 by saturating a small rod of
titanium metal in a bottle of deuterium gas cooled to minus 300
degrees Fahrenheit.
   The device produced bursts of neutrons, ``presumably the fusion
of two deuterons into as yet undetermined products,'' Faler told a
news conference.
   A deuteron is the nucleus of an atom of deuterium, an isotope of
hydrogen. In one type of fusion reaction, two deuterium nuclei fuse
to form helium.
   ``This is a physical process in which deuterium gas stored in a
bottle is absorbed into titanium metal at low temperatures and low
pressure and as the metal heats up, it emits neutrons,'' Faler said.
   ``It appears we have produced cold fusion reactions in a
different way,'' he claimed. ``There are now two techniques.''
   The two researchers were spurred by reports a year ago that
chemist B. Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and British
colleague Martin Fleishmann of the University of Southampton had
achieved sustained nuclear fusion in a seemingly simple experiment.
   The Pons-Fleischmann device consists of a palladium electrode
wrapped in platinum wire and immersed in deuterium oxide, or heavy
water, then charged with electricity.
   Pons and Fleischmann's seeming breakthrough was questioned when
researchers in other laboratories had trouble duplicating their
results. While many scientists say they doubt cold fusion exists,
experiments continue around the world.
   The Idaho State researchers observed neutrons using instruments
at the school's Low-Energy Accelerator Facility Laboratory.
   ``The emission of neutrons is generally believed by the
scientific community to be an almost positive guarantee that
nuclear reactions have taken place,'' Faler said. ``Such a
reaction, if it takes place on a large scale, might be able to
produce enormous amounts of energy,'' Faler said.
   John Knox, acting director of the Idaho State physics
department, said that although the fusion experiments are
important, science requires that results must be repeatable.
   ``I'm still skeptical about cold fusion in the original sense
that was talked about a year ago. But it appears something is
happening,'' he said.
   The Idaho report, which has not been published in any scientific
journals, apparently confirms the discovery reported recently by a
group of Italian scientists working at the Frascati research
laboratory near Rome, Faler said.
   The ISU information was compared with the Italians' findings in
a March conference at the National Cold Fusion Institute in Utah.
   Four labs worldwide have seen similar results. Scientists at the
Los Alamos facility in New Mexico and the Bhabha Atomic Research
Center near Bombay, India have viewed neutron bursts under similar
conditions.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A soldier carrying grenades seized
a New York-bound jumbo jet at Haiti's airport and threatened to
blow it up Tuesday if he was not flown to the United States.
   A radio report, however, said the 20-year-old soldier let the
small number of passengers and crew aboard American Airlines Flight
658 get off. Officials confirmed he was alone on board the craft.
   Pvt. Pierre Gerald, an airport security guard, boarded the
Airbus A300 on Monday afternoon as it was preparing to leave for
New York, said Radio Haiti Inter and an American Airlines spokesman.
   The radio said the young soldier had grenades when he
commandeered the plane in an attempt to desert the army after an
officer reprimanded him for alleged insubordination. It said Gerald
had been in the army two years.
   U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams, Minister of the Interior Joseph
Maxi and Police Commissioner Jean-Claude Duperval went to the
airport Tuesday.
   After a popular uprising drove Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril from power
last month, Adams reportedly helped persuade the fallen military
ruler to leave the country. Haiti now has a civilian government.
   The radio said negotiations with military and airport officials
Monday night were fruitless and Gerald spent the night alone in the
aircraft. No flights were arriving or taking off from the airport
Tuesday.
   On Tuesday night, it appeared authorities would let Gerald sleep
inside the empty jet a second night. No special security measures
were taken at the airport.
   A military expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
doubted the soldier could blow up the plane with grenades because
the engines were turned off and the fuel remained under the wings.
He said seats would probably cushion a grenade explosion and he
doubted that fragments could reach the fuel tank.
   The Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste said in a telephone call from the
Haitian capital Tuesday that he found out about the incident when
he went to board a plane Tuesday and discovered the airport closed.
According to Jean-Juste, the soldier had grenades and possibly an
Uzi submachine gun.
   Gerald gave officials until noon Tuesday to fly him to Miami. A
few minutes before the deadline, he appeared in the plane's doorway
and shot once into the tarmac, Haiti Inter said.
   No injuries were reported.
   American Airlines spokesman Al Becker said Gerald got on board
by means of a catering truck that was servicing the plane.
   In June, four unarmed Haitians tried to hijack to New York an
Antillean Airlines flight en route from Haiti to the Dutch
Caribbean island of Curacao.
   The plane landed in Curacao, where the Haitians were arrested.
The airline said the plane's captain fooled them into believing
Curacao was New York.

   President Fidel Castro of Cuba told the United
States on Tuesday not to interfere with his jamming of Voice of
America television broadcasts because it could lead to war.
   The hard-line Communist leader was referring to U.S.-funded
Voice of America programs beamed from Miami to Cuba. The island's
government has been jamming them since they started March 27.
   ``If the U.S. undertakes a surgical operation against the
systems of interference of its anti-Cuban television, we will try
and make the surgeon come out of it as badly as possible,'' the
Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina reported Castro as
saying.
   At a news conference, ``he warned that Cuba can also carry out
surgical operations and remarked that such a U.S. action could end
in war,'' Prensa Latina said.
   The dispatch, monitored in Mexico City, only paraphrased
Castro's words. It gave no direct quotes.
   Castro said Cuba ``seeks no military confrontation.'' But he
said it ``does not fear the U.S. and is ready to confront them on
any ground,'' the dispatch added.
   In other remarks to an Associated Press reporter and other
journalists in Havana, Castro raised the possibility Tuesday night
that his government will retaliate by blocking U.S. radio
transmissions to the island.
   Speaking for more than two hours, Castro assailed the Voice of
America TV project as a ``gross instrument of subversion.''
   Although he did not announce new responses, he said Cuba
reserves the right to exercise that option if ``this aggression
continues.''
   Castro left the impression that one of the moves under
consideration would involve Radio Marti, the 5-year-old Voice of
America project that broadcasts news and entertainment to Cuban
listeners.
   ``TV Marti can make Radio Marti surface again,'' Castro said.
``We can't exclude this possibility. This problem is still
unsettled.''
   Previously, Castro threatened to retaliating by interfering with
American broadcast signals in Florida.
   On Monday, President Bush hailed TV Marti as the latest U.S.
effort to broadcast ``the truth'' to Communist countries.
   The television station is named after Jose Marti, a hero of
Cuban independence.
   The Cuban dispatch Tuesday reported, ``Fidel Castro said the
U.S. decision to name its anti-Cuban television channel with the
name of the national hero Jose Marti is the same as if he we named
a garbage can `George Washington.'''

   The White House said Tuesday it will not
nominate Housing Secretary Jack Kemp's choice to lead a new housing
agency. Kemp's selection, Mary K. Bush, is under investigation for
awarding no-bid contracts to friends.
   Ms. Bush met Kemp later Tuesday and accepted his offer to stay
on as managing director of the new agency, the Federal Housing
Finance Board, said her spokesman Joseph Slye.
   She will remain in charge of its day-to-day activities, but
without a vote on its five-member board, which controls up to $100
million a year in new housing money.
   The administration said Ms. Bush would not be nominated as
chairwoman because she was seeking a fulltime post and the White
House has decided the agency's board should serve part time.
   ``The interests were not compatible,'' said White House deputy
press secretary Stephen Hart. He echoed comments from Kemp aides in
saying the investigation of Ms. Bush's conduct regarding the
contracts was considered ``a separate matter'' from the question of
her nomination.
   Ms. Bush has been serving as acting director of the new agency
for seven months awaiting her promised nomination as fulltime
chairwoman. During that wait, however, Kemp aides decided to push
for a part-time board and instead create the fulltime position of
managing director for Ms. Bush.
   As the only named board member, Kemp has remained in sole
control of the agency.
   Kemp asked HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams last week to
review three no-bid contracts Ms. Bush awarded during the past
seven months as part of her effort to get the fledgling agency
running. Adams' report is expected later this week.
   Unclear on Tuesday was whether the offer of the managing
director job would be withdrawn if Adams criticizes Ms. Bush in his
report.
   Several Kemp aides did not return telephone messages.
   The three contracts were given by Ms. Bush to friends with whom
she worked in the Reagan administration. Although the Housing
Finance Board by law does not have to put contracts out for
competitive bidding, Kemp aides have criticized Ms. Bush for
awarding the no-bid contracts, including one to Wendell Gunn,
Kemp's former chief of staff at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Kemp aides insist that the housing secretary did not know about
the no-bid contracts until two weeks ago. HUD Undersecretary Alfred
DelliBovi also said he first became aware of the contracts two
weeks ago, as did Mary Brunette, Kemp's closest advisor.
   Gunn, however, insists he told Kemp in November and offered to
end the agreement if it bothered Kemp. And DelliBovi, in an
internal memo to Ms. Brunette and five other Kemp aides two months
ago, listed ``Wendell'' among those being paid by the Housing
Finance Board.
   The DelliBovi memo, obtained by The Associated Press, also
offers evidence that at least DelliBovi at HUD wanted Ms. Bush to
leave the agency as far back as Feb. 5 despite repeated public
assertions that she remained Kemp's choice for the job.
   ``If he goes let's hope he takes Mary,'' DelliBovi wrote after a
passage about the plans of ``Wendell'' to leave the agency.
   The Housing Finance Board was created as part of the savings and
loan industry bailout to oversee the 12 regional Federal Home Loan
Banks and to funnel a percentage of their profits each year into
affordable housing programs _ $78 million this year and rising to
$100 million a year.
   Ms. Bush, according to sources, has protested the decision to
make the board part time. She left a vice presidency at the Federal
National Mortgage Association for the Housing Board job after being
lobbied by Kemp.
   When details of the DelliBovi memo were first reported last
week, HUD sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
Kemp deputies had determined the housing secretary would have more
influence over a part-time board because of his Cabinet ranking.
   Members of Congress who authored the law creating the agency
said they envisioned a full-time board. But it is unclear whether
they will resist the administration attempt to name a part-time
panel.

<TEXT>
   Mark White, whose gubernatorial comeback
bid died in the Democratic primary, accused Treasurer Ann Richards
on Tuesday of dirty politics and likened her behavior to Gestapo
chief Heinrich Himmler's.
   ``I will never endorse Ann Richards. I will never support Ann
Richards. And I will never vote for Ann Richards,'' White told
reporters.
   White stopped short of endorsing state Attorney General Jim
Mattox over Ms. Richards in the April 10 Democratic runoff for
governor, but said he would vote in that race. He declined to
criticize Mattox's tactics during the mudslinging primary.
   ``I've always thought he was one of the toughest campaigners
I've ever seen,'' White said, ``but what Ann Richards has done
would make Himmler blush.''
   Mattox said Tuesday night that he has signed statements from
witnesses alleging Ms. Richards has used illegal drugs.
   ``Yes, I do, as a matter of fact,'' Mattox told reporters
questioning him about proof for allegations he has made regarding
Ms. Richards.
   But Mattox refused to say who his informants are.
   Mattox made the comments during a televised half-hour ``debate''
that Ms. Richards declined to attend, citing a previous engagement
in Austin.
   Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, has refused to answer
directly the question of her alleged drug use, saying she has not
used any ``mood-altering'' drugs in 10 years.
   ``My response has been my message to the people out there that
if you need help you can get help,'' Ms. Richards earlier in March.
   Ms. Richards did not immediately answer three messages left on
an answering machine at her headquarters, and calls to Ms.
Richards' press secretary and campaign manager were not immediately
returned.
   Before the debate, she said, ``I have a big rally in Austin that
we had planned for a very long time. The television people knew
that. We told them that I couldn't come.''
   White said he wouldn't vote for Ms. Richards should she win the
nomination to challenge Republican Clayton Williams.
   ``If she gets the nomination it will be without my help. And I
think if she's able to be elected, she'll have it in the same
fashion,'' White said.
   The former governor blasted Ms. Richards for TV commercials and
speeches in which she alleged he had profited from public service
and helped his old law firm obtain state bond business while he was
governor.
   ``I think I've been probably been madder from time to time, but
this one ... they pretty well ripped their britches with me,'' he
said, saying Ms. Richard had made remarks that were ``patently
false, maliciously made and she should have had better judgment.''
   In the primary, Ms. Richards captured 39 percent of the vote, to
37 percent for Mattox and 19 percent for White, who was governor
from 1983 to 1987.
   ``I feel very badly about any time there is hard feelings,'' Ms.
Richards said at a campaign stop in Mercedes before White's
comment. ``I feel badly about any personal feelings that ever get
into a campaign. I feel sure that all of those wounds will be
healed and the Democrats will be together in November.''
   Her campaign spokesman, Monte Williams, did not immediately
return calls seeking comment about White's remarks.
   White said Ms. Richards deliberately distorted his record and
ran campaign advertisements that lied about him.
   ``Ann Richards willfully and knowingly smeared me with false
accusations that she knew at the time to be untrue. She didn't do
it just once in the heat of an argument. She did it with
inexcusable regularity in the last days of the campaign,'' he said.
   He said Ms. Richards ran the dirtiest campaign he ever witnessed.
   ``I know tough politics ... I have been in some rough campaigns
in my career and I know how to dish it out and I know how to take
it,'' he said. ``But there is a difference between negative
advertising and unfounded, vicious, personal attacks that are
out-and-out lies.
   ``I think she overstepped the bounds of decency by smearing my
name in such a vicious way,'' he said.

   Reginald S. Alexander, a politician,
sports enthusiast and longtime member of the International Olympics
Committee, died Saturday at age 75.
   The cause of death was not disclosed.
   Alexander entered local politics, first in 1948 as a Nairobi
city legislator and then as mayor of the city in 1954. When Kenya

congestive heart failure at age 87.
   He began his political career at age 25 with a successful
campaign to become the youngest person to serve in the Iowa
Legislature.
   The Democrat served two terms before achieving a similar
distinction in Congress by winning election in a heavily Republican
southwest Iowa district in 1932. Wearin remained in the House until
1936, when he made an unsuccessful run for the Senate. He also
failed to win the Democratic nomination six years later.
   He wrote a series of newspaper articles about his travels in
Europe, which became the basis for his first book, ``An Iowa Farmer
Abroad.'' He followed that with other writings including a series
of essays on country living and essays for a succession of books _
``Before the Colors Fade,'' ``Along Our Country Road,'' ``I
Remember Yesteryear'' and ``Grass Grown Trails.''
   His books were cited in his induction into the Cowboy Hall of
Fame in Oklahoma City in 1985.
   A fifth book, ``A Place for Living,'' is to be published.

   Teen-agers who insist on cruising in the
city that inspired the film ``American Graffiti'' risk fines under
a pair of ordinances that won final approval on Tuesday.
   Under the new rules, which take effect May 5, motorists would
face fines of $75 to $250 for passing a designated checkpoint more
than once every four hours. Pedestrians gathered in parking lots
and along sidewalks would risk equal fines for loitering between 6
p.m. and 6 a.m.
   Officers will enforce the rules within a marked no-cruising zone
on the popular McHenry Avenue when traffic moves slower than 5 mph
or intersections are blocked.
   The ordinances do not affect the annual Graffiti Night, which
celebrates the cruising tradition in grand proportions with up to
100,000 people in 30,000 cars.
   The rules were sought by residents and business owners who
complained that the good-natured pastime of the 1950s had grown
unmanageable with the influence of drugs, gangs and vandalism.
   But the rite of passage was defended by teen-agers who grew up
with the legacy of George Lucas' 1973 film. They argued their
motives were as innocent as their parents': showing off cars and
meeting dates.

<TEXT>
   A meandering flow of molten lava from
Kilauea Volcano had residents of this coastal community packing
their belongings Tuesday and preparing to leave.
   A flow from the west, the most serious threat, advanced within
50 yards of five homes in the Kalapana Gardens subdivision,
according to Hawaii County Civil Defense spokesman Bruce Butts.
   The flow moved 200 yards during a 12-hour period ending early
Tuesday, Butts said. The flow picked up speed by mid-morning.
   Residents of 50 of the 125 homes in Kalapana Gardens evacuated
Monday, and an order affecting seven more homes was issued later
Tuesday, Butts said.
   Many residents were stoic about the encroaching lava, drinking
beer and laughing with friends while watching the molten earth edge
toward their homes.
   ``Morale is really high; we're just sticking together,'' said
Craig Heiser, who built his home in 1987.
   ``It's a little like a party atmosphere,'' he said. ``You can't
do anything about it, so you might as well enjoy it.''
   ``People who live here are emotionally prepared for it, but you
still hope it's not going to happen,'' said Donna Olson, whose home
was destroyed in the 1986 flow and lives with her three children in
a rented house threatened by the west flow.
   ``What else can you do? This is the Hawaiian style of doing
things. I just want to get it over with,'' said Julie Beardsley,
who lives in one of the five homes immediately threatened.
   Another flow, on the eastern side of the community, was moving
toward the subdivision along the path of a 1989 flow, and was about
a half-mile from nearest homes, Butts said.
   Some of the residents hired container trucks to carry their
belongings away. Many others were packing in anticipation of an
eventual evacuation order.
   ``I ran into a couple of people who didn't seem too concerned
about it, but most people are concerned and moving whatever they
can,'' said Civil Defense spokesman Allen Parker.
   Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim also ordered the Kalapana
area closed to tourists and other visitors.
   Scientists said about 650,000 cubic yards of lava was being
pumped out of the volcano's Kupaianaha Vent each day.
   Tom Wright, chief scientist at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory,
said the lava began spreading over the slope a week ago.
   ``Now it has gathered itself into a couple of significant
flows,'' he said.
   Wright said that based on the topography of the area, the two
flows could join and send a single stream of molten lava into
Kalapana Gardens.
   Since the east rift zone eruption began on Jan. 3, 1983, 76
dwellings and a national park visitor center have been destroyed,
causing more than $20 million in damage.
   Kilauea Volcano is near the southeast coast on the island of
Hawaii, which is about 200 miles from Honolulu on the island of
Oahu.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo's administration set
welfare rates so low that some families were forced into
homelessness, the state Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday.
   The high court unanimously reversed a lower court verdict and
ordered a new trial in the case of Barbara Jiggetts, a New York
City woman who complained about low welfare rates.
   The court agreed with welfare advocates who argued the shelter
allowance in the state's basic welfare grant was set far below
market rates for even the cheapest housing available.
   ``A schedule establishing assistance levels so low that it
forces large numbers of families with dependent children into
homelessness does not meet the statutory standard,'' Judge Richard
Simons wrote.
   State Social Service Commissioner Cesar Peraes, in a prepared
statement, said the state will discuss the welfare rates before a
lower court.
   Attorneys for Jiggett said they believed the Court of Appeals'
strong language in the decision would make it hard for a lower
court not to order increased welfare rates.
   ``It's a great decision and it's very important for the welfare
population of New York,'' said Allan Gropper of the state Bar
Association's Project for the Homeless of the City. He said studies
have shown as many as one-third of New York City's homeless
population had been evicted from apartments.
   Jiggetts, a single mother of three from the borough of Queens,
sued New York City social service officials in 1987 when she was
being evicted from her apartment. She has since found housing, but
other families joined the lawsuit and the jurisdiction was switched
to the state, said Matthew Diller, a lawyer for the New York Legal
Aid Society.
   Christopher Lamb, another Legal Aid Society lawyer, said the
shelter allowance for a family of four in New York City is $312 a
month. However, the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development reports the average market rate for a two-bedroom
apartment for poor people in New York City is $566.
   ``People shouldn't be sent out into the New York City market and
be told you have to find an apartment for a family of four at $312
a month,'' Lamb said. ``It's like hitting your head against the
wall.''

   Greeks will vote again Sunday, for the

   Pollsters predict the election will end like those in June and
November 1989, with no party winning enough seats to control the
government.
   Coalitions formed after last year's elections took no effective
action on foreign, domestic or economic policy. The European

of a 1985 loan.

<HEAD>Lone Scientist Provides The One Certainty In Global Warming Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   How fast will global warming raise Earth's
temperatures? How much will temperatures rise? Will coastal cities
be flooded by rising sea levels?
   At the center of the stormy debate over the greenhouse effect,
one bright area of calm remains: Charles Keeling's curve.
   The curve is a record of the slow, inexorable climb of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere during the past 30 years.
   Keeling, a chemist at the University of California at San Diego,
has made it his life's work to develop the most detailed and
accurate measurements possible of carbon dioxide.
   Carbon dioxide traps the sun's heat in the atmosphere, and
Keeling's curve charting its rise is at the heart of the debate
over how much the Earth's temperature is likely to rise, and how
fast.
   ``Today this ever-lengthening record, Keeling's Curve, provides
a sort of time-lapse X-ray movie of the workings of the spheres, a
surprising inside view of our planet's metabolism,'' says writer
Jonathan Weiner.
   Weiner tells the story of the self-effacing Keeling for the
first time in a lucid and compelling book, ``The Next One Hundred
Years.'' Keeling, Weiner says, is measuring ``the breathing of the
world.''
   Keeling's findings are sobering. The amount of carbon dioxide in
the air has increased by 12 percent just since 1958.
   Thanks to Keeling's thoroughness, that figure is ironclad.
Researchers debate the effects of that rise, but they don't argue
with Keeling's numbers.
   For his part, Keeling sticks to his work. He hasn't played a
large role in the national debate, which has grown in intensity as
the 20th anniversary of Earth Day approaches April 22 and concern
over the environment increases.
   But he does have words of warning for those who wave off the
fuss and argue that the Earth's temperature may not be climbing.
   ``To suppose it isn't going to go up at all would indicate that
somehow the Earth just naturally gets this warm and then stops
warming,'' Keeling said in a telephone interview.
   ``There shouldn't be any reason we know of that the Earth
wouldn't continue to warm up,'' he said. ``Furthermore, we know
from geological history that it was warmer once upon a time. So
logic suggests that the greenhouse warming has to take place. But
how much warming? And how soon? What's demanded now by political
realities is some fairly hard numbers, and those are not
forthcoming.''
   The average temperature of the Earth is about 60 degrees
Fahrenheit, Keeling said. With no carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,
it would be 0 degrees, and the Earth would be a frozen wasteland
unable to support human life.
   The rise in carbon dioxide is due largely to the increasing use
of fossil fuels _ coal and oil _ during the industrial age, Keeling
said. As carbon dioxide has risen, the production and burning of
fossil fuels also has increased, he said.
   ``In fact, the shape of the (carbon dioxide) curve looks very
much like the shape of the curve for fossil fuel production,''
Keeling said.
   Research also suggests the Earth's temperature is rising, but
researchers can't be sure. Despite all the concern about global
warming, no one is making an effort to measure temperatures the way
Keeling measured carbon dioxide.
   ``There is no explicit program to measure air temperatures to
look for these changes,'' he said. Airport temperatures are
distorted because they are taken close to cities.
   ``The way around that is to establish some very good stations
that are not near cities,'' he said.
   A government agricultural weather monitoring network that could
be adapted for that purpose is being cut back to save money,
Keeling said.
   ``They're compromising the system we already have just at the
time you'd like to know if it's getting warmer,'' he said.
   Keeling now is busy trying to determine how variations in the
sun's heat affect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As always, he
sticks to the data.
   ``I don't think I'm in a position to make a strong stand on the
greenhouse warming effect,'' he said.
   But he does place himself with those who ``see danger ahead.''
   ``There are people who say the Earth is robust and there's a
technological fix for almost anything,'' he said. Keeling is not
among them.
   ``I do subscribe to the position that most of the things we
would do if we were worried about the greenhouse effect are worth
doing _ for instance, conserving energy,'' he said.
   Beyond that, Keeling won't venture an opinion where he doesn't
have sound, scientific data to back him up.
   How much will Earth's temperatures rise, and how fast?
   ``I have personal feelings on it, but they tend to change as I
hear what other people say,'' he said. ``I can be pushed around
like all the rest of you as new facts come to light.''

<BYLINE>Peter O'Toole In CBS Movie and Pondering Book
^By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter O'Toole once planned to be a newspaperman.
On the positive side, he's been puttering around with what
old-school newspapermen always claim they're puttering around with:
a book.
   He beams and nods when asked if it might be his thoughts on
friends and life, perhaps written in the style of a pal, Spike
Milligan, whose first such effort was entitled, ``Hitler: My Part
In His Downfall.''
   The title of O'Toole's tome?
   ``Loitering With Intent,'' says the actor. He would have much to
write about. He has loitered and taken the waters with hearty
companions like Richard Burton, Richard Harris and John Huston, and
tells wonderful tales about all.
   Has he set himself a deadline for the book? O'Toole, who no
longer takes the waters, shook his head. ``Not a deadline, a start
line,'' he said.
   He was a bit weary when interviewed. He'd risen at dawn in
London and zipped across the Atlantic via Concorde jet to help
drumbeat for ``Crossing To Freedom,'' a two-hour CBS film. He left
the next day for a film in Tunisia.
   In the CBS movie, airing Sunday, he plays a sad, grumpy old
Englishman who reluctantly shepherds seven children to safety early
in World War II when Hitler's armies invade France.
   Upon arriving here to tout the film, O'Toole taped an interview
for ``CBS This Morning.'' Then he was shepherded to the United
Nations, where the United Nations Children's International Fund
hailed the movie and served him lunch.
   Then he and a squad of urchins posed for pictures, sticking out
their tongues for one shot. Then came more interviews, some with
more intense grilling about his 1962 rush to fame as T.E. Lawrence,
the sandy mystic warrior dramatized in David Lean's Oscar-winning
``Lawrence of Arabia.''
   O'Toole, still so gaunt he'd be marked absent if he turned
sideways, was good-natured and gracious about it all. Like many
who've begun on the British stage, he realizes publicity is part of
the actor's territory.
   But he isn't sure why he became an actor. His first desire was
to fight Hitler. That would have been difficult, though; he was
only 8 when the war began. So he did the next best thing.
   At 16, he went to work at a newspaper in Yorkshire, England,
where he'd grown up after his family left Ireland. ``I did love it
_ we shot out four editions a day,'' he says of his days as an
ink-stained wretch.
   O'Toole, who still has pals from those days, one now the
assistant editor of the Times of London, learned all phases of
newspapering, from pressroom to pub-crawling. His first big
interview was with the actress Margaret Lockwood.
   ``But something happened, I don't know what, and I joined the
Navy,'' he says. He served on a submarine, and later a corvette,
the latter the small, always-rolling ship about which Nicholas
Monsarrat wrote in ``The Cruel Sea.''
   ``My dream, when I was 17, was a big one,'' O'Toole says. ``I
couldn't make up my mind whether I was to be editor of Paris Match
or of Life.'' A sigh. His eyes twinkle. ``I finished up as a typist
on a corvette during the cod wars.''
   That isn't the usual preparation for the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Arts. But after leaving the service, he attended that
distinguished school, where he began learning his actor's craft,
Shakespeare and all that.
   In time, he also learned of the slings and arrows of outrageous
critics. How does he regard critics now? He smiles. ``I disregard
them. When you've been punching along in the game as long I have .
.. you find they go away and die.''
   Beside paying the rent and then some, acting has enabled him to
see the world and meet fascinating people. High on his list of
great characters is Huston, the late film director, whom he calls
``a magnanimous and good friend to me.''
   ``He struck wonderful poses, John,'' O'Toole says. He smiles at
the memory of a time he and the director emerged from a London
studio and found a young man lying on the street, a small crowd
gathered around him.
   Neither of them knew the man, who lay very still, not moving a
muscle.
   ``So John walked up to him'' _ O'Toole imitated the director
leaning over and examining the fallen with a seemingly professional
eye _ ``and pronounced, `Kurt'll be fine. Kurt'll be just fine.'
   ``Standing in the group was a man who said, `Sir, I'm a doctor.
And''' _ O'Toole's voice took on a dramatic edge, ```that young man
has been dead for 30 minutes.'''
   __
   Elsewhere in television ...
   YET ANOTHER REASON TO SAY `OH WOW': NBC on May 6 will show a TV
movie, ``Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again,'' based on the
long-running cartoon strip, ``Archie.'' The strip's teen-agers, who
include Betty, Veronica and Jughead, have yet to graduate from
either high school or innocence.
   But in the movie, a spokesman says, they will be
thirtysomething, facing such woes of the '90s as divorce, career
changes and single parenthood.

   An unexpected resurrection of nations from
totalitarianism has swept Eastern Europe in recent months,
reintroducing long-trampled freedoms and reducing international
distrust. The first story in a five-part Easter series,
``Resurrection of Nations,'' examines the surprising upheaval and
its religious threads.

   In a blink, the landscape heaved and the world changed. People
could hardly believe it. Amazed, incredulous, they saw a new
reality dawning over the earth, surmounting old fears and fatalism.
   The grim, immutable facts of their existence were suddenly not
what they had seemed.
   That baffled astonishment among Eastern Europeans at their burst
from bondage also resonates in the recorded reaction to the
resurrection of Christ and the liberating word of Easter.
   ``It has indeed been miraculous, a miracle that happened in the
souls of people,'' said the Rev. John Meyendorff, a scholar of the
Russian-derived but independent Orthodox Church in America. ``It
has been a resurrection from a long deadening of individual
creativity and the God-given dignity of being human for millions of
people.''
   No one could have predicted its suddenness and sweep, he said.
``I never thought I'd live to see it. People are finding it hard to
believe.''
   An ``idle tale,'' the apostles scoffed at first reports of
Christ's resurrection. It made no sense, the buried restored to
life? They couldn't conceive of it until it confronted them,
directly and plainly.
   Likewise, it had seemed impossible that half a continent could
so rapidly be raised from its deep abyss of totalitarian
repression. Yet in a swift, seismic wave of decisive events, the
whole posture of nations took another form.
   In a seeming instant, a new era of expanding rights and greater
international trust yawned wide.
   Symbolizing the far-reaching phenomenon, the Berlin Wall _ that
barrier of cold war that for three decades had divided humanity,
literally and figuratively _ at last came tumbling down Nov. 9.
   Among rejoicing throngs, an East German friar said with a
chuckle, ``The iron curtain is not so much iron anymore.''
   The wall's demise and the rest of the whirlwind that freed
nations and eased superpower antagonisms symbolically reflected a
Scripture passage on Christ's crucifixion and resurrection:
   ``For he is our peace, who has made us both one, and has broken
down the dividing wall of hostility.''
   The changes came in tidal profusion in the Soviet Union and its
satellite countries, one after another, like some pent-up force
breaking loose, uncontainable, overflowing, toppling tyrants,
unleashing multitudes from their chains.
   Almost magically, the changes came generally without violence,
in so-called ``soft'' or ``velvet'' revolutions.
   ``Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of
hosts,'' the biblical prophet Zechariah said.
   Just as Christ's resurrection defied logic, so on another plane
did the breakthrough of nations. The sweeping transformation of
1989 contradicted all prior analyses and predictions. It went
against the prognostications of the keenest thinkers and the
gloomiest doomsayers.
   ``It is difficult to think of any series of developments more
astonishing,'' said Roman Catholic historian-theologian Richard
McBrien.
   Harvard historian Richard Pipes wrote: ``The recent events there
have surpassed the wildest fantasies of any observer of Soviet
affairs who was willing to go on record.''
   The facts, those grim facts of life in the Soviet bloc, were
suddenly turned upside down. Just as Christ's followers rejoiced
when he rose from the dead, Eastern Europe's long coerced and
silenced millions lurched forth into the exhilarating, yet
bewilderingly unfamiliar light of new freedom.
   ``We are like children waking from a nightmare in the middle of
the night,'' Emilian Mercan, a member of the hastily formed
provisional government of Carisova, Romania, said after the
mid-December collapse of the harsh Ceausescu regime. ``All we want
is reassurance that it won't happen again.''
   Gradually, the countries of Eastern Europe are permitting such
gifts to the spirit as the freedoms to speak out, assemble,
organize and vote. But the daybreak atmosphere, like life itself,
is loaded with risk and uncertainty.
   ``It happened so quickly,'' said Petar Darliev, a Bulgarian
imprisoned for nine years who at 74 is helping plan the country's
first multiparty elections in 45 years, scheduled for June. ``The
hard part starts now.''
   It ``is a peculiar drama, which no Earthling could have
written,'' said previously imprisoned playwright Vaclav Havel,
chosen to be Czechoslovakia's president by a new parliament in
December. General elections are set for June 8.
   Of the times before the crucifixion, the apostle Paul wrote,
``We know that the whole world has been groaning in travail until
now.''
   For much of the 20th century, the globe has been groaning,
caught in a tightening nuclear stranglehold, with no apparent way
to escape.
   But the metamorphosis provided by Christ has come, in a
different order, for nations. Writing after Christ rose from the
tomb, Paul said, ``So then you are no longer strangers and
sojourners, but fellow citizens ... and members of the household of
God.''
   The pace and scope of the changes have left statesmen and
pundits groping for reasons, scrambling to adjust to the
transfigured scene. They came in such a mounting crescendo as to
seem almost sheer revelation.
   ``One sees evidence of divine providence in human events like
this,'' said church historian Robert T. Handy. ``Who could have
thought it would happen?''
   Handy, historian emeritus of New York's Union Theological
Seminary, said he was ``worried about a backlash. We're still
dealing with politics.'' But he cited church involvement in Eastern
Europe's reform movements in saying:
   ``The ferment for freedom has always been very strong in the
Jewish-Christian tradition. It boils up again and again, and has
throughout history. It can be put down, but it boils up again. .. .
   ``The hand of God can be seen in these developments,'' Handy
added. ``God does work in history.''
   So do people, what Scripture calls God's co-workers. Jesus, in
giving up his life for a greater one at Easter, said people would
have to endure oppression and pain, but a better time beckoned.
   ``You will be sorrowful,'' he said before his death at the hands
of an occupation military regime that dominated a subjugated
people. ``But your sorrow will turn into joy.''

   All at once, democratic processes have come
alive in the Soviet Union, its monolithic communist system starting
to crumble after 72 years of regimentation. That enormous change at
the core of communism, the Soviet Union, is the focus of the second
story in a five-part Easter series, ``Resurrection of Nations.''

   When Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Wyoming last fall, they
exchanged gifts. Baker gave cowboy boots to Shevardnadze, who
presented Baker with an enameled picture of Jesus teaching the
people.
   ``You see,'' Shevardnadze remarked, ``even we communists are
changing our world view.''
   Recalling the incident later, Baker surmised that some innate
``resurgence of faith'' may have been at the roots of the
revolutionary changes sweeping Eastern Europe.
   The lightning-like reformation that has flashed over the Soviet
colossus and its peripheries is ``so striking that it marks the
beginning of a new era of world affairs,'' President Bush said in
his state-of-the-union address.
   It is a kind of metaphor for Easter, a rebirth of worldly hopes,
a resurrection of regimented millions from capitivity.
   ``It has raised the spirits of oppressed people all over the
world, not only in Eastern Europe but in South Africa and
elsewhere,'' said the dean of U.S. Roman Catholic historians,
Monsignor John Tracy Ellis.
   The reanimation swelled in the Soviet heartland after racing
around its borders at the end of 1989. The Soviet parliament voted
Feb. 27 to surrender the Communist Party's constitutional monopoly
of power as society's ``guiding force,'' a step approved last month
by the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies.
   This was an historic turning point for Soviet communism, a
reversal of a constitutionally enshrined belief that only the party
controlled the nation.
   Abandoning that dogma, said Roman Szporiuk, Russian studies
director at the University of Michigan, had seemed as implausible
as a declaration from ``the pope in Rome that there is no God.''
   Measures also were adopted to create a Western-style presidency
and executive branch cabinet.
   The Congress of People's Deputies, a popularly elected body
established only a year ago, includes several church leaders and
many non-communists. It meets annually and elects the 542-member
standing parliament, the Supreme Soviet. The deputies elected
Gorbachev to a five-year term as president; in 1995, the office
becomes subject to national voting.
   Popular elections and other freedoms, including approval of
long-banned individual property rights and budding free enterprise,
have proliferated across that once totalitarian nation.
   Sergei A. Kovalev, who spent a decade in labor camps, said of
his March victory in the first round of voting for the Russian
republic's parliament that he could not previously have imagined
such change.
   An unseen ``mole of history'' has been digging, he said.
``People could not foresee this fast time frame. The most
optimistic of us only could hope for such changes across 100
years.''
   Communist repressions had weighed for nearly three quarters of
the 20th century on the Soviet Union. For its satellite nations,
the Nazi occupation that began in 1938-39 gave way to Soviet
domination after World War II.
   Tens of thousands of Soviet citizens were tortured, herded into
slave labor camps or executed under the ruthless 24-year rule of
Joseph Stalin. He established an absolutist police state that
controlled every aspect of society. The despotism continued with
varying degrees of severity through Stalin's successors. The party
was a tiny minority of 19 million in a population of 287 million,
but its bureaucrats, KGB agents and informers restricted religion;
muzzled speech, print and broadcasts; forbade ownership or
assemblies; jailed dissenters, and promoted atheism as the state
religion, an official belief of disbelief.
   In March 1985, a different kind of communist _ Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, charismatic and tactically nimble _ took over the party.
The rigid communist autocracy began loosening its grip.
   ``We need spiritual values, we need a revolution of the mind,''
Gorbachev said on the eve of his unprecedented meeting with Pope
John Paul II last Dec. 1, at which the Soviet leader agreed to end
45 years of suppressing Ukrainian Catholicism. ``We have changed
our attitude about some matters such as religion.''
   Gorbachev himself was baptized in infancy and reared in Russian
Orthodoxy by a devout mother.
   ``Now we not only proceed from the assumption that no one should
interfere in matters of individual conscience,'' he said. ``We also
say that the moral values that religion generated and embodied for
centuries can help in the work of renewal in our country.''
   All around Gorbachev, strains of liberty burst forth. In his
homeland, political prisoners went free, debate flew wide open,
diversity bloomed, the superstructure loosened and private
initiative took toddling steps.
   People emigrated more freely _ 71,196 Jews left the Soviet Union
in 1989, the most ever, and 100,000 are expected to do so in 1990 _
while regular religious programming began for the first time on
radio and television.
   This ``is the day of resurrection for our church,'' Bishop
Innocent Lotocky of Chicago's Ukrainian-rite Catholics said of the
lifted ban on the church in the Ukraine. ``Our church was crucified
by the communists and sealed in the tomb,'' but now it lives again.
   Russian Orthodoxy reported the number of its active churches
increased by almost 3,000 in 1989 to a total of 9,734. Seminaries
and enrollments multiplied fourfold.
   Similar expansion occurred among Protestant churches. Baptists
received permission to open their first seminary. Churches began
the previously forbidden religious instruction of children.
   Soviet policy has shifted in 18 months ``from tolerance to
active promotion'' of churches, said Philip Oke of the
interdenominational Christian Peace Conference and a frequent
visitor to Eastern Europe.
   Bibles and other religious literature poured into the Soviet
Union. Bible societies formed, and the Academy of Science approved
a research project on personal values, using the Ten Commandments.
   The Society for Scientific Atheism changed its name to the
Society of Religion and Atheism. A Baptist choir performed at a
government cultural center, and a U.S-produced evangelistic movie,
``Jesus,'' dubbed into Russian, drew big audiences.
   The striking changes were presaged at the 1988 celebration of
Christianity's thousandth anniversary in Russia. Fervent crowds,
the presence of 500 church leaders from around the world and the
participation of Soviet officials, as well as Gorbachev's wife,
Raisa, left a lingering influence.
   ``You are entering a new period of history for the nation,''
American evangelist Billy Graham said then.
   Since then, one after another, old communist orders have fallen
_ gradually in Poland and Hungry, swiftly in East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Romania.
   Impulses of independence have flared in some of the 15 Soviet
republics, chiefly the Baltic states led by mostly Catholic
Lithuania.
   God's Spirit, Jesus said, is like the wind which ``blows where
it wills.''

   In rapid succession, Eastern Europe's
communism-shackled countries last year shook off their chains. The
third story in a five-part Easter series, ``Resurrection of
Nations,'' concentrates on the breakaway of East Germany, preceded
by renewals in Poland and Hungary.

   Against formidable odds, the people prayed and marched. Week
after week, they kept at it, coolheaded and persevering. Against
dangers and initial reprisals, church throngs repeatedly poured
into the night streets of East German cities, flickering candles
aloft.
   And they won.
   In a steel-handed communist state, ruled for 40 years by a
despotic regime and its dreaded secret police, the ``Stasi,'' the
churches harbored a peaceable but unflinching dynamism that
overthrew a seemingly immutable system.
   ``Everything is new! Everything is new!'' a young Baptist
minister, Siegfried Rosenmann, rejoiced in East Berlin after the
regime collapsed.
   The ``candlelight revolution'' was one of the strangest of all
in a year of utterly strange revolutions that unleashed winds of
democratic rights across Eastern Europe.
   ``A miraculous experience,'' Lutheran theologian Jurgen Ziemer
of Leipzig said of those tenacious confrontations at which riot
squads and plainclothes secret police abruptly stopped interfering
and simply stood by. ``We do not know what held them back.''
   Contrary to engrained practice, the enforcers just didn't act,
perhaps something like the benumbed Roman guards at Jesus' tomb. In
a differing sense, East Germans and others emerged from smothering
confinement into open air.
   Crushed human liberties are now ``alive again,'' said the Rev.
Leonid Kishkovsky, president of the U.S. National Council of
Churches, who recently visited East Germany and other Soviet bloc
countries.
   ``I see a miracle rooted in the way of the Cross that has been
lived by these people for decades,'' Kishkovsky said. ``Despite
suppression and great difficulties, the church has stood for
another vision of the world in contradiction to totalitarianism.''
   That vision insists that no worldly authority may violate
God-bestowed rights of individuality and conscience. The theme
reverberates through the Bible, epitomized in Moses' demand of
Pharaoh, ``Let my people go!''
   The demonstrations were nurtured by East German churches, where
discussions on peacemaking, justice and environmental concerns had
gone on for years. Last Oct. 9 at St. Nicolas Church in Leipzig,
Monday night services flowed outside, drawing a crowd of 100,000.
   Despite arrests and police beatings, the weekly services grew,
attracting non-believers as well; the Nov. 6 demonstration drew
480,000. By then, demonstrations had spread to churches in Dresden,
East Berlin, Schwerin, Halle and Wittenberg. Word had circulated:
``On Monday night, something is happening at the churches.''
   In the land where 15th century reformer Martin Luther fired his
protest against Rome's ecclesiastical domination, the churches
became havens, rallying places and an umbrella for political as
well as religious voices of reform.
   ``No other social force in the country had independence from the
state and party'' and could thus supply space for dialogue and
inspiration, said pastor Werner Widrat of Lutheran Gethsemane
Church in East Berlin.
   Bolstering their peaceful tactics, the pre-demonstration
services often included Scripture readings from the Beatitudes:
``Blessed are the peacemakers. ... Blessed are those who are
presecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven.''
   The churches had adopted the non-violent tactics of Martin
Luther King Jr. and Mohandas Gandhi. Typical of church messages
issued in the crisis was this from Thuringia's Lutheran Bishop
Werner Leich:
   ``I beg you ... no matter what happens, do not deviate from the
principle of non-violence. ... Do not let yourselves be intimidated
any longer. ... No renewal in the truth can come about unless we
are willing to be bold and make sacrifices. ... God has given us
the spirit of strength. ... Our present way will not be easy. But
we shall succeed. ... Let us stand together.''
   Crowds in Bitterfeld and elsewhere sang the American civil
rights anthem, ``We Shall Overcome.''
   Communist ruler Erick Honecker, whose iron-fisted rule lasted 18
years, was deposed Oct. 18. The Berlin Wall was opened Nov. 9. On
Jan. 14, church mediators stopped the storming of East Berlin's
secret police headquarters.
   Church leaders were credited for a pivotal role in the whole
affair by world leaders, including Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   In ensuing sessions of the caretaker government, New Forum,
church figures led the transition prior to last month's elections.
   East Berlin Lutheran pastor Rainer Epplemann, an early leader in
church opposition to the regime, served as minister without
portfolio in the interim government. He also headed the Democratic
Reawakening Party, allied with the March 18 winning coalition
favoring reunion with West Germany.
   At the same time, Lutheran pastor Christian Fuehrer of Leipzig's
St. Nicholas Church warned against resurgent nationalism and
obsession with Western riches, saying:
   ``The Coca-Cola culture is taking over and people are rushing
blindly to change one set of chains for another.''
   And in a gesture of basic Christian compassion, Lutheran Bishop
Gottfried Forck of Berlin-Brandenburg temporarily sheltered the
fallen Honecker. He and his wife, Margot, were declared
``homeless'' after a court ruled that the 77-year-old dictator's
illness prevented jailing him on charges of high treason.
   Forck arranged for them to stay in two spare rooms at the home
of Lutheran pastor Uwe Homer, noting that the shelter was offered
in the spirit of Christian mercy to sinners.
   The broad turn to democracy started earlier and proceeded more
gradually in Poland and Hungary.
   In Poland, visited three times by the pope, stubborn strikes and
demonstrations in 1980 gave birth to the Solidarity labor union,
the first in Eastern Europe. The union, backed by the church, was
outlawed in 1982 under martial law.
   Its leader, Lech Walesa, was arrested and other union leaders
were driven underground, but the union maintained pressure on the
government. The pressure, coupled with a disastrous economy, forced
negotiations last year that led to the June 4 elections when
Solidarity swept into control of parliament.
   In May 1988, Hungary ousted its puppet party boss, Janos Kadar,
who had ruled for 32 years, ever since Soviet tanks crushed a
Hungarian uprising in 1956.
   A national catharsis came June 16, 1989, when bodies of executed
leaders of the revolt, including that of Prime Minister Imre Nagy,
were exhumed from unmarked graves and reburied with honors.
   In January 1989, Hungary cut the electrified barbed wire along
its border with Austria, opening it to vacationing East Germans and
others fleeing communist oppression.
   All Soviet troops are to be withdrawn from Hungary by June 30,
1991, and last month's multiparty elections were seen as the advent
of working democracy.
   God ``gives power to the faint,'' wrote the biblical prophet
Isaiah. They ``shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with
wings like eagles.''

   The rout of communism spread swiftly but
peaceably to Czechoslovakia. The fourth story in a five-part Easter
series, ``Resurrection of Nations,'' concerns the Czech surge to
freedom and the rise of a `Wenceslas' heritage, as well as
Bulgaria's repudiation of communism.

<TEXT>
   He was a beloved king, Wenceslas, sainted and celebrated in song
and story, elevated to Czechoslovakia's throne in 922 in a popular
uprising against an anti-religious tyrant who had seized power by
force and murder.
   A statue of the good king presides over Prague's historic
gathering place, Wenceslas Square, where 10 days of huge protest
marches culminated Nov. l7 in the overthrow of another dictatorship
and the choice of another leader named Wenceslas.
   That is the Latinized form of the Czech name ``Vaclav,'' which
is the first name of Vaclav Havel, the repeatedly imprisoned
playwright and straight-talking dissenter against authoritarianism,
now the country's president.
   Plainly surprised, even awestruck at the spontaneous rise of the
populace against 40 years of Soviet-armed communist rule, Havel
called it one of those strangely true contradictions, ``the power
of the powerless.''
   This is the sort of paradox manifested in the Easter events, the
crucifixion of Jesus, his disciples scattered, in hiding, but then
his resurrection in glory.
   ``He was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God,''
Scripture says.
   On a temporal level, the sweeping overturn of communism across
Eastern Europe has brought another kind of rebirth, also astounding.
   ``It's a spiritual resurrection,'' said Olga Hruby, Czech-born
editor of the U.S. documentary journal, Religion in Communist
Dominated Areas. ``Freedom had been buried for a long time. Now
it's alive.
   ``People ... underwent terrible agonies and suffering. Now they
have been restored to citizenship and given back their spiritual
freedom. They've been resurrected.''
   In cobblestoned Wenceslas Square, a half-mile long and 200 feet
wide in the ``golden city'' of medieval towers and baroque domes,
Havel's Dec. 29 elevation to the presidency was greeted by
firecracker salutes, streamers and an embracing, singing throng.
   ``Your government, my people, has been returned to you,'' he
said in his first televised address to the nation Jan. l,
paraphrasing a 17th century Moravian religious reformer, John Amios
Comenius.
   ``Everywhere in the world, people were surprised at how these
malleable, humiliated, cynical citizens of Czechoslovakia ... found
the tremendous strength to cast off a totalitarian system in an
entirely peaceful and dignified manner within a few weeks,'' Havel
said.
   ``We ourselves were surprised at it.''
   Proclaiming amnesty for political prisoners and those convicted
of non-violent crimes, he urged people ``to help them in a
Christian spirit ... to find in themselves what our prisons could
not instill: repentance and a desire to lead a good life.''
   Havel, 53, who served five years in prison for criticizing
repressive rule, ascribed the new freedom to the suffering of
others who had struggled courageously in the Soviet Union, East
Germany, Hungary, Poland and elsewhere.
   Referring to the years of persecutions, with many dying in
prisons, many executed and thousands of lives destroyed, he said,
``It was these great sacrifices which wove ... the backdrop of our
newly charged freedom.
   ``All human suffering concerns each human being'' he said.
   This is a biblical principle, that humanity is interlinked and
that abuse of anyone, anywhere, imperils everyone, everywhere.
   Christianity holds that those who share the cross of Christ, in
bearing their own cross for others, share ultimately in his triumph
of resurrection.
   ``Upon him was the chastisement that made us whole,'' Scripture
says.
   Czechoslovakia's aging, once imprisoned Catholic Bishop Fratisek
Tomacek helped lay the groundwork for upheaval in 1985, gathering
600,000 signatures on petitions demanding religious freedom.
   When the November demonstrations prompted beatings and arrests,
Tomacek risked new arrest by recalling the previously ignored plea
and commending ``this huge protest against injustices committed
against us for decades.''
   All around, he said, countries ``have broken out of the prison
of totalitarian systems. We must not wait any longer. It is
necessary to act.''
   Such encouragement helped push crowds in Wenceslas Square to a
half million despite 20-degree weather. ``For the first time we
aren't scared anymore,'' exclaimed Martin Jestrik, a cinema student
and demonstration organizer.
   The undaunted marchers forced out the communist autocrat, Milos
Jakes, and the entire party resigned Dec. 3. It was replaced by a
provisional non-communist coalition, Civic Forum, whose initial
moderator and chief spokesman was he once imprisoned Catholic
priest Vaclav Maly.
   In the Prague demonstrations, he leaped to the platform and led
demonstrators in the Lord's prayer.
   Freely competing political parties were authorized and a new
cabinet was installed Dec. l0, involving several prominent
Christians. Among them were Jan Carnogursky, a Catholic lawyer
freed from prison in November, as deputy premier and Czech Brethren
theologian Josef Hromodka as vice president.
   Havel, seen making the sign of the cross at worship services in
St. Vitus Cathedral celebrating the downfall of communist rule,
told an interviewer:
   ``I have observed that our revolution, thanks to its heavenly
director, has several elements of classical drama and theater of
the absurd.''
   In customary black denims and sweater at his rather disarrayed
third-floor offices in Hardcany castle, he grinned, puzzling over
his ``curious passage from jail to the castle.''
   With mail piled on the floor and young assistants bustling
about, he occasionally called time out. ``Let's all laugh for a
minute.''
   A papal visit to Czechoslovakia is scheduled April 21-22, and
multiparty elections are set for June 8. Havel got the Soviets to
agree to remove their troops by July 31, 1991.
   Concurrent with Czechoslovakia's renewal, presistent
demonstrations in Bulgaria, initially crushed, forced out the
communist ruler of 35 years, Todor Shivkov, on Nov. 10. He is in
prison charged with murder and other crimes.
   Subsequent demonstrations in December demanded greater
democracy. A score of opposition groups hopes to end communist
control in June elections, the first in 45 years.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, visiting the
Bulgarian capital of Sofia on Feb. 10, told a cheering crowd, ``You
are the people who have brought Bulgaria to a new age of
democracy.''
   Havel, addressing Congress in Washington on Feb. 21, observed,
``It is all very extraordinary.'' He added:
   ``The only genuine backbone for all our actions, if they are to
be moral, is responsibility _ responsibility to something higher
than my family, my country, my firm, my success.''
   If ``this voice'' of conscience is put ahead of politics,
economics or whatever, he said, the new leadership ``can't go far
wrong.''
   A sign seen in Prague ticks off a timetable of the accelerating
democratic upsurges: ``Poland l0 years, Hungary l0 months, East
Germany l0 weeks, Czechoslovakia, 10 days, Romania, 10 hours.''
   ``The bows of the mighty are broken,'' records the prophet
Samuel, ``but the feeble gird on strength.''

   In Opera Square in Timisoara, Romania, people these afternoons
place lighted candles before wreaths and wooden portraits of Jesus,
then kneel to pray _ in sorrow for those who died there, in hope
for the future of their nation.
   That country, where Nicolae Ceausescu had vowed communism would
never budge, not ``until pears grow on poplar trees,'' broke free
in one spontaneous instant, when the despot was jeered in public,
forced to flee and, four days later, executed by a firing squad.
   The upheaval, which began with a lone pastor in Timisoara, was
both tame in origins yet wild, unplanned and headlong, murderously
repulsed yet successful, fervently keen yet stained with vindictive
passion, a maelstrom producing a democracy.
   The events were ``surprising, fantastic and dreadful,'' all at
the same time, the Rev. Wolfgang Hermann Rehner, a Romanian
Lutheran pastor, told a clergy meeting.
   It was the resurrection of a trampled, prostrate people, an
Easter-hued rising from despair.
   The Romanian Orthodox Church, after its collaborationist leaders
had resigned, said in a message to the world's Christians:
   ``After decades of slavery under the Communist dictatorship and
after immense suffering ... God has turned his eyes toward our
people. ... He has raised us from the shadow of death and set us
free.''
   Romania's rocky stampede to liberty began in mid-December in
Timisoara, where the soft-spoken but courageous Rev. Laszlo Tokes,
37, had been threatened, his church and home raided, for
criticizing the regime. He sent his pregnant wife and young son to
live with relatives.
   On Dec. 15, Tokes was served with a court-ordered eviction
notice, backed up by his subservient Protestant Reformed bishop. To
keep their pastor, his congregation ringed the church.
   By dusk of the next day, the crowd had grown to 5,000. By then
they were surrounded by the detested security police, the
Securitate, armed with automatic weapons and small tanks.
   ``We want liberty! Down with Ceausescu!'' the crowd chanted. The
Securitate responded with bullets, and the first victims fell.
   But the crowds returned the next day. They numbered 50,000 in
the city center Dec. 17. Most of the killing in Timisoara occurred
that day amid repeated bursts of gunfire and tear gas. Screams and
falling bodies punctuated the chaos.
   Demonstrations quickly flared in other cities and met similar
reprisals. In Timisoara, slayings continued Dec. 18. Thirty
youngsters were reportedly mowed down as they stood with candles on
the cathedral steps.
   Figures revised from much higher early estimates indicate about
100 died in Timisoara and more than 300 were wounded.
   Officers of the regular army, a second-class outfit given low
pay and shoddy equipment, refused to join the elite Securitate in
the slaughter.
   As demonstrations spread to Arad, Sibiu and other towns,
including the capital of Bucharest, the Securitate kept up the
killing, firing from buildings, running cars and from atop armored
personnel carriers, raising the toll to 746 dead.
   ``The solidarity demonstration for me changed into a general
protest against the regime,'' Tokes said later.
   On Dec. 21, Ceausescu staged a rally outside party headquarters,
the ornate former palace of the Romanian monarch. Workers and party
functionaries were herded into Palace Square with placards hailing
Ceausescu.
   In a raspy voice, the 71-year-old dictator railed against
``foreign enemies'' and ``terrorist subversives.'' Suddenly from
far back, boos sounded. Like a wave, boos and jeers rolled up to
the balcony.
   Ceausescu froze, and fear crossed his face just before he
ordered the television cameras cut off. When the army refused to
shoot, he and his despised wife, Elena, fled, first in a
helicopter, then in a red car.
   Captured Dec. 22 in a grain silo, the Ceausescus were given a
two-hour trial and shot on Christmas Day.
   Tokes, kept on the run all that tumultuous week, became a member
of the unity council of the provisional government, the National
Salvation Front. It outlawed the feared Securitate and set
multi-party elections for May 20.
   Among celebrating crowds, a continual chant memorialized the
events and the city that started it all: ``Timisoara! Timisoara!''
For the first time in decades, full Romanian Orthodox liturgies
appeared on television, along with special services for those who
died.
   Tokes later was named bishop, replacing the collaborating
prelate who had sought his ouster.
   But the falls of Ceausescu brought new chaos and failed to
banish old anxieties. Romanians have no experience with democracy,
and the Front is constantly challenged and second-guessed.
Hardships and scarcities remain, scars of past horrors and
suspicions in a country long thick with informers and ``mincuini,''
the lies that characterized the past regime.
   Arduous reconstruction lies ahead in the liberated countries,
including the latest one, Mongolia. In that land of herdsmen
between the Soviet and China, the Communist Party on March 14
surrendered its constitutional monopoly and prepared for multiparty
elections later this year.
   Besides the dismemberment of communism, liberating currents also
stirred in Latin America and South Africa.
   In Nicaragua, voters on Feb. 26 ousted Marxist-leaning Daniel
Ortega. The new president, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, assumes
office April 25.
   In Haiti, former Supreme Court Justice Ertha Pascal Trouillot
last month became the first civilian president since dictator
Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier was toppled in 1986, ending 29
years of Duvalier dictatorship.
   In Chile, Patricio Aylwin's election victory Dec. 14 made him
the first civilian president since 1973. The 17-year rule of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet had been marked by torture, political killings and
disappearances.
   In Brazil, the first popularly elected president in 29 years,
Fernando Collor de Mello, assumed office March 15.
   In Namibia, independence was achieved March 21 after 75 years of
military rule by bordering South Africa.
   In South Africa, President F.W. de Klerk in February lifted a
30-year ban on the African National Congress, which has fought
minority white rule, and released its leader Nelson Mandela from
27{ years in prison.
   ``Hallelujah! Hallelujah!'' cried South Africa's Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who did a little dance. ``Freedom is
coming!''
   ``There's no single explanation'' for it all, said Monsignor
John Tracy Ellis, a noted U.S. Catholic historian. ``It's a
univeral phenomenon of the human spirit that longs to be free.
   ``Freedom is in the air and please God that it will sweep the
whole planet and embrace the poor people of Cambodia and China and
North Korea.''
   In the daybreak of change many horizons remain clouded, but glow
with promise.
   ``You will know the truth,'' Jesus said of his crucifixion and
resurrection. ``And the truth will make you free.''

<HEAD>Racial Violence Results From Influx of Immigrants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FLORENCE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>

   Carlo Testi remembers when the problem of
illegal immigration came to his door, right on the Via de'
Calzaioli, one of the most fashionable streets in this Renaissance
city.
   A few African immigrants spread blankets on the pedestrian mall,
putting out sunglasses and fake Louis Vuitton bags for sale. Others
came, and soon there were 400 vendors.
   ``People couldn't pass any more,'' Testi said, gazing down the
street from his family's century-old hat shop to the Ponte Vecchio,
a 14th century bridge. ``It was a desperate situation.''
   These days, not an African vendor is in sight. City hall sent
hundreds of police to round up illegal immigrants and vendors.
Newspapers called it a ``witchhunt for blacks.''
   The police sweep, which followed a bloody attack by youths on
African immigrants, raised an outcry and made Florence, the
birthplace of Renaissance humanism, the symbol of a national debate
on immigration and racism.
   ``Italy has given the world 26 million emigrants,'' Deputy
Premier Claudio Martelli said. ``Is it possible that the fifth or
sixth industrial power loses its bearings, is torn apart or reacts
with furor and malice before the difficulties and problems raised
by a few hundred thousand immigrants?''
   Violence against immigrants has been a problem in central and
northern European countries as they have absorbed citizens of
former colonies and workers from poorer countries. France
experienced a wave of racist attacks on North Africans in recent
weeks.
   Florence's immigrants are poor Africans and Latin Americans
attracted to countries in southern Europe that have enjoyed
economic booms but still lack the immigration controls imposed in
recent years by France, Britain and Scandinavia.
   Experts say Italy, with about 100,000 illegal immigrants
arriving each year, has become the focal point of the new
migration. It has difficulty absorbing them, despite a strong
economy, because of scarce housing and poor public health and
education systems.
   This ethnically homogeneous country has seen ugly racial attacks
in recent years that many Italians had thought occurred only in the
United States, or at least outside Italy.
   The government now hopes to stem the immigration with an
amnesty, its second in four years.
   Immigration in the past year ``has been huge and unforeseen,''
said Giorgio Morales, a Socialist who was forced to resign as mayor
of Florence after the police sweep.
   ``These new phenomena have come in a short time in Florence, and
because of this there has been a reaction of intolerance,'' he said.
   Estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in Italy range
from 500,000 to 1.5 million.
   Ugo Vittorio Saibante of the government's National Council of
the Economy and Work, said he believed the number was about 1
million, up 100 percent from 1985, and that only about half had
work permits.
   Authorities say many illegal immigrants take jobs Italians no
longer want, particularly in the countryside, where they pick
tomatoes, help fishermen or work in small factories.
   Saibante, however, spoke of ``a tendency among people from less
developed countries to go to the cities,'' where ``there are many
fewer possibilities. Here is where the problems of racism begin.''
   Trouble developed in Florence about a year ago, as African
vendors filled the streets around the pink-and-green Duomo
cathedral and the 14th century city hall, the Palazzo Vecchio,
which attract thousands of tourists daily.
   Police ignored the newcomers at first, but strictly regulated
souvenir and handicraft vendors were furious. Shopkeepers also
complained.
   ``To see all these people here in the center wasn't good for
tourism,'' Testi said. ``The image was ugly.''
   African vendors say they merely wanted to earn a living while
looking for steady work, and accuse the shopkeepers of racism.
   ``We must sell to pay the hotel,'' said a 26-year-old Senegalese
who shares a cheap room with another vendor. ``Otherwise we have to
sleep on the street.''
   In February, about 4,000 residents held a ``March of Defenseless
Citizens'' against a crime wave many people attributed to
immigrants working for Italian-run drug and prostitution rings.
   Days later, dozens of masked young ``avengers'' armed with
baseball bats and iron bars went on a rampage during pre-Lent
Carnival celebrations, beating up African immigrants.
   In mid-March, spurred by citizen complaints, authorities ordered
the large-scale police operation to pick up illegal immigrants and
chase African vendors away. The vendors responded with a hunger and
sit-down strike.
   The assault by youths and massive police action shocked
Italians, who are proud of their tolerance and have a long emigrant
tradition. Other racist attacks have taken place in major cities.
   ``People also yelled crook, swindler, invader at my father in
Boston,'' Monsignor Luigi Di Liego, Rome director of the charity
organization Caritas, said in an interview in the newspaper La
Repubblica.
   Officials hope to ease tensions with a new amnesty law sponsored
by Deputy Premier Martelli, a Socialist.
   It would allow foreigners who arrived before Dec. 31 to get work
permits and benefits. Unlike an unsuccessful 1987 amnesty, the new
law imposes heavy penalties on employers who do not legalize their
workers, and establishes strict rules about who can enter the
country.
   Critics predict it will not slow the flood of immigrants, who
often come by sea and do not pass through border controls.
   ``With the amnesty ... Italy has sent a message: Whoever enters
this country not only will never be thrown out, but sooner or later
will be regularized,'' said Giorgio La Malfa, head of the
Republican Party, part of the governing coalition. His party
opposed the amnesty measure in Parliament.

<HEAD>Civil War Interest Thrives, 125 Years After Appomattox</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's troops chased
the Confederate government from Richmond, a slave named James
Wilder hid in a tobacco silo.
   ``He almost suffocated in that silo,'' recalls the slave's
grandson, Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, recounting the story
passed down through his father.
   Instead, James Wilder emerged to find himself suddenly a free
man, and the city, which had been bombarded for months, wrapped in
flames.
   Grant rode on 95 miles to Appomattox, where Gen. Robert E. Lee
surrendered the South's main army seven days later on April 9,
1865, and Wilder went on to beget the father of the nation's first
black elected governor.
   Though 125 years have passed since the end of the Civil War, it
still is ingrained in the consciences of many Southern natives.
   Stories about the war are reaching more people than ever through
a growing number of battle re-enactments, battlefield tours, books
and specialty magazines, and through the celebrated movie
``Glory,'' about the Union's first black regiment.
   ``There are so many events being re-enacted that we can't keep
track of them,'' said David Roth, editor of Blue and Gray, a
magazine with the motto ``For Those Who Still Hear The Guns.''
   The regional and racial divisions exacerbated by the ``War of
Northern Aggression,'' the term still used by some southerners, are
beginning to close, and the symbols of the Old South are becoming
more anachronistic.
   Trucks with Confederate flags on the rear windows and bumper
stickers reading ``Forget, Hell!'' and ``The South Will Rise
Again'' are becoming endangered species, but the ironies of the
South in transition still pervade Richmond, the capital of the
Confederacy.
   Residents celebrate the birthdays of Lee, Gen. Stonewall Jackson
and Martin Luther King Jr. on the same day.
   Mary Sue Terry, the state's first female attorney general, is
fighting a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit seeking to force
Virginia Military Institute to admit women. VMI cadets fought to
secede from the federal government, and many of the southern
generals were graduates.
   One of only two buildings in Richmond's commercial district that
survived Grant's 10-month siege is a granite structure that housed
offices of the Confederate government. Occupying the building now
is the federal court, the institution that helped rid the South of
segregation.
   Across the Martin Luther King Bridge and a block to the left are
the Museum of the Confederacy and the Confederate White House, now
surrounded by high-rise university buildings.
   The museum's sign-in sheet is replete with the names of visitors
from cities to the north, as well as Canada and Europe.
   Attendance never has been better, spokeswoman Barbara Hyde said.
   ``There always has been a high interest in the Civil War, but in
the past four years, it has increased tremendously,'' she said.
   On Richmond's Monument Avenue, two black women and a white man
who attend a karate class nearby practice their moves at the base
of a towering statue of Lee on horseback.
   In between kick punches, Carrie Britton relates how she cried
when she saw the movie ``Glory'' and only then learned there were
black soldiers who died fighting for the Union. ``There was a white
woman who made a point of holding the door for me when I was
leaving the theater,'' Ms. Britton said. ``She was touched, too.''
   The provocation for the Civil War was at first largely the
labor-intensive South's objection to tariffs favored by the
industrialized North, although the issue of slavery bitterly
divided the regions. Only later did the focus shift to the
constitutional issues of secession and the abolition of slavery.
   Those issues led to the poignant human drama of brother fighting
brother, father fighting son and friend fighting friend,
particularly in border states.
   The cost of the war was tremendous. More than 600,000 Union and
Confederate soldiers died over the four-year period, nearly
equaling the number of Americans killed in all other wars combined.
   Because of the high number of casualties, almost everyone who
had forebears in America in 1861 can associate with the war, said
Ed Bearss, chief historian of the National Park Service.
   Charles Bryan, director of the Virginia Historical Society, said
he and other Civil War scholars on the lecture circuit are being
asked to explain why people continue to be fascinated by the
struggle 125 years later.
   To answer, he pulls a cone-shaped rifle bullet from his pocket,
a Minie ball recovered at a battlefield outside Richmond that's now
a residential development.
   ``A young boy brought it to the Historical Society,'' Bryan
said. ``One of the reasons the war is so fascinating is that it
happened in our own backyard, both literally and figuratively.''
   The war destroyed the economic and social system of the South.
The 12 years of Reconstruction that followed, a period in which the
11 secessionist states were regarded as conquered territories,
solidified the region's antagonism toward the North.
   ``I don't think there would have been a solid South had there
not been what southerners saw as a harsh Reconstruction,'' Bearss
said.
   ``The feelings were so visceral that it went past just
disagreement on political ideologues,'' Wilder said. ``Rather, it
was almost a lifestyle to be different. The only thing that can
change that is the passage of time.''
   An increasingly mobile society and the commonality of mass
communications also are softening the divisions, Bryan said.
   ``Little by little, the separate identities of the North and
South are beginning to change,'' he said.
   Bryan said the lingering prejudices became apparent to him when
the topic of a speech he gave on the commemoration of Lee's
birthday _ the 18 native Virginians who served as generals in the
Union army _ was publicized in advance.
   ``I got angry phone calls from people who said, `How dare you
talk about Yankee generals on General Lee's birthday?' '' he said.
``The Civil War still lives in the minds of many people. It will
never be forgotten.''

   ``Welcome To Historic Appomattox, Where
Our Nation Reunited.''
   Other than the wooden sign at the side of the highway, Harry
Lillie's Civil War souvenir and relic shop adjoining the Lee-Grant
Motel is the only reminder of what happened two miles outside town
on April 9, 1865.
   In the Victorian parlor of a private home, with the
Confederacy's main army surrounded and starving, Gen. Robert E. Lee
surrendered to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, ending, for all intents and
purposes, the War Between the States.
   On the muddy main road of the tiny village of Appomattox Court
House three days later, exactly four years after the war started at
Fort Sumter, S.C., Confederate Gen. John Gordon marched his 28,231
ragged, emaciated troops one last time.
   As Union troops from the 100,000-strong Army of the Potomac
lined the muddy road, the Rebels stacked their guns, hung their
ammunition pouches on the sights, furled their Confederate battle
flags and began the long trek home.
   In a re-enactment commemorating the 125th anniversary Sunday,
the solemn sound of soldiers marching again will be broken by the
crisp order ``Stack ... arms.'' But the skirmishes will be
re-enacted 150 miles away in Fredericksburg.
   Neither local residents nor the National Park Service, which
operates the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park,
wanted to restage the battles.
   Lillie, a well-meaning carpetbagger from New Jersey, is
perplexed by what he considers residents' apathy about the role
their county played in American history.
   ``Appomattox was big enough to handle the actual battles and
surrender, but is not big enough to handle the re-enacted battles.
That ought to tell you something,'' he said.
   About 110,000 people visit Appomattox Court House annually, but
few tarry because Appomattox has only two small hotels and few
places to eat, said Jon Montgomery, the park superintendent.
   In 1865, there were 8,900 residents. Now there are about 12,800.
A publicity pamphlet issued by the chamber of commerce describes
Appomattox as ``an old-fashioned town where progress is slow and
measured.''
   But a chain hotel now is under construction across the street
from Lillie's, and a shopping center, Historic Junction, recently
was completed. Fast-food restaurants beckon on the main highway,
and there are plans to lure more people into the main part of town,
with its freshly painted, century-old wooden homes and stores.
   Montgomery and Mayor Ronnie Spiggle said it takes a sense of
history to understand the reluctance over the years to
commercialize the park and the decision this year to ignore the
battles that took place 125 years ago.
   Spiggle agrees with the shrine-like treatment of the park, which
continues to be surrounded by miles of undeveloped pastures and
looks nearly identical to what the soldiers saw in 1865.
   ``We don't want to emphasize the battles. They were
insignificant compared to other battles of the war,'' Montgomery
said. ``The story here is the peace that came here.''
   After the war, Southern opposition to a park at Appomattox kept
the federal government from establishing one for 75 years. A new
highway skirted the deteriorating village. Buildings disintegrated
and burned. Some were torn down.
   In 1940, the National Park Service acquired the land for the
park, and the main buildings of the village eventually were
restored or reconstructed in time for the 100th anniversary of the
surrender.
   The 10 historic structures, most red brick surround by
split-rail or white picket fences, include the McLean House, where
the terms of surrender were signed, the courthouse, a tavern, a
jail, a general store, a tiny law office and several residences.
   ``The southerners wanted to forget what happened here,''
Montgomery said. ``It marked the end of their hopes of having a
separate country.''

   Graham Marshall in his middle years appears to have an enviable
life: important post at a Manhattan ad agency, wife and home in the
suburbs.
   But on closer examination we see that his job is threatened by a
younger, ruthless executive, his wife is a nagging shrew and he is
drowning in debt.
   Then one day in the subway, a tragedy makes Graham realize that
crimes can go undetected. He cooly plans complicated schemes to rid
himself of his enemies. His plot is triggered when he loses a
much-needed promotion to the young conniver, causing his wife's
comment, ``I forgive you for your failure.''
   ``A Shock to the System'' (a word-play on Graham's mode of
execution) might have been minor-league Hitchcock. But the movie
bears watching, if only to observe a master performer at work.
   Michael Caine is Graham Marshall, and it is a pleasure to see a
real pro make more of a script than what is on the pages. Caine's
bland face reflects all the maddening frustrations that drive him
toward his devilish deeds. When he rages against the yuppie who
usurped his job, Caine is Olympian in his wrath. When he cooly
executes his remote-control murders, he is as menacing as Freddy
Kreuger.
   ``A Shock to the System'' marks a promising entry into feature
films for Jan Egleson, who has directed prestige films for public
television. He skillfully plays the murderous events against the
normality of New York high rises and peaceful suburbia.
   Andrew Klavan wrote the script, adapting Simon Brett's novel.
The plot is cleverly devised, but it's hard to believe that Caine's
acts would not attract more police suspicion. His only pursuer is a
suburban detective (Will Patton) who seems slow to round up a case.
   The film is well cast. Elizabeth McGovern is convincingly
vulnerable as the co-worker who becomes Caine's lover and potential
victim. Peter Riegert (the pickle salesman in ``Crossing Delancy'')
is ideal as the upwardly mobile ad man. John McMartin has strong
moments as the executive whose life burns out when he is forced
into early retirement. Swoosie Kurtz offers a convincing argument
for uxoricide.
   ``A Shock to the System,'' a Corsair Production release, is
rated R for language and adult material. Running time: 87 minutes.

   With spring comes baseball. And what better way to celebrate
America's favorite sport than by taking home a few videos.
   Hollywood once considered baseball movies box-office poison
because movie moguls thought women, who constitute a large part of
film-goers, wouldn't want to see them and foreign audiences simply
didn't understand the mechanics.
   Before the late 1980s, studio heads may have had a point. Some
of the all-time baseball classics, though warmly embraced by fans,
did lousy box office. Such movies as 1942's ``The Pride of the
Yankees,'' starring Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig were big
disappointments.
   However, ``The Natural,'' Robert Redford's allegorical movie in
1984 about a gifted player, and ``Bull Durham'' (1988), an amusing
and lusty tale of the minor leagues starring Kevin Costner and
Susan Sarandon, helped turn things around.
   The biggest grossing baseball movie of all time is last year's
``Field of Dreams,'' which had taken in $53.3 million by August.
``Bull Durham'' was second with $50.3 million. And the comedy
smash, ``Major League'' (1989), ran third with $48.5 million. All
three are on video.
   There are other baseball movies hard-core fans might want to
watch that will even be enjoyed by those who've never downed a hot
dog at the park.
   Here's a list of other baseball movies that are available on
video:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``College'' (1927): Buster Keaton as the unwitting jock who
tries to woe the love of his life through sports.
   
   ``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' (1949): Gene Kelly, Esther
Williams and Frank Sinatra in a lackluster musical directed by
Busby Berkeley.
   ``The Jackie Robinson Story'' (1950): A poignant and hard look
at baseball's ugly history: racism. One of best biographical
baseball movies ever made, starring Jackie Robinson as himself.
   ``Damn Yankees'' (1958): Lola gets whatever Lola wants. Stars
Gwen Verdon, Ray Walston and Tab Hunter.
   
   ``Bang the Drum Slowly'' (1973): Excellent performances by
Michael Moriarity and Robert de Niro as two baseball buddies who
together face tragedy. ``The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and
Motor Kings'' (1976): A delightful romp of a group of black
baseball players touring rural America in the 1930s. Nice touches
by James Earl Jones, Billy Dee Williams and Richard Pryor.
   ``The Bad News Bears'' (1976): The first of a string of kiddie
baseball flicks. But the first is definitely the best and the
funniest. Stars Tatum O'Neal and Walter Matthau.
   ``The Bad News Bears Go to Japan'' (1978): O'Neal and Matthau
wisely dropped out.
   ``The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training'' (1977): Bad news.
   ``It's My Turn'' (1980): A limp love story starring Jill
Clayburgh and Michael Douglas.
   ``Eight Men Out'' (1988): John Sayles tough look at the 1919
Black Sox scandal with a wonderful ensemble cast.
   ``Stealing Home'' (1988): A rambling study about a talented
baseball player whose life takes a turn when he learns about the
suicide of a young woman from his past.

   ``Here Comes the Groom'' (Sire) _ John Wesley Harding
   
   ``Bob Dylan is my father. Joan Baez is my mother. And I am their
bastard son,'' sings John Wesley Harding.
   Harding, who takes his name from a Dylan album, is a gleeful
musical vandal. On his debut album, he sounds eerily like Elvis
Costello, and even shares Costello's music publishing company and
two members of his former band, the Attractions. Harding's song
``Cathy's New Clown'' quotes from the Everly Brothers classic.
   But faster than anyone can spell ``derivative,'' Harding is
laughing. His thievery is so blatant, and he makes such a joke
about it, that it's thrown back in the face of people overly
concerned with originality in rock 'n' roll.
   Besides, it's awfully hard not to like this album.
   ``Wes'' is the real-life Wesley Harding Stace, a 24-year-old
Englishman who once aspired to be a sportscaster. His backup band,
the Good Liars, features former Costello rhythm section Bruce and
Pete Thomas and shares the Attractions' mastery of several
different styles.
   Harding doesn't hesitate to take them in all sorts of
directions: ``Affairs of the Heart,'' with its accordion and pedal
steel guitar, sounds like French country music.
   Some of ``Here Comes the Groom'' is like ``Get Happy'' with a
brass section, some is clearly folk-influenced. On ``The Devil in
Me,'' about the darker side of human nature, it's both in the same
song.
   Like Costello, Harding has the gift of gab. Words often pour out
faster than most human ears can pick up. There's little of
Costello's bitterness, however, as this couplet suggests: ``If
there's a nuclear winter, at least it will snow.''
   The cassette has 15 songs, and many of them are crackling good.
There are slower moments _ such as the uninspired folkie duet with
Peter Case, ``Things Snowball,'' and other cuts buried on Side 2.
But Harding has an unexpectedly high batting average on this
audacious debut.

   ``Pale'' (Columbia) _ Toad the Wet Sprocket
   
   Toad the Wet Sprocket's new album, ``Pale,'' exemplifies
everything that's wrong about the wheezing alternative rock scene.
   Far from the cutting edge, the underground scene has too many
imitators instead of innovators. The reigning gods are still
R.E.M., which methodically built a successful career with
originality and relentless work.
   Since the early 1980s, R.E.M. has had more impersonators than
Elvis Presley. Toad the Wet Sprocket is only the latest to emulate
the form rather than the substance of R.E.M.
   ``Pale'' is loaded with moody, slightly incongruous lyrics. The
guitar rock mixes the jangle and the drone. The cover's a grainy
picture of something indistinguishable and the band photo is blurry.
   Sound familiar?
   Admittedly, the failure of an entire genre is a tough burden to
place on the shoulders of an unassuming California rock band.
They're somewhat adept interpreters; the sound is more muscular
than ``Murmur'' era R.E.M. though the songs, of course, lack
distinctiveness.
   But it would be far better to see bands try to make their mark
with their own visions rather than someone else's.

   In 1936, the photographer Walker Evans worked with author James
Agee in Hale County, Ala., preparing an article on sharecropping
that later became their book ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men''
(1941).
   Artist Williams Christenberry was greatly influenced by the book
as a University of Alabama graduate student in 1960, and he began
photographing Hale County buildings and countryside primarily as
studies for his paintings.
   Evans and Christenberry met in 1961 and returned to Hale County
together in 1973.
   Photographs the two artists made in Hale County over a 50-year
period will be on display at the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth,
Texas, from April 27 to June 24.
   Following its run at the Amon Carter, ``Of Time and Place:
Walker Evans and Williams Christenberry'' will travel to the
Wichita Art Museum, Kansas, Dec. 1, 1990-Jan. 20, 1991; the
Portland Museum of Art, Maine, Feb. 17-April 14, 1991; and the
Friends of Photography, San Francisco, July 2-Sept. 9, 1991.

   On her emergence as a film director, Sondra
Locke makes an observation about gender.
   ``Women have to work twice as hard to be taken seriously,'' she
said. ``From my experience, what I had to fight against was my
association with Clint (Eastwood), because it automatically
disqualified me in some ways as being a separate entity or having
had to fight on my own. I was doing things before I met Clint.
   ``You have to fight harder. People don't stop and think how long
you have been around or what you may be on your own. There is a
wall. But if you just know who you are and keep plugging along,
sooner or later the little crack in the wall gets bigger. Pretty
soon you can put your foot through. Then you are able to emerge as
yourself.''
   With her second film as a director, ``Impulse,'' Sondra Locke
does emerge as a filmmaker who can be taken seriously. Unlike her
first effort, the largely unseen ``Ratboy,'' ``Impulse'' has the
elements for popular appeal. It's a cop movie, with Theresa Russell
as an undercover vice officer who can be as tough as Dirty Harry.
   The comparison to Clint Eastwood movies is unavoidable. But Miss
Locke's long professional and personal association with Eastwood
having reached a bitter ending, she is making strides in
establishing her own life and career.
   Breaking up was hard to do for both parties. Over 13 years she
had appeared in six Eastwood films, from ``The Outlaw Josey Wales''
to ``The Gauntlet,'' and they were close companions despite her
marriage to another man. They parted amid acrimony in December
1988, and last April she filed a palimony suit alleging cruel
treatment by Eastwood. It is still pending.
   Locke established her own fame in her first movie, ``The Heart
Is a Lonely Hunter,'' winning a 1968 Academy Award nomination as
supporting actress when she was only 17.
   Her ``discovery'' by Hollywood is so cliche-laden that it's hard
to believe.
   ``It's like a movie, bigger than life,'' she admitted. ``But
it's actually true. I was this girl in (Shelby) Tennessee. I wanted
to be an actress but was just out of school and didn't know how to
go about it.
   ``Suddenly Warner Bros. is having this talent search, and the
casting director, Marion Dougherty, is going from city to city. The
nearest city was Birmingham, Ala. I read about it in the paper. I
auditioned. The next thing I knew I was in New York, then I was in
Selma, Ala., shooting with Alan Arkin.
   ``The next thing I knew, I was in Hollywood, and then I was
nominated for an Academy Award. It was an amazing experience,
enough to confuse the brain.''
   More films followed (``Run Shadow Run, ``Willard''), then the
association with Eastwood. During those years she remained in the
shadow of a superstar, subordinating her own ambitions. How does
that reconcile with her strong feelings about a woman's role in
society?
   ``I've thought about that a great deal,'' she said. ``We go
through certain phases in our lives; we grow and change and get
different perspectives. For a time I thought that the only thing
that can be counted on is your work. You know exactly what you can
do, and you have control over it to some degree.
   ``That's not right, either. A relationship is very important;
sometimes that is how we find out about ourselves. From the breakup
of a relationship we find out even more. Hopefully, we can turn
that into creativity if we try hard.
   ``For a period in my life, a relationship was the most important
thing. Everything else was just very, very secondary. ... There's
no doubt that professionally I did go into a tunnel. Then it can be
exhilarating and challenging and exciting to try to come out of
it.''
   At 42, Sondra Locke has the same willowy blond beauty that she
displayed as the 14-year-old Mike Kelly in ``The Heart Is a Lonely
Hunter.'' Don't be fooled by her seeming fragility. On a movie set
she can be commanding and decisive. For ``Impulse'' she prowled the
mean streets of Los Angeles with a homicide squad to soak up how
the police operate.
   And she scorns any suggestion that women cannot direct action.
   ``The thing that posed the challenge in my mind was not the
action per se,'' she said. ``When I think about action, I only
think about `what happens.' I see it in my head as a movie. I don't
stop and say, `Ooo, this is action!' If you tell the story of
what's happening, it kind of takes care of itself.''
   Are the wounds of the Eastwood affair beginning to heal?
   ``I think I've learned a lot,'' she said hesitantly. ``I'm proud
of that. I had to be a lot stronger than I ever knew that I could
be. I had to learn to stand up for myself and decide who I am, what
I need and what's right. If you look on that as a positive instead
of a negative, then I would say that yes, I am healing.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Classical Singer Reaches for Allah's Message</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALAMA IQBAL, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nustrah Fateh Ali Khan rocks back
and forth as he sings in a machine gun-like style. The low beat of
tabla drums provides an eerie backbeat to the staccato rhythms of
his voice.
   Six handclappers provide more cadence, and two harmoniums flesh
out the tune as Khan stretches his arms to the heavens to receive
Allah's ``direct message.''
   The all-male crowd, assembled in this village near Lahore in
eastern Pakistan, rocks to the beat. Several bearded men, wearing
intricately-crocheted skull caps, sway to the front. One collapses
on the earthen floor, twitching in a religious trance.
   Listeners throw rupee notes on the singer and his band. By the
time the night is through, Khan has collected 40,000 rupees
($2,000).
   He is one of Pakistan's great singers. He practices an art
called qawalli, part of Pakistan's rich tradition of classical
music.
   Today, Khan's art form is going through a revival of sorts, a
byproduct of the increasing availability of cassette tapes and the
failure of fundamentalist religious thinkers to impose their strict
ideas on the masses.
   Khan and his band came to Alama Iqbal to commemorate the death
of the town's largest landlord, who died four years ago.
   Following Islamic tradition, peasants and workers from a nearby
scrap metal plant have been invited to the show. A huge tent houses
the guests, about 2,000 in all.
   Women are not present. Strict Moslem tradition bans them from
casual contact with male strangers. Still, several little girls in
brightly colored shalwar kameez, the traditional baggy pants and
knee-length tunic, flit through the crowd, clutching their fathers'
hands.
   Khan comes from a family that has been singing for more than 600
years. From Ghazni, now part of Afghanistan, his family went to
India during the time of the great Mogul empire that dominated the
subcontinent for centuries.
   Soon Khan's relatives were singing for the Mogul court. Moslem
rulers used Khan's forefathers to spread Islam through India,
combining Islam's tradition of religious poetry with the wild music
of India.
   Khan's family came to Pakistan in 1947, following the partition
of the subcontinent into a Moslem country, Pakistan, and a largely
Hindu nation, India.
   At that time, his father and uncle were the leaders of a famed
qawalli band and played in mosques and villages throughout Punjab
province.
   ``In the beginning, they wanted me to become a doctor because
classical singing is too hard,'' Khan said in an interview at a
small hotel in the heart of Lahore.
   But the young boy persevered, listening to his father teach
other pupils from behind a curtain in the family's house.
   ``One day he caught me. First he scolded me but then he
encouraged me,'' he said.
   Khan's training was cut short by his father's death in 1964 when
he was 16. A heavy mantle passed to his shoulders.
   ``I remember his first concert,'' said Khalid Asghar, a senior
music producer at Pakistan Broadcasting Corp. ``He was a little
round-faced chap. He sang with vigor.''
   As he grew older, Khan became enormously fat. He now weighes 350
pounds.
   Khan is not blessed with a beautiful or melodic voice, but it
has a haunting power and his rhythm, a key element of qawalli
singing, is impeccable.
   ``His voice is like an ugly woman who becomes a great actress,''
said Asghar. ``Tghere is so much art in him that you forget about
the ugliness.''
   When he sings, Khan says, he forgets who and where he is.
   ``It is a direct message,'' he says, pointing to the sky.
   In the past few years, Khan has achieved some international
stature. Rock artist Peter Gabriel released a Khan record on his
Realworld label last year. He has sung in Paris, London and at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York.
   Over the past few years his music has become increasingly
popular in Pakistan, partly a result of its good beat and the
ambiguity of his lyrics.
   ``Your eyes have made me drunk,'' goes one song. ``Your
willingness and your love make me a drunken man.''
   Some would interpret the couplet as a celebration of Allah, the
Moslem god. Others imbue it with more earthly charms.

   When John Hanson Mitchell's marriage
ended in 1986, he abandoned the modern world and moved alone to a
cabin in the woods to live like his ``mentor,'' Henry David Thoreau.
   But during his year without electricity and running water,
Mitchell discovered what he calls a timeless truth that may be more
suited to this generation.
   In an upcoming book based on his experiment in the woods,
Mitchell decries the materialism of modern times and advocates a
return to the simpler values of Thoreau's mid-19th century.
   ``The essence of civilization is not the multiplication of
wants, but the elimination of needs,'' says Mitchell, 49, standing
on his land, just 16 miles from Walden Pond.
   That sentiment may sound a bit ponderous and pretentious, but
Mitchell is not. He is the first to tell you that his year in the
woods, titled ``Living at the End of Time,'' involved more than
just giving up a CD player and the Cuisinart.
   Though he continued work as editor of a small magazine, Mitchell
returned home to his cabin every night. It was there that he gained
a peace and contentment he says comes from living close to the
land. He calls it a ``satisfying feeling, a comfort'' that he
believes is difficult to achieve in the fast-track world.
   But the hardest part came before Mitchell even moved into his
cabin _ when his wife decided they should separate. At the time,
the couple lived in a house on the edge of dense woods in this
rural suburb 35 miles west of Boston.
   Mitchell moved to a nearby apartment but found he missed his
land. His attachment to the land, a square-mile of nearly
undeveloped woods of which Mitchell owns four acres, is more than
sentimental. Several years ago, he chronicled the 15,000-year
history of the land, called Scratch Flat, in a book.
   ``There does seem to be some sort of draw here, some sort of
historical presence,'' he says. ``This place seems more alive than
others.''
   Mitchell says he and his wife separated amicably. His son and
daughter often stayed with him in his cabin. ``I look at these
things as more tribal,'' he says of the split. ``Marriages don't
break up. People just move into different huts.''
   Mitchell also had a practical reason for building his one-room
gingerbread-style cabin. He needed some ``affordable housing.''
   The Gothic-style cottage was built by Mitchell using Thoreau's
shack and the designs of mid-19th century architect Andrew Jackson
Downing for inspiration. It was constructed on a ridge hidden
behind thick woods, about 400 yards from his former house and the
road. In the winter, Mitchell had to ski through the woods to get
to his house.
   In the warm months, Mitchell often spent hours sitting outside
his cottage, contemplating the surrounding meadows and trees. He
took long walks in the woods and met an assortment of characters: a
family of Eastern European refugees who lived on a small farm, a
mysterious man who dressed partly in animal skins and said he lived
in a cave.
   In the winter, he stoked his small camp stove for warmth and
huddled under heavy blankets. He reread the classics and read the
journals kept by Thoreau as well as his own father.
   Most important, he said, was his feeling of oneness with nature,
a feeling that all the ``windows and walls separating me'' had been
removed.
   ``Sometimes I would even go for night walks ... picking my way
along the trail by watching the sky. The stars had never seemed so
bright,'' Mitchell writes. ``I became acutely conscious of the
changing position of what quarter the moon was in. Some nights,
when I was alone in the cottage, I wouldn't bother to light the
lamps. I would simply sit there in the dark, watching moonlight
spill in through the windows ... listening to the sounds around
me.''
   Mitchell's spartan life in the woods was made ironic by the
construction of a huge Digital Equipment Corp. plant nearby.
Mitchell grew obsessed with the encroachment of the plant and ``the
loyal penitents, the programmers and the engineers,'' who worked
there. After weeks of attempts, he finally befriended an employee
who took him on a tour of the plant.
   Mitchell has since moved to a new house he had built just a few
yards from the cottage. This one has electricity and modern
comforts but Mitchell says he has retained what he learned in his
one room.
   ``The lesson is, you don't have to live in a cottage in the
woods to strip yourself of a lot of material possessions,'' he
says. ``There are deeper satisfactions.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Ronstadt Expands on Musical Style Once Again</HEAD>

   In Linda Ronstadt's 23-year career she has
changed from a lovesick pop covergirl into a soulful country
crooner, a 1940s-style torch singer and a caballero-outfitted
Mexican folksinger.
   Now she's re-entered the pop scene and stolen hearts with the
album ``Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind.'' The first
single from the album, a duet with Aaron Neville called ``I Don't
Know Much,'' won a Grammy award this year for best pop vocal by a
duo or group.
   Despite her chameleon-like, seemingly whimsical career moves,
there's a method to Ronstadt's madness: She just has to sing, no
matter what the style.
   ``I feel pressure to make order out of chaos and I do this with
music. I mean it. That is what I need to do. I think that is why
people make art,'' she said.
   ``If I didn't make a living trying to make order out of chaos
with my music, I would get a job selling hot dogs, or whatever else
I could find that would do it.''
   Ronstadt said the songs on ``Cry Like a Rainstorm'' have been
her ``friends'' for years, and the time was right to record them.
The same could be said for all the songs she's recorded.
   ``It becomes kind of your best friend and you think about it and
talk to it every day. And then you have to record it,'' she said.
``It's just those songs became ripe, in their way, and they became
current, and I needed to sing them.''
   Sitting in the office of her longtime manager and friend, Peter
Asher, Ronstadt does not look like a veteran star. Her face remains
unlined, and she wears playful cowboy boots adorned with
multicolored designs.
   In the two decades she's been in the business she's learned that
the songs are the important thing, not what people think. ``The
singing that I do with my hands in the dishwater is just as
meaningful to me, and maybe a little bit more, than the singing I
do in front of 40,000 people.''
   Her new LP gave Ronstadt the opportunity to work with Neville,
who is one of her idols.
   Neville, an angelic-sounding singer who had a Top-10 song in
1967 with ``Tell It Like It Is,'' is a part of the Neville
Brothers, a critically acclaimed band known for a contemporary New
Orleans sound.
   Ronstadt first met Neville when she went to the World's Fair in
New Orleans several years ago to perform with Nelson Riddle. The
members of the orchestra all wanted to see the Neville Brothers, so
they ventured out to find them.
   ``We found them playing at this club and Aaron found out somehow
I was there and dedicated a song to me,'' Ronstadt said. ``I was
certain I was the only female on the planet and I was sure I was
the only person in the room listening to him sing. Just me and him.
It was one of those moments _ those transcendental moments.''
   Later in the evening, Ronstadt and Neville sang a duet, and
their voices ``clicked.''
   ``I thought, well, maybe this is really happening,'' she said.
``Then I thought maybe every singer in the world would just like to
think their voice sounded good with Aaron's, because Aaron sounds
so good.''
   For years the two tried to find a project together, but the
opportunity didn't arise until ``Cry Like a Rainstorm.''
   Ronstadt envisioned the songs on the album as stacked orchestral
arrangements recorded in a huge, natural-sounding studio.
Unfortunately, she discovered, there aren't many of those around.
Still, she refused to give up.
   ``I just kept thinking BIG. I needed a big room because I wanted
big sound and a big orchestra and a big choir and I wanted big
voices and I wanted big guitars and big drums.''
   Ronstadt got her wish. She recorded the album at Skywalker
Ranch, a compound in California's Marin County owned by filmmaker
George Lucas. She also got a 100-piece orchestra, an authentic
gospel choir and the haunting voices of Neville and former Beach
Boy Brian Wilson.
   The ``Cry Like a Rainstorm'' album is a definite departure from
her past work, but Ronstadt admits she's never been content to sit
still with her career.
   In 1967, Ronstadt first surfaced with the group The Stone
Ponies, a sort of country-pop-folk group that landed their sole hit
with ``Different Drum.'' The Stone Ponies were the forerunners of
the laidback Southern California sound captured by the Eagles,
Jackson Brown and Fleetwood Mac.
   Ronstadt went solo soon thereafter and scored hits with songs
such as ``Heatwave,'' ``You're No Good'' and ``When Will I be
Loved.'' She was so well known she sang at the 1977 inauguration of
President Jimmy Carter.
   Then in the early 1980s Ronstadt departed from her pop roots and
took on a role in the musical ``The Pirates of Penzance.''
   Though it wasn't much of a leap of faith for fans to accept her
part in the musical, Ronstadt then took her craft another step
beyond and became a 40s-style torch singer and recorded with the
Nelson Riddle Orchestra.
   The songs, the orchestra and the prom-style 40s dresses were
unexpected but not rejected. The album gave her maturing voice a
new forum and gained new respect from critics who dismissed her in
the '70s as just another pretty face.
   From there she moved into country music with the ``Trio'' album,
teaming her with Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton and featuring
17th-century Appalachian folk songs.
   She went her own way again and moved into traditional Mexican
folk music with the album ``Canciones de mi Padre.'' Ronstadt, who
is half German and half Mexican, said the songs she sang in Spanish
made her feel grounded.
   Now, there's work with Neville.
   ``When Dolly, Emmy and I sang together there was that buzz. We'd
all sang with other people before but when we sang together _ the
three of us _ we liked it. And we felt, `This is special. We have
to do this.' I felt the same way about Aaron.''
   Ronstadt says she's not an innovator or trendsetter. She's a
singer and that's all she ever wanted to be.
   ``When I was in first grade I flunked arithmetic. Since then I
have developed a great awe and appreciation for mathematics. But in
first grade it wasn't happening and I remember looking at my report
card and thinking, `It doesn't matter, I'm going to be a singer.'''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Clint Black Misses Fishing</HEAD>

   Clint Black has one regret about being
the hottest emerging country music star of 1990.
   ``I don't get to fish much anymore,'' the 28-year-old singer
says.
   There's little time to head for a lake and cast for a big one.
For the past year, he's been crisscrossing the country on a
whirlwind schedule as the most promising country performer since
Randy Travis blossomed in 1986.
   His debut album, ``Killin' Time,'' sold 1 million copies in nine
months. Three cuts from the LP all were No. 1 on the country music
popularity charts: ``A Better Man,'' ``Killin' Time'' and
``Nobody's Home.''
   ``I'm spoiled rotten,'' he jokes about his quick success.
   How is he handling it?
   ``With a bullwhip.''
   It's not just Black's voice that has caught the fancy of country
fans. It's also his looks. He has a friendly face accented by
dimples and a mischievous grin. And with his omnipresent black
cowboy hat, many people believe he looks like a young Roy Rogers.
   He has the familiar background of a dirt-to-diamonds country
singer. He was born in Long Branch, N.J., where his father had a
temporary job working on a pipe line. He grew up in Houston where
he was a frequent sight on the streets riding a skateboard while
playing a harmonica. He first performed for guests at his parents'
backyard barbecues.
   He dropped out of high school in Houston and toiled as an
ironworker and fishing guide. He sang in nightclubs after sending
out fliers to advertise his performances. He finally drew the
attention of RCA Records, which signed him to a recording contract.
   But he hasn't forgotten his hardscrabble days.
   ``I think about it all the time,'' he said. ``There's always
something that takes me back to that. I used to sing five hours a
night, sometimes seven. Iron working was hard and dangerous enough
to run me off. But it all shaped my life.''
   His album, which has been No. 1 on the country charts, is mostly
well-crafted country weepers about lost love, with a background of
beers and barrooms. The music, much of which he wrote himself, is
rooted in the Western swing and honky-tonk style of Texas.
   The cut ``Killin' Time'' deals with drinking to forget a broken
romance. ``A Better Man'' is about recovering from the pain of
losing a lover. ``Nobody's Home'' is about the emotional letdown
after failing at love.
   ``The first thing a country music listener latches onto is
whether the words mean anything to them,'' Black says. ``You need
to be able to say something anybody can relate to.
   ```Nobody's Home' was written after a seven-year split-up. I had
regrets. We got back together and split up again. This inspired `A
Better Man.' Other than that, the songs are just somebody else's
story. We took their perspective.''
   His music and tireless work have paid off rapidly. In October,
he won the Horizon Award from the Country Music Association for
achievement by a rising performer. In January, he won an American
Music Award for favorite new country artist.
   He's performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City. And he was
especially thrilled to sing for a crowd of 56,000 in Houston in
February. ``It was etched in my mind for a long time since it was a
hometown show and everything,'' he said.
   His future schedule is packed. He'll tape a Bob Hope TV special
in Acapulco, Mexico. He'll be on the road an average of four nights
a week doing concerts with the superstar group Alabama. He's
working on a second album due out this fall.
   ``It's satisfying to make it through a crazy week,'' he said.
``The only frustration I have is if I can't perform because my
vocal chords are worn out from too much use.
   ``I've been careful to shape my attitude. I travel with my band,
and we hold nothing back. If anyone gets out of line, we answer to
each other. We pay attention to what we do and how we act.
   ``I don't want to be a temperamental artist. The band lets me
know if I'm being unreasonable about something. I want to make sure
people are proud to be with me 10 years down the road.
   ``I really have believed in my songs. I feel I know when they
are good or just OK. It's pretty scary to think that there's got to
come a time when a song won't be number one. It's inevitable.''

   The loss for the January through March period, which Shearson

more than twice as large as the industry's biggest quarterly loss

   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks

   A reading below 50 indicates the manufacturing economy generally

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in the latest auction to their lowest level in
several weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $8.0 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.83 percent on Monday, down from

   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.72
percent on Feb. 26, and six-month bills averaged 7.79 percent on

$9,605.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. hopes a
record Wall Street loss of around $900 million for the first
quarter will put the bad days of overexpansion firmly behind it.
   The nation's second largest securities firm said the stunning
loss would include $787 million in one-time charges, including
writeoffs of its real estate and junk bond holdings as well as
provisions for the costs of shutting down scores of offices and
dismissing 2,000 employees.
   The red ink also will include a loss of $110 million to $130
million on operations, the company announced late Monday.
   ``The steps that Shearson Lehman Hutton is announcing today
signal the start of a new era for the firm,'' said James D.
Robinson III, chairman and chief executive of Shearson's parent,
American Express Co.
   Much of Wall Street is struggling to cut costs because of a
slowdown in trading since the 1987 stock market crash and a big
decline in securities underwriting and merger activity.
   But Shearson expanded more rapidly than any firm during the
go-go 1980s, making its current retrenchment more painful and more
costly than any other firm's.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the nation's biggest investment firm,
posted the industry's biggest quarterly loss to date only three
months ago _ a fourth-quarter 1989 loss of $362 million after
charges for major cutbacks.
   Shearson's staggering charge was bigger than the $450 million to
$700 million many analysts forecast last month after Shearson
announced plans to close offices, cut jobs and write down its real
estate and junk bond portfolios.
   Shearson said restructuring charges would amount to about $630
million. That includes $200 million for estimated losses at its
commercial real estate subsidiary, The Balcor Co.; $230 million for
office consolidation and closings worldwide; $115 million to cover
losses on the planned sale of $480 million in junk bonds, and $45
million in employee severance costs.
   The securities firm said it would close 67 domestic branch
offices, up from a previously announced target of 50.
   In addition, Shearson said it would take a $157 million charge
for an accounting change relating to software development expenses.
The change would bring the way Shearson accounts for such expenses
into line with how American Express does it.
   The total charge would exceed the industry record of $470
million taken by Merrill Lynch in the 1989 fourth quarter. Shearson
said its actions would reduce annual costs by ``well in excess of
$400 million.''
   ``They seem to be clearing the deck and then will go forward
from here,'' said Perrin Long, who follows the securities industry
for Lipper Analytical Services Corp.
   The charges and cutbacks will help Shearson focus on its four
core businesses of individual investor services, investment
banking, capital markets and asset management, said Howard L. Clark
Jr., a former American Express executive who was installed as
Shearson's chairman earlier this year.
   Shearson cited a marked slowdown in business activity in January
and February for its expected first-quarter operating loss of $110
million to $130 million.
   Overall, the firm said it expects to post a loss of $897 million
to $917 million for the quarter. Shearson lost $15 million in the
1989 first quarter.
   After Shearson's announcement, Moody's Investors Service Inc.
said it had confirmed its senior debt ratings on about $4.8 billion
in Shearson debt.
   ``Both the special provisions as well as the operating loss were
consistent with expectations in view of Shearson's problem asset
exposures and depressed conditions in the wholesale and retail
securities markets,'' Moody's said.
   It also cited Shearson's ``close relationship'' with American
Express.
   After an initial recapitalization plan to breathe life into
Shearson fell through early this year, American Express abandoned
plans to reduce its stake in Shearson and decided to take full
control of its securities unit to avoid a credit downgrading.
   Last week, American Express said a previously announced $750
million capital infusion had been made available to Shearson.
American Express will have pumped about $1.35 billion into Shearson
in recent months once the recapitalization plan is completed.
   The company also installed Clark as Shearson's chairman and
embarked on the cost-cutting program. Shearson has excess capacity
because of its 1988 acquisition of E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. and diminished
stock trading.
   Shearson, with about 33,500 employees, is the second largest
Wall Street firm behind Merrill Lynch.

<HEAD>Farley Unit Defaults On Pepperell Buyout Loan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After defaulting on a bank loan and saying it
couldn't pay interest on its junk bonds, analysts say Farley Inc.
may be forced to sell more assets if it ever hopes to complete its
buyout of West Point-Pepperell Inc.
   ``This makes it more difficult,'' said Edward Johnson of Johnson
Redbook Service Inc., a New York research firm.
   ``The rumors are that he might sell off Fruit of the Loom to get
his interest out of it,'' Johnson said, referring to William
Farley, chairman of the closely held Chicago-based manufacturing
conglomerate.
   A Farley division that was created to acquire Pepperell said
Monday it had defaulted on a $796 million bank loan and would be
unable to pay interest owed to holders of $705 million in junk
bonds.
   The announcement increased doubts about Farley's ability to
complete his $3 billion acquisition of the big Georgia textile
maker.
   Farley officials did not return telephone calls seeking details
on the moves outlined in the company's three-paragraph statement.
   The statement said the Farley unit, West Point Acquisition
Corp., had offered to give stock to junk bond holders in exchange
for a delay in making interest payments.
   West Point Acquisition also said it had been negotiating with
its lenders, a consortium of banks led by Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and
Bankers Trust Co., apparently in hopes of restructuring the $796
million loan they made last year so the Farley unit could buy
Pepperell stock.
   Unless the loan is restructured, analysts said, Farley could be
forced into bankruptcy proceedings or be obliged to sell assets,
possibly including Fruit of the Loom Inc., the country's biggest
underwear manufacturer.
   West Point Acquisition said the defaults would not affect West
Point-Pepperell, which continues to trade as a public company on
the New York Stock Exchange even though the Farley unit owns about
95 percent of its stock.
   Farley, who paid $1.56 billion for its Pepperell stock and
assumed $1 billion of the company's debt, still needs about $85
million to complete his $58-a-share acquisition of Pepperell's
stock. Until the deal is concluded, he cannot use Pepperell's cash
to pay interest on the buyout debt.
   Pepperell's stock fell $1.25 to $37 a share Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange. Fruit of the Loom, traded on the American
Stock Exchange, fell 25 cents to $12.87{.
   About two weeks ago, Farley announced a renegotiated $1.2
billion loan that gave his manufacturing conglomerate more time to
complete the Pepperell buyout and eliminated the danger of a
cross-default by Pepperell in case of a default by West Point
Acquisition.
   Two days later, Farley announced the sale of most of its Cluett,
Peabody &amp; Co. division to the French clothing maker Bidermann S.A.
for $350 million and a $60 million note. However, the price was
about $200 million less than Farley had sought.
   Farley has been stymied by the downturn in the takeover business
that followed the collapse of the junk bond market last fall.
   Banks have been extremely cautious about backing acquisitions
since the failure of Campeau Corp.'s $6.7 billion buyout of
Federated Department Stores Inc., a deal heavily dependent on junk
bonds. Federated and Allied Stores Corp., another U.S. retailer
bought by Campeau, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
in January.
   Farley used junk bonds extensively during the 1980s to finance
the growth of his holdings, which also include the Acme Boot Co.

<HEAD>Breeden Says Anti-Buyout Laws Could Weaken Shareholder Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission criticized proposed changes in state takeover laws like
those being considered in Pennsylvania, saying they seek to ``tilt
the balance'' against shareholders.
   ``Significant efforts are underway at the state level to shield
management from shareholder oversight,'' Richard C. Breeden told
the Council of Institutional Investors, a group of pension fund
managers, on Monday.
   ``Pennsylvania, Indiana and other states recently have sought to
tilt the balance of corporate power in favor of corporate
management and against shareholders by insulating decisions by
boards of directors from effective review either by the judiciary
or shareholders,'' he added.
   Although most proposed legislation is not in its final form,
``the U.S. Supreme Court has indicated clearly that states do have
the ability to legislate in takeover areas,'' said Randall
Schumann, a spokesman for the North American Securities
Administrators Association, a nationwide organization of state
level securities regulators.
   Supporters of the pending Pennsylvania legislation have hailed
it as the nation's toughest anti-takeover sanction, but critics
warn it could discourage long-term investment because corporate
officers would be less accountable for their actions.
   Breeden said federal regulators were concerned about state
legislation that would ``insulate managers and boards from
shareholders'' and thus, possibly cause institutional investors to
shift much-needed capital from securities like stocks to those
based on debt _ like junk bonds.
   That would make it tougher for U.S. businesses to raise large
sums of money for long-range goals like plant expansion, research
and development.
   ``Who wants to be a long-term captive investor?'' Breeden asked
rhetorically.
   The legislation, passed by the Pennsylvania Senate and awaiting
action in the House, would make it more difficult for corporate
raiders to take over a Pennsylvania company or extract
``greenmail'' _ above-market prices paid by management to buy back
the company's stock from would-be raiders.
   The bill also would give corporate boards far more discretion
than they have now to consider interests other than those of the
shareholders in making decisions about takeover bids.
   Breeden said shareholder input in running a company is
guaranteed under federal law and ``while we respect'' states'
rights in matters of corporate governance, ``we will not hesitate
to seek to enforce federal interests.''
   Breed also said the SEC was reviewing the shareholder voting and
proxy process, especially changes recommended by the California
Public Employees Retirement System and a shareholders' rights
group, the United Shareholders Association. A proxy is a
shareholder's absentee ballot for a company's annual meeting.

<HEAD>Bonds Cause $836 Million Quarterly Loss at Big Insurance Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Executive Corp. said the plunging value
of its junk bond holdings caused it to post an $836 million loss in
the fourth quarter and a $776 million loss for 1989.
   The insurance holding company, whose subsidiaries include
Executive Life Insurance Co. of Los Angeles, announced in January
that it anticipated an after tax charge of $515 million to 1989
earnings due to junk bond losses. It said Monday the losses were so
bad it had added another $344 million to the charge.
   The huge writeoffs caused revenue to plunge 44 percent for the
year and left third-quarter revenue more than a half-billion
dollars in the red.
   Los Angeles-based First Executive became the second Southern
California institution in as many days to be buried beneath an
avalanche of losses from junk bonds, which pay high rates because
they fund risky ventures.
   On Sunday, Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association reported losses
of $575 million in a five-month period due to junk bonds. The
losses rendered Columbia insolvent and in danger of seizure by
federal regulators.
   Both First Executive and Columbia were closely allied with
Michael Milken, the financier who pioneered the use of junk bonds
in the 1980s while working for the Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
brokerage.
   First Executive invested about $6.5 billion in junk bonds. It
said that as of Dec. 31, when its fourth quarter and fiscal year
ended, the value of that portfolio had declined about $1.4 billion
below face value.
   For the fourth quarter, First Executive's $836 million loss, the
equivalent of $9.98 a share, compared to a profit of $48 million,
or 42 cents a share, in 1988. Revenue plunged far into red ink:
from $552 million in 1988 to a negative $541 million in 1989.
   For the year, First Executive's $776 million loss was the
equivalent of $9.67 a share and came on revenue of $1.19 billion.
That compared with a profit of $175 million, $1.51 per share, on
revenue of $2.14 billion in 1988.
   First Executive said its assets at the end of the year were
about $19.2 billion and shareholders' equity more than $1 billion.
Life insurance in force was about $59.7 billion compared with $57.3
billion last year.

<HEAD>Southland Reports $1.01 Billion Loss Because Of Goodwill Writedown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   7-Eleven owner Southland Corp. lost $1 billion in
the fourth quarter of 1989 after a huge takeover-related writeoff,
and the company said earnings this year wouldn't meet targets set
in its bank financing agreements.
   The convenience store company said Monday it would have to
restructure its debt or file for bankruptcy protection.
   Dallas-based Southland said a $947 million writeoff wiped its
books clean of goodwill, or the difference between what the
convenience store company was worth and the $4.9 billion the
founding Thompson family paid in 1987 to take the company private.
   ``The market values that we established in 1987 are not the same
as they (are) two years later,'' said spokeswoman Markeeta McNatt.
``It's not necessarily that we paid too much, but the events since
then have impaired the value of those assets.''
   Terms of the buyout was announced prior to the Oct. 19, 1987
stock market crash, but the deal was not financed until after the
crash.
   Southland has been struggling to meet the payments on the LBO
debt.
   Last month it announced a recapitalization plan involving the
sale of $400 million of Southland stock to Ito-Yokado Ltd., which
operates 7-Eleven stores in Japan. The sale would give Ito-Yokado
75 percent of the common stock, and leave about 15 percent in
Thompson hands.
   The deal is contingent on bondholders approving the
restructuring of some $1.8 billion in debt and preferred stock.
Most analysts have suggested bondholders, who would forego about
$1.4 billion, will not agree to the deal.
   Complete details have yet to be filed with the federal
Securities and Exchange Commission, and Ms. McNatt said
negotiations with bondholders can't begin until those details are
available.
   Jay Lustig, an analyst at Drake Capital Corp. in Santa Monica,
Calif., said bondholders will not accept the restructuring,
especially if the Thompsons continue to run the company.
   ``Bondholders no longer want the Thompsons running the
company,'' he said. ``It's not their company. There is no positive
net worth. This now means the creditors own the company.''
   Lustig said bondholders would prefer Southland to declare
bankruptcy rather than continue under Thompson leadership.
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Southland said it lost $1.01
billion, or $4.92 a share, on revenues of $2.1 billion. That
compares with a loss of $37 million, or 22 cents a share, on
revenues of $1.97 billion in the same three months of 1988.
   For all of 1989, the company lost $1.31 billion, or $6.48 a
share, on $8.35 billion in revenue, compared with a 1988 loss of
$216.2 million, or $1.22 a share, on $7.99 billion in sales.
   Southland operates about 6,900 7-Eleven stores in addition to
five distribution centers that service more than 5,900 stores in
the United States and 21 foreign countries.

<HEAD>Bids Entered for Bonwit Teller Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several regional retailers, a French department
store and real estate tycoon Donald Trump have made offers for
Bonwit Teller department stores, but efforts by a former executive
of the bankrupt chain to make a bid collapsed.
   A group that included former chief executive William Ruben and
Remington Products Inc. president Victor Kiam said it was prepared
to offer $36 million for 13 of Bonwit's 16 stores if given two more
days to secure financing.
   That would have been the biggest bid of any entered at a
bankruptcy court hearing Monday. Bonwit's creditors refused to
grant the two-day extension, though, saying a delay could threaten
the other firm bids.
   A consortium including Trump bid $21.75 million for five Bonwit
Teller department stores, including the chain's flagship outlet in
Manhattan's glitzy Trump Tower. The other stores covered by the bid
included Bonwit Teller properties in Boston, Buffalo and Manhasset,
N.Y., and Short Hills, N.J.
   The group would forgive $269,000 in financial obligations on the
stores in Trump Tower and Short Hills and match whatever the final
bid is for liquidating the inventory at the Boston and Buffalo
stores. The Bonwit Teller name would be retained.
   The terms of the proposal are similar to ones in a plan
presented earlier by Pyramid Cos., a Syracuse, N.Y.-based shopping
mall developer and owner.
   Pyramid, operating as Bontel Corp., is part of the consortium
but also left its own bid intact. The earlier Pyramid plan,
submitted to Bonwit Teller's parent company L.J. Hooker Corp. on
March 9, called for buying the same five stores for $16.5 million
plus the assumption of some liabilities.
   Besides Bontel and Trump Equitable Fifth Ave. Corp., which is
part of the Trump Organization, the consortium includes Prutaub, a
joint venture that operates the Short Hills Mall, and Pilevsky
Group, headed by Philip Pilevsky a New York real estate owner.
   Members of the consortium also presented bids for individual
stores and other potential buyers submitted plans at the hearing.
   Atlanta-based L.J. Hooker has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection from creditors since August, after its Australian parent
company, Hooker Corp., entered ``provisional liquidation,'' an
Australian legal proceeding similar to bankruptcy.
   Since then, L.J. Hooker has sold holdings and late last year
liquidated the B. Altman &amp; Co. department store chain.
   The hearing before Judge Tina Brozman was held to consider
possible alternatives to the Pyramid offer.
   Bidders were obliged to put up 10 percent of their offers.
Lawyers for Hooker said the company will decide which bid _ or bids
_ are acceptable and make a recommendation on Wednesday to the
judge, who must approve any deal.
   Among offers entered at Monday's hearing was one from R.H.
Acquisition Corp. on behalf of Ralph Hibbard, a Canadian investor
with past retailing experience. Hibbard offered more than $7
million cash for stores in Bal Harbour and Palm Beach, Fla., Troy,
Mich., Philadelphia and Jenkintown, Pa.
   Frances Brewster Inc., an upscale Florida men's and women's
apparel retailer, offered to pay $2.2 million for the lease on the
Palm Beach Bonwit Teller plus the liquidation value of the store's
inventory. The company, which operates a shop on tony Worth Avenue
virtually across the street from the Bonwit Teller, would not
retain the Bonwit Teller name.
   A French retailer, Galeries Lafayette, offered to buy only the
Trump Tower store for $4 million. The sum essentially would be for
the inventory. The retailer would keep the Bonwit Teller name for
135 days and then change it over to its own for the autumn season.
   McCurdy &amp; Co., a Rochester, N.Y.-based operator of apparel
retailers in upstate New York, offered $1.5 million for the lease,
equipment and furnishings of the Buffalo store. It also would pay
60 percent of the wholesale cost of the retail inventory for a
maximum bid of $3 million.
   The Limited Inc., a Columbus, Ohio-based specialty apparel
retailer, offered to buy the leases on the Boston and Buffalo
stores for $4 million evenly divided between the two.
   There was a separate $1.75 million bid for the lease on the Troy
store from Somerset Mall Ltd. partnership, which operates the site
of the store. A lawyer for the mall said it was unclear whether the
Bonwit name would be retained.
   Consortium members bid individually in case their joint offer
was rejected. Trump Equitable bid $5 million for the lease on the
Trump Tower store, Bontel bid $5.5 million for leases on the Boston
and Buffalo stores plus the inventory at liquidation prices and the
rights to the name. Pilevsky bid $5.5 million just for the
Manhasset property.
   Hooker also received two bids to liquidate the Bonwit Teller
chain valuing the inventory at about 50 cents on the dollar.

<HEAD>Builder Refinances 150 Properties In $456 Million Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trammell Crow Co., the nation's largest commercial
and residential builder, has refinanced more than 150 properties
using $456 million pumped into the company by a large institutional
investor.
   The injection by an arm of Equitable Life Assurance Society was
regarded as a positive move for the company and for the troubled
real estate market in the Southwest, where most of the properties
are located, analysts said.
   ``Our attorneys tell us that this is one of the largest real
estate transactions ever done in terms of the number of properties
involved,'' said Robert Whitman, Trammell Crow's chief financial
officer. ``It is probably the single largest capital commitment
made in the Southwest recently.''
   The investment by Equitable Real Estate Investment Management
Inc. comes against a backdrop of rumors of financial trouble for
Dallas-based Trammell Crow.
   ``I hope this transaction will have a very positive effect on
the Trammell Crow Co. and give the naysayers a new perspective,''
said Douglas Tibbets, president of Equitable Real Estate.
   ``I think the whole business is in extremely fragile condition
right now,'' said Richard Kateley, chief economist at Real Estate
Research Corp. in Chicago. ``And not just in Texas, but the whole
marketplace could react negatively to any bad news from a major
player like Trammell Crow.
   ``If this transaction had not closed, it would have been a real
depressing signal,'' he said.
   The refinancing includes both performing and non-performing
properties centered in Texas, Arizona and Colorado. About 70
percent are industrial buildings, the warehouses and distribution
buildings on which Trammel Crow founded its business more than 40
years ago.
   ``The majority of it is just good old solid property,'' said
Charles Klepfer, Equitable's regional senior vice president.
   ``These under-performing properties are some of our best
projects,'' said Whitman. ``It's just that they were built at a
time when the Southwest was depressed and the rental rates were
down.''
   ``We thought that if we could address such a significant portion
(of the company's problem properties) in one transaction, we could
get it all behind it,'' Whitman said.
   ``We wanted to remove the sword of Damocles from hanging over
us.''

<HEAD>Conoco Offers $23 Million to Settle Contamination Lawsuit</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PONCA CITY, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conoco Inc., in one of the biggest
settlements of its kind, has agreed to pay $23 million to buy 400
homes and compensate families who say its refinery is giving them
cancer and other illnesses.
   Under the settlement announced Monday with families who had sued
the company for allegedly contaminating the air and water, Conoco
would buy the properties for about $18 million and establish a $5
million compensation fund.
   Homeowner Mike Gallagher said his family was ready to move.
   ``The sooner, the better. Now we can go to the other side of
town. No more nosebleeds. No more headaches. We can live with
good-smelling air,'' he said.
   Under the settlement, Conoco, a subsidiary of the Du Pont Co.,
admits no liability.
   ``I would put that as one of the largest relocation settlements
in the country,'' Conoco attorney Mark Zehler said.
   Two comparable cases involved government money: the evacuation
of homes built atop tons of chemical waste at Love Canal in Niagara
Falls, N.Y., and the virtual abandonment in 1982 of Times Beach,
Mo., which was tainted by dioxin.
   The Love Canal buyout, in 1978, involved about $19 million to
purchase 232 homes. In Times Beach, about $33 million was spent to
buy 393 properties.
   Homeowners in the Circle Drive area of Ponca City had complained
since 1987 that groundwater laced with hydrocarbons, including
cancer-causing banzene, seeped into their basements and threatened
their health. Some residents camped out at the state Capitol for
weeks in 1988 to get the state to buy their houses.
   The protesters said heavy rain two years earlier had unleashed
toxic, reddish-orange sludge that bubbled up from cracks in
sidewalks, and black slime that oozed into their basements.
   Conoco said then the sludge was the result of iron ore, and the
state Health Department and federal Environmental Protection Agency
agreed there was no health hazard. But residents said they had
suffered an inordinate rate of cancer deaths and other ailments.
   Gallagher said his wife miscarried twice. Another baby was born
three months premature and weighed 2 pounds, 2 ounces. He lived a
week, Gallagher said. ``People ask why we didn't leave,'' he said.
``We couldn't afford it.''
   Refinery manager Dennis Parker said Conoco settled ``because it
is the right thing to do _ for these residents, for Ponca City and
for Conoco.''
   ``The situation has caused dissension in our community for too
long _ it's time to put it behind us,'' he said.
   Anna Sue Rafferty, who spoke on behalf of the plaintiffs,
declined to fix blame.
   ``To Conoco and Du Pont we say `thank you' in coming forth with
this settlement,'' Ms. Rafferty said. ``I'd just like to say none
of us is happy to be leaving our home. No one intended to get
rich.''
   A hearing on the settlement is set for June 5 in federal court
in Oklahoma City.
   If approved, the settlement of the lawsuit filed in March 1989
would enable many owners and renters of property to move. Residents
of a larger area of the neighborhood could receive payments because

   The dollar declined against other key currencies
except the British pound in European trading today. Gold was up.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 158.95 yen, down 1.00 yen from
Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar traded at 158.65 yen.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities
Co. in Tokyo , said market players avoided major moves before the
meeting among finance ministers from the Group of Seven
industrialized nations scheduled for April 7, and the conclusion of
the U.S.-Japan trade talks in Washington.
   Kanai said the dollar was likely to rise because market demand
for the currency remained strong. He said there was little
incentive to buy the yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.7024 West German marks, down from 1.7052;
1.5024 Swiss francs, down from 1.5068; 5.7175 French francs, down

   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose sharply
today in nervous, roller-coaster trading, and the dollar dropped
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained a hefty 757.65 points,
or 2.7 percent, ending the day at 28,757.65. In morning trading,
the index first rose more than 500 points, then fell below the
28,000-point line.
   The index rose again in the afternoon as participants decided
the market had bottomed out in the morning, said Yoshiro Inoue, an
analyst with Nomura Securities Co.
   He said market players expect the index will stay above the
27,200-point level, 30 percent below where it stood at the end of
last year.
   Inoue said another encouraging sign was the stability of
government bond prices, which remained relatively steady despite
Monday's heavy losses in the stock market.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 158.95 yen, down 1.00
yen from Monday's close of 159.95 yen. The U.S. currency opened at
159.10 yen and ranged between 158.80 yen and 159.35 yen.
   On Monday, as the dollar surged to a three-year high against the
Japanese yen, the Nikkei index plunged 1,978.38 points, or 6.59
percent, to close at 28,002.07, in its second-largest single-day
decline ever. The plunge followed a 1,045.71-point, or 3.37
percent, fall in the index last Friday.
   Analysts said both currency and stock markets were shaken Monday
by a report in a leading Japanese financial newspaper that major
life insurers planned to shift funds out of the stock market.
   Volume on the market's first section today was estimated at 650
million shares, up from 450 million shares on Monday.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bonds closed
at 86.44 points, up from Monday's close at 86.02. Their yield fell
to 7.260 percent from the previous day's 7.350 percent.
   But Inoue said uncertainty remained in the market. ``The index
has only entered a range that everybody predicted would be the
market's bottom, but there may be further shake-ups,'' Inoue said.
   Other traders said it would take time for the market to regain
its energy and make a stable recovery.
   ``As long as the government differentiates between interest
rates and the foreign exchange rate and takes two different
approaches, both markets will stabilize, and will help the stock
market recover,'' Inoue said.
   He said it would not be wise to raise interest rates in order to
support the yen.
   On March 25, the Bank of Japan raised its official discount rate
by 1 percentage point to 5.25 percent in a move widely seen as an
attempt to bolster the value of the dropping yen.
   Dealers said the Finance Ministry on Monday bought about 1
trillion yen ($6.3 billion) in government bonds to support their
price and prevent yields from rising excessively.
   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said today the
decline in Japanese stock prices since the beginning of this year
has been excessive.
   The Nikkei index has lost more than 10,000 points, or 26
percent, so far this year.
   Traders said currency market participants focused on the stock
market performance in the absence of other market-affecting news.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities
Co., said: ``The yen fell in the morning session as stock prices
fell, but the afternoon rebound in share prices did not boost
yen-buying incentives.''
   Kanai said market players avoided major moves before the meeting
among finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized
nations scheduled for April 7, and the conclusion of on-going
U.S.-Japan trade talks in Washington.
   But Kanai said the dollar was likely to continue to rise because
market demand for the U.S. currency remained strong, and there was
little incentive to buy the yen.
   He said that after the trade talks and the G-7 meeting,``the
dollar will jump over the 160-yen level and rise further.''
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said today he was concerned
by recent exchange rate movements, and hoped stability would return
to the market soon.

<HEAD>Leading Indicators Drop 1 Percent in February</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines pvs; no pickup.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge fell 1.0 percent in February, the Commerce Department
reported today, but analysts said it would have changed little
except for a drop in building permits.
   The Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to forecast
economic activity six to nine months in advance, had risen the
previous three months.
   But because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the index's
building permit component, many analysts expressed skepticism in
advance of the February report.
   The analysts said today's index would be lowered by the February
drop from the unusually large number of permits builders sought in
January to take advantage of record warm weather and to beat a
deadline for meeting expensive new building standards.
   The standards, required by 1989 fair housing legislation, are
designed to make apartment buildings more accessible to the
handicapped. The National Association of Home Builders said the
standards would add between $3,600 and $7,200 to the cost of an
apartment.
   According to a survey of 51 top economists published in Blue
Chip Economic Indicators, the gross national product _ the nation's
output of goods and services _ will grow 1.7 percent in 1990.
   But the survey by Eggert Economic Enterprises of Sedona, Ariz.,
says the economic outlook ``remains the most sluggish since the
recession year of 1982.''
   Seven of the 11 forward-looking statistics contributed to the
decline, led by the steep fall in building permits in February
after a sharp jump in the previous month _ the warmest January on
record.
   Other negatives included faster business delivery times, lower
stock prices, a decline in plant and equipment orders, a decrease
in the price of raw materials, a decline in the backlog of
manufacturers' unfilled orders and a drop in an index measuring
consumer confidence.
   Three of the components were positive, including an increase in
orders for consumer goods, a gain in the money supply and a drop in
weekly unemploylment claims.
   One indicator, the length of the average workweek, was unchanged.
   The various changes left the index at 144.0 percent of its 1982
base of 100. The index fell 0.6 percent from September through
February after declining 0.5 percent the previous six months.
   The January index was revised from unchanged to a 0.2 percent
gain because of an increase in new orders for consumer goods.
   The December index was revised down from 0.6 percent to 0.4
percent because of a shorter workweek. The November index had risen
0.1 percent.
   The analysts said because so many building permits were issued
in January, there were fewer issued in February, causing the number
to decline a sharp 25 percent. Economist Michael P. Niemira of
Mitsubishi Bank in New York said that drove the overall index down.
   If that one-time aberration were not included, the index might
have exceeded its January level, Niemira said.
   Michael K. Evans, head of a forecasting organization here, wrote
in the Evans Report shortly before the index was released that
``except for that one anomaly, the index (would) be up slightly.''
   ``Excluding the housing permits component, the index is expected
to stand unchanged, signifying continuation of restrained economic
growth,'' Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist for Fuji Securities Inc.
of Chicago, wrote in his organization's weekly Perspectives last
week.
   David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association, characterized the economy so far this year as ``a
quarter of recovery.''
   ``We recovered from the very cold December,'' Berson explained.
``We recovered from the Boeing strike, we recovered from the (San
Francisco Bay area) earthquake and the hurricane (Hugo) _ all of
which helped depress the fourth quarter.''

<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 2nd graf to make clear potential increase would be

<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork ribs for backyard barbecues are costing
more this spring, along with just about everything else that's part
of a hog.
   The Agriculture Department says hog farmers may increase
production seasonally later this year, but that won't do much to
cool off prices before this fall.
   Kevin Bost of the department's Economic Research Service said
last Friday's report showing further declines in the U.S. inventory
of hogs and pigs ``confirmed our expectations for reduced supplies
this spring and summer.''
   As a result, he said, ``we should be looking at higher wholesale
pork prices and higher retail prices'' in the next few months.
   The department's all-cut pork price _ a weighted blend of prices
paid by consumers at retail stores _ rose to $1.97 per pound in
February, Bost said Monday in a telephone interview. That matched
the all-time high set in the late summer of 1987.
   Bost said wholesale pork prices have continued to edge higher,
meaning that ``I wouldn't be surprised to see a new record high
retail price in March'' when the Labor Department releases those
consumer figures on April 17.
   In another report last Friday, the USDA showed the March
hog-corn feed price ratio at a relatively high 22.2 bushels, up
from 20.8 in February and 15.1 in March 1989.
   Those numbers represent the bushels of corn equal in value to
100 pounds of live hog shipped to market. Other factors are also
important in the hog business, but feed costs are a major item for
producers thinking about expanding or cutting back their operations.
   Roughly, the higher the number in the hog-corn ratio, the
greater the opportunity for profit.
   ``In general, returns to hog producers have been pretty
favorable since the middle part of last year,'' Bost said. ``If
(prices) go on good enough, for long enough, eventually they
expand.''
   One question is the corn crop and whether livestock producers
have ample feed supplies at reasonable prices. Bost said recent
moisture conditions ``sure doesn't hurt those prospects'' for the
1990 harvest.
   Based on the situation as it looks now, pork production probably
will begin to pick up at least seasonally this fall.
   ``We're probably looking at larger pork supplies in 1991,'' Bost
said.
   Meanwhile, Bost and his USDA colleagues say consumers may see
some easing of beef prices this summer, according to the April
issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. But it won't be dramatic.
   ``Improved prospects for spring grazing in some areas probably
will increase retention of females for (cattle) herd expansion and
lower slaughter of beef cows and heifers,'' the report said.
   As that happens, there will be less ``non-fed'' beef for
consumers, which affects hamburger prices.
   Prices of Choice-grade fed steers moving to slaughter ``will
continue to decline as market-ready supplies increase into early
summer,'' the report said. ``In some markets, prices may fall below
$70 per hundredweight, perhaps not reaching the mid-$70s again
until fall.''
   At retail, Choice-grade beef rose to a record level in January
of $2.813 per pound, on an all-cut basis and edged still higher to
$2.815 in February, the report said.
   Broiler prices have been supported by the strength in beef and
pork, with retail prices in the first quarter averaging about the
same as a year ago despite a production increase of about 8 percent
from year-earlier levels. Further increases are expected.
   In March, the estimated 12-city wholesale broiler price was
about 61 cents per pound, up from 57.37 cents in February and 51.7
cents in January. In March 1989, the 12-city average was 62.1 cents.
   ``The wholesale broiler prices in 1990 may average 51-57 cents
per pound, compared with 59 for last year,'' the report said.

   General Motors Corp. President Robert C. Stempel,
who today was named to succeed Roger B. Smith as GM chairman, rose
through the company's product ranks, a path decidedly different
from that of his predecessor.
   Stempel will take over operation of the world's largest
corporation Aug. 1, the day after Smith retires as GM's 10th
chairman and less than three weeks after Stempel turns 57.
   Stempel, a big man who peers directly at whomever he's talking
to, has been the company's president and chief operating officer
since Sept. 1, 1987. During months of speculation about Smith's
successor, Stempel was given the inside track.
   But that wasn't because his background mirrored Smith's. In auto
industry parlance, Stempel is a ``product guy'' and Smith is a
``bean counter.''
   Stempel received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering
from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts in 1955 and a
master's degree in business administration from Michigan State
University in 1970.
   Smith, GM's chairman since Jan. 1, 1981, received bachelor's and
master's degrees in business administration from the University of
Michigan. He joined GM as a senior accounting clerk in Detroit.
   Stempel joined GM as a senior detailer in the chassis design
department of the company's Oldsmobile Division in 1958, the same
year Smith became director of the general accounting section in the
Detroit central office.
   Each man climbed through the ranks in the 1960s, with Stempel
concentrating in powertrain design and Smith focusing on corporate
finances.
   In 1972, Stempel was named assistant chief engineer at
Oldsmobile and Smith was named vice president and group executive
in charge of the Nonautomotive and Defense Group.
   Stempel joined the legion of nearly four dozen GM vice
presidents when he became general manager of the company's Pontiac
Division in 1978, two years before going to Europe to head the
automaker's Adam Opel AG carmaking operation in West Germany.
   GM's European operations have produced profits that helped the
giant automaker last year regain the top profit spot it lost to
Ford Motor Co. in 1986.
   During the speculation about Smith's successor, auto analysts
said among the best things GM's board could do to slow or reverse
the company's slide in U.S. market share is elect someone who could
apply the lessons learned in Europe to the company's worldwide
operations.
   In 1982, Stempel returned to the United States to head the
Chevrolet Division, the company's largest carmaking operation. Two
years later, he was named executive in charge of the
Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group.
   In February 1986, Stempel joined Smith on GM's board of
directors as executive vice president in charge of the worldwide
Truck &amp; Bus Group and the Overseas Group.
   Nineteen months later, he became GM's 17th president.

   Analysts say the link between the Tokyo and New York markets is

interest-rate worries and a belief that stocks are overpriced
compared to earnings.

   A joint venture between Japanese and U.S. meat

   Sakai said it will be first time in Japan that beef is sold in
vending machines.
   Jackson Co., which has specialized in U.S. meat since 1978, and
Hamilton Meat Co., a meat packer based in San Diego, Calif., set up
the joint venture in Kobe last month, Sakai said.
   The new firm's move followed Japan's liberalization of imports
of seasoned beef into Japan on Sunday, the first day of the
country's new fiscal year, he said. Under a 1988 bilateral
agreement between Japan and the United States, Japan has been
gradually liberalizing beef imports.
   Under the venture, seasoned beef for steak and sukiyaki will be
processed in the United States before being imported in frozen
vacuum packages for sale in vending machines in Japan, Sakai said.
   Vending machines will be set up at 1,000 locations, mainly near
railway stations and convenience stores, Sakai said, adding that
the number of beef-selling machines will be increased to a yet
unspecified figure in the future.
   Sakai said the new joint company plans to sell a pack containing
17.5 ounces of beef for sukiyaki at about 1,800 yen, or $11.30,
about half the retail price of similar but locally produced beef.
   ``We can sell at that price by introducting vending machines in
place of the more costly workforce,'' Sakai said.
   Each vending machine will be connected to a computer at the
venture's head office which will monitor the temperature and manage
inventories within each freezer, he said.
   The company will install the vending machines starting next
week, and it is anticipating 3 billion yen, or $18.8 million, in
sales in its first year of operation, he said.
   Japan imported 128,000 tons of beef from the United States in
the first 10 months up to January of fiscal 1989, which accounted
for 41 percent of Japan's total beef imports in that period,
according to Japanese government figures.
   Hamilton Meat Co. is a subsidiary of Omaha, Nebraska-based Beef
America, a U.S. meat packer.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were higher in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with soybeans
rebounding weakly after a steep decline in the previous session.
   Soybean futures fell as much as 11\ cents a bushel Monday in
reaction to an Agriculture Department report that indicated U.S.
farmers intend to plant more soybeans and less corn than the market
had expected.
   Analysts said today's early rally reflected perceptions that
Monday's losses were overdone. Buying interest was limited, though,
by reports that the South American soybean harvest is rapidly
advancing and by improved soil moisture in the Midwest, where corn
and soybean planting gets underway this month.
   ``In the next 10 days they'll start cranking up,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Corn futures drew support from signs of increased export
activity while wheat futures gained on forecasts for cold weather
in winter wheat country.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 2} cents higher
with May at $3.58{ a bushel; corn was { cent to 1\ cents higher
with May at $2.64 a bushel; oats were { cent to } cent higher with
May at $1.52 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 2{ cents higher
with May at $5.87 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange following sharp gains Monday in the hog
and pork-belly markets.
   Live cattle futures were .08 cent to .17 cent higher with April
at 78.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .23

unchanged to .40 cent higher with April at 54.50 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .60 cent to .75 cent higher with May at

   General Motors Corp. president and chief
operating officer Robert C. Stempel, who rose through the
production ranks of the world's largest automaker, was named today
to succeed the retiring Roger B. Smith as chairman.
   Smith, who officially steps down July 31 at age 65, announced
Stempel's selection at a news conference at GM headquarters.
   Lloyd E. Reuss, a GM executive vice president, will succeed
Stempel as president, Smith said. The position of chief operating
officer, also held by Stempel, was being eliminated.
   Stempel told reporters at the news conference his first priority
is increasing GM sales.
   ``One of our major ones (challenges) ... is to increase our
North American market share profitably,'' Stempel said. ``There is
no higher priority in General Motors than increasing our market
share profitably.''
   GM's share of the North American car and truck market has
dropped to 34.6 percent last year from 44.1 percent in 1980.
   GM's board of directors met Monday at the company's sprawling
car- and truck-making complex in Oshawa, Ontario.
   A team of outside directors has been serving as a search
committee for the chairman of the company that last year made $4.22
billion on revenue of $126.9 billion.
   Smith, who said he would remain on GM's board, praised Stempel
for his domestic and international experience.
   ``I'm leaving General Motors on August 1 convinced we've got
probably the greatest team we've ever had, because we've got some
of the greatest challenges we've ever had,'' the outgoing chairman
said.
   Most speculation in recent months has centered on the
56-year-old Stempel, although the names of two GM executive vice
presidents, F. Alan Smith and John F. Smith Jr., also have been
mentioned as candidates for chairman. Both Smiths, no relation to
Roger Smith, had financial backgrounds.
   Stempel began his GM career as a senior detailer in the chassis
design department of the company's Oldsmobile Division in 1958.
   He became general manager of the company's Pontiac Division in
1978, and two years later went to Europe to head GM's Adam Opel AG
carmaking operation in West Germany.
   In 1982, Stempel returned to the United States to head the
Chevrolet Division and in 1984 was named executive in charge of the
Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group.
   In February 1986, Stempel joined GM's board of directors as
executive vice president in charge of the worldwide Truck &amp; Bus
Group and the Overseas Group.
   The following year, he became GM's president.
   Reuss, 53, has been executive vice president in charge of North
American Passenger Car Groups and a board member since February
1986. He was given the additional responsibility of GM's truck and
bus grup in 1987. He started as a GM engineer in 1959.
   GM is the second of the Big Three U.S. automakers to revamp its
top management for the 1990s.
   On March 1 Harold Poling became Ford Motor Co.'s chairman,
succeeding Donald Petersen. Poling will hold the top job at Ford
for three years before he is expected to give way to Allan Gilmour,
executive vice president.
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca's contract with the nation's
No. 3 automaker expires late next year.
   GM has been wrestling with excess plant capacity as the U.S.
auto market softens. The huge automaker is expected to shutter its
Lakewood car assembly plant in Atlanta this summer and half of its
Lordstown, Ohio, plant next year.
   Since 1987, GM has shut down assembly plants in Framingham,
Mass.; Kansas City, Mo.; and Pontiac, Mich.
   Balancing plant capacity with a shrinking car and truck market
is one of the big challenges facing the new GM chairman.
   Others include managing the launch and growth of GM's Saturn
Corp., which plans to begin making a small, import-fighting car
this summer in Spring Hill, Tenn., and contract negotiations with
the United Auto Workers union, which has tapped job security as its
top bargaining priority.
   The Saturn project, originally proposed in 1983 as a $5-billion
program to build 500,000 subcompacts a year, has been cut nearly in
half. Yet with its unique labor agreement and manufacturing
techniques, it is viewed as a laboratory of things to come at GM
and a key step in the automaker's attempt to arrest a decline in
its market share.
   Smith repeatedly has vowed to drive the first production car off
the assembly line, now scheduled for about a month before his
retirement.
   But overshadowing all the new product projects are GM's labor
relations with the UAW. Since the last three-year contract was
signed in 1987, thousands of GM's union workers have lost jobs and
watched factories fall idle.
   There is speculation the UAW will select GM as its target
company after talks start this July, meaning the union will focus
its negotiating attention on that automaker. The UAW's contracts
with GM, Ford and Chrysler expire Sept. 14.

<HEAD>Japan's Auto Sales Reach Record 5.8 Million in Fiscal 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of passenger cars, trucks and buses in Japan
rose by 17.4 percent in fiscal 1989 to a record 5.8 million, the
Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said Tuesday.
   It was the first time that annual sales have surpassed 5
million, and the third year in a row that new sales records have
been set.
   An association official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
attributed the sales increase to the expansion of Japan's domestic
economy, strong personal consumption spending and the introduction
of new models.
   Sales also were boosted by the removal of higher commodity taxes
on cars last April when a general 3 percent consumption tax went
into effect, the official said.
   He said sales of passenger cars rose 22.4 percent to 4.3
million, trucks rose 5.9 percent to 1.5 million, and buses fell 7.8
percent to 22,792, all compared with fiscal 1988. Japan's fiscal
year ends March 31.
   Sales of imported cars rose by 42.5 percent from a year earlier
to 203,010, the official said.
   He said Toyota Motor Corp. topped the list of auto sales, with
2.4 million passenger cars, trucks and buses, up 16.2 percent from
fiscal 1988.
   Nissan Motor Co., was second with 1.4 million vehicles, up 18.1
percent, followed by Mazda Motor Corp. with 486,636, up 29.9
percent, and Honda Motor Co., with 463,526, up 21.5 percent, the
official said.

   Stock prices advanced broadly today, boosted by
a rebound in the Tokyo market and firm bond prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 22.30 to 2,722.75
as of noon EDT.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in the early
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 873 up, 408
down and 525 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 69.53 million shares as of noon
on Wall Street.
   In Japan, prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped sharply in
nervous, roller-coaster trading. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
gained 757.65 points, or 2.7 percent, ending the day's session at
28,757.65.
   On Monday, Tokyo stock prices plummeted 6.6 percent in their
second-worst fall this year. The selloff initially spilled over to
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones average slipped as much as 30
points in early trading before firming to close 6.76 points lower
at 2,700.45.
   Analysts say the link between the Tokyo and New York markets is
not as strong as once believed. They also say most of the trouble
on the Japanese exchange is due to domestic concerns, including
interest-rate worries and a belief that stocks are overpriced
compared to earnings.
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.,
said the market today was encouraged by three factors: its rebound
Monday, the firming in Tokyo prices and a stable bond market.
Treasury bonds were unchanged to &lsqb; point higher this morning.
   Johnson said the recovery Monday in New York suggests ``that our
markets continue to manage the declines in Tokyo pretty easily.
   Among actively traded blue-chip issues today, Philip Morris rose
} to 40\, Eastman Kodak rose 1&rsqb; to 40&rsqb; and IBM was up { to 106&rsqb;.
   Among other active issues, Unocal dropped 1&lsqb; to 32{ after a
Merrill Lynch analyst lowered his earnings forecast for the oil
company. Unocal has been the subject of takeover rumors in recent
days.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.45 to 187.53. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.61 to 360.98.

<HEAD>Reassurance On Trade Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least one aspect of trade talks between the
United States and Japan is reassuring. In some respects, that is,
each nation proposes moves that conceivably could help the other.
   Why should there be resistance over that? Maybe there shouldn't
be, but there is. Trade talks, like all inter-nation discussions,
become mixed up in politics, not to mention diplomatic nuances.
   The Japanese would like to see Americans cut the budget deficit,
save more, raise the skills and overall abilities of workers, put
more effort into long-term research and, in general, improve the
quality of products.
   Media reports suggest other, maybe more controversial, proposals
have been made, including a reduction in credit cards, lower
corporate bonuses and higher gasoline taxes, all ideas with support
within the United States.
   For its part, the United States would like to see the Japanese
improve their living standards, allow greater consumer access to
supermarkets and department stores, pay lower prices and improve
their infrastructure.
   There are, of course, many controversial aspects to the trade
talks, but these relatively beneficent issues are among them. And
all have support within the respective countries.
   From President Bush on down, it would seem that most Americans
would be happy with a smaller budget deficit. The only major
controversy appears to be the method by which it is achieved.
   Proposals to raise the level of U.S. education and skills are
discussed every day in the United States, and a researcher would be
hard pressed to find anyone with a strong negative view on the
matter.
   Within the United States there has been repeated criticism of
the tendency of some corporate managers to take the short-term
view, with many of the critics maintaining that the short-term view
weakens America competitively.
   It didn't take criticism by the Japanese to awaken Americans to
an allegedly low savings rate. Almost everyone agrees that savings
are good for individuals, businesses and country.
   On these, many Japanese and Americans see eye to eye.
   On the other side of the discussion, it is unlikely you would
find many Japanese opposed to better living standards. Japan is
rich, the world's No. 2 economic power, but many of its citizens
don't know it.
   Many Americans are not familiar with the way the Japanese live.
Roger A. Brooks, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank, is familiar.
   In a position paper for the foundation's Asian Studies Center,
of which he is director, Brooks urges the Japanese to say ``yes''
to opening their markets to imports. And for reasons with which
many Japanese might agree.
   To wit:
   ``In the absence of imports, Japan forces its consumers to pay
eight times what Americans pay for rice; to live in houses that are
on average one-third the size of U.S. homes; to pay three times the
world price for fiber-optic cable for Japan's telephone
modernization efforts; to buy their goods at `Mom and Pop'
operations with huge markups because of the law, changed only
recently, outlawing discount stores.''
   His portrait isn't complete.
   Japan, he says, has the world's largest surplus of foreign
exchange, but it also has ``the greatest proportion of unpaved
roads in the developed world,'' and the lowest per capita endowment
of public facilities such as parks and sporting areas.
   Among the highly industrialized nations, he says, Japan has
``surely the least materially bountiful life.''
   Reports from trade negotiations suggest a reluctance by each
nation to make concessions, interspersed with occasional
breakthroughs. In all, the tone has been less than highly positive.
   But, with these cross-table suggestions for improvements there
seems to be at least a basis in good will for an agreement this
month. That much is reassuring.

   The dollar was modestly weaker against major
currencies in European trading Tuesday, moving in previously

   Gold gained against the dollar.
   The dollar rebounded modestly from overnight losses but remained
under some pressure as buyers took a more cautious approach to the
U.S. currency ahead of talks this weekend among the Group of Seven
industrial nations.
   Although dealers said the dollar is supported by worries over
German unification and questions over the ability of Japan to
support the sagging yen, they said that those factors did not
provoke fresh dollar buying.
   ``Most of what we saw to day was purely intraday,'' said a
senior corporate dealer at a large French bank. ``I don't think

from Monday's close. In London, the dollar traded at 159.10 yen.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Monday's prices,

   The Department of Justice is investigating an
electronic flight control system for the B-2 stealth bomber built
by Northrop Corp., the military contractor disclosed in its annual
report.
   The system, called the Actuator Remote Terminal, helps keep the
B-2 stable in flight by relaying information between the plane's
flight control computer and flight control surfaces.
   Northrop disclosed the Justice Department investigation Monday.
   It said its recent guilty plea to unrelated criminal charges
provided for the government to drop certain investigations at the
company, but not the one into the ART.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that the ART has been
plagued by severe technical problems. The Air Force has been
upgrading it while the B-2 has been grounded for modifications
since late last year.
   When flight tests resume later this month, the next step will be
testing of the aircraft's ability to evade radar.

   U.S. and Japanese negotiators resumed
discussions today on one of the thorniest trade disputes between
the two nations _ an effort to attack the underlying causes of
America's $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   Both sides reported good progress had been made after the first
day of talks Monday behind closed doors at the State Department.
   However, the head of a major manufacturers' lobbying group today
raised questions over whether the U.S. side was demanding enough
concessions from the Japanese to lower America's trade deficit by
any significant degree.
   ``I think it is still up in the air whether these talks will
yield any meaningful results,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, president of
the National Association of Manufacturers.
   The Bush administration launched the talks, known as the
Structural Impediments Initiative, last July, seeking to force the
Japanese to remove barriers that prevent the sale of American
products and services in Japan.
   The administration is demanding a halt to cozy Japanese business
practices that exclude foreign companies, as well as tougher
enforcement of laws prohibiting bid-rigging and price-fixing.
   stration official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told
reporters the Japanese initiatives were designed to ward off
protectionist pressures in America and to benefit Japan.
   ``This is not being done for the sake of pleasing others, but to
improve the quality of life for Japanese consumers,'' Watanabe said.
   He refused to discuss details of the Japanese package. However,
published reports said Japanese negotiators proposed, among other
things, making it easier for large American retailers to open
stores in Japan.
   The Japanese negotiators also reportedly proposed increased
penalties for violations of anti-monopoly laws and laid out plans
for increased spending on public works projects, two demands of
U.S. negotiators.
   Watanabe said the Japanese actions were not being taken under
threat of U.S. retaliation, but he said the Japanese side felt it
was important to show it had made the ``utmost effort'' to resolve
the disputes.
   The administration is reviewing barriers against U.S. products
with a congressionally imposed April 30 deadline to target
countries with the most onerous barriers for intensive negotiations.
   Last year the Japanese were targeted for barriers against the
sale of U.S. supercomputers, satellites and wood products. In
recent days, negotiators have reached agreements in principle to
resolve the satellite and supercomputer issues and will meet later
this month in an effort to expand the Japanese market for American
lumber.

   At least five shots struck a
Southeastern Trailways bus today as it traveled along a Greyhound
route from Nashville to Louisville, state police said.
   Neither the driver nor the only passenger aboard was injured.
The incident happened just two days after another Southeastern
Trailways bus on a route usually traveled by strike-plagued
Greyhound was hit and the driver seriously wounded.
   Kentucky State Police Trooper Eddie Lair said today's shooting
was reported about 10:15 a.m. EDT and occurred somewhere on
Interstate 65 near Sonora, about 55 miles south of Louisville.
   All five shots hit the bus on the driver's side, but none of
them penetrated, he said. The driver, who was not identified, could
not say from which direction the shots were fired, Lair said.
   Officials believe a .22-caliber rifle was used.
   On Saturday, Southeastern Trailways driver David E. Bryant was
wounded in the arm by a shot fired from a pickup that pulled
alongside. As in today's shooting, the Southeastern Trailways bus
was following a Greyhound route under a pool arrangement.
   Bryant, 58, of Cincinnati was reported in fair condition today
at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. A hospital
spokesman, Jim Keeley, said fears that Bryant's badly wounded arm
would have to be amputated had eased.
   None of Bryant's 46 passengers was wounded.
   There have been reports of sporadic violence and other shootings
since Greyhound drivers went on strike March 2. The company blames
the union and says there will be no contract talks until a week
goes by with no violence.
   On Monday, the head of Greyhound's drivers union suggested the
company's refusal to negotiate is partly to blame for the violence.
   ``Reaching an agreement through bargaining would leave the
`crazies' without any incentive to violence,'' union president
Edward Strait said Monday in a letter to Greyhound Executive Vice
President P. Anthony Lannie.
   Talks were to have resumed Monday until the company called them
off in the wake of continuing violence.
   Lannie dismissed as ``total nonsense'' any suggestion that
America's only nationwide bus system is reponsible for violence by
refusing to negotiate.
   The walkout by 6,300 drivers and some 3,000 office and
maintenance workers began over wages and job security March 2. On
Monday, Greyhound said there had been 29 shootings, including 24 in
which buses were the target.
   The union says there have been more than 60 incidents of
violence against pickets.
   As of Monday, the company said it had 1,519 permanent
replacements behind the wheel, plus 480 union members who crossed
picket lines.
   Lannie said the company anticipates having 3,200 drivers at work
by Easter, the busiest travel period of the first quarter.

   London's Traded Options Market, a subsidiary of
London's Stock Exchange, and the London International Financial
Futures Exchange said Tuesday they were exploring a merger.
   ``The aim is to combine the two markets under a single
autonomous management and governance on a single trading floor,''
the two markets said in a statement.
   The aim is to create a more efficient market structure and
enhance the London securities market, the statement said.
   A group made up of prominent members of London's financial
community has been set up to investigate the best way to fully
integrate the two markets, they said.
   The group should give an interim progress report by the end of
April, with definitive proposals on the link-up expected by the end
of June, the markets said.

<HEAD>Panasonic Announces First Erasable Optical Storage for Video Use</HEAD>

   The first commercially available optical disc
recorder that can erase stored images and record over them will
give broadcasters a better tool than videotape for showing video
replays, Panasonic said.
   The new device would allow television stations to more easily
replay a sports highlight, for example, than conventional videotape
technology, the Japanese company said Monday. It also can store
more minutes of video and provides better picture quality than
videotape.
   The recorder can find an individual frame of recorded video
within one second, the company said. That's much quicker than
videotape machines, in which the tape must be rewound to the exact
spot.
   Panasonic also said the machine could be used for interactive
training programs, to store criminal records in police departments,
and for sales and marketing uses, such as recording videotapes of
homes to show to prospective buyers.
   Eventually, similar devices could be made for home use, said
Edward Rothchild, a San Francisco-based consultant on optical
storage devices. He calls such recordable laser video disc players
``the next mass consumer products,'' which could supplant VCRs and
videotapes much as compact discs are replacing phonograph records.
   The current generation of home laser video disc machines can
only play prerecorded discs. They have failed to become a major
market in part because they cannot record TV shows.
   Optical storage devices have been around for years, but most of
them cannot be erased once the original recording is made. They are
used primarily for long-term storage of computer data, such as
invoices or bank statements.
   Panasonic's device works on the magneto-optical principal, in
which a magnetic field is used to magnetize certain portions of the
optical disc. A laser beam ``reads'' these magnetized portions and
converts them into a picture. Unlike a compact disc, it stores the
information in conventional analog form instead of in the computer
language of digital storage.
   Jay Bretzmann, an analyst for International Data Corp., said the
device's major advantage over videotape is its ease of locating
certain portions of stored video. He also said it could be reused
many more times than videotape, which tends to degrade in quality
over time.
   ``I think it will expand the market for these devices,'' he said.
   He said Panasonic is leveraging the expertise of its parent,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan, in optical storage
devices.
   Rothchild said other Japanese companies have demonstrated
similar machines but that Panasonic is the first to the market.
   In addition to their appeal to TV stations, he said, they also
should prove popular with movie studios, which already are using
non-erasable optical discs to edit film. Erasable discs would be a
great cost-savings, he said.
   Panasonic did not disclose the price of the recorder. It plans
to begin shipments in the fourth quarter.

   Stock prices advanced broadly today, boosted by
a rebound in the Tokyo market and firm bond prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 23.65 to 2,724.10
as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 among New York
Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 954 up, 425 down and 522
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 101.94 million shares with two
hours of trading remaining.
   In Japan, prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped sharply in
nervous, roller-coaster trading. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
gained 757.65 points, or 2.7 percent, ending the day's session at
28,757.65.
   On Monday, Tokyo stock prices plummeted 6.6 percent in their
second-worst fall this year. The selloff initially spilled over to
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones average slipped as much as 30
points in early trading before firming to close 6.76 points lower
at 2,700.45.
   Analysts say the link between the Tokyo and New York markets is
not as strong as once believed. They also say most of the trouble
on the Japanese exchange is due to domestic concerns, including
interest-rate worries and a belief that stocks are overpriced
compared to earnings.
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.,
said the U.S. market today was encouraged by three factors: its
rebound Monday, the firming in Tokyo prices and a stable bond
market. Treasury bond prices were mixed in a narrow range today.
   Johnson said the recovery Monday in New York suggests ``that our
markets continue to manage the declines in Tokyo pretty easily.''
   Among actively traded blue-chip issues today, Philip Morris rose
| to 40&lsqb;, Eastman Kodak rose 1\ to 40\, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph was up &lsqb; at 41} and IBM was up { to 106&rsqb;.
   Among other active issues, Unocal dropped 1} to 31~ after
negative analyst comments. A Merrill Lynch analyst lowered his
earnings forecast for the oil company and others said they were
less bullish on the stock. Unocal has been the subject of takeover
rumors in recent days.

<HEAD>Simmons Won't Pursue Georgia Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Harold Simmons has ended his $1.1 billion
tender offer for Georgia Gulf Corp., deciding instead to back the
chemical company's recapitalization plan at its April 19 annual
meeting.
   However, Simmons' NL Industries Inc., which owns almost 10
percent of Georgia Gulf's stock, left open Monday the possibility
of another tender offer if shareholders reject the recapitalization
plan.
   In January, Georgia Gulf, which is based in Atlanta, proposed
the debt-financed recapitalization to boost the price of its stock
and fend off an earlier offer from Simmons.
   Simmons countered with another tender offer in a move analysts
said was designed to pressure Georgia Gulf to complete the
recapitalization as proposed.
   Since Georgia Gulf amended its original plan two weeks ago, its
stock has traded close to the $45 a share offered by Simmons. In a
statement, NL Industries said it was not willing to increase its
bid at this time and would instead support the Georgia Gulf plan.
   NL said it was also ending a planned proxy fight for control of
Georgia Gulf's board.
   Georgia Gulf stock was trading at $43.87{ a share on the New
York Stock Exchange Tuesday.
   Georgia Gulf has promised shareholders $30 a share in cash plus
$8.50 a share in notes, and stock the company has valued at $11 a
share. The original proposal promised stock and $38 a share in
cash, but analysts were concerned that the company would be unable
to sell the $200 million in junk bonds needed to finance the offer.
   ``While they are offering less cash, it is a more doable
transaction,'' said Michael Snetzer, a Simmons strategist.
   If shareholders approve Georgia Gulf's recapitalization plan, NL
could walk away from its investment with about $15 million in
profits based on a $45-a-share value for the proposal.
   If shareholders do not approve the plan, NL said it might
consider another tender offer for the company.

Changes</HEAD>

   Pessimism about the economy and outcome of trade
talks with the United States have helped spur the protracted slide
in Japan's stock market, analysts said Tuesday.
   Traders said many investors are concerned the the trade
negotiations in Washington could affect the structural causes of
Japan's $49 billion trade surplus with the United States and lead
to wrenching changes in an export-oriented economy that is largely
responsible for the nation's stunning growth.
   In the talks, called the Structural Impediments Initiative, the
United States has pressured Japan to boost public works spending,
simplify its complex distribution system, ease the way for large
retailers to open stores, and tighten enforcement of its
Anti-Monopoly Law.
   ``Japan will have to make a series of changes in the structural
talks, and will have to forget about the old structures that
supported our stock market boom and the strong yen in the past,''
said Kenji Maeshiro, a stock analyst with Yamaichi Securities Co.
   ``What we need now is to have a new approach to stock investment
in order to cope with the new economic structures and policies,''
he said.
   So far this year, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei Stock
Average has fallen more than 10,000 points, or 26 percent, from a
record 38,915.78 at the end of 1989.
   The market's total value also has dropped quickly _ at the close
of trading on Tuesday, it stood at 456.8 trillion yen or $2.87
trillion, down from 611.15 trillion yen or $3.84 trillion at the
end of last year.
   The recent string of stock market plunges was topped by Monday's
drop of 1,978.38 points, or 6.59 percent, in the Nikkei's
second-largest single-day dive ever, as the dollar surged to a
three-year high against the yen.
   The only larger single-day loss was during the Black Monday
global stock crash on Oct. 20, 1987, when the Nikkei shed 3,836.48
points, or 14.9 percent, to close at 21,910.08.
   As the market has continued its steep declines, securities
dealers and analysts have repeatedly lowered their predictions for
the Nikkei's bottom, with most estimates now near the 27,000-level.
   Following the 757.65-point or 2.7 percent rebound Tuesday,
traders' predictions were divided. Some said the market had
bottomed out, while others said market nervousness and pessimism
would persist in coming weeks.
   Josen Takahashi, chief economist at the Mitsubishi Research
Institute, said the market plunges reflected fear of higher
inflation in Japan.
   Due partly to the yen's weakness, wholesale prices rose a
relatively high 3.8 percent in the second 10 days of March from a
year earlier. In another sign of the declining currency, Japan
reported a $4.907 billion overall trade surplus in February, down
32.4 percent from a year earlier.
   Takahashi said inflationary pressures began forming last year,
when market participants disregarded rising short-term interest
rates and continued to push up stock prices. Ordinarily, when
interest rates rise, stocks fall.
   The Bank of Japan plunged in by boosting its key official
discount rate three times, from 2.5 percent to 4.25 percent,
followed by an additional 1 percentage point hike on March 25 this
year to 5.25 percent. The objective was to discourage borrowing,
cool inflation and stabilize the yen.
   Market players had expected the most recent discount-rate
increase to come shortly after parliamentary elections on Feb. 18,
and blamed the extended delay with further destabilizing stock
prices and the yen.
   Despite its recent heavy market intervention, the Bank of Japan,
the nation's central bank, has failed to halt the yen's decline.
   Because of the intervention, Japan's foreign currency and gold
reserves suffered the largest fall ever in March, dropping $6.947
billion to $73.496 billion, the Finance Ministry reported Monday.
The tumble was the third consecutive monthly decline.
   Takahashi said stocks will continue to fall unless underlying
problems _ a mix of higher interest rates, the weaker yen and
higher consumer prices _ show signs of improvement.
   The yen is unlikely to strengthen under Japan's current
political and economic conditions, he said.
   ``Japan has became more isolated and its relative importance has
declined as hopes about reforms in Eastern Europe and uncertainties
over the U.S.-Japan trade talks have grown,'' he said.
   A leading Japanese economic newspaper, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun,
called Tuesday on political leaders to take action to improve the
economic climate.
   ``Unless Japan's political world can satisfy the markets in
reforming the country's structural problems, there will be no
chance of the yen's recovery, and no bottom for the stock market,''
it said.

   Japan's leading banks, which bumped U.S.
competitors from the world's top 10 list in the 1980s, are finding
themselves squeezed by higher costs, reduced business and the Tokyo
stock market's slide.
   ``The advantage Japanese banks used to enjoy has been largely
eradicated. ... The whole perspective of international banking is
considerably changed,'' said David Threadgold, an analyst with
County NatWest Securities.
   Paul Heaton, senior analyst at W.I. Carr Securities, predicts
that profits at the 13 leading commercial banks dropped 11 percent
for the fiscal year ended March 31. In the previous year, profits
rose 25 percent.
   Leaving out income from equities sales, earnings from banking
business may be down by 50 percent from fiscal 1988, Threadgold
said.
   In addition, the fall of the yen and Japan's stock market have
imperiled the banks' plans to raise their capital levels to meet
international standards set for 1993.
   ``Management at top banks feel we have entered a very difficult
period. But we are not going to see any bankruptcies,'' said
Teruyuki Takahashi, a senior manager at the Japanese Federation of
Bankers' Associations.
   The world's 10 biggest banks in assets are Japanese. Sheer size
will keep them there, but they will become weaker competitors
abroad as their source of cheap funds dries up, Threadgold said.
   Rising interest rates have made it more expensive for banks to
acquire funds for lending. Banks now are paying holders of money
market certificates 5.8 percent interest, compared with the 0.75
percent paid on ordinary bank accounts.
   Furthermore, more customers now can buy money market
certificates because the minimum purchase has been cut from $62,500
to $6,250.
   Meanwhile, business from income-producing loans has been chilled
by higher interest rates and by government efforts to cool the
feverish property market.
   Japan's central bank has raised its key rate for loans to
commercial banks from 2.5 percent to 5.25 percent in the past 10
months. In turn, commercial banks' prime lending rates jumped from
about 5.5 percent to around 7.2 percent.
   ``The speed of change is too fast,'' Takahashi said.
   At the same time, the Bank of Japan has instructed banks to keep
property loan growth in line with the industry's overall loan
growth, instead of their recent pace of double the overall rate.
The move is aimed at helping cool property prices that have jumped
50 percent to 90 percent annually in Tokyo and other major cities
since the mid-1980s.
   Banks have been dealt a double blow by the rapid change: they
are paying higher rates on customer certificates but are earning
relatively low interest on long-term past loans. Anticipating
higher rates, many companies rushed to take out long-term loans
over the past year, Heaton said.
   Furthermore, loan volume is slumping, said Yoshiaki Takanashi,
chief of research at Yasuda Trust Bank. Businesses are raising more
of their funds from other sources or simply putting off capital
spending, he said.
   Heaton said loan growth, which had been expanding at 12 percent
to 14 percent a year, now was less than 10 percent.
   Meanwhile, the rapid fall of the yen and the stock market has
hurt the banks' attempt to meet international capital adequacy
standards, said Takanashi, at Yasuda Trust.
   Major economic powers, acting through the Swiss-based Bank for
International Settlements, have set a March 1993 deadline for banks
to hold capital equal to at least 8 percent of their loans and
other assets. Japanese banks used to maintain only about half that
and have been relying heavily on the equities market to raise the
needed capital through new share and covertible bond offerings.
   The stock market's more than 25 percent loss this year has
drained the value of banks' shareholdings and made it difficult to
raise new capital in the market, Takanashi said.
   Additionally, the yen's fall of about 10 percent against the
U.S. dollar this year has raised the value of dollar-denominated
loans overseas, he said. These inflated loan values, comprising
roughly 40 percent of the city banks' assets, require more capital
in reserve.

   The world's two most powerful economies have
become inextricably wedded. But too often the relationship between
the United States and Japan seems like a bad marriage characterized
by frequent spats. What do the two have in common apart from money?

   Never mind trade tensions. At Sam Kusumoto's
company, a recent office party was enough to put a crimp in
U.S.-Japan relations.
   There wasn't an argument or even a minor contretemps at the
affair. Many of the American employees just didn't show up. It
seems they didn't know about it in time, explains Kusumoto,
president of Minolta USA in suburban Ramsey, N.J.
   ``At Japanese companies, we have very nice horizontal
communication,'' he says. ``Everybody listens to what the other guy
is talking about over the phone. After office hours we associate.''
   So plans for just about everything spread chattily through the
ranks _ in Japanese, of course. Formal notice, American-style, is
almost an afterthought.
   ``The Americans didn't hear about the party,'' Kusumoto says.
``And when they discovered the date was decided months ago they got
upset.''
   A simple miscue, but behind it lay a gulf of misunderstanding
that somehow has defied nearly 50 years of U.S.-Japan amity and
more than a century of cultural exchange since 19th century Japan,
under American prodding, cast off its feudal kosode (robes).
   Today more than ever, the world's two most powerful economies
have become inextricably wedded. But too often the relationship
seems like a bad marriage characterized by frequent squabbles and
little in common apart from money.
   The tensions have appeared in numerous forms, despite the best
efforts of both sides to avoid them: in charges of discrimination
by American employees of Japanese companies, in a hardhearted new
appraisal by Washington of its one-time protege, and vice versa.
And not least, in an undercurrent of racism.
   The racism often surfaces subtly. When Japanese companies
purchasedsuch American corporate icons as Columbia Pictures and New
York's Rockefeller Center last year, the headlines often read ``The
Japanese Buy ...,'' as if the entire nation were bent,
samurai-like, on the takeover.
   In contrast, other major foreign purchasers _ British, Canadian,
Dutch _have been described more accurately as individual companies.
   Part of it is the sheer cultural impact of Japan's new wealth,
an economic sea change that made Japan the world's largest creditor
by the end of the 1980s, and its former patron, the United States,
the largest debtor.
   ``It's the Japanese rate of buying that's frightening,'' says
Marlene Rossman, a New York-based consultant to New York companies.
   Japan is now second only to Great Britain in U.S. investments.
From May 1987 to last May, the number of U.S. factories with at
least partial Japanese ownership nearly doubled from 550 to 1,043,
according to the Japan External Trade Organization.
   Japan's total investment in U.S. real estate, corporations and
subsidiaries soared from $4.7 billion in 1980 to $53.4 billion in
1988, according to the most recent Commerce Department figures.
Japanese companies now hold about 50 percent of the commercial real
estate in downtown Los Angeles, more than 20 prime properties in
Manhattan, including Tiffany's, and substantial holdings in
Washington.
   It is not over the issue of Washington real estate, however, but
closer to the heart of the nation's capital that U.S.-Japanese
tensions have perhaps cut deepest.
   Particularly irksome were the 1989 trade figures released in
February. The United States enjoyed a $1.5 billion surplus with the
12-nation European Community, a sharp turnaround from a $9.2
billion deficit in 1988. But with Japan, despite a sharp decline in
the dollar engineered to help U.S. exports, the deficit was a
stubborn $49 billion.
   That was no appreciable improvement from the previous year's
$51.8 billion deficit with Japan, even with an 18 percent increase
in U.S. export sales, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary for
international trade in the Commerce Department.
   The trade frictions are aggravated by what many in Congress and
the Bush administration see as the Japanese government's xenophobic
resistance to open markets and cultural disposition to treat trade
as economic warfare.
   ``The fallacy in asking the Japanese to open their markets is
they haven't got the foggiest idea what an open market is,'' says
Clyde Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department negotiator whose
influential 1988 book, ``Trading Places,'' portrayed Japan as
having carefully planned its export-fueled ascendancy.
   In Tokyo, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said U.S.
analysts were wrong in arguing that Japan's culture was an
unchangeable barrier to concepts like an open market. On March 22,
U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators reported a breakthrough over
the key issue of opening supercomputer exports to Japan.
   In addition, experts point out, Japan has been moving from an
export-based to a domestic market-based economy.
   Japan has a long history of adapting foreign ideas, Watanabe
said, ``and there is no reason why we cannot continue to do so.''
   One reason, however, is that the Japanese are not as keen on
foreign ideas these days, an attitude born of Japan's pride in its
postwar ``miracle'' and a growing contempt for the United States'
persistent problems.

   According to a Business Week poll released Dec. 7 _ Pearl Harbor
Day _ more than half of the Japanese don't have much or any
admiration for the United States, its economic success or its
people.
   A recent book published in Japanese, ``A Japan That Can Say
No,'' stunned Washington when word trickled back of its harsh view
of the United States. But in Japan it has ruffled few feathers
because much of its content ``has been expressed privately by
(Japanese) journalists and businessmen who deal with America,''
Taro Kimura, a former anchorman for Japan Broadcasting Corp.,
commented in a newspaper column.
   One of the book's authors, Shintaro Ishihara, a right-wing
former Cabinet minister, went beyond the usual criticisms of U.S.
corporate shortsightedness and product quality. He wrote that
racial prejudice is at the base of U.S.-Japan frictions. American
whites, realizing their culture is declining, fear losing
leadership to the ``yellow-race Japanese,'' he said.
   But Ishihara's outspokenness still represents an extreme. The
irony of U.S.-Japan frictions is that both sides _ the Japanese in
particular _ seem to try so hard to avoid misunderstanding.
   Many Americans _ even President Bush _ say they welcome Japanese
investment here. And no one denies that many Japanese are still
more mad for the West than mad at it. Japanese companies still pay
out monstrous fees for endorsements by such American celebrities as
Michael Jackson (who are rarely if ever seen in U.S. ads). Most
Japanese cigarettes and many other products bear English names like
Peace and Seven Stars, giving them the kind of cachet that
French-sounding brands once had for Americans earlier in the
century.
   In February, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, in an
apparent reference to recent polls, worried that ``some (Americans)
are expressing the view that the economic threat from Japan is more
serious than the military threat from the Soviet Union.''
   ``The big problem underlying such a fear,'' he said, is ``that
it is impossible to guess where Japan's huge economic power is
headed, and under what philosophy or principles.
   ``What we need is to make further efforts to convey our views
and way of thinking clearly to Americans.''
   Accordingly, kokusaika, or ``internationalization,'' has become
the official rage in Japan. The government, for example, has
proposed tax breaks for companies that increase imports to Japan or
make donations in the United States.
   Most Japanese companies have rooted themselves in America as
successfully as their products _ and more successfully than their
European competitors, according to a survey released last year by
Columbia University's School of Business.
   The study found that, on average, Japanese firms in the United
States have outperformed European competitors in terms of low
absentee rates, low manager turnover and high product quality,
among other criteria.
   In addition, recent polls have found that while mistrust is on
the rise, a majority of Americans still have favorable feelings
toward Japan.
   So, trade frictions aside, what's wrong?
   For one thing, many Japan observers contend that at the level of
top management, at least, ``Americanization'' of Japanese-owned
firms in the United States is just window dressing, a commercial
ploy like the marketing of Christmas in Tokyo department stores,
where few shoppers are Christian.
   While Japan's famed worker-participation techniques, such as
quality circles, may work on the factory floor, American managers
of Japanese subsidiaries are still under the yoke of a ``shadow
system'' of command from Tokyo, some experts say.
   According to the first systematic survey of American managers in
Japanese corporations, released last fall by the University of
Michigan, most are excluded from planning and decision-making
inside the companies and have little access to strategic
information.
   Under the ``two-tiered'' Japanese employment system, Japanese
managers do a three- to five-year rotation abroad. When they return
to Japan, they are typically replaced by another Japanese executive
from overseas rather than the Americans who have worked alongside
them. This has led to resentment among many American managers.
   In addition, the Michigan study found that women and minorities
still suffer widespread discrimination by Japanese companies.
   Minolta's Kusumoto, who has been in the United States more than
20 years and recently published a book on his experiences, ``My
Bridge to America,'' asks that Americans be patient and recognize
that Japan's tightly knit society can unravel itself only so fast.
   ``Many Japanese are hesitant to disclose secrets to Americans,''
he says. ``We came from companies with so-called lifetime
employment. We have complete trust in an employee because we know
he's going to stay. But here many people come and go, and we think
maybe he'll give secrets to a competitor.''
   Kusumoto says that only recently have he and other Japanese
executives felt strongly enough of the loyalty of long-standing
American employees to promote them to top positions.
   ``It's not racial,'' he says. ``It's a matter of trust.''

   Anger over the U.S. trade deficit is fed by a
growing belief in Washington that Japan, once seen as a junior
partner recreated in our image after World War II, has been playing
by its own rules.
   In his much-discussed 1988 book, ``Trading Places,'' Clyde
Prestowitz, a Japan expert and former Commerce Department trade
negotiator, contends the Japanese have always identified national
security with economic security.
   While America has been preoccupied fighting the Cold War _ to
the benefit of allies such as Japan _ Japan has taken our trusting
free-traders for a ride, Prestowitz says.
   Unlike U.S. policy-makers hostile to direct government support
of business, Japan's powerful bureaucracy has generously subsidized
its key industries in an export-at-all-costs drive for global
supremacy in consumer electronics, automobiles and other important
industries.
   Unlike U.S. policy-makers concerned mostly about keeping
consumer prices low _ and thus markets open _ resource-poor Japan
has subtly but effectively closed many of its markets to foreign
imports. How else but through waves of unanswered exports could the
Japanese pay for their raw materials?
   The familiar pattern, the Prestowitz school says, was to force
leading U.S. companies to license their technology to Japan by
refusing them initial market entry there. Then, using the
technology, they built Japanese counterparts while protracting
open-market negotiations in the time-honored Japanese manner.
   Prestowitz notes that in other countries, particularly in
Europe, trade restrictions are also the norm, something that's all
the more forbidding considering the consolidation of the 320
million-consumer market of the European Community planned for 1992,
with the prospects of Eastern Europe joining in.
   ``American leaders show an amazing myopia,'' Prestowitz said in
a recent interview. ``At the moment in our dealing with Japan and
rest of the world our objective is to obtain some kind of utopian
free trade. To achieve that we effectively insist that everyone
change their societies to become like ours. When we were the big
guy on the block accounting for half the world's GNP we had a big
stick.
   ``These days we have a begging cup in our hand and people don't
really need to pay attention to us.''
   Prestowitz's answer, and that of a growing number of supporters,
is if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. They say the government needs
to ``manage'' trade in technologies critical to the sources of
waning U.S. strength, such as semiconductors, and to adopt
industrial policies to bolster them. As an example, Prestowitz
points to the strict tabs kept on international airline service and
banking.
   To Bush administration officials, however, Prestowitz's
conclusion smacks of heresy, raising the bugaboo of protectionism.
Their response is to lay on more open-market pressure.
   ``The administration is absolutely committed to the free-trade
principles we've followed for the last 40 years,'' says J. Michael
Farren, undersecretary for international trade in the Commerce
Department. ``Moving toward managed trade ... will undermine the
entire world trading system as we know it.''
   But Farren concedes that other countries are looking to Japan's
model.
   ``Japan is running the risk of spreading the contagion of closed
markets to the rest of world,'' he says.

   Stock prices rose sharply today, boosted by a
rebound in the Tokyo market and firm bond prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 34.46 to 2,734.91
as of 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 among New York
Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,037 up, 425 down and 471
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 121.38 million shares with one
hour of trading remaining.
   In Japan, prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped sharply in
nervous, roller-coaster trading. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
gained 757.65 points, or 2.7 percent, ending the day's session at
28,757.65.
   On Monday, Tokyo stock prices plummeted 6.6 percent in their
second-worst fall this year. The selloff initially spilled over to
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones average slipped as much as 30
points in early trading before firming to close 6.76 points lower
at 2,700.45.
   Analysts say the link between the Tokyo and New York markets is
not as strong as once believed. They also say most of the trouble
on the Japanese exchange is due to domestic concerns, including
interest-rate worries and a belief that stocks are overpriced
compared to earnings.
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.,
said the U.S. market today was encouraged by three factors: its
rebound Monday, the firming in Tokyo prices and a stable bond
market. Treasury bond prices were mixed in a narrow range today.
   Johnson said the recovery Monday in New York suggests ``that our
markets continue to manage the declines in Tokyo pretty easily.''
   Among actively traded blue-chip issues today, Philip Morris rose
1&lsqb; to 40|, Eastman Kodak rose 1&rsqb; to 40&rsqb;, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph was up &lsqb; at 41} and Union Carbide was up \ at 22&lsqb;.
   Among other active issues, Unocal dropped 1| to 32 after
negative analyst comments. A Merrill Lynch analyst lowered his
earnings forecast for the oil company and others said they were
less bullish on the stock. Unocal has been the subject of takeover
rumors in recent days.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
2.01 to 188.09. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 2.06 to 361.43.

<HEAD>`I Need 250 Thousand!': Lawyers Deal in Open Court; Trump Involved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   If deal-making really is art, then the bidding
for Bonwit Teller was the aesthetic equivalent of finger painting.
   A bankruptcy court hearing Monday turned into a corporate casbah
as attorneys frantically arranged offers for the failed department
store chain _ not over the typical Wall Street power lunch, but
within earshot of a federal judge.
   Deals came together, fell apart and came together again. Bidders
changed sides. A dramatic 11th-hour proposal by a would-be savior
failed. A lawyer played auctioneer as two sides upped offers $1
million at a pop, waiting for the opposition to crumble.
   ``I need 250 thousand from each of you and I need it now!''
implored Donald N. David, a lawyer representing deal-master Donald
Trump, to members of a group bidding on five of the 16 Bonwit
department stores.
   David got an icy stare from one participant, who refused to
raise his ante. A representative of Trump _ whose eponymous gold
Tower on Fifth Avenue houses Bonwit's flagship store _ and two
other groups contributed the difference. The deal lived.
   Bankruptcy court is becoming a home away from home for American
big business in the 1990s as companies stumble under the weight of
junk bonds and other takeover- and expasion-related problems in the
1980s, the decade of debt. A new era of restructuring means more
unusual proceedings like the one Monday in which about 200 people _
mostly lawyers _ crammed into a steamy bankruptcy courtroom
overlooking New York Harbor.
   Amid shouting, cajoling, the toot of the Staten Island Ferry and
pounding of a jackhammer six floors below, Bonwit's was carved into
pieces. Lawyers constantly pleaded for another minute as they
huddled to cut a deal.
   Most unusual was that the nearly 10-hour ordeal took place in
open court, where judges rarely tolerate more than one person
speaking at a time _ always deferentially _ let alone protests and
open outcry bidding.
   ``I've never seen anything like it before,'' David, of the New
York firm Dreyer &amp; Traub, said Tuesday. ``I think if it weren't for
that informality they wouldn't have raised anywhere near the amount
of money they did for the estate.''
   L.J. Hooker Corp., Bonwit's Atlanta-based parent, held the
auction to boost the liquidation value of the upscale store chain
it bought three years ago. Hooker had received just one bid for
five stores prior to the auction.
   On Monday, the take for Hooker creditors rose by millions. Also,
some of the stores may survive.
   A first round of bidding included offers from a French retailer,
a Florida department store, a Buffalo chain, a Canadian investor
and a group that included Trump and the women's apparel store the
Limited.
   As the second round began, the Trump group booted the Limited
and embraced Pyramid Cos., a Syracuse, N.Y.-based shopping mall
developer and owner that already had made the pre-auction,
five-store bid.
   When it became apparent the group needed to raise its $20.25
million offer or lose out to a possible combination of other bids,
the haggling intensified. David, an energetic bearded man with a
thick New York accent, hustled about a station of about 15 lawyers
and businessmen seeking more money.
   He got it. In 20 minutes, the bid rose by $1.5 million,
collapsing once in the process.
   Meantime, the court looked more like Sotheby's when two bidders
battled for a Bonwit store in exclusive Palm Beach, Fla. Lawyers
for Frances Brewster Inc., a Florida retailer, and Ralph Hibbard, a
Canadian investor, called bids from opposite sides of the
courtroom, raising the price to $2.2 million from $1.6 million.
   ``Sounds like an auction,'' Bankruptcy Judge Tina Brozman said
to laughter.
   After the Hibbard group conceded, Hooker lawyer Sheldon Hirshon,
serving as impromptu auctioneer, said: ``Going once, going
twice...''
   The final drama was provided by the day's hoped-for white
knight. Hooker lawyers had wanted to preserve the Bonwit's chain.
In the morning they announced that a group led by Bonwit's ex-CEO
William Ruben was planning a bid for 13 stores. In the
mid-afternoon they said the deal was off.
   Around 6:30 p.m., lawyers told the judge it was on again. Ruben
showed up in court and told reporters his $36 million bid could
make Bonwit ``viable again.'' All he needed was one day to arrange
financing.
   Furious, David said reopening the bidding would violate an
agreement and ``make a fool out of everybody here.'' Hooker
attorneys eventually acquiesced, fearing they could lose all bids
if the Ruben group collapsed.
   Attorney Alan Hyman said Hooker decided ``to resort to the heady
and cerebral theory that a bird in the hand was worth two in the
bush.'' David, an hour after pacing angrily and saying, ``It's
off,'' gave associates two thumbs up.

<HEAD>OPEC Production Steady in March, but Still Above Output Cap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC nations held oil production steady
in March but remained more than a million barrels a day above their
self-imposed supply cap, according to estimates released Tuesday.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped a total
of about 23.7 million barrels a day in March, the same as in the
previous month, according to the Paris-based International Energy
Agency.
   Sales of OPEC crude oil in March were believed to be lower than
production due to apparent excess supply of heavy, sour grades and
weaker than expected demand from refiners, the group stated.
   Private analysts predicted the cartel would increase output even
more this month.
   ``It seems it will go up in April, maybe to as much as 24
million barrels a day,'' said Pierre Terzian, editor of the
Paris-based newsletter Petrostrategies.
   Leading the surge in last month's production were Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria, according to the
International Energy Agency's Monthly Oil Market Report. All were
estimated to be above the individual quotas the cartel set for each
country last year and reaffirmed at a recent meeting in Vienna.
   The organization imposed a cartel-wide ceiling of 22.1 million
barrels a day for production in the first half of 1990, to help
support a price of $18 a barrel. But members, led by Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates, have been cheating on their quotas.
   Oil prices soared in early January but have been gradually
slipping since then, falling in early March below $18.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by the
agency was $17.33 a barrel in the last week of March, down from
$17.47 the previous week.
   Prices of West Texas Intermediate, the key American grade, have
ranged from $20 to $22 a barrel during that time.
   In an effort to keep prices firm, OPEC oil ministers met last
month and issued a fresh call for restraint by all nations in the
normally weak April-June quarter.
   Analysts say that if the cartel keeps production high, prices
will weaken in the coming months.
   Demand for crude normally slumps in the second quarter when
spring weather warms the United States and other consuming nations.
The International Energy Agency predicted demand for OPEC oil at
20.4 million barrels a day in the current quarter.
   Analysts argue that some of the producers, particularly Kuwait,
want prices to stay at the $18 level so the cartel does not lose
market share to other oil-producing nations. High prices will
prompt other suppliers to pump more.
   According to the oil market report, Saudi Arabia, the world's
No. 1 oil exporter, pumped 5.6 million barrels a day in March,
above its quota of 5.4 million barrels.
   Iran and Iraq were about at their quotas of 3.1 million barrels
a day.
   The United Arab Emirates produced some 2 million barrels a day,
about double its supply cap. Kuwait's output was estimated at 1.8
million barrels a day, above its limit of 1.5 million barrels.
   Nigeria supplied about 1.8 million barrels a day, up from its
quota of 1.6 million barrels.
   Other production estimates for March were: Libya, 1.3 million
barrels a day; Algeria, 800,000 barrels; Gabon, 300,000 barrels;
Venezuela, 1.9 million barrels; Ecuador, 300,000 barrels, and
Indonesia, 1.3 million barrels.
   The International Energy Agency is an arm of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, made up of two dozen
industrialized nations.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed
mostly higher Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
speculative buying centered in the corn and wheat markets.
   The late rally in the grains spilled over into soybean trading,
reversing a slide that had threatened to extend the sharp losses
posted Monday, when soybean futures plunged as much as 11\ cents a
bushel.
   Brokerage houses and independent floor traders did most of the
buying while commercial grain dealers were net sellers on the day,
said Victor Lespinasse, a floor trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   He linked the rally to rumors of new Soviet purchases of U.S.
corn and to expectations for a seasonal advance in prices as the
1990 growing season begins.
   Grain and soybean futures typically rise early in the growing
season as traders focus on weather conditions and the potential for
crop damage.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 5}
cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.61{ a
bushel; corn was 1} cents to 2} cents higher with May at $2.66\ a
bushel; oats were { cent to 1 cent higher with May at $1.52\ a
bushel; soybeans were \ cent to 2\ cents higher with May at $5.85\
a bushel.

   The energy futures market finished mixed in
quiet trading Tuesday, with prices of crude oil and unleaded
gasoline losing ground and home heating oil posting gains.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for May
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, fell 18 cents to $20.30 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract
had advanced 20 cents on Monday.
   Among refined petroleum products, wholesale home heating oil for
May delivery rose 0.23 cent to 55.50 cents a gallon, after gaining
0.93 cent Monday.
   May unleaded gasoline, which settled up 0.72 cent in the
previous session, declined 0.20 cent to 65.8 cents a gallon.
   Natural gas contracts traded on the New York Merc for the first
time Tuesday. The June contract settled at $1.685 per 1,000 cubic
feet.
   Peter Beutel, an energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc., said
internal market influences were largely responsible for Tuesday's
price fluctuations in the absence of any fundamental factors.
   ``Trading was quiet today,'' he said. ``A lot of people were
involved earlier in the day promoting new natural gas contracts.''

   The dollar finished mixed against major foreign
currencies in light trading Tuesday as dealers lacked incentives to
buy or sell heavily.
   Gold gained in trading at home and abroad. On the Commodity
Exchange in New York, gold bullion for April delivery settled at
$375.30 a troy ounce, up $5.50 from Monday. Later, Republic
National Bank of New York quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at
$375.25 as of 4 p.m. EDT, $5 higher than Monday's late bid.
   Currency dealers said the dollar traded in a narrow range for
much of the day. Renewed demand to buy dollars against the Japanese
yen in particular surfaced in afternoon domestic trading and pushed
the dollar higher.
   The dollar ended in New York at 159.76 yen, up from 158.65 yen
on Monday. But in Tokyo trading, which ends as Europe's business
day begins, the dollar declined to 158.95 yen, 1.00 yen lower than
Monday's close. In London, the dollar traded at 159.10 yen.
   Richard Levine, a vice president at Elders Futures Inc., said
trading was generally light. There were no fundamental developments
that caused any shift in sentiment toward the dollar.
   Dealers overseas said there was a cautious approach to the U.S.
currency ahead of talks this weekend among the Group of Seven
industrial nations. The finance ministers of the United States,
West Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy and Canada are
scheduled to meet in Paris on April 7.
   Although worries about German unification and questions about
Japan's ability to support the sagging yen tended to support the
dollar, those factors did not provoke fresh dollar buying in
Europe, dealers said.
   The British pound was quoted at $1.6345 late in London, up from
$1.6300 late Monday. In New York, sterling fell to $1.6358 from
$1.6390 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes
Monday, included: 1.6990 West German marks, up from 1.6985; 1.5035
Swiss francs, up from 1.5010; 5.7085 French francs, down from
5.7105; 1,247.75 Italian lire, down from 1,249.25; and 1.1656
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1678.
   Selected dollar rates late in Europe, compared with late
Monday's levels were: 1.7005 West German marks, down from 1.7052;
1.5035 Swiss francs, down from 1.5068; 5.7140 French francs, down
from 5.7300; 1.9150 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9193; 1,254.00
Italian lire, down from 1,254.25; and 1.1660 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1690.
   Rumors of possibly heavy gold buying by investors from the
Middle East lifted prices. Gold bullion posted mostly solid gains
in European and Asian trading before strengthening in the United
States.
   In London, gold traded late in the day at $375.05 a troy ounce,
up from $368.95 Monday's late bid. In Zurich, Switzerland, the late
bid was $376 an ounce, up from $368.75 late Monday. Gold rose 78
cents in Hong Kong to close at $371.94.
   Silver also rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $5.007 a troy ounce, up from $4.946
Monday. In London the late silver bid was $5.02 a troy ounce, up
from Monday's $4.96.

<HEAD>ABC, CBS, NBC Heads: Need `Level Playing Field' for Free TV to
Thrive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The heads of the big three TV networks complained
Tuesday that cable television had several profitable advantages
over them, although the chief of third-place CBS said his company
had no plans to develop cable ventures as the other two had.
   Chief executive officers Thomas Murphy of ABC, Laurence Tisch of
CBS and Robert Wright of NBC each told the National Association of
Broadcasters that one expensive factor affecting the networks was
regulations enabling them to lock up shows for only four years.
   After the four-year period, the networks end up paying huge sums
to production studios to retain shows that had become hits.
   NBC just bought a seventh year of ``The Cosby Show'' at a
reported $50 million, the most expensive renewal in TV history.
   ``We're in the worst of all worlds,'' Tisch said. ``We are
allowed to lose money if it doesn't work, but not allowed to make
any money if it does work.''
   With network costs soaring and advertising revenue sluggish _
while competing cable channels are reaping revenue from advertising
and subscriber fees _ ``we have to develop other revenue streams,''
Wright said.
   He said ratings indicate the majority of TV viewers still are
watching the big three networks, but they're nevertheless paying
for cable TV. ``None of us get any of that money,'' Wright said.
   Broadcasters are asking Congress to make cable companies pay for
carrying broadcast television programming.
   ABC and NBC are in the cable TV business _ ABC by ownership of
ESPN and Lifetime, and NBC with its C-NBC cable channel _ but CBS
has no such ventures.
   ``I think we missed the boat, perhaps,'' Tisch said. ``Maybe we
should have been in the business 10 or 12 years ago.
   ``But I can't picture CBS developing a cable network that could
be profitable, and I'm not in the mood to bang my head against the
wall for 10 years. ... The only thing a new toy would do is assure
that we stay in third place forever. If we're going to succeed,
we'll succeed as free broadcasters.''
   Murphy said ABC was fortunate that its cable ventures,
particularly ESPN, were well established.
   CBS, meanwhile, has spent billions of dollars for network sports
programming, including new contracts with Major League Baseball and
the National Football League.
   ``Financially, it's not a gamble,'' Tisch said. ``We need the
sports support. ...I think the advertisers will be there.''
   Murphy said ABC did not give up on sports, ``We got outbid. We
decided we'd rather put our money on series programming.''
   In response to questioning, Tisch said there was no instability
at CBS Sports, despite the sudden sacking of top sportscaster Brent
Musburger on Sunday.
   The dumping of Musburger and his reported $2 million salary by
third-place CBS ``wasn't a message,'' Tisch said. ``It was an
individual negotiation which didn't work out.''
   Earlier Tuesday, Federal Communications Commission Chairman
Alfred Sikes told the broadcasters he supports self-regulation of
radio and television, but he pledged not to permit ``regulatory
neglect'' when rules and practices hamper competition.
   Getting agreement on standards of broadcast content will be
difficult, he said, but the public will demand them and the
question is ``who will act to set them.''

<HEAD>Gold Futures Rise Sharply; Saudi Buying Seen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices rose sharply Tuesday in a burst of Middle
Eastern buying, possibly by some of the same investors whose sale
last week of at least a million ounces of the metal triggered a
collapse in prices to 4{-month lows.
   On other commodity markets, copper futures climbed strongly;
cocoa futures surged; grains and soybeans advanced; oil futures
were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $5.50 to $5.90 higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in April at
$375.30 a troy ounce; silver futures finished 6 cents to 6.4 cents
higher with April at $5.007 a troy ounce.
   Analysts said heavy buying of gold bullion occurred overnight in
Tokyo and London, sparking rumors that Saudi investors were buying
back at a profit some of the gold they were believed to have sold
on March 26 for British pounds.
   Observers were divided on how much gold was purchased. But they
agreed that it appeared to be less than the huge amount sold last
week when investors around the world jumped on the bandwagon and
dumped an estimated 2 million ounces of bullion onto the market.
   Analyst James Steel of Refco Inc. in New York said the Saudis
may have bought only 25,000 ounces and appeared to have sold no
British pounds, which cast doubt on speculation that a reversal of
last week's move was in the works.
   But George Milling-Stanley, first vice president in charge of
bullion sales for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said the parties who
started last week's selloff had reversed ``a good chunk'' of their
sales. What had not occurred, he said, was follow-through buying
Tuesday by U.S. and Far Eastern investors.
   Analysts agreed the market was likely to remain jittery and that
a rally back above $400 an ounce was unlikely without substantial
buying by the Japanese, who have been largely absent from the gold
market for the past two months.
   ``It's going to take some volume buying by somebody or other and
it could very well be the Asians,'' said Milling-Stanley.
   Copper futures surged late in the session on sketchy reports of
a mudslide in Chile, one of the world's largest copper-producing
countries.
   Copper settled 2.5 cents to 3.85 cents higher on the Commodity
Exchange with April at $1.274 a troy ounce.
   Cocoa futures leaped as much as $52 a ton on New York's Coffee
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange on technically inspired buying after two
days of lower prices.
   Cocoa settled $48 to $52 higher with May at $1,215 per ton.
   Most grain and soybean futures rose on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid speculative buying centered in the corn and wheat
markets.
   The late rally in the grains spilled over into soybean trading,
reversing a slide that had threatened to extend the sharp losses
posted Monday, when soybean futures plunged as much as 11\ cents a
bushel.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 5} cents higher with May
at $3.61{ a bushel; corn was 2\ cents to 3 cents higher with May at
$2.66{ a bushel; oats were } cent to 1 cent higher with May at
$1.52\ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3} cents higher with May
at $5.86 a bushel.
   Energy futures mostly declined on the New York Mercantile
Exchange ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly
inventories report. The report showed a greater-than-expected
increase of 4.3 million barrels of U.S. crude-oil stocks last week,
a larger-than-expected decline of 7.1 million barrels of gasoline,
and a smaller-than-expected drop of 0.9 million barrels of heating
oil.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 18 cents
lower with May at $20.30 a barrel; heating oil was .05 cent lower
to .23 cent higher with May at 55.50 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .20 cent to .40 cent lower with May at 65.88 cents a
gallon.
   Natural gas futures began trading Tuesday on the New York Merc.
The contract for delivery in June traded from $1.58 to $1.655,
settling at $1.635 per million British thermal units.
   Cattle futures slipped on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on
expectations of rising cattle supplies; pork futures were mixed
after Monday's sharp gains.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .38 cent lower with April at
78.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .30 cent lower
with April at 82.60 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to
.45 cent higher with April at 54.72 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .57 cent lower to .20 cent higher with May at 55 cents
a pound.

<HEAD>Companies To Provide Digital Music Service Over Cable TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A maker of cable television equipment and a
media company said Tuesday they would launch a system to send
digital music programming over cable TV lines.
   Scientific-Atlanta Inc. said it will make the gear to send the
music, while International Cablecasting Technologies Inc. said it
will provide the musical programming over 27 channels initially. Up
to 288 channels could be used eventually, the companies said.
   The system will allow the transmission of compact disc-quality
sound over a satellite network that will be hooked into local cable
TV systems. In the home, the system will be attached to a
subscriber's stereo system.
   The service, called the Digital Music Network, is scheduled to
be launched this fall, the companies said.
   Tele-Communications Inc. and Viacom International Inc., both
major operators of cable TV systems, and Prime Cable, another cable
operator, have signed on to offer the service to more than 5
million subscribers, said Jerold H. Rubinstein, chairman of ICT.
Rubinstein is a former chairman of ABC Records and former chairman
and co-owner of United Artists Records.
   Scientific-Atlanta is a major maker of cable TV selector boxes
and satellite transmission equipment.

<HEAD>Turner Blames Competitors, Not Consumers for Cable Reregulation
Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable television pioneer Ted Turner on Tuesday
said cable TV's competitors and not cable subscribers are
responsible for rallying efforts to impose more regulations on the
cable industry.
   The chairman and president of Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
also said he opposed the heavy investment being made in developing
expensive high definition television while half the world still
doesn't have television at all.
   ``Before the rich world pigs out on a $3,000 television set that
is only slightly better maybe we ought to furnish the people in the
world with black and white sets,'' Turner said.
   He also said his company's talks on possible ventures with CBS
Inc. have run into ``blind alleys'' but are continuing.
   Addressing the annual conference of the Advertising Research
Foundation, Turner was asked whether he thought customer complaints
about price increases or service were driving recent proposals to
reregulate the cable TV industry.
   Turner said it was neither and said surveys have shown ``the
vast majority of cable subscribers are perfectly happy'' with their
cable service.
   He said broadcasters, the motion picture industry and
independent television are ``whipping Washington into a frenzy
because they are really scared to death of cable now. I think
that's most of it.''
   Turner's Atlanta-based company produces the Cable News Network,
Headline News and Turner Network Television as well as the
superstation WTBS. Its owners include some of the major cable TV
system operators.
   In his speech to the researchers, Turner said the globalization
of communications has contributed to efforts to outlaw most
whaling, save the African elephants and tear down the Iron Curtain
in Eastern Europe.
   He said that in 10 years, there would not be a single
dictatorship or totalitarian state in the world.
   In a question and answer session, he was asked about the
development of HDTV, a technology that will make television
pictures much sharper.
   Turner said he was against it because ``half the people in the
world don't have a television set, half the people in the world
don't have electricity.''
   He said HDTV would also make the trade deficit with Japan larger
because ``they will be made in Japan, you wait and see, all of
them.''
   Turner was asked about reports that he is trying to reach a
cooperation agreement with CBS Inc., the operator of the CBS
Television Network and a company he once tried to acquire.
   He noted CBS and his company already have reached a deal on
providing coverage of the Winter Olympics.
   ``We may do something else one of these days, but it's not
easy,'' Turner said. He said the CBS News department is ``not too
enthusiastic about doing anything with us but top management I
think is.''
   ``We are exploring a number of things but we have run into a
number of blind alleys so far. We are having fun and we are
talking,'' he said.

   Stock prices rose sharply and broadly Tuesday in
moderate trading, boosted by a rebound in the Tokyo market and firm
bond prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 36.26 to 2,736.71.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by more than 2 to 1
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 1,071 up, 431 down and 468 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 154.31 million
shares, up from 124.36 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 182.88 million shares.
   In Japan, prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped in nervous,
roller-coaster trading. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
757.65 points, or 2.7 percent, ending the day's session at
28,759.72.
   On Monday, while the U.S. dollar surged to a three-year high
against the Japanese yen, the Nikkei index shed 1,978.38 points, or
6.59 percent, to 28,002.07. It was the index's second largest
single-day decline ever.
   
   
   On Monday, Tokyo stock prices plummeted 6.6 percent in their
second-worst fall this year. The selloff initially spilled over to
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones average slipped as much as 30
points in early trading before firming to close 6.76 points lower
at 2,700.45.
   Analysts say the link between the Tokyo and New York markets is
not as strong as once believed. They also say most of the trouble
on the Japanese exchange is due to domestic concerns, including
interest-rate worries and a belief that stocks are overpriced
compared to earnings.
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.,
said the U.S. market Tuesday was encouraged by three factors: its
rebound Monday, the firming in Tokyo prices and a stable bond
market. Treasury bond prices rose moderately by the close after
trading in a narrow range.
   Johnson said the recovery Monday in New York suggests ``that our
markets continue to manage the declines in Tokyo pretty easily.''
   Other analysts said the rally could be short-lived due to the
moderate trading volume Tuesday.
   Philip Morris was the most-active NYSE issue, with 2.5 million
shares changing hands as the stock rose 1&rsqb; to 40~.
   Among other active blue chips, Eastman Kodak rose 1{ to 40{,
General Electric gained 1 to 65, Exxon rose ~ to 47&lsqb; and IBM rose }
to 106|.
   Unocal, the second most-active issue, dropped 1| to 32 after a
Merrill Lynch analyst lowered his earnings forecast for the oil
company and others said they were less bullish on the stock. Unocal
has been the subject of takeover rumors in recent days.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market grew by $41.984 billion, or 1.29
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
2.47 to 188.55.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 6.10 to 398.94, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 4.94 to 343.64.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
4.47 to 437.65. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index rose 2.28 to 361.65.

   Allegheny International Inc. said it will ask
a federal bankruptcy court to disallow a New York investment
group's votes against the company's reorganization plan.
   The company said Monday it had received the necessary two-thirds
majority vote from all classes of its creditors and shareholders
except the senior secured bank class and the senior unsecured class.
   The vote fell short in those categories because of negative
votes cast by Japonica Partners and its affiliates, Allegheny
International said.
   Japonica Partners is competing with Allegheny International's
management to take over the Pittsburgh-based company.
   The company said it will file suit in U.S. Bankruptcy Court to
disallow the votes of Japonica and its affiliates, saying it
questions their motives in rejecting the plan.
   ``AI is pressing forward to have its plan of reorganization
confirmed,'' Chairman Oliver S. Travers said.
   Japonica responded with a statement saying, ``We believe there
is no basis whatsoever for excluding the votes of any Allegheny
constituent who voted against management's plan and that any
attempt by management to resuscitate its failed plan ... will not
be successful.''
   Management reorganization plan is worth about $687 million and
would pay off creditors and shareholders with stock in a
reorganized company.
   Japonica, meanwhile, proposes paying creditors and shareholders
in cash. The partnership has said it has a $120 million line of
credit.
   Bankruptcy court is scheduled to begin confirmation hearings on
the plan April 19.

   Xerox Corp. said it would take a pre-tax

Chicago-based real estate company.
   VMS Realty acquires, manages and develops hotels, office

   The company announced in February that it had ceased all but
essential payments to its creditors because of severe financial
problems.
   A Xerox subsidiary paid $106 million for a 25 percent equity
stake in the company in 1987. In addition, the subsidiary holds VMS
subordinated notes and accrued interest totalling $136 million, and
has extended a $125 million in credit to the company through an
unsecured line of credit, Xerox said.
   Through its third-party financing operations, Xerox also has
$200 million in collateral loans and other secured financing
arrangements with VMS.
   Xerox said it was writing down the investments after evaluating

   Xerox said it would release its first quarter results toward the

<HEAD>Icahn Says Divided USX Worth 35 Percent More</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carl Icahn said Tuesday his plan to break up
USX Corp. into separate energy and steel businesses would be worth
a third more than the company's current market value.
   In a letter to other USX investors, a shareholders committee led
by the New York investor estimated the value of the plan at $48 a
share, including $39 a share for USX's Marathon Oil Co. subsidiary
and $9 a share for its U.S. Steel unit.
   USX stock closed at $37.12{ Tuesday, up $1.50 a share on the New
York Stock Exchange. Icahn claimed his plan would boost shareholder
value by 35 percent based on Monday's closing stock price of
$35.62{ a share.
   Icahn, who owns 13.29 percent of USX, or about 34 million
shares, has asked the company's 144,000 shareholders to approve a
plan to spin off at least 80 percent of U.S. Steel to existing
shareholders, with the remaining 20 percent going to new investors.
The spinoff company would assume no more than $1.5 billion of the
steel division's long-term debt.
   USX management has opposed the plan, saying it would make
Marathon and U.S. Steel more vulnerable to slumps in either the
energy or steel industries. USX bought Marathon in the early 1980s
as a cushion against cyclical swings in the steel business.
   USX has said 65 percent of its revenues come from Marathon,
while 31 percent come from steel operations.
   Icahn said in the letter that USX could properly structure the
breakup to make it essentially tax-free to the company and its
stockholders. The plan would preserve net operating losses of USX,
he said.
   USX Chairman Charles Corry recently told Wall Street analysts
that Icahn's plan would cause tax difficulties because the company
could lose tax credits resulting from steel losses in the early
1980s.
   The stockholders will cast non-binding votes on Icahn's proposal
May 7 at Marathon Oil's headquarters in Findlay, Ohio.
   Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., is joined on
his stockholders committee by TWA Vice Chairman Alfred Kingsley and
McDEP Associates Inc. Chairman Kurt Wulff.
   Icahn said he based the $48-a-share figure on analyses by the
committee and by McDEP.
   USX officials were not immediately available for comment Tuesday
night.

   MCA Inc. film chief Thomas Pollock was given
MCA stock worth $5.7 million in 1989 and stock options worth $7.8
million when issued last August, according to proxy material
shareholders received this week.
   Pollock also was paid a base salary of $627,000 last year,
bringing his total compensation to more than $14 million. His
salary was raised to $850,000 this year.
   Sidney Sheinberg, president of the Universal City-based movie,
TV, music and theme park giant, was issued stock worth $7.2 million
last year, and his salary jumps to $900,000 this year from $729,000
in 1989. MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman's salary also jumps to $900,000
from $559,000.
   The figures were contained in proxy material sent out in advance
of the company's annual meeting May 8 in Chicago. Among other
things, the material asks shareholders to approve a new stock
option plan under which Pollock was given his options.
   The plan authorizes the issuance of 5 million new shares,
600,000 of which would become available to Pollock at $55 a share
over the next five years. He may exercise 20 percent of the options
once a year, beginning this July.
   MCA's stock was trading at $68 a share when they were awarded
last August. It has since fallen in value, closing at $50.50 on the
New York Stock Exchange Tuesday. At that level, Pollock would lose
money by exercising his options.
   MCA's last stock option plan was approved in 1968 but never
exercised. The company said the new plan was needed to provide
competitive compensation for MCA executives.
   That was a reference to outfits like Walt Disney Co., whose
Chairman President Frank Wells made $72.4 million on the sale of
stock bought through options in 1989.
   Also in the material, MCA urged a ``no'' vote on a shareholders
proposal calling for no more MCA productions such as last year's
Martin Scorsese movie, ``The Last Temptation of Christ.''
   Some religious groups objected that the movie depicted Jesus as
weak, confused and lustful.
   The supporting statement for the proposal says Jesus is shown as
a ``disturbed man who frequents brothels, hallucinates seeing
snakes, vows that he always tells lies and acts only as a result of
fear, says that he sins a lot and asks forgiveness from a
prostitute, and feels tormented by God.''
   The proposal, made by Dean Shahinian of Alexandria, Va., calls
for all shareholders to censure MCA for ``anti-Christian effects.''
   ``We urge management to establish a corporate policy not to use
corporate assets to falsely defame Jesus Christ or other major
religious leaders,'' it says.
   In opposing the proposal, MCA said censoring a film because it
contains an unconventional religious viewpoint could stifle
religious and creative expression.
   Noting that Scorsese won a best director Oscar nomination for
``Temptation,'' MCA said the film was Scorsese's interpretation of
a novel, not the company's view of Christ.
   ``The democratic way is to discuss, to debate,'' MCA said.

<HEAD>United Pays $77.5 Million To Settle Reservations Complaints</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines agreed to pay $77.5 million to
settle lawsuits filed by Continental Airlines and others accusing
United of unfair competition in the computerized reservations
business, according to documents made public Tuesday.
   United, a subsidiary of Chicago-based UAL Corp., revealed the
amount of the settlement in its annual report filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement was reported
last week by Continental but the amount wasn't disclosed.
   United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker said she could not comment on
the settlement beyond what was contained in the SEC filing.
   In the filing, United said the settlement concluded three cases
that were initiated from Sept. 1985 to March 1989 by Continental,
New York Air Inc., Frontier Airlines and System One, a computerized
reservations system operated by Continental's parent company, Texas
Air Corp.
   The plaintiffs contended United illegally monopolized or
attempted to monopolize the computer reservations business or the
air transportation business in various markets.
   The settlement was reached last Wednesday, shortly before the
beginning of jury deliberations in a 10-week trial of Continental's
lawsuit in federal court.
   Continental had sought $336 million in damages, claiming United
programmed its computer reservations system to unfairly favor
United flights over its competitors.
   Continental also accused United of overcharging it and other
carriers for the reservation service.
   Last year, American Airlines settled similar allegations by
Continental for a reported $100 million.
   United prevailed last December in a similar suit filed in 1984
on behalf of 11 other airlines, including USAir. An appeal in that
case is pending.

<DATELINE>MADISON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schering-Plough Corp. said it has agreed to
sell its Maybelline cosmetics business for about $300 million in
cash as part of its plan to concentrate on pharmaceuticals.
   The buyer is MBP Acquisition Corp., which consists of Playtex
Family Products, members of Playtex and Maybelline management, the
private investment firm of Thomas H. Lee Co. and certain of the
Boston firm's affiliated investment funds, Schering-Plough said
Tuesday.
   Merrill Lynch Capital Markets assisted Schering-Plough in the
transaction, which requires government approval.
   The sale stems from Schering-Plough's decision to concentrate on
prescription and over-the-counter drugs as well as personal care
and vision care products, said Robert P. Luciano, chairman and
chief executive officer of Schering-Plough.
   In July, Schering-Plough sold its two European cosmetics
companies, Rimmel International Ltd. and Chicogo GmbH. Last
December, the company announced it was seeking offers for
Maybelline.
   In 1989, Schering-Plough recorded total cosmetics sales of about
$300 million, most of which were generated by Maybelline, the
company said.

<HEAD>Dollar, Share Prices Higher in Tokyo</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with morning Nikkei, comments</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Wednesday morning while the dollar was firm against the yen and
interest rates rose.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gained 212.05 points, or 0.74
percent, ending the morning session at 28,971.77.
   The dollar was changing hands at 159.32 yen late in the morning,
off from 159.62 yen at the opening but up from Tuesday's close of
158.95 yen. The U.S. currency ranged between 159.28 yen and 159.70
yen during the morning.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bonds slipped
to 86.21 points late in the morning from Tuesday's close of 86.51.
That boosted its yield to 7.311 percent from 7.245 percent.
   Currency trading was calm in Tokyo, where the dollar's higher
opening followed overnight gains in New York, dealers said.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, who requested anonymity, said
the dollar gained in New York because of renewed speculation the
U.S. Federal Reserve has been halting its support for the yen in an
attempt to pressure Japan to make trade concessions in talks being
held in Washington.
   ``The rumor has been in the market for some time, and it was
brought up again in New York. Such speculation has been already
factored into the market here,'' the dealer said.
   Another Bank of Tokyo dealer said the Group of Seven (G-7)
industrialized nations may take some measures to defend the yen
against the dollar when monetary authorities meet in Paris on
Saturday.
   Other dealers said bullish sentiment toward the dollar remained
unchanged with no new market-affecting news.
   Stability in the currency market contributed to the increase in
the Nikkei index, said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a stock trader with Daiwa
Securities Co.
   ``Reassured by the yen's stability in the last couple of days,
stock investors continued to buy today following yesterday's
gains,'' he added.
   On Tuesday, the index rose 757.65 points, following Monday's
crash of 1,978.38 points, or 6.59 percent, its second-largest
single-day decline. The plunge followed a 1,045.71-point fall in
the index last Friday.
   As of Tuesday's closing, the Nikkei index had lost more than
10,000 points, or 26 percent, since the beginning of the year.

   Dallas' two newspapers went to court Tuesday in a
fight over syndicated comic strips and columns, the latest twist in
a bitter competition between the two dailies that cover the
nation's eighth largest city.
   The Dallas Times Herald is seeking at least $33 million in
actual damages for what it considers a grab for monopoly by The
Dallas Morning News and its parent, A.H. Belo Corp.
   The purchase of the syndicated features ``is not something done
in an open competitive way,'' Times Herald attorney Frank Jones
told jurors during opening statements. ``We think it was done in a
way to destroy newspaper competition in Dallas, Texas. We think
this is a case of preserving competition of newspapers in Dallas
County.
   ``We think the evidence will show total arrogance and disregard
by The Dallas Morning News,'' Jones said.
   Lawyers for The Morning News countered that the paper was just
competing and was willing to pay more for the contested features.
   ``The only thing is, we went out and competed with them for
these features and paid a better price,'' said Harry Reasoner, an
attorney for Belo. ``Did we go out and pay a better price? You
betcha. Did we tortiously interfere and violate the law? No.''
   At issue is a joint venture Belo formed last year with Universal
Press Syndicate Inc. to develop syndicate features for television
use.
   Part of their agreement was that Universal Press invoke a clause
in its contract with the Times Herald allowing it to break off
service. The Times Herald lost 26 features distributed by Universal
Press, including Dear Abby, Erma Bombeck and Doonesbury.
   The Times Herald contends the deal violates anti-trust laws. The
Morning News maintains it's just fair competition.
   Testimony was scheduled to begin Wednesday and the trial is
expected to last more than a month.
   In addition to actual damages, the Times Herald is seeking
unspecified punitive damages from its larger rival.
   Times Herald attorney Wayne Fisher told prospective jurors that
anti-competitive practices in the Dallas media market threatened to
drive the Times Herald out of business and could inflate the value
of The Morning News by as much as $500 million.
   The Morning News attracts about 60 percent of newspaper
advertising and circulation in Dallas, court documents show.
   ``It's important to see if The Dallas Morning News can get away
with the conduct they've been getting away with over the past
year,'' Fisher said. ``If they do, the dangerous possibility is the
Dallas Times Herald will not survive or The Dallas Morning News may
get what the law calls monopoly power.''
   ``What the Times Herald is telling you is they would not like
The Morning News to compete for these features,'' countered William
Sims, an attorney for The Morning News. ``They don't want to up the
ante, and that's not what competition is all about. We have the
right to compete for these features.''
   The lawsuit is the latest legal salvo in the papers' prolonged
battle, which in the past focused on challenging circulation
features.
   As a result of the Universal Belo joint venture, the Times
Herald also is asking the Federal Communications Commission to
revoke the license of Belo's WFAA-TV, the top-rated television
station in Dallas.
