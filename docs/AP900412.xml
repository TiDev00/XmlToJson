   A jury Thursday recommended execution
for a convict who murdered his ex-wife while on prison furlough
last year.
   Alan L. Matheney, 39, stood quietly as Lake County Superior
Court Judge James E. Letsinger read the recommendation of death in
the electric chair. Letsinger, who must make the final decision,
set sentencing for May 4.
   The same jury Wednesday rejected Matheney's insanity defense and
convicted him of murder and burglary in the March 4, 1989, beating
death of Lisa Marie Bianco.
   The jury deliberated for more than four hours Thursday before
issuing a recommendation. Had jurors not elected to recommend
death, they could have urged a prison sentence of up to 60 years
for murder and 20 years for burglary.
   Matheney's mother, Martha Matheney, showed no reaction to the
decision as she sat in the back row of the courtroom.
   The victim's father, Eugene Bianco, said he was pleased. ``It's
a just sentence for the crime he committed,'' Bianco said. ``I hope
it doesn't drag on for years.''
   A death sentence would automatically be appealed to the state
Supreme Court.
   Bianco said his grandchildren still have nightmares about the
night Matheney broke into their home, armed with an unloaded
shotgun, and threatened their mother. Matheney chased Ms. Bianco
into the street and beat her outside a neighbor's home.
   ``The kids miss their mother more, and they wish Mr. Matheney
was no longer their father,'' Bianco said.
   Letsinger extended a gag order on attorneys until sentencing.
St. Joseph County Prosecutor Michael P. Barnes cited the order and
declined to comment.
   Defense attorney Scott L. King, however, held a brief news
conference outside the courthouse and said he would argue for a
prison term.
   The state proved two circumstances _ burglary and lying in wait
_ to justify the death penalty, county deputy prosecutor John D.
Krisor said earlier.
   The slaying sparked a furor over officials' failure to notify
Ms. Bianco, 29, of the furlough for Matheney, who had been serving
an eight-year sentence for assaulting her in 1987. The state's
furlough program was suspended and later reinstated with tightened
restrictions.

   A federal judge awarded more than $2.7
million in damages Wednesday to the family of a father and son who
perished when a small plane collided with an Aeromexico jet over
Southern California in 1986.
   It was the second case to result in a damage award to relatives
of people killed in the disaster, which claimed 82 lives.
   U.S. District Judge Manuel L. Real ruled the family was entitled
to $2,733,666 in compensation for economic and personal losses due
to the deaths of Joe Guzman, 45, and his son Robert, 18.
   Joe Guzman's daughter Reann, 5, was awarded $427,254 of the
damages.
   The Norwalk truck driver and his son were on the Aeromexico jet
returning to Los Angeles from a fishing vacation in Baja California
when the jet collided with a small private plane and crashed into
suburban Cerritos.
   The death toll totaled 67 people in the aircraft and 15 people
in the neighborhood 20 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
   In the first case, a different judge awarded about $1.3 million
to a San Jose man who lost his wife and son in the crash. Dozens of
similar cases to determine damages are pending.
   The lawsuits are based upon the decision of a federal jury that
last April blamed the crash equally on the government, through the
actions of an air-traffic controller, and on William Kramer, the
pilot of the small plane.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union for the first time has admitted
responsibility for the massacre of thousands of Polish prisoners in
the Katyn forest during World War II, the British Broadcasting
Corp. reported Friday.
   Until now, the Soviet Union has blamed the 1940 massacre of
15,000 Polish Army officers and soldiers near the western town
Smolensk on Nazi Germany.
   The formal admission of guilt coincides with the three-day state
visit of Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski, who is scheduled to
visit Katyn Saturday. The acknowledgement of responsibility for the
slaying has been one of the conditions for improvement in relations
between Poland and the Soviet Union.
   A BBC World Service radio news bulletin quoted Radio Moscow as
saying recently discovered documents determined the crime was
carried out by the Soviet NKVD, predecessors of the KGB secret
police.
   The BBC quoted the official radio as describing the massacre as
one of the worst outrages of the Stalinist era in the Soviet Union
and said Radio Moscow expressed deep regret for the atrocity.
   The Katyn area, where the bodies of more than 4,000 Polish
offiders were found in a mass grave, changed hands as the war
progressed, first being under Soviet control and then Nazi control.
   The victims were prisoners of war captured in the Nazi-Soviet
partition of Poland at the start of the war. The Poles had been
interned after the Soviets invaded Poland in 1939.
   The killings eliminated some of most talented officers in
Poland, and for years has been a source of deep resentment for
Poles who until August were under Communist rule. The government is
now under rule of the Solidarity tradue union movement.
   The crime was first disclosed in 1943 by the Nazis, who
attributed it to the NKVD.

<HEAD>Culture Minister Says New U.S. Visa Rules Will Harm Foreign
Artists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Culture Minister Jack Lang has denounced a new U.S.
immigration rule, saying it will soon be easier for foreign artists
and performers to work in Moscow than New York.
   Lang was referring to a regulation, which took effect Feb. 26,
requiring foreign artists who wish to work temporarily in the
United States to show ``proof of their commercial success or
international fame'' to obtain the desirable H1 visa.
   ``Under the new rule, Vincent van Gogh would be denied access to
American territory,'' Lang told reporters at a news conference.
   ``The ruling means that as far as cultural exchange is
concerned, Moscow is more accessible than Los Angeles or New
York,'' he said.
   A second category of visas, called H2s, are issued on a regular
basis to ordinary alien workers. But Lang said the procedure for
obtaining them is much slower and more complicated, making it
difficult for performers to arrange their schedules.
   The U.S. Embassy in Paris issued a statement saying no laws
concerning H1 or H2 have been changed.
   ``The new regulations issued on Feb. 26 were simply a
clarification of existing laws. There has been a long tradition of
cultural exchange between France and the United States and we trust
that a continuing spirit of cooperation and mutual respect will
resolve any problems that may arise,'' the statement said.
   In a recent commentary in Billboard magazine, American
immigration lawyer Jeffrey Gabel said there were fears in the
United States that the new rule would hinder foreign artists who
are not superstars.
   ``The effects of this action could narrow the chances of foreign
artists and entertainers and their support staffs to enter the
United States,'' Gabel wrote.
   Lang cited several examples of artists _ famous in France but
not superstars in the minds of U.S. immigration officers _ who have
been denied H1 visas.
   They include film maker Elie Chouraqui and the rock group
``Niagara,'' which was forced to cancel performances in Baltimore,
Chicago and Washington this year after failing to get visas.
   Lang said Niagara's musicians were asked by immigration
officials to ``show proof of their usefulness to the American
public.'''
   Chouraqui, Lang said, received a visa only after weeks of
waiting and the intervention of Lang, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac
and finally, Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture
Association of America.
   Lang called the new rule ``unacceptable'' and urged the United
States to modify it as quickly as possible to ``ensure the free
circulation of artists worldwide.''
   ``In France, all artists are welcome,'' he said during Tuesdays
news conference, adding that French work permits for foreign
artists are ``simple, rapid, certain, free, and almost automatic.''
   Lang said he would discuss the issue with his colleagues at the
May 13 meeting of European Cabinet ministers. He urged the
formation of a Franco-American committee of artists to promote
freedom of movement.

<HEAD>Ailing Marcus Aurelius Doomed to Indoor Life _ For Now</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marcus Aurelius and his noble horse are back on the
Capitoline Hill but the triumph was bittersweet _ pollution has
forced the gilded bronze statue to abandon its glorious marble
perch above the heart of Rome.
   The 1,800-year-old statue was removed nine years ago for
cleaning and shoring up. It was taken from the Campidoglio, the
municipal square crowning the Capitoline, one of Rome's seven hills.
   There it had rested upon a marble pedestal, designed by
Michelangelo, the Renaissance genius who also laid out the square.
   After six years of examination, analyses and fund-raising,
experts wielding lasers, scalpels and brushes began actual
restoration in the spring of 1987. The team brought back some shine
to the imperial toga and saddle, but it was soon clear that no
technology existed to protect the treasure from the ravages of
pollution and vibration in traffic-filled Rome.
   Tests also showed that the weather is too humid for the
19-foot-high monument.
   So the restored Stoic emperor and his steed could not return to
the spot Michelangelo chose for them. Instead, they were installed
Wednesday in a room, its temperature and humidity carefully
controlled, in one of the palaces atop the hill that houses the
Capitoline Museums.
   In abandoning outdoor life, Marcus Aurelius has illustrious
company.
   In Florence, the gilded panels on the east entrance to the
cathedral's baptistry _ a door so beautiful Michelangelo thought it
was fit for paradise _ are destined for specially sealed chambers
in a museum.
   The four gilded bronze horses on the facade of St. Mark's in
Venice were installed inside the church after restoration.
   Research is under way for a coating that would protect the
Marcus Aurelius statue from the corrosive atmosphere and allow the
emperor to take his place again in the square.
   Meanwhile, the city is debating whether to put a replica atop
the pedestal.
   Anna Sommella, director of archaeology for the Capitoline
Museums, says leaving the pedestal empty could remind the public of
the price it is paying for polluted air.
   ``A remedy must be found for the square and for all of Rome,''
she said as she watched workers unload Marcus Aurelius off a truck
and push the upper half of the two-ton monument slowly into the
museum.
   Past city administrations have tried with little success to
limit traffic in the historic center. Current Mayor Franco Carraro,
a Socialist, was clearly ill at ease when asked what he could do
about the problem.
   ``We can't go backward. Even if we remove traffic, there are
other kinds of pollution, heating fuels, industry. We can't be
utopian in facing the problem,'' said Carraro.
   Romans would rather brave the four daily rush hours and
inadequate parking than risk chancy public bus and streetcar
service. Recurrent discoveries of underground relics have defeated
ambitious subway plans.
   Moving Marcus to the museum from the Central Restoration
Institute at San Michele, a former monastery across the Tiber from
City Hall, created its own traffic jam. Two flatbed trucks
transported the statue.
   The emperor, his arm outstretched, led the way. His horse, one
front leg suspended in a graceful curve, followed.
   The public will be allowed inside the museum to see the statue
as of April 21, the anniversary of Rome's founding.
   Legend has it that when the statue's gilding disappears, Rome
will cease to exist. Most of the gold coating, cleaned in
restoration, has been added over the centuries in previous
restoration; only a few specks are original.
   The work is the only known large equestrian statue surviving
from ancient imperial days. Others were destroyed after
Christianity came to Rome.
   Historians believe Marcus Aurelius' statue survived because it
was mistakenly identified as representing Constantine the Great,
the Christian emperor.
   It was originally placed near the Lateran palace, which had been
a papal residence. Pope Paul III ordered it removed to the
Capitoline Hill in 1538.

<HEAD>Astronomers Name Four Asteroids After Beatles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers used to name asteroids after
classic Greek and Roman figures. Times change.
   Two Lowell Observatory astronomers have named four asteroids
Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr.
   Brian Skiff and Edward Bowell have been Beatles fans for years.
So the names seemed natural for the asteroids, discovered in 1983
and 1984 during a photographic survey of the asteroid belt between
Mars and Jupiter.
   ``We thought it would be kind of nice to honor people who don't
usually get recognized in space,'' said Bowell, a native of England.
   He said most asteroids now are named after eminent astronomers
or scientists, although Harvard Observatory astronomers in
Massachusetts named one after rock guitarist Eric Clapton.
   Bowell said asteroid finders have the right to name their
discoveries, abiding by a code which permits almost any name except
those of politicians or religious figures. Skiff and Bowell have
named about 250 asteroids, including Shakespeare, Michelangelo, and
Sagan (for Carl Sagan).
   The newly named asteroids range from five to 10 miles in
diameter, which is typical, Bowell said. They are among 4,461
asteroids whose positions are accurately known.

   Give us your tired, your poor, your
huddled masses _ but make sure they have $3 to park.
   Free parking for people heading to the Statue of Liberty will
become history in May, when the fee takes effect at the ferry lots
in Liberty State Park, said Bernard Hartnett, chairman of the
park's Public Advisory Commission. The exact date for the change
was not set.
   The plan will affect 550 car spaces and 20 bus spots at the
park, Hartnett said this week. The fee for cars will be $3, and
commercial buses will pay $20 for a space. School buses and
visitors with a state park, handicapped or senior citizen pass will
be exempt.
   A ferry runs from a dock near the parking lot to the statue in
New York Harbor. The National Park Service says 426,308 people took
the ferry out to the statue in 1989.
   The advisory commission said the revenues will be used to build
another parking lot next to a science museum at the 800-acre park.

   Reports of the death of Garry Shandling's
character on the final ``It's Garry Shandling's Show'' are
premature.
   The last show's theme is death _ Shandling's, specifically. And
though the lead character is killed off, in the tradition of
television series endings, there is a surprise.
   In its inevitable style, ``It's Garry Shandling's Show'' ends
with Shandling talking right to viewers at home.
   ``People always say, `Is it your show or is it your life?'''
Shandling says to the camera. ``This is just a show.''
   The final episode of the show, which made its debut four years
ago on the Showtime cable network, is slated for telecast on June 1.
   ``We both made this decision a long time ago,'' co-creator and
producer Alan Zweibel said during a taping of the final show
Tuesday. ``It's time to try something else.''

   Kurt Masur, a leader in the democracy movement
in East Germany and a conductor of the Gewandhaus Orchestra of
Leipzig, has been named the New York Philharmonic's music director.
   The orchestra announced Wednesday that Masur, 62, will replace
Zubin Mehta, who told the Philharmonic in November 1988 that he
would leave as music director after the 1990-91 season.
   Masur's appointment is for five years and begins in the 1992-93
season, the Philharmonic's 150th anniversary season. He will
conduct for 14 weeks that season and spend four weeks in New York
in other activities.
   For the 1991-92 season, Masur will be ``music director
designate,'' Stephen Stamas, chairman of the New York Philharmonic
Society, said at a news conference.
   Stamas said he believes Masur will ``maintain a healthy interest
in what is going on in Germany, while his interests will be largely
musical.''
   Masur was born July 18, 1927, in Brieg, Silesia, now in Poland.
He studied at the music college of Leipzig. From 1960 to 1964 he
was senior director of music at Berlin's Komische Oper and from
1967 to 1972 was chief conductor of the Dresden Philharmonic.
   Stamas said that Masur will remain principal conductor of the
Gewandhaus Orchestra through the 1993-94 season, its 250th
anniversary, and will maintain some association there.

<HEAD>Study: Doctors Who Profit From Tests Order More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors' decisions to give tests or take X-rays
depend in part on how much money they make on them, a study today
says.
   The research supports the widely held but hard to document idea
that doctors' own financial interests play a role in determining
the kind and amount of care they give their patients.
   ``As in most professions, money matters,'' said David Hemenway,
a Harvard School of Public Health economist who directed the study.
   The report, in today's New England Journal of Medicine, measured
what happened when a chain of walk-in clinics changed the way it
paid its doctors. Instead of a flat hourly wage, doctors could earn
a percentage of all the fees they generated.
   With this financial incentive, they boosted the number of tests
and X-rays they performed by about 20 percent.
   The study was conducted in 1984 and 1985 at Boston-area offices
of Health Stop, the nation's biggest chain of walk-in clinics with
80 centers in six states.
   Nationwide, about 4,000 of these clinics have opened in the past
decade. They specialize in quick care for routine health
complaints, such as sprains and colds.
   Dr. Mark Shankman, Health Stop's chief executive officer,
contended that the study was too small and flawed to draw
conclusions. But he agreed that financial incentives can influence
the way doctors work.
   Patients' needs differ, and doctors honestly disagree over how
much _ or how little _ care is enough, especially when an extra
test or two may rule out some remotely possible problem.
   The new study suggests that when such uncertainty exists,
doctors may pile on the tests if they also profit from running up
the bill.
   ``There is a lot of leeway in what you can do,'' said Hemenway,
``and when there are financial incentives, some physicians change a
little how they behave in their practice patterns.''
   During the period studied, doctors were still guaranteed
payments of $28 to $32 per hour, depending on their age and
experience. But if their patients' bills were high enough, they
received part of the gross receipts instead of their hourly pay.
They had the opportunity to keep 24 percent of the first $24,000 of
their patients' monthly charges and 15 percent after that.
   The researchers compared the behavior of 15 doctors during
three-month periods before and after the bonus system. Overall,
they performed 23 percent more X-rays and 16 percent more tests
after they became eligible for bonuses.
   Their total charges per month, adjusted for inflation, grew 20
percent. Seven of the 15 doctors regularly earned bonuses, and
their pay rose 19 percent.
   The study did not attempt to learn whether patients benefited or
suffered from the extra medical care.
   ``The implication is that part of the way doctors make decisions
is the way they are paid,'' said Suzanne B. Cashman, a co-author of
the study and a health services researcher at the Boston University
Health Policy Institute.
   Shankman cited several shortcomings in the study besides the
small number of doctors reviewed. Among them:
   _Even before the bonus system began, the chain had a
profit-sharing program that provided a financial incentive to do
more.
   _A widely used sore throat test became available during the
study period, and this could have accounted for some of the
additional testing.
   _One of the doctors studied had a sharp increase in X-ray use
because he transferred to an office where he concentrated on
occupational medicine, which requires frequent X-rays to diagnose
work-related injuries.
   The latest study is part of a much larger examination of medical
practices, patient satisfaction and physician attitudes at Health
Stop.
   ``A lot of them said they didn't like it because of the pressure
for money, money, money,'' said Hemenway of former and current
Health Stop doctors. ``They felt it was a problem.''

<HEAD>Voters Fickle in Judging Candidates' Past Drug Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Ann Richards overcame allegations of
drug abuse to win the gubernatorial nomination in Texas, but
analysts say voters can be fickle about judging politicians with
drugs in their past.
   Age, sex and the drug of choice all may have something to do
with it, they say. And so can the candidate's opponent.
   Accusations of drug abuse and related character attacks so
dominated the four-week Texas gubernatorial runoff between Ms.
Richards and state Attorney General Jim Mattox that one commentator
said the contest had sunk from the gutters to the sewers.
   But the same issue created few ripples in Massachusetts, where
11 politicians last month admitted they had tried marijuana. And
similar admissions appeared to play no role in the losing 1988
presidential campaigns of Democrats Bruce Babbitt and Al Gore.
   Just last week, the Senate approved Timothy Ryan as the nation's
chief savings and loan regulator after senators displayed little
concern that he had tried marijuana and cocaine while in law school.
   In Texas, Mattox pursued Ms. Richards relentlessly on the drug
issue after she refused to say whether she had used illegal drugs.
   ``Did she use marijuana? Or something worse, like cocaine? Not
as a college kid, but as a 47-year-old elected official sworn to
uphold the law,'' Mattox asked in one television ad. Later he
alleged outright that Ms. Richards, the state treasurer, once had a
cocaine addiction. But by the end, he, too, was fighting off drug
use allegations.
   Still to be seen is whether the drug issue will dog Richards in
her general election contest against Republican Clayton Williams.
Analysts say there are many potential difficulties, starting with
her age. At 56, she is substantially older than the generation
usually associated with and excused for experimental drug use.
   ``Anything you did before 25 is to be forgiven,'' even if it was
only 10 years ago, said Democratic consultant Tony Podesta. ``But
if you indulged your drug fantasies when you were 47, it sounds a
lot different.''
   The issue also is harder to overcome for women, analysts said,
because people generally tolerate freewheeling behavior more easily
in men than in women. In Ms. Richards' case, they note, the
allegations also contrast sharply with the grandmotherly image she
tried to project in her ads.
   The particular drug at issue also matters with voters.
   William Schneider, a political analyst at the American
Enterprise Institute, said occasional or infrequent marijuana use,
``if not forgiven, is at least understood'' by voters, but cocaine
is a different story.
   ``If it was only marijuana, she would have said so,'' Schneider
said. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, told voters she had used no
``mood-altering'' chemicals in the past 10 years, but refused to
say what, if any, drugs she had used previously.
   Ms. Richards won anyway, but analysts said the Texas race was a
flawed test of whether voters will be forgiving of past drug use.
   Charles Cook, editor of Cook's Political Report, cited Mattox's
attack-dog style, his failure to release his income tax returns and
the last-minute allegations that he had smoked marijuana.
   ``It wasn't a situation where you had allegations about drug use
by one candidate and the other candidate seemed pure as the driven
snow,'' Cook said.
   ``Both candidates ended up with high negatives'' because of the
drug issue, said Jill Buckley, a Democratic communications
consultant.
   Buckley and others said voters found Ms. Richards the less
offensive candidate because she started the race with a reputation
for decency and there was a sense she was being unfairly hammered
on drugs.
   In contrast with Texas, Ryan's law school experiments with
marijuana and cocaine, recounted in a leaked FBI report, were all
but ignored when the Senate confirmed him last week to head the
Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Senators were quick to condemn the leak and defend the nominee _
mostly on the grounds of his age, which is 44.
   Whatever Ryan did ``ended 17 years ago,'' said Sen. Bob Dole,
R-Kan. ``If he is to be held up to that standard, then we are going
to wipe out a generation of men and women who are about that age,
who may have experimented at one time or another with some type of
drug.''
   Podesta said some of the same dynamics were at work in
Massachusetts when a crowd of politicians _ including a senator,
two congressmen and five candidates for state office _ confessed to
past dalliances with drugs. The public appeared to respond with a
mass ``so what.''
   ``You have a younger generation of politicians, a more liberal
social atmosphere heavily influenced by the academic community,''
Podesta said.

   President Bush is refusing to recognize
Lithuania's breakaway government, fearing a replay of 1956 when the
United States rooted for Hungary's uprising but stayed on the
sidelines as Soviet tanks crushed the revolt, his spokesman says.
   Bush, in a meeting with Baltic-Americans on Wednesday, rejected
their plea for U.S. recognition of Lithuania as independent from
the Soviet Union.
   The Baltic-Americans told the president that Lithuania is only
the beginning of Soviet troubles. They said separatist movements
will be boiling over in Latvia and Estonia by the time Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrives here for his summit with
Bush at the end of May.
   ``The Latvians will be declaring independence in two weeks.
Estonia is in the same process. By the time we get to the summit,
we will have a situation in all three republics which is comparable
to what is happening today'' in Lithuania, said Ojars Kalnins of
the American Latvian Association.
   But White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush's
policy on Lithuania ``is the correct one and it does not involve
recognition.''
   He said the president wants to ``avoid taking actions that would
inadvertently make Lithuania's task more difficult by inflaming the
situation.''
   Bush, he said, mentioned Hungary in 1956 ``as an example of the
situation that he wanted to avoid, a situation in which the United
States supported the protest there and the movement there, and then
the Soviet Union put it down by force and we were unable to do
anything in support of our convictions.''
   ``And he indicated that he did not want to precipitate a
situation in which that would create the use of force or that ...
similarly would cause us to be unable to act,'' Fitzwater said.
   The president has consistently voiced support for Lithuania's
independence move because the United States never officially
recognized the Soviet Union's 1940 annexation of the three Baltic
republics.
   But even as he has warned Gorbachev that a crackdown or
repression in Lithuania would harm a range of U.S.-Soviet
relations, Bush has refrained from harsh criticism in favor of
repeatedly calling for dialogue and peaceful resolution.
   Bush also has pointed out that Gorbachev deserves credit for
allowing the democratic reforms in Eastern Europe and changes
within the Soviet Union.
   He said as much to the Baltic-Americans on Wednesday, crediting
Gorbachev's policies with allowing ``the atmosphere whereby
Lithuania could consider its future in a different light because of
glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring),'' said
Fitzwater.
   The Baltic-Americans said they were disappointed that Bush was
unwilling to recognize the government of Lithuanian President
Vytautas Landsbergis or to give ``de facto'' recognition, a step
short of official recognition.
   Mari-Ann Rikken of the Estonian-American National Council
characterized the president as looking ``to find a way out, a way
out of the Soviet Union for the Baltic states that will not result
in a cataclysm for the Soviet Union and that will not result in a
blood bath for the Baltic states.''
   Fitzwater said Bush ``pointed out in forceful terms that the
United States approaches this problem with many ramifications to
consider.''
   Lithuania and Hungary are not exactly parallel situations.
Lithuania is trying to secede from the Soviet Union, while Hungary
was an independent country under Soviet influence. Its government
was seen as a Soviet puppet, and when anti-communist revolts began
in 1956, the Soviet Union quickly and violently quashed them.

   The Bush administration is preparing a
proposal to ease restrictions on sales of high-technology items to
the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe, but the changes likely
will not go far enough to satisfy Western allies.
   Commerce Undersecretary Dennis Kloske, who supervises export
control activities, said Wednesday there was growing agreement in
the administration over the actions needed to provide Western
technology to the struggling economies of Poland, Hungary and other
former communist bloc countries.
   The administration is conducting a review, and recommendations
on what changes can be made without jeopardizing national security
should be presented to President Bush by the end of this month,
Kloske said.
   ``There is an emerging consensus inside the administration that
the changing developments in Eastern Europe will allow for a
significant level of streamlining'' of export controls, Kloske told
business executives attending a U.S. Chamber of Commerce trade
seminar.
   Speaking to reporters later, Kloske said the administration
strongly believes the Soviet Union should not be allowed access to
the same level of technology being offered to other East European
nations.
   The administration also is insisting that Eastern European
countries sign agreements that guarantee that the high-technology
products would not fall into Soviet hands. Such agreements also
would provide for on-site inspection by Western officials.
   Kloske said the new governments of East Germany, Poland,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria have indicated a willingness
to adopt enforcement programs to meet U.S. demands.
   U.S. allies, especially West Germany, believe the administration
is still being too restrictive. The allies have been pushing for
even more liberalization on exports to Eastern Europe and many
believe the Soviets also should be allowed access to Western
high-tech products as a way of supporting President Mikhail
Gorbachev's economic reforms.
   But Kloske said the situation in the Soviet Union was still too
volatile. Other administration officials have said the Soviet
crackdown in Lithuania may have strengthened the administration's
bargaining position.
   ``The Soviets are not going to receive preferential treatment
overnight or any time soon,'' Kloske predicted.
   Sales of high-technology products to the Soviet Union and
countries in the Eastern Bloc are regulated by the Coordinating
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls. The 17-nation COCOM
group is composed of America's West European allies and Japan and
Australia.
   COCOM was created during the Cold War to make sure that
technology with military uses did not fall into communist hands.
The United States has lately found itself isolated in the
organization, resisting demands for much swifter relaxation of
export controls.
   The Paris-based COCOM is scheduled to take up rules changes
again during a June 7-8 meeting and Kloske said that session could
well decide the fate of the entire export review process.
   ``If we cannot reach agreement in June, we begin to run a
serious risk that the allies will begin shipping (to East Europe)
on their own,'' he said.
   The administration is reviewing a proposal that would provide
Eastern European countries with the same level of technology that
is now being sold to China in the areas of computers, machine tools
and telecommunications equipment.
   Earlier this week, the Soviet Union made a strong bid to the
West to rethink its position on blocking Soviet access to the
technology the country needs to modernize its economy.
   Stepan Sitarian, a deputy Soviet premier, told a conference in
Bonn, West Germany, that the Soviets would be willing to agree to
inspection procedures so the West could verify that high-technology
equipment was not being used for military purposes.
   Kloske said the administration might be willing to consider
liberalizing technology shipments to the Soviets in ``clearly
civilian, non-strategic areas'' such as agriculture or textiles.

<HEAD>Events in Eastern Europe Chilling Arms Control Talks, Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arms control progress is being chilled by the
collapse of the Soviet position in Eastern Europe, the unsettling
prospect of a united Germany and unrest in three Baltic republics,
four specialists say.
   Assessing last week's inconclusive talks between Soviet Foreign
Minister Euard A. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, the arms control advocates agreed there was ``little
progress and some regression'' on key issues in strategic and
conventional talks.
   ``I think the main reason has been the shock effect of the
events in Eastern Europe and East Germany on Soviet thinking,''
former arms control negotiator John Dean told reporters.
   While the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, talks
should have no logical connection with events in Eastern Europe,
``there's bound to be something of a psychic impact,'' Dean said.
   The negotiating climate also has been complicated by the U.S.
suggestion of moving quickly to ban mobile, land-based,
multiple-warhead missiles, the experts said.
   ``To open up the MIRV (multiple-warhead) issue now means there
will not be an early START treaty,'' said Spurgeon Keeney,
president of the privately funded Arms Control Association.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev open
their summit meeting in Washington on May 30, but Keeney said:
``There is no chance there will be a (START) agreement by the time
of the summit and the main problem now is if there can even be an
agreement in principle by then.''
   But Keeney and the others gave Bush high marks for continuing to
emphasize the importance of reaching agreements with Moscow despite
political pressure for him to more aggressively support Lithuania's
recent declaration of independence.
   Also addressing the arms control issue were Paul Warnke, former
director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and Jack
Mendelsohn, the Arms Control Association's deputy director.
   Keeney said that while both Bush and Gorbachev clearly want arms
control agreements as quickly as possible, an apparent earlier
consensus on how to deal with such strategic weapons as
air-launched and sea-launched cruise missiles now appears to have
been premature.
   The Soviets are raising serious questions on how to verify each
side's declarations about the nature of such weapons, including
their range and whether they are armed with conventional or nuclear
warheads, Keeney said.
   Warnke said he believes the consideration of a ban on multiple
warheads on missiles should await a second phase of the START talks.
   ``If we do want START I, we shouldn't throw this particular
wrinkle in,'' he said.
   Warnke said there has been ``a toughening in the Soviet
position'' overall.
   Some suggest this is due to ``the Baltic chill'' caused by
Soviet efforts to quell the independence movement in Lithuania and
the simultaneous moves toward independence in neighboring Estonia
and Latvia, he said.
   ``The state of superpower relations does have an impact on
negotiations,'' Warnke said, and added: ``There is speculation that
the Soviet military is taking more of a role out of concern over
the concessions their negotiators have made to date.''
   But he said others feel the Soviets are just employing ``good
negotiating tactics'' as the START talks near their end.
   Dean said there also has been a recent slowdown by the Soviets
in the Vienna talks aimed at reducing conventional forces and arms
in Central Europe.
   Progress on most issues is ``hanging fire'' and there is major
difficulty on the issue of reducing Soviet and Western aircraft,
said Dean, who now is arms control adviser to the Union of
Concerned Scientists.
   Soviet negotiators have not been receiving fresh instructions,
Dean said. He said reasons for the delay include Soviet leaders'
preoccupation with other issues, the hardening of Soviet positions
and ``the collapse of the Soviet position in Eastern Europe and in
East Germany.''
   Keeney said part of the blame may rest with unrealistic U.S.
expectations after a series of Soviet arms control concessions.
   ``While it may be correct that the Soviets have dug in their
heels, it's also true that the United States had reached the
conclusion that the Soviets would accept any reasonable proposal we
put forward,'' Dean added. ``That may have been unreasonable.''
   Mendelsohn suggested there may be little progress on reducing
conventional forces in Central Europe ``until the Soviets know what
will happen'' in a united Germany.

<HEAD>Scientists Uncover Genetic Details From 20-Million-Year-Old Tree</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Researchers have uncovered details of a gene
from a magnolia tree that lived in Idaho about 20 million years
ago, by far the oldest plant or animal tissue ever to yield that
information.
   The genetic material came from leaf samples that were
exceptionally well preserved by an ancient lake, researchers
reported today in the British journal Nature.
   Such analysis can shed light on the relationships between
extinct species and their present-day descendants, helping
researchers construct the scientific equivalent of family trees.
   The new report demonstrates ``an opportunity to take a new
technology and apply it to the study of ... classical problems in
biology,'' said study co-author Michael Clegg of the University of
California at Riverside.
   He did the work with postdoctoral student Edward Golenberg and
others at the university, and scientists at the University of
Georgia in Athens, the University of Idaho in Moscow and the DNAX
Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif.
   The leaf samples, from an excavation in the panhandle area of
northern Idaho, were from 17 million to 20 million years old.
   The oldest material that previously had yielded to similar
genetic analysis was human brain tissue about 7,000 years old,
recovered from a bog in Florida, Clegg said in a recent telephone
interview.
   Genetic material, called deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA, was
extracted from leaf samples and a part of it was duplicated
repeatedly using a technique called polymerase chain reaction.
Researchers determined its chemical makeup, and found that the DNA
was from a gene that acted as a blueprint for part of a particular
plant protein.
   ``The fact that we could do it once probably means it can be
done again'' with materials from other sites, Clegg said.
   The leaf samples were exceptionally well preserved, having
fallen into a cold lake that rapidly silted in. The cold and the
low amounts of oxygen available helped preserve the leaves, he said.
   It is unclear how many other sites could offer such
well-preserved specimens for DNA analysis, he said.
   But the new report suggests the Idaho site itself may provide
``an extraordinarily well-preserved assemblage of fossils'' that
could yield an abundance of information, much like the famed La
Brea pits, said Karl Niklas, botany professor at Cornell University
in Ithaca.
   The La Brea pits in Los Angeles are one of the world's richest
known sources of Ice Age fossils.
   Clegg said DNA work has begun with other leaves from the site.
   The site contained remnants of more than 100 species of plants.
Perhaps half were preserved in somewhat the same way as the
magnolia leaves, and DNA might be recovered from some of them, said
study co-author Charles Smiley of the University of Idaho.
   The site also contained 30 to 40 kinds of insects, some of which
still had their original colors, and four kinds of fish, he said.
But it is unclear what their potential for DNA analysis would be,
he said.
   Niklas said that if other remains from the same site could be
made to reveal genetic details, it would reveal ``an unique slice
through time, based on DNA analysis ... That's an extremely
exciting possibility.''

   An experimental AIDS drug injected into two
pregnant monkeys reached their fetuses, raising hope that it might
block AIDS virus infection of human babies by their mothers,
scientists said today.
   If used early enough in pregnancy, it might ward off perinatal
AIDS infection, said study co-author Daniel Capon of Genentech Inc.
of South San Francisco.
   The drug reached the fetuses about as easily as a human mother's
natural proteins do as they build up disease resistance within
babies, researchers said.
   The drug, called a CD4 immunoadhesin, has shown promise against
the AIDS virus in the test tube, but its effectiveness in people is
not yet known.
   The standard AIDS drug AZT can also reach fetuses, crossing the
placenta ``quite well,'' said James Balsley of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
   Researchers are testing AZT's safety in pregnant women and plan
to test whether it can block perinatal transmission of the AIDS
virus, he said Wednesday.
   Some 1,734 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in
infants who were infected by their mothers have been recorded by
the federal Centers for Disease Control. Scientists do not know
details of how babies are infected, but many infections appear to
happen during pregnancy, with some during birth.
   A child born to an AIDS-infected woman runs a 20 percent to 40
percent risk of being infected by the mother, studies suggest.
   The new work is reported in today's issue of the British journal
Nature by Capon and others at Genentech, and Jerome Groopman and
colleagues at Harvard Medical School and New England Deaconess
Hospital in Boston.
   The immunoadhesin they studied is a man-made hybrid of parts of
two natural proteins. One protein, called CD4, is found on the
surface of some cells in the body. The other protein, an
immunoglobulin, plays a key role in the body's disease-fighting
immune system.
   The new study and previous research show that in the test tube,
immunoadhesins can block the AIDS virus from infecting cells, and
can trigger the killing of infected cells while leaving healthy
cells alone.
   To test the drug's ability to cross the placenta, researchers
injected two rhesus monkeys near the end of their gestational
periods with immunoadhesins and then infused more drug for 24 hours
before performing Caesarian sections.
   Blood from the newborns contained about 3 percent of the
concentration of immunoadhesins that their mothers' blood had,
researchers reported. Other experiments have shown that natural
maternal immunoglobulins reach human fetuses at about the same
rate, study authors said.
   With maternal immunoglobulins, Capon said, the fetal level
builds up over time. A similar accumulation of immunoadhesins might
occur if the drug is given early enough in pregnancy, he said.
   Gwendolyn Scott of the University of Miami School of Medicine,
who is studying perinatal AIDS virus infection, called the
immunoadhesin idea ``an exciting concept in terms of perhaps
another way that perinatal transmission might be interrupted.''
   Questions about safety of the fetus would have to be studied,
she said in a telephone interview.

   A projected increase of up to 50 percent in
average global concentrations of the pollutant ozone over the next
30 years would make little difference in U.S. cities with an ozone
problem, a scientist says.
   About 100 areas in the United States fail to meet federal
standards for ozone levels, including essentially all major cities,
according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
   But the projected global average increase would have only a
minor impact on American cities because local pollution is the main
cause of their ozone troubles, said scientist Brian Ridley of the
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
   Ozone is a form of oxygen that plays a Jekyll-and-Hyde role in
the atmosphere. At high altitudes it shields Earth from solar rays
that can promote skin cancer. But near the Earth's surface it is a
pollutant that irritates sensitive lung tissues and harms crops.
   Low-altitude ozone is created by nitrogen oxides and
hydrocarbons that come from automobile exhaust and industrial
sources.
   Ridley was commenting on a study in today's issue of the British
journal Nature that projected an increase of 21 percent to 50
percent in average global levels of low-altitude ozone by the year
2020.
   He also cautioned that such projections are uncertain because of
lack of scientific knowledge about such factors as the distribution
of nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere.
   The increase dealt with concentrations at the Earth's surface,
over land only, study co-author Adrian Hough said in an interview.
He and Richard Derwent did the projections at the Harwell
Laboratory in Didcot, England.
   Hough said local ozone control measures may have to be more
stringent if the projected increase takes place, because local
ozone readings reflect this background level as well as local
pollution.
   One projection focused on latitudes typical of the central
United States. It found a rise in annual averages from about 30
parts per billion today to perhaps 35 parts or 45 parts per billion
in the year 2020, Hough said.
   Under EPA criteria, an area fails to comply with the ozone
standard if it exceeds 120 parts per billion for more than an
average of once a year over a three-year period.
   Hough said the main factor behind the calculated rise in overall
global ozone is increased emissions from industrialization and
automobile use in developing nations.

<HEAD>Student Loan Defaults Drop Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Department officials are reluctant
to predict a new trend in student loan defaults, but trade school
officials are claiming some credit for a 1.7 percentage point drop
in the rate.
   ``Our problem with student loan defaults is too serious for
hasty judgments about trends in the default rate,'' said Leonard L.
Haynes III, assistant secretary for postsecondary education. The
figures for fiscal year 1988, the latest available, are encouraging
but not yet decisive, he said.
   ``We want to evaluate these data thoroughly before we draw any
conclusions,'' Haynes said.
   Education Department data show the overall default rate dropped
to 15.6 percent in fiscal year 1988 from 17.3 percent in 1987. In
fiscal 1986, the default rate was 21 percent.
   For fiscal 1988, 385,000 borrowers who were supposed to begin
repaying defaulted on a total of $1.07 billion in loans, while 2.46
million borrowers entered repayment on guaranteed student loans
totaling $9.23 billion.
   In 1987, 2.23 million borrowers entered repayment, while
defaulted loans due that year totaled 398,000.
   Larry Oxendine, acting director of policy and program
development for the department, estimated the total of all
defaulted loans at about $10 billion. The government has lent about
$90 billion during the 25 years of the program.
   Stephen Blair, president of the National Association of Trade
and Technical Schools, said a ``quick scan'' of the department data
shows a significant drop in the number of defaults of trade school
loans.
   Trade and other proprietary schools have been blamed in recent
years for the spiraling student loan default rates. Some have been
accused of using unscrupulous recruiting tactics to lure students
to the schools just so they can get the federal money.
   ``We began a major national initiative four years ago (to reduce
loan defaults at private career schools) and out of that we believe
the reduction is due in part to our efforts,'' said Blair.
   Haynes said many factors contributed to the reduction in the
overall default rate, including increased school default prevention
efforts, a dramatic increase in the number of Supplemental Loans to
Students entering repayment, plus technical changes in the
calculations.
   According to Haynes, more than half of the total reduction came
through excluding foreign schools or those with fewer than 30
borrowers, as well as institutions that are defunct, unaccredited
or have withdrawn from the program.
   Of the 5,226 institutions tracked by the Education Department,
more than 70 percent had default rates under 20 percent, Haynes
said. Schools whose former students' default rates are above 20
percent must establish default management plans approved and
monitored by the department.
   As an institution's default rate goes higher, additional
measures are required, including a 30-day delay in release of loan
funds to first-time borrowers and pro-rata tuition refunds.
   Beginning in 1991, schools with default rates above 60 percent
are subject to expulsion from the federal student aid programs.
   Roberta Dunn, deputy assistant education secretary for student
financial assistance, said 1,127 institutions with default rates of
between 20 percent and 40 percent submitted management plans last
year that were eventually approved. An additional 482 schools have
rates higher than 40 percent.
   Institutions with defaults of 70 percent or higher include Tom
Nolan's Chrysler Academy School, Decatur, Ill., 75.9 percent,
defaults totaling $175,322; Cannella School of Hair Design,
Chicago, 73.4 percent, $420,440; Stevenson's Academy of Hair, New
Orleans, 75.8 percent, $108,057; Cambridge Technical Institute,
Dayton, Ohio, 81.5 percent, $8,282,384; and Eason's Institute of
Technology, San Antonio, 79.5 percent, $737,442.

<HEAD>Maoist Guerrillas Black Out Capital, Policeman Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minutes after Shining Path guerrillas knocked
out power to the capital once again, a Lima policeman was killed in
a car bombing.
   Dozens of explosions were heard throughout the city immediately
after the power was cut Wednesday night. The blackout affected
cities and towns along 560 miles of the coast.
   The car bomb that killed the policeman exploded on one of Lima's
main avenues in front of a private club that police frequent,
Lima's top radio station reported.
   Almost simultaneously, six people were injured in a blast at the
downtown offices of the University of San Martin, next to the Lima
Election Board, the station reported. Four people were arrested
immediately after the attack.
   A police spokesman said details of the bombings were not
available.
   Witnesses said fires in the shape of the hammer and sickle were
burning in the mountains outside blacked-out Lima.
   Guerrillas of the Maoist-inspired Shining Path frequently bomb
power pylons, leading authorities to devise elaborate means for
protecting them that have included high fences and land mines.
   The bombings and blackout came three days after the first round
of presidential elections. The elections sent novelist Mario Vargas
Llosa and political newcomer Alfredo Fujimori into a runoff that
will probably be held in early June.
   The Shining Path had announced plans to sabotage the elections,
and security was heavy, but little violence was reported in the
capital over the weekend.
   More than 18,000 people have been killed since the Shining Path
began its armed insurgency in 1980, the government says.

   The Army says an investigator will decide
whether a murder charge lodged against a paratrooper in connection
with the Panama invasion should be forwarded for a possible
court-martial.
   First Sgt. Roberto Enrique Bryan, a member of the 82nd Airborne
Division based at Fort Bragg, N.C., faces a charge of premeditated
murder of a Panamanian man and three counts of aggravated assault,
Army spokesman Maj. Joe Padilla said.
   It is the most serious action taken by Army officials against a
soldier in the aftermath of December's U.S. invasion of Panama,
Padilla said.
   The charges are expected to be referred to an investigating
officer, who will recommend whether the case should be forwarded to
Maj. Gen. James H. Johnson Jr., commander of the 82nd Airborne.
Johnson will decide whether a court-martial should be convened,
Army officials said.
   Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the maximum penalty
for premeditated murder is death or life imprisonment, dishonorable
discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances and reduction in
rank.
   Bryan, 42, was born in Panama and was sent there with the 82nd
Airborne in the Dec. 20 effort to oust Panamanian dictator Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, Padilla said.
   The soldier is not being held in detention and is being
represented by a military lawyer, the spokesman said.
   Bryan was the senior enlisted man in his unit, a headquarters
company. Such units were deployed to Panama to handle such things
as supply and organizational matters, Padilla said.
   The spokesman said Bryan is charged with the murder of an
unidentified Panamanian man, allegedly ``by shooting him with an
M-16 rifle on or about Dec. 23'' at or near Madden Dam, which is
outside Panama City.
   The three other charges allege aggravated assault against
unidentified Panamanian men at the same location.
   One case involved a man who allegedly was struck in the hand
with the butt of an M-16 rifle on or about Dec. 20, one man who
allegedly was struck in the head with the butt of an M-16 on or
about Dec. 20, and a man who allegedly was struck in the back with
a section of rubber hose on or about Dec. 21, the Army said.
   Although Padilla said he could not comment on the circumstances
surrounding the incidents, the Army Times newspaper reported
earlier this month that the shooting occurred after a skirmish at a
roadblock when a group of Panamanians were stopped in a car and
someone threw a hand grenade at the soldiers.
   The U.S. soldiers then fired on the car, killing some of the
occupants. The remaining occupants surrendered, got out and were
taken prisoner, but one of the prisoners allegedly was shot and
another severely beaten, the Army Times reported. The publication
is an independent weekly.
   The charges came about as a result of an investigation by the
U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, Padilla said.

<HEAD>Cancer Drug Studied in Sickle Cell Disease</HEAD>

   Doctors hope to reduce the complications of sickle
cell disease by prompting the body to produce a substance that it
ordinarily stops making after birth.
   The experimental treatment involves the drug hydroxyurea, a
medicine approved for treating melanoma and some other forms of
cancer.
   Sickle cell victims make defective hemoglobin, the substance in
red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. In the new
treatment, doctors induced the body to make fetal hemoglobin, which
ordinarily is present in large quantities only before birth.
   But the treatment only slightly reduced anemia, a common
complication of sickle cell disease. The doctors cautioned that
more study of the drug's long-term effects and hazards will be
necessary before they know whether it will play a role in treating
the ailment.
   The study was conducted by Dr. Griffin P. Rodgers and colleagues
from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. It was
published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   In seven of 10 people given the drug for three months, levels of
fetal hemoglobin in red blood cells rose by two to 10 times. This
resulted in a 25 percent reduction in the tendency of their
hemoglobin to polymerize, or form long fibers, which gives the red
cells a distorted shape.
   The doctors speculated that if they could achieve a 50 percent
reduction in the tendency to polymerize, they could significantly
reduce the complications of sickle cell disease.
   In the United States, the disease is most common among blacks,
where it occurs in about one of every 1,000 people.
   Doctors are also studying the possibility of using the cancer
drug to treat thalassemia, another inherited blood disorder.

Troops</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BITBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's call to remove
tens of thousands of American troops from West Germany has been
matched _ or surpassed _ by the increasing eagerness of West
Germans to see them go.
   Once scorned as ``anti-Americanism,'' the wish to see the
massive U.S. military presence sharply reduced has picked up the
support of two state governments.
   ``Before, people were reprimanded for saying such a thing out
loud,'' says Hans Jacobs, deputy mayor of Bitburg. He says ``now
the time has come'' to plan a future with a far smaller number of
U.S. troops.
   Bitburg, home to a U.S. Air Force base, is also the town where
former President Ronald Reagan made a bitterly criticized visit to
a German war cemetery in 1985.
   Jacobs says he looks forward to a possible civilian use for the
air base and less noise from fighter jets screeching overhead.
   ``Tourism would also pick up if there weren't so many troops
around,'' he said. Jacobs says the 13,500 Americans there outnumber
West Germans.
   President Bush's proposal to withdraw 57,000 of the
quarter-million American soldiers stationed in West Germany has
sparked political wrangling over which areas should be the first to
see substantial withdrawals.
   The activities of U.S. and other NATO troops have led to
numerous protests in recent years, especially as resistance grew to
``low-level'' training flights.
   The roaring flights wake children, shake houses, scare cows and
generally make life miserable for those in the training areas.
   Frequent military maneuvers also chew up farmers' fields and
lead to massive traffic jams on already crowded highways.
   Many West Germans have long chafed at such a massive U.S. troop
presence as an obstacle to full national sovereignty, and the
collapse of Communist regimes to the east now has them feeling less
threatened than ever.
   West German officials are even eyeing a U.S. pullout as a way to
open housing for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Eastern
Europe. The Social Democratic mayor of Frankfurt says he hopes to
turn a huge military shopping area into a city housing development.
   On Tuesday, Munich's Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily newspaper
reported that environmentalists have demanded the closing of a huge
Army practice range near the Bavarian city of Regensburg. They want
it turned into a nature preserve.
   Hesse state Gov. Walter Wallmann has made an outright appeal for
the removal of U.S. troops from Frankfurt and nearby Erbenheim.
   In a letter last week to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a fellow
Christian Democrat, Wallmann said the American facilities are
needed to keep up with ``European competition'' in economic areas.
   The Hesse governor told Kohl, a fellow Christian Democratic,
that he would even like to have the sprawling Rhein-Main U.S. Air
Base outside Frankfurt turned over to the West Germans.
   Wallmann's bluntly worded letter would have been unthinkable
just months ago from a member of the West German party with the
closest ties to Washington.
   Frankfurt is jockeying to become the home of the central bank of
an economically integrated Europe, thus attracting even more
business to the glittering financial center.
   The city's mayor, Volker Hauff, would like the Americans to give
up a huge shopping area, which includes a bustling Burger King
restaurant, to turn the site into a city housing development.
   Carl-Ludwig Wagner, the Christian Democratic governor of the
western state of Rhineland-Palatinate where Bitburg is located, is
also seeking U.S. troop cutbacks.
   Wagner has presented a list of 12 military U.S. bases and
facilities for possible closure.
   Most West Germans accept that U.S. troops will be stationed in
their country for some time, and many West Germans warn that the
financial impact of pullouts from smaller areas could be especially
severe.
   In Rhineland-Palatinate, U.S. bases contribute from $2.6 billion
to $4.1 billion annually to the state _ once one of West Germany's
poorest. About 68,000 American troops and 75,000 family members are
in the state, and 21,500 West Germans are in the employ of the
state's U.S. military facilities.
   NATO commander John R. Galvin has been making TV commercials for
the U.S. military to try to calm concerns about the future of U.S.
forces in West Germany, according to a military spokesman.
   ``There's a lot of rumors,'' said Army Maj. David Compton of the
U.S. military headquarters in Stuttgart.
   He said Galvin still has not made any formal troop cutback plan.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T to Begin Service to Albania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Telegraph &amp; Telephone Co. will
begin its first phone service from the United States to Albania
next month.
   The Albanian link will leave Vietnam, Cambodia and North Korea
as the only major nations without telephone service with the United
States, AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said Wednesday.
   Albania's hardline communist government began allowing calls
from Albania to go through on March 24, Linnen said. He said
operator-assisted calls from the United States to Albania will be
put through starting sometime in May, depending on Federal
Communications Commission approval, and direct-dial service will
begin in the fall.
   Linnen said AT&amp;T also has a petition before the Treasury
Department to allow formal negotiations with Vietnam for the first
phone service with that country since the end of the Vietnam war.
   He said Vietnam, which has no diplomatic relations with the
United States, has shown a willingness to resume phone service in
preliminary talks with AT&amp;T representatives. AT&amp;T needs a license
for the formal negotiations because of the U.S. trade embargo
against Hanoi.
   ``When we see countries that cannot be reached from the United
States, our objective is to start up service, regardless of
whatever political situations that exist,'' he said.
   ``We have nothing going on right now with Cambodia and North
Korea, but clearly our objective is that since they are not served,
we want to be able to do that in time,'' said Linnen.
   Albania, on the coast of the Adriatic Sea north of Greece, has
not gone through the governmental reforms seen in other Eastern
European communist nations, although there have been growing
demonstrations for change.

<HEAD>Money Can Grow on Trees, Small Woodlot Owners Advised</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says small-scale
farmers who have woodlots on their property sometimes don't realize
that money does grow on trees.
   And if you want to start from scratch and wait 15 to 50 years,
depending on the region, newly planted trees eventually can return
a profit.
   Experts say at least 6 million people own woodlots averaging 40
to 50 acres. They make up about one-third of the nation's 348
million acres of private timberland.
   The woodlot possibilities are described in a fact sheet by the
Office for Small-Scale Agriculture, which is operated by USDA's
Cooperative State Research Service.
   Previous topics have included sheep, goats, mushrooms, foliage
plants, herbs, wildflowers, herbs specialty vegetables and
``exotic'' livestock such as ostriches, llamas, alpacas, water
buffalo and European fallow deer.
   ``Many can improve their land management,'' the report said.
``This fact sheet is intended mainly for them rather than for
others who may want to try to get into the business.''
   But there are newcomers to woodlot management, including many
farmers who are planting trees on more than 2 million acres under
the government's Conservation Reserve Program.
   The program offers initial planting assistance and annual rental
payments to farmers who agree to take highly erodible cropland from
production for 10 years and protect it with grass and trees.
   A number of other federal and state programs, along with private
efforts, are directed at woodlot improvements.
   Most woodlot farmers ``don't fully manage their operations'' and
timber growth generally reaches only 50 percent to 60 percent of
potential, the report said. Good management means getting each acre
to produce the maximum annual growth possible, and to replace
harvested trees.
   ``Owners with already established woodlots often have immediate
income potential,'' the report said. ``Sometimes, however, the
return covers decades.''
   One example cited by the USDA agency was reported in the
American Tree Farmer, official publication of The American Tree
Farm System, which has certified 65,000 tree farmers on 91 million
acres.
   Nels Hanson, president of the Washington Farm Forestry
Association, told about a couple, Lula and Vern Johnson, who bought
their 40-acre Washington farm for $102 an acre, including a
six-acre patch of 40-year-old Douglas fir trees.
   Between 1949 and 1987, as money was needed to clear and plant
understocked areas, they logged and thinned the stand. When the
stand of Douglas fir was sold to the Weyerhaeuser Co. in 1988, it
had 660,000 board-feet of lumber and brought nearly $382 per
thousand, or $252,000.
   ``Not everyone can find a timber investment to match that,'' the
report said.
   For those wanting to start a long-term timber program, unused
areas along streams or creeks often good sites. The exact species
of trees would depend on local growing conditions and advice from
foresters.
   ``The South produces salable lumber products in 15 to 25
years,'' the report said. ``In the North and West, it usually takes
30 to 50 years. In the South, final harvests usually take place in
30 to 40 years and in the North and West about 60 to 80 years.''
   The report added, ``Fairly intensive management is required to
produce sawlogs in those time frames.''

   Government weather watchers say much of the
drought across the Great Plains has been eased since the first of
the year.
   A weekly weather and crop report Wednesday by the Commerce and
Agriculture departments said last month was ``mild and wet across
much of the United States.'' Historically, it was the 10th warmest
and 35th wettest March on record.
   However, the report said ``unusually dry conditions'' prevailed
over the Northeast, Northwest and West last month.
   ``Rainfall during the past three months has erased the moisture
deficit accumulated in late 1989 across most of the primary hard
red winter wheat region'' extending from southern and western
Nebraska to the Texas panhandle, the report said.
   Statewide precipitation figures for January, February and March
showed wet conditions extended through Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa,
Kansas, Louisian, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. For
Alabama, Louisiana and Oklahoma, it was the wettest first quarter
on record.
   But in contrast to the wetness of southern and central states,
the report said the West had ``unusually dry rainy season'' and
that October through March ranks as the third driest such period on
record.
   ``There were 130 tornadoes across the continuous United States
in March 1990,'' the report said. ``This is the second highest
figure for March since 1953.''

   Private exporters have told the Agriculture
Department the Soviet Union has bought an additional 175,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for delivery through
mid-May under a long-term grain supply agreement.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Wednesday the wheat was sold by
three private companies, which will receive subsidies under the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $34.13 per
ton, or about 93 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest wheat was sold by J. Aron &amp; Co.,
100,000 tons; Union Equity Cooperative Exchange, 50,000; and
Mitsubishi International, 25,000.

<TEXT>
   Maneuvering his fenderless Volkswagen through
Lima's dusty streets, taxi driver Segundo Flores Gutierrez
explained why he has become an ardent supporter of presidenital
candidate Alberto Fujimori.
   ``He'll bring us Japanese money, technology, ethics. We'll be
totally Orientalized.''
   But others believe Fujimori, 51, is just another Peruvian with
little to back up his claims that he can capitalize on his Japanese
heritage to rebuild the nation's faltering economy.
   The son of Japanese immigrants was virtually unknown to
Peruvians a month ago. Now he's favored to become the next
president after forcing front-runner and celebrated novelist Mario
Vargas Llosa into a runoff.
   Vargas Llosa was hoping for a majority in Sunday's balloting but
received just 32 percent of the vote. Fujimori, with less than 6
percent voter support in the polls a month ago, soared to second in
a field of nine candidates and won nearly 30 percent of the vote.
   Now Vargas Llosa is considering bowing out and giving Fujimori
the presidency.
   Fujimori made a strong showing by raising the hopes in millions
of voters in this impoverished nation ravaged by a decade-old
insurgency by the Maoist-inspired Shining Path.
   Part of his appeal is that he has never held political office.
   ``Fujimori is new and independent. Our other politicians are all
used up, exhausted,'' said a candy vendor who supported Vargas
Llosa until three days before the election.
   Vargas Llosa is also new to politics, but was faulted by voters
for his affiliation with traditional right-wing parties. Analysts
say he also was too frank in detailing his plan for harsh austerity
measures.
   People who know Fujimori best say he is a natural politician.
   He speaks English, French and German as well as Spanish and
Japanese. He was No. 1 in his graduating class of agricultural
engineers in 1961. He did post-graduate work at the University of
Wisconsin and the University of Strasburg in France.
   But he attended high school in a working-class neighborhood, and
his immigrant father fed the family by working as a tailor and a
night watchman.
   That background gives him a common touch that he has used with
Peru's poor.
   ``He's a consummate politician, an absolute expert at
manipulating people'' says an administrator at the National
Agricultural University, where Fujimori was as rector from 1984
until last year. The administrator asked not to be identified by
name.
   Fujimori has said that as a Japanese-Peruvian, he would be
better able to attract Japanese aid to Peru. That claim has
irritated Japan's ambassador to Peru, according to diplomatic
sources.
   Many professors at the National Agricultural University say that
as rector, Fujimori relied solely on Peru's bankrupt government
instead of seeking foreign aid for the school.
   ``He never made any contacts with international groups that
support agricultural research,'' one professor said.
   A member of the administration, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said: ``How can he claim that he'll attract Japanese
money to Peru? There's not a single yen in this whole university.''
   Lima's large Japanese community has been somewhat surprised by
Fujimori's campaign, which has played on the Peruvian stereotype of
Japanese as being honest and hard-working.
   ``His popularity is very surprising,'' said Juan Iida, publisher
of a Japanese-language newspaper in Lima. ``We didn't even know who
he was.''
   Many in the Japanese community says Fujimori's values are more
``Peruvian'' than Japanese and some who have worked with him
question his ability to resurrect Peru's shattered economy.
   Former colleagues at the university, for instance, criticize his
management of the school. At one point, they say, 200 of the
university's milk cows dried up for lack of food and water.
   Critics say Fujimori was ultimately responsible for ensuring
proper care for the cows. Supporters say the national government
was at fault because it withheld funds.
   The same accusations are made about four laboratory buildings
that stand half-finished in the middle of the university's campus.
   Fujimori himself appears to have no doubts about his chances of
being elected president and governing the nation of 22 million.
   Even while barely a blip on pollsters' charts, he confidently
predicted to anyone listening that he would win the election.
   Along with their four children, Fujimori and his wife, Susana
Higuchi, run their own three-acre farm, of which the candidate
proudly speaks when claiming he will revitalize Peruvian
agriculture.
   But even if Fujimori cannot increase the yield of Peru's farms _
now strangled by drought, rebel fighting and a poor economy _ or
attract Japanese help, some Peruvians still support him.
   ``The Japanese are the most patient people in the world,'' a
waiter in a Lima restaurant said. ``They know how to live on rice
and water, and before long that may be just what Peruvians will
need to learn.''

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration says a Soviet bid to
make a united Germany a member of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact is
an unacceptable formula for neutrality that could lead to future
instability in Europe.
   President Bush firmly believes that German membership in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization alone is ``the best guarantee
for long-term peace and continued stability,'' White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday.
   ``That Germany should be a member of NATO and the Warsaw Pact is
another formula for neutrality,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``It is a status that we believe, the Germans themselves and
their neighbors believe is undesirable,'' he said and added: ``We
strongly support full membership of a united Germany in NATO. We
are opposed to neutrality,''
   The negative White House reaction, which was echoed at the State
Department, followed a Soviet proposal for dual German membership
in both military alliances for a five-to-seven-year transition
period, culminating in the formation of a wholly new but yet
undefined European security system.
   During his visit to Washington last week, Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze dropped the previous Soviet
insistence that a united Germany had to be entirely neutral.
   Asked if there was room for compromise in the U.S. position,
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said there was not.
   She also said she did not know whether the Soviet proposal
represents ``an opening shot, an opening (negotiating) position.''
   Ms. Tutwiler and Fitzwater declined to discuss a possible
transitional period in Germany's status, saying only that a unified
Germany must stay in NATO.
   Fitzwater raised the possibility of a NATO summit meeting later
this year to discuss Germany and the alliance's own changing role.
   ``President Bush and many of the Western leaders have spoken
about a larger political role for NATO and one that is more
involved in providing political, economic and social stability in
Europe in these times of change,'' the spokesman said.
   Concerning whether Soviet troops should be allowed to stay in
East Germany and whether NATO troops should be allowed in the East,
Fitzwater said, ``Those are all issues that will have to be worked
out with the alliance.''
   He said NATO will determine its troop deployment position, not
the World War II victors _ France, Britain, the Soviet Union and
United States _ that are working with East and West Germany on the
reunification plan.
   Shevardnadze first raised the possibility of German membership
in both pacts simultaneously at a news conference at the State
Department last Friday, saying it was an idea he had heard
mentioned.
   But he had already used the idea as the centerpiece of a
magazine article to be published next month.
   ``Many of our experts ... believe that the idea of `dual
membership' for Germany could provide a pragmatic way out of the
difficulties emerging now,'' Shevardnadze wrote in his article for
the May issue of ``NATO's Sixteen Nations,'' an independent
publication focusing on international security issues.
   ``I would favor a serious and thorough analysis of this
option,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush's Broccoli Ban Well Known to Public, Survey Finds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's distaste for broccoli is
getting nearly six times as much public attention as Earth Day,
according to a survey of people's attentiveness to the news.
   The Times Mirror Center for The People and The Press said
Wednesday that its interviewers asked 1,212 people age 18 and older
what vegetable it is that Bush recently said he wouldn't eat.
   Seventy-six percent said broccoli, the right answer. Four
percent named some other vegetable. The rest refused to answer or
said they didn't know.
   By contrast, 13 percent knew that April 22 is being observed as
Earth Day to honor the environment. Fifteen percent gave a wrong
answer and 72 percent said they didn't know when asked what was
special about the date.
   On another question, the center reported that 74 percent of
those responding said they approved of Bush's overall performance.
Sixteen percent disapproved.
   Sixty-four percent said they were optimistic that the president
would make progress in solving the country's long-term problems.
   In response to more specific questions, 39 percent said Bush was
doing a good or excellent job in dealing with long-term economic
problems. The corresponding percentage was 20 percent on health
care problems and 32 percent on education and the environment. On
all issues, the largest group, from 39 percent to 46 percent, said
he was doing only fair.
   The survey also found, for the fifth month in a row, that
Americans paid more attention to foreign news than domestic news.
   The organization listed 18 news stories and asked people which
was the most important.
   Forty percent cited an international story, with 21 percent
naming Lithuanian independence. Also mentioned were other political
developments in the Soviet Union, Germany and elsewhere in Eastern
and Central Europe. Two percent named the release of black leader
Nelson Mandela from a South African prison.
   Four percent mentioned domestic stories, including oil spills,
the NCAA basketball playoffs, the death of 87 people in a fire at a
social club in New York and the attempt in Idaho to pass a bill
that would severely restrict abortions.
   Ten percent named stories not on the list, 43 percent said they
didn't know and 2 percent refused to answer. This adds up to only
99 percent because the percentages were rounded to the nearest full
number.
   The survey results are based on telephone interviews conducted
under the direction of Princeton Survey Research Associates from
April 5-8, with the 1,212 respondents interviewed by The Gallup
Organization. The results are subject to a sampling error of plus
or minus three percentage points.

<HEAD>Officials Sending Out Details on Spinal Cord Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials, criticized for
slowness, say they hope to soon begin sending 19,000 physicians and
hospitals detailed information about a new treatment for patients
with spinal cord injuries.
   Officials announced March 30 that a study had found the steroid
therapy effective, but a consumer health group complained that
nearly two weeks later many emergency-room and trauma-care
physicians still did not know enough about the treatment to use it.
   After receiving a letter from the Public Citizen Health Research
Group and requests from physicians, public health officials decided
Wednesday to send a three- to four-page summary of the study
findings to physicians and hospitals.
   ``We'll get it out as quickly as possible,'' said Jim Brown, a
spokesman for the Public Health Service, which includes the
National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and
Stroke in Bethesda, Md.
   The study, sponsored by the institute, found that high doses of
the steroid methylprednisolone given within eight hours of a spinal
injury significantly reduces paralysis.
   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the health group, welcomed the
institute's action, but said: ``It's tragic that it's taken so long.
   ``Several weeks have gone by since (the research was accepted
for publication in a medical journal) when they arguably could have
notified hospital emergency rooms,'' he said. ``It's too late for
these people.''
   About 10,000 Americans suffer spinal cord injuries each year,
and medical experts say 95 percent of those patients could benefit
from the treatment because they are admitted to hospitals within
eight hours.
   Wolfe noted that each day of delay means that 20 or 30 victims
of spinal cord injuries might not receive this breakthrough
treatment, which he said could mean the difference for some between
using crutches and a wheelchair.
   Wolfe said he had found that many physicians weren't using the
treatment because they hadn't yet seen data documenting its
effectiveness.
   Michael B. Bracken, a professor at the Yale University School of
Medicine who directed the study, was preparing a summary of the
research findings that will be mailed to 6,000 hospitals and 13,000
physicians, said Brown of the Public Health Service.
   Institute officials had said they made the unusual move of
announcing the research findings before their publication next
month in the New England Journal of Medicine so that physicians
could start using the treatment earlier.
   News stories about the treatment included telephone numbers for
physicians to call for more information. However, a toll-free
number with a recorded message was available only the weekend after
the announcement, and another number at the institute was answered
only during daytime working hours.
   Physicians who want more information before they receive the
mailing may call the institute during daytime working hours at
(301) 496-5751. Brown said officials were working on making a
recorded message available on that number for night and weekend
calls.

<HEAD>Army to Abandon Shooting Some Goats for Medical Training</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army is abandoning a long-held practice of
shooting goats at a Texas base to train doctors in treating
military trauma, but a medical group that sought the moratorium
says the woundings are continuing at Fort Bragg, N.C.
   The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine said 800 to
1,000 goats a year were being shot in the legs at Fort Sam Houston
in San Antonio until the moratorium. The practice, however,
continues at Fort Bragg, and as many as 1,200 goats are involved,
the organization said.
   Dr. Neal D. Barnard, a psychiatrist and president of the
committee, said he believes the Army decided to use goats because
``no one would care about an animal with an unpopular face, not a
cute and cuddly face. However, the military was wrong.''
   Barnard said the physicians group sought in moratorium in part
after such Army specialists as radiologists and psychiatrists, who
normally don't treat trauma victims, were being told to participate
in the training at Fort Sam Houston.
   ``I was very angry, for a couple of reasons,'' Barnard said
Wednesday. ``The first is that it's not a very nice thing to be
shooting these animals. Secondly, it's not even very good training.
If you really want to be good at treating wounds, there's no
substitute for going into a clinical setting, an emergency room or
an operating room, and that's the way all competent trauma
physicians are trained.''
   Barnard said the wound of a goat is far different that a human's
wound, and that shooting a goat in the leg ``has no relation to an
abdominal wound or a chest wound or a head wound. ... The tissue
feels different in the goat _ it's got thick, hairy skin.''
   Barnard said the Army had been shooting goats to train doctors
since 1958, and that he learned of the ban late last week.
   Pat Davis, chief of public affairs for the Army's Academy of
Health Sciences at Fort Sam Houston, said she could not confirm how
long the woundings had been taking place. The ban took effect about
90 days ago.
   Ms. Davis said the Army did not use firearms to inflict the
wounds. Instead, she said, it used ``a firing mechanism'' to fire a
``projectile,'' or metal pellet, into a goat's leg.
   The military had been using the pellets to simulate the
``shocking impact'' of firing at a human from a military weapon,
the spokeswoman said. Military weapons fire projectiles at a far
higher speed than a civilian handgun, she said, and the tissue
damage is far worse.
   The military's weapons cause ``a great deal of destruction to
the tissue,'' she said, and if military physicians do not clean the
wound correctly, ``the guy will lose his limb and probably his
life.''
   But Barnard said there has never been a single study showing
that using goats for this type of training was effective.
   ``They (the military) never bothered to look, just spent money
year after year shooting these goats,'' he said.
   Barnard also said the Army's decision was only temporary and
that his organization would push for a permanent ban, along with a
ban at Fort Bragg.
   ``They're calling it temporary. We are saying enough is enough.
Civilian physicians don't train this way.''

<HEAD>Barry Moves to Dismiss Cocaine Possession, Perjury Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry is seeking dismissal of
drug and perjury charges against him, while some Barry advisers are
portraying him as having been reluctant to use drugs on the night
of his arrest.
   The government ``manufactured the crime'' that produced Barry's
arrest in January, the mayor's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, said in
court papers seeking dismissal of a cocaine possession and perjury
indictment.
   Top city officials on Wednesday distributed a version of events
that allegedly preceded Barry's arrest in an FBI sting operation.
Their chronology of events depicted Barry as reluctant to use drugs
and ignorant of how to smoke a crack cocaine pipe.
   Those assertions contrast with an account of the case provided
by law enforcement sources, who have said Barry used hand signals _
rubbing his fingers together under his nose _ to indicate that he
wanted to use cocaine.
   The chronology was prepared in a draft of the court papers but
was omitted from the document filed in court.
   Court papers filed by Mundy on Tuesday said a videotape that
allegedly shows Barry smoking crack cocaine should not be used in
the mayor's trial.
   Mundy also asked U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to
throw out grand jury testimony in which Barry allegedly lied about
his drug use. Mundy argued that Barry had been assured he was not
the target of a drug probe.
   Barry faces an eight-count cocaine possession and perjury
indictment that was returned several weeks after his Jan. 18
arrest. The mayor was arrested after allegedly being videotaped
smoking ``crack'' cocaine in the downtown Washington hotel room of
a female companion, Hazel ``Rasheeda'' Moore.
   ``We will respond to all defense motions in court,'' U.S.
Attorney Jay B. Stephens said in a statement. He did not elaborate.
   The chronology, according to a Barry aide who spoke on condition
of anonymity, was prepared by three people who have seen the FBI
videotape, including Mundy.
   According to the chronology, Moore received money from Barry,
but the mayor ``gave no indication that any drugs were to be
purchased for him or that he wanted to use any drugs.''
   When asked moments later by Moore if he wanted to smoke crack
cocaine, Barry ``clearly and unequivocally said no,'' it said.
   But when Moore mentioned to Barry that they could obtain some
``powder'' cocaine from a woman undercover agent who was posing as
a friend of Moore's, Barry asked Moore to summon the woman back to
the room.
   The draft said that after the agent left, Moore produced crack
cocaine and handed the pipe to Barry, ``who asked words to the
effect of `how does the pipe work''' and handed it back to Moore.
   After further refusals, Barry lit the pipe, inhaled twice, put
on his suit jacket and was arrested as he tried to leave, the draft
said.
   In the court papers filed Tuesday, Mundy argued that Barry never
intended to meet Moore that evening, and agreed to go to her room
only after she declined to meet him in the hotel lobby or bar.
   Mundy also argued that Barry expressed no desire to use drugs,
and agreed to do so only after Moore produced them.
   If convicted of a felony, Barry would be barred from office and
prohibited from running for re-election.

<HEAD>13 Percent of Americans Have No Health Insurance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Census Bureau projection that 13 percent of
Americans are not covered by health insurance is in line with
numerous other estimates cited by proponents of government-mandated
universal health coverage.
   The Census Bureau said Wednesday that 26.5 percent of Hispanic
Americans were not covered in 1988 by either public or private
insurance compared to 20.2 percent for blacks and 11.7 percent for
whites.
   The age group least likely to have insurance protection was 16
to 24, with 21.9 percent lacking coverage. About 16.2 percent of
those 25 to 34 were uninsured and 15.3 percent of people under 16
lacked coverage.
   In the 35 to 44 bracket, 11.2 percent of people don't have
insurance, while the rates are 10.5 percent for those 45 to 54 and
9.3 percent in the 55 to 64 group.
   All but 0.3 percent of people over 65 are covered by Medicare,
which is automatically available, but does require participants to
sign up for the government program.
   In addition to calculating the number of people with insurance
in 1988, the bureau asked about coverage over time. It found that
during a 28-month period from 1985 to 1988, 72 percent of people
had continuous coverage and 28 percent lacked protection for at
least one month during that time.
   The study found that 63.1 percent of Americans had insurance
coverage through their jobs, 14.4 percent were protected by other
private coverage and 9.5 percent had government insurance _
Medicare or Medicaid, the federal-state health program for the poor.
   The new Census figures are based on a surveys of three groups of
households that were interviewed periodically in the bureau's
Survey of Income and Program Participation.
   The three groups included from 11,500, to 13,400 households with
as many as 36,500 people interviewed in the various groups. The
margin of error for a sample that size would be 1 percentage point
or less.

<HEAD>Flags Of Convenience Issue Reviewed After Ferry Disaster</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of ships sail under flags of
countries they never visit. Shipowners say that allows them to
bring down costs but unions say the real bottom line is unsafe
ships and poorly trained crews.
   Last weekend's fire on the Bahamas-registered Scandinavian Star,
which trapped hundreds of passengers on an allegedly unsafe ship,
has prompted a review in Scandinavia of so-called
flag-of-convenience vessels.
   The Swedish Seamen's Union says they are dangerous and is trying
to get them banned from Swedish ports. Shipowners say the bunting
on the stern has nothing to do with the ship's safety.
   Responding to the deadly fire, a maritime commission from
Norway, Sweden and Denmark decided to tighten inspection procedures
for foreign-flagged ships in Scandinavian waters.
   About 170 people were killed on the 20-year-old ferry during the
overnight trip from Norway to Denmark. It was one of the worst
passenger ship disasters on record.
   Passengers charged that the Filipino and Portuguese crewmen on
the Scandinavian Star were poorly-trained to deal with the
emergency and could not overcome their language barrier.
   The ship's Norwegian captain, Hugo Larsen, stated at a maritime
inquiry in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Wednesday that the ship was safe
and the crew adequate.
   But the seamen's union said that because the ship was registered
in the Bahamas, it was not required to undergo the strict
inspection procedures required for Scandinavian vessels.
   They said that shipowners often register their vessels in
Panama, Liberia and other countries to circumvent the stringent
safety rules of their own countries and to take advantage of cheap
labor.
   Filipino seamen work for as little as $1.50 an hour on Nordic
lines, compared with about $10 an hour for a Scandinavian.
   ``It's a bit like 19th-century slave vessels,'' said Lennart
Johnson, an official at the Swedish Seamen's Union. The result is
``low-cost crews with poor education and low safety.''
   The Swedish Seamen's Union has a reputation for militancy and is
lobbying with legislators to toughen Swedish laws against vessels
flying flags of convenience. Johnson said about 2,000 merchant
ships flying flags of convenience dock every year in Swedish
harbors.
   Others disagree with Johnson's allegations.
   ``Some of the best operated ships in the world _ and some of the
worst operated _ fly flags of convenience,'' said David Larner of
Lloyds of London, the insurance company.
   ``Underwriters look first and foremost at the operators. If he's
good, with a good track record, then his premiums will reflect
that,'' Larner said in a telephone interview.
   But he also said that new operators with convenience
registrations ``make us look more carefully'' before issuing
policies.
   Tom Bringsvaerd, managing director of Fred Olsen Line, a
Norwegian ferry and cruise company, dismissed claims that service
or safety is affected by the hiring foreign seamen.
   ``They get the same training and same qualifications as
Scandinavians,'' said Bringsvaerd.
   He said Norwegian shipowners were adopting flags of convenience
to cut costs and remain competitive.
   Johnson dismissed the claim that local ferry companies were not
competitive as ``nonsense.''
   He said that Swedish ferry companies were immensely profitable.
   Bringsvaerd accused the Swedish union of exploiting the
Scandinavian Star disaster to push for tighter regulations that
will benefit its own members.
   ``They are misleading the public and using this tragic accident
to promote their own subjective interests,'' he said.
   The Portuguese trade unions representing crewmen on the
Scandinavian Star also rejected the criticism. ``We understand that
the Nordic unions are struggling to end foreign working aboard the
ships, but we don't understand that they could be so selfish to
take advantage of a disaster,'' the Portugese union said in a
statement issued in Lisbon.
   About 10,000 vessels worldwide fly flags of convenience, Johnson
said. Other experts said the figure varies, but all agree that the
practice is common.

<HEAD>Controversy Among Christians and Jews Over Passion Plays</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of Americans seeking a
profound religious experience will flock this year to elaborately
mounted passion plays, an art form that has been a source of
centuries of suffering for Jews.
   The plays in places such as Eureka Springs, Ark., and Spearfish,
S.D., evoke controversy among Christians and Jews about whether
they promote one of history's cruelest anti-Semitic stereotypes:
that Jews bear a collective guilt for all time for Jesus' death.
   The passion play, portraying Christ's death and resurrection,
dates to the 13th century. The famous passion play in the Bavarian
village of Oberammergau began in the 17th century as collective
devotion for surviving the bubonic plague.
   In the post-Holocaust era, many Jewish and Christian leaders are
questioning the effect of passion plays that retain some of their
medieval origins by portraying Jewish antagonists of Jesus as
``degenerate, loathsome, almost subhuman creatures,'' according to
an American Jewish Committee study.
   ``I think we are in a transition period in terms of
understanding the impact of the Christian Gospel on Jews and
Judaism,'' said the Rev. Vincent A. Heier of St. Louis, a Roman
Catholic priest who is vice president of the National Association
of Diocesan Ecumenical Officers.
   ``One of the problematic areas is passion plays.''
   Passion plays range from lavish professional productions to
small church-organized affairs at carnivals. The Institute for
Outdoor Drama at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
lists nine major U.S. passion plays.
   More than 200,000 Americans are expected to flock to the 1990
Oberammergau Passion Play, which is held every ten years in the
West German town. Officials at the Great Passion Play in Eureka
Springs expect 300,000 people to see their annual production in its
23rd season.
   Play organizers in Oberammergau, partly in response to concerns
raised by American Jewish leaders and some Catholic scholars,
decided to make changes in this year's production such as dropping
the horns from Jewish high priests and protraying Judas as a
confused rather than a coldly mercenary figure.
   But those who have raised similar concerns report mixed success.
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued a
``really terrific'' set of guidelines for local parishes to be
responsive to issues of anti-Semitism in passion plays, according
to Rabbi A. James Rudin, national interreligious affairs director
of the American Jewish Committee.
   One play that the committee said has shown vast improvement is
the Holy Family Passion Play in Union City, N.J.
   Others, such as the non-denominational productions in Arkansas
and South Dakota, have been resistant to change, according to some
observers.
   ``Part of it is we are really out of touch, both Christians and
Jews ... with the sensitivities of the other,'' said the Rev. John
Kelley, who took part in discussions on the Oberammergau production
for the National Secretariat of Jewish-Catholic Relations of the
U.S. Catholic Conference.
   He said a fairly common reaction among Jews is that all passion
plays should be banned, while the first reaction of many Christians
is highly defensive, saying there is nothing in the Scripture that
could be offensive to anyone.
   The Great Passion Play in Eureka Springs, which runs April 27 to
Oct. 27 this year, is the largest, and some say most problematic,
of the U.S. productions.
   Marvin Peterson, executive vice president of the Elna M. Smith
Foundation, which manages the production, said anti-Semitism was
not at issue because the production sticks as close as possible to
biblical accounts.
   Others say the production is historically inaccurate and jarring
in what a 1984 American Jewish Committee study called its
``malevolence'' toward Jews.
   Roslyn Borg, area director of the St. Louis chapter of the
American Jewish Committee, said the production isolates Jesus and
his followers from Judaism, costumes Jesus in white and his Jewish
antagonists in black and portrays Pontius Pilate as a somewhat
compassionate ruler who was easily influenced by the Jews.
   Critics contend other popular passion plays, such as the Black
Hills Passion Play presented in South Dakota and in Lake Wales,
Fla., are filled with distortions.
   Despite such concerns, a resurgence in religious interest in the
nation has increased the popularity of passion plays, Kelley said.
   ``If anything, the number of them seems to be growing,'' he
said. ``As people have a sense of need of religious experience, we
are going to be using this art form more, rather than less.''

<HEAD>Maker Reiterates Call for Owners to Modify Play Sets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hedstrom Inc., is renewing its call for
customers to modify several models of the backyard gym sets to
guard against potential injuries.
   The Pennsylvania-based company says it wants to hear from about
256,000 owners of its backyard gym sets equipped with ``glide
rides.''
   Hedstrom said it would provide free guards for the gliders,
which are suspended from the top bar of the gym sets.
   Children standing on the slide or crossbar of the gliders and
reaching up to propel or stop the ride and have ``entrapped or
pinched a finger in the bracket mechanism,'' causing severed
fingertips and severe cuts, the company said.
   The company is concerned because there has been such low
consumer response to a November 1988 repair program, the Consumer
Product Safety Commission said in an announcement reinstituting the
original offer.
   The repair program involves Hedstrom and Sears models of the
gyms sold nationwide from 1982 to July 1, 1988. Approximately
370,000 sets were sold but only about 14,000 consumers have
requested the free glide guards, said the CPSC.
   Affected models can be identified by reading the model label
found on the top bar. They include: Hedstrom models numbered 4-277,
4-377, 4-677, 4-778, 4-877 and Sears brand models 72226, 72066,
72026.
   Customers may contact Hedstrom at 1-800-233-3271 outside
Pennsylvania, or 1-800-242-9034 in the state. Buyers of the gym
sets may also write the company at Department 100, P.O. Box 432,
Bedford, Pa. 15522-0432.

<HEAD>Poindexter Gets Extra Week To File Appeal</HEAD>

   Former national security adviser John
Poindexter is getting an extra week to file motions asking a judge
to set aside his five felony convictions in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene on Wednesday granted the
extension, to April 24, that was sought by Poindexter's lawyers.
   The prosecution did oppose the extension.
   Poindexter's motion requested the extra time to file motions for
a directed verdict of acquittal and for a new trial, both of which
would require the judge to set aside last Saturday's jury verdict.
   The 53-year-old former admiral was convicted of conspiracy,
obstruction and lying to Congress in the Iran-Contra scandal, all
five counts against him. He could face up to 25 years in prison and
$1.25 million in fines when he is sentenced June 11.

   The Census Bureau is uncertain whether 70
percent of Americans will return their census forms as it had hoped.
   ``Fifty-five percent is today's figure (for forms returned) and
we're still hoping people will get them in,'' said the spokesman,
John Scholzen.
   As for the 70 percent target, ``Whether we'll make it or not I

   On April 26, the bureau will send enumerators to interview

   The bureau estimates it will have to spend $10 million for each

   The race between Republican oilman-rancher
Clayton Williams and tough-talking Democrat Ann Richards could
prove a crucial gauge of the strength of both parties in the 1990s,
state leaders say.
   With the down-and-dirty Democratic primary runoff over, both
nominees for governor pledged to stick to an issue-oriented debate.
   Republicans already were casting the race as a struggle between
conservatives and liberals. Democrats expect Ms. Richards, an
outspoken abortion rights advocate, to draw intense support from
women.
   Williams, 58, the oilman-rancher nicknamed ``Claytie,'' won the
Republican primary without a runoff last month in an $8 million
campaign. He says he'll bring to government the same management
style that made him a multimillionaire in business.
   Ms. Richards, 56, who became an overnight celebrity after her
no-holds-barred oratory at the 1988 Democratic National Convention,
had a bruising runoff Tuesday against state Attorney General Jim
Mattox but retains her ``star'' status and brings voters an
eight-year record of managing the state treasury.
   There was little discussion of the issues before the runoff, in
which Mattox alleged that Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic,
used illegal drugs, including cocaine, 10 years ago when she was a
Travis County commissioner.
   ``She's somebody who can make state government work,'' said Ed
Martin, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. ``She's
not the guy who has an $8 million mask and wants to take us back to
the thrilling days of yesteryear.''
   But Texas GOP Chairman Fred Meyer characterized the
gubernatorial race as ``a clear choice between a national liberal
Democrat and a moderate-to-conservative Republican, Claytie
Williams ... that's exactly the kind of matchup we like in Texas.''
   Ms. Richards strongly supports abortion rights; Williams has
said he opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or danger
to a mother's life.
   The abortion issue also could figure prominently in the U.S.
Senate race in which Democratic nominee Hugh Parmer already is
airing television commercials attacking incumbent Republican Sen.
Phil Gramm.
   Abortion-rights advocate Parmer has been sharply critical of
legislation Gramm introduced in Congress to restrict abortions. A
former Fort Worth mayor and current state senator, Parmer won the
nomination last month, as did Gramm.
   Gramm, who overpowered Democrat Lloyd Doggett in 1984, has said
he is prepared to spend up to $20 million to hold onto his seat.
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown said his party will pull
together to hold power in the nation's third-largest state.
   ``Ann Richards is ready to lead modern Texas into a new decade
and a new century. The Texas of tomorrow can ill-afford the
prehistoric notions of Clayton Williams,'' Brown said. ``Together,
we can make 1990 the stepping stone to a Democratic White House in
1992.''
   Incumbent Republican Gov. Bill Clements, 72, is not seeking
re-election.

   Veteran rabbit raiser Roy Rogers, who
was hopping mad after his rabbitry was raided by thieves, is back
in the bunnies.
   ``Friends are calling and bringing bunnies every day,'' said the
71-year-old Rogers. ``One brought in 19.''
   Dozens of would-be Easter bunnies were stolen early Sunday
morning from Roy's Rabbitry in southeastern Mississippi.
   The loss suffered by the 71-year-old Rogers attracted national
attention and scores of calls offering help.
   ``I've gotten so many calls,'' Rogers said Wednesday. ``People
call and offer me rabbits saying, `You taught me how to raise them,

   The town of Stanley cannot make heads or
tails of who won its mayoral election.
   But instead of flipping a coin to decide it _ as officials
earlier considered _ the city council voted Tuesday night to hold a
new election.
   In last week's election, the race ended in a tie between two
write-in candidates, incumbent David Sandberg and challenger Fred
Beehler. Each had 182 votes.
   Lavern Honrud came in third with 103 votes.
   Beehler said a coin toss wouldn't be fair to those who voted for
Honrud. Sandberg agreed, so the council set the new election for
June 12.
   Stanley, in northwestern North Dakota, has a population of about
1,000.

<HEAD>Inmate with AIDS Convicted of Attempted Murder in Biting Guard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE BURNEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury convicted an inmate infected with
AIDS of attempted murder for biting a sheriff's officer and
yelling, ``Now die, you pig.''
   The jury Wednesday also convicted Gregory D. Smith of four
counts of aggravated assault and one count of making terroristic
threats against the officer, Albert Waddington.
   Smith's case is one of about 10 in the country in which a person
with AIDS has been accused of attempting to spread the virus
through biting or spitting. Smith's attorney said an appeal would
rely on medical experts who say these are improbable methods of
spreading the disease.
   ``I believe the jury was impressed by the whole AIDS scenario,
hysteria,'' defense attorney Ralph Kramer said.
   The jury acquitted Smith on one count each of aggravated assault
and making terroristic threats in separate incidents involving two
other officers.
   Sentencing is scheduled May 18. Smith, who's serving a five-year
sentence for a robbery conviction, faces a maximum sentence of 30
years imprisonment. He contracted AIDS in 1985.
   Waddington clapped his hands after the verdict was announced and
left the courtroom without commenting.
   Smith shouted: ``On your way home, Waddington, stop in church
and ask God to forgive you for that lie.''
   Waddington said during the trial that Smith bit him on the hand
three times, spat on him and said ``Now die, you pig. Die from what
I have.'' Waddington, 26, has not tested positive for the virus.
   Smith, 26, has denied biting the guard. His attorney said the
scratches on the officer's hands were caused by the jagged edges of
Smith's handcuffs.
   The case is being closely watched by medical and legal experts
who fear it will fuel misconceptions about how the disease is
transmitted.
   ``I'm highly critical of attempted murder charges in biting
kinds of cases,'' said Larry Gostin, executive director of the
American Society of Law and Medicine and an associate professor at
Harvard's School of Public Health. ``What the criminal justice
system is doing here is posing a very serious crime for a highly
improbable result.''
   Kramer said he would appeal the verdict on the contention that
the judge improperly allowed testimony from the prosecution's
medical expert who said there was a slight possibility AIDS could
be transmitted through a bite.
   ``I expect New Jersey to take a stand on this issue and say `no
you can't charge a person with AIDS who bites with attempted
murder,'' Kramer said.
   An inmate was convicted in 1987 of assault with a deadly weapon
_ his mouth and teeth _ for biting two prison guards in Rochester,
Minn. The conviction was upheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in St. Louis.
   Harold Kasselman, the assistant Camden County prosecutor who
handled the case, said Smith was charged because he believed he
could spread the disease by biting.
   The fatal disease is generally transmitted through intravenous
drug use, blood transfusions and sexual contact.
   Authorities said the incident occurred June 11 as Waddington and
another guard, John Snow, attempted to put Smith into a patrol car
to take him to the county jail after he was treated for a back
injury at Cooper Medical Center in Camden.

   An AIDS-stricken man was prohibited from
having sex in prison as part of his sentence for participating in a
sex ring that preyed on boys.
   Joel Dunaway was one of two men convicted of second-degree
sodomy Wednesday. They were the last of a group of six men
convicted of hustling boys in the Mobile area over a 10-year period
and taking them on trips where the boys had sex with them in
exchange for drugs and liquor.
   Judge Douglas Johnstone sentenced Dunaway, 37, to one year in
prison and ordered him to abstain from sexual intercourse.
   If he has sex behind bars, it would violate his probation and he
could serve four additional years, said Assistant District Attorney
Jo Beth Murphree. She conceded, however, that the no-sex sanction
could be difficult to enforce.
   Johnstone also sentenced Giles Owen Hamm Jr., 30, to two years
in prison and five years probation. Four other men were convicted
earlier of participation in the boy-sex ring.
   Dunaway, arrested last April for having sex with a 13-year-old
boy, reportedly contracted the AIDS virus in 1988.
   Attorneys familiar with the case said the boy and others said to
have had sex with Dunaway received AIDS tests in 1988. The results
of those tests were sealed under Alabama's juvenile laws.
   FBI agent Leslie Berens said the victims, ages 12 to 17, were
picked up by the men and taken on trips. The FBI became involved
because some of the boys were taken across state lines to Tennessee
and New Orleans.
   ``They would drive around neighborhoods and look for kids on the
street and often these were bored kids sometimes from troubled
homes,'' Ms. Berens said.

   Pervasive fraud played a major role in the
collapse of many savings and loans, FBI Director William Sessions
said, but running down the illegal deals is a time-consuming and
complex process.
   ``Experience demonstrates that insider abuse is a major factor
in almost all of our investigations involving failed financial
institutions,'' Sessions testified Wednesday at a House Banking
Committee hearing on savings and loan fraud.
   A shortage of resources and the complexity of the fraud has
hampered the agency's work, he said.
   ``It is often difficult to distinguish failures that involve
fraud from failures resulting from poor management and poor
business decisions,'' Sessions said.
   Last week, the General Accounting Office estimated a $325
billion to $500 billion federal bailout would be necessary over the
next 30 years for failed savings and loans nationwide. Taxpayers
would foot most of the bill.
   In Texas, site of about a third of the cases the FBI is
investigating, frauds ``frequently involve the looting of
institutions for the direct financial benefit of officers,
directors or major stockholders,'' Sessions said.
   The banking committee, chaired by Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, is
holding two days of hearings in Dallas to examine investigations of
fraud in the industry.
   The committee has asked key figures at some of the most
notorious failed thrifts to testify, but only one, Thomas Gaubert,
has indicated he will appear.
   Gaubert, who has been acquitted once on fraud charges, was
chairman of Independent American Savings Association. The three
others asked to testify were Edwin T. McBirney, former chairman at
Sunbelt Savings Association of Texas; Don R. Dixon, former owner of
Vernon Savings and Loan Association; and Jarrett Woods, of Western
Savings Association.
   All four institutions were recipients of multimillion-dollar
bailouts.
   ``This is not a problem that is limited to Texas, or even to the
Southwest,'' Sessions said. ``More incidents of insider abuse have
been identified in Texas, however, because the Texas institutions
are coming under closer scrutiny as they are being declared
insolvent.''
   In North Texas alone, Sessions said regulators have ``38
separate savings and loans institutions identified wherein major
conspiratorial fraud is alleged. Over 500 subjects have been
identified for investigation and possible prosecution.''
   Gonzalez criticized the Bush administration for being slow to
implement regulations and safeguards adopted last year in bailout
legislation.
   ``We gave the regulatory and the law enforcement agencies
unprecedented power to deal with the crisis and the cleanup,''
Gonzalez said, but the administration left key jobs unfilled and
failed to develop a ``sense of urgency.''
   ``The American people _ judging from my mail and my telephone
calls _ are angry about what they see as `business as usual'
approach to a disaster that is costing them dearly,'' Gonzalez said.

<TEXT>
   Bette Davis fans packed an auction of the late
star's possessions, but many left empty-handed as pre-sale
estimates were eclipsed by bids in the hundreds and even thousands
of dollars.
   A box lot of eyeglasses and false eyelashes that graced those
famous Bette Davis eyes was valued at $25 to $50, but sold
Wednesday for $550.
   A 16-by-20-inch crayon drawing by costume designer Edith Head of
a black-gowned Miss Davis in the movie ``All About Eve,'' was
valued before sale at $1,200 to $1,800. It fetched $23,100.
   A leather script cover bearing the initials ``BD,'' along with
two scripts and a notepad, brought $4,400. The pre-sale estimate
was $50 to $100.
   ``I thought I could get some of the small memorabilia, but it
started too high,'' said Honey Schiller, one of 1,000 people who
got into the auction at the William Doyle Galleries. ``I love Bette
Davis. I think she was the best. She was beautiful. I could watch
`All About Eve' all night.''
   The entire sale of 261 lots had been expected to bring $60,000
to $103,000, but the final tally was $221,336.50, according to
Lewis Webre, spokesman for the gallery.
   Webre attributed the high sale prices to good publicity, a
capacity crowd and an abiding interest in a star who ``embodies
everything that embodied Hollywood in the old days. She is
everyone's kind of bitchy alter-ego.''
   Potential bidders _ many attracted by some lots with an
estimated worth of under $100 _ snaked 1{ blocks out of the
building before auction time.
   ``It looked more like a Hollywood premiere than an auction,''
Webre said.
   Miss Davis, who died in October at age 81, kept the furniture,
paintings, photographs, designer gowns, glassware, jewelry, books
and memorabilia in a six-room townhouse in West Hollywood.
   A director's chair from ``Family Reunion,'' embossed with Miss
Davis' name and the slogan, ``She Did It the Hard Way,'' went for
$1,320.
   Among those vying for the movie legend's goods were other
celebrities, including actress Cicely Tyson, who wore a babushka
and sunglasses and was wedged in with the standees. She remained
incognito as she waved her paddle to cinch several purchases.
   Miss Tyson paid $880 for a group of framed wall hangings, one
inscribed ``Beauty is as Beauty Does,'' and another, ``No Guts No
Glory.'' She also bought a photograph of Miss Davis, posed at the
St. James Club on Sunset Boulevard, for $3,300.
   Miss Tyson had no comment. But her fellow auction-goers weren't
shy.
   ``My mother used the same diaper service as Bette Davis did,''
boasted Shelle Ackerman, a singer and actress, who arrived 1{ hours
early for a front-row seat.
   ``It's kind of scary to know she actually touched and lived with
all of this,'' said Charles Pierce of North Hollywood, Calif., an
actor who has impersonated Miss Davis since 1954.

   The chief index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
outdistanced earlier losses to close higher Thursday in volatile
trading, and the dollar weakened against the yen.
   The dollar closed at 158.00 yen, down 0.50 yen from Wednesday's
close of 158.50 yen. The currency opened at 158.17 yen and traded
between 158.00 yen and 158.53 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gained 182.92 points, or 0.62
percent, to close at 29,623.20. The index, which shed 184.40 points
Wednesday, gained over 230 points in the morning and then lost
197.73 points in late morning before rebounding in the afternoon.
   Traders attributed the Nikkei's afternoon rebound to
index-linked arbitrage buying.
   Nomura Securities analyst Yoshiro Inoue said speculative
sellings would decrease before Easter holidays, which start Friday
in many European nations.
   While this week's earlier losses contributed to a sharp decline
in the morning, the yen's stability against the dollar reassured
market players, prompting buying in the afternoon, he said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar was lower in the afternoon as
investors bought yen against the West German mark, dealers said.
   ``Market players are having difficulties figuring out the
direction of dollar-yen trading, so their interest has shifted from
the dollar to the mark,'' said Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with
Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   Other dealers said market participants were shying away from
major moves ahead of the Easter holiday.

   They're lean, green and seemingly ubiquitous:
They're even coming to the cable-TV screen.
   Showtime Networks Inc. has acquired the exclusive broadcast
rights to the movie ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' in a
seven-film deal with New Line Cinema.
   The pay cable network on Tuesday refused to say how much it paid
for the film package led by the country's most popular movie, which
has grossed $51 million in its first 10 days of release.
   The pizza-eating mutants' film debut is fast approaching the
record for nation's the highest-grossing independently released
film. ``Dirty Dancing,'' which grossed $54 million, holds that
record.
   Other New Line films included in the Showtime package include
the recently released ``House Party,'' a story of black teen-age
turmoil told through rap music and hip-hop culture; Freddy Krueger
running amuck again in ``A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream
Child;'' ``Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3'' and ``Heart Condition.''
   Two other films will be released in theaters later this year,
then move to the combined 10 million subscibers of Showtime and The
Movie Channel.
   ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' will make its cable premiere in
the spring of 1991, Showtime officals said.

   The Contras' top military commander
says he does not believe Nicaragua's new government will be able to
control the Sandinista army and his troops will not lay down their
weapons.
   Wednesday's statement was the most adamant by Contra leader
Israel Galeano since his subordinates signed an agreement with
aides of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro to disarm by
her inauguration April 25.
   U.N. peacekeeping forces began arriving in Honduras on Monday to
oversee the demobilization of the 12,000 Nicaraguan rebels, most of
whom were in border camps in this nation until recently.
   But Galeano said his troops will not hand over their guns to the
peacekeepers.
   ``Mrs. Chamorro defeated the Sandinistas in elections, but I
believe she will not be able to impose her authority on the
Sandinistas once she takes office,'' Galeano said.
   He said his ``rebel army will honor its commitments and will
abandon its camps in Honduras on April 18. But the army of
resistance will continue fighting in the mountains inside Nicaragua
until their is true democracy in our nation.''
   Mrs. Chamorro's conservative United National Opposition (UNO)
defeated the 9-year-old leftist Sandinista government by a
landslide in Feb. 25 elections.
   There was no immediate comment by the Sandinistas on Galeano's
statements, but the Nicaraguan government has said the refusal of
the Contras to disband could threaten the transition.
   They say the Contras must demobilize immediately and that the
Sandinista People's Army _ except for its top ranks _ should remain
intact.
   The Sandinistas and UNO have signed a transition protocol that
would allow the Sandinistas to retain control of the army while
giving it at least a semblance of political neutrality.
   Under the accord, Mrs. Chamorro promises to respect ``the
integrity and professionalism'' of the armed forces, and all senior
officers are barred from holding positions of leadership in
political parties.
   About 9,000 armed Contras have infiltrated back into Nicaragua,
leaving behind 1,000 wounded rebels and stragglers at their base
camps at the Honduran border town of Yamales.
   The Contras and Mrs. Chamorro's representatives agreed Monday to
start dismantling the camps next Wednesday, under the supervision
of U.N. peacekeepers.
   The Contras in Nicaragua were supposed to rally in ``safety
zones'' to surrender their weapons and disband under a cease-fire.
   But Galeano said only the rebels who remain in Honduras will
surrender their weapons.
   He criticized the peacekeepers for not finding funds to resettle
Contras and their relatives who were in Honduran camps.
   ``They have taken no action to provide humanitarian aid for our
wounded and our relatives,'' Galeano said. ``We will need about
$1.5 million monthly for that.''
   He said the United States, which supported the Contras in their
nine-year war against the Sandinistas, should pay for resettling
those who lay down their arms.
   Contra spokesman Alejandro Acevedo said he and six other members
of a special rebel commission, including three civilians, would go
to Managua on Monday to try to negotiate a truce.
   Acevedo said the commission will meet with Roman Catholic
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and Chamorro representatives _ but
not with the Sandinistas.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Philly Police Taping Rizzo Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Mayor Frank Rizzo's radio talk show
has been taped regularly by the Philadelphia Police Department in
an effort to monitor complaints by officers, a newspaper reported
today.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer, citing unidentified police sources,
said the tapes of ``Frank Talk With Frank Rizzo'' on WCAU-AM were
sent to senior police supervisors whenever the daily show contained
comments critical of the city's Police Department or Mayor W.
Wilson Goode's administration.
   Rizzo, a former police chief, was mayor from 1972 to 1980. He
lost a close race to regain his City Hall post from Goode in 1987.
   The city's Democratic leaders have complained Rizzo, 69, uses
his three-hour show on the CBS owned-and-operated station to attack
Goode, urge voters to register Republican and launch a fifth bid
for mayor in 1991.
   The newspaper's sources said police supervisory officials were
told to keep track of critical comments so the department could
match them with voice prints of officers.
   The department keeps voice prints of uniformed officers to
identify those who might misuse police radios, police officials
said.
   Police Commissioner Willie L. Williams and city Managing
Director David H. Pingree acknowledged the tapes had been made, but
Williams said they were not being used to identify officers.
   Any officer found to have used the tapes to identify officers
calling the show would be ``appropriately disciplined,'' Williams
said. He said he routinely reviews videotapes of television news
broadcasts about the department but had never reviewed a tape of
Rizzo's show.
   The newspaper quoted two unidentified police officials who said
Williams' top commanders, also unidentified, routinely ask for
copies of the Rizzo tapes.
   Department officials said no officer had been reprimanded or
questioned about calling in to the show, the newspaper said.
   ``It just shows you where their priorities are,'' Richard B.
Costello, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5, told
the newspaper. ``Right now, your chances of getting shot in
Philadelphia are about as good as they are in Beirut, but the
department is using people to track down phone callers.''
   Rizzo said he knew his show had been taped.
   ``A guy from the mayor's office told me,'' Rizzo told the
newspaper. ``I get most of my leads right from the mayor's office.
It's an outrage. This is a reign of terror. An absolute reign of
terror.''

Orange and Los Angeles counties, authorities said.
   The high temperature for the nation Wednesday was 101 degrees in
California at Death Valley and Palm Springs.
   Snow forced cancellation of a Chicago baseball game between the
Cubs and the Philadelphia Phillies.
   Snow also fell Wednesday evening over northern Maine, northern
Vermont, northeast New York, central Indiana, southern Michigan and
northeast Wisconsin. Rain dampened parts of southeast Florida,
southern Maine, western Pennsylvania, Ohio, central Kentucky,
central Colorado, east-central Washington state and along the
northern Pacific Coast.
   Today's forecast called for showers throughout most of the
Northeast. Rain also was expected for the northern Rockies and from
central Texas to Nebraska.

   Seven Democratic U.S. senators met with President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Kremlin today.
   Gorbachev greeted the delegation, led by Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell of Maine, in a large office dominated by a Soviet
flag and photographs of Communist heroes Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx
and Friedrich Engels.
   It was not clear whether Gorbachev regularly uses the office,
labeled No. 1 and located on the third floor of the Presidium
building at the end of a corridor lined with cabinets full of gifts
from foreign governments.
   The senators were scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze later in the day. They met earlier with the Foreign
Affairs Committee of the Soviet parliament and in Leningrad with
city officials and representatives of the independence-minded
Baltic republics.
   The delegation also included Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Bill

   The 85-year-old mayor survived a vote
to impeach him for racial slurs when two councilmen, his nephews,
voted in his favor.
   Mayort Ivey C. Berry couldn't remember a woman's name at a
Tuesday night council meeting and referred to her home as ``the
nigger's house,'' City Clerk Emily Daughtry said. He later used the
epithet again.
   The council chairman called for his resignation and held a
90-minute impeachment hearing. Berry has been mayor of the small
central Florida town for three months.
   Under the city charter, impeachment requires approval of four of
five council members. But Councilmen Doyle and Gordon Craig sided
with their uncle.
   Berry apologized, saying he had been told when he was raised
that's what blacks were called.
   ``There was no malice intended by Mr. Berry. He has a lot of
black friends in this community,'' Berry's attorney, C. John
Coniglio, said.
   T.H. Poole Sr. of the Florida branch of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People favored Berry's removal.
   ``Don't let him tell you this was a nickel-and-dime mistake,''
Poole said.

<TEXT>
   President Yang Shangkun will visit five Latin
American countries in mid-May, the latest in a series of trips by
Chinese leaders to court better relations with the Third World.
   The Foreign Ministry said today that the 82-year-old Yang will
make official visits to Mexico, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and
Chile.
   High-level official contacts with the West have virtually
stopped since China's military crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement last spring, and the Beijing government has sought to fill
the diplomatic gap by stressing its Third World ties.
   Yang visited Egypt and three other Middle East countries in
December and Premier Li Peng traveled to Nepal, Pakistan and
Bangladesh in November.
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen has traveled extensively through
Africa, the Middle East and India.
   The post of president is largely ceremonial, but Yang, a former
general in the People's Liberation Army, is one of China's most
powerful political figures because of his strong military links.
   Foreign China-watchers say Yang is a top candidate to succeed
85-year-old Deng Xiaoping as China's paramount leader.

<TEXT>
   At least one trader at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange wasn't enthusiastic about the mandatory ethics course that
professors at a downtown law school will teach the Merc's 2,500
members.
   ``To get some lawyers to try to tell us what's ethical and what
isn't ethical is kind of funny,'' said the livestock trader, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I don't think I'm going to come
out of there doing anything different than when I went in.''
   Members began signing up Wednesday for the mandatory two-hour
class, part of a reform effort implemented after FBI moles
infiltrated the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade in a probe of
suspected fraud. Forty-eight people, mostly traders, were indicted
last summer.
   ``We believe you will find the session both interesting and
stimulating, and trust you will leave the session with much to
think about,'' Merc officials said in a letter to members last week.
   The Board of Trade already has started a mandatory ethics
session for all new members, said spokesman Michael O'Connell.
   He said BOT officials also are working with the Center for
Ethics and Corporate Policy in Chicago to create an course that
could include other members as well.
   James Oliff, second vice president of the Merc's Board of
Governors, said anyone who trades at the Merc must take the new
course. He said they will first be given ``a definition of what
ethics is all about.''
   ``Basically, we want to impress upon our members that in
addition to looking at rules, that there are other actions that
should govern their conduct and that's ethical behavior,'' he said.
``They are guardians of the exchange as a financial institution as
well as guardians of themselves.''
   Merc members will be told the consequences of violating rules,
and will be shown hypothetical situations involving questionable
trading practices, Oliff said.
   The class is being offered free, after trading hours, and will
be taught by faculty at Chicago-Kent College of Law.

   A man charged in an illegal nightspot fire that
killed 87 people pleaded innocent today to 174 counts of murder and
other charges.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was guarded by four armed court officers as
he was arraigned before Judge Burton R. Roberts in trial-level
state Supreme Court.
   Gonzalez, who spoke to the court through a Spanish translator,
mumbled ``no culpable'' when asked how he pleaded on the charges.
   The judge told attorneys that under state law, Gonzalez could
serve only a single 25 years-to-life sentence even if convicted on
all charges. The law stipulates his sentences would have to run
concurrently, Roberts said.
   Gonzalez is accused of setting a fire that trapped revelers
inside the tiny Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx.
   Authorities charge that the Cuban immigrant, enraged by the
rejection of a former girlfriend who worked at the club, bought $1
worth of gasoline, spilled it in the illegal club's doorway and set
it aflame. Only five people escaped the cramped club following the
4 a.m. fire, including the girlfriend.
   Court-appointed defense attorney Richard W. Berne said today he
had not decided whether to use an insanity defense for his client,
although he had indicated earlier that was a possibility.
   Berne said he plans to ask for a dismissal of all charges
against Gonzalez because the lawyer was not given access to a
videotaped confession by his client when the case was submitted to
the grand jury.
   Gonzalez was indicted March 30 on 174 counts of murder, two
counts of arson and single counts of attempted murder and assault.
He was charged with two separate murder counts for each of the
victims killed in the social club blaze.
   The club lacked proper permits and did not have adequate exits
and sprinkling systems.

   Alma Sioux Scarberry, a reporter, writer,
entertainer and publicist whose career spanned more than seven
decades and included interviews with Charles Lindbergh, Babe Ruth
and Jack Dempsey, has died.
   She was 90.
   Ms. Scarberry, who moved to Austin in 1965, was ``a flamboyant
woman,'' said her longtime friend, Cactus Pryor. ``She had a lot of
color in her clothing and in her personality. She just had a lot of
verve.''
   Ms. Scarberry died Tuesday of a stroke at a San Antonio nursing
home.
   She got her start in reporting in 1919 at the Elmira (N.Y.)
Advertiser. She also worked for the New York Mirror, Pittsburgh
Sun-Telegraph, Washington Herald Times and King Features.
   Ms. Scarberry enjoyed telling tales from her days as a
journalist.
   ``She was accidentally knocked down by Jack Dempsey once,''
Pryor recalled. ``She and a bunch of other reporters were
interviewing him and he was demonstrating (a punch). I guess she
got in the way.''
   She wrote 21 novels, including ``Thou Shalt Not Love,'' ``The
Flat Tire'' and ``Dimpled Racketeer.''
   Ms. Scarberry also wrote songs for country singer Tex Ritter and
performed in Irving Berlin's Broadway show ``Music Box Revue'' in
1922 and 1923.
   ``She had a very full life and enjoyed good health through her
90th birthday,'' said her son, Theodore Klein Jr.
   In addition to Klein, survivors include four grandchildren. A
memorial service will be next week, Klein said.

<HEAD>Irish Leader Urges Economic Unity With British Province</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM BRODIE</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey brought a message of economic unity to Northern Ireland on
Wednesday, but Protestant demonstrators shouted support for the
island's political division.
   ``Haughey, Haughey, out, out, out!,'' demonstrators cried.
   Haughey, chairman of the European Community's Council of
Ministers, told a conference on cross-border trade that ``economic
forces will inevitably interlink the economies of both parts of
Ireland.''
   ``As the technical and fiscal borders disappear, and both
economies will converge, it will make simple common sense for us to
combine in facing the problems and opportunities that the situation
will present equally to us both,'' Haughey said. ``These are the
economic realities of the future.''
   The overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland has been
separated from Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland since 1922,
when Ireland gained independence from Britain. Ireland's
constitution lays claim to the whole island, and Northern Ireland
has been torn by conflict between advocates of Irish unity and
those loyal to Britain.
   Reg Empey, the lord mayor of Belfast and a Protestant, spoke to
the conference before Haughey and denounced Ireland's claim on the
province.
   About 300 Protestants gathered outside the Europa Hotel before
Haughey's speech. They were kept under control by a large security
operation mounted by the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern
Ireland's police force.
   ``Haughey is here to dance on the graves of the province's
bereaved,'' the Rev. Ian Paisley told reporters outside the hotel.
   Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, referred to
the slaying of four members of the Ulster Defense Regiment. They
were killed Monday by an Irish Republican Army bomb. Ireland's
foreign minister, Gerry Collins, earlier this year had called for
the heavily Protestant unit to be disbanded.
   Haughey repeatedly stressed the two parts of Ireland should
cooperate within the 12-nation European Community. Haughey
currently speaks on behalf of the bloc; its presidency rotates
every six months.
   ``Our economic and social characteristics, which are shared by
both parts of Ireland, would benefit if a combined approach could
be established,'' Haughey told the conference, which was organized
by the Institute of Directors.
   ``We have a clear mutual interest in strengthening community
policies for the less developed regions. It makes sense for both
parts of the island to cooperate and share the costs in developing
strategy.''
   Earlier, as he was ushered quickly past the demonstrators into
the hotel, Haughey was asked whether he worried about his personal
security while in Belfast.
   ``Not particularly,'' he said. ``I know the RUC (Royal Ulster
Constabulary) will make every effort to look after me.''
   A front-page cartoon in The Irish Times of Dublin on Wednesday
taunted Haughey for his past criticism of British rule in Northern
Ireland. The cartoon showed Haughey surrounded by RUC men with the
prime minister saying: ``Still a police state!! Thank goodness.''
   Irish leaders have rarely visited Northern Ireland since
sectarian and political fighting flared in 1969.
   Haughey's predecessor, Garret FitzGerald, was in the province in
November 1985 to sign the Anglo-Irish Agreement with Mrs. Thatcher.
The accord, deeply disliked by Protestants, gives Dublin a formal
consultative role in Northern Ireland's affairs and pledges the two
governments to cooperate against terrorism.

<TEXT>
   The pressure of college entrance exams has led to
more class hours and required courses in the nation's public high
schools, the Education Ministry said today.
   Of Japan's 3,893 public high schools, 12.4 percent require more
than 35 hours of classes per week, up from 7.9 percent in 1982,
when the ministry urged high schools to reduce classes to 32 hours
per week, according to a ministry survey.
   It said 63.1 percent of the schools required 34 hours of classes
per week _ six hours a day Monday through Friday and four hours on
Saturday _ during the academic year that ended March 31, 1989.
   The ministry also has urged schools to limit their school year
to 35 weeks. However, 65.7 percent of the high schools had more
than 35 weeks of classes, including 16.3 percent with more than 41
weeks, the ministry said.
   The number of courses required for graduation also has increased
at many schools, the ministry said.

<HEAD>Stocks Higher, Dollar Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended
higher after a day of up-and-down trading today, while the dollar
fell against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average closed at 29,623.20, up
182.92 points, or 0.62 percent. The index first quickly gained more
than 230 points, then sank 197.73 points at the morning session's
end before rebounding in the afternoon.
   Traders attributed the Nikkei's afternoon recovery to
index-linked arbitrage buying in options, which allow holders to
buy or sell a certain stock at a given price and time. Today was
the last day for using options in April.
   ``The index rose after mixed trading involving options,'' said
Nomura Securities analyst Yoshiro Inoue. He said speculative
trading was likely to decrease before the Easter holidays that
start Friday in many European nations.
   While this week's earlier losses contributed to the index's
morning decline, the yen's stability against the dollar reassured
market players, prompting buying in the afternoon, he said.
   ``The yen can support the stock market as long as it remains
stable. It does not have to continue to rise,'' Inoue said.
   Trading was thin with 430 million shares changing hands on the
first section, down from Wednesday's 500 million.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 158.00 yen,
down 0.50 yen from Wednesday's close of 158.50 yen. The currency
opened lower at 158.17 yen and ranged between 158.00 yen and 158.53
yen.
   The dollar began rising against the yen during the morning
session as market players sold the yen against the West German
mark, dealers said.
   The yen rose back against the dollar in the afternoon following
a reversal in the yen-mark trading, said a dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Dollar selling against the mark also supported the yen in the
afternoon,'' he said.
   ``Market players are having difficulty figuring out the
direction of dollar-yen trading, so their interest has shifted from
the dollar to the mark,'' Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical
Bank in Tokyo, said.
   Other dealers said market participants were shying away from
major moves ahead of the Easter holidays.
   In the bond market, the price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese
government bonds closed at 86.30 points, unchanged from Wednesday's
finish. Their yield also was unchanged at 7.295 percent.

<HEAD>Americans Lead Japanese in Leisure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan is leading the United States in
areas of productivity, education and trade but, not surprisingly,
it lags behind in one category: leisure time.
   American men spend on average 20.5 hours a week at leisure,
compared with 13.3 hours taken by Japanese men, according to a
University of Michigan study. The disparity is even greater between
American women, who take 21.8 hours of time out each week, and
Japanese women, who take just 10.6 hours.
   Economics professors Frank P. Stafford and F. Thomas Juster said
they studied time spent on ``active leisure,'' or sports and
hobbies, and ``social interaction'' in the United States, Japan and
six other countries.
   Using statistics from surveys of 1,000 or more adults conducted
between 1964 and 1987 in the United States, Japan, the Soviet
Union, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Denmark and Sweden, they found a
gradual decline in the number of hours men spend at work in all
eight countries.
   Among the other findings:
   _The workweek ranged from 54 hours in the Soviet Union to 33.4
hours in Denmark. Japanese men worked 52 hours a week, Hungarian
men 50.8 hours and American men 44 hours.
   _The amount of time that men spend on housework ranged from 18.1
hours a week in Sweden to 3.5 in Japan. American men spent 13.8
hours, Soviet men 11.9 hours and Norwegian men 16.8 hours a week on
housework.
   _Women in the Soviet Union spent more time working than women in
the other countries, averaging 39.3 hours a week on the job and 27
hours a week doing housework. American women averaged 23.9 hours a
week on the job and 30.5 hours a week working at home. Danish women
worked 20.8 hours a week on the job and 23.1 hours a week at home.
   The researchers said Hungarians and Soviets work so many hours
because they earn relatively low wages, not enough to buy added
leisure time.
   Neither Japan nor the United Sates approaches the 54.3 hours a
week spent on leisure activities by men in Denmark or the 53.7
hours spent by Danish women, according to Stafford's study.

<TEXT>
   Engineers will need a day or two before considering
the start-up of an oil-fired unit at the Turkey Point power plant
complex after a hydrogen gas explosion and fire shut the unit,
utility officials said.
   No one was injured and two nuclear plants and another oil-fired
plant at Turkey Point were not affected by Wednesday's gas leak,
spokesmen said.
   The fire was confined to an elevated enclosure housing an
exciter, a small auxiliary generator that provides the initial
source of electricity to power the generator.
   Plant operators took the unit off line when they detected a loss
of hydrogen pressure, and the fire was discovered in the exciter
about 15 minutes later, the Florida Power &amp; Light Co. said.
   ``The visible damage is very, very moderate,'' said spokesman
Dale Thomas. ``We can see a little bit of twisted metal around the
housing that contains the generating equipment, and there's a
little bit of black soot around the bearings.''
   The plant's fire brigade had to put out the fire twice because
the flammable hydrogen continued leaking and exploded a second
time, he said.
   The hydrogen leaked from the sealed room where the gas cools the
spinning turbine generator, passed through a turbine shaft and into
the exciter enclosure, a shed-sized building on a deck two stories
high, the utility said.
   Utility workers will have to remove the generator housing on
Unit 2 to assess damage and repair costs, which could take a day or
two, Thomas said.
   Engineers would have to make sure the turbine generator, which
spins at 3,600 revolutions per minute, remained in alignment and
its mounts and shafts were not damaged by the force of the
explosion, said Gary Mehalik, another utility spokesman.
   Unit 2 was the only one operating at Turkey Point at the time of
the fire, which left the 2,090-megawatt plant idle indefinitely.
   The loss of Turkey Point's generating capacity was not
considered crucial because Florida Power &amp; Light could boost the
power generated at other plants or turn on idle units elsewhere in
its system.
   The Miami-based utility is the state's largest, serving 3
million customers from Key West almost to Jacksonville.

whose powerful stories about landless peasants spurred farm reforms
60 years ago, died Wednesday of cancer at age 89.
   Lo-Johansson became a force among the ``proletarian writers,''
who based their stories on the lives of poor workers and peasants.
His writings in the 1930s helped end a system under which farm
workers were strongly dependent on land owners.
   He wrote 60 works from 1927 to 1986. In 1985, France named him

   Gen. Michel Aoun's gunners battled rival
forces under militia chieftain Samir Geagea with howitzers and
mortars today in the fight for control of the Christian enclave.
   Police said four people were killed and seven wounded in the
exchanges across east Beirut and Kesrouan province north of the
capital.
   The thuds of exploding shells echoed across the city as the two
sides hammered each other's residential districts with 130mm
howitzers.
   The escalation, which began about 3 a.m., kept civilians in
underground shelters and brought life to a standstill.
   By police count, the struggle for the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave has killed 873 and wounded 2,365 since it broke out Jan. 30.
   The showdown, the worst intra-Christian confrontation of the
nation's 15-year-old civil war, has caused material damage
estimated at $1 billion.
   According to police figures, 400,000 of the enclave's 1 million
people have fled to safer areas in Lebanon and neighboring
countries.
   Palls of smoke billowed from the mountain resort of Kleiat, a no
man's land separating Aoun's troops and Geagea's fighters in upper
Kesrouan. Phosphorous shells rained on its already wrecked
restaurants and villas, a police spokesman said.
   Poor villagers, who had remained in Kleiat despite the savage
shelling duels, deserted their town early this week to caves they
dug in nearby mountains, said the police spokesman, who cannot be
named in line with regulations.
   Interior Minister Elias Khazen visited Jounieh, provincial
capital of the Kesrouan province, on Wednesday and said the
government of Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi planned to spread
its authority to the Christian enclave.
   Khazen, who has been based in Moslem west Beirut since the
government was formed Nov. 24, said he will operate from Jounieh's
city hall for two days weekly to underscore Hrawi's determination
to govern the enclave.
   His visit to the province came after repeated calls by Geagea
for Hrawi's government to assume control over the army barracks and
government facilities in his areas of influence.
   Aoun has rejected the Arab League peace agreement under which
Hrawi was elected and does not recognize the president.
   Khazen sailed to Jounieh by boat from Beirut to avoid
checkpoints erected by Aoun's troops along part of the coastal
highway that connects the capital with the port, which is under
Geagea's control.
   He also visited Maronite Catholic patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir at
Bkirki, his mountain seat above Jounieh, and declared that
``Lebanon will be united again.''
   Khazen, his eyes brimming with tears, said: ``The extraordinary
conditions that had prevented us from living in the eastern areas
(Christian enclave) will be over soon. Now we are in Kesrouan.''
   Kesrouan province is Geagea's main power base and the reserve
for his militia, which fields 6,000 hard-core fighters and about
30,000 reservists. Aoun has 19,000 army troops.

   China's Foreign Ministry today refused to answer
questions about reported violent ethnic uprisings in extreme
western China and a ban on travel by foreign tourists and
journalists to the area.
   Unconfirmed reports say dozens of people have been killed.
   At a weekly briefing, spokeswoman Li Jinhua evaded repeated
questions on reported Moslem unrest in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, saying the Foreign Ministry was not responsible for
internal affairs and ``I am not clear about the situation.''
   Government officials in Xinjiang and Beijing have neither
confirmed nor denied reports that troops were sent in Friday to
quell rioting by Moslem ethnic groups in three cities near
Xinjiang's borders with the Soviet Union and Pakistan.
   Few details were known of the unrest, reported by Western and
Asian diplomats in Beijing. Foreign travelers in Xinjiang say the
disturbances occurred in the Taklimakan Desert cities of Kashgar,
Hotan and Kuqa.
   One Asian diplomat said the rioting in Kashgar was sparked by a
dispute over the construction of a mosque and involved Kirghiz
people, a Moslem group with ethnic ties in the Soviet Union.
   Kashgar is an ancient Silk Road oasis city of 100,000 people
about 150 miles from the Soviet border and 700 miles west of
Urumqi, the provincial capital of Xinjiang.
   Foreign travelers in Urumqi quoted residents as saying two
Chinese officials sent in to resolve the dispute over the mosque
were murdered. Troops then dispatched killed 50 people in putting
down the rioting, according to the unconfirmed reports.
   Foreign travelers have been prevented from traveling from Urumqi
to Kashgar since the weekend and the Urumqi Foreign Affairs Office
has told foreign journalists they may not come to Xinjiang.
   The Pakistan government was informed Monday that the Khunjerab
Pass, the 13,120-foot-high road linking Pakistan with Kashgar, will
not open as planned at the end of this month because of an
avalanche.
   The Urumqi office has referred journalists to the Foreign
Ministry in Beijing, but spokeswoman Li said she could not say why
travel to Urumqi and Kashgar, both open cities, had been halted.
   Asked about bans on travel by reporters to other areas with
heavy minority populations, such as Tibet, Inner Mongolia and the
southern border with Burma, Li said there were more than 600 open
cities in China and ``it will take you a long time to go to more
than 600 places.''
   Such a city supposedly is open to any foreign tourist, but
Beijing-based foreign journalists must obtain approval from local
authorities before traveling to any city outside the capital.
   The Chinese government has become increasingly sensitive about
minority unrest since the rise in ethnic nationalism in bordering
Soviet republics and a surge of challenges to Communist Party rule
in Mongolia.
   Xinjiang officials in recent months have repeatedly warned of a
threat of separatist activities backed by foreign forces. The local
government has called for increased surveillance of religious
activities being used for separatist causes.
   More than half the 14 million people of Xinjiang, an arid
province that comprises one-sixth of China's land, are Moslems of
the Uygur, Tartar, Kazakh, Kirghiz and other groups.

   Nearly 133 years after the SS Central
America sank in a hurricane, assorted predators are churning up a
storm over the shipwreck's $1 billion cargo of gold ingots, coins
and passengers' fortunes.
   A lawsuit to establish whether the treasure had ever been
abandoned originally pitted the Columbus-America Discovery Group, a
group of 100 investors who used Space Age technology to find the
wreck, and 45 insurance companies who claim rights to the treasure.
   But the intervention of Columbia University and two businessmen,
who contend their data were used to pinpoint the wreck, has turned
the trial into a multisided squabble over fine points of law.
   The sixth day of testimony ended Wednesday, and arguments in the
case are expected to end this week.
   The treasure hunters have invested $10 million and 13 years in
raising to the surface more than a ton of gold ingots and coins
buried 1{ miles under the sea 160 miles off the South Carolina
coast. They say 2 tons remain on the ocean floor.
   The ship ran into a hurricane and sank on Sept. 12, 1857, as it
sailed to New York from California. Between 362 and 423 of the 578
people on board are said to have perished.
   Among the cargo were 3 tons of gold bars and freshly minted
``double eagle'' gold coins from the San Francisco mint worth $1.6
million at the time and about $450 million at today's prices. Many
passengers were carrying fortunes, and Columbus-America officials
believe the total treasure could be worth up to $1 billion.
   The insurance companies argue that they never gave up their
claims, and are asking for the return of the insured gold.
   However, not all of the gold was insured, and business records
describing the insured cargo and proof that the claims were paid no
longer exist.
   Lawyers for Columbia said a sonar survey by Dr. William Ryan, an
oceanographer at Columbia, was done for two businessmen in search
of the wreck in 1984. Richardson said Harry John and Jack Grimm, a
Texas oilman, paid for Ryan's research.
   The lawyers said Ryan later exchanged the data with Thomas G.
Thompson, a president of Columbus-America, and that Thompson used
the data to locate the wreck site.
   The university claims Columbus-America then misled the public by
saying the wreck was discovered when it hadn't been.
   Attorneys for Columbus-America denied the information from Ryan
was of any use.
   The treasure hunt has been further complicated by revelations
about John, the heir to the Miller Brewing Co. fortune.
   John used DeRance Inc., a Catholic charity he had set up in
1946, to establish Santa Fe Communications, which he used to spend
millions looking for lost treasures. Santa Fe paid Columbia
University more than $300,000 for a sonar survey of a portion of
the ocean floor looking for the Central America.
   John testified that in 1984 the board of directors of DeRance
decided to stop all treasure hunts, and he signed over the rights
to the Columbia research to the Province of St. Joseph of the
Capuchin Order in Detroit. At the time, the Internal Revenue
Service was questioning Santa Fe's tax-exempt status.
   John testified that he bought back the rights from the order for
$10 two weeks before the trial.
   On Tuesday night, the order renegotiated the agreement, which
now will give it one-third of any proceeds John recovers through
the court.

   A fifth of vodka goes a long way. Adil Altom Hamza
drank most of one in Boston and woke up in a cargo plane on his way
to Ypsilanti, Mich.
   ``I'm drunk,'' he told Michigan State Police officers when he
walked off the four-engine Lockheed Electra at Willow Run Airport
in Ypsilanti at 3:30 a.m. Wednesday.
   The troopers were there because the pilot, startled in
mid-flight by the appearance of Hamza radioed that he had a
stowaway.
   Hamza, a 27-year-old student from Sudan, told The Boston Globe
he drank most of a bottle of vodka while wandering Boston streets
alone Tuesday night, took public transportation to Logan
International Airport and got on a plane.
   ``I had a few drinks too many. All I can remember is looking for
a place to sleep,'' he was quoted as saying.
   The place he found was the cargo hold of the Zantop Airlines
plane, and that's where he woke up, scared and surprised, he said.
   ``It was dark. There were boxes all around me. It was freezing.
There was nothing there, just the feeling of flying. I thought it
was a nightmare.''
   He went through a door leading into the plane's cabin and tapped
on the shoulder of the flight engineer, one of three crew members,
to ask where he was.
   ``They were scared. Really scared,'' Hamza said. ``They thought
I was going to hijack the plane. But I said, `It's OK, I'm drunk.'
When the pilot said, `You are halfway across the U.S.,' I said, `Oh
my God.'''
   A half-hour later, the plane landed in Ypsilanti. State troopers
questioned Hamza and then let him sleep it off in the state police
lockup. Later they got him a bed at the Shelter Association of Ann
Arbor, and he slept 12 more hours.
   The Massachusetts Port Authority, the Federal Aviation
Administration and the FBI are trying to find out how Hamza evaded
security and got on the plane.
   Hamza, of Brookline, Mass., came to Boston more than three years
ago to attend the University of Massachusetts. He took off a term
this year and hopes to transfer to Northeastern University in the
fall, he said.
   Meanwhile, he is trying to find a way back to Boston. ``They are
going to let me sleep here, and they are feeding me,'' he said.
``Everyone is nice. I'm just trying to find a way back home now.
I'll work or take donations.''

<HEAD>Highest Roller Coaster Lawsuit Settled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EASTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The saga of the dueling roller coasters _
with officials in Pennsylvania and Texas each claiming title to the
world's highest wooden roller coaster _ has coasted to a
not-so-thrilling conclusion.
   Representatives of Dorney Park and Six Flags Over Texas met for
2{ hours Wednesday to settle their argument, which wound up in
federal court after Dorney Park sued. The dispute arose because
there is no universally recognized way to measure a roller coaster.
   The agreement: Six Flags' Texas Giant has the highest lift and
Dorney's Hercules has the highest drop.
   Six Flags in Arlington has been saying its new Texas Giant is
143 feet high, compared with 95 feet for Hercules.
   Dorney maintained that although the Texas ride climbed higher,
Hercules plummeted farther because its tracks go over a cliff.
   ``Who goes on a roller coaster for the lift?'' said Harris
Weinstein, chairman of the board of Dorney Park and Wildwater
Kingdom outside Allentown.
   Under the agreement, both parks released a statement that said,
in part: ``Six Flags Over Texas recognizes that Hercules at Dorney
Park and Wildwater Kingdom has the highest drop of any wooden
roller coaster in the world at 157 feet.
   ``On the other hand, Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom recognize
that the Texas Giant at Six Flags Over Texas has the highest lift
of any wooden roller coaster in the world at 143 feet.''
   Michael Crowther, Dorney's director of marketing, said, ``The
general public is perfectly free to develop their own opinion on
which coaster is the tallest.''
   A message left for Six Flags' attorney was not returned
Wednesday night.
   The agreement was approved by U.S. District Judge Franklin S.
VanAntwerpen.

<HEAD>Police Fire Tear Gas in Protest over Jewish Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police fired tear gas today to disperse
Christian clerics, including the bishop of the Greek Orthodox
Church, who protested the settlement of about 150 Jews in the Arab
Christian Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City.
   Police moved in after one priest tore down a poster with an
Israeli Star of David that was put over a cross on the main door of
the building taken over by the Jews, witnesses said.
   The Jewish families, most of them headed by ultra-Orthodox
seminary students, moved into a four-building complex in the heart
of the Christian neighborhood Wednesday under police guard.
   The site, near the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, was viewed as
particularly provocative by Palestinian Christians, as was the
timing in the midst of Easter week observances. It was the largest
and most significant settlement of Jews outside the Jewish Quarter
in the old, walled city.
   Previously, two Jewish yeshiva seminaries were set up in the
Moslem Quarter and about 40 Jewish families took up residence in
the area, including former Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon.
   Jerusalem's Old City, divided into ethnic quarters, is home to
50,000 Moslems, more than 7,000 Christians and about 4,000 Jews. It
was controlled by Jordan from 1948 until 1967, when it was captured
by Israel in the Six-Day War and immediately annexed.
   Jews in the new settlement _ named Neot David, which is Hebrew
for Dwellings of David _ told reporters today that their 72-room
complex had been purchased legally from a Christian.
   They said they were trying to re-establish the Jewish community
that was driven from the area by Arab riots of 1936.
   But their move caused stone-throwing demonstrations by
Palestinian youths, angry statements from city and religious
leaders and a demonstration by Christian clerics.
   More than 200 clerics demonstrated outside the Greek Orthodox
Church headquarters around the corner from the Jewish settlement
and charged that the building had been illegally sold by a tenant.
   ``This is the property of the church. ... The Jews took over
this building. They made a contract in Geneva and bought it. I
denounce this act,'' said Greek Orthodox Patriarch Diodorus I.
   Police said an investigation proved the purchase was legal.
   Diodorus spoke after being overcome by tear gas and falling to
the ground. He showed reporters the chain on one of the gold
crosses he wears around his neck which was broken in the melee.
   Christian merchants closed their shops in protest, and scattered
bands of Arab youths were dispersed by tear gas when they threw
stones at the Jewish complex and at police, witnesses said.
   Police said three Palestinians were arrested.
   The move to set up the Jewish settlement drew strong criticism
from Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, who said he was upset that
the Jewish group had made the move during the Easter holiday.
   ``You can do this in another two days, when the holiday is
finished,'' Kollek said on Israel radio. ``To expect now that there
will be good relations, this won't happen.''

   Steve Gobie, the former paid lover of Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass., has been arrested on charges of marijuana
possession and destruction of property, police said today.
   Gobie was to be arraigned later today on charges of property
destruction and marijuana possession, police spokesman Ed Wilson
said.
   Police said the charges stemmed from an incident Wednesday in
which Gobie confronted Karen Zibrat, 27, an off-duty female police
officer, who was driving her personal car.
   Zibrat said a car being driven erratically nearly struck her car
and another vehicle Wednesday afternoon, Wilson said. ``When Gobie
stopped at a traffic light in northwest Washington, Zibrat
attempted to find out why he was driving erratically,'' Wilson said.
   Gobie then got out of his car, he said. When Zibrat attempted to
back up, Gobie jumped on the roof of her car and broke through the
sunroof, falling inside the vehicle, where a struggle ensued,
police said.
   Witnesses summoned police and arrested Gobie, who was held on a
$5,000 bond pending his arraignment.
   Gobie gained notoriety last year with his story of being Frank's
lover and operating a prostitution service out of Frank's home.
   Frank admitted that he paid Gobie for sexual favors, but has
denied any knowledge of the prostitution service.

<HEAD>Nine Killed in New South African Unrest; Mandela Slams

<TEXT>
   At least nine people were
killed in clashes between rival black factions, including five
people who were shot to death when assailants riddled a bus with
bullets, police said today.
   The new violence came as African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela criticized the pro-apartheid Conservative Party, claiming
the white opposition group was stirring racist fears to try to
wreck peace talks.
   The unidentified gunmen attacked the bus near Pietermaritzburg
in Natal Province late Wednesday, killing five of the occupants and
seriously wounding three, police said. The attack appeared to be
part of black factional fighting in the region that has claimed
hundreds of lives.
   In another part of Natal, a mob killed a woman by placing a
blazing tire around her neck in a ritual ``necklace'' killing near
Port Shepstone, police said. Few details were provided on the other
killings.
   Police also reported dispersing black protesters in several
areas who set fire to houses, stoned vehicles and clashed with
police patrols.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, who heads the police, told
Parliament in Cape Town today that he was confident the police
could maintain control of the country despite a rising tide of
violence.
   Vlok said the police could handle the challenges facing South
Africa during the coming decade as the country goes through major
changes.
   Mandela lashed out Wednesday night at the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party, charging it was racist and incapable of
accepting progress.
   Mandela, in an unusually harsh attack, said the party was
attempting to break up efforts by the government and the ANC to
negotiate an end to white-minority rule. He said the Conservative
Party was waging a campaign to discredit the ANC by stirring up
white fears.
   Party leader Andries Treurnicht ``is shaken by events he cannot
control and he is therefore seeking to sabotage a settlement
between the ANC and NP (the ruling National Party) and is trying to
corrode all potential support,'' Mandela told journalists after
returning from Zambia.
   Mandela charged that ``racist slurs'' being spread by the
Conservative Party were a threat to hopes of negotiating a peaceful
settlement in South Africa. The party contends that whites and
blacks cannot live together and is calling for a white homeland.
   Mandela and other ANC leaders are to meet May 2 with President
F.W. de Klerk to try to clear the way for full-scale negotiations
on ending white minority rule and sharing political power with
blacks.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC and other black opposition groups and
released Mandela in February to clear the way for power-sharing
talks.

   U.S. officials put a popular

   It was the first time in recent years that U.S. military
officials have placed an entire South Korean district off limits to
American soldiers and civilians. Officials said it was being done
to protect ``the health and welfare'' of U.S. personnel.
   ``When lives are at stake, no measure is too extreme,'' said an
unidentified official quoted in the statement.
   Itaewon is a shopping and entertainment area several city blocks
long near the 8th Army headquarters. Foreign tourists, shoppers and
U.S. military personnel shop there by day, and at night its
neon-lit bars and discos draw hundreds of young Koreans as well.
   The announcement was an apparent move to avoid clashes between
South Korean civilians and American soldiers who frequent
late-night bars and entertainment establishments.
   On Sunday, a crowd of Koreans chased two U.S. military policeman
and threw bottles, bricks and sticks. Two vehicles, including a
U.S. military patrol car, were demolished, the windows of a police
station were shattered and at least half a dozen people were
injured.
   U.S. authorities said the melee began when several Koreans
attacked a car being driven by a civilian Defense Department
employee. The Koreans say the man had struck several pedestrians in
the street with his car.
   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was
a feeling the ``rash of incidents must be stopped.''
   U.S. authorities have expressed concern over the use of group
violence to solve disputes between American soldiers and South
Koreans who frequently cannot communicate in a common language.
This week the U.S. military asked the South Korean military to
consider assigning uniformed national police to patrol the area.
   Anti-American feeling is strong in South Korea, especially among
radicals and dissidents who have demanded the withdrawal of U.S.
troops, claiming their presence hinders unification of South Korea
with Communist North Korea.
   Meanwhile, a group of American soldiers on a routine training
mission accidentally fired artillery rounds near a bridge leading
to the heavily fortified Korean border and five U.S. and Korean
soldiers were wounded.
   A guardpost at one end of the Freedom Bridge, frequently used by
tourist buses, was destroyed by the explosion, witnesses said. The
bridge itself was undamaged in the incident Wednesday. The site is
35 miles north of Seoul.
   In an unrelated incident, an American soldier was electrocuted
today at Camp Stanley north of Seoul when the communications wire
he was working on touched a high power line, U.S. military
officials said.
   The soldier's name was not released, pending notification of
relatives. He was assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division.

   Retail sales fell 0.6 percent in March
following a drop in February, the first back-to-back declines in
more than three years, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said sales decreased $907 million to a
seasonally adjusted $148.6 billion. That followed a revised drop of
0.3 percent in February, which had originally been reported as a
sharper 0.9 percent decline.
   March sales, which showed the steepest drop in five months,
softened in all sectors except food stores. Auto dealers reported
the fifth decline in six months. Sales at department and clothing
stores suffered from a later-than-average start to the Easter
buying season.
   ``March was weak but to me it was a deceptive weakness because
the previous month was revised up sharply,'' said economist Robert
G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. ``It's another one of those
more-of-the-same reports. ... The consumer is sort of doing what
the economy is doing. He's plodding ahead, but not in a straight
line.''
   Retail sales, which account for about a third of all economic
activity, are closely watched as a barometer of economic health.
Consumer demand has been weakened by the Federal Reserve Board's
high interest rate policy aimed at dampening the economy and easing
inflationary pressures.
   Auto sales totaled $30.7 billion in March, down 1.4 percent
following a 6.5 percent decline in February.
   Excluding the volatile auto sector, sales fell 0.4 percent in
March after a strong 1.5 percent gain a month earlier.
   Durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last three or
more years, have been particularly hard hit by interest rates
because buyers usually borrow to purchase them.
   Durable goods fell 0.8 percent in March following a 2.7 percent
drop a month earlier. Non-durable goods dropped 0.5 percent after
rising 1.1 percent in February.
   The department offered these other details of retail sales last
month:
   _Department and other general merchandise stores, down 1.0
percent following a 2.4 percent gain a month earlier.
   _Building materials, hardware and garden supplies, down 0.8
percent after a 2.5 percent gain.
   _Furniture, down 0.1 percent after a 2.2 percent rise.
   _Food stores, up 0.2 percent after a 0.9 percent advance.
   _Gasoline stations, down 1.7 percent after a drop of 0.8 percent.
   _Clothing stores, down 0.5 percent following a 1.7 percent gain.
   _Restaurants and bars, down 1.5 percent after a 3.6 percent rise.
   _Drug stores, down 0.9 percent following a 2.2 percent drop.

   A jury must decide whether John E. List
carefully weighed his decision or was compelled by twisted
religious beliefs to kill his wife, three children and mother 18{
years ago.
   The jury resumed deliberations this morning after meeting for
six hours following final arguments Wednesday, the eighth day of
the trial of the former Sunday school teacher.
   Defense attorney Elijah L. Miller Jr. has conceded that List,
64, committed the killings, but is seeking a verdict of
second-degree murder, which carries a 30-year maximum sentence and
possible parole after a third of the term.
   The prosecution, which argued that List acted with
premeditation, is seeking a verdict of first-degree murder, which
carries a life term with no parole until after 15 years.
   Miller argued that List, a pious and strictly raised Lutheran,
was watching his ``whole world falling to pieces'' when an
``obsessive-compulsive'' personality disorder, combined with
corrupted religious notions, turned him into a killer.
   List was beset by pressures, couldn't provide for his family
after a series of job failures, and saw his family slipping from
the church, Miller said.
   Union County Assistant Prosecutor Eleanor J. Clark urged jurors
not to delay justice any longer.
   ``Because this defendant was so successful in maintaining his
fugitive status, don't deny the state of New Jersey or Alma, Helen,
Patricia, John or Frederick justice,'' she said.
   Authorities found the bodies of his wife Helen, 45; mother Alma,
84; daughter Patricia, 16; and sons John, 15 and Frederick, 13, in
their 18-room Westfield mansion on Dec. 7, 1971.
   List, she said, ``acted as a hideous angel of death, weighing
the options right up until the night before, killing his family.''
   After slaying his family, List assumed another identity,
remarried and settled down in the Richmond, Va., area. He was
arrested in June after the killings were dramatized on a television
crime show and a viewer tipped authorities.

<TEXT>
   Exiled King Michael of Romania was
forced today to cancel his first visit to his native country in 43
years after the Bucharest government canceled his visa.
   The official Romanian news agency Rompres said officials
rescinded the visa today after the ex-monarch rejected the
government's appeal that he postpone his trip until after elections
set for May 20.
   While there was no official explanation for the visa
cancellation, the provisional government said the visit could cause
violence in Romania, which is still recovering from the overthrow
of hard-line Communists in December.
   The governing National Unity Front led by interim President Ion
Iliescu also was reportedly concerned that the former king's visit
might give a boost to rival parties in the election campaign.
   A spokesman for the Bucharest government, reading a statement,
said: ``The government has nothing against a private visit of the
ex-king in Romania. It cannot agree, however, to a visit with a
very political character.''
   ``It was to be a strictly private visit,'' former King Michael,
68, told a news conference at the Zurich airport, where he was
barred from boarding a Swissair flight to the Romanian capital of
Bucharest.
   ``I don't understand the decision to rescind the visas. I don't
know what concerns there could have been,'' he said.
   Rompres said authorities had conveyed a message to the former
king asking him to postpone the trip and had also issued
instructions to border guards to prevent him from entering the
country.
   The news agency said the Romanian Embassy in Berne, Switzerland,
also told Swissair officials the airline would be ``breaking
international regulations'' if it allowed a passenger without a
visa to board the flight to Bucharest.
   Despite the Romanian government's action, the former king flew
from Geneva to Zurich, where he had planned to catch a scheduled
direct Swissair flight at noon to Bucharest. But the airline's
management decided after a hastily called meeting that the
ex-monarch would not be allowed to board the plane.
   At his news conference, the ex-monarch held up his British
passport to show that it had been stamped with a Romanian visa.
   Despite the Bucharest government's decision, Michael said he was
still planning a visit ``as soon as possible.''
   The airport news conference marked the first time that former
King Michael himself has commented on the visit. Normally all
contacts with the press are handled by his daughter, Princess
Margarita, or by a Swiss spokeswoman.
   He was to have been accompanied on the visit by his wife, Queen
Anne, and his daughters, Margarita and Anne, who also all had their
visas canceled. They learned of the Romanian decision only after
leaving their home in Versoix near Geneva, Switzerland, to catch
the flight to Zurich.
   Another daughter, Helen, 39, arrived in Bucharest on Tuesday
with a convoy from Britain containing 120 tons of relief supplies.
The princess said she was ``struck by the dilapidation and
poverty'' she had seen in several cities.
   The former king has not set foot on Romanian soil since he was
forced to abdicate and leave the country by the Communists on Dec.
30, 1947.
   Michael said he had intended to stay no longer than 10 days in
Romania. Princess Margarita said in Geneva that the deposed monarch
viewed his trip as a spiritual pilgrimage and was not concerned
with possible violence.
   On Wednesday, the Bucharest provisional government, which came
to power in December after Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was
ousted in a bloody revolution, issued a statement warning of the
possibility of ``some violent manifestations'' if the ex-monarch's
visit took place as scheduled.
   The visit ``and the publicity surrounding it are interpreted as
a political gesture of a nature to bring about unwelcome elements
in the electoral campaign and stir new passions,'' the government
statement said.
   It said Michael's visit before the elections ``would be of a
nature exacerbating existing conflicts, while also endangering his
personal security.''

<HEAD>College Art Group Rules Out Cincinnati Because of Photo
Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A college art group has ruled out holding its
1995 conference in Cincinnati because of the controversy over a
photography exhibit that led to obscenity charges against a museum.
   Ruth Weisberg, president of the College Art Association, told
offficials in a letter that indictments charging the Contemporary
Arts Center and its director with pandering obscenity make
Cincinnati ``incompatible with the College Art Association's goals
of academic freedom.''
   A Hamilton County grand jury issued the indictments Saturday,
citing seven photographs of homosexual acts or nude children in the
175-photo exhibit of works by the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
   ``We were seriously considering Cincinnati,'' Ms. Weisberg, an
art professor at the University of Southern California, said
Wednesday.
   The Mapplethorpe exhibit opened in Cincinnati on Saturday and
more than 14,000 people visited the museum during the first five
days.
   Last year, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.,
canceled the exhibit, but it has been shown in several other
cities. The Washington exhibit prompted Congress to limit funds for
the arts after Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., declared the photographs
obscene.
   The 11,000-member association was founded in Cincinnati in 1912
and is based in New York.
   The National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts was
holding its national conference in Cincinnati in March when the
Mapplethorpe controversy erupted. It ended its conference by
resolving never to return to Cincinnati.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Criticized for Questioning Hispanic Parents'
Values</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos' claim that
Hispanic parents deserve much of the blame for their children's
high dropout rate is drawing fire from the nation's largest
Hispanic organization.
   Cavazos, himself Hispanic, said in a news conference Tuesday
night that problems Hispanics have in school cannot be attributed
completely to economic difficulties or language barriers because
other ethnic groups have overcome such barriers.
   ``We really have not cared that youngsters have dropped out of
school. We don't care, either teachers, parents, business
community, elected officials. We must have a commitment from
Hispanics, from Hispanic parents especially, that their children
will be educated,'' Cavazos said.
   The remarks upset Cruz Chavira, national chief of staff for the
League of United Latin American Citizens, based in San Antonio.
Chavira said Wednesday that scores of educators had called his
office to complain.
   ``That is incredible,'' said Chavira. ``I just can't imagine how
he can direct the guilt at parents. I don't know of a single
Hispanic not concerned about education.
   ``For him to ignore the facts _ that Hispanics have the
least-salaried people in our schools, the poorest of real wealth to
be taxed _ for him to discard those factors and lay it on the
parents, I'm getting very emotional here. He is absolutely
incorrect.''
   Cavazos' comments came after he opened a hearing on Hispanic
education, the first of five regional meetings on the subject.
   About 40 percent of Hispanics nationwide left school before high
school graduation during the 1980s, Cavazos said. The rate for all
groups in the United States is 30 percent.
   He said only 11 percent of Hispanics complete four or more years
of college by the time they are in their early 30s.
   But Cavazos didn't intend to imply that Hispanic parents don't
value education, said Etta Fielek, director of public affairs for
the Department of Education. Cavazos meant to say that the Hispanic
population lacked leadership, not values, Ms. Fielek said.
   Jose Cardenas, executive director of the Intercultural
Development Research Association, disagreed.
   ``There is a lot of leadership in the Hispanic community,'' said
Cardenas. Hispanic leaders have not been able to become involved in
the decision-making process because they have repeatedly been
stymied, he said.
   The hearing, and others to follow in Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles
and Boston, were organized by a federal task force to address what
President Bush has called the crisis in Hispanic education.

   Youths overturned patrol cars, smashed
windows and looted stores after the slaying of a black teen-ager by
a white police officer. At least five people were injured.
   About 1,000 people had rallied peacefully Wednesday night,
demanding that a special prosecutor investigate the killing of
15-year-old Phillip Pannell. Groups of teen-agers were on the
streets this morning, but there were no reports of violence.
   The boy was shot Tuesday evening after he was questioned at a
park by two officers responding to a report of a teen-ager pulling
a gun.
   Pannell died of a gunshot wound that entered his back, the
Bergen County medical examiner said. Police said Pannell had a gun,
but his friends denied it and said the killing was racially
motivated.
   Violence began Wednesday night after a candlelight vigil, when
about a dozen police officers in riot gear appeared at the edge of
the crowd to try to force people to disperse.
   Police pushed the crowd into the parking lot of the police
headquarters and some people were trampled, witnesses said. Some in
the crowd retaliated by smashing windows and doors at the police
station. They smashed the windows of three patrol cars and
overturned a fourth.
   Gangs of youths ran up and down Teaneck Road, adjoining the
station, smashing shop windows and looting some stores, including a
video rental shop.
   Police wearing riot helmets milled around a liquor store with
smashed windows to keep people from entering.
   Police said they arrested a 17-year-old man.
   Two police officers and two other people, a woman and a man,
were treated for minor injuries and released from a hospital, a
nurse said. A photographer from the Black Star photo agency was
attacked by a gang and was helped into an ambulance with a bloody
nose.
   Most of the protesters had dispersed by about 11 p.m. Teaneck
police called in reinforcements from the State Police, Bergen
County and at least five surrounding towns.
   Teaneck is an affluent community of 37,000 not far from the
George Washington Bridge linking northern New Jersey and Manhattan.
The town, which has prided itself on its racial and ethnic
diversity, is 64 percent white and 24 percent black.
   Acting Bergen County Prosecutor John Holl said a grand jury will
hear evidence on the teen-ager's shooting next week. ``There is a
lot of confusion in this case,'' he said. ``There are more
questions than answers.''
   George Powell, executive director of the Bergen County NAACP,
told demonstrators before the violence broke out that his
organization sought the suspension of Gary Spath, the officer who
shot Pannell, and would ask Gov. Jim Florio to assign a special
prosecutor.
   The governor's spokeswoman today said Florio planned to meet
with state officials and had made no decision on a special
prosecutor.
   The boy's father, also named Phillip, pleaded with the crowd to
avoid confrontation.
   ``There's no violence here, no violence,'' he told the crowd.
   Spath was treated and released from a hospital after going into
shock following the shooting. Spath and the other officer at the
scene, Wayne Blanco, were placed on sick leave pending an
investigation, Holl said.
   Earlier in the day, Holl told reporters that investigators had
found a gun on the youth's body. One of the officers was frisking
Pannell when he said he felt what he thought was a gun, Holl said.
   At that point, Pannell bolted and the officers chased him,
according to the account given by Blanco. Blanco said Spath fired
one shot that missed. Spath fired again after Pannell reached into
his jacket pocket, Blanco said.
   Friends of Pannell denied that he had a gun.
   One witness said Pannell was asking for mercy.
   ``Phil was begging. He was yelling, `Please, don't shoot!'''
said Irin Rivers, 18. ``I was just with him playing basketball. He
died just after the game was over.''
   Police rallied behind Spath, 29, who last month received his
fifth commendation from the Teaneck Policeman's Benevolent
Association since joining the department in 1982.
   ``I can't begin to express to you what a gentle soul he is,''
said Fred Greene, a retired police officer who was the first black
to join the township's police force. ``What happened here is a
tragedy.''

   James McConnell, a retired psychology
professor at the University of Michigan who wrote a widely used
textbook, has died of a heart attack. He was 64.
   McConnell died Monday at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor.
   McConnell, who studied autistic children, subliminal stimulation
and the psychology of persuasion, wrote at least eight books and
numerous articles for journals.
   His introductory psychology text, ``Understanding Human
Behavior,'' was used by more than a generation of college students
in the United States.
   In 1959, McConnell founded Worm Runners Digest, a satirical
publication that poked fun at his colleagues.
   McConnell was born in Okmulgee, Okla., and earned a bachelor's
degree from Louisiana State University and master's and doctoral
degrees from the University of Texas. He joined Michigan's faculty
in 1956 as an instructor and became a professor in 1963. He retired
in 1988.
   Survivors include an aunt and a cousin.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Friday in Ann Arbor. The
body was cremated.

   With the pomp and circumstance usually
reserved for state funerals, the rich and famous joined in paying
final respects to Ryan White, who fought prejudice against AIDS
sufferers during his long battle with the disease.
   The funeral, attended by 1,500 people and broadcast live on CNN,
showed how the articulate, poised 18-year-old had touched the
nation's heart with his pleas for understanding.
   First lady Barbara Bush led the list of dignitaries at the
ceremony, also attended by pop stars Michael Jackson and Elton John.
   The pallbearers included talk-show host Phil Donahue, John and
Los Angeles Raiders star Howie Long.
   White was buried in his favorite clothes: blue jeans, a red
shirt, blue jeans jacket and sunglasses. He had told his mother,
``I just want to be comfortable,'' before he died Sunday.
   White, who got AIDS in 1984 from a blood transfusion to treat
his hemophilia, gained national attention when he and his mother
fought attempts by frightened parents to keep him from attending
public school in his hometown, Kokomo. He later won a court battle
and began attending school in another town in 1987.
   As a 13-year-old suffering from what was then a disease known
mainly to inflict homosexuals, Ryan was able to appeal to the
nation's empathy for AIDS patients with a voice most were willing
to hear.
   ``He was the boy next door who first showed a stunned nation
that no one is safe from the risk of AIDS,'' Dr. Martin B. Kleiman,
White's physician said recently.``With an honest simplicity, his
was the voice that many, if not most, first heard.''
   ``He showed us all that we need to devote ourselves to fighting
the disease of AIDS, not those who suffer from it,'' White's
mother, Jeanne, said Wednesday.
   White's father, Wayne, who is divorced from Mrs. White, also
attended the service at the Second Presbyterian Church.
   The Rev. Raymond Probasco encouraged the mourners to continue to
seek a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``With God's help, and each of yours, we'll make AIDS a disease
and not a dirty word,'' said Probasco, pastor at Center Chapel
United Methodist Church in Muncie.
   About 300 of White's schoolmates at Hamilton Heights High School
in Arcadia, 25 miles north of Indianapolis, attended the funeral.
   The school's choir sang ``That's What Friends Are For,''
standing near the open casket at the front of the church. White was
welcomed by the school after his family moved from Kokomo.
   John, who had maintained a bedside vigil during White's final
week of life and was there when he died, led the congregation in
singing a hymn and then sang his own composition, ``Skyline
Pigeon.''
   After the ceremony, John and Jackson joined White's mother in a
final viewing of the body before the casket was closed.
   ``Mrs. White gave her son one last kiss before it was closed.
Michael remarked that the silence in the room was loud enough to
express the love and appreciation of the world,'' said Lee Solters,
a spokesman for Jackson.
   Solters said White was buried wearing a watch he had received
from Jackson, who had given White a Ford Mustang last year and had
hosted him at Jackson's California ranch during the New Year's
holiday.
   ``Ryan and his family always believed there would be a
miracle,'' Probasco said. ``But that didn't happen. I believe God
gave us that miracle in Ryan. He healed a wounded spirit in the
world and made it whole.''
   Later the funeral procession of about 150 cars and 30 motorcycle
police moved slowly through the rolling farmland to the Cicero
Cemetery. Along the way, well-wishers stood along the side of the
road, some holding signs and others holding video cameras.
   Calvin Brown watched the burial from across the road with his
two sons. His daughter, a schoolmate of White's, attended the
service.
   ``I think he made people appreciate their own chidren more. I
know he has mine,'' Brown said. ``I was hoping he'd lick this
disease.''

<TEXT>
   East Germany's new Parliament today named
Lothar de Maiziere as prime minister, backed a plan for swift
unification with West Germany and apologized to Jews for the
atrocities of the Nazis.
   The nation's first freely elected government also said a unified
Germany should at least temporarily be a part of the NATO alliance,
a key issue when the superpowers begin unification talks in the
coming weeks. And it endorsed a merger of the two German currencies
by July 1, a demand of West Germany.
   The agreement among East Germany's major political parties on
the speed of reunification, a united Germany's military alignment
and a timetable for a currency union was a huge leap forward to
creating a single Germany.
   The sweeping moves will be followed by unification talks with
West Germany and the four World War II allies that divided the
countries: the Soviet Union, United States, Britain and France.
   In a remarkable string of conciliatory gestures, Parliament
recognized the legitimacy of Poland's postwar borders and
apologized for East Germany's role in the Soviet-led invasion that
crushed reforms in Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   It also said East Germany is prepared to make reparations to
Nazi victims and urged establishment of diplomatic relations with
Israel.
   The hard-line Communist government that was toppled in October
had never formally apologized for the Holocaust. West Germany has
apologized for Nazi atrocities and has paid reparations to Jews.
   Parliament approved a declaration saying that East Germany
``admits in the name of the citizens of this country its
co-responsibility for the humiliation and expulsion and murder of
Jewish women, men and children.
   ``Jews in all the world and the people of Israel are asked to
forgive us for the wrongs they experienced. Persecuted Jews should
be granted asylum in the future in East Germany.''
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official, Michael Shilo, said the
declaration ``paves the way for further dialogue'' on establishing
diplomatic relations between the two countries.
   ``It's a very positive text. It may be overdue, but it is
nonetheless welcome,'' said Shilo, who headed an Israeli delegation
that earlier this year held two rounds of preliminary talks with
East Germany's Communist-led transition government on setting up
diplomatic ties.
   Shilo said the declaration appeared to meet Israel's two
conditions for establishing ties _ East Germany's acceptance of
moral responsibility for the Holocaust and its willingness to
negotiate reparations.
   Parliament chose de Maiziere, leader of the conservative
Christian Democrats, and installed his 24-member Cabinet on a vote
of 265-108, with nine abstentions. Eighteen members of the
400-member Parliament were absent.
   The prime minister was strongly backed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl
of West Germany. His conservative alliance won 48 percent of the
vote in March 18 elections. That gave de Maiziere a mandate to
negotiate with West Germany.
   The coalition agreement on the makeup of his government was
reached Wednesday after nearly a week of intense negotiations
cleared the way for parliamentary approval.
   The Cabinet pledged to secure prosperity, social justice and
freedom for all East German citizens, according to excerpts carried
by the East German news agency ADN.
   The agreement also paved the way for rapid reunification by
stating the merging of the two countries should be based on the
article of the West German Constitution that permits direct
incorporation of East German territory into West Germany.
   It calls for a direct 1-1 conversion of East German marks for
West German marks when the nations merge their currencies. West
Germany's central bank has proposed a 2-1 rate for all but only
small savings accounts.
   The coalition agreement also lays the foundation for East
Germany's foreign policy and says: ``It can be assumed that a
unified Germany, during a transition period and until the creation
of a collective European security system, should be a member of a
NATO that itself is transforming its military functions.''
   The statement endorses Western demands that a united Germany be
part of NATO. The Soviet Union wants a new Germany to be neutral,
but this week proposed that it have joint membership in NATO and
the Warsaw Pact. West Germany now is in NATO and East Germany is
part of the Warsaw Pact.
   An increasingly restive workforce worried about rampant
unemployment associated with reunification planned demonstrations
today.
   About 20 tractors and farms trucks, some bearing signs saying
``Market Economy for Farmers?'' rolled into the parking lot of
Parliament to demonstrate their concern over loss of state
subsidies and fear the government-owned land they till will fall
into private hands.
   But telephone and other electronics workers fearing unemployment
did not follow through with their appeal for a three-hour strike in
the capital.
   Approval of the de Maiziere government clears the way for the
start of talks with West Germany on merging their divergent
economic and political systems after four decades of separation.
   A West German government spokesman said Wednesday that Kohl
wants to sign a treaty on monetary union between the two states by
May 6, with the currency merger to go into effect by July 7.

Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven demonstrators were arrested for
violating a court order that restricts protests over the firing of
Selma's first black school superintendent.
   The arrests Wednesday occurred one day after Lauderdale County
Circuit Judge Leslie Johnson issued an order restricting
demonstrators to the sidewalk in front of City Hall. It also
prohibits them from encouraging car horn honking, marching around
the building or holding picnics in the lobby.
   Four protesters were arrested outside City Hall and three others
were arrested Wednesday afternoon after a scuffle outside a
restaurant involving three policemen.
   The protests have been continuing since mid-December, when the
white-controlled school board refused to extend the contract of
Superintendent Norward Roussell. Roussell has filed a racial
discrimination lawsuit against the white school board members who
voted not to extend his contract, which expires in June.
   Police Chief Melvin Summerlin said the first arrests occurred
after a group of protesters set up chairs on the sidewalk in front
of City Hall, blocking a loading zone in violation of the order,
and refused to move. Summerlin said he ordered the group to
disperse but he was ignored.
   The incident at the restaurant apparently was sparked when a
driver was cited for blowing his horn about a block away from City
Hall.
   Attorney Rose Sanders said the people arrested had been abiding
by the court order.
   ``Those people were exercising their constitutional rights and
the actions by the city against them were immoral and unjust,'' she
said.
   Several motorists were given tickets for blowing their car horns
as they drove by City Hall. Mayor Joe Smitherman said officials
believe the motorists were deliberately testing the court order.

   A fugitive arrested in the 1976 car bombing
that killed the former Chilean ambassador was being held without
bond awaiting trial in Washington, D.C.
   Jose Dionisio Suarez y Esquivel, 51, arrested at his St.
Petersburg home early Wednesday, waived his rights to a bond
hearing before a federal magistrate here on charges of conspiracy
to murder a foreign official.
   Suarez is accused of providing the explosives and detonating
devices in the explosion that killed former Chilean Ambassador
Orlando Letelier and business colleague Ronni Moffitt as they drove
to work in Washington on Sept. 21, 1976.
   U.S. officials said they expect the new Chilean government to
prosecute top intelligence officials of the former military
government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet on charges of planning
Letelier's assassination, The New York Times reported today. The
killings long have been a sore point in relations between the
United States and Chile.
   In Washington, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., welcomed the
arrest and commended the FBI, but said, ``Unfortunately, the
masterminds of this atrocity remain at large in Chile. I hope and
expect that the new democratic government in that nation will do
all in its power to bring them to justice.''
   A former Chilean diplomat, Jose Miguel Barros, testified in a
Chilean court last year that Letelier's assassination was ordered
by Chilean army Gen. Juan Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, who headed
the Chilean National Intelligence Agency.
   Pinochet stepped down as president last month after the election
of a civilian, Patricio Aylwin.
   U.S. marhals said Suarez would be flown to Washington as early
as Saturday. If convicted, he could face life in prison.
   FBI agents said Suarez had been leading a secretive, cautious
life in St. Petersburg, rarely even leaving the house.
   ``To our knowledge, he hasn't been employed in the last 12 to 14
years,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Terry Furr.
   But his 30-year-old wife Elizabeth said Suarez worked at home as
an artist and never realized his face had been plastered in post
offices and courthouses around the country for more than a decade.
   ``No one ever notified him he was a fugitive,'' said Mrs.
Suarez, a hospital administration employee and mother of a
15-month-old boy. She said they have lived either in Tampa or St.
Petersburg throughout their nine-year marriage.
   Letelier served as Chilean ambassador to the United States in
1971-1973, during the presidency of Salvador Allende, who was
ousted by Pinochet in a coup. Letelier had begun to emerge as a
leading international critic of Pinochet when he and Moffitt were
assassinated.
   Michael V. Townley, a U.S. citizen who also was an employee of
the Chilean intelligence agency, was arrested in April 1978.
Townley was extradited to the United States, confessed to planting
the bomb on the order of superiors and spent 40 months in prison.
   According to the FBI, Townley, Suarez and fugitive Virgilio
Pablo Paz built the bomb used in the assassination. Suarez
allegedly provided the explosives and detonators and purchased the
bomb parts.
   A federal grand jury also indicted three Chilean army personnel
in connection with the case.
   Maj. Armando Fernandez Larios pleaded guilty to being an
accessory after the fact to Letelier's death and was sentenced to
22 months in custody. The Justice Department has failed to obtain
the extradition of two others.

<TEXT>
   A man convicted of murdering a family of four
and carving a woman's nearly full-term fetus out of her womb has
been sentenced to die in Florida's electric chair.
   Newton Slawson, 35, showed no emotion Wednesday as Hillsborough
Circuit Judge Robert Bonanno followed the jury's recommendation and
sentenced him to four death sentences plus 30 years in prison.
   ``He wasn't surprised. We weren't surprised,'' said defense
attorney Brian Donerly.
   Slawson had pleaded involuntary cocaine intoxication, claiming
that Gerald Wood, a co-worker at a compost company, had secretly
slipped some crack cocaine in his beer during a visit.
   But the jury recommended the death sentence after convicting him
last month of four counts of first-degree murder and one
manslaughter count in the April 11, 1989 slayings of Wood, 23, his
pregnant wife, Peggy, 21, and their children, Jennifer, 3, and
Glendon, 2. The manslaughter conviction was for the death of Mrs.
Wood's eight-month fetus.
   Bleeding heavily, Mrs. Wood managed to drag herself next door to
her parents' house and tell her mother that Slawson did it.
   Wilma Williams, Mrs. Wood's mother, said afterward she couldn't
say she was happy at the sentence. ``He has a mother, too, and I
can feel for her.''
   Slawson didn't deny the killings, but testified that he didn't
remember them. He said he came to at the Wood apartment with a gun
in his hand, found bodies around him and decided to try to save the
fetus.
   ``I used my knife and I slit her open,'' Slawson testified.
``And when I got into her and I had opened the uterus and saw the
child and saw the damage to the child, I knew there was no way that
baby was going to live.''
   Slawson said he left and reloaded his .357-caliber Magnum to
kill himself. But he wasn't sure if it all was a dream, so he drove
back past the Woods' apartment, saw police and was arrested.
   During the trial, Slawson's mother testified she routinely
abused her son when he was a child. She often tied him up and beat
him, and locked him in a closet until he curled up in a fetal
position.
   ``I whipped him for no reason at all,'' Tully Slawson said. ``I
was sick and he was my whipping boy.''

<HEAD>Review With No Book Embarrasses Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A journalism student's review of a
non-existent American book caused a flush of embarrassment to a
leading newspaper, which missed the pun and printed it.
   The review of a novel called ``Surface'' said it was about a
future when writers no longer write books, only reviews, because
people have become too superficial to read literary works.
   The fictional review was published by Goteborgsposten, Sweden's
second-largest morning daily. It was written by Ulf Eliasson, a
journalism student who had contributed to the paper before.
   The episode prompted amusement and outrage in the journalism
world.
   In an acrid comment to Journalisten, the Swedish Journalists'
Union paper, a cultural editor from Goteborgsposten called
Eliasson's prank stupid and said it ``discredited all those serious
cultural journalists who wants to discuss media and art honestly.''
   Others defended Eliasson. One wrote a letter to Journalisten
calling it one of ``the funniest things I ever read. ... If this
wonderful effort by Ulf would undermine cultural journalism, there
is not much to it.''
   The review said the book was ``the literary debut by 90-year-old
Friedrich Cass, published by Aquarius, of Denver, Colo.'' Cass,
Eliasson said later, should have been a tip, since it means
``lousy'' in Swedish when spelled with a K.

<TEXT>
   The reactor aboard Japan's only nuclear-powered
ship was shut down for more than two hours Thursday after operators
discovered problems with a switch used to move its control rods,
the Atomic Energy Research Institute said.
   Kazuyoshi Haga, spokesman for the government-affiliated
institute, said the shutdown came during a test of the reactor
aboard the 8,214-ton Mutsu.
   It was the fifth time the reactor has been shut down since the
institute began testing it March 29, Haga said. The reactor had not
been used since it developed a radiation leak in its protective
shield on the ship's maiden voyage in 1974.
   After developing the leak, the ship drifted 50 days before
residents of Mutsu, its home port, allowed it to return
temporarily. The ship has been docked at Sekinehama, 360 miles
north of Tokyo, since 1988.
   The ship's reactor, including the defective shield, was
extensively remodeled after the leak.
   In Thursday's shutdown, operators manually halted the reactor
and found that a portion of the switch was faulty, Haga said. The
switch was replaced and the reactor resumed operations, he said.
   Institute officials say the reactor will be tested further and
the ship will make several test voyages aimed at obtaining data for
possible future development of nuclear-powered commercial vessels.
   Following the tests, the Mutsu, with an output capacity of
36,000 kilowatts, is to be retired.

<TEXT>
   Britain's annual inflation rate jumped to 8.1
percent in March from 7.5 percent in February, largely because of
increases in mortgage rates, the government said Thursday.
   The increase brought inflation to its highest level since July,
when it was 8.2 percent. Unemployment held steady at 5.6 percent in
March, the government said.
   Britain's inflation rate, the worst among the major
industrialized nations, is expected to move up to 9 percent before
decreasing. Curbing resurgent inflation is Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's No.1 economic priority, and 15 percent interest rates
are her weapon.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major has said that a new
per-capita tax called the community charge, introduced this month,
will boost the inflation rate.
   There have been widespread protests against the community
charge, which replaces a property tax system used to pay for local
services.
   New excise taxes also will push up the index in the next few
months, the department said.

   Gunmen slipped into a hospital
early Thursday and shot to death a local politician who had been
seriously wounded two days earlier in an assassination attempt,
police said.
   Investigators blamed the slaying on the 'ndrangheta, the
Calabrian Mafia.
   Shortly after midnight, at least two men entered the recovery
room of Riuniti Hospital and fired three shots into Vincenzo
Reitano, 29. The assailants escaped.
   Police said the gunmen took advantage of the lack of night
security at the hospital. They used a key to get into the locked
room where Reitano was sleeping, leading investigators to assume
they had accomplices working inside the hospital.
   Reitano was shot and wounded Tuesday in the nearby town of
Fiumara di Muro, where he serves on the town council. He had been
expected to be released from the hospital shortly.
   The deputy major of Fiumara di Muro was assassinated last March
by Mafia gunmen.

<TEXT>
   A jury Thursday convicted a mild-mannered
former accountant and Sunday school teacher of the premeditated
murder of his wife, mother and three children in their suburban
mansion 18 years ago.
   A gaunt, white-haired John E. List, 64, showed no emotion as the
verdict was announced after the jury deliberated almost nine hours
over two days.
   His sentencing is scheduled for May 1.
   Defense attorney Elijah L. Miller Jr. acknowledged in opening
arguments that List committed the killings on Nov. 9, 1971. Miller
sought a verdict of second-degree murder based on a contention that
List had a mental disease or defect.
   The jury found List guilty of five counts of first-degree
murder, an offense that carries a life term with no parole until
after 15 years. Second-degree murder would have allowed parole
after a third of the 30-year maximum sentence.
   List was arrested in Richmond, Va., in June after a telephoned
tip to the ``America's Most Wanted'' television show, which had
broadcast his case.
   His arrest ended a secret life as a fugitive spent mostly in
Denver in which List again took up his profession, returned to the
Lutheran church and remarried.
   Authorities found the bodies of his wife Helen, 45; mother Alma,
84; daughter Patricia, 16; and sons John, 15, and Frederick, 13, in
their 18-room Westfield mansion on Dec. 7, 1971.
   Dirgelike religious music was playing over an intercom system,
the heat had been lowered to 50 degrees and List left a series of
chillingly matter-of-fact notes explaining his actions and
apologizing.
   Two pictures of List emerged during the trial.
   Witnesses testified he was a mild-mannered, deeply pious and
strictly raised Lutheran born in a hard-working German immigrant
community in Bay City, Mich. He was a history buff deeply involved
in his church who loved to play war games.
   But other evidence clouded the image of the strait-laced father
and ordinary suburban family.
   List told his psychiatrist he watched erotic films to become
sexually aroused. Witnesses told investigators shortly after the
bodies were discovered that Patricia was interested in witchcraft.
List said he feared she would start smoking marijuana.
   His sister-in-law's husband, Gene Syfert, testified that List
was fascinated with unsolved mysteries.
   And List's wife was dying, turned psychotic and bed-ridden by
late-stage syphilis caught from her first husband in 1943.
   Defense psychiatric experts testified that an
``obsessive-compulsive'' personality disorder combined with List's
twisted sense of religion and a series of a pressures on his life
made him unable to deliberate over his decision.
   List felt unable to support his family and dreaded the prospect
of welfare. He was oppressed by his wife's illness and the shame it
caused. His daughter's acting ambitions concerned him. And he
feared his family was falling away from their religion and facing
damnation, the defense contended.
   Eleanor J. Clark, a Union County assistant prosecutor, called
List a ``hideous angel of death'' who carefully planned the
killings and deliberated his options right until the end.
   The state presented 41 witnesses in 2{ days, most of them
investigators, forensic experts and neighbors and acquaintances.
Their testimony was intended to show that List meticulously planned
the killings.
   A prosecution psychiatrist testified that List had an obsessive
personality, but suffered from little more than a mid-life crisis.
   On the day of the slayings, witnesses said List ate meals before
and after shooting his victims, even cleaning the house and washing
the dishes.
   He calmly withdrew money from the bank and left instructions for
funerals and for wrapping up his financial affairs, even leaving a
note for the milkman and labeling a desk drawer, which contained
the pistols he used, ``guns and ammo.''
   List then zig-zagged across country by train before settling in
Denver because, he told a psychiatrist, he always liked the
mountains. After working as a cook, he returned to his accounting
profession and moved to Midlothian, Va., a Richmond suburb, in 1988.
   He was known to spend time watching television. One of his
favorite show was said to be ``America's Most Wanted.''

   An explosion at an acetylene plant
today caused three injuries and briefly knocked out electricity to
3,000 customers when debris hit a power line, authorities said.
   None of the injuries was serious. The blast at the Big Three
Industries plant, which had only two employees, shook surrounding
buildings, witnesses said.
   Plant foreman Robert Bye, 27, was in good condition at St. John
Medical Center in Tulsa, said hospital spokesman Barrett Waller. He
didn't have any details about Bye's injuries.
   Two people who worked at a nearby glass factory were treated for
minor injuries and released, said Frank Mitchell, manager of Kerr
Glass.
   The cause of the explosion could not be determined immediately.
Al Martin, a salesman who answered the phone at Big Three
Industries offices in Tulsa, said company officials were at the
scene and not available for comment.
   A woman who answered the phone earlier who asked not to be
identified said of the two employees at the plant: ``We've talked
to one of them and he said he was OK and that the other one was
fine, too.''
   The plant fills tanks with acetylene, a highly flammable gas,
for use in welding.
   Fire Chief Fred Shawger said the fire department evacuated a
half-mile area around the plant for an hour because of the
potential of other explosions.
   ``There was a lot of metal flying,'' Shawger said. ``It was a
metal building which just blew up and sprayed shrapnel.''
   The 7:43 a.m. explosion knocked out power to about 3,000
customers from Sand Springs to just south of Bartlesville, said
Brian Miller, spokesman for Public Service Co. of Oklahoma.
   He said power was restored to all but about 200 customers within
the hour.
   ``Apparently some sheet metal that was part of this building
flew up and got in our lines,'' Miller said.
   Tom Watson, manager of Morrow-Gill Lumber Co., said the
explosion damaged part of his ceiling. ``We've got eight-foot
florescent lights on the floor. It completely tore down part of the
ceiling and warped all of our ceiling structure.''
   Sue Clark of the city public works office, which is about 300
yards from the plant, said employees thought their building had
exploded.
   ``Stuff fell out of the ceiling and the floor shook, so we ran
out of the building,'' she said. ``There was just black smoke and
debris coming up in the air.''

   Merchants eager to cash in on Californians'
seismic jitters hawked survival kits, wind-up radios and furniture
fasteners at an earthquake bazaar.
   The several dozen vendors at the downtown sale credited brisk
business Wednesday to increased anxiety following October's San
Francisco Bay area quake.
   ``When there has been a recent earthquake ... it really is good
for us,'' said Jeannie Rothfuss of Marathon Medical Corp., where
earthquake kits have been a big seller since the devastating quake.
   Hundreds of people browsed at the Second Annual Downtown
Earthquake Preparedness Action Council Earthquake Education and
Vendor Fair in the Arco Plaza subterranean shopping center.
   For $150, Steve Ballenberg offered a 14{-pound duffel bag of
survival goodies described as ``the state-of-the-art'' emergency
kit. Dave Wallace of Survivor Industries Inc., passed out hundreds
of water samples, inviting passersby to, ``Have a drink on me!''
   Those afraid of running out of batteries could spend $40 on a
flashlight-radio that plays for 30 minutes on 200 wind-up cranks.

<TEXT>
   A car bomb attack that killed 20 people,
including eight members of an elite police anti-drug squad, was
part of a terrorist campaign being waged by drug traffickers,
anonymous callers said.
   Police, fearing more attacks, set up dozens of checkpoints and
increased patrols in Medellin today. Cocaine traffickers have
targeted police in the northern city of 2 million in retaliation
for the government's anti-drug campaign.
   The bomb, packing 220 pounds of dynamite, exploded Wednesday
beside a crowded highway as a truck carrying 21 officers of the
elite police unit passed by. The explosion badly damaged buildings
and cars nearby.
   Police said the death toll from the blast rose to 20 early today
after four civilians who had been critically wounded in the attack
died at hospitals. More than 100 people were wounded, including the
other 13 police officers in the truck.
   ``We are expecting more attacks by the Medellin cartel, and for
that reason we are increasing security measures in a drastic
manner,'' a Medellin police spokesman said in a telephone
interview. He refused to give his name.
   Police also increased increased vehicle checkpoints in Bogota,
the capital, where one week ago police deactivated a truck bomb
packing 1,650 pounds of dynamite.
   In December, traffickers exploded a 1,100-pound truck bomb at
security police headquarters in Bogota, and 63 people were killed.
   Anonymous callers to newspapers said Wednesday's attack was
carried out by the Extraditables, a name used by drug traffickers
who are fighting government efforts to extradite them to the United
States.
   The callers warned that more bombings would be staged in
retaliation for what they claimed was the torture and murder of
drug traffickers by the police. The government has denied the
allegations of brutality.
   ``We accept responsibility for what happened (in Medellin),'' a
caller to the El Tiempo newspaper said late Wednesday. ``If the
torture continues, we are not going to leave a single policeman
alive.''
   The chief of police operations, Gen. Octavio Vargas, denied the
traffickers' accusations in a radio interview today with the RCN
network. He said Medellin cocaine cartel leader Pablo Escobar had
begun killing his own people because he feared betrayal.
   In Bogota, the news program ``TV Hoy'' reported that senior
police sources said the bombing was ordered by Medellin cocaine
cartel leader Pablo Escobar. The program quoted police as saying
that they had irrefutable evidence of Escobar's involvement.
   The unit the slain police officers belonged is charged with
battling terrorism by drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas. The
force has received training in Colombia from U.S. and British
security personnel in recent months.
   The explosion occurred as thousands of Colombians drove out of
Medellin to begin Holy Week vacations. Radio reports said it left a
7-foot-deep hole in the highway.
   In the port of Cartagena, President Virgilio Barco said he was
``sorry to receive such bad news,'' the radio network RCN reported.
   ``Colombia's security forces will not rest,'' Interior Minister
Horacio Serpa said in an interview with the ``Noticiero National''
news program. ``The government will pursue criminals no matter what
sacrifice is involved.''
   Authorities say Escobar has placed a price of $4,290 on the head
of each police officer in Medellin, and they blame gunmen working
for the Medellin cartel for the murders of 19 police officers last
week.
   The traffickers said in a communique Friday that they would step
up their war against police and the country's political and
business elite.
   Late last month, the cartel promised to bomb Bogota because the
government has refused to stop extraditing suspected drug
traffickers to the United States. Barco's administration has
extradited 15 drug suspects in the last eight months.
   Security forces blame Escobar for masterminding the bombing
campaign and other attacks that began shortly after the government
intensified its U.S.-backed crackdown on traffickers in August.
   More than 200 people were killed in bombings and assassinations
blamed on drug bosses before they declared a unilateral truce on
Jan. 17.
   But the government then resumed extraditions of drug suspects to
the United States, ending a two-month hiatus, and the traffickers
said they were renewing their terror campaign because their offer
to negotiate peace had been rejected.

<TEXT>
   An Interal Revenue Service car parked
outside the federal courthouse was ``booted'' for unpaid parking
tickets, forcing tax collectors to fork over $122.50 to set it free.
   Officers can immobilize any vehicle by locking a device on a
tire if four parking tickets go unpaid for 30 days, said Gertrude
Bradley, clerical supervisor for the the city parking division.
   The IRS had to pay $95 for five tickets, a $25 removal fee plus
$2.50 for processing to get the boot taken off.
   With April 15th's tax-filing deadline closing in, courthouse
employees were chuckling about the IRS' misfortune Wednesday.
   But the agency was not amused.
   ``We're not pleased with it,'' said spokesman Holger Euringer.
   ``No one is ever happy to see a boot on their car, and that
includes the federal government. But we can certainly understand
why some taxpayers would find that rather humorous.''
   Euringer said the agency would track down the employees who got
the tickets and seek reimbursement.

   A fire that may have been set by radicals opposed
to the expansion of Tokyo's international airport swept through the
home of an aircraft parts maker Thursday and killed his wife,
police said.
   The executive, Atsumasa Kamakura, was seriously injured in the
predawn blaze at the couple's home in Kamakura, west of Tokyo,
police said.
   Kubota, 66, is an executive of Japan Aircraft Manufacturing Co.
His wife, Fumie, was 53.
   The fire broke out shortly before 3 a.m., spread quickly and
destroyed the home.
   A police official said investigators found timer devices,
batteries and cables in the debris. ``We suspect that the blaze was
set by the extremists,'' said the official, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   He was referring to radicals opposed to the expansion of the
airport. They have been linked to attacks on facilities and
equipment related to the project.
   However, officials at Kubota's company said it was not directly
involved in the airport expansion.
   The government plans to build a new terminal and two additional
runways by the end of March 1991 at an estimated cost of $3.8
billion.
   Eight farmers still live on the planned expansion site and
refuse to leave.
   Local farmers and their supporters, including radicals who have
used the issue for anti-government activities, have been resisting
the government's plan to expropriate farmland for the expansion
project.

   A 6-year-old girl was shot and killed as she
slept in her bed after a barrage of bullets from a passing car
pierced her bedroom wall, police said.
   The girl, whose identity was withheld, was struck in the chest
last Wednesday by a large-caliber bullet that went through an
exterior wall and then through her bedroom wall, said Sgt. J.D.
Evans of the homicide squad.
   She was dead on arrival at Ben Taub Hospital.
   Neighbors told police they heard up to nine gunshots, then saw a
car speeding away on the dimly lit street. There are at least six
bullet holes in the house's front wall.
   The eight children and four adults in the house fell to the
floor when the shooting began and none was hit, police said.
   Police believe a 9 mm semiautomatic pistol was used.
   A neighbor reported several shots were fired at the same house
Friday when an intoxicated man could not find his car.
   Police said they did not know if the shootings were related, but
they were looking for a boyfriend of a woman who lived at the house
for questioning. Police said the two had quarreled earlier in the
evening.

   Equipment ordered by Iraq and impounded at an
English port could be used as a barrel of a large artillery gun,
the Customs and Excise Office said today.
   Arms experts said a gun of the size seized by Customs _
130-feet-long with a 40-inch bore _ could fire nuclear or chemical
warheads as far as Tehran or Tel Aviv, each within 350 miles of
Iraq's borders.
   The manufacturer and the Iraqi government insisted that the
equipment was a pipe intended for use in a petrochemical plant.
   Customs officers seized the equipment Tuesday night, and the
agency said it was investigating whether there had been a violation
of the British embargo on arms shipments to Iraq.
   ``We are now satisfied that this equipment is covered by the
Munitions List of the Export of Goods Control Order 1989,'' Customs
chief Douglas Tweddle said this afternoon.
   ``There is no question it could be used as a barrel of a large
artillery gun to fire a projectile of some considerable size. It is
definitely subject to export licensing controls.
   ``The goods are now seized. Investigations will continue to
prove intent and to establish whether offenses have been
committed,'' Tweddle said.
   He said the gun's capability was confirmed by Ministry of
Defense experts who inspected the cargo today on the docks at
Middlesbrough in northeastern England.
   Executives at Sheffield Forgemasters, which has been identified
as the manufacturer, were in a meeting and not immediately
available for comment, according to a woman who answered the
telephone at the plant.
   On March 28, customs officials seized U.S.-made atomic bomb
triggers that were bound for Iraq. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
last week threatened to use missiles armed with chemical warheads
against Israel if it attacked any Iraqi facilities. Iraq has
confirmed it has chemical weapons but denied that it is seeking a
nuclear capability.
   The seizure of the triggers and Iraq's execution on March 15 of
a British reporter convicted of spying have soured British-Iraqi
relations. Iraq has accused Britain and Israel of orchestrating an
anti-Iraqi campaign.
   ``Everything that is said about these pipes is baseless,'' said
Naiel Hassan, press attache at the Iraqi Embassy in London.
   ``The British and the Israelis are trying to make a fuss about
this matter. Even the company itself said that these pipes are used
for only petrochemical industries,'' Hassan said.
   A spokesman for Sheffield Forgemasters, which has been
identified in news reports as the manufacturer, said earlier today
that the government Department of Trade and Industry approved the
order.
   ``The Department of Trade saw specifications, drawings,
everything. We were supplying a pipe for a petrochemical production
unit,'' said company spokesmn Tony Peck.
   Sheffield Forgemasters' chief executive, Phillip Wright, said
earlier today that his company had been approached by Iraq to make
a gun barrel, but the company took the government's advice and
refused.
   ``What we made were a series of tubes and they are not like any
sort of a gun,'' Wright said. ``We do make gun barrels and in fact
they are immediately recognizable.''
   A spokesman for the Department of Trade said it was department
policy not to comment on dealings with individual companies.
   A Customs spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
officers raided offices in the northern English steel-making city
of Sheffield and in the industrial city of Birmingham in central
England on Wednesday.
   He said they ``took away papers relevant to the specifications,
ordering and delivery arrangements for this piece of equipment.''
   A spokesman for Walter Somers Ltd. in Halesowen, near
Birmingham, said Customs officers seized documents there on
Wednesday. The spokesman said the company produced some steel
piping ``of very much smaller dimensions'' for Iraq in 1988 and had
no pending orders from the country.
   The unidentified Customs spokesman said the goods were consigned
to Iraq and were being loaded aboard a ship chartered by the Iraqi
Maritime Agency.
   Britain banned all arms sales to Iraq and its enemy Iran
following the outbreak of the eight-year Persian Gulf War.
   There has been a cease-fire since 1988, but Iran and Iraq are
still not officially at peace and the British embargo remains.
   Two weeks ago, Customs officers seized 40 American-made
components for nuclear bomb triggers as they were being put aboard
an Iraqi Airways flight to Baghdad. Five people were arrested;
three are facing charges, one was deported and one was released.
   The Iraqis are widely believed to be building a nuclear bomb,
and there has been increasing concern about the country's weapons
program.

<HEAD>Ratings Down for Morning Shows, But ABC Wins Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ratings dropped for all three network morning
shows last week, but ABC's ``Good Morning America'' continued in
first, winning its 14th consecutive week, A.C. Nielsen Co. audience
estimates showed Thursday.
   ABC's show averaged a 4.5 rating, down 0.3 from the previous
week.
   NBC's once-dominant ``Today'' show, which fell into second place
after co-host Jane Pauley left at the end of last year, took the
biggest drop. It averaged a 3.3 compared with 3.8 the previous week.
   ``CBS This Morning'' remained in a distant third, averaging a
2.4 rating, down one-tenth of a point from the week ending April 1.
Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   A ``Today'' spokeswoman, Mary Neagoy, attributed part of the
``Today'' drop to last week's national switch to daylight-saving
time. She said morning show ratings tend to go down initially when
the change occurs.
   Meanwhile, negotiations are still under way for a replacement
for ``Sunday Today'' co-anchor Maria Shriver, who left the show
last week. Mary Alice Williams is expected to succeed her.
   No announcement on Shriver's successor is expected until next
week, said Jerry Solomon, executive producer. He said Michelle
Gillen, a New York-based correspondent, would would co-anchor this
Sunday's ``Today.''

<TEXT>
   With his strong ties to West Germany, the
first freely elected leader of East Germany, Lothar de Maiziere, is
well-equipped to lead the former Communist bastion to unification
and democracy.
   De Maiziere was confirmed as prime minister by the country's
first democratically elected Parliament on Thursday after leading
the Alliance for Germany to victory in elections March 18.
   The 50-year-old lawyer's political skills were tested in two
weeks of tough negotiations with other mainstream parties that
resulted in a broad governing coalition. The agreement gives de
Maiziere a two-thirds majority needed in Parliament to pass
constitutional changes required for quick unification with West
Germany.
   The new prime minister was little known in the West before he
assumed leadership of the Christian Democratic Union, or CDU, on
Nov. 10, after the opening of East Germany's borders.
   De Maiziere, who is married with four children, belongs to a
prominent Huguenot family with strong links to West Germany. His
uncle, Ulrich, held a top post in the West German army, and his
cousin Thomas, is spokeman for the CDU's sister party in West
Berlin.
   De Maiziere was born March 2, 1940, in Nordhausen, now an East
German town close to the West German border.
   Like many Germans, he stayed away from politics immediately
after the trauma of the Nazi era and World War II.
   His first love was music, and his proficiency in playing the
viola won him a place in various orchestras in East Berlin in the
1960s.
   But the musician was drawn to law. He earned a degree from East
Berlin's prestigious Humboldt University in 1975.
   De Maiziere made a name for himself by defending conscientious
objectors and independent political activists.
   For many years, he headed the Lutheran Church Council.
   But the lawyer and musician was also drawn to politics. De
Maiziere joined the Christian Democrats in 1956 when they were
allied with the Communist Party, but he never numbered among the
top ranks of party officials.
   When Communist rule crumbled under popular pressure last fall,
East Germany needed credible politicians to manage the crisis and
help with the merger of the two Germanys. De Maiziere became deputy
prime minister in the caretaker government of reform-minded
Communist Hans Modrow.
   The governing Christian Democrats of West Germany at first
snubbed the weaker East German CDU and de Maiziere, fearing they
were too tainted by long links with the Communists.
   De Maiziere boldly risked alienating voters by acknowledging
early on that the CDU had received funds from the Communist Party.
He earned credibility.
   Once accepted by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party, de
Maiziere fell in line with the West German CDU's wishes and came
out in favor of quick unification.
   With a clear mandate to seek unification, de Maiziere set about
opening coalition talks under the shadow of links with the hated
Stasi, as the disbanded Communist secret police was known. There
have been allegations many members of the new Parliament, including
de Maiziere, collaborated with the Stasi. De Maiziere denied the
allegations.
   He also has faced charges he is too close to the Kohl government
and will not protect East German interests during unification talks
later this year.
   However, he dispelled some doubts when he opposed a West German
central bank proposal to convert East German marks to West German
marks at a 2-1 conversion rate. De Maiziere said he wants a 1-1
conversion.

   Superstitions generally cast Friday the 13th
into a bad luck day for the so-called ``triskaidekaphobics'' who
fear it, but the number 13 also has some good signs.
   In this Liberty Bell city the 13 colonies declared independence,
and the 13-letter slogan ``E Pluribus Unum'' is placed on U.S.
coins.
   Also Philadelphia is the headquarters for the Friday the 13th
club, founded 54 years ago by 13 men, limits membership to 13 and
only meets on Friday the 13th.
   ``We replace members only when someone dies or leaves town,''
member Arthur Klein said of the club, whose theme is to defy all
the superstitutions.
   This Friday the 13th, the club will gather at 8:13 a.m. in a
paint warehouse where chairman Max Buten has assembled some
ladders. Not only will members walk under the ladders. They also
will open black umbrellas, break mirrors and spill salt. They may
even have a few black cats.
   Scared?
   ``Not us,'' said Klein, who wouldn't say if he would be carrying
a rabbit's foot or would be knocking on wood when walking under the
ladders.
   ``As soon as this meeting's over I'm asking for a substantial
premium reduction on my warehouse's catastrophe insurance,'' Buten
said.
   Nordic myth has it that number 13 first became unlucky a few
thousand years ago when, at a banquet of a dozen benevolent gods,
an uninvited bad god intruded and started a fight that killed the
most popular god.
   Another explanation for calling it a bad day was that Jesus was
crucified on a Friday and there were 13 at his Last Supper.
   Many buildings omit 13 when numbering floors. Some hospitals
don't have a room 13. Some people won't start a trip on the 13th.
   Klein isn't worried about defying the superstitions.
   ``Hey, we've been meeting every Friday the 13th, and nothing's
stopped us yet,'' he said.
   There's a target date for stopping, though.
   The last scheduled meeting, according to the club's charter, is
Friday, Oct. 13, 2000.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Down Two Months in Row</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A late-starting Easter selling season and a
continuing auto slump combined to push March retail sales down for
the second straight month, the government said Thursday.
   Sales fell 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $148.6 billion
after a 0.3 percent drop in February, the Commerce Department
reported.
   The drop was the steepest in five months and marked the first
back-to-back sales slump since October and November 1986. Only food
stores posted higher sales.
   ``Consumers ... seem to be much more wary of spending money than
they had been,'' said economist S. Jay Levy of Levy Economic
Forecasts in Chappaqua, N.Y. ``With home prices in many areas of
the country falling, I think this gives pause to many people.''
   Stock prices rose immediately after the report's release. The
new indication of continued sluggish economic growth suggested less
upward pressure on interest rates than had been feared lately.
   However, analysts pointed to a number of mitigating factors that
softened the news:
   _February sales, originally reported as falling 0.9 percent and
later revised to a minus 0.8 percent, were revised upward again,
this time sharply.
   _Both months followed a very strong January increase of 2.8
percent.
   _Easter this year falls three weeks later than it did last year.
Some clothing and department store sales that would have occurred
in March with an earlier Easter were thus shifted to April.
   ``March was weak but, to me, it was a deceptive weakness,'' said
economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. ``It's another
one of those more-of-the-same reports. ... The consumer is sort of
doing what the economy is doing. He's plodding ahead, but not in a
straight line.''
   Sales in the first three months of the year were up 5.5 percent
from the same period of 1989. However, some of the gain was
attributed to unseasonably mild weather and auto discounting in
January.
   ``I think (first quarter) sales borrowed from the spring and
that could show up in (depressing) the April number,'' said
economist Maury N. Harris of Paine Webber Inc.
   Retail sales, which account for about a third of all economic
activity, are closely watched as a barometer of economic health.
   In recent months, consumer demand, particularly for high-priced
items such as autos, has been weakened by the Federal Reserve
Board's policy of using high interest rates to dampen demand and
consequently inflationary pressures.
   Car dealers and auto parts stores reported their fifth sales
decline in six months. Sales totaled $30.7 billion in March, down
1.4 percent after a 6.5 percent drop in February.
   Excluding the volatile auto sector, sales fell 0.4 percent in
March after strong gains of 1.5 percent in February and 1.1 percent
in January.
   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last
three or more years, slumped 0.8 percent in March after a 2.7
percent drop a month earlier. Sales of non-durable goods fell 0.5
percent after rising 1.1 percent in February.
   In other sectors, March sales fell 1 percent at department and
other general merchandise stores; 0.5 percent at clothing stores;
0.1 percent at furniture outlets; 0.8 percent at building supply,
hardware and garden stores; 1.7 percent at gasoline stations; 1.5
percent at restaurants and bars, and 0.9 percent at drug stores.
They rose 0.2 percent at food stores.

<HEAD>Wool, Mohair Producers Getting Subsidies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Wool and mohair producers are getting about
$100 million in subsidies because 1989 market prices fell below the
federal support level, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The $100 million in payments, which are to begin immediately,
will be split equally between wool and mohair producers, officials
said.
   Last year's federal support level for shorn wool was $1.77 per
pound, but the national average market price was only $1.24 per
pound. Mohair supports were set at nearly $4.59 per pound, while
the 1989 average market price was $1.58 per pound.
   The USDA announcement on wool and mohair subsidies followed a
report this week by the General Accounting Office urging Congress
to consider the need for the wool and mohair program as lawmakers
deliberate the 1990 farm bill.
   Since price supports for wool and mohair were established by the
National Wool Act was passed in 1954, federal subsidies to
producers have totaled about $2 billion, the GAO said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush expressed solidarity with
Colombian President Virgilio Barco on Thursday and condemned drug
lords for a bombing that killed 16 people, including eight members
of an elite anti-drug police unit.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush wanted to
express sympathy and condolences to Colombians for Wednesday's
attack and ``reiterate our determination to assist President Barco
and the people of Colombia to win the battle against the drug
terrorists.''
   The bomb, packing 220 pounds of dynamite, exploded beside a
crowded highway in the northern city of Medellin, a headquarters of
drug lords, as a truck carrying 21 officers of the elite police
unit passed by.
   ``We condemn this cowardly action in the strongest possible
terms,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The brutality of the drug lords who have taken credit for the
recent wave of killings seems to know no bounds,'' he said.
``Yesterday's killing has to be seen as especially crude and
shocking, coming as it does during Holy Week, which is observed as
a solemn and joyous occasion throughout Colombia and the rest of
Latin America.''

<HEAD>Wisconsin's `Learnfare' Program Meets Resistance; Governor Seeks
Expansion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIE AICHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of a state welfare experiment
that cuts benefits for families whose teen-agers play hooky are
pressuring the government to withdraw its permission for the
program.
   But Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who introduced the Learnfare program
two years ago, wants to expand the program to include elementary
school children.
   He's also considering plans that would refuse to increase
benefits to single mothers who have more children while on welfare
rolls and would allow welfare recipients to work more than 100
hours a month and still receive benefits.
   ``We think Wisconsin deserves it,'' said Thompson, a Republican
who is up for re-election this fall. ``Wisconsin is recognized as a
leader in welfare reform and we'll continue to move forward.''
   While Thompson forges ahead with the experiments, church and
social groups are organizing their opposition to Learnfare, saying
the state is moving too fast with programs that penalize the poor.
   Learnfare cuts Aid to Families with Dependent Children benefits
to families whose teen-agers skip school without an excuse. AFDC
benefits in Wisconsin range from $249 to $983 a month, depending on
family size.
   Learnfare cuts those benefits by $20, to $192 a month, for each
month a family's child or children fail to regularly attend school.
Food stamps and other public assistance are not affected.
   About 2,200 of the estimated 30,000 teen-agers whose families
receive AFDC have been penalized each month. Most are in the
Milwaukee area.
   Supporters such as Thompson argue that education is the first
step to breaking the cycle of welfare dependency and that Learnfare
encourages students to stay in school.
   Opponents point to a recent study conducted by University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee that showed only 28 percent of children whose
families were punished under Learnfare returned to school and
remained there for at least two months.
   An earlier analysis by the state had estimated that about 70
percent of the violators returned to school.
   Carol Croce, executive director of the Wisconsin Nutrition
Program, a Madison-based advocacy group, said Learnfare unfairly
sanctions parents and ``doesn't get at why the kid is missing
school. By taking away that money, you're plunging them further
into poverty.''
   Ms. Croces' group is among nearly 20 church and community
organizations statewide that have jointly asked U.S. Secretary of
Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan to abolish Learnfare on
the grounds that it causes families undue hardship.
   Others joining in include the Milwaukee Catholic Archdiocese,
the Milwaukee Urban League, the NAACP, the League of Women Voters
and the National Association of Social Workers.
   ``We all came to the realization after the release of the
UW-Milwaukee study that all of our worst fears had been justified _
that Learnfare harms families who are in distress,'' said Mike
Soika, a spokesman for the Milwaukee Catholic Archdiocese.
   In Washington, two Wisconsin Democrats, Sen. Herbert H. Kohl and
Rep. Jim Moody, cautioned Sullivan not to grant Thompson permission
to expand the program until more statistics are compiled.
   ``It may be premature to grant a waiver'' for a program that
hasn't proved its effectiveness, said Marcus Kunian, a spokesman
for Moody.
   Thompson's request to expand Learnfare remains ``under
consideration and a final decision has not been made,'' said David
Siegel, spokesman for the Family Support Administration of the U.S.
Department of Health and Social Services.
   On a national level, the American Public Welfare Association, a
Washington-based professional organization for social workers,
considered including a Learnfare model program in proposed 1986
welfare changes but decided against taking a position.
   ``Some felt it was too punitive,'' said Kathy Patterson,
spokeswoman for the association. ``The people we represent are very
much divided on the Learnfare model.''
   Ms. Patterson said many states ``certainly are looking with
interest'' at Learnfare and await more comprehensive studies of it.
   Whether or not Thompson succeeds in expanding Learnfare,
opposition to the program won't stop, Ms. Croce said. ``We'll work
to make the administration accountable,'' she said.

<HEAD>Two Top Government Employees Arrested for Alleged Espionage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARLSRUHE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two senior West German government
employees have been arrested on suspicion of spying for East
Germany, officials said Thursday.
   Rolf Hannich, a spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor's
office in Karlsruhe, said a Foreign Ministry employee was arrested
Tuesday. A high-ranking official of the federal border police was
arrested Wednesday, Hannich said.
   Hannich said both suspects were in investigative custody ``on
suspicion of working as agents for an East European country.'' He
refused to provide any other information, saying it could
jeopardize the investigation.
   Security and diplomatic sources in Bonn, who requested
anonymity, said the Foreign Ministry employee had worked in Paris
for the West German UNESCO mission.
   According to the Hamburg-based Bild newspaper, the Foreign
Ministry employee had been working as an agent since the mid-1970s.
A tip leading to the arrest came from a former officer of the East
German intelligence agency, Bild said.
   The arrests follows reports in Bonn that East German
intelligence agents are still gathering information on high-ranking
West German officials.
   The Bonn-based Die Welt newspaper on Thursday quoted Ottfried
Henning, a state secretary in the Ministry for Inner-German
relations, as saying officials' telephone calls are still being
tapped by East German security agents.
   On April 5, the federal prosecutor's office announced the arrest
of a 45-year-old man working for the West German NATO mission in
Brussels.
   The Hamburg-based Spiegel magazine on Thursday identified the
man as Heinz-Helmuth Werner, a former West German soldier. It said
he had been paid by East German intelligence since 1969 to work as
an agent.
   In a telex report to other news media in advance of its
publication Saturday, Spiegel said Werner had access to highly
classified material in the West German Foreign Ministry. It said he
had worked there since 1974.
   The report said Werner was moved to the ministry's NATO mission
in 1987, where he continued to work as a cipher clerk.
   According to the report, Werner delivered more classified
information to the East Germans and the Soviet KGB than East German
spy Guenther Guillaume.
   Guillaume was a top aide to then-Chancellor Willy Brandt. Brandt
resigned in 1974 after Guillaume was unmasked as an East German spy.
   Guillaume was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 1975, and six
years later traded in a spy swap to East Germany.

   NASA said today it will try again to
launch the shuttle Discovery with the Hubble Space Telescope on
April 25, 15 days after the first attempt.
   The space agency said the date is based on the decision to
remove and replace a malfunctioning power unit on the shuttle and
to recharge the telescope's batteries.
   Discovery's launch was postponed four minutes before liftoff
Tuesday when one of the shuttle's three auxiliary power units
failed.
   Technicians on Wednesday removed the unit's 15-pound controller,
which controls its speed, for shipment back to the manufacturer for
testing. The manufacturer informed NASA the controller was fine,
indicating an unknown problem elsewhere in the unit.
   The unit will be replaced with a new one that will be delivered
to Kennedy Space Center this week, National Aeronautics and Space
Administration officials said. Shuttle managers expect removal and
replacement to take two to three days.
   The shuttle's three APUs pressurize the hydraulic system, which
is used to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the ship's braking
and steering systems.
   NASA planned to open Discovery's sterile payload bay later
today, space agency spokesman Bruce Buckingham said. The
telescope's nickel-hydrogen batterires will be removed and
recharged in a laboratory at Kennedy Space Center.
   ``This allows the batteries to be serviced under the most
favorable conditions while HST remains in the clean environment of
the cargo bay,'' NASA said in a statement early this afternoon.
   Technicians set up traps in a payload preparation room of the
launch pad tower to catch any midges, mosquito-like insects, that
might have been trapped there when the tower was rolled back into
place. Several-dozen midges were spotted in the preparation room
two weeks ago, delaying the telescope's installation in the orbiter
for two days.
   No midges were caught, however, and the traps were removed
today, said NASA spokesman George Diller.
   Insects or any other kind of debris easily could damage the
Hubble's 94-inch mirror, the finest ever made. The $1.5 billion
telescope is NASA's most valuable and complex payload.

<HEAD>School Superintendent Agrees to Remove Tanning Chair From Her
Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUNENBURG, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The school superintendent has removed
her personal tanning chair from her office after protests that it
was in poor taste, giving an appearance of luxury while the school
and town face severe budget problems.
   The chair, with an ultraviolet lamp attached, also took up space
that had been used by a town agency.
   Superintendent Concetta Verge said she had the equipment at
school because her husband would not allow her to use it at home.
She said he considered it harmful to her health. Ultraviolet light
has been linked to skin cancer.
   ``It's gone. It's been removed,'' she said Wednesday.
   ``This is silly'' she said of the furor raised over the tanning
equipment.
   ``People who have talked to me aren't too happy,'' said Joseph
Bilotta, chairman of the selectmen. ``Things are tight and people
take offense.''
   Marcella Collier, a member of the School Committee, said the
tanning equipment did not enhance the superintendent's image in the
conservative north-central Massachusetts town.
   ``I requested to go see it and make sure it was going to be
removed,'' she said.
   ``I'm totally outraged,'' said resident Mary Alatalo. ``It's
more than bizarre because the town is squeezing every department
for everything they've got.''
   Massachusetts has a $2.3 billion budget deficit and has had to
sharply cut aid to local governments, forcing schools to make deep
cuts. At one point, Lunenberg had to close its town library.
   Mrs. Verge said she had been keeping the equipment temporarily
in the school until it could be moved to a relative's home.
   The chair was in a hallway alcove adjoining her office and was
walled off on three sides by doors that were propped up against it.
   The space had housed a desk, file cabinet and telephone
belonging to the town Conservation Commission. But last fall, Mrs.
Verge said the School Department needed the space and the
commission had to truck its gear across town to a Parks Department
garage.

   Soul singer James Brown was moved today to
a work-release center after serving 15 months of a six-year prison
sentence for aggravated assault, a corrections official said.
   Brown will work for the Aiken-Barnwell County Community Action
Commission, making speeches to young people about not using illegal
drugs and alcohol, said Francis X. Archibald, a spokesman for the
state Department of Corrections.
   The 56-year-old Brown left the State Park Correctional Center in
Columbia about 12:30 p.m. and arrived at the Lower Savannah Work
Center near Aiken a little over an hour later, Archibald said.
   Brown, nicknamed the Godfather of Soul, will undergo orientation
and probably will not start work until Monday, the spokesman said.
   The singer is only allowed out of the minimum-security facility
to go to work. He must return to the facility, which has a small
fence and unarmed guards, at night and on weekends.
   After two to three months in the work-release program, Brown can
apply for extended work-release, which would allow him to live at
an approved place away from the center, possibly his home in nearby
Beech Island, Archibald said.
   Brown is serving a concurrent six-year sentence in Georgia and
South Carolina for failing to stop for police, aggravated assault
and weapons violations stemming from a chase in September 1988. He
began serving his prison term on Dec. 29, 1988.
   Brown becomes eligible for parole in South Carolina in May 1991
but will not be eligible for parole under the Georgia sentence
until March 1992.
   Archibald said the Aiken-Barnwell County Community Action
Commission must pay Brown at least the minimum wage, but his
paychecks will be turned over to the corrections department.
Inmates are not allowed to have more than $50 at one time.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he is determined to sign
the framework for an accord to limit long-range nuclear arms at a
May summit in Washington, Senate Majority leader George Mitchell
reported Friday.
   Mitchell spoke to reporters after he and six other U.S. senators
met with the Soviet president at his office earlier in the day at
the Kremlin.
   The Senate leader said Gorbachev ``stressed his determination''
to make enough progress on a treaty cutting long-range nuclear
weapons to allow it to be initialed at the May 30 superpower summit.
   After a visit in Washington last week by Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, both sides virtually ruled out signing a
formal treaty at the summit. The goal then became to initial the
framework for an agreement.
   Asked by the U.S. senators about the Kremlin's month-old
confrontation with Lithuania, Gorbachev ``stated his intention to
resolve the matter by peaceful, non-violent means,'' said Mitchell.
Gorbachev has previously said he does not want to use force against
the Lithuanians, who declared independence March 11.
   Mitchell, of Maine, said he restated to Gorbachev the U.S.
government's position that if the Kremlin resorts to force to bring
the Baltic republic back into line, it would bring ``grave
consequences'' for Soviet-U.S. relations.
   Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey said Gorbachev also mentioned
the ban on foreign press in Lithuania and argued that ``from time
to time, such actions have to be taken.''
   Asked if he was satisfied with the justification for expelling
hundreds of reporters last month, Bradley said, ``I, personally,
was not.''
   Mitchell said the delegation met with Lithuanian lawmakers while
in Leningrad but did not plan to visit the republic itself.
   Mitchell also said Gorbachev, in the talk with the seven
Democrats that lasted more than two hours, discussed Soviet
economic reform. Mitchell said the Soviet leader called the current
transition period between a planned and a market economy ``the most
crucial stage of perestroika.''
   Gorbachev is scheduled to meet with his top advisers Saturday to
decide on the radical reform he has promised since taking office as
president last month. The basic outline of the reform _ with
changes in pricing, the banking system, taxation and ownership laws
_ has been made public, but few details have been announced.
   The senators also met with Shevardnadze on Thursday afternoon.
The delegation consisted of Mitchell, Bradley, Sens. John Glenn of
Ohio, James Sasser of Tennessee, Wyche Fowler of Georgia, Paul
Sarbanes of Maryland and Tom Daschle of South Dakota.

<TEXT>
   Black U.S. Capitol police officers, who have
complained of racial discrimination in hiring and on the job, asked
Thursday for help from the Congressional Black Caucus.
   ``We are black police officers and expected the Congressional
Black Caucus to be the first in line to support our cause,'' said
Sgt. Ronald L. Richardson, executive director of the Capitol Police
chapter of the National Black Police Association.
   ``It has become crystal clear that even after following all the
rules and going through all the proper channels, no one on Capitol
Hill is serious about our plight,'' Richardson told a news
conference.
   Black officers say top commanders, all of whom are white, have
discriminated in promotion and training practices and engaged in
racial harrassment. There are 1,238 officers, including 336 blacks.
   Among the top ranks of lieutenant, captain, inspector, deputy
chief, assistant chief and chief, however, there are 61 whites and
four blacks. The top-ranking black officer is a captain.
   Responding to the allegations, Capitol police spokesman Dan
Nichols said that it ``has been our position that we do not want to
mediate these issues through the press.''
   ``We have asked and are awaiting them to come forth with
substantive issues,'' Nichols said.
   Most lawmakers were away from Capitol Hill for a holiday recess
and plan to return next week. But Congressional Black Caucus
spokeswoman Amelia Parker described the group as ``very concerned''
about the allegations.
   ``The issue was brought before the caucus immediately before the
recess period,'' she said. ``Upon their return the members will
continue to pursue resolution of this matter and investigation into
charges iof harassment.''
   On March 22, black officers told a House subcommittee that
cronyism and nepotism exists in employment practices of the Capitol
force.
   Witnesses said department rules say police must be given study
materials six months before exams but some minority officers do not
receive their copies until two months before taking the tests.
   Black officers complained of being victims of harassment, racial
jokes and threats. One said he found a note on his locker saying
that the Ku Klux Klan was watching him.
   A 14-year veteran of the force said she was placed under
investigation for misuse of her lunch hour shortly after appearing
as a witness at a congressional hearing. She said her superiors did
not explain the charge.
   Police Chief Frank A. Kerrigan told the subcommittee hearing
that he was unaware of those examples or of any discrimination. He
asked the officers to provide him with specifics.

   A California Highway Patrol officer
responding to a traffic accident discovered that his 16-year-old
son had been killed in the crash, authorities said.
   Timothy Brown was pronounced dead at the scene, said Santa
Barbara County Coroner's Detective John Hupp.
   Brown was killed Tuesday when the truck he was riding in veered
off a curve, plowed into some trees and overturned in a creekbed
outside Solvang, said Highway Patrol spokesman Kevin Dougherty.
   His father, Officer T.Y. Brown, responded to the accident call.
   When he arrived, ``he found out it was his son and was
immediately relieved of duty,'' Dougherty said.
   The 17-year-old driver was listed in fair condition at Cottage
Hospital in Santa Barbara. He was arrested for investigation of
vehicular manslaughter and driving under the influence, a Highway
Patrol spokeswoman said.
   Solvang is northwest of Santa Barbara.

<HEAD>NOW Targets Oregon, Nevada For Next Abortion Fights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Organization for Women is
stepping up its fund-raising efforts for campaigns over ballot
initiatives in Oregon and Nevada, states NOW officials on Thursday
called the newest battlegrounds over abortion.
   ``We do not intend to lose Oregon,'' said NOW President Molly
Yard, promising a strong fight against two proposed ballot
questions that would limit abortion in the traditionally liberal
state.
   ``What they are deciding is going to affect every woman in this
country,'' she said. ``It is not a state issue. It is a national
issue.''
   She said the group is holding rallies in Oregon to fight the
proposed initiatives and in Nevada to support a pro-choice
referendum there.
   The emotional abortion debate has focused on the states since a
Supreme Court ruling in a Missouri case last year gave state
legislators greater power to regulate abortion. Since then, both
sides have fought over moves by state lawmakers and ballot
questions to change local laws.
   This week, New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg, a Republican, vetoed a
bill he said would have been the most liberal abortion law in the
country.
   Anti-abortion activists in Oregon are gathering signatures to
place two questions on the ballot this fall that would put new
limits on abortion in that state.
   ``They believe if they can win in one of the most progressive
states in the nation, they will have an impact across the
country,'' said Sheri O'Dell, a NOW vice president.
   Yard said that abortion rights activists hope to head off
possible action by Nevada's legislature, which does not meet this
year but is considered strongly anti-abortion. ``The plan is to
pass a law through initiative this year so the legislature can't
touch the question,'' she said.
   Yard told a press conference that NOW will use rallies in both
states to step up its efforts to raise money and recruit new
pro-choice activists.
   ``We know we are up against a very well-financed right wing in
this country,'' she said. ``They pass the collection plate at
evangelical churches. They pass the collection plate at Roman
Catholic churches. It is a very quick source of money.''
   A spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee said
Thursday officials were not immediately available for comment about
NOW's new plans.
   O'Dell said NOW officials hope to spend $500,000 to stop the
anti-abortion ballot measures in Oregon and $300,000 to pass the
pro-choice initiative in Nevada.
   Yard said the abortion debate is also causing more women to run
for office.
   She said 91 women in Pennsylvania have announed plans to run for
the state legislature there, partly in response to anti-abortion
legislation in the state. Seventee of Pennsylvania's 253 lawmakers
are women.

   Maoist guerrillas attacked a base built by the
U.S. government as a staging ground for anti-drug operations,
sparking a battle involving American civilians and Peruvian police,
U.S. officials said Thursday.
   No Americans or Peruvian police were killed or wounded in the
hour-long battle Saturday. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said base
personnel found no rebel bodies but that police believed several
dead rebels may have been carried off after the pre-dawn battle.
   He said between 40 and 60 guerrillas attacked the base with
small arms and grenade launchers.
   It was the first attack on the new $3 million base in Santa
Lucia, 265 northeast of Lima. The base is a staging ground for
anti-drug operations in Peru's coca-rich Upper Huallaga valley.
   The valley is a stronghold of the Maoist Shining Path rebels.
Drug smugglers pay the rebels to operate in the area.
   The guerrillas say they are defending the interests of peasant
coca farmers from abuses by drug traffickers and the police.
   The spokesman, who asked that his name not be used for security
reasons, said U.S. anti-drug personnel working in the area have
been fired on in the past, although this was the biggest attack to
date.
   Peruvian police sources said U.S. helicopters were called in to
repel a December guerrilla attack against a police post in Nuevo
Progresso, a town about six miles from the base. Embassy officials
denied the report at the time.
   An American pilot was wounded in the leg when his helicopter was
fired on during an operation in February 1989. That prompted the
withdrawal of U.S. personnel from the valley until the fortified
Santa Lucia base was finished in September.
   U.S. law prohibits American personnel or equipment from being
used against guerrillas except when they are attacked during
anti-drug operations.
   About 30 Americans have worked out of the base since September.
They include federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents and
civilian helicopter pilots and mechanics working for a private
company under contract to the U.S. State Department.
   Normally about 500 people are stationed there, including
Peruvian police rangers and civilian eradication workers. But the
embassy spokesman said only about 120 people were there Saturday
because many of the civilians had left to vote in Sunday's
presidential elections.
   He said police were tipped off to a possible attack Friday night
by people abandoning their homes in the small village of Santa
Lucia, just outside the base.
   Police were dispatched to patrol the area and spotted the rebel
column late Friday night.
   He said the guerrillas opened fired from across the Huallaga
River, which borders the base, but were too far away to be
effective. The river is about 100 yards across at that point.
   The base personnel responded with small arms fire, and two
helicopters piloted by Americans using night-vision goggles took
off and attacked the rebel positions, he said. Peruvian police
manned the M-60 machine guns aboard the helicopters.
   Ten UH-1H Huey helicopters belonging to the U.S. State
Department are on loan to the Peruvian police for use in anti-drug
operations.
   The Shining Path launched its armed insurgency against Peru's
elected government in 1980 in the southern Andean highlands.

   Giant African frogs with teeth,
foot-long legs and prodigious jumping ability have arrived to get a
toehold in the 62nd annual Jumping Frog Jubilee at the Calaveras
County fairgrounds.
   Animal importer Andy Koffman of Seattle applied Wednesday to
enter the behemoths in the May 17-20 competition inspired by Mark
Twain's short story, ``The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras
County.''
   ``You want me to predict? OK, they'll break the world record,''
said Koffman.
   He plans to bring 20 frogs to Angels Camp, ranging from 2 to
about 9 pounds. Twelve are too big for the competition and would
make exhibition jumps only, he said.
   Eight others are small enough to place all four feet on the
jubilee's official 9-inch-diameter launch pad and to compete with
domestic 1-pound frogs.
   The current record is held by a 1-pound frog, Rosie the Ribiter,
which jumped more than 21 feet in 1985. Under contest rules, frogs
must have all four feet on the 9-inch pad, and jump without being
touched by their owners, who can shout and pound the stage.
   The distance is measured as the total of three successive hops.
   On Wednesday, one of Koffman's 4-pound African frog's covered 19
feet in two hops.
   But he said he once saw one in Africa jump a 20-foot river.

   It took nine years for 75-year-old Benjamin
Blakeman IV and his wife, Mary Lou, to have one baby _ then another
and another.
   Mrs. Blakeman, 37, delivered triplets, two girls and a boy,
Sunday at Swedish Hospital Medical Center.
   ``These babies are both a blessing and a reward after nine years
of trying,'' she said. ``We'd like to encourage people who are
trying and to tell them to stick with it.''
   The pregnancy was assisted by the Reproductive Genetics Group of
Swedish Hospital Medical Center. More than 150 babies have been
born with the group since it began offering assisted reproductive
techniques, such as in vitro fertilization, in 1984.

   Forget about egg rolling contests and
colorfully dyed Easter eggs. The real egg-citement this weekend is
the expected hatching of a California condor chick.
   Four chicks have hatched this year, the latest on Tuesday,
bringing the total population of the endangered species up to only
36.
   San Diego Wild Animal Park officials are anticipating another
hatching, on Easter Sunday, said park spokesman Tom Hanscom.
   ``The chick has broken through the air cell to the top end of
the egg, and that's the first step in the hatching process.
Sometime in the next couple of days, the chick will make a hole in
the shell and we will begin a three-day countdown to hatching,'' he
said.
   More hatchings are expected this year at the San Diego park and
the Los Angeles Zoo, where all the condors are in captivity in an
effort to breed them to greater numbers.
   ``We are still incubating six eggs between (the Wild Animal
Park) and L.A. Zoo, including one that was just laid on April 7,''
said Hanscom. ``Five certainly are fertile and one is unknown at
this time.''

   Motorists fuming over noxious tailpipe
emissions on Southern California roads are becoming smog snitches
in record numbers, officials said.
   Calls last month to the smog snitch hotline at the South Coast
Air Quality Management District in El Monte jumped 152 percent over
March 1989 totals, spokesman Tom Eichhorn said Wednesday.
   Air quality officials attribute the success partly to a $100,000
billboard advertising campaign, which shows a car belching dense
black smoke beneath the words ``Report This Crime: 1-800 CUT SMOG.''
   ``It has been a dynamite ad campaign for us,'' Eichhorn said.
   The regional smog control agency placed 125 billboard ads
throughout its jurisdiction in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino
and Riverside counties.
   ``You drive all the time in your car and you're always following
all these obnoxious cars and trucks,'' said one tipster, Kathleen
Felde of Los Angeles. `` ... It's a great way to get even, I'll
just put it that way.''
   The program's success reflects how tips from cellular car phones
have become a way of life on Southern California freeways.
   Dona Dower, traffic reporter for KNX-AM radio in Los Angeles,
says she typically gets 75 to 100 calls a day about traffic
conditions from commuters with cellular car phones.
   Regular callers often adopt pseudonyms such as ``Mr. Smog Man''
or ``Mr. Ed,'' and report as many as 30 tailpipe polluters a month,
said Bruce Collins, manager of the district's smoking vehicle
program.
   Last month, smog hotline operators received a record 17,671
calls, compared with 7,000 received in the previous March.
   About 150,000 complaints have been received since the hotline
was established in June 1988, Collins added.
   After receiving a license plate number phoned in by a tipster,
the district tracks down the vehicle's registered owner and mails a
warning that driving an excessively smoking motor vehicle is a
violation.
   ``Local law enforcement agencies and the California Highway
Patrol will cite drivers of such vehicles and you may be subject to
a fine of $100,'' the letter says.
   Compliance is voluntary, and Eichhorn estimated that about 20
percent of the people contacted reply that they've fixed the
problem.
   Eichhorn said he's familiar with complaints that the smog snitch
program is just another example of the ``Big Brother'' mentality in
the agency.
   ``Our response is that this a voluntary program,'' Eichhorn
said. ``There is no ticket. There is no cop knocking on the door.
This is just a letter, a friendly letter _ well, a sort of friendly
letter _ telling them that their car is a problem and they could
get a ticket.''
   The California Highway Patrol reports that the number of
citations it has handed out also has increased, mostly because of
the addition of eight officers who work exclusively on issuing
tailpipe citations.
   Citations issued from January to March 1990 reached 3,170 _ a 25
percent increase over the same three-month period a year ago, said
Sgt. Mike Brey, a highway patrol spokesman.

   The world's second-oldest ruling
Communist Party dropped the word ``communism'' from its
constitution Thursday and set a new goal of building ``democratic
humane socialism.''
   An extraordinary congress of the Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party adopted a new party constitution and platform
to reflect its recent acceptance of democratic reforms and
opposition parties.
   A proposal to change the party's name, dropping the word
``revolutionary,'' was defeated.
   The party, which is trying to change its image to keep power in
free elections, appeared to be suffering from an identity crisis.
   ``Our party remains Marxist-Leninist,'' party ideology chief
Tsahilgaan said. But he said that ``Marxism-Leninism or any other
theories are not dogmas,'' and that the party no longer used the
word ``communism.''
   ``We now have realized that communism is a thing far away from
us,'' he said. ``We are for building a humane, democratic
socialism.''
   Asked if the party should be called communist or socialist, he
said: ``Let's leave it to you.''
   Tsahilgaan said the new party constitution cuts the number of
party employees, gives more financial and decision-making power to
local party bodies, and guarantees their right to criticize the
center.
   But one party intellectual, speaking on condition of anonymity,
noted that the party is keeping its cells in ministries, factories
and other work units.
   ``Nothing can change,'' he said. ``Someone still can say, `You
are a party member. Do this.'''
   The congress' 926 delegates continued meeting late into the
night to elect a new Central Committee. It will in turn select a
new top leadership body, to be renamed the Presidium instead of the
current Politburo.
   It was unclear if the new Presidium would consist of the same
five men who make up the Politburo. They were appointed less than a
month ago after an opposition hunger strike forced out the old
party leadership.
   The Communists have ruled this Soviet-allied pastoral nation
with an iron grip since 1921, when the Soviets helped Mongolia gain
independence from China.
   Following the Soviet example, party leaders began talking about
reform several years ago. Real changes have come only in the past
few months, since young intellectuals began demonstrating. They
said they were inspired by Soviet glasnost and the fall of
Communist parties in Eastern Europe.
   ``We do not have great hope that (the ruling party) will be able
to renew itself,'' said Batsukh, chairman of the New Progressive
Party, which wants rapid privatization of the economy.
   The New Progressives said Thursday they had agreed to cooperate
with two other opposition parties, the Mongolian Democratic Party
and the Social Democrats, in fielding canddates for legislative
elections tentatively planned for July.
   Some observers were skeptical that the parties, which want
reform at different paces, would be able to cooperate. Already,
divisions have appeared within individual parties. For example,
half the leadership of the Mongolian Democratic Party dismissed the
other half earlier this week in a power struggle.

<TEXT>
   Three clerical workers at the nation's
second-largest public employee union charged in a federal suit
Thursday that the union had discriminated against blacks in its
hiring and promotion decisions.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, alleged that the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees had
violated federal civil rights laws by engaging in ``deliberate and
systematic'' employment practices that discriminate against blacks.
   ``AFSCME's employment practices are sound and within the law,''
said Bob Harman, a spokesman for the 1.25-million member union. He
declined further comment until lawyers had reviewed the case. About
17 percent of the union's rank-and-file members are black, the
union said.
   The suit comes at a time when the American labor movement,
facing declining membership in recent years, is trying to court
blacks and women to rebuild strength.
   The suit charged that AFSCME, ``through the acts and omissions
of its overwhelmingly white supervisory work force,'' discriminated
against blacks in decisions involving hiring, assignments,
promotion, compensation and discipline.
   Furthermore, the suit alleged, white supervisors harassed and
disciplined blacks who complained about discriminatory practices.
   The suit said that in 1988 blacks made up about 32 percent of
the work force at the union's Washington headquarters, but that
there were no black department heads. Last year, only one of 14
department heads was black, it said.
   Blacks are confined to lower-level jobs in the organization, the
suit also contends. While blacks had only 15 percent of the jobs
paying more than $50,000 a year in 1989, they held 47 percent of
the positions in the union's four lowest pay grades, the suit said.
   The three black workers who filed the suit are Mary Craft and
Mary Maynard, office assistants at the union's Washington
headquarters, and Jean Brown, a secretary in the union's Baltimore
field office. The three women, all Maryland residents, represent
former, current and future black job applicants and employees
dating back to February 1984.
   The suit seeks back pay, promotions and reclassifications for
those blacks and compensatory and punitive damages in amounts to be
determined at trial.
   The National Education Association is the only public employee
union with more members than AFSCME.

   Arch A. Moore Jr., three time governor
of West Virginia, pleaded guilty to extortion, mail fraud, tax
fraud and obstruction of justice charges, a federal prosecutor said
today.
   Moore faces up to 36 years in prison and fines of up to $1.2
million, U.S. Attorney Michael Carey told reporters.
   It was the second time Moore was indicted for alleged
improprieties in office.
   The indictment accused Moore of committing illegal acts relating
to his 1984 campaign, his third term as governor from 1985 to 1989,
and his unsuccessful 1988 campaign.
   Moore, a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, also
is accused of blocking a federal grand jury's investigation of him
last year and this year, Carey said.
   The indictment further alleged Moore used his public position to
extort approximately $573,000 in 1985, Carey said. It also accused
him of filing false income tax returns in 1984 and 1985, the
official said.
   And it charged that he schemed to defraud the state of his
salary and benefits by funneling approximately $100,000 in cash
into his 1984 campaign fund, Carey said.
   Moore and his 1972 campaign manager were indicted in December
1975 on a charge of extorting $25,000 from the president of a shaky
financial holding company trying to get a state charter for a new
bank. He was acquitted in 1976.
   Moore, who will be 67 on Monday, was the first West Virginia
governor elected to two four-year terms and the first elected to
three, serving from 1969 to 1977 and from 1985 to 1989. He lost his
bid for a fourth four-year term as governor in 1988 to Gaston
Caperton.
   The silver-haired Republican patriarch extended his reign over
three decades despite a 2-to-1 registration edge for the Democrats
and almost constant controversy.
   He served one term in the state House of Delegates from 1953 to
1954 and was elected to Congress in 1956. At 33, Moore was the
youngest freshman in the 85th Congress and represented the state's
Northern Panhandle for six terms.
   In 1968, Moore gave up his House seat to run for governor. He
was injured two days before the election when his helicopter
crashed at a political rally in Hamlin. He made a brief statement
to the crowd before being rushed to the hospital and many political
observers credit that event for helping him win.
   In August 1979, his former state liquor commissioner, J. Richard
Barber, was convicted of racketeering, extortion and mail fraud.
The conviction involved charges that Barber received cash and free
liquor from distillers while serving as Moore's commissioner of
alcohol beverage control.
   The trial included testimony that some of the cash was used for
campaign contributions, and some of the liquor was passed on to the
governor's office. Barber was sentenced to three years in prison.
   Moore was the second West Virginia governor to encounter legal
trouble. Former Democratic Gov. W.W. ``Wally'' Barron, who served
from 1961 to 1965, and several of his associates were tried on
bribery conspiracy charges in 1968. Barron was acquitted but later
went to prison for bribing the foreman of the U.S. District Court
jury that acquitted him.

   President Bush is suffering from ``an early
glaucoma'' in his left eye, medical tests disclosed today.
   The glaucoma, which the White House said has not affected his
vision, was discovered during a routine physical at Bethesday Naval
Hospital, the White House said. It will be treated with eye drops.
   In general, Bush ``is in excellent health,'' said White House
physician Dr. Burton Lee in a statement released by the press
office. ``He continues to keep extremely fit through vigorous
physical activities.''
   The glaucoma will be treated with Betagen eye drops, which Bush
will take for the rest of life. The dosage is one drop every 12
hours, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in the statement.
   Although Bush is not suffering impairment of his vision,
glaucoma can lead to blindness if not treated.
   The disease is characterized by increased pressure and hardening
of the eyeball.
   Bush has had a stye in his right eye for the past week, which is
nearly gone after treatments with soaks and antibiotics, Fitzwater
said.
   He said X-rays of Bush's hips and neck showed mild degenerative
osteoarthritis, a condition disclosed in past physical examinations.
   During four hours of tests and examination, he also underwent
chest X-rays, which were normal; an electrocardiogram and stress
tests, which were normal; urinalysis showing no abnormality; blood
tests which were normal; and a dermatology exam, showing ``no
significant problem or change,'' Fitzwater said.
   The only problem cited during last year's physical was a cyst on
the third finger of Bush's right hand. The cyst was surgically
removed last October and later was pronounced benign.
   ``His allergy problems remain minimal and unchanged,'' the
spokesman said.
   The 65-year-old president's last physical was May 10, 1989, and
he was pronounced in good health.
   Bush emerged from the examination telling reporters he felt
``like a spring colt.''
   He told reporters ``all is well'' on his return to the White
House.
   Bush left the medical center in suburban Maryland for his
helicopter flight back wearing sunglasses and flashing a double
thumbs-up sign.
   Bush left the White House after 7 a.m. for the short helicopter
ride to the suburban hospital. He was accompanied by Lee, who
oversaw the examination.

   Customs officers seized a huge forged steel tube
ordered by Iraq after military experts determined Thursday that it
could be used to build a gun capable of hurling nuclear or chemical
warheads hundreds of miles.
   Iraq denied the accusation, and the British manufacturer said
the tube would blow up if anyone tried to use it as a gun barrel.
   Arms experts say a gun with a barrel the size of the tube seized
by Customs _ 131 feet long with a 39-inch bore _ could fire
artillery shells as far as Tehran or Tel Aviv, each within 350
miles of Iraq's borders. Such a weapon would be the longest gun
ever made.
   ``There is no question it could be used as a barrel of a large
artillery gun to fire a projectile of some considerable size. It is
definitely subject to export licensing controls,'' said Douglas
Tweddle, head of the Customs and Excise Office.
   On March 28, customs officials seized U.S.-made parts for atomic
bomb triggers that were bound for Iraq. Iraq has confirmed it has
chemical weapons but denied seeking a nuclear capability.
   Last week, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatened to use
missiles armed with chemical warheads against Israel if Israel
attacked his country.
   The seizure of the triggers and Iraq's execution March 15 of a
British-based reporter convicted of spying have soured
British-Iraqi relations.
   ``Even if we bought a box of chocolates from Britain, they would
say Iraq will use it to produce an atom bomb,'' Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters in Mosul, Iraq.
   ``Everything that is said about these pipes is baseless,'' said
Naiel Hassan, press attache at the Iraqi Embassy in London. ``The
British and the Israelis are trying to make a fuss about this
matter. Even the company itself said that these pipes are used for
only petrochemical industries.''
   The Iraqi government and the reported manufacturer, Sheffield
Forgemasters, had insisted the equipment impounded was a pipe
designed for a petrochemical plant. The company said the
government's Department of Trade and Industry had reviewed and
approved the project.
   Phillip Wright, chief executive of Sheffield Forgemasters, said
the company had been approached by Iraqis about building gun
barrels, but the company refused after consulting the British
government.
   Customs officials are convinced that the impounded tube is
covered by government rules banning the export of certain
munitions, Tweddle said.
   Britain banned all arms sales to Iraq and its enemy Iran
following the outbreak of the eight-year Persian Gulf War. There
has been a cease-fire since 1988, but Iran and Iraq are still not
officially at peace and the British embargo remains.
   ``The goods are now seized. Investigations will continue to
prove intent and to establish whether offenses have been
committed,'' Tweddle said.
   The equipment, impounded at the northeastern English port of
Middlesbrough Tuesday night, was packed in eight crates and was
being loaded aboard a ship chartered by the Iraqi Maritime
Organization, Customs officials said.
   Wright said the tube seized by Customs could not be used as a
gun.
   ``If they did manage to get all the other necessary components I
wouldn't stand within a mile of the thing if they tried to fire it.
It would blow itself to pieces,'' the Sheffield Star newspaper
quoted Wright as saying.
   Wright said Iraqi officials had approached his company about
making gun barrels, but it declined.
   ``What we made were a series of tubes and they are not like any
sort of a gun,'' he said. ``We do make gun barrels and in fact they
are immediately recognizable.''
   Sheffield Forgemasters confirmed that Customs officers seized
company documents Wednesday.
   A spokesman for Walter Somers Ltd. in Halesowen, near
Birmingham, said Customs officers also seized documents there. The
spokesman, who spoke anonymously, said the company produced some
steel piping ``of very much smaller dimensions'' for Iraq in 1988
and had no pending orders from the country.
   Two weeks ago, Customs officers seized 40 American-made
components for nuclear bomb triggers as they were being put aboard
an Iraqi Airways flight to Baghdad from London. Five people were
arrested; three are facing charges, one was deported and one was
released.
   Iraq is widely believed to be building a nuclear bomb, and there
has been increasing concern about its weapons program.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the United States was asking the British government for information
about the impounding action and would have no comment for the time
being.
   British news reports speculated that an Iraqi gun project could
be linked to Gerald Bull, an American ballistics expert who was
killed in Brussels on March 22. Bull, 62, a Canadian-born American
citizen, was found shot to death with $20,000 in his pockets,

   Lose one space race and some Soviets just
won't let you forget it. At least it may have seemed that way to
Sen. John Glenn on Thursday as a visit to the Kremlin happened to
coincide with the Soviet Union's ``Cosmonaut Day.''
   On April 12, 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first person to orbit
the Earth. Ten months later _ after another successful orbiting by
the Soviets _ Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth.
   The Ohio Democrat was in a seven-senator delegation that met
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Kremlin on Thursday.
They also met with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and
other officials.
   In a telephone conversation with reporters in Washington, Glenn
said references to the space race and Cosmonaut Day dogged him
throughout the day.
   ``It was brought up every place today,'' Glenn said in Moscow.
``I assured everyone today that I remember the day very, very well
because I was in training as an astronaut at that time and we had
hoped to be the very first into space with out program.
   ``It came as a shock to us when the Soviet Union went ahead of
us,'' he said.

   At what they billed as their largest
congress ever, Gypsies from 27 countries demanded respect for their
culture and an end to the stereotypes that have long seen them
scorned as thieving fortunetellers.
   The weeklong meeting of some 300 delegates ended Wednesday with
the appeals from the worldwide wanderers that they be treated as
any other disadvantaged minority.
   Delegates to the fourth Congress of the World of Romany Union
discussed issues including standardizing their Roma language,
discrimination, memorializing Gypsy victims of the NaziHolocaust
and the potential dangers for Gypsies posed by rising nationalism
in Eastern Europe.
   Sessions were held at a steel mill's country recreation center
24 miles north of Warsaw. After somber speeches during the day, the
delegates gathered for singing and dancing in unbridled celebration
of their heritage.
   The conference was conducted in the Gypsy Roma language, but
with 20 major dialects worldwide delegates sometimes had difficulty
making themselves understood to all participants.
   Gypsies, or the Romany as they prefer to be known, are descended
from nomadic tribes that left northwestern India sometime during
the first millenium and made their first recorded appearance in
Western Europe early in the 1400s.
   Their worldwide population is variously estimated at 5 million
to more than 10 million.
   The Romany have been associated in popular lore with
fortunetelling, stealing and music-making, and conference
participants said the stereotypes had been forced upon them by
``gaje,'' or non-Gypsies.
   ``Nobody takes us seriously,'' said Ian Hancock, a British-born
Gypsy who teaches linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin.
   ``We are one people who arrived in Europe 800 years ago who have
become fragmented by the hostility we encountered from Europeans.
But now we must work toward becoming one people again,'' he said.
   The meeting elected poet Rajko Djuric of Yugoslavia as president
of the World Romany Union.
   The union ``calls on all governments to treat Gypsies as human
beings,'' Djuric said. ``We call for giving them the right to life
and their own culture and language.''
   The first world meeting was held in 1971 in London, but this was
the first that delegates from the Soviet Union and Albania were
able to attend.
   ``Thanks to perestroika and democratization, we are here,'' said
Lev Cerenkov of Moscow, who came with 15 other Soviet citizens.
   In the Soviet Union and most Warsaw Pact countries, Gypsies were
forced by Communist governments to give up their nomadic lifestyles
after World War II.
   Their horses were shot or taken away and the wheels removed from
their painted wagons. Some still live in dilapidated barracks given
to them at that time, said Stanislaw Stankiewicz of Poland.
   Europe's Gypsy population was devastated during the Holocaust,
when 500,000 to 1 million were put to death in gas chambers.
   The genocide was only the culmination of the persecution for the
Gypsies, Hancock said. Many countries banned Gypsies and some
permitted them to be used as slaves or hunted.
   ``The romantic interpretation of the wandering gypsy is not
romantic at all,'' Hancock said. ``It is really life on the run.''
   Today, Gypsies suffer from lower education levels, income and
life expectancy than their non-gypsy neighbors, and often have
trouble obtaining basic services or recognition, Hancock said.
   If Gypsies steal, it is often ``subsistence theft'' to feed
their families when discrimination prevents them from obtaining
honest work, he said.
   ``We are third-class citizens,'' said Rudko Kawczinski, a former
member of the European Parliament from Hamburg, West Germany.
   ``The political changes in Eastern Europe, which the West sees
as very positively, is starting to look bad for Gypsies. There is a
backlash of prejudice against minorities,'' Hancock said.
   There were many signs at the meeting of Gypsy pride, however.
   Many delegates sported Gypsy flag lapel pins, which are blue and
green with a spoked wheel in the center. The ``wheel of fire'' is
from Indian mythology and represents the Gypsies' origins in India,
Hancock said.
   Some delegates said the Romany must become more involved in
politics at home.
   ``What is important is getting people to notice us on this globe
and understanding out culture and traditions,'' said Stankiewicz,
of Bialystok, who recently founded Poland's first Roma-language
newspaper.

<HEAD>Congress Approves President's Economic Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN SILVERSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil's Congress gave a major
victory to President Fernando Collor de Mello by passing intact the
heart of his draconian anti-inflation plan. Economists said a
severe recession is a certainty.
   In a surprising vote late Wednesday, legislators passed by
249-204 a measure that froze for 18 months all bank deposits of
more than $1,200 and money market deposits of more than $600.
   ``I am extremely satisfied with the result of the congressional
session,'' Collor told reporters as he headed for a pizzeria in
Brasilia to celebrate.
   Collor decreed the measure as part of a series of reforms
launched Mar. 16, the day after he took office. He said it was
central to his strategy of beating 4,854 percent annual inflation.
   Economic Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello was exultant after the
vote and said the legislators' action would ensure the success of
the ``New Brazil Plan.''
   But economists agreed that Collor's plan will produce a brutal
recession, at least in the short term.
   ``A recession is inevitable _ its duration will depend on the
government's future conduct of economic policy. But I would not be
surprised to see a 20 percent drop in industrial production over
the next three months,'' said Edmar Bacha, an economist.
   Bacha, who supports the plan, said an economic downturn was
necessary to end chronic inflation.
   Signs of an impending recession are everywhere. The automobile,
capital goods, construction and machine tools industries are
virtually paralyzed. Unions say almost 1 million workers have
either been fired, taken pay cuts, or been put on collective
holiday.
   ``The government will have to create special credit lines for
badly hit sectors to prevent the recession from getting out of of
control,'' said Mario Henrique Simonsen, a conservative economist
who served as finance minister between 1974 and 1979, when Brazil
was run by a right-wing military regime.
   Simonsen said the depth of the recession would depend on the
public's confidence in the plan.
   ``The bank confiscation has shaken the short-term confidence of
investors and savers in the financial system. How they react in the
longer term will be crucial,'' he said.
   Leftist economists were especially critical.
   ``We are going to have a deep and long depression. You can't
solve economic problems with this sort of drastic solution,'' said
Paul Singer, a leading economist with the socialist Workers Party.
   He said the Workers Party favored collective bargaining of wages
and prices between labor unions and business to bring down
inflation, without producing a recession.
   ``I am afraid of very serious social convulsions. This downturn
will be far worse than the 1983 recession,'' he said. During that
recession, the economy fell by 3 percent, resulting in widescale
looting of supermarkets and an increase in urban violence.
   ``The logic of the plan is to paralyze the economy for several
months and then make the recession tolerable. But the shock was so
strong I'm not sure how long it will be before we reach the
tolerable stage,'' said Rep. Cesar Maia, an economist and spokesman
for the center-left Democratic Labor Party.
   Maia criticized the government for not increasing unemployment
benefits and taking other measures to cushion the blow for those
who are directly hit by the recession. But he said if the
government managed the plan well, the economy could begin to grow
again in about a year.
   Simonsen said the long-term success of the plan depends on what
happens when the government begins returning the money in frozen
bank accounts.

<TEXT>
   Playwright August Wilson on Thursday captured
his second Pulitzer Prize for drama in four years when he was
honored with the 1990 award for ``The Piano Lesson.''
   Oscar Hijuelos' book, ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,''
won the 1990 Pulitzer for fiction. Hijuelos' novel detailed the
lives of three brothers from Havana who become minor celebrities as
musicians in New York nightclubs.
   ``I had no idea it was even being announced this week,''
Hijuelos, a Manhattan resident, said in a telephone interview from
a friend's house in Ulster County.
   ``I wasn't sitting around chewing on my nails. I came up here to
really cool out. Now, I may have to turn around and drive back into
the city. But worse things can happen.''
   It was only the second novel written by Hijuelos. Pultizer
Administrator Robert Christopher said he believed Hijuelos was the
first Hispanic winner of the Pulitzer for fiction.
   Stanley Karnow's book, ``In Our Image: America's Empire in the
Philippines,'' won for history. Karnow is a long-time foreign
correspondent for several news organizations. He also wrote
``Vietnam: A History,'' which later won six Emmy Awards in its
television incarnation.
   The Pulitzer for general non-fiction went to ``And Their
Children After Them'' by Dale Maharidge and Michael Williamson.
Maharidge is a reporter and Williamson a photographer for The
Sacramento (Calif.) Bee.
   Their book was a 50-year follow-up on the descendants of three
tenant families in Alabama who were made famous by James Agee and
Walker Evans in the book, ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.''
   ``Machiavelli In Hell'' by Sebastian de Grazia won the biography
Pulitzer. The Chicago native has been a Rutgers University
professor of political philosophy since 1962.
   Charles Simic's ``The World Doesn't End'' won for poetry. The
Stratford, N.H., resident had been nominated for a Pulitzer once
before for his ``Selected Poems: 1953-83.''
   The Pulitzer for music went to ``Duplicates: A Concerto for Two
Pianos and Orchestra'' by jazz and classical pianist Mel Powell.
   Powell, 67, started playing with the Benny Goodman Orchestra as
a teen-ager, later joining the Glenn Miller Air Force band. He
currently heads the composition faculty at the California Institute
of the Arts.
   Wilson's ``The Piano Lesson,'' which takes place in Pittsburgh
in 1936, concerns a sharecropper who wants to buy the land his
grandfather worked on as a slave and is willing to sell the family
heirloom, a piano, to pay for it.
   The play, which was one of the finalists last year, opens Monday
on Broadway. Wilson won in 1987 for ``Fences.''
   The prizes, recognizing outstanding work in journalism and the
arts, are awarded by Columbia University. Pulitzer winners receive
$3,000 in each category.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II washed the feet of 12 elderly
priests on Thursday as he commemorated Christ's Last Supper at a
Mass celebrated for thousands of people.
   Earlier, he said Holy Thursday Mass in St. Peter's Basilica,
leading some 2,000 clergymen in renewing their priestly vows.
   The ceremonies marked the beginning of the most solemn and holy
period of the year for Roman Catholics, climaxing with Easter on
Sunday.
   At the evening Mass at the basilica of St. John Lateran, the
white-robed pope knelt before each priest, washed their feet, then
kissed them in a reenactment of part of Christ's Holy Thursday
supper with his 12 apostles. The ritual symbolizes Jesus' humility
before he was crucified on Good Friday.
   The 12 priests were from the diocese of Rome, three of them
former missionaries.
   In his homily, John Paul described how the sacrament of the
Eucharist, or turning of bread into Christ's body, represented
Jesus' death and resurrection.
   Catholics believe the sacrament as well as the Mass and the
priesthood were established at the Last Supper.
   The pontiff urged all Catholics to follow Christ's example of
offering himself for others.
   ``What could we want more on this ... Holy Thursday, than solely
and above all that which the Teacher himself showed in the washing
of the feet?'' he asked.
   He prayed for ``a true sharing of goods and for mutual
understanding among different social classes.''
   About 5,000 people attended the Mass at St. John Lateran, which
is considered the pope's special church as bishop of Rome.
   On Friday, the pope planned to carry a wooden cross in a Good
Friday procession near the Colosseum. He will celebrate the Easter
vigil on Saturday night followed on Easter Sunday by a Mass in St.
Peter's Square.

   The bodies of 25 people, some of whom
had been missing for months, were found buried in a common grave in
northern Colombia, a police general said Thursday.
   Gen. Octavio Vargas, the chief of police operations, said the
bodies were found Wednesday near the town of Valencia on the
property of Fidel Castano.
   Authorities have accused Castano of leading a right-wing death
squad that has killed several leftists and union leaders.
   Some of the bodies were victims of a mass kidnapping Jan. 13 in
the town of Pueblo Bello, Vargas said in a radio interview. An
unidentified group abducted 39 people in the town in the northern
Uraba region, where death squads and leftist guerrillas are active.

<TEXT>
   Republican Party chairman Lee Atwater,
described as ``in fighting trim,'' was released Thursday from a New
York hospital where he was treated for a brain tumor.
   ``He's in excellent spirits,'' said Dr. Paul Kornblith, the
neurologist who treated Atwater at Montefiore Medical Center.
``He's quite enthusiastic; he's gaining strength physically.''
   Kornblith led a team that implanted radioactive isotopes in the
tumor on the right side of Atwater's brain. Physicians hope the
isotopes will halt the growth of the tumor and kill the cancerous
cells.
   The 39-year-old Atwater also is undergoing chemotherapy
treatments designed to destroy any tumor cells on the periphery of
the lesion.
   Kornblith said it would be two or three months before it could
be determined how effective the treatments were. If successful, he
said a neurological scan would show ``the area has diminished in
size or is not growing.''
   While no further radiation was planned, Atwater will continue
taking oral doses of chemotherapy every six weeks.
   Aides have said Atwater would spend the next couple of weeks at
his Washington home regaining his strength.
   ``Knowing him, I think he's going to be working to some degree
probably by next week,'' Kornblith said. ``He's in fighting trim
and ready to fight the wars of his profession.
   ``He's already working, he's meeting with people, talking to
people. How active he'll be, he'll have to judge for himself.''
   Mary Matalin, chief of staff at the Republican National
Committee, said she talked to Atwater on the telephone as many as
six times a day while he was hospitalized.
   Atwater also talked by telephone nearly every day with President
Bush and White House staff chief John Sununu.
   Former President Richard M. Nixon sent Atwater a copy of his new
book, ``In the Arena.`` It was inscribed: ``To Lee Atwater. I can't
think of anyone I'd rather be in the arena with.''
   Atwater's wife, Sally, was expecting to give birth to their
third child within days. Atwater also was celebrating the release
of a rhythm and blues album, ``Red, Hot and Blue,'' on which he
plays guitar and sings with blues artists B.B. King, Isaac Hayes
and Billy Preston.
   The album was selling out in stores in the nation's capital,
Matalin said.
   Kornblith said tumor-related problems Atwater was having on his
left side, had ``gotten a hell of a lot better. He thinks he'll be
able to play the guitar soon.''
   As for the coming weeks, Matalin said it would be ``a different
kind of waiting. The radiation waiting was, for his instincts, that
was not a good procedure. It just didn't match his personality. It
was too slow a process for him.''
   The tumor was diagnosed March 6 after Atwater collapsed while
speaking at a political breakfast. It first was described as a
non-malignant growth that could be treated easily with daily
radiation doses.
   Atwater was given medication to prevent additional seizures and
to ward off nausea from the radiation treatments. He briefly
re-entered a Washington hospital two weeks later after suffering
dizziness attributed to problems adjusting the dosage of his
medication.
   He flew to New York on April 2 to enter a new and more
aggressive treatment program under Kornblith.
   After examining Atwater, Kornblith said that while the tumor was
``quite small'' it was ``aggressive and dangerous.'' The growth,
called an astrocytoma, is the most common type of brain tumor.
   Tumors undergoing unrestrained growth cause pressure within the
closed skull that could kill normal brain cells, bringing eventual
death by destroying vital functions.

   Poor Brazilians do not have to observe
a traditional ban on eating meat on Good Friday, said Roman
Catholic Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns.
   What's important, Arns said, ``is for the poor to eat.''
   About 85 percent of Brazil's 150 million people are Catholics.
At Easter time, the increased demand for fish sends prices up.
   The most Rev. Angelo Sandalo, an assistant to Arns, said, ``It's
meaningless for the poor to be told they cannot eat meat on Good
Friday when they hardly eat any meat at all. In fact, they hardly
ever know where their next meal will come from.''

   Shells crashed into east Beirut and the
Kesrouan province north of the capital Thursday as rival Christian
gunners fought daylong shelling duels.
   Samir Geagea's militia released five Moslem suspects it had held
for more than two years on charges of ``disrupting order'' in the
Christian enclave.
   The militia command, in a statement, said the move was a
``goodwill gesture'' on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the
civil war, which broke out April 13, 1975.
   The five were released from Geagea's war council headquarters in
east Beirut and turned over to the International Committee of the
Rctors of Kesrouan with machine-gun fire from their
mountaintop positions.
   Aoun's men control the Metn mountains that border the eastern
flank of Kesrouan Province. The southeastern sector of east Beirut
and the city's eastern suburbs also are dominated by Aoun's army.
   Geagea's militia controls the provinces of Kesrouan and Byblos
north of Beirut as well as the capital's waterfront.
   The thud of exploding shells echoed across Beirut as local radio
stations interrupted regular programming to flash reports of the
confrontation.
   Geagea's command, in a statement broadcast by Voice of Lebanon
radio, blamed the escalation on Aoun. It accused him of ``blocking
Geagea's peace offensive that aims at turning over our areas to the
legitimate authorities.''
   Aoun's Radio Lebanon accused Geagea of ``selling out the
liberated areas to Syria's surrogates.''
   Geagea repeatedly has urged the Syrian-backed government of
President Elias Hrawi to take over army garrisons and government
installations in the Christian enclave.
   Aoun has rejected Hrawi's election Nov. 24. Hrawi was elected in
line with an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end Lebanon's civil
war. Aoun refused to accept the plan because it did not include a
timetable for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   Geagea has said the plan was a way to peace and recognized Hrawi
as the head of state.

<HEAD>Higher Pay for Government Nurses Proposed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Affairs Department wants to
reverse its shortage of registered nurses by pegging pay to local
rates in private hospitals.
   While the plan would apply only to registered nurses, it would
move the government in the direction of paying its employees at
levels comparable to those of private industry, a goal of unions
that represent federal workers.
   ``It could be the precedent that gets us going through the work
force,'' said Janice Lachance, spokeswoman for the 700,000-member
American Federation of Government Employees.
   Draft legislation, given to the Senate this week, also would add
pay incentives for nurse managers and supervisors.
   The Veterans Affairs Department is the nation's largest employer
of registered nurses, with 35,000 of them at work in its hospitals,
clinics and nursing homes.
   Starting base pay for a registered nurse employed by the
department is $18,174. The American Nurses Association, the average
starting salary nationwide for a registered nurse is $25,261.
   The American Federation of Government Employees had opposed
co-called locality pay in the past. But it now favors the concept
as long as such a system includes safeguards advocated by the
union. Ms. Lachance said she did not know whether the department's
bill included those safeguards.
   The administration last month proposed a pay scale for federal
employees that accounts for local pay. But the federal employee
unions object to a feature of the proposal that eliminates ``step''
increases in certain job categories and instead links pay to
performance.
   Under the proposal made by Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J.
Derwinski, the department would use pay data from private hospitals
to establish ``community rates.''
   But the national scale for nurses employed by the department
would serve as a floor under their pay and the community rates
would go into effect only if they exceeded that level.
   Also, limits on certain categories overtime for some nurses
would be lifted and pay rates would be flexible for certain
nurse-specialists. Premium pay increases would be given to head
nurses and incentive pay would be allowed for nurse managers and
executives.
   The department already has made some adjustments to move closer
to local rates, but the process has proven so slow that the
government has not caught up with levels in the private health care
industry.
   The department was paying special rates at 130 of its 172
medical centers at year ago, Derwinski said.
   ``Even with the special rates, VA has not been able to offer
competitive salaries at certain geographic locations'' such as
Boston, Southern California and New York City, Derwinski said in a
letter to lawmakers.
   Committees in both the House and Senate have been working on pay
legislation for nurses and a similar measure for physicians and
dentists also is on the drawing board.

   A former top legal adviser to U.S.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is the target of a federal
investigation of alleged cocaine use by public officials and
professionals, sources said Thursday.
   Henry G. Barr of Mechanicsburg, who was general counsel when
Thornburgh was governor and later was an assistant to Thornburgh
when he became attorney general, is being investigated by the same
grand jury that has been hearing evidence about alleged cocaine use
and distribution by Richard Guida, a former top deputy in the state
attorney general's office, the sources said.
   The sources, including several lawyers close to the case who
were interviewed independently, said Barr's attorneys were in
Washington earlier this week asking the Justice Department to block
an indictment that would name Barr.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said
Thornburgh and members of his personal staff withdrew from the
federal investigation when they learned of its existence earlier
this year.
   Eramian added that Thornburgh had no knowledge of the drug issue
when he was governor.
   The sources also said Guida has agreed to plead guilty to one
count of using cocaine and to cooperate with the federal
investigation. Under the agreement, they said, Guida could face a
short jail term and suspension of his law license.
   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because grand jury
proceedings are supposed to be secret.
   According to court documents, Guida has been a target of the
federal investigation since May. The grand jury's attention turned
to Barr more recently, the sources said.
   Barr did not return telephone messages left on the answering
machine at his Mechanicsburg home Thursday.
   Guida did not return messages left at his Harrisburg law office.
In previous interviews, he denied using cocaine and being a target
of the probe.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Gordon Zubrod declined to comment
because of a policy that prohibits federal prosecutors from
confirming or denying details of investigations.
   By being allowed to plead guilty only to a possession charge,
Guida would sidestep allegations that he also sold cocaine and
provided it to friends. At least one witness, Brenda Snell of
suburban Harrisburg, said in an interview with The Associated Press
that she told the FBI she had purchased cocaine from Guida and sold
it to him on several occassions.
   Guida called those allegations ``bold-faced lies.''
   This is the second time cocaine allegations against Guida have
been investigated. In 1986, when he was a chief deputy under state
Attorney General LeRoy S. Zimmerman, an internal probe found no
evidence to support a radio reporter's allegations that Guida was a
user.
   State Attorney General Ernie Preate Jr. said Thursday he would
not investigate allegations that the initial probe was a whitewash
because the federal grand jury also was looking at that aspect of
the case.
   Barr, 46, worked in the state attorney general's office before
joining Thornburgh's gubernatorial administration. He became
Thornburgh's general counsel about 18 months before the governor
left office in 1987. In Washington, he served as a special
assistant to the attorney general from September 1988 to May 12,
1989.
   Last year, he resumed a private law practice in Harrisburg, but
quit earlier this year after allegations surfaced that connected
him to the case, the sources said.
   Barr and Guida each served as deputy attorney general in charge
of the state attorney general's criminal division. Barr also served
as an assistant U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh from 1969 to 1979.
Through much of that period, Thornburgh was the U.S. attorney in
western Pennsylvania.
   The grand jury investigation has lasted nearly a year.

   The Parliament's apology Thursday to Jews and
other peoples who suffered under the Nazi occupation marks a
dramatic break from four decades of denying a dark past.
   In a concisely worded declaration, the Parliament unanimously
declared null and void the Communist version of East German
history, which trumpeted the virtues of socialism and refused
responsibility for any tragedies inflicted in the past by Germans
on other nations.
   ``We, the first freely elected parliamentarians of the German
Democratic Republic (East Germany), acknowledge the responsibility
of Germans in the German Democratic Republic for its history and
its future,'' the declaration said.
   The declaration was adopted by the Parliament was chosen last
month in East Germany's first free elections after more than 40
years of Communist rule.
   East Germany, like other former Communist countries in Eastern
Europe, has tried to break away from the official Communist
histories that often emphasized ideology over historical accuracy.
   The Parliament's declaration turned first to the horrors of the
Nazi period and acknowledged that ``immeasurable suffering was
inflicted on the peoples of the world by Germans.''
   ``National and racial illusions led to genocide, especially of
Jews from all European countries,'' it said.
   The declaration could help the process of reconciling East
Germany's historical view of the Holocaust with that prevailing in
West Germany.
   West Germany was compelled after World War II to confront its
Nazi past. Years ago it apologized for Nazi atrocities and began
paying reparations to Jewish victims.
   East Germany long maintained its Communist leaders were also
victims of Nazi repression, and therefore the country bore no
responsibility for the deaths of 6 million Jews during World War II.
   In its declaration, the Parliament dramatically distanced itself
from the policies of the Communist government toppled from power in
October.
   ``The first freely elected Parliament in the name of the
citizens of this country admits joint responsibility for the
humiliation, expulsion and murder of Jewish women, men and
children,'' the declaration said. ``We feel grief and shame and
acknowledge this burden of German history.''
   It asked forgiveness for the bad treatment of Jews who remained
in the country after the war and for East Germany's policy toward
the state of Israel.
   The declaration pledged to do everything possible to cultivate
Jewish culture, and said asylum should be granted in East Germany
for Jews persecuted elsewhere in the world.
   It also said East Germany is prepared to make reparations to
Jewish victims and urged establishment of diplomatic relations with
Israel.
   The declaration then turned to the Soviet Union and Poland,
where millions of people died at the hands of the Nazis.
   ``We have not forgotten the terrible pain that the Germans in
the Second World War inflicted on people in the Soviet Union. ...
We want to intensively continue the process of reonciliation
between our two peoples,'' the declaration said.
   Parliament said that the political changes in East Germany would
not have been possible without Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms.
   It also sought to reassure Poland, which has expressed concern
about German unification.
   The Parliament reiterated the Communist government's earlier
commitments abandoning any territorial claims on former German
lands ceded to Poland after World War II.
   The declaration said Poland's western border along the Oder and
Neisse rivers was inviolable and should be guaranteed by a treaty
passed by the future Parliament of a united Germany.
   The declaration then apologized to another neighbor,
Czechoslovakia, for East Germany's participation in the 1968
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed the Prague Spring
reform movement.
   ``Out of fear and a lack of courage we did not hinder this
breach of international law,'' the declaration said. ``The first
freely elected Parliament in the German Democratic Republic asks
the people of Czechoslovakia to pardon this occurrence of
injustice.''

   Call it sex, lies and Suzukis.
   A Japanese advertising firm said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday
that it had to yank a Suzuki ad campaign featuring Rob Lowe because
of all the bad publicity associated with Lowe's infamous sex tape.
   Now Hakuhodo Inc. wants to collect damages.
   ``We found ourselves with an image different from that which we
felt we had purchased,'' said Hakuhodo's lawyer, John O'Connor.
   The company did not specify damages, but claims it lost more
than $1.6 million in revenues because of its lack of advertising
for Suzuki's Cultus, a car model not sold in the United States.
   Hakuhodo also said it had paid $450,000 to Lowe starting in
August 1988 and another $130,000 to talent agents.
   ``Rob's attorneys ... haven't been given a copy of the
complaint, so there's nothing to comment on at this time,'' Lowe's
publicist, Lisa Kasteler, said Thursday.
   The ad campaign was stopped in May 1989 with release of the
tape, apparently featuring the 26-year-old actor engaging in sex
with two young women. The tape was made while Rowe was in Atlanta
for the 1988 Democratic convention.
   Lowe was ordered to perform 20 hours of community service after
he was charged with sexual exploitation of a minor.

   A man hired to protect Motley Crue band
members during a concert is seeking $25,000 from the heavy-metal
band, claiming its leader hit him in the head with a cowbell during
the show.
   Mark Elrod of Fort Wayne filed the complaint Tuesday in Allen
Superior Court against Motley Crue and Vince Neil, the band leader.
   Elrod's job as a security guard for the March 21 concert
required him to stand between the audience and the band, with his
back to the stage. During the concert, the lawsuit says, Neil
``hurled'' a cowbell toward the audience and it struck Elrod in the
back of the head.
   Elrod claims Motley Crue was negligent and is seeking $25,000 in
damages for medical expenses, missed workdays and personal
injuries, including continual headaches and dizziness.
   He is also is seeking unspecified punitive damages for the
band's alleged ``willful and wanton misconduct.''
   Efforts to reach a spokesman for the band through the
Elektra-Asylum record company in New York were unsuccessful
Thursday. A woman at Elektra records said no one there knew about
the lawsuit. She said she would try to locate a band spokesman.

   Mayor Tom Bradley welcomed this year's Miss
Universe Pageant with a proclamation, raising the ire of some
feminists who say the event is sexist.
   The mayor's decision to support the event was based on economic
benefit for the city, said his spokesman, Bill Chandler. The
international pageant will be held Sunday night in Century City.
   ``In our minds there's no contradiction at all as the mayor
being a supporter of women's issues and proclaiming this year's
Miss Universe pageant,'' Chandler said.
   Bradley and City Council signed a proclamation Wednesday
declaring it Miss Universe Day.
   Tammy Bruce, president of the Los Angeles chapter of the
National Organization for Women, lambasted Bradley for welcoming
the pageant.
   ``It is extremely distressing that society condones this and
that the mayor of the country's second largest city can't see
anything wrong with it,'' she said.
   Sara Meza, publicist fo the Madison Square Garden Television
Productions, said the intent of such pageants are not to demoralize
women, but to entertain the public.
   ``We don't want to tell you it's not a beauty pageant, it is, ''
she said. ``The evening gown, swimsuit and interview, they're all
weighed equally. It is what it is.''

   Pennsylvania's honorary Highway Safety
Month chairman is a man who routinely drives faster than 200 mph
and has been in more than 100 car crashes.
   But when champion race car driver Richard Petty leaves the
racetrack, he says he obeys speed limits and drives smart.
   The seven-time Daytona 500 winner came to the Capitol on
Thursday to endorse Pennsylvania's new highway safety campaign.
   ``There's nobody in the world who has wrecked more cars then
me,'' Petty said. He added that he has ``always been interested in
the safety deal'' and noted that he has six grandchildren to think
about when speeding around the racetrack.
   ``We want everybody to be aware that safety is everybody's
job,'' said Petty, whose 200 NASCAR victories is a record. ``I
drive safely at 200 miles per hour and I'm asking people to drive
safely at 55 or below.''
   But Petty did endorse a 65 mph speed limit for rural interstate
highways in Pennsylvania, a position opposed by Gov. Robert P.
Casey.

   The San Jose Mercury News and The Tribune of
Oakland won Pulitzer Prizes on Thursday for their coverage of last
October's northern California earthquake.
   The Mercury News, which used emergency generators to put out its
post-quake edition, won the prize for general news reporting. The
Tribune's photo staff won for spot news photography.
   When the quake struck Oct. 17, California newspapers from
Monterey to San Francisco were forced to improvise. The Mercury
News not only published its own comprehensive coverage but printed
papers for a competitor. The Tribune's photographs provided a
gripping portrait of the devastation and appeared in newspapers
around the world.
   Tribune Publisher Robert Maynard described the scene in the
newsroom after the announcement as ``an earthquake of happiness,''
and told a caller: ``You're competing with the biggest party the
Tribune has had since 1950.'' That was the year the newspaper won
its last Pulitzer Prize, for a photograph of a near-miss air
disaster.
   Four reporters from The Seattle Times won a prize for coverage
of another disaster. Ross Anderson, Bill Dietrich, Mary Ann Gwinn
and Eric Nalder were given the national reporting award for their
coverage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   The prizes, recognizing outstanding work in journalism and the
arts, are presented annually by Columbia University.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Washington (N.C.) Daily News
won the Pulitzer's gold medals for public service journalism, the
Inquirer for reporting on how the blood industry operates with
little regulation, and the Daily News for revealing that the city
water supply was contaminated with carcinogens.
   This is the first time in 23 years the Pulitzer board awarded
two gold medals. It was the Inquirer's 17th Pulitzer Prize, all won
in the past 15 years, and the sixth straight year the newspaper has
won an award.
   It also was the second award for the author of the Inquirer
series, Gilbert Gaul. Gaul, 38, won an investigative reporting
award in 1979 for his work with The Pottsville (Pa.) Republican.
   ``I feel great. It is a terrific honor,'' Gaul said Thursday.
``The paper showed an incredible amount of courage to allow me to
spend a year and a half on the story and to report on a subject
that is of great importance to everyone that we don't often think
about _ blood.''
   It was the first award for the Washington Daily News,
circulation 10,000, whose office erupted in pandemonium when the
Pulitzers were announced.
   ``I will say we haven't had this much excitement in this town
since the Union cavalry and the Confederate cavalry chased each
other up Main Street in 1862, and there's been nothing like that
since,'' said Bill Coughlin, the newspaper's executive editor.
   Lou Kilzer and Chris Ison of the Minneapolis-St. Paul Star
Tribune won the Pulitzer for investigative reporting for stories
that exposed local citizens' links to members of the St. Paul Fire
Department, and the citizens' alleged profiteering from fires.
   The explanatory journalism prize went to David A. Vise and Steve
Coll of The Washington Post for stories scrutinizing the Securities
and Exchange Commission and its former chairman, John Shad.
   Tamar Stieber of the Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal won the Pulitzer
for specialized reporting for stories that linked a rare blood
disorder to an over-the-counter dietary supplement, L-tryptophan.
The reporting led to a national recall of the product.
   Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn of The New York Times won
the international reporting prize for their coverage of political
turmoil in China. The Times now has won 61 Pulitzer Prizes, more
than any other newspaper.
   Dave Curtin of the Colorado Springs (Colo.) Gazette Telegraph
won the feature writing prize for his account of a family's
struggle after its members were burned in an explosion that
devastated its home.
   Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times won the commentary prize for
his sports columns, and Allan Temko of the San Francisco Chronicle
received the criticism prize for his writing on architecture.
   The prize for editorial writing went to Thomas J. Hylton of The
Mercury of Pottstown, Pa., for editorials about a bond issue to
preserve farmland and open space in rural Pennsylvania. Tom Toles
of The Buffalo (N.Y.) News won the editorial cartooning prize.
   In feature photography, the winner was David C. Turnley of the
Detroit Free Press for photographs of the uprisings in China and
Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Estonia Bans Soviet Draft, Calls for Independence Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Estonian parliament has declared service in
the Soviet army illegal and called on President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to begin immediate talks on the Baltic republic's
independence, Soviet media reported Thursday.
   Estonia's new law on conscription says ``service by residents of
Estonia in the U.S.S.R. armed forces is legally illegitimate,'' and
does away with criminal penalties for draft-dodgers.
   The parliamentary move, accompanied by a strident letter to
Gorbachev also approved Wednesday, stepped up the push for
independence in the small republic of 1.6 million residents.
Estonia has made clear it intends to follow neighboring Lithuania
in seceding from the Soviet Union, but more cautiously.
   There was no immediate response Thursday from the Kremlin to the
Estonian legislature.
   The law on the draft raised the prospect of new tensions. When
Lithuania's legislature passed a similar measure last month, the
Kremlin rejected its legality and ordered the army to detain
deserters anyway.
   Military authorities raided two Lithuanian hospitals where
deserters had taken refuge, and witnesses said they beat some of
the men in the first reported violence after Lithuania's March 11
declaration of independence.
   The Lithuanian lawmakers have since issued statements saying
each young conscript should decide for himself whether to respond
to his call-up order, and it is not clear how the army plans to
enforce the draft. In other Soviet republics with strong
independence movements, including Latvia and Georgia, widespread
draft-dodging is also predicted.
   The state news agency Tass, in its report on the Estonian law,
complained it ``prods hundreds of youths to violate the Soviet law
on universal military service and the Soviet Constitution.''
   Mart Tarmot, an Estonian Popular Front activist, said Thursday
the law's passage had evoked no particularly loud public reaction.
   ``Everybody was expecting it. It was necessary to start sometime
and we've done the first step,'' he said in a telephone interview
from Estonia's capital Tallinn.
   The Estonian legislature's letter to Gorbachev laid out
Estonia's legal claims to independence and concluded with an appeal
``to immediately begin negotiations between the U.S.S.R. and an
authorized Estonian delegation on the restoration of independence.''
   Estonia, like its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Lithuania, was
forcibly annexed to the Soviet Union in 1940.
   The letter tacitly rejected Gorbachev's demands in an angry
telephone call last week to Estonian President Arnold Ruutel that
the republic back down from its drive for independence.
   Ruutel said Gorbachev called him up soon after the Estonian
parliament passed its March 30 resolution saying the republic was
an independent country illegally occupied by the Soviet Union.
``When I heard about your resolution I was completely beside
myself. You must declare the resolution null and void,'' Ruutel
quoted Gorbachev as telling him.
   The letter told Gorbachev that if he restored Estonia's
independence, he would eliminate a key source of political tension
in Eastern Europe and raise the Soviet Union's prestige.
   It also assured him that the full rights of all citizens would
be respected in an independent Estonia. About 40 percent of the
republic's population consists of non-ethnic Estonians.
   Since elections last month, the Estonian parliament has been
dominated by pro-secession groups and is expected to pursue
independence as stubbornly as the Lithuanians, though more slowly.

   With two inmates carrying his suitcases,
``Godfather of Soul'' James Brown started a brand-new bag Thursday.
He was transferred from prison to a work-release center to counsel
youths about drug abuse.
   The two-time Grammy award winner was released after serving 15
months of a six-year prison sentence for aggravated assault.
   He will be locked up nights and weekends at the minimum security
Lower Savannah Work Center 60 miles from Aiken, where he will help
educate young people about the dangers of illegal drugs and alcohol.
   When asked how it felt to be back home in Aiken County, the
56-year-old singer raised his hands and said, ``This is home?''
   Brown was wearing a bright blue shirt, vest and black leather
pants as two inmates helped him carry his three suitcases after his
arrival from the State Park Correctional Center in Columbia. His
job starts Monday. He will earn at least the minimum wage of $3.80
an hour, officials said.
   Brown billed himself as the Hardest Working Man in Show Business
during his four decades as a rhythm and blues singer.
   He grunted, groaned and gyrated to pop stardom with 114 charted
singles such as ``Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,'' ``Please, Please,
Please'' ``I Got You (I Feel Good),'' ``Cold Sweat,'' ``I'm Black
And I'm Proud,'' ``Hot Pants'' and more recently, ``Living in
America.''
   The wavy-haired Brown was imprisoned in December 1988 to serve a
concurrent six-year sentence in Georgia and South Carolina for
failing to stop for police, aggravated assault and weapons
violations stemming from a two-state, high-speed chase that ended
when police shot out the tires on his pickup truck.
   The incident began when a gun-toting Brown stormed an insurance
agency next to his office and claimed strangers had used his
bathroom. Tests showed Brown had used the illegal drug, PCP. He had
earlier been arrested several times for illegal drug use.
   He becomes eligible for parole in South Carolina on May 5, 1991,
and in Georgia in March 1992.
   At the Aiken-Barnwell County Community Action Commission, Brown
will try to talk young people out of using drugs and alcohol, said
George Anderson, executive director.
   ``That name is going to bring the people out,'' Anderson said.
``His name alone can command a crowd. You or I couldn't draw the
attention he will.''
   Reaction to his work-release was less than enthusiastic at Top
Notch Entertainment, Brown's production and booking agency.
   ``He won't be able to leave and go to work here and put his
people back to work such as the band and hairstylists who are out
of work,'' said W.M. Glenn, the company's executive vice president.
   The singer had been offered an array of radio station jobs
across the country. He had been the object of a ``Free James
Brown'' movement that included the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   A year ago, NASA awakened the shuttle crew Discovery with
Brown's ``I Feel Good.''
   Brown also had a volatile relationship with his wife, Adrienne,
39. He was arrested in 1988 for allegedly shooting his wife's car
and attacking her with a lead pipe, but the charges were dropped.
   In July 1988, he was convicted for possession of PCP, resisting
arrest and carrying a pistol. But he violated that probation when
he tested positive for marijuana and PCP. At that time, Brown was
out on bond for his September arrest for leading police on a chase
in South Carolina and Georgia.
   Brown will live in a dormitory with 74 other inmates at the
minimum-security work-release center in a rural, wooded area about
20 miles from Augusta, Ga. Eighty female inmates live in another
building on the campus, which is surrounded by a small fence and
patrolled by unarmed guards.
   While at the State Park Correctional Center, where he was No.
155413, Brown had conducted the prison gospel choir and worked in
the prison cafeteria.
   He also had to forfeit $600 and lost 20 days of time-off for
good behavior for keeping $40,600 in his cell. The Internal Revenue
Service in August confiscated $40,000 in checks, claiming he owes
about $11 million in back taxes.

   Officials of the United States and
Czechoslovakia signed a trade agreement Thursday, the second
economic pact negotiated with an Eastern European nation since last
year's political upheaval.
   The new accord is one of the steps needed to cut tariffs on
Czech products sold in the United States. The document also seeks
to foster increased business ties and tourism between the two
nations.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills participated in the
signing ceremony along with Andrej Barcak, the foreign trade
minister of Czechoslovakia.
   Hills said that the congressional legislation needed to put the
lower tariffs into place could be completed by early summer.
   The United States is also negotiating a trade agreement with the
Soviet Union and Hills said she was optimistic that the pact could
be finished in time for the May 30 summit between President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Both the Czech and Soviet trade agreements are necessary steps
that must be taken for the United States to grant the countries
``most favored nation'' trade status. That designation would lower
American tariffs to the level charged against most other trading
partners.
   Tariffs on products from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia now
run as much as 10 times higher than those on goods from other
countries.
   The higher tariffs were imposed as part of the Jackson-Vanik
trade amendment of 1974, which Congress passed in retaliation for
communist restrictions imposed on the free emigration of dissidents.
   Before tariffs can be lowered, the trade agreements must be in
place and President Bush must certify that both countries permit
free emigration. Both houses of Congress must approve the trade
agreements.
   The president's certification is not expected to be a problem
for either country. Bush has said he will make such a certification
for the Soviet Union once the Soviet Parliament putting into law
the current free emigration policies.
   Last month, the United States and Poland signed a business and
investment treaty. That pact did not address the tariff question
because Poland had already been awarded the lower tariffs under the
most favored nation designation.
   In addition to the treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia,
Hills said exploratory discussions have been held with Hungary on
adopting a new business and economic agreement.
   Czech-U.S. trade is now fairly small, adding up to about $150
million a year in both directions. Major U.S. exports are hides,
yarns, cotton and tobacco; major U.S. imports are tractors, glass
beads, shoes and tires.
   In his remarks to the U.S. business executives, Barcak made a
plea for American investment, saying Czechoslovakia was moving
rapidly toward a market economy.
   He said his nation expected to take a major step next Jan. 1
toward making its currency fully convertible. That would mean that
investors could freely take their earnings home in dollars _ an
important consideration to firms unwilling to tie up their cash
abroad.
   Barcak also promised tax breaks for foreign investors and
permission for them to own all the stock in new firms they
establish, without the need to take in lcoal partners.
   But he said there was an on-going debate over whether foreigners
should be allowed to own land. He said some people in the audience
would be able to buy up all the land in Czechoslovakia with a
single check.
   ``Some of us don't want to live in a country where foreigners
have bought up the land at its present value, and then we have to
buy it back ourselves in five years time,'' he said.

   Officials of the United States and
Czechoslovakia signed a trade agreement Thursday, the second
economic pact negotiated with an Eastern European nation since last
year's political upheaval.
   The new accord is one of the steps needed to cut tariffs on
Czech products sold in the United States. The document also seeks
to foster increased business ties and tourism between the two
nations.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills participated in the
signing ceremony along with Andrej Barcak, the foreign trade
minister of Czechoslovakia.
   Hills said that the congressional legislation needed to put the
lower tariffs into place could be completed by early summer.
   The United States is also negotiating a trade agreement with the
Soviet Union and Hills said she was optimistic that the pact could
be finished in time for the May 30 summit between President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Both the Czech and Soviet trade agreements are necessary steps
that must be taken for the United States to grant the countries
``most favored nation'' trade status. That designation would lower
American tariffs to the level charged against most other trading
partners.
   Tariffs on products from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia now
run as much as 10 times higher than those on goods from other
countries.
   The higher tariffs were imposed as part of the Jackson-Vanik
trade amendment of 1974, which Congress passed in retaliation for
communist restrictions imposed on the free emigration of dissidents.
   Before tariffs can be lowered, the trade agreements must be in
place and President Bush must certify that both countries permit
free emigration. Both houses of Congress must approve the trade
agreements.
   The president's certification is not expected to be a problem
for either country. Bush has said he will make such a certification
for the Soviet Union once the Soviet Parliament putting into law
the current free emigration policies.
   Last month, the United States and Poland signed a business and
investment treaty. That pact did not address the tariff question
because Poland had already been awarded the lower tariffs under the
most favored nation designation.
   In addition to the treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia,
Hills said exploratory discussions have been held with Hungary on
adopting a new business and economic agreement.
   Czech-U.S. trade is now fairly small, adding up to about $150
million a year in both directions. Major U.S. exports are hides,
yarns, cotton and tobacco; major U.S. imports are tractors, glass
beads, shoes and tires.
   In his remarks to the U.S. business executives, Barcak made a
plea for American investment, saying Czechoslovakia was moving
rapidly toward a market economy.
   He said his nation expected to take a major step next Jan. 1
toward making its currency fully convertible. That would mean that
investors could freely take their earnings home in dollars _ an
important consideration to firms unwilling to tie up their cash
abroad.
   Barcak also promised tax breaks for foreign investors and
permission for them to own all the stock in new firms they
establish, without the need to take in lcoal partners.
   But he said there was an on-going debate over whether foreigners
should be allowed to own land. He said some people in the audience
would be able to buy up all the land in Czechoslovakia with a
single check.
   ``Some of us don't want to live in a country where foreigners
have bought up the land at its present value, and then we have to
buy it back ourselves in five years time,'' he said.

<HEAD>Cost of Major Programs Up 3.8 Percent from September Estimate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The estimated cost of the Pentagon's major
weapons programs increased by $31 billion or 3.8 percent in the
last quarter of 1989 because of inflation and a slight increase in
planned missiles and ships.
   The Pentagon, in its congressionally required report released
Thursday, offered a snapshot as of Dec. 31 of expected overall
costs for 95 major weapons systems if President Bush's military
budget is enacted.
   However, the overall estimate, now $843.8 billion, may change,
given that Congress or Defense Secretary Dick Cheney may limit
production on or terminate some weapons systems, including the C-17
cargo plane and the DDG-51 guided-missile destroyer.
   The previous report, released in September, predicted the
overall cost of the major systems would be $806.6 billion. Upward
revisions in expected inflation rates are largely responsible for
the higher costs, the Pentagon said.
   The difference in the two figures is $37.2 billion, but
comparisons on an apples-with-apples basis give a difference of $31
billion because the new estimate includes $6.2 billion for a Navy
program that was not in the September figure.
   That program is the so-called ``Fixed Distributed System,'' a
classified ocean surveillance project.
   One of the major increases was for the Midgetman strategic
nuclear missile, now put at $7.3 billion, an increase of $1.9
billion or 35 percent over the previous estimate.
   The Pentagon said the jump was primarily the result of restoring
costs expected all along but excluded last year because of the way
Bush and Congress handled Midgetman in the current defense budget.
   The fiscal 1990 budget contains less than $250 million for the
mobile, single-warhead, land-based missile. With those funds, the
Midgetman program amounted to a research and development project.
   ``This is a reinstatement of the costs,'' said Roy Lietza, a
spokesman for the Air Force.
   Among the increased costs for the Midgetman are $1.3 billion for
the missile and its basing with a goal of initial operation in
1997; $458 million for six additional research and development
missiles and $87 million for inflation.
   The estimated cost of the multiple-warhead MX nuclear missile
dropped $3.9 billion from $23 billion, primarily because of a
reduction in the number of planned missiles from 255 to 193. The
drop was partially offset by inflation increase estimated at $236
million.
   The estimates consist of the annual costs of research and
development, purchase of the weapon itself and associated
construction, added together for the several years each weapon will
be bought, sometimes extending into the next century. Cost of
operations, such as fuel and crew wages, are not included.
   One program which Cheney is currently reviewing _ the Arleigh
Burke-class destroyer or DDG-51 _ increased $4 billion from a
previous estimate of $2.8 billion.
   The Navy cited an increase in the number of ships from 33 to 38
and revised inflation rates as the reasons for the 15 percent jump.
   The other Navy program the defense secretary may curtail _ the
SSN-21 Seawolf attack submarine _ dropped in estimated cost from
$20 billion to $16 billion because of a decrease in the number of
submarines from 12 to nine.
   The estimated cost of the C-17 cargo plane, also under review,
increased $4.4 billion from a previous price of $37.4 billion. The
Air Force blamed the rise on inflation and schedule changes due to
plans to stretch out the program.
   Slower production rates frequently raise total costs by reducing
production efficiency.
   One of the largest increases in Army programs was in the medium
tactical vehicles in which the estimated cost jumped from $8.6
billion to $16.1 billion, or 88 percent.
   The Army attributed the rise to an increase in the number of
trucks from 79,157 to 102,322, an extension of the modernization
program from 15 to 30 years, schedule changes and inflation.
   The estimated cost of the M-1 tank, which Cheney has proposed
canceling in the budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1,
dropped $6 billion due to a decrease in the number of tanks.

   An Illinois-based chain of art galleries and
two company officials have agreed to pay $635,000 to customers who
bought prints believing they were the work of Dali, Chagall,
Picasso and Miro, the government said Thursday.
   The prints were worth $50 each, but Austin Gallaries,
headquartered in Palatine, Ill., collected a total of about $2
million at galleries in Chicago and California, said Heather
Hippsley, a Federal Trade Commission attorney.
   Customers were told the prints would be good investments, the
FTC said.
   Austin and its president and sole shareholder, Donald Austin,
will pay $625,000. Another Austin official, JoAnne Granquist, will
pay $10,000, the government said.
   The FTC will notify Austin customers of the settlement; Ms.
Hippsley said she did not know how many people that included.
   As part of the deal, which will become final when approved by a
federal judge in Chicago, Austin also will surrender 400 prints the
government claims are fakes.
   Donald Austin was not available for comment Thursday.
   Ms. Hippsley said he had promoted the prints as originals by
Salvador Dali, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro and sold
them at prices ranging from $600 to several thousand dollars, .
   ``Austin will be allowed to sell other Dali or Chagall graphic
art as long as they do not represent that the prints are ... by the
artists,'' the FTC said.
   Austin has galleries in Chicago and three California cities _
San Francisco, Carmel and Laguna Beach.

   Federal investigators have filed a complaint
charging that Immigration and Naturalization Service officials
unlawfully retaliated against undercover agents in Houston for
writing to their congressmen.
   The complaint filed Wednesday with the federal Merit systems
Protection Board said the retaliation came after the anti-smuggling
agents told lawmakers their undercover identifies were compromised
by a change of assignment.
   The 18-count complaint was filed by the U.S. Office of Special
Counsel. It sought disciplinary action against three officials of
the Houston district office of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
   Named in the complaint were District Director Ronald Parra,
Deputy District Director Michael McMahon and Carey Murphy,
assistant district director for investigations. It alleged that
they engaged in ``prohibited personnel practices.''
   The agents complained about a switch from anti-smuggling duty to
employer-relations work created by a 1986 immigration law. Not only
were their undercover identities jeopardized, they said, but they
were told to falsify time cards and record time spent on employer
relations as anti-smuggling hours.
   After writing to lawmakers, the six agents and two supervisors
received low performance appraisals or were pressured to take
unwanted transfers, according to a separate investigation by the
General Accounting Office.
   INS spokesman Duke Austin said the Merit Systems Protection
Board is the ``appropriate forum'' for the complaints and would not
comment further.

   President Bush was diagnosed Thursday with
``an early glaucoma'' in his left eye, but he said it had not
affected his vision.
   The glaucoma was found during the president's routine physical
at Bethesda Naval Hospital, and will be treated with prescription
eye drops, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.
   Otherwise, the 65-year-old Bush ``is in excellent health,'' said
White House physician Dr. Burton Lee in a statement released by the
press office. ``He continues to keep extremely fit through vigorous
physical activities.''
   ``I haven't felt a thing, felt it at all,'' Bush told reporters.
``I'm taking drops now ... one in the morning and one at night, but
the vision is very good.''
   Fitzwater's statement said that during the examination, ``An
early glaucoma of his left eye was detected,'' but that extensive
tests showed no visual impairment.
   With early detection and continual treatment, the president
should not develop vision problems, said Dr. Mansour Armaly,
chairman of ophthalmology at George Washington University Medical
Center, who did not examine Bush but is a specialist in glaucoma.
   Although Bush is not suffering impairment of his vision,
glaucoma can lead to blindness if not treated. The disease is
characterized by increased pressure and hardening of the eyeball.
   It has no cure, but can be controlled with drugs. Laser surgery
may be performed on patients who don't respond to drugs, Armaly and
other doctors said.
   ``It is quite a high probability he will have none,'' Armaly
said when asked about the prospects for vision problems. ``It is a
disease that requires regular follow up to make sure the medication
is effective.''
   For the glaucoma, ``he will receive Betagan eyedrops, one drop
every 12 hours, and will continue this medication permanently,''
Fitzwater said.
   Bush has had a stye in his right eye for the past week, which is
nearly gone after treatments with soaks and antibiotics, Fitzwater
said.
   Betagan, the brandname for the drug levobunolol, is a
betablocker _ similar to those that treat arterial high blood
pressure _ that lowers the ocular pressure, said Armaly.
   There are different types of glaucoma, but all cause pressure
within the eye as result of obstruction to the micro passages that
allow ordinary fluid to leave the eye at the normal rate into the
blood vessels, he said.
   Unless the glaucoma is transitory, resulting from something such
as a previous blow to the eye, it is considered a lifetime
condition, he said.
   Dr. M. Bruce Shields of the Duke University Eye Center in
Durham, N.C., said once glaucoma is found in one eye it often
appears in the other, but treatment can also save the sight in the
second eye.
   The White House reference to ``early glaucoma'' apparently means
the nerve was not damaged enough to affect Bush's vision, said
Shields, who is chairman of the glaucoma committee of the National
Committee to Prevent Blindness.
   Glaucoma is not unusual in a person in his 60s, Shields said.
   The NSPB estimates more than 2 million Americans ages 35 and
over have glaucoma, but that nearly half are not aware of it. The
society says the disease accounts for one out of every eight cases
of blindness in the United States.
   ``The vision is very good, the vision thing's working well,''
Bush told reporters Thursday, joking about his habit of attaching
the word ``thing'' to topics. Critics during his 1988 presidential
said he lacked ``the vision thing.''
   During the four hours of tests and examinations, doctors also
found that Bush's hips and neck showed ``mild degenerative
osteoarthritis,'' a condition revealed in past physicals.
   The White House said he also underwent chest X-rays, which were
normal; an electrocardiogram and stress tests, which were normal;
urinalysis showing no abnormality; blood tests which were normal; a
dermatology exam, showing ``no significant problem or change.''
   ``His allergy problems remain minimal and unchanged,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Bush emerged from the examination, wearing sunglasses because
his eyes had been dilated, and called to reporters that he felt
``like a spring colt.''
   He told reporters ``all is well'' on his return to the White
House.
   The president's last physical was May 10, 1989, and he was
pronounced in good health.
   The only problem cited during last year's physical was a cyst on
the third finger of Bush's right hand. The cyst was surgically
removed last October and later was found to be benign.

   American Jewish leaders welcomed the East German
Parliament's ``long overdue'' apology Thursday for the Holocaust,
and said the new government must include education in its effort to
make amends.
   ``Apology must be accompanied with deeds,'' said Benjamin Meed,
president of the 65,000-member American Gathering-Federation of
Jewish Holocaust Survivors. ``They must educate future generations
to know what their fathers did and how they will prevent it from
happening again.''
   ``It is 45 years overdue, but apology is always good,'' added
Meed, a 70-year-old survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto.
   By making the apology, East Germany's first freely elected
legislature ended four decades of denials by its former Communist
leaders that the country played any role in the deaths of 6 million
Jews during World War II.
   ``Nobody can bring back the dead, but it's a long overdue
statement,'' said Rabbi A. James Rudin, director of interreligious
affairs of the 50,000-member American Jewish Committee.
   East Germany's legislature also promised to make reparations to
Israel and to seek diplomatic ties with that country. Israel has
long demanded reparations and an East German apology for Nazi
crimes as a condition for diplomatic relations.
   ``Before you can have normalization, there had to be admission
of guilt, remorse, said Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a Holocaust survivor
and president of the interreligious Appeal of Conscience Foundation.
   ``This is a first step in a normalization process and it has to
be advanced by education and re-education,'' said Schneier. ``All
these years East Germans were conditioned to the fact that `We had
nothing to do with it.' It is a great challenge to educate the
public and particularly the younger generation as to the tragedy of
the Holocaust so that another tragedy of this kind would be
averted.''
   Rudin urged East Germany not only to pay reparations for the
Holocaust but to join with the United States and other countries to
seek repeal of the 1975 United Nations resolution equating Zionism
with racism, ``which was an act of anti-Semitism.''
   ``Since they've apologized for terrible errors of the past, this
is something else they can do to show good will and that they've
really changed,'' Rudin said.
   ``Unhappily, East Germans have followed the practice until now
of seeking to deny what had been their history,'' said Philip Baum,
associate executive director of the American Jewish Congress.
``While the people alive now are not those who perpetrated the
crimes, they have the burden of the history of their country to
confront and this is a gratifying sign that they're doing it.''
   ``Without self-recognition, one can't begin other steps of
education, and that's why this is terribly important,'' said
Kenneth Jacobson, director of the Anti-Defamation League division
of international affairs.
   ``For the last 40 years East Germany has denied any role and now
they're beginning to look history in the eye,'' Jacobson said. ``I
don't think too many youngsters in that part of the world really
understand what went on.''

   President Bush said Thursday the United States
and Japan must resolve more disputes to ease trade tensions but
that ``great progress has been made'' with an agreement reached
last week.
   In a meeting in the Cabinet Room, Bush congratulated Trade
Representative Carla Hills, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady for the success of U.S.-Japanese
negotiations that resulted in the trade accord.
   ``It was well done,'' Bush said. ``I can't remember a one-month
period in our relations with Japan like the one between Palm
Springs and now.''
   Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu met in Palm
Springs, Calif., in March to discuss trade tensions arising from
the $49 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   Bush said Kaifu ``has exemplified the best in cooperation and
leadership. He's taken some very strong positions there.''
   Bush told the officials, however, ``Lest any of you feel like
you can totally relax, there are some outstanding issues.'' He
specifically mentioned Japanese restrictions on U.S. forest
products.
   He did say that ``great progress has been made'' on satellites
and supercomputers and telecommunications.
   ``We've got to finish this agenda,'' he said, adding that ``we
want to keep on going. I have a feeling we can get this concluded.''
   ``What's your best bet on the time, Carla?'' Bush said, turning
to the trade official.
   ``It's difficult to give a specific time,'' she replied. ``We
are making progress. But as you put it, Mr. President, we have more
to do.''
   Bush told the officials, ``What she means is, we have more to
do.''
   In last week's agreement, Japan promised to take steps to make
it easier for Americans and other foreigners to do business in
Japan. U.S. negotiators pledged to boost America's ability to
compete internationally by improving the education system,
increasing savings and reducing the federal budget deficit.
   But U.S. trade specialists have expressed doubts over how far
the Japanese will go in implementing the accord, especially in
light of strong political resistance to some of the measures in
Tokyo.

   A jury Thursday convicted a former Sunday
school teacher of first-degree murder for the 1971 deaths of his
wife, three children and mother. He claimed he killed them in part
because he feared for their souls.
   John E. List sat stone-faced as the five verdicts were read
after the jury deliberated nine hours over two days. Jurors
rejected lesser counts of second-degree murder and his lawyer's
contention that List was innocent because of his mental state at
the time.
   The 64-year-old List faces a mandatory life prison term at his
sentencing May 1. There was no death penalty in effect in the state
in 1971.
   ``The state's very gratified,'' said Union County Assistant
Prosecutor Eleanor J. Clark. ``It deserved the verdict. Justice was
not denied because of the delay.''
   List disappeared before authorities found the bodies of his
relatives on Dec. 7, 1971, in the family's 18-room mansion in
suburban Westfield, 25 miles from New York.
   List was arrested in Richmond, Va., last June after a tip to the
``America's Most Wanted'' television show, which featured the case.
   His arrest ended a secret life as a fugitive, spent mostly in
Denver and during which List again took up his profession as an
accountant, returned to the Lutheran church and remarried. He moved
to suburban Richmond in 1988.
   List's attorney, Elijah L. Miller Jr., left the courthouse
without commenting. If a conviction was necessary, Miller urged the
jury to return a second-degree verdict because List's mental
condition made him incapable of ``deliberation,'' one of the
necessary elements a jury must find for first-degree murder.
   Psychiatric experts testified for the defense that List suffered
from a ``obsessive-compulsive'' disorder that made him inflexible
and unable to find solutions to his problems.
   Combined with List's twisted sense of religion, the inability to
support his family and a feeling they were slipping from their
religion left List one option, Miller contended: Kill them so their
souls could find salvation.
   Further pressure came from the shame and burden of his wife's
terminal syphilis, which she caught in 1943 from her first husband.
The disease made her abusive, psychotic, subject to frequent falls
and unable to care for her family, witnesses testified.
   A prosecution psychiatrist testified that although List had an
obsessive personality, he suffered from little more than a mid-life
crisis.
   The bodies of List's wife, Helen, 46, and the couple's three
children _ Patricia, 16; John, 15; and Frederick, 13 _ were lined
up on the floor of their sparsely furnished ballroom. His mother,
Alma List, 84, was found in her third-floor apartment.
   In a filing cabinet, List left a chilling five-page letter
explaining his actions and motives to his pastor. ``P.S.: Mother is
in the hallway in the attic _ 3rd floor. She was too heavy to
move,'' he wrote.
   Police, called by worried neighbors and friends, testified they
entered the home and heard dirgelike religious music playing over
an intercom system.
   Matter-of-fact notes apologized to his in-laws and gave
instructions for settling the family's affairs.
   List told a psychiatrist he shot his wife as she ate breakfast,
then his mother upstairs. After eating lunch, he killed each child
as they came home from school. Then he had dinner, slept in the
house and dropped his car off at New York's Kennedy International
Airport.
   The next day, List got on a train and ended up in Denver.

   NASA on Thursday set April 25 as the
new launch date for space shuttle Discovery and the $1.5 billion
Hubble Space Telescope, the agency's most expensive and complex
payload.
   The first launch attempt was scrubbed four minutes before
liftoff Tuesday when one of Discovery's three auxiliary power units
failed.
   ``The date is based on the decision to remove and replace APU
No. 1 on space shuttle Discovery and to allow time for recharging
the Hubble Space Telescope batteries,'' NASA said in a statement.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a new
power unit was expected to arrive at Kennedy Space Center this
week. Shuttle managers estimate it will take two to three days to
replace the unit, said NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
   It will be the first time NASA has ever replaced an auxiliary
power unit on the launch pad.
   NASA shipped the unit's 15-pound controller, which controls
speed, back to the manufacturer for testing. The manufacturer
informed NASA the controller was fine, indicating an unknown
problem elsewhere in the unit.
   Auxiliary power units steer the ship's three main engines,
control the movements of flaps on the wings and the rudder, lower
the main and nose landing gears, and provide the hydraulics for the
main landing gear brakes.
   NASA will remove the telescope's nickel-hydrogen batteries and
recharge them in a laboratory starting Saturday. The batteries will
power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from the shuttle's
power system during deployment until its energy-collecting solar
panels are unfurled.
   ``This allows the batteries to be serviced under the most
favorable conditions while HST remains in the clean environment of
the cargo bay,'' NASA said., referring to the telescope.
   Empty insect traps were removed Thursday from a payload
preparation room of the launch pad tower. The traps were set up
Wednesday to catch mosquito-like midges, which invaded the
preparation room two weeks ago and delayed the telescope's
installation in the orbiter.
   The telescope's 94-inch mirror, the finest ever made, is
extremely sensitive to any kind of debris.
   NASA had feared the midges may have invaded a payload
preparation room at the launch pad tower again. Traps were set up,
but no bugs were caught and the traps were removed Thursday.
   Hubble's installation in the orbiter was delayed two weeks ago
after several-dozen midges got into the preparation room.
   Discovery's five astronauts will place Hubble in space on the
second day of the five-day mission, delayed since 1983 by technical
problems and the 1986 Challenger explosion. The telescope is to
orbit 380 miles high for 15 years, enabling astronomers to look
back to almost the beginning of time.

<HEAD>World Media Conference Ends With Praise for Perestroika</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-day international media conference closed
Thursday with praise for the Kremlin reforms that allowed the group
to meet for the first time in Moscow.
   The final document of the World Media Conference ``stressed that
revolutionary restructuring in the Soviet Union is of worldwide and
historic significance and positively influences processes all over
the world,'' the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   It said conference participants expressed hope that Soviet
reforms would help establish a new world order based on principles
of equality, cooperation and non-interference.
   The conference concluded with a joint sitting of the Summit
Council for World Peace and the Association for Latin America
Unity, Tass said.
   It quoted former Venezuelan President Luis Herrera Campins as
telling the group that perestroika, the Kremlin's reform program,
``is a gift to all people of goodwill striving for good-neighborly
relations and peace.''
   After the conference, the Latin American group's board awarded
medals ``of freedom and unity'' to Politburo member Alexander
Yakovlev, Pravda editor Ivan Frolov and Presidential Council member
Yuri Osipyan, Tass said.
   About 500 delegates from 60 countries, including more than 40
former heads of state, attended the opening of the association
founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon to encourage East-West
communication in politics, economics and the environment.
   Moon said in his opening remarks Tuesday that it was perestroika
that made it possible for the association to hold its first meeting
in the Soviet capital.
   ``I feel there is no place more appropriate to gather for these
discussions than right here in the Soviet Union,'' Moon said.
   Participants in the conference met Wednesday with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and heard his latest assessment of
the progress of perestroika.
   Gorbachev told the delegation Soviet society ``is leaving the
rallying stage and is becoming involved in real deeds,'' Tass
reported.
   Conference discussion also focused on ecology and media
technology.

   Drug testing in Rhode Island showed that 7.5
percent of 465 women had used cocaine, marijuana, speed or opiates
two days before giving birth, federal health officials said
Thursday.
   While Rhode Island is an urban state, and perhaps more prone to
drug use than more rural ones, the report probably has
underestimated illicit drug use among women giving birth, the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control said.
   ``It's probably important for any state ... to keep in mind the
same thing we discovered,'' said Dr. William Hollinshead of the
Rhode Island Division of Family Health.
   ``There are almost always a number of different substances being
used (by pregnant women), probably much more commonly than we
realize. And this doesn't even touch on our old standard poisons of
alcohol and tobacco.''
   The testing was performed on urine samples from 465 women in
labor at eight hospitals across the state in October and November.
The women were not informed the program was taking place, and only
samples headed for discarding were analyzed, Hollinshead said.
Demographic data about the patients were recorded, but names were
not used.
   Thirty-five samples, or 7.5 percent, tested positive for drugs.
Cocaine was detected in 2.6 percent, marijuana was detected in 3
percent, opiates were detected in 1.7 percent and amphetamines were
detected in 0.2 percent, according to program results reported
Thursday by the Atlanta-based CDC.
   Drug use rates were higher among non-whites than whites _ 10.2
percent to 7 percent. Rates were also higher among women under age
25 than older women _ 9.1 percent to 7 percent. Rates were lower
among women having their first child _ 5.7 percent, compared with
9.2 percent for women having their second or more.
   Hollinshead said he would be hesitant to project Rhode Island
statistics to other states, in part because urban and coastal areas
tend to have higher incidence of drug use than more rural areas.
   Still, the CDC's report noted, ``These rates are probably
underestimated ... because they reflect drug use only within 48
hours of labor and delivery, and because only a limited number of
drugs were assessed.''

<HEAD>U.S. Moving to Restore Relations With Democratic Chile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is moving to quickly
normalize relations with Chile's new democratic government, the
State Department said Thursday.
   This could include the lifting of economic sanctions and the end
of restrictions on military aid and arms sales.
   ``The United States applauds the return to democracy in Chile,''
the State Department said in a statement. ``We hope to normalize
quickly all of our relations with the new government in Chile,
including economic, political and defense relations.''
   The department's statement comes one month after the
inauguration of President Patricio Aylwin to replace dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet.
   Pinochet ruled Chile with an iron hand after the coup that
ousted Socialist President Salvador Allende Gossens in September
1973. Thousands of Allende's supporters were rounded up and many
were tortured or killed.
   Pinochet remains head of the Chilean armed forces.
   But Vice President Dan Quayle, who attended Aylwin's March 11
inauguration in Santiago, said Pinochet assured him he would follow
the policies of the new civilian government.
   The State Department said a review will open soon on Chile's
petition for the restoration of easier tariff treatment of its
exports and its request for renewed participation in the programs
of the Overseas Private Investment Corp.
   Chile was suspended from participation in these programs in 1987
due to workers' rights issues, the department said.
   Organized labor in Chile now strongly supports the ending of the
sanctions, the department said.
   Military aid and arms sales to Chile have been restricted since
1976. The department noted U.S. law bars their restoration until
the Chilean government meets these two conditions:
   _Restores respect for human rights.
   _Cooperates with the United States in bringing to justice those
Chilean intelligence officials suspected of complicity in the 1976
murders in Washington of former Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier
and an American colleague, Ronni K. Moffitt.
   ``We are confident that the new government of Patricio Aylwin
will make every effort to meet those conditions,'' the department
statement said.

<HEAD>Harvard President Criticizes Higher Education's Critics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics have attacked higher education
``more savagely during the past 10 years than at any time in my
memory,'' the president of Harvard University charged Thursday.
   In his 19th annual report, Derek Bok warns that the current
trend toward assailing the state of U.S. education threatens to
weaken the system even more.
   ``Most of the charges are flawed because they ignore basic
conflicts and contradictions in the demands society makes on
universities,'' Bok wrote.
   ``Continued criticism of this kind ... threatens to do needless
damage to the public confidence so important to maintaining a
strong system of colleges and universities.''
   Bok blames the swelling federal deficit and tax cuts of the
1980s for the decline in higher education and the tendency to bash
it.
   ``The political climate of the 1980s gave prominence to public
figures and intellectuals of a conservative bent who saw
universities as liberal strongholds populated by cocksure,
opinionated professors,'' Bok wrote.
   While criticism is always a valid outlet for opinion and change,
Bok believes the attacks on higher education have been unfounded or
made without all the facts.
   ``What is needed ... is not an end to criticism but a criticism
that is less given to rhetorical excess, more careful with its
criteria for judgment,'' Bok wrote.
   Bok addressed several controversial issues, including the
conflict between teaching and research, increasing tuition costs,
curriculum quality and calls from the public to curtail university
spending.
   The teaching-versus-research debate has been especially heated
at Harvard. Last month, the faculty of Harvard Medical School
approved a set of guidelines governing outside work for faculty
members.
   ``One signal comes from all the critics who deplore the neglect
of teaching and the stress that universities place on published
work,'' Bok said. ``The other makes the opposite point through a
system of powerful incentives and rewards that offers fame, fortune
and ample funding to successful scientists and scholars.''
   Bok said that teachers are not always motivated by private gain
when undertaking outside pursuits and that research usually
benefits a university. But he said that schools need to delineate
how much time can be spent on outside pursuits and that
restrictions are inadequate at many institutions.
   Bok also decried what he called ``hostile publicity'' about
rising tuition costs. He most news reports about expensive tuition
are focused on a few high-powered universities such as Harvard,
Stanford, Yale or Princeton when in fact the majority of
undergraduates attend public universities where tuition is less
than $2,000 per year.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's parliament chose Lothar de
Maiziere as prime minister on Thursday and embraced his sweeping
agenda for quickly uniting the foundering nation with West Germany.
   The former Communist nation's first freely elected legislature
also apologized to Jews for Nazi atrocities and promised to make
reparations to Israel and seek diplomatic ties.
   By putting de Maiziere's broad coalition government in power,
the parliament sets up a transitional government whose prime goal
will be to negotiate the terms of creating a single Germany.
   Before parliament met, members of the coalition agreed that a
united Germany should remain part of NATO and that East Germany
should merge its weak currency with West Germany's strong
deutschmark by July 1.
   The coalition also backed a rapid process for unification.
   However, it demanded too that East Germans retain some social
benefits, including housing and job guarantees, as the nation of 16
million residents sheds four decades of socialism for the
competitive free market.
   The historic decisions on Thursday will be followed in the
coming weeks by unification talks with West Germany and the four
World War II allies that divided the countries: the Soviet Union,
United States, Britain and France.
   De Maiziere, closely aligned to Helmut Kohl, appeared to
distance himself from the West German chancellor after the
parliamentary session.
   He said final unification may not come late next year, as Kohl
has said. ``It can be realistic, but it doesn't have to be
realistic,'' he said of Kohl's prediction.
   De Maiziere said merging the nations will depend less on timing
than on the conditions. He said on West Germany's ZDF television
network ``that we must create compatible structures.''
   The 400-member parliament put de Maiziere and his 24-member
Cabinet in power by a vote of 265-108, with nine abstentions.
Eighteen lawmakers were absent.
   With the vote, the new government replaces the Communist
caretaker government that has been running the economically
troubled country since East Germans overthrew the hard-line regime
of Erich Honecker in October.
   In a remarkable string of conciliatory gestures, the Parliament
recognized the legitimacy of Poland's post-war borders, which
include former German lands, and apologized for East Germany's role
in the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   It apologized for the deaths of 20 million Soviets during World
War II, and ended four decades of denials that East Germany's
former Stalinist leaders played any role in the deaths of 6 million
Jews.
   ``Persecuted Jews should be granted asylum in the future in East
Germany,'' the parliament declaration said.
   Israel has long demanded reparations and an East German apology
for Nazi crimes as a condition for diplomatic relations.
   Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, said that ``at first glance, it looks like a positive
announcement.''
   But Parliament Speaker Dov Shilansky, a survivor of the Dachau
concentration camp, said he would never grant forgiveness for the
killing of 6 million Jews during World War II.
   De Maiziere, a bearded, 50-year-old lawyer whose conservative
coalition won in the nation's first free elections on March 18,
rose to power by promising Western prosperity through quick
unification.
   His compromises with the left-leaning Social Democrats, who
finished second in the elections and agreed to join his government,
indicates East Germany will demand some sort of social safety net
for its citizens when it negotiates with West Germany.
   The coalition accord calls for a retention of current
unemployment benefits, retirement insurance and aid to the
disadvantaged. It calls for East Germans to be guaranteed a place
to live and for rent increases to be tied to wages.
   The accord on terms of reunification contained several
compromises that could put de Maiziere at odds with his mentor,
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   The accord calls for a 1-1 conversion of East German marks for
West German marks when the nations merge their currencies.
   West Germany's central bank has proposed a 2-1 rate for all but
small savings accounts.
   The coalition agreement follows Kohl's demand that a united
Germany be part of NATO.
   The agreement said ``it can be assumed that a unified Germany,
during a transition period and until the creation of a collective
European security system, should be a member of a NATO that itself
is transforming its military functions.''
   The Soviet Union wants a new Germany to be neutral. West Germany
now is in NATO and East Germany is part of the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact.
   The strategic future of a unified Germany will be the main
negotiating point when the superpowers take part in the unification
talks, perhaps next month.
   The coalition agreement also said the merger of the two
countries should be based on a West German constitutional provision
that permits direct incorporation of East German territory into
West Germany.
   The Social Democrats had demanded a more gradual system of
unification, with East German states voting separately on
unification.
   Kohl and de Maiziere both favor the faster process.
   Kohl congratulated de Maiziere on his election and offered
``close and friendly'' cooperation in bringing together the German
states after ``decades of forced separation.''
   Although de Maiziere's conservative alliance finished first in
the elections, he formed a coalition with the Social Democrats to
get the two-thirds majority in Parliament needed to win
constitutional changes needed for unification.
   The coalition has proven politically expedient as East Germans,
first enamored of the idea of quick Western prosperity, now are
beginning to fear the loss of their subsidizied homes, jobs and
food.

<HEAD>Appeal Filed in Divorce Battle Over Seven Frozen Embryos</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge's decision to give legal
protection to seven frozen human embryos went far beyond his
authority and should be overturned, a lawyer said in an appeal
filed Thursday.
   The ruling was made last September in the divorce case of Junior
Lewis Davis and Mary Sue Davis. The only issue was what to do with
the eggs that resulted from in-vitro fertilization in December 1988.
   Mrs. Davis testified that she wanted control of the embryos in
an attempt to have children. Davis said he did not want the embryos
used in any fashion without his consent, especially by his ex-wife.
   Blount County Circuit Court Judge Dale Young last September
ruled that ``life begins at conception'' and accorded the embryos
the same legal status as children would have in a custody dispute
between their parents.
   He granted temporary custody to Mrs. Davis, who has since
remarried, but continued an order preventing her from using them
while appeals are pending.
   The appeal filed by Junior Lewis Davis said the judge's decision
was inconsistent with existing laws.
   ``Forty-eight-hour, fertilized embryos kept frozen will enjoy
enhanced protection, while first trimester fetuses will continue to
be legally aborted,'' the appeal said.
   The ruling elevates ``these tenuous, and as yet undeveloped,
laboratory embryos to a legal status that exceeds any in federal
constitutional law or the Tennessee criminal, abortion, or probate
laws,'' according to the appeal.
   The appeal says Young erred by attempting to set a policy, which
is supposed to be reserved for the Legislature. Moreover, the
appeal says, the decision does an injustice to the rights of Davis
to avoid becoming a parent.
   Attorneys for Mrs. Davis, who is remarried and living in
Florida, have 30 days to respond to the appeal.

   Temperatures fell to record lows Thursday in the heart of the
nation, snow fell in the Appalachians and around some of the Great
Lakes, and rain fell along the Rockies and western Plains.
   Lincoln, Neb., hit a record low of 17 degrees and Paducah, Ky.,
dropped to a record 26. Des Moines, Iowa, tied its record of 15 and
Springfield, Ill., tied its record of 23.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 14 at Bismarck, N.D.,
and Philip, S.D.
   The northerly wind pushing the cold air into the center of the
nation picked up moisture from the Great Lakes and produced snow
squalls that left almost 3 inches of snow overnight around
Rochester, N.Y.
   At midday, snow showers were scattered from eastern West
Virginia into southwestern Pennsylvania, over eastern Lower
Michigan and eastern Upper Michigan, and along Lake Ontario in
northwestern New York state.
   Farther west, showers extended over northeastern Montana, and
from north-central Wyoming into south-central Montana.
   Rain and occasional thundershowers reached from eastern New
Mexico across the Texas Panhandle, northern Oklahoma, southern
Kansas, and from north-central Colorado into southeastern Wyoming
and the Nebraska Panhandle.
   Snow fell over northeastern Kansas.
   Unseasonably low temperatures were expected overnight into
Friday for the central Atlantic states and part of the Ohio Valley.
   An advisory for freezing temperatures through the night into
Friday was posted over northern Kentucky, and warnings of freezing
temperatures were posted over sections of inland Virginia and
Maryland, and the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.
   An overnight frost and freeze warning was issued over much of
South Carolina.
   But there were no reports of measurable snowfall or significant
rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 26 at
Saranac Lake, N.Y., to 100 at Palm Springs, Calif.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will call for broader
research into the economic effects of global warming but propose no
timetable for dealing with the the issue at upcoming international
talks, senior officials said Thursday.
   The two-day conference will bring together ministers from 17
countries as well as the European community for a discussion of the
economic impact of global warming and what additional scientific
data is needed.
   ``We want to raise the level of debate ... on the science and
economics of global change,'' Michael Boskin, chairman of the
president's Council of Economic Advisers. told a White House
briefing.
   William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
said the conference ``is not about targets and timetables'' but
aimed at ``forming priorities'' for further research and evaluating
the economic problems posed by the warming of the earth.
   President Bush in February called for the White House conference
and invited senior ministers to attend. The top economic,
environmental and scientific advisers to the heads of state of the
17 countries will participate in the conference which begins
Tuesday.
   With the conference focusing on more research, environmentalists
have renewed criticism of the Bush administration. They urge a more
active response to concerns that the globe will become
significantly warmer by the middle of the next century because of
manmade pollution.
   ``They're just saying no again to taking any steps to deal with
global warming,'' said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club.
   Bush had steadfastly maintained that not enough is known about
the severity of the problem to warrant dramatic moves to reduce the
emissions that are causing the earth to become warmer.
   Some European countries have argued for a stabelization of
carbon dioxide emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil
fuels, by the year 2000.
   Many environmentalists have said such emissions should be cut by
as much as one-fifth by the turn of the century if significant
warming is to be averted.
   The adminstration has argued that such moves, which would
require a dramatic shift toward energy conservation and away from
the burning of fossil fuels, could have severe economic
repercussions and should not be imposed until more is known about
the so-called greenhouse problem.
   Allan Bromley, the president's science adviser, who has been
among those advocating the go-slow approach, said Thursday that the
United States plans to push during the upcoming meeting for
agreement among the participants to expand international research
on both the science of global warming and the economic implications.
   Both Reilly anbd Bromley maintained that some who advocate
stabelization of carbon dioxide emissions have not examined
sufficiently the economic consequences of such a move.

<TEXT>
   A British company's American subsidiary and
one of its divisions agreed to pay $3.95 million to settle charges
that the division overbilled the Defense Department, the Justice
Department announced Thursday.
   The false claims for electric devices made for military aircraft
flight control and fuel management systems were submitted from 1983
through 1986, the department said.
   The settlement was with the American subsidiary of Smiths
Industries of Great Britain and one of its divisions, SLI Avionic
Systems Division, Grand Rapids, Mich.
   The false claims were submitted by the Instruments Division of
Lear Siegler Inc., SLI's forerunner, and it reported the mischarges
to the Pentagon in December 1986, the Justice Department said. SLI
continued to provide information to the government after it took
over Lear Sieger.
   The division overbilled the government when it shifted costs
between accounts that were established for a specific project and
accounts for general research and development, the department said.
   ``This settlement represents precisely the type of voluntary
cooperation that we encourage among all the contractors who
discover billing irregularities,'' Stuart M. Gerson, assistant
attorney general in charge of the civil division, said in a
statement.
   The False Claims Act allows for civil damages to be reduced from
three to two times the government's loss when the company reports
the problem and cooperates during the investigation.

<HEAD>Task Force Says Patients Should Be Able To Refuse Treatment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patients have the right to refuse life-sustaining
medical treatment but active euthanasia is wrong, said a report
released Thursday, nearly a year after a gun-wielding father
disconnected his comatose baby's life support.
   ``The time has come to return control over the dying process to
patients and their families,'' said the report.
   The report was written by a task force formed by Cook County
State's Attorney Cecil Partee after the April 26 incident at
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center.
   Rudy Linares, holding hospital workers at bay with a gun, turned
off his 15-month-old son's respirator and cradled the baby in his
arms until he died.
   Officials at the hospital had refused family requests to halt
life support.
   A grand jury refused to charge Linares with murder. He pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor charge of unlawful possession of a weapon,
and was ordered to seek psychological counseling.
   The report ``should have been done long before, so this wouldn't
have occurred,'' Linares said in a telephone interview Thursday,
adding that he had no regrets over his actions.
   Illinois law allows people to decline life support through
living wills or by assigning power of attorney to a third party.
Model legislation drafted by the task force would allow people to
refuse life support without taking such actions.
   Partee wrote legislation similar to the model bill. It was
introduced last week in the Illinois Senate.
   The task force said a person should be judged capable of making
the decision to end life support before medical officials take such
action. The task force said surrogates could make the decision for
those judged not capable and that parents could decide for children.
   A judicial ruling would be needed only in cases of a dispute,
the task force said, noting that doctors and surrogates should be
immune from criminal prosecution for decisions made in good faith.
   The task force said its report was ``in no way intended to
endorse the practice of active euthanasia or mercy killing.''
   At the time the task force was formed, there were no state court
rulings on the issue. Earlier this year, the Illinois Supreme Court
ruled that life support could be withheld from terminally ill
patients when they are diagnosed as irreversibly comatose and when
a doctor's diagnosis was confirmed by two other physicians.
   The task force's work was praised by Fenella Rouse, director of
the New York-based Concern for Dying and the Society for the Right
to Die.
   ``You don't want to have outsiders who have never been involved
in the person's life making the decision for them,'' she said.
   Linares' dilemma began after his infant son, Sam, swallowed a
balloon in August 1988, blocking his air passage. Paramedics failed
to revive Sam, and he never regained consciousness.
   When hospital personnel refused family requests to withdraw life
support, Linares said he decided to take things into his own hands.
   Although he escaped prosecution and prison, Linares was fired
from his job as a painter. About a week after his son died, he was
hospitalized for taking a mixture of cocaine and the drug PCP. He
later pleaded guilty to a drunken driving charge.
   ``The pressure and the realization that I wasn't going to go to
jail after all got to me,'' Linares said. ``I felt like the drugs
were a way out.''
   Hired as a forklift driver in September, Linares was fired the
day after he started when management learned of his past.
   Linares has a new job fixing machines at an assembly plant, and
attends Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings.
   ``I had two other kids and a good-looking wife,'' he said. ``I
thought, if I fold under now, if I got too depressed, what will
happen to them?''

   This was supposed to be a day of rest for
Pulitzer Prize-winner Oscar Hijuelos.
   Staying at a friend's house in the country, the author had spent
the morning shopping for antiques and browsing in bookstores, and
was looking forward to getting some reading done in the afternoon.
   Then, the phone rang. It was Roger Straus, president of Farrar,
Straus &amp; Giroux, which published Hijuelos' novel, ``The Mambo Kings
Play Songs of Love.''
   ``He doesn't call you very often, but when he does it's good
news,'' Hijuelos said in a telephone interview from Ulster County.
The news couldn't have been better: ``Mambo Kings'' had won the
Pulitzer Prize for fiction.
   ``This is so unexpected,'' said Hijuelos, the son of Cuban
immigrants and a resident of Manhattan. ``I've just been in England
and I was spending the week here to chill out. I didn't even know
when they were going to announce this thing. My mother will be
happy.''
   Mambo Kings Cesar and Nestor Castillo would have understood.
They're the Cuban brothers who immigrated to the United States, and
through their friendship with Desi Arnaz wound up on stage at the
Tropicana and in the living room of Ricky and Lucy Ricardo in
Hijuelos' own special episode of ``I Love Lucy.''
   ``It really started out as a novel about a superintendent who
had a past life,'' Hijuelos said of his second novel. ``His past
life was about music, and then the music took over. It ties into my
Cuban roots and also into my interest in the culture in general.
   ``You always get that second novel-itis,'' said Hijuelos, whose
first novel, ``Our House in the Last World,'' was published in
1985. ``So what happened was simply amazing to me.''
   Hijuelos, born in New York in 1951, originally wanted to be a
rock 'n' roll star, but was turned off by the drug scene. He nearly
quit writing as well, attending a conference in 1978 and finding it
``the most sexist, hierarchal, opinionated, prejudical place I've
ever been on Earth.''
   Fortunately, Hijuelos became friendly with author Donald
Barthelme, who encouraged the young writer to develop his own style
and even offered tips on the secrets of success.
   ``He said if you're good, you eventually get recognized sooner
or later,'' Hijuelos said of Barthelme, who died of cancer last
year.
   ``I figured I had 20 years to go to get these kinds of breaks.
He always spoke about awards as an important kind of thing. I think
it's a way for writers' investing into their future. It helps
people, it helps writers and the readers they identify with.''
   Hijuelos gets letters from people all over the country, telling
him they can relate to the experiences of the Castillo brothers and
expressing curiosity about the world he evokes.
   ``The United States is a country of immigrants and I think
people who are still in touch with feelings of displacement could
tap into the characters in the novel,'' he said.
   ``I guess on another level, people are tired of the `A fits into
B' kind of formulaic novels. I wanted to do something different. I
tried to structure the book musically. I also hope it means that
people feel differently about the kind of people I wrote about.''
   Hijuelos, working on a new novel tentatively titled ``14
Sisters,'' says winning the Pulitzer is just the ``tip of the
iceberg'' for him, and so many others ready to tell their stories.
   ``I think, culturally, the `establishment' has in home-grown
Latin writers a potential source of great literature. Most writing
from ``minorities'' is on small presses and university presses.
Maybe this will encourage publishers to move over a little bit.''

<HEAD>Second-in-Command Says Doomed Ferry Should Never Have Left Port</HEAD>

   Combustible materials were left in
the passageways of a ferry before it caught fire and the vessel was
in such poor shape that it should never have left port, the ship's
second-in-command said Thursday.
   Karsten Hansen, staff captain of the Scandinavian Star, made his
comments before a maritime commission investigating the blaze
Saturday on the 10,500-ton ferry, which was sailing from Norway to
Denmark.
   On Thursday, Norwegian police lowered their estimate to 166
people killed in the disaster. They earlier estimated the toll at
168, but police have said they have no final figure.
   Police said they believe the fire was deliberate. The Danish
shipowner, VR Da-No, posted a $39,000 reward for information
leading to the identity of the arsonist.
   In Larvik, Norway, police said Thursday that 1,639 passengers
and 130 crew members were evacuated from a Norwegian ferry
following a bomb threat. The ferry Peter Wessel, which had left 90
minutes earlier for Denmark, returned to the Norwegian port
Wednesday night after the threat, which proved false, said police
inspector Paal Aartun.
   Hansen told the maritime inquiry that inflammable refuse was
left in corridors while the the ship underwent renovations.
   ``Work was going on all over the ship,'' he said. Carpenters and
painters were finishing renovations of cabins, the bar and other
areas of the ship, which the new Danish owner took over March 30.
   Service personnel often left bundles of bedding outside the
passenger cabins they cleaned, creating a fire hazard, he said.
   ``The authorities should never have allowed that ship to leave
port,'' Hansen said.
   Hansen said some of the catering staff complained of exhaustion
from overwork. He added that he'd heard of friction between crew
members.
   Rescued passengers complained that the crew, mostly Filipino and
Portuguese sailors, appeared untrained to handle a crisis and could
not communicate with passengers. A fire inspector testified earlier
that serious faults were found with fire-containing devices, and
fire fighting equipment was unused.
   According to the ship's emergency roster, Hansen was the ship's
fire chief and was responsible for organizing the crew in an
emergency.
   But during questioning, Hansen said he was unaware of the
regulation, and added he wasn't hired in that capacity.
   Hansen said he and another crewman donned fire suits to rescue
trapped passengers. The two rescued three unconscious passengers
before being taken off the stricken ship by rescue helicopters.
   Hansen said at one point during a search below decks he found a
dead woman clutching an infant, also dead, to her breast.
   The Norwegian captain of the vessel, Hugo Larsen, denied in
testimony Wednesday the safety devices were faulty, but admitted
the crew had not undergone a fire drill, which had been scheduled
for the day after the fire.
   Eighty of the 97 crewmen had been hired within the week before
the disaster, according to witnesses who appeared at the inquiry.

<HEAD>`The Piano Lesson' `A Joyful Play' to Write</HEAD>

   August Wilson says ``The Piano Lesson,'' winner
of the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for drama, was a ``a joyful play to
write.''
   ``I wrote the play in several months, and when it went around
the country for two years, I continued to work on it,'' said the
man who won his first Pulitzer three years ago for ``Fences.''
   Wilson said the idea for ``The Piano Lesson,'' which opens
Monday at Broadway's Walter Kerr Theater, came to him from a
painting by black artist Romare Bearden. The painter's work
inspired another Wilson play, ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone.''
   ``Bearden is a tremendous artist, and I always wanted to make my
plays worthy of his canvasses,'' Wilson said. ``I would be doing a
good thing if I could make them as rich and as full as the life he
expressed in his paintings.''
   The playwright was taken by a Bearden painting of a young girl
sitting at a piano with her teacher standing over her. From it, he
fashioned a family drama of a brother and a sister in Pittsburgh in
1936. The brother wants to buy the land his grandfather worked on
as a slave and is willing to sell the family heirloom, a piano, to
pay for it. The sister wants to keep it.
   Wilson says he was haunted by the question, ``Can you acquire a
sense of self-worth by denying your past?''
   ``nd when I began to work on the play, it began to take on a
larger question: `What do you do with your legacy and how do you
put it to work for you?'''
   ``The Piano Lesson'' is a better play for having had the
opportunity to tour for so long before coming to New York, the
playwright said.
   ``When it started, I never said what happened to the piano,''
the playwright said. ``And I found that the audiences wanted to
know. Now I do answer the question. I found I did not want to make
a choice, but I discovered the choice was built into the play.''
   Wilson was in a Manhattan hotel giving an interview when he
learned he had won the Pulitzer.
   ``I was very surprised,'' he said. ``I wasn't expecting it. I
thought `Wow. This is No. 2.' It made me want to go right to my
typewriter and start another one.''
   ``The Piano Lesson'' is part of a cycle of plays about black
American life during the decades of this century. It's also the
fourth collaboration between Wilson and director Lloyd Richards,
who also directed ``Fences.''
   Their relationship started with ``Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,''
which opened on Broadway in 1984. It was followed to New York by
``Fences'' in 1987 and ``Joe Turner's Come and Gone'' in 1988.
Wilson's newest play, ``Two Trains Running,'' recently opened at
the Yale Repertory Theater in New Haven, Conn., and eventually is
expected to make its way to Broadway.
   When he returns to his home in St. Paul, Minn., after the
opening of ``The Piano Lesson,'' Wilson said he would begin work on
``Moon Going Down,'' set in the 1940s.
   Wilson is the first playwright since Edward Albee to win two
Pulitzer Prizes for drama. Other two-time winners include Robert
Sherwood, George S. Kaufman and Tennessee Williams. Eugene O'Neill
won four Pulitzers, including a posthumous award in 1957 for ``Long
Day's Journey into Night.''

   It's not uncommon for foreign
correspondents to move to Washington after their tours abroad. But
it's usually Washington, D.C., not N.C.
   Bill Coughlin did it a little differently, much to his delight
Thursday when the Washington Daily News won a Pulitzer Prize for
public service journalism.
   ``I feel it's a little ironic after having worked in Moscow and
Vietnam and Beirut _ to find my Pulitzer in a little town on the
Pamlico in North Carolina,'' said Coughlin, 67, a former foreign
correspondent for the Los Angeles Times who was hired as executive
editor of the Daily News a year ago.
   ``It says if you set your standards high enough, you can be just
as good as big town newspapers.''
   The Daily News, whose circulation is 10,700, won the award for
breaking town officials' long silence about the cancer-causing
chemicals tainting the drinking water. The announcement brought
whoops, hollers, marching music and champagne into the newsroom of
the eastern North Carolina paper.
   ``This is quite a moment,'' Coughlin said. ``I will say we
haven't had this much excitement in this town since the Union
cavalry and the Confederate cavalry chased each other up Main
Street in 1862, and there's been nothing like that since.''
   Daily News Reporters Betty Gray and Mike Voss, who wrote the
series about the town's contaminated water supply and the failure
of town officials to notify the 9,000 residents, said the award
made their efforts worthwhile.
   ``All through covering the story, there was a great deal of
pressure,'' said Ms. Gray, 36. ``I'm a native of Washington. I grew
up with the people that were running the city. It was all
worthwhile anyway.''
   The afternoon newspaper, published by former state Sen. Ashley
Futrell Sr., 78, and his son, Ashley Jr., has won statewide awards.
The paper averages 16 pages and is written and edited in three
rooms,
   ``It shows (small-town newspapers) that they have just as good a
chance as anybody else,'' Voss said.
   It all started when Coughlin was at City Hall paying his water
bill last summer. He noticed a message on the back of the bill
saying the water was being tested for a variety of chemicals. He
suggested that Ms. Gray, a former insurance agent with three years'
journalism experience, look into it.
   In September, when the newspaper first reported that the
drinking water contained nine times the safe level of
trihalomethanes, which are known to cause cancer, town officials
said Ms. Gray's article exaggerated the danger.
   But 10 days after the stories began, state officials told
residents to stop drinking water from the Pamlico River. The Marine
Corps set up 24-hour-a-day water wagons.
   A second chemical, even more deadly, was found by state
officials who warned that the risk of cancer for lifelong water
drinkers could be 1 in 250.
   A month later, state officials found similar contaminants
exceeding federal standards in 13 other small communities.
   Voss, 35, said he joined Ms. Gray on the series ``when we saw
what we had.''
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' he said. ``This is a dream come true. It's the
pinnacle of the profession. For a small town newspaper to compete
and take home the biggest and the best is unbelieveable.''
   The two-month water ban was lifted after the city began spending
$14,000 per month on a temporary treatment system using chemicals
besides chlorine. The water now meets federal standards, and state
officials are working with the other towns to clean up their water.
   State Health Director Ron Levine credits the Daily News with the
regulatory changes that perhaps saved hundreds of lives.
   Some town officials disagree with the honor and remain bitter
about the stories that divided this quiet waterfront town. As part
of their stories, Ms. Gray and Voss reported that town officials
had known about the problem for eight years and hadn't told anyone.
   Washington's elected officials have since been voted out.

<HEAD>World War II Fighter Planes Go To Auction For $1 Million and Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Apollo astronauts Wally Schirra and
Buzz Aldrin lent their support Thursday to a museum auction that
aviation buffs hope will do for old airplanes what Sotheby's does
for Rembrandts and Van Goghs.
   ``These planes are works of art in their own right,'' said
Donald Douglas Jr., whose father built the DC-3 and countless other
planes made famous in war and peace. ``We hope this auction does
very well by them.''
   The auction will be held May 19 and 20 at the grounds of the
Museum of Flying, located where Douglas Sr. once ran his aircraft
works.
   Aircraft offered for sale include classic ``war birds'' of World
War II vintage _ Spitfires that gained fame in the Battle of
Britain and P-51 Mustangs that escorted American bombers to targets
over Nazi Germany.
   Bidding on a P-38 twin-boom Lightning fighter built by Lockheed
begins at $1.1 million in the auction catalog.
   A reproduction of a bright red Fokker of the type flown by the
Red Baron's squadron during World War I lists for a modest $25,000.
   The museum, sitting next to the Santa Monica Airport's runways,
is on the site where Army Air Corps planes built by Douglas
departed in 1924 on a historic round-the-world flight.
   One of the biplanes from that flight hangs in the museum.
Another is at the Smithsonian Institution's Air &amp; Space Museum in
Washington.
   Aldrin, whose 1969 moon walk electrified the globe, joined
Douglas and Schirra at the museum preview and joked about space and
flight, nicknames and missions in the clouds and beyond.
   ``You gave me a bit of boost,'' Schirra quipped to Douglas.
   The auction's purpose is to raise funds for the Museum of Flying
and to support scholarships for students who pursue aviation
careers, said David Price, president of the 18-month-old facility.
   ``We believe this will be the most historic auction of antique
aircraft ever,'' said Price. ``It's like mounting a Broadway show.
You don't know if it's going to work until opening night.''
   A few years after the war, Price noted that a shrewd bargainer
could pick up a surplus P-51 Mustang at a country air field for as
little as $2,000. The same plane now commands a $500,000 pricetag.
   A rich history has flamed the passion for planes, Price said.
Hundreds of thousands of people attend air shows every year and the
Air &amp; Space Museum in Washington is the best attended of all the
Smithsonian displays.
   ``The fighter planes hark back to chivalry and knighthood,''
said Price, who operates golf courses when he isn't flying one of
his two Spitfires over the Santa Monica Mountains.
   Volunteers at the museum in Santa Monica point out with pride
that most of the aircraft on display there can be flown.
   ``The kids can smell the gasoline, and they can see that these
airplanes are not relics,'' Price said. ``They are something that
works.''

   Five U.S. senators urged President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq on Thursday to halt efforts to develop nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons, which they said created
``dangerous tensions'' in the Middle East.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said Saddam was seriously
worried that Israel planned to launch a pre-emptive strike similar
to the one in June 1981, when Israeli warplanes bombed an Iraqi
nuclear reactor.
   ``They still remember the 1981 Israeli strike, and I think there
is some fear that that might recur,'' Dole told reporters after
arriving from Iraq.
   His delegation met with Saddam in the Iraqi city of Mosul for 2{
hours. The others in the U.S. delegation were James McClure,
R-Idaho; Alan Simpson, R-Wyoming; Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska; and
Howrd Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel called for international
pressure on Iraq to end such weapon programs, and he declared that
Israel would use ``all the necessary means'' if attacked.
   Western fears over Iraq's arms programs have grown in recent
weeks, and British officials said Thursday they had seized an
Iraqi-bound gun that would be capable of launching nuclear or
chemical warheads hundreds of miles.
   Dole said Saddam was upset by negative press reports about Iraq,
including British revelations two weeks ago that Baghdad had tried
to acquire U.S.-made triggering devices for nuclear weapons.
   ``I think Saddam Hussein believes there is this capability by
America, the British and Israel to tarnish the image of his country
and to send out false statements,'' Dole said.
   In a letter to the Iraqi president, the U.S. senators said
Iraq's arms programs are creating ``dangerous tensions'' in the
Middle East.
   Dole said Saddam denied either possessing or developing nuclear
weapons and insisted he was not trying to make a biological weapon.
   However, NBC News quoted intelligence reports saying Iraq had
developed germ warfare in research at the Salman Pak facility south
of Baghdad. Israeli sources said Iraq was trying to make a weapon
that could spread anthrax, typhoid and cholera but lacked the
technology to package it in a missile warhead.
   Speaking to reporters earlier, Shamir called for international
support in eliminating the threat posed by Iraq's reported chemical
and biological warfare capabilities.
   Shamir, speaking at a park near Jerusalem, said in view of
improving peace prospects in many parts of the world, ``it is very
disagreeable and frightening to hear such voices coming from Iraq.''
   ``These threats have to be eliminated by the pressure of the
whole international community,'' Shamir said in response to a
question.
   Simpson said Saddam had made it clear to the U.S. delegation
that he would launch a full-scale retaliatory strike against
Israel, using chemical weapons, if Israel struck first with nuclear
weapons.

   Police fired tear gas Thursday to end a
Christian protest over a Jewish settlement and fought Palestinian
stone-throwers as foreign tourists visiting the city for Easter
tried to avoid the violence.
   The street battles with young Arabs occurred in Jerusalem's Old
City near the Church of the Holy Sepulcher as thousands of tourists
were visiting this Biblical setting for Easter celebrations.
   The protest by Christian clerics focused on a nearby settlement
of 150 Jews in the Arab Christian quarter. The Jerusalem
magistrate's court, responding to a lawsuit by the Greek Orthodox
Church, ruled late Thursday the settlers must leave.
   However, a spokesman for the settlers, David Ben-Ami, said they
would appeal, and police agreed for now not to expel them.
   Also Thursday, the Palestinian Al-Haq-Law in the Service of Man
human rights group said a Palestine activist killed last week by
soldiers in the West Bank was shot in the back of the head without
provocation.
   The group said the death of Mustafa Ali Tal Shrakeh from the
West Bank's Jalazoun refugee camp was the 19th case in which it
suspected Israeli forces of carrying out a ``willful killing''
during the 28-month-old uprising.
   The army said the youth was killed when soldiers opened fire
with rubber-bullets on stone-throwers. The army has repeatedly
denied it intentionally shoots Palestinians.
   Throughout the occupied territories Thursday 10 Palestinians
were wounded in stone-throwing clashes with troops, Arab reports
said.
   The army confirmed one of the wounded and said it was
investigating the other incidents.
   At least 673 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
and civilians during the uprising and 206 Palestinians have been
killed by fellow Arabs, most as suspected collaborators with
Israel. Forty-three Israelis have also died in the violence.
   The founding of the new settlement during Easter week
particularly angered the Palestinian Christian community, which
perceives it as a threat to their small neighborhood within the
walled city.
   The new Jewish enclave also set off a dispute between Jerusalem
Mayor Teddy Kollek and the Israeli government.
   ``There is no question that the timing of their move lacks
wisdom and sensitivity,'' Kollek said in a statement.
   Thursday's clash in the Old City began when police fired tear
gas and pushed about 200 demonstrating clerics and supporters away
from the Jewish settlement.
   Witnesses said police charged after a priest tore down a poster
picturing an Israeli Star of David that had been pasted over a
cross on the door.
   Greek Orthodox Patriarch Diodorus I was overcome by the gas and
collapsed, witnesses said. Several other clerics were also sickened
by gas, the witnesses said.
   Later Thursday, Arab youths raised an outlawed Palestinian flag
on the roof of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, and police chased
after the youths to the Greek Orthodox patriarchate.
   Witnesses said stone-throwing broke out, and police fired tear
gas and rubber bullets, filling the building with gas and breaking
windows.
   The standoff ended when Kollek, who came to the patriarchate to
extend Easter greetings, intervened with police.
   Tourists wandered through the narrow streets of the city seemed
bewildered, wondering which way to go to avoid trouble.
   Kollek criticized the Israeli government for not intervening,
saying the dispute ``has international repercussions.''
   But Yossi Achimeir, spokesman for Prime Minister Yizhak Shamir,
said Arab Christians were being unreasonable.
   ``Jews are entitled to live everywhere, especially in our
eternal capital,'' Achimeir told The Associated Press.
   Shamir's government has consistently championed the right of
Jews to settle anywhere in Jerusalem, including the Old City and
Arab east Jerusalem, which were captured from Jordan in the 1967
war and annexed.
   President Bush last month raised a controversy in Israel by
repeating that U.S. policy considers the Arab sector of Jerusalem
to be disputed land.
   Jerusalem's Old City, divided into ethnic quarters, is home to
50,000 Moslems, about 7,000 Christians and 4,000 Jews.
   The latest religious dispute began Wednesday when ultra-Orthodox
Jewish families moved into the four-building complex in the heart
of the Christian neighborhood.
   The group that set up the enclave of Naot David, Hebrew for
Dwellings of David, says it bought the building from a Christian.
   In its suit, the Greek Orthodox Church says it owns the 72-room
complex where the Jews moved in under police guard. The church says
the four buildings were sold illegally by a former tenant.
   Ben-Ami said the group was trying to re-establish the Jewish
community that was driven from the area by Arab riots in 1936.

   A judge ruled Thursday that a woman was insane
when she tried to kill a man in what was portrayed as a ritual
honoring Jack the Ripper.
   Deborah Kazuck, 27, was ordered sent to a psychiatric hospital
by Circuit Judge William D. Gardner after he found her innocent by
reason of insanity of attempted first-degree intentional homicide.
   A jury earlier Thursday convicted her of the charge; the judge
decided whether she should be sent to prison or a psychiatric
hospital.
   ``I honestly feel the judge did the right thing here,'' defense
attorney Alan A. Olshan said, adding he didn't think Ms. Kazuck
understood either decision in the trial.
   Her mother, Marilyn Kazuck, left the courtroom crying after the
jury's verdict, telling a reporter her daughter was upset and
suffered from psychological problems that needed attention.
   ``If I was crying, she was probably crying too,'' Mrs. Kazuck
said. ``She needs help. Now most of all she needs help. What they
have done to her _ oh.''
   Mrs. Kazuck said she believed her daughter was the victim of an
unfair police investigation. ``She's innocent completely. She got a
raw deal all the way around.''
   Deborah Kazuck testified Wednesday she never plotted the May 29
attack and only struck the man with the ax when he tried to
sexually assault her.
   But two co-defendants, Ramona Barry and Catherine Lipsham,
testified Ms. Kazuck had asked them to lure the victim, Jeffrey
Meka, 27, to an apartment where they planned to kill him.
   Ms. Barry and Ms. Lipsham, who pleaded guilty to attempted
murder last week under a plea bargain, said they and Ms. Kazuck
regularly looked for victims to ``kack'' _ their code word for
killing.
   Prosecutors told jurors Ms. Kazuck sprang from behind a shower
curtain and slugged the man in the head with a hatchet, intending
to kill him.
   Prosecutors alleged Ms. Kazuck planned to dismember Meka's body,
drain his blood and eat his kidneys in a ritual she believed would
resurrect Jack the Ripper, the 19th century British serial killer.
   Meka testified Ms. Kazuck was chanting ``redrum'' _ or
``murder'' backwards _ when she lurched at him with the ax. The
blow, he said, opened a gash over his eye that required 50 stitches.
   Ms. Kazuck disputed those claims, but admitted she was
fascinated with Jack the Ripper, and regularly carried a backpack
containing a hatchet, a drill and knives.
   During the second phase of the trial, a defense psychiatrist
testified Ms. Kazuck suffered from a mental disease and could not
understand her acts were wrong. A state psychiatrist said she
suffered from a personality disorder, but could be held responsible
for the crime.

   Playwright August Wilson won his second Pulitzer
in four years on Thursday, and the author of ``The Piano Lesson''
said he's raring to go for a third.
   ``I was very surprised,'' said Wilson. ``I thought, `Wow. This
is No. 2.' It made me want to go right to my typewriter and start
another one.''
   Wilson's play won in the drama category. The Pulitzer for
fiction went to ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,'' Oscar
Hijuelos's novel about two Cuban brothers who find some fame in New
York's nightclubs.
   ``In Our Image: America's Empire in the Philippines,'' by
Stanley Karnow, won the award for history. ``And Their Children
After Them,'' by Dale Maharidge and Michael Williamson _ which
revisits the poor Alabamans who were profiled 50 years ago by James
Agee and Walker Evans in their classic book, ``Let Us Now Praise
Famous Men'' _ won for general non-fiction.
   ``The Piano Lesson'' _ the story of a sharecropper who wants to
buy the land his grandfather worked as a slave, and is willing to
sell the family piano to pay for it _ opens Monday on Broadway.
   It has played in regional theaters around the country for more
than a year, and had been a Pulitzer finalist in an early form last
year _ the first time a play has been a finalist for two
consecutive years. The version submitted for consideration this
year ``was significantly changed'' from the 1989 finalist, said
Pulitzer Administrator Robert Christopher.
   Wilson won the 1987 Pulitzer in drama for ``Fences.''
   All together, Columbia University awarded 14 prizes in
journalism and seven in the arts. Each award carried with it a
$3,000 prize, except the award for public service in journalism,
which is a gold medal.
   The other arts Pulitzers went to ``Machiavelli in Hell'' by
Sebastian de Grazia, for biography; ``The World Doesn't End,'' by
Charles Simic, for poetry; and ``Duplicates,'' a concerto for two
pianos and orchestra by Mel Powell, for music.
   The award for public service in journalism was given to two
newspapers that exposed health menaces _ the Washington (N.C.)
Daily News for an expose of carcinogens in the city water supply,
and The Philadelphia Inquirer for its probe of the blood industry.
   Reporting on a third health threat _ the link between the
dietary supplement L-tryptophan, and a rare blood disorder _ won
the Pulitzer for specialized reporting for Tamar Stieber of the
Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal. Ultimately, the supplement was recalled
nationally.
   Two San Francisco Bay area newspapers won Pulitzers for their
coverage of the northern California earthquake.
   The staff of the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News, which published
with the aid of emergency generators in the aftermath of last Oct.
17's quake, won the general news award for its coverage of the
disaster.
   The spot news photography award went to the photo staff of The
Tribune of Oakland, Calif., for pictures of the earthquake's
devastation.
   The award unleashed ``an earthquake of happiness,'' said Tribune
Publisher Robert Maynard.
   Other prizes honored coverage of the world's upheavals in 1989.
The award for international reporting went to Nicholas D. Kristof
and Sheryl WuDunn of The New York Times, a husband-and-wife team
that covered the mass movement for democracy in China and its
suppression.
   It was the Times' 61st Pulitzer, and ``a great victory for the
institution of marriage,'' said Allan M. Siegal, Times assistant
managing editor.
   David C. Turnley of the Detroit Free Press won the feature
photography prize for his coverage of political uprising in China
and Eastern Europe.
   Announcement of the awards set off celebrations around the
country.
   ``I will say we haven't had this much excitement in this town
since the Union cavalry and the Confederate cavalry chased each
other up Main Street in 1862, and there's been nothing like that
since,'' said Bill Coughlin, the Washington Daily News' executive
editor.
   The Daily News revealed that carcinogens had been in the water
supply for eight years, and that the local government had neither
disclosed the problem nor corrected it.
   They broke out the champagne at the Inquirer, which won for
reporter Gilbert M. Gaul's series. It was the Philadelphia
newspaper's 17th Pulitzer _ and the 11th in the past six years.
   ``I feel great. It is a terrific honor,'' said Gaul. ``The paper
showed an incredible amount of courage to allow me to spend a year
and a half on the story and to report on a subject that is of great
importance to everyone that we don't often think about _ blood.''
   Gaul, 38, had previously won the Pulitzer Prize for
investigative reporting in 1979. The blood series, which found that
the industry is little regulated, was inspired by his questions
about what happened to the blood he donated four times a year.
   It was the first time in 23 years that two newspapers were cited
in the public service category.
   The investigative reporting award went to Lou Kilzer and Chris
Ison of the Star Tribune of Minneapolis-St. Paul, for their
revelation of a network of local citizens who were linked to
members of the St. Paul fire department and who profited from fires.
   The explanatory journalism award went to David A. Vise and Steve
Coll of The Washington Post for stories examining the workings of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and its former chairman,
John Shad.
   Four reporters for The Seattle Times _ Ross Anderson, Bill
Dietrich, Mary Ann Gwinn and Eric Nalder _ received the national
reporting award for their coverage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill
and its aftermath.
   ``When we first heard we might have won I was on pins and
needles and sick to my stomach and everything, and now I'm just
covered with champagne and feeling great,'' said Nalder.
   For his feature writing award, Dave Curtin of the Colorado
Springs (Colo.) Gazette Telegraph profiled a family that was
struggling to recover from an explosion that devastated their home
and left them severely burned.
   Other awards included:
   _For commentary, sports columnist Jim Murray of the Los Angeles
Times.
   _For criticism, Allan Temko of the San Francisco Chronicle.
``Did I win?'' said the architecture critic. ``Is it true? How
extraordinary. I've always been a bridesmaid.''
   _For editorial writing, Thomas J. Hylton of The Mercury of
Pottstown, Pa., who wrote editorials about a local bond issue for
the preservation of farmland and other open space in rural
Pennsylvania.
   _For editorial cartooning, Tom Toles of The Buffalo (N.Y.) News.

   The environmental group Greenpeace on Thursday
accused a British company of contaminating drinking and bathing
water in South Africa's KwaZulu homeland by improperly reprocessing
mercury wastes.
   The company, Thor Chemical, denied it contaminated a river that
provides the drinking supply for the KwaZulu homeland or exposed
workers to poisonous fumes.
   Thor Chemical's mercury reclamation plant, the world's largest,
receives wastes from companies in the United States, Britain,
Italy, West Germany, France and Australia.
   Greenpeace said American Cyanamid Co. of Wayne, N.J., is one of
the largest users of the plant and has shipped nearly 10 tons of
toxic waste a year to the plant the past four years.
   There was no comment from American Cyanamid, which did not
return repeated telephone calls.
   In a statement released in London, Greenpeace said workers at
the plant are regularly exposed to mercury fumes and have suffered
a variety of mental disorders. Mercury attacks the central nervous
system and can cause brain damage.
   In a statement carried in the Greenpeace press release, the
South African environmental group Earthlife said black workers at
Thor Chemicals have been sent home from the plant after suffering
from bouts of ``madness'' associated with mercury poisoning.
   Bill Garrard, managing director of Thor Chemicals, was quoted as
telling the British newspaper the Guardian that workers are tested
weekly for contamination and are taken off the job if they show
high mercury levels.
   The Greenpeace statement also said sediment taken from the
nearby Umgeni River showed mercury levels of 1,000 parts per
million. Villagers in the government-designated homeland of KwaZulu
use the water for bathing, washing and drinking.
   ``This is an astonishing level of contamination, among the
highest ever recorded,'' Dr. Paul Johnston, an aquatic toxicologist
at Queen Mary College in London, was quoted as saying in the
Greenpeace statement.
   Johnston was quoted by the Guardian as saying the mercury
contamination was ``extensive and serious,'' and that levels were
hundreds of times above the World Health Organization's maximum
acceptable levels for drinking water.
   The KwaZulu homeland in the southeastern part of South Africa is
home to 7 million blacks. South Africa is the only nation that
recognizes the area as independent.
   Greenpeace said the toxic waste has been introduced into the
water supply when heavy rains carry contaminated soil into the
river.
   Chris Priestley, a spokesman for Thor Chemicals, accused
Greenpeace of ``sensationalism.'' He said if his company was
contaminating water, high mercury levels would also be present in
drinking water in Durban, about 50 miles downstream.
   Priestley said the high levels of mercury in the soil samples
was due to a form of gold mining called mercury leaching, used in a
nearby mine a few years ago.
   He said excess mercury seaped into the river from the abandoned
mine, and contaminated the nearby Zulu areas, but not Durban, which
is too far downstream for the contamination to affect.
   ``I have no evidence that leads me to believe that any
contamination that is arising is coming from Thor Chemicals itself.
We must now investigate and find out why this is happening,''
Priestley said.
   In the last two years, the growing trade in hazardous waste has
prompted a number of agreements on dumping in Africa. In December
1989, the European Community signed a waste trade ban with 68
African, Caribbean and Pacific states.
   In May 1988 and July 1989, the Organization of African Unity
adopted resolutions calling for a toxic waste import ban for Africa.
   South Africa is banned from membership in these groups due to
the government's practice of racial discrimination.

<TEXT>
   Former Sen. Lawton Chiles, one of
Florida's most popular politicians, came out of retirement Thursday
to enter the Democratic gubernatorial race.
   Chiles, who resigned from the Senate in January 1989 saying he
was ``burned out'' by big-money politics and the grind of the
federal bureaucracy, said he wanted to keep Florida from going down
the same path.
   His running mate will be former Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay.
   ``We're going to ask the people of Florida to walk with us, to
walk with us to try to make this state ... what they would like it
to be,'' said Chiles, who literally walked across the state in his
first successful senate campaign.
   The 60-year-old Chiles said he looked forward to a contest
against his Democratic opponents, Rep. Bill Nelson and state Sen.
George Stuart, who each said Thursday they were in the race to
stay. The primary is Sept. 4.
   ``I think George and Bill Nelson are excellent men,'' said
Chiles. ``I look forward to campaigning with them. I think we can
go out and talk about the issues.''
   Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, who is winding up a tumultous
first term in office, said Chiles' candidacy only boosts his
re-election bid.
   ``They have some difficulty figuring out how they're going to
beat me,'' said Martinez, who is expected to defeat his GOP
challengers. ``The tide is going against them. They just don't have
the leadership for the future.''
   Nelson, 47, who was considered the front-runner prior to Chiles'
candidacy, was already toughening his rhetoric.
   ``I can assure you that I'm not burned out. I'm ready to govern
this state,'' said Nelson. ``We Democrats lost an important U.S.
Senate seat two years ago when Lawton Chiles decided he was
suddenly burned out with public service. ... Which job is the more
mentally and physically and emotionally demanding, governor or U.S.
senator?''
   MacKay, a former three-term congressman, was beaten by
Republican Connie Mack for Chiles' seat.
   In 1970, Chiles was a little-known state legislator whose
populist campaign led to an upset Senate victory and endeared him
to many Floridians. He was re-elected by a landslide in 1976 and
1982 and became chairman of the influential Senate Budget Committee.
   After leaving the Senate, Chiles became director of the LeRoy
Collins Center for Public Policy, a think tank at Florida State
University in Tallahassee. He resigned that position late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Five Choose To Remain In Jail After Arrests For Violating Court
Order</HEAD>

   Five blacks protesting the ouster of the
city's first black school superintendent chose to remain in jail
Thursday, a day after police armed with a court order restricting
protests arrested seven people.
   ``They're free to go at any time,'' said Police Chief Melvin
Summerlin. ``They apparently don't want to leave.''
   Summerlin described the situation as quiet after protesters
rallied outside the jail Wednesday night in a show of support for
the seven people arrested earlier in the day.
   Two people did post bond and were released.
   The protests have continued since mid-December, when the
white-controlled school board refused to extend the contract of
Norward Roussell, the system's first black superintendent.
   The arrests came after Lauderdale County Circuit Judge Leslie
Johnson issued an order restricting demonstrators to the sidewalk
in front of City Hall. The order also prohibits demonstrators from
encouraging car drivers to honk horns, marching around the building
and holding picnics in the lobby.
   Four of the protesters were arrested outside City Hall at noon
Wednesday on charges of obstructing governmental operations for
setting up chairs on the sidewalk. Three others were arrested later
in the day after a scuffle involving three policemen outside a
restaurant. They were charged with disorderly conduct.
   Summerlin said he ordered the group outside City Hall to
disperse but was ignored.
   ``I gave them sufficient time, but it didn't appear as though
they planned to listen or abide by the court order,'' he said. ``We
had no choice but to make arrests.''
   The incident at the restaurant Wednesday apparently was sparked
when a driver was cited for blowing his horn about a block away
from City Hall.
   Police reports said the three who were arrested were to blame
for the skirmish, but a spectator, Eliza Manuel, said police chased
the three for no apparent reason.
   In addition to the arrests, several black motorists were given
tickets for blowing their car horns as they drove by City Hall,
which Mayor Joe Smitherman said were deliberate acts to test the
injunction.
   Among those arrested was lawyer Carlos Williams, 41. It was his
second arrest during protests against the the city's
white-controlled school board. In February, Williams and three
others were arrested when they tried to force their way into the
mayor's office during a protest.

<HEAD>Legislator: 70 Percent of State Economy Could Be Private by 1991</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior legislator said Thursday that up to 70
percent of the Soviet state economy could be turned over to private
hands in radical economic reforms likely to begin next year.
   But Pavel Bunich, deputy chairman of a Supreme Soviet committee
on economic reform, was unsure whether the government would be bold
enough to press that hard for such large-scale reforms.
   ``If we want to take small steps, we will get nowhere but to a
general collapse,'' Bunich told a news conference.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said earlier this week that he
will meet Saturday with his Presidential Council and the Council of
the Federation to hear the government's proposals for radical
economic changes.
   He said that reforms previously scheduled to take effect in
1992-93 _ in a plan presented by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov four
months ago _ should be moved up to this year and next.
   Bunich predicted that opponents of such radical reform _ a
fundamental change in the state-based Soviet economy _ will
complain loudly at the Supreme Soviet. But he said the reforms are
likely to be approved, permitting them to go into effect in 1991.
   ``If we are talking about de-nationalization, about 70 percent
of the public sector will cease to exist,'' Bunich said. ``There
are many people who want to buy shops, workshops and small
enterprises.''
   Such a shift would mean not only putting business in private
hands, but freeing up prices of goods produced and sold by the
private sector, Bunich said.
   It also would cut drastically into the work of government
ministries and the agencies that handle economic planning, pricing
and supply, he said.
   Bunich told reporters that he did not favor a Polish-style
``shock therapy'' approach to economic reform, including a sudden
freeing of prices, devaluation of the currency and rapid increases
in unemployment.
   Public opposition and danger of social upheavals ``is the main
danger we are facing here,'' he said.
   Instead, he said economists are looking at an approach closer to
Yugoslavia's, based on wage controls.
   That approach has cut the rate of inflation drastically in
Yugoslavia this year, he said. ``Prices are beginning to stabilize
in Yugoslavia. We are studying the Yugoslav option,'' he said.
   Asked whether Ryzhkov's government agrees on the need to return
the majority of the economy to private hands, Bunich said
government ministers have ``some exact formulas, but some of them
are so porous that it's just impossible to tell whether the
government agrees or not.''
   After Ryzhkov's government makes its proposals to Gorbachev, he
is likely to address the Supreme Soviet legislature at the end of
the month with a final blueprint of economic reform that will
require new laws and directives.

   More than 100 firefighters worked around
the clock Thursday battling a blaze that swept across about 1,000
acres of the dry, heather-covered moors of a national park.
   The fire threatens some of Britain's most valuable grouse moors
and one of the loveliest valleys in the North Yorkshire Dales, a
region known to the world from James Herriot's descriptions in
``All Creatures Great and Small.''
   Additional firefighters were called in late Thursday to
reinforce those who had been trying to contain the blaze that began
Wednesday.
   Firefighters and officials of Dales National Park urged people
to stay out of the area over the Easter holiday. They said they
were hoping for rain.
   The blaze, which firefighters believe was ignited by a discarded
burning cigarette, is being fanned by winds sweeping across the
countryside near Leyburn, northern England.
   The blaze comes at the height of the grouse-breeding season, and
grouse are fleeing the area and abandoning their eggs, which could
mean a shortage of the birds when hunting season opens in August.

   Former President Reagan accepted a
3-ton chunk of the Berlin Wall on Thursday, saying the ``unnatural,
ugly, unwelcome'' symbol will remind presidential library visitors
of communist oppression.
   ``It shattered dreams and crushed hopes,'' Reagan told more than
1,000 guests gathered at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library,
which is still under construction, to witness the unveiling of the
9{-foot tall, 3{-feet wide concrete slab.
   Moments after a white tarp was pulled away, revealing
1960s-style graffiti of a brilliantly-colored butterfly and flower
design, Reagan and his wife, Nancy, walked up to the wall and
touched it.
   Thirty-four months earlier, on June 12, 1987, the nation's 40th
president stood at the Berlin Wall's Brandenberg Gate and
challenged Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev: ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear
down this wall!''
   ``For more than 28 years, the Berlin Wall stood as an unnatural,
ugly, unwelcome, undeniable symbol of the oppression of
communism,'' Reagan told guests, mostly GOP faithful and
contributors to the $40 million library.
   ``It stood as a grim reminder of what happens when dictators
strip the people of their freedom,'' he said in a six-minute speech.
   On hand for the presentation were Leopold Siefker, the West
German consul general in Los Angeles, and Norbert Reemer, minister
counselor for the German Democratic Republic.
   The chunk to be installed in the library was supplied by the
Berlin Wall Commemorative Group, an East German organization.
   During the 38-minute ceremony the UCLA marching band played
tunes such as ``Surf City'' and ``Tequila,'' and the Bavarian Beer
Garden Band played accordion ditties.
   Guests included Lew Wasserman, the MCA Inc. chairman who was
Reagan's Hollywood agent during his movie days, former U.S.
Information Agency Charles Wick and fast food burger magnate Carl
Karcher. Mel Torme sang the national anthem.
   The 153,000-square-foot presidential library 40 miles northwest
of Los Angeles is carved into a Ventura County hilltop. The
concrete and steel superstructure overlooking green grass hills and
beyond to the Pacific Ocean is due for completion Feb. 6, Reagan's
80th birthday.

<TEXT>
   A New York-based Hasidic rabbi who has never
been to Israel emerged Thursday as a pivotal figure in deciding
whether Labor Party leader Shimon Peres will be the new prime
minister.
   A lawmaker of the Agudat Israel Party said the ultra-Orthodox
faction would appeal to Brooklyn-based Rabbi Menachem Schneerson to
change the minds of two Agudat members who at the last minute
backed out of the party's pledge to join a Labor-led coalition.
   The two legislators, Avraham Verdiger and Eliezer Mizrahi, cited
loyalty to Schneerson's teachings in explaining why they refused to
vote for Labor on Wednesday. This blocked Peres from forming a new
government.
   Schneerson is known as the Lubavitcher Rabbi and is revered by
hundreds of thousands of Hasidic Jews. He opposes Labor's proposal
to exchange parts of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for
peace with the Palestinians.
   He has written that the biblical land of Israel, which includes
the occupied territories, was given to the Israelis by God and must
never be surrendered.
   The involvement of Schneerson and other ultra-Orthodox religious
leaders in Israeli politics has caused concern among the country's
overwhelmingly secular public.
   ``The whole political situation depends on rabbis, not only the
Lubavitcher Rabbi, but also others,'' Moshe Shahal, a senior Labor
Party official, said on Israel radio.
   ``We are facing a new phenomenon ... the involvement of
ultra-Orthodox streams of Judaism which are taking part for the
first time in secular politics,'' Shahal said.
   Berke Wolff, a spokesman for Schneerson's Habad Movement in
Israel, denied the rabbi had persuaded the two lawmakers to defect.
But Israel army radio reported that at least one of the legislators
was instructed by Schneerson to refuse to vote for Peres' coalition.
   Agudat legislator Rabbi Menachem Porusch, who negotiated the
agreement with Labor, said Schneerson did not give direct
instructions to the two defectors to defy the party line.
   ``No doubt there is a misunderstanding here,'' he said. ``I'm
sure he (Schneerson) would not tell Verdiger and Mizrahi to go
against the wishes of the Council of Torah Sages.''
   The council's rabbis are the spiritual leaders of the Agudat
Israel party and had approved the party's coalition agreement with
Labor.
   Verdiger resigned from Parliament on Wednesday to avoid casting
a vote, and Mizrahi said he would create his own faction and vote
against Labor. With the defections, Labor's backing in the 120-seat
Parliament fell from 61 to 59. Prior to the changes the Agudat
party held five seats in parliament.
   In Brooklyn, a spokesmam for the Lubavitcher Hasidim, Rabbi
Yehuda Krinsky, said Verdiger called the Lubavitcher Rabbi's office
before the Passover holiday and asked if there had been any change
in Schneerson's opposition to the land-for-peace arrangement.
   He was told no, and decided on his own to oppose a Labor
government, Krinsky said.
   ``It was on his own, it was his own initiative,'' Krinsky said.
He said the Lubavitvcher movement has ``not been in any of the
political horse-trading that's going on.''
   Israel's previous Labor-Likud coalition government collapsed

<HEAD>Iowa Says FmHA and Elevator Operator Equally Responsible for
Cleanup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State environmental officials on
Thursday held a federal agency and a grain elevator operator
equally responsible for cleaning up 12,755 bushels of corn heavily
tainted by a natural cancer-causing toxin.
   The order from the Iowa Division of Environmental Protection
gave the Farmers Home Administration and the Pruess Elevator Co. of
Lowden, which purchased the corn, until next Friday to remove it.
   But a lawyer representing the FmHA, which sold the corn from a
foreclosed farm at Chouteau, Okla., and knew it was tainted,
insisted the agency has no responsibility. The owner of the
elevator, Harlan Pruess, continued to decline to comment Thursday.
   The grain is believed to have the highest concentration of
aflatoxin ever found in this country, as much as 1,600 times the
maximum allowable limit for human consumption, said Dale Cochran,
Iowa's secretary of agriculture. Regional officials of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration in Kansas City, Mo., also said the
aflatoxin level is the highest they've ever come across.
   Aflatoxins are cancer-causing and toxic substances produced by
certain soil fuingi.
   The Food and Drug Administration says aflatoxin concentrations
above 20 parts per billion are unsuitable for human consumption and
concentrations above 300 parts per billion are unsuitable for
animal feed.
   FDA tests of the corn found concentrations as high as 32,300
parts per billion in one sample. In its bill of sale, the FmHA
disclosed that the corn contained aflatoxin concentrations greater
than 5,000 parts per billion and assigned any liability to the
purchaser.
   ``It shouldn't be fed to anything,'' said Gary Osweiler, a
veterinary toxicologist at Iowa State University.
   An animal fed such tainted corn ``probably would become ill
within a day or so. You'd probably kill animals,'' he said.
   An FMhA lawyer declined to say why the agency had sold the
grain, except to say that the sale had not been banned by federal
or state authorities.
   Speedy action by the Iowa Department of Agriculture prevented
the corn from being fed to animals or winding up in milk or meat
products, state and federal officials said.
   Oklahoma officials notified counterparts in Iowa once tests
disclosed the aflatoxin concentrations in the early March shipment,
and Iowa inspectors were on hand to quarantine the corn when it
arrived.
   Dust from the tainted corn could be a health risk, but
fortunately the corn is covered with a protective crust, in part
because of the high moisture content that also enabled the fungi to
grow, said Allan Stokes, director of the environmental protection
division within Iowa's Department of Natural Resources.
   ``It's kind of like a scab. It's best not to pick on it till you
know what to do,'' Stokes said.
   The corn is quarantined, piled on a concrete slab, surrounded by
concrete retaining walls, next to the elevator in a sparsely
settled area three miles outside Lowden, in eastern Iowa, Stokes
said.
   Iowa environmental authorities set a deadline of April 20 for
implementing ``an acceptable plan to get the corn out of the state
or remove the threat from the corn,'' Stokes said.
   Stokes estimated the cleanup cost at around $100,000, while
Cochran has placed it as high as $1.5 million. The grain was sold
for $9,566.
   Robert Bird, an attorney in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
office of general counsel in Stillwater, Okla., represents the FmHA.
   ``I don't see how the state of Iowa could hold the FmHA
co-responsible because the FmHA has no ownership interest,'' Bird
said in a telephone interview.
   He said the FDA and the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture both
knew in advance of the intended sale and if either had ``told the
FmHA to destroy the corn the FmHA would do it.''
   But he said aside from informing the FmHA of the maximum
allowable limits of aflatoxin in animal feed or for human
consumption, there was no directive banning the sale.

<HEAD>Group Says It Will Unify Soviet Greens into a Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group closely tied to the Communist Party and
the Soviet government has organized an environmental movement and
plans to transform it into a political party in the fall, members
announced Thursday.
   Non-Communist political parties were legalized last month.
   There are many local environmental, or Greens, movements in the
country, including one in Leningrad that has already registered as
a political party.
   The new group, called the ``Movement for the Restoration of the
Environment and Morality,'' says it will try to unite them into a
single political force. The more radical environmentalists,
however, may be unwilling to affiliate with such an established
group.
   The Soviet Union is severely polluted as a result of years when
any questioning of official stands, including environmental
activism, could bring a prison sentence.
   Three officials of the new movement said it is affiliated with a
group of 50 Soviet state-owned enterprises and scientific
institutes that are developing environmentally sound technologies.
   All three men said they were Communist Party members, and the
movement is modeled on the party. The organization's founding was
announced in a news conference at the Foreign Ministry, giving it
an official air.
   The group's director, Soviet legislator Alim I. Chabanov, said
the movement will have its own newspaper and broadcast programs. He
said it will propose anti-pollution legislation and government
funding for non-polluting equipment.

<HEAD>China Condemns U.S. Order to Protect Chinese Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China on Thursday denounced an order by President
Bush to protect Chinese students in the United States from being
deported.
   Bush's executive order, issued Wednesday, is designed to help
the students avoid reprisals for supporting the pro-democracy
movement crushed by Chinese forces in June.
   The Chinese also criticized Britain on Thursday for its plan to
offer citizenship to Hong Kong residents. It reiterated that it
considers all Chinese in the British colony to be citizens of China.
   China is to take over control of Hong Kong in 1997, but it has
pledged to allow the capitalist system to remain there for 50 years
and permit local autonomy.
   However, about 1,000 Hong Kong residents are emigrating each
week, including many of the territory's best-educated people.
   Bush's order Wednesday followed his veto of a congressional act
with the same goals in November. He said at the time he would
instead issue an executive order.
   However, he initially put out a directive containing guidelines
for immigration officials _ rather than an executive order. The
action brought a rash of published reports and congressional
criticism.
   ``At the end of last year, the Chinese government made clear its
principal position on the administrative measures announced by the
U.S. government,'' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said at a
weekly news briefing Thursday. ``The position of the Chinese side
on this issue is consistent and unequivocal.''
   In criticizing the U.S. plan last year, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said, ``The sending of Chinese personnel abroad, their
management, and assignment upon return are all China's internal
affairs in which no foreign government or parliament has the right
to interfere.''
   He added, ``The allegation that Chinese personnel studying
abroad might be persecuted upon their return to China is utterly
groundless.''
   Bush's order Wednesday allows Chinese students to remain in the
United States until Jan. 1, 1994, even if their visas expire.
   In the complaints about the British proposal, Ms. Li said, ``The
Chinese government has time and again made clear its solemn stand
against the unilateral decision of Britain to change the
nationality of some of the Hong Kong Chinese citizens.''
   Britain plans to give passports to 50,000 Hong Kong residents to
prevent a crippling brain drain in the territory before it reverts
to Chinese rule. British officials hope the guarantee of
citizenship will keep those residents in the colony for now.
   The measure was introduced in the House of Commons on Wednesday.
However, it faces stiff opposition from opponents of mass
immigration.

   Pulitzer Prize winners and their co-workers
whooped it up, sprayed each other with champagne and cheered
Thursday from Washington, N.C., to Oakland, Calif.
   ``I will say we haven't had this much excitement in this town
since the Union cavalry and the Confederate cavalry chased each
other up Main Street in 1862, and there's been nothing like that
since,'' said Bill Coughlin, executive editor of the Washington
Daily News, which has a circulation of 10,700.
   The Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer won Pulitzers for
public service journalism; the Inquirer won for reporting on the
blood industry, and the Daily News for revealing that the city
water supply was contaminated with carcinogens.
   ``We've got a great team here _ a real bunch of pros operating
at this level,'' said Coughlin, covered with champagne and speaking
over shouts and marching music.
   ``All through covering the story, there was a great deal of
pressure,'' said reporter Betty Gray. ``I'm a native of Washington.
I grew up with the people that were running the city.''
   Gray and Mike Voss reported the story. ``I'm ecstatic,'' Voss
said. ``This is a dream come true. ... For a small town newspaper
to compete and take home the biggest and the best is unbelievable.''
   The Inquirer's public service prize marked the sixth straight
year the newspaper has won a Pulitzer. Champagne is a tradition
there: the paper has won 17 Pulitzers in 16 years.
   Gilbert Gaul wrote the prize-winning series on the blood
industry. In 1979, Gaul and Elliot Jaspen won a Pulitzer for
investigative reporting at the Pottsville (Pa.) Republican.
   Family was a big part of the Pulitzer picture for Nicholas D.
Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn of The New York Times, who won the
international reporting prize for covering political turmoil in
China. They were married shortly before going overseas in March
1989.
   ``I can't think of any journalists who did a more superb job
during those incredible days in China last year,'' said Bernard
Gwertzman, the Times' foreign editor.
   ``This is a great victory for the institution of marriage,''
said Allan M. Siegal, Times assistant managing editor.
   Jim Murray, 70, widely respected sports columnist for the Los
Angeles Times, won the prize for commentary.
   ``All the years I was in the business, I always thought
Pulitzers were for overturning a government or exposing a scandal
in the stock market,'' Murray said. ``I thought Walter Lippmann got
Pulitzers, not us guys.''
   Allan Temko of the San Francisco Chronicle, the criticism
winner, was hauled away by applauding co-workers for a celebration.
``Did I win?'' he said. ``Is it true? How extraordinary. I've
always been a bridesmaid.''
   ``When we first heard we might have won I was on pins and
needles and sick to my stomach and everything, and now I'm just
covered with champagne and feeling great,'' said Eric Nalder, one
of four reporters at The Seattle Times who won for national
reporting.
   ``I'm literally speechless,'' said Tamar Stieber, 34, of the
Albuquerque Journal, who won for specialized reporting for her
reports linking the dietary supplement L-tryptophan to a rare blood
disorder.
   ``It's wonderful of course _ kind of like a lifelong dream,''
said Dave Curtin, 34, winning feature writer, at the Colorado
Springs Gazette Telegraph. Curtin wrote about a family's struggle
to recover after its members were severely burned in an explosion
that leveled the family home.
   Red, white and green balloons went up in The Washington Post
newsroom. The explanatory journalism prize went to the Post's David
A. Vise and Steve Coll, who scrutinized the Securities and Exchange
Commission and its former chairman, John Shad.
   ``I think it's a terrific honor,'' said Vise. ``It's a proud day
for me and my family and my partner, Steve Coll, who is in New
Delhi, India; for the business section of The Washington Post, and
for the newspaper.''
   An elated, cheering staff at The Tribune of Oakland, Calif.,
which won the spot news photos category, spritzed newspaper
executives and editors with champagne.
   ``The work of this staff prevailed over all of the other entries
because of its incredible clarity, the intensity, the closeness to
the action, the way our staff really got in close, and the
compassion for the victims _ that too came through,'' said Robert
Maynard, publisher.
   In Pottstown, about 30 miles northwest of Philadelphia,
editorial writer Thomas J. Hylton was returning from the drug store
to The Mercury office when he got the news.
   ``I'm kind of in shock,'' he said after getting a hug from
editor and publisher Joe Zlomek and a round of applause from the
staff of the morning newspaper with a circulation of 30,000.
   Hylton, 41, earned the prize for his editorials about a bond
issue to preserve farmland and open space in Chester County, where
suburban development is quickly changing its rural character.
   David C. Turnley's images of world upheavals won him a
photography prize. The winning portfolio by the Paris-based
photographer for the Detroit Free Press _ ``The Year in
Revolution'' _ contained eight pictures from China, two from the
Berlin Wall, two from Czechoslovakia and eight from Romania.
   Turnley, 34, got the word in Johannesburg, South Africa, in a
conference call his editors set up, supposedly to talk about
pending assignments.
   Not everyone was surprised.
   ``Everybody has been saying every year, `You're going to win,'
'' Tom Toles, 38, the winning cartoonist, told colleagues who
poured into his cubicle adjoining The Buffalo (N.Y.) News newsroom.
   ``All I can say is I really wanted to win it in Buffalo and now
I have,'' said Toles. ``Buffalo has had its hard times and I have a
special feeling for the city.''
   ``I can't say it was unexpected. Everybody who saw our coverage
from the outside and the inside said it was extraordinary,'' said
Executive Editor Robert Ingle of the San Jose Mercury News, winner
for general news reporting.
   In Minneapolis, Executive Editor Joel Kramer of the Star Tribune
of Minneapolis-St. Paul, which won the investigative award, told a
newsroom crowd that the story, ``Fire in St. Paul,'' resulted from
``old-fashioned gumshoe reporting.''
   Then, after a 1{-hour celebration, Kramer announced: ``This
party's almost over. We've got to put a paper out tomorrow.''
   And not everyone breathlessly awaited the news.
   ``I had no idea it was even being announced this week,'' Oscar
Hijuelos said in a telephone interview in New York. His book, ``The
Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,'' won the Pulitzer for fiction.
   Poetry winner Charles Simic was in Delaware on a reading tour
when his wife called.
   ``I always hate to get these calls from my wife,'' he said. ``I
always think something happened, like the car got wrecked or the
basement is overflooded. But I could hear by her voice there was
something special, and she told me right away. It astonished me.''
   Two-time Pulitzer winner August Wilson, whose ``The Piano
Lesson'' earned him the drama award, was in a hotel coffee shop
when he got the news:
   ``I thought, `Wow, this is No. 2.' It made me want to go right
to my typewriter and start another one.''

   Three-time Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr.
agreed Thursday to plead guilty to extorting $573,000 from a coal
company, as well as mail fraud, tax fraud and obstruction of
justice, a prosecutor said.
   The former Republican governor could be sentenced to 36 years in
prison and fined $1.2 million, U.S. Attorney Michael Carey said in
announcing the plea agreement and a five-count indictment at a news
conference.
   By signing the agreement, Moore admitted committing illegal acts
in his 1984 campaign, his term as governor from 1984 to 1988, and
his 1988 re-election campaign.
   ``It's tragic for the state of West Virginia that an official of
this stature was involved,'' Carey said.
   ``This news will be greeted with a great joy by some in the
state of West Virginia,'' Moore said in a statement. ``There will
be others who will be sincerely grieved by reason of their devotion
to me and my family. I know I have their understanding and love.
For that, I shall be ever grateful.''
   Moore's Democratic successor, Gov. Gaston Caperton, said he
hoped West Virginians now realize that he inherited a government
that was morally bankrupt as well as financially. ``The back-room,
slipshod politics of the past must forever remain in the past,'' he
said.
   It was the second time Moore was indicted for alleged
improprieties in office. He and his 1972 campaign manager were
indicted in December 1975 on a charge of extorting $25,000 from the
president of a shaky financial holding company trying to get a
state charter for a new bank. He was acquitted in 1976.
   Moore is the latest West Virginia politician in recent years to
either become involved in a corruption scandal or resign. Since
December 1988, a state attorney general, a state treasurer, two
state Senate presidents, a Senate majority leader, a top aide to a
Senate president, a House member and two lobbyists have lost their
jobs.
   Under the plea arrangement, Moore agreed to help federal
prosecutors in their investigation of political corruption in West
Virginia. Carey declined to provide specific cases for which Moore
would provide information.
   The U.S. attorney said his office would make no recommendation
to the federal judge who sentences Moore. He said, however, the
judge would be given details of other crimes Moore allegedly
committed that are not included in Thursday's indictment.
   Moore is accused of blocking a federal grand jury's
investigation of him last year and this year, Carey said.
   The obstruction of justice charges allege he falsified documents
and tried to persuade witnesses to commit perjury, Carey said. He
also lied in an interview with federal investigators, the
indictment alleged.
   In early January 1990, Moore met with former aide John Leaberry,
who was Moore's 1988 campaign manager, the indictment said.
   ``Unknown to Moore, his meeting with Leaberry was recorded,''
the indictment said. ``In the meeting, Moore discussed the fact
that he had received and used illegal cash in the 1988 campaign and
then told Leaberry how they would both falsely deny to
investigators and to the grand jury that there had been any such
cash in the campaign.''
   The indictment also alleged Moore used his office to extort
approximately $573,000 in 1985 from H. Paul Kizer and Maben Energy
Corp., a coal mining and processing company, Carey said.
   Moore agreed to assist Kizer and Maben Energy with receiving a
refund of more than $2 million from the state's black lung fund,
which provides benefits to coal miners with the respiratory
disease, the indictment said.
   In return, Moore received about 25 percent of that refund, it
said. The indictment said Kizer was responsible for a Maben Energy
check being mailed to an unidentified attorney, who took $50,000 as
his share and sent the remainder to Moore. Carey declined to
identify the lawyer involved.
   Kizer is cooperating with federal prosecutors, said his
attorney, James Lees.
   The indictment said Moore created fake, backdated documents
purporting to be legitimate ``contingent fee'' legal agreements to
cover up the extortion.
   The indictment also accused Moore of filing false income tax
returns in 1984 and 1985, Carey said. It said he failed to report
$40,000 in income in 1984 and $105,000 in 1985.
   Moore also was charged with scheming to defraud the state of his
salary and benefits by funneling approximately $100,000 in cash
into his 1984 campaign fund, Carey said.
   Carey said he did not know when Moore would be arraigned, but
said it probably would be within 10 to 14 days.
   Moore, whose 67th birthday is Monday, was the first West
Virginia governor elected to two four-year terms and the first
elected to three, serving from 1969 to 1977 and from 1985 to 1989.
   Moore survived three decades of West Virginia's rough-and-tumble
politics despite a 2-to-1 registration edge for the Democrats and
almost constant controversy.
   He served one term in the state House of Delegates from 1953 to
1954 and was elected to Congress in 1956. At 33, Moore was the
youngest freshman in the 85th Congress and represented the state's
Northern Panhandle for six terms.
   In 1968, Moore gave up his House seat to run for governor. He
was prevented from seeking a third consecutive term by a provision
of the state Constitution and was succeeded by Democrat Jay
Rockefeller in January 1977.
   Moore was dogged by controversy even out of office.
   In August 1979, his former state liquor commissioner, J. Richard
Barber, was convicted of racketeering, extortion and mail fraud
involving charges that Barber received cash and free liquor from
distillers. The trial included testimony that some of the cash was
used for campaign contributions, and some of the liquor was passed
on to the governor's office. Barber was sentenced to three years in
prison.
   Moore won the governorship for the third time in 1984. However,
in that term Moore presided over a state government in extreme
financial difficulty, unable to pay its bills and forced to borrow
heavily.
   His tenure ended in dramatic defeat when Democratic newcomer
Gaston Caperton routed him in the 1988 election.

   About 200 members of a stagehands' union local
went on strike against CBS on Thursday after ``last-ditch''
contract talks ended in failure, a union spokeswoman said.
   The strike by members of Local One of the International Alliance
of Theatrical and Stage Employees is only against CBS' New York
facilities. The network's Los Angeles studios have separate
contracts with the union.
   The walkout, called after negotiations broke down Wednesday, was
the first against CBS since about 300 Writers Guild members struck
CBS News for seven weeks in 1987.
   Members of the union had been working without a contract since
Dec. 31, said union spokeswoman Deborah Friedman. She said the
strike also was against CBS-owned WCBS-TV here.
   ``We don't expect that it's going to affect our day-to-day
operations,'' said CBS spokeswoman Ann Morfogen. ``There are
contingency plans that can be put into effect as necessary.''
   No new talks with the union are scheduled, she said.

   Israel welcomed East Germany's apology Thursday
for the atrocities of the Holocaust, but one senior official, a
survivor of the Nazi camps, said he could never grant forgiveness
for the murder of 6 million Jews.
   The declaration by East Germany's first freely elected
Parliament marked the first time the country formally accepted
responsibility for Nazi crimes against Jews and said it was
prepared to pay reparations to victims.
   Israeli officials said the declaration could ease the way toward
establishing ties between the two countries.
   But Parliament Speaker Dov Shilansky, a survivor of the Dachau
concentration camp, said he would never forgive the killing of 6
million Jews during World War II.
   ``I, who have been there and have seen with my own eyes what
happened there, say that even in a thousand years, the shame of
Germany will not be erased,'' Shilansky told The Associated Press.
   Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
said that ``at first glance, it looks like a positive
announcement.''
   Asked to decribe the view of the Polish-born Shamir, who lost
most of his family in the Holocaust, Ahimeir said: ``The prime
minister knows to put a line between the past and the future, even
though the memories are very strong at the bottom of his heart.''
   East Germany's hard-line Communist rulers, whose 40-year-rule
was ended last fall in a popular revolt, refused to accept
responsibility for the Holocaust, arguing that they themselves were
persecuted by the Nazis.
   West Germany apologized many years ago for Nazi atrocities and
has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in reparations to Jewish
victims.
   Parliament also suggested East Germany was willing to pay
reparations, saying it would ``do everything in its power to
contribute to the healing of emotional and physical suffering of
the survivors, and to fight for a just compensation for material
losses.''

   President Bush, with his wife Barbara and
daughter Dorothy LeBlond went to the theater Thursday night to see
a new comedy about three widows.
   The nearly full house at the Kennedy Center for ``The Cemetery
Club'' by Ivan Menchell gave Bush a standing ovation before the
curtain went up as he waved from his seat and shook hands with a
couple in a box adjacent to his center presidential box.
   The play, starring Eileen Heckart, Elizabeth Franz and Doris
Belack, is about three women who get together monthly to visit the

ingeniously from a living room to a cemetery and back again in a

   One line might appeal to grandmothers, including Mrs. Bush, on
pointers for grandparents: ``You don't need any. You just sit back
and enjoy them and watch them do to your children what your
children did to you.''
   With the president were his campaign press secretary, Shiela
Tate, and her husband Bill; Transportation Department official
Julie Andrews; Susy Peake, who worked for Bush when he was vice
president and Greg Petersmeyer, head of the Office of National
Service and Points of Light.

   Exiled King Michael of Romania was barred from
returning to his homeland Thursday when the Romanian government
canceled his visa and said the monarch's first visit in 43 years
might promote unrest.
   The 68-year-old ex-king told an airport news conference in
Zurich, Switzerland, his visit would have been ``strictly private.''
   ``I don't understand the decision to rescind the visas. I don't
know what concerns there could have been,'' he declared. He was to
have been accompanied by his wife, Queen Anne, and his eldest
daughter, Princess Margarita. Their visas were also rescinded.
   Romania's provisional, post-revolutionary government had
appealed to Michael to postpone his visit until after May 20
elections to prevent possible disturbances.
   In Bucharest, several hundred Romanians who had gathered to
welcome the ex-king broke into chants of ``Shame, shame!'' and
``Down with the Communists!'' when they heard he was not coming.
   The king was booked on a Swissair flight from Zurich to
Bucharest Thursday at noon, but the airline management decided not
to let him board the plane. He learned of the cancellation of the
visas only after leaving his home near Geneva.
   In an interview with France's state-run Antenne 2 television
channel Thursday, Romanian Prime Minister Petre Roman said Michael
had planned to attend a demonstration in the western city of
Timisoara, where the December revolution began. He said the visit
would have been covered by about 80 journalists flown in especially
by chartered plane.
   ``Thus it was not at all a private visit, which we would not
have objected to, but a visit of a political character which was
opposed by practically all political factions and by public
opinion,'' Roman said.
   Silviu Brucan, chief ideologue of the National Salvation Front,
the dominant power in Romania's provisional government, called the
visit ``a very controversial political issue.''
   ``We are striving to calm down public opinion,'' Brucan said,
referring to the ethnic violence in Transylvania last month that
left at least six people dead.
   On Wednesday, the Bucharest government warned in a statement
that ``there is the possibility of some violent manifestations'' if
the visit took place.
   It said Michael's visit before the elections could ``exacerbate
existing conflicts, while also endangering his personal security.''
   When asked at the airport to speculate on Bucharest's motives,
Michael said he had ``no idea at this moment.'' But he said he was
still planning a visit ``as soon as possible.''
   In Romania, Princess Helen, one of Michael's five daughters,
said ``no words can express the sorrow of my father'' at being
barred from Romania during Easter celebrations. She and her sister
Sophie arrived in the country a few days ago with aid shipments.
   Michael's other daughters _ Margarita, Anne and Marie _ live in
exile.
   Michael was forced to abdicate by a Soviet-installed government
Dec. 30, 1947. He had intended to stay no longer than 10 days in
Romania.
   Michael, who has been living near Geneva for the past 30 years,
denounced his abdication shortly after he arrived in exile, saying
he signed the act after being told a refusal would set off a
massacre of his supporters.
   After the overthrow of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in
December, Michael said he was prepared to return to Romania as head
of a constitutional monarchy. But he indicated that this would have
to be subject to a referendum.

   Street violence over the fatal shooting of
a black teen-ager by a white policeman strained racial relations
Thursday in this tightly knit suburb, which has prided itself on
racial harmony for decades.
   Teen-agers, mostly blacks, roamed city streets after a night of
smashing windows and overturning cars. The Wednesday night violence
broke out after a peaceful candlelight protest over Tuesday's death
of 15-year-old Phillip Pannell of River Edge.
   The crowd of about 1,000 protesters called for a special
prosecutor to investigate the shooting.
   Gov. Jim Florio asked for calm, but said he saw no reason to
appoint a special prosecutor because the county prosecutor is a
deputy attorney general. Florio also said he would not put the
National Guard on alert.
   ``I am being kept informed of events there, and I will await
further investigation before determining what other action by state
officials may be required,'' he said at a Statehouse news
conference in Trenton.
   City police Chief Bryan Burke held a news conference outside
police headquarters and warned against further violence.
   ``It's stopped as far as I'm concerned,'' Burke said. ``We're
not going to tolerate any more unlawfulness. There will be
arrests.''
   The chief promised a large contingent of local, county and state
police would remain in the New York City suburb for about a week.
   He declined to estimate property damage from Wednesday night's
violence but said six police cars were destroyed. Many store
windows were shattered.
   Witnesses said police pushed the protesters into the parking lot
of police headquarters and some women and children were trampled.
The crowd retaliated by turning over cars, and throwing rocks and
other debris through the windows of the municipal building.
   Four police officers and at least three civilians were injured.
None of the injuries appeared serious.
   An attorney for the boy's family, Franklin Wilks, said he had
notified the borough, county and state that a lawsuit was planned.
   Pannell's mother, Thelma Pannell, told a news conference
Thursday that the lawsuit would help keep the case open.
   ``They can kill all the black kids until people realize that it
could be their sons who get killed,'' Ms. Pannell said. ``It's not
going to stop here. My son will not die like this, shot in the
back.''
   Others, however, both black and white, readily spoke about the
predominantly positive racial relations in this town of 37,000
people eight miles from New York.
   State Sen. Matthew Feldman, a former mayor, said this community
has prided itself on its ability for people of all races to live in
harmony.
   ``This is the first town in America to integrate, and we did it
ourselves, not by order of the Supreme Court,'' Feldman said,
referring to the city's voluntary integration of its schools in the
1960s.
   On April 1, the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People and the B'nai B'rith honored Feldman, who is white,
and Municipal Judge Isaac McNatt, who is black, for their efforts
in achieving racial harmony between Jews and blacks in Teaneck.
   But people also talked about the shooting, and some said it had
been preceded by ill will between the police department and black
men in town.
   The Rev. Glenn Wilson, pastor of Calvary Baptist Church and a
speaker at the vigil Wednesday, said that he and other blacks often
are pulled over by police.
   ``It may not be Camelot, but there is a nice climate here,'' he
said. ``Unfortunately the problem is between the black community
and the police. They stop blacks on a routine basis. Certain police
officers single out youths for selective law enforcement.''
   ``Things won't go back to normal, not until the cop goes on
trial for murder,'' said Maurice Jones, 17, a black Teaneck High
School student.
   Adults on both sides of racial lines in this town, where 64
percent of the residents are white and 24 percent are black, talked
about Pannell's shooting.
   ``It's not black against white. It's a matter of a policeman who
made a terrible mistake. We need to put a cap on this right now,''
said resident Robert Robinson, who is black.
   Officer Gary Spath, 29, who fired the fatal shot, reported to
the prosecutor's office to answer questions on the shooting of
Pannell, who died from a single gunshot in the back. Spath was
suspended with pay, and his gun was impounded as evidence,
officials said.
   Burke said Spath was responding to an anonymous telephone tip
that a teen-ager had drawn a gun on another youth.
   Acting Bergen County Prosecutor John Holl said police told him a
gun was found on the youth's body, a contention that some of
Pannell's friends denied.
   Spath last month received his fifth commendation from the
Teaneck Policeman's Benevolent Association since he joined the
department in 1982.
   Mayor Frank Hall, a white who has been on borough council for 24
years and said he was involved in the 1960s integration of the
schools, said the violence may have been caused by ``outside
agitators'' who wore red hats or scarves and broke away from
Wednesday's vigil.
   ``There were many cars with New York plates. You could say they
came to help their brothers. And that's fine, but they don't have a
stake in Teaneck like we do,'' Hall said.

   The Bush administration is preparing a
proposal to ease restrictions on sales of high-technology items to
the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe, but the changes likely
will not go far enough to satisfy Western allies.
   Commerce Undersecretary Dennis Kloske, who supervises export
control activities, said Wednesday there was growing agreement in
the administration over the actions needed to provide Western
technology to the struggling economies of Poland, Hungary and other
former communist bloc countries.
   The administration is conducting a review, and recommendations
on what changes can be made without jeopardizing national security
should be presented to President Bush by the end of this month,
Kloske said.
   ``There is an emerging consensus inside the administration that
the changing developments in Eastern Europe will allow for a
significant level of streamlining'' of export controls, Kloske told
business executives attending a U.S. Chamber of Commerce trade
seminar.

   British news reports today linked a murdered
American ballistics expert with an alleged plot by Iraq to
construct a huge gun capable of firing nuclear or chemical shells
hundreds of miles.
   Eight crates awaiting shipment to Iraq when they were seized by
customs agents at the northeast English port of Middlesbrough
included what were believed to be parts for a 131-foot gun barrel,
the British news agency Press Association said. This would be the
largest gun barrel ever made.
   A spokesman for Britain's Customs and Excise Department said
Wednesday: ``Last night we intercepted a consignment of goods being
loaded upon a ship that was destined for Iraq, a ship that had been
chartered by the Iraqi Maritime Services. The goods appear to be of
a military nature.''
   Iraq denied this. The official Iraqi news agency said the
consignment was steel pipes for a petrochemical project.

   Doctors' decisions to give tests or take X-rays
depend in part on how much money they make on them, a study today
says.
   The research supports the widely held but hard to document idea
that doctors' own financial interests play a role in determining
the kind and amount of care they give their patients.
   ``As in most professions, money matters,'' said David Hemenway,
a Harvard School of Public Health economist who directed the study.
   The report, in today's New England Journal of Medicine, measured
what happened when a chain of walk-in clinics changed the way it
paid its doctors. Instead of a flat hourly wage, doctors could earn
a percentage of all the fees they generated.
   With this financial incentive, they boosted the number of tests
and X-rays they performed by about 20 percent.
   The study was conducted in 1984 and 1985 at Boston-area offices
of Health Stop, the nation's biggest chain of walk-in clinics with
80 centers in six states.

   An experimental AIDS drug injected into two
pregnant monkeys reached their fetuses, raising hope that it might
block AIDS virus infection of human babies by their mothers,
scientists said today.
   If used early enough in pregnancy, it might ward off perinatal
AIDS infection, said study co-author Daniel Capon of Genentech Inc.
of South San Francisco.
   The drug reached the fetuses about as easily as a human mother's
natural proteins do as they build up disease resistance within
babies, researchers said.
   The drug, called a CD4 immunoadhesin, has shown promise against
the AIDS virus in the test tube, but its effectiveness in people is
not yet known.

   With the pomp and circumstance usually
reserved for state funerals, the rich and famous joined in paying
final respects to Ryan White, who fought prejudice against AIDS
sufferers during his long battle with the disease.
   The funeral, attended by 1,500 people and broadcast live on CNN,
showed how the articulate, poised 18-year-old had touched the
nation's heart with his pleas for understanding.
   First lady Barbara Bush led the ceremony, also attended by pop
stars Michael Jackson and Elton John.
   The Rev. Raymond Probasco encouraged the mourners to continue to
seek a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``With God's help, and each of yours, we'll make AIDS a disease
and not a dirty word,'' said Probasco, pastor at Center Chapel
United Methodist Church in Muncie.

<HEAD>NBC's Folksy ``Down Home'' Has Goshdurn Lame Scripts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a rule, any sitcom that needs more than two
executive producers tends to be lame. NBC's new ``Down Home'' has
three, including ``Cheers'' star Ted Danson.
   On the bright side, it's not about teen-age mutant ninja
turtles. That should count for something.
   Premiering Saturday after what NBC called a ``special preview''
on Thursday, ``Down Home'' stars Judith Ivey, a fine Broadway
actress who has Tony awards for her work in ``Steaming'' and
``Hurlyburly.''
   But here, she seems like a fish out of water. This is not good,
since ``Down Home'' is set in a Texas seacoast fishing village.
   Thursday's preview established that she plays Kate McCrorey, a
successful New York management consultant who returns home on
vacation to the little village to find her dad's cafe and bait shop
business failing.
   Worse, a developer represented by her old boyfriend (Ray Baker)
of 15 years ago wants to demolish the village and turn it into one
of those resorts that have hotels, time-share condos, minimalls and
probably cable TV.
   Well, by neddies, she decides to forgo Fun City and her career
there and help her daddy (Dakin Matthews) fight what passes for
progress.
   That's pretty much it, although it took a while for her to reach
that decision, not to mention be kissed by and fight with her old
flambee.
   In between, the preview presented the other regulars, among them
her hulking brother (Eric Allen Kramer) and a young, optimistic
Vietnamese refugee (Gedde Watanabe), the cook and dishwasher at the
cafe.
   Although strained, Thursday's premiere did have a few good
moments, the first when the town's laconic mayor, a fisherman,
drifted into the cafe and was greeted with a jovial, ``How the fish
treatin' you?''
   His off-hand reply: ``Aw, better than the missus. They ain't
bitin'.''
   (It should be noted that Tim Scott is a standout in his deadpan
mayoral role. He seems a keen student of good ol' boy Texas ways,
even to the point of wearing a faded Vietnam-era Marine camouflage
jacket in one scene.)
   But Saturday's premiere, about fishing, football and daring to
dream, is so thin on plot and dialogue it wouldn't even get a
coveted Emmy award for Best Lame Episode of a Comedy Series With
Three Executive Producers.
   Ivey gives both episodes her best shot. But she often seems to
be pressing, as if hoping her vitality will hide the fact that the
scripts basically are a case of nobody home.
   Incidental note: The closing credits of Thursday's preview had
10 people listed as ``assistants.'' In Saturday's show, the number
rises to 12.
   If it goes up to 14 assistants next time, we're asking Geraldo
Rivera to fly to Hollywood and see what gives.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   TUNE-IN TIME: If you get cable's Home Box Office, don't miss
Carly Simon's ``Carly in Concert: My Romance'' on Sunday. It's a
classy show, the fine old romantic kind of concert that even has a
string orchestra. Generous in sharing the spotlight with visitor
Harry Connick Jr., whom she puckishly describes as ``at 22, the
grand old man of standards,'' Simon gives lovely readings to a good
collection of standards, among ``My Funny Valentine'' and ``By
Myself.'' She also includes a few Simon standards, of course, and
does a wonderful, exuberant bossa nova version of ``We Have No
Secrets.''
   If you miss Sunday's show, not to worry. It'll be rerun five
more times. If you're not among the 17.3 million cable viewers who
pay extra for HBO, get her new ``My Romance'' album. It features
many of the same songs and the same tasty Marty Paich string
arrangements.
   THE THRILL OF VICTORY, THE AGONY OF THIRD: This TV season ends
Sunday, and while this week's Nielsens for prime time won't be
available until Tuesday, ratings analysts say NBC easily will win
its fifth consecutive season and that ABC will be No. 2 again. CBS,
which once led the pack, will be third for the third consecutive
season. That's costly, both in image and advertising revenue.

<HEAD>Galway Embarks on Another Musical Adventure</HEAD>

   James Galway loves to travel with his
audiences on musical adventures that make different tunes dance
from his flute.
   He plays Beethoven with a smile, and Irish ballads with The
Chieftains. Last year he toured with 30 children and the Baltimore
Symphony as the ``Pied Piper of Hamelin'' in a musical fantasy
written especially for him by composer John Corigliano.
   Now he's coming out with a new LP ``The Enchanted Forest.''
Galway teamed up with a roomful of synthesizers to make the album,
and then topped it off with an MTV video.
   But Galway doesn't know how to describe the new work, because he
dislikes labels.
   ``So don't call it new wave,'' he said. ``Just call it a unique
type of which there is no other like it.''
   Galway loves music and his temper can flare up at anyone or
anything that tries to complicate it. Even the contracts he must
sign for all of his ventures must be straightforward. ``We have a
rule in our office. If we can't read it. We don't sign it,'' he
says.
   Last year he turned 50, and Classical magazine calls this period
``the golden days of Galway'' as the flutist allows himself to pick
and choose his schedule.
   ``I can think of a lot of things I want to do and what I can't
think of, somebody else does,'' he says with a laugh. ``I sure
don't need the money, so I do the ones I want to do.''
   He makes his opera debut April 16 in a new production of
Rossini's ``The Thieving Magpie.'' The next evening, he begins a
tour in California that ends May 9 in New York, with a stop at
``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.''
   ``He has a performance schedule that goes from here to there and
back,'' interjects his wife, Jeanne, who travels with him. She
performs with him in chamber groups, and will play the part of the
magpie in the second and final Philadelphia performance on April 20.
   The idea to play the title role in Rossini's ``The Thieving
Magpie'' was not Galway's.
   ``I had never thought of it before and no one else did it
before. So I decided to do it,'' Galway says.
   The opera had its American debut in 1827 in Philadelphia. But no
flutist has ever been cast as the magpie.
   During rehearsals in Philadelphia, Galway's impish side surfaced
from time to time. At one point he put a ``boom box'' on his
shoulder and said: ``James Galway and the 20 best hits from the
street. How's that for my new album?''
   Underneath the wit, the blunt charm and the bantering nature
that has endeared him to audiences, Galway is very serious about
his craft and is devoted to practice sessions. He's also fiercely
independent about his way, whatever way that may be at the moment,
of playing.
   ``I wouldn't play in an orchestra now,'' he says. ``I wouldn't
want to narrow my music down.''
   However, Galway did branch into serious acting once.
   ``I needed money while I was between Guildhall (School in
London) and the Paris Conservatory. So I took a year off and did
Shakespeare at Stratford-on-Avon,'' he said.
   But he said he was never serious about a switch. ``I've always
thought of music. Nothing else.''
   It was the combination of acting and music, complete with a
costume and intricate staging while playing his magic flute, that
appealed to Galway in doing the opera.
   Rossini originally wrote the work using an actor as the magpie
who stole the silver spoon and caused a young servant girl to be
sentenced to death. The Opera Company of Philadelphia decided in
the first American production of the work in this century to create
a special role for someone such as Galway.
   The rolling notes that Galway plays as he flits about the stage
were borrowed from passages Rossini wrote for the violin and flute
as parts of the orchestra.
   For his motions on stage, Galway draws on his own observations
of the bird, an outgrowth of his interest in the animal kingdom.
   He talked about the latest television program he had enjoyed on
animals in the wild, then with a burst of Galway directness denied
that his performance was to be a statement on anything but music.
   ``I didn't study birds for years to do this. I studied music,''
he says. ``It just so happens that I would know a dead magpie in
the road if I saw one.''

<HEAD>Soviet Army Despised in Poland, but Will Stay for Now</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LEGNICA, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last year, Poles showered Soviet soldiers
with rocks and bottles 21 times during a 210-mile training march.
This year, Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki opposes a speedy Red
Army withdrawal.
   They have disdained Soviet soldiers for decades, but Poles seem
to understand Mazowiecki's point.
   Poland has not joined Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the rush to
be free of the Red Army _ not because it loathes the ``occupiers''
less, but because it fears the army of a reunited Germany at least
as much.
   The Solidarity prime minister, leader of the first non-Communist
government to take office in the former Soviet bloc, envisions a
Soviet withdrawal only within an overall security arrangement for
Europe.
   A survey by television's Center for Public Opinion Research in
March indicated 47 percent of Poles felt the Red Army should go,
but the date should depend on events in Germany.
   ``Maybe a year ago, people would say the Soviet troops shouldn't
be here, that their presence was more like a political presence,''
said Franciszek Grzywacz, a magazine editor in the garrison town of
Legnica. ``Now people are saying it is a kind of a shield against
Germany.''
   Poland's predicament is as old as its geographical position
between Germany and Russia, and has led new voices to utter a
version of the old regime's argument.
   For decades, the Communists used the danger from Germany,
combined with the general threat from the West, to support Poland's
alliance with Moscow and the Red Army presence.
   Most estimates put the number of Soviet soldiers in Poland at
40,000 to 45,000, well below the 380,000 in East Germany, 80,000 in
Czechoslovakia and 65,000 in Hungary.
   Those in Poland, however, form the supply link from the Soviet
Union to the East German frontier of the Warsaw Pact.
   One of the most important Soviet military headquarters, the
Western Theater of Military Operations, is in Legnica, in
southwestern Poland, 55 miles from East Germany. The headquarters
would coordinate a Warsaw Pact offensive, using the Baltic fleet,
air force support and troops from across Eastern Europe.
   Legnica, 250 miles southeast of Warsaw, is one of the few places
in Poland where the Red Army is visible. The well-preserved painted
brick architecture is a reminder of the town's place in the swath
of Silesian territory taken from Germany after World War II.
   Most of its 100,000 people, however, are Poles uprooted from
eastern territories annexed by the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin.
   That adds emotion to the atmosphere as Soviet officers stroll
the streets and black Russian limousines rush commanders to and
from prewar mansions in a vast Red Army compound enclosed by by a
7-foot concrete wall.
   Tales of Soviet army abuses are legion: secret installations in
the forest, bombs gone astray, ditches running black with leaking
fuel from military airports, low-flying planes buzzing farms.
   Russian-bashing is a popular sport: Soviet soldiers live
rent-free and make slums of the scarce apartments denied to Poles,
cover windows with copies of Pravda instead of curtains, throw
garbage out the windows, favor strip shows, are above Polish law
when they commit crimes or cause traffic accidents.
   ``If the Soviets go home, people in this town will have nothing
to talk about,'' said Grzywacz, the magazine editor.
   Teacher Jolanta Tochinecka does not see the Red Army as a
safeguard. ``Poles know they can rely only on themselves,'' he
said. ``That was shown in 1939,'' when the German invasion of
Poland started World War II.
   Scrawled slogans may say ``Tanks to the Volga,'' and one roughly
translates to ``Soviets go back to your garbage,'' but the soldiers
are an economic benefit to Legnica.
   There is a brisk trade in Soviet gold and television sets
outside the elegant turn-of-the-century officers' center.
Shopkeepers rely on the well-paid soldiers and their families, who
relish the relatively comfortable five-year tours in Poland.
   Residents speak gratefully of access to sophisticated hospitals
and some other facilities _ the Soviets have their own schools,
police force, book stores and work crews _ but the communities are
largely separate.
   ``There are not two sides of town,'' Grzywacz said. ``There are
two cities.''
   Soviet troops came to Poland ``temporarily'' under a 1956
agreement that contains assurances of Polish sovereignty and
provisions that the Kremlin will pay for their upkeep.
   In Czechoslovakia and Hungary, negotiations already have turned
Soviet soldiers toward home. The Red Army has been in those
countries since it crushed Hungary's anti-Stalinist uprising of
1956 and the Czechoslovak ``Prague spring'' liberalization of 1968.
   It was Moscow that proposed talks on leaving Poland.
Mazowiecki's government announced in March that discussions would
begin on finances and the ``inconveniences'' suffered by
communities where Soviet soldiers are stationed.
   The Polish subsidy for the troops amounted to 26 billion zlotys
($2.7 million) in 1989, according to statistics compiled by Radio
Free Europe.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has demanded the Soviets withdraw
this year, but government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said
in mid-March:
   ``Poland is at work on the proposals to be presented during the
Vienna negotiations regarding the overall withdrawal of Soviet
troops in the context of a new European security system.''

<HEAD>Candidates See Smart Politics in Death Penalty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The boos drowned out Dianne Feinstein when she
told California Democrats, ``Yes, I support the death penalty.''
But the former San Francisco mayor was betting that her stand would
draw cheers from voters worried about drugs and crime.
   Her judgment is echoed in campaigns from California to the
Eastern seaboard, from the Sun Belt to the Rust Belt. It is an
election year in which death and politics are locked in a
rhetorical embrace and candidates engage in macabre numbers games.
   In a campaign ad, Republican Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida
proclaims he has signed ``some 90 death warrants.'' But only five
people have been executed since Martinez took office in 1987.
   ``As district attorney and attorney general he's put or kept 277
murderers on death row,'' said an ad for John Van de Kamp, who says
he personally opposes capital punishment. Nobody's been executed in
23 years in California, where Van de Kamp and Feinstein are
battling for the Democratic nomination for governor.
   ``There's a very clear consensus all over the electorate that
the death penalty is a good thing,'' said Republican political
consultant Charles Black.
   Lynn Cutler, a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee,
lamented the fact that so many candidates ``glory'' about their
roles in executions. But she conceded that the majority of the
people strongly support the death penalty.
   ``The death penalty has become this sort of simplistic litmus
test or symbolic test of whether you're tough on crime,'' said
Frank Greer, a Democratic consultant who questions whether voters
will be satisfied with ringing endorsements of capital punishment.
   ``You can make a case that a lot of people will wake up to find
voters expect more,'' said Greer.
   He found support for his case in Texas, where state Treasurer
Ann Richards won a vicious contest for the Democratic nomination
for governor.
   Richards' two opponents _ former Gov. Mark White and Attorney
General Jim Mattox _ competed for the right to claim they had
executed the most criminals, prompting a Richards aide to quip:
``Maybe the next step will be scratch-and-sniff ads so voters can
sample the smell of the death chamber.''
   ``My view on the death penalty is that it's the law and that the
law should be carried out,'' said Richards, who rarely mentioned
the issue.
   She once referred to White's ads _ which showed him walking past
giant mug shots of criminals executed while he was governor _ and
said: ``I think perhaps they are contrasting me with a guy who goes
on TV and struts up and down in front of pictures of people who
have been executed. It's macabre and strange.''
   Time may prove Greer right. But the consensus among politicians,
including Greer client Andrew Young, is that the place to be is in
support of capital punishment.
   ``The state has got to have the right to put mad dogs to
death,'' said Young, the former mayor of Atlanta who is campaigning
for governor of Georgia.
   Long an opponent of capital punishment, Young said his view
began to change after he ``went to a half dozen policemen's
funerals'' while mayor.
   Van de Kamp, the early favorite to win California's Democratic
gubernatorial primary, suddenly found himself scrambling after
polls showed Feinstein soaring into the lead. Analysts were divided
on whether her surge was attributable to a particular issue like
capital punishment or the result of a large television buy during a
period when Van de Kamp was not running commercials.
   But it was clear that Van de Kamp and his strategists thought
he'd better edge away from his opposition to the death penalty.
   As state attorney general, Van de Kamp took a prominent role in
asking the U.S. Supreme Court to end a stay of execution granted
Robert Alton Harris, a prisoner on death row in San Quentin prison.
   ``This is a man who said he didn't believe in the death penalty
up until the time he began running for governor,'' said Feinstein.
   ``I am running the law office responsible for handling the
case,'' Van de Kamp responded angrily.
   The most prominent exception to the rhetorical rush to the
execution chamber is Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York.
   Cuomo is expected to run for a third term this year and his name
is always high on lists of presidential prospects.
   Lee Miringoff of the Marist College Institute of Public Opinion,
said his polls of New York voters have found little evidence Cuomo
is hurt by his opposition to the death penalty despite polls
showing overwhelming public support for capital punishment.
   ``No one's going to accuse Mario Cuomo of making policy by
public opinion polls,'' said Miringoff. ``The fact that Mario Cuomo
opposes the death penalty and has a proposal for life imprisonment
without parole comes as no news to New Yorkers. He's able to make
in New York the case that he's a man of strong convictions so that
even if you disagree with him on this issue it doesn't affect your
overall view of him.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is a modern urban phenomenon: kids robbing _
and sometimes killing _ other kids over the hottest designer
sneakers, sunglasses or athletic jackets.
   In Chicago alone, four young men have died in little more than a
year over multi-colored, satiny jackets with splashy team logos
across the back.
   Those not dying for their clothing might instead be robbed.
   On an icy day this winter, an 11-year-old boy was forced to hand
over his $61 gym shoes to four youths, then walk the several blocks
to his home barefoot, one of scores of incidents that occur each
month, police say.
   ``Kids who try to keep their jackets are beaten or killed,''
said Sollie Vincent, commander of the Gang Crimes Section of the
Chicago police. ``It's a very cold, callous frame of mind.''
   To combat the problem, schools from Baltimore to Miami to Los
Angeles are falling back on an old idea: dress codes.
   Some public schools even have instituted uniforms, traditionally
associated with parochial schools.
   ``It's a definite trend,'' said Tim Callahan, a spokesman for
the National Association of State Boards of Education. ``Kids are
going to learn best in an environment free of undue, inappropriate
pressures, and certainly one that's free of violence.
   ``If clothing becomes a disruption to education, then we
certainly are supportive of removing that barrier,'' he said.
   ``Starter'' jackets _ athletic jackets named for their
manufacturer, Starter Sportswear Inc. of New Haven, Conn. _ have
sparked numerous crimes in Chicago, including four murders, police
say.
   In a grim acknowledgment of the garment's popularity, the police
department last year created a separate category for ``Starter
jacket murders'' in its citywide statistics.
   ``We are hoping these are isolated situations that are not
long-term,'' said Thomas McAuliffe, human resources director for
Starter. ``We have a responsible attitude towards the communities
in which we have operations.''
   Educators say dress codes that eliminate some popular items and,
in some cases, gang colors, not only help stem violence but allow
students to concentrate on learning.
   ``We try to discourage children from buying hot items,'' says
Jim Murray, assistant principal at a middle school in Chicago's
troubled Englewood neighborhood. ``When they don't wear those items
to school, they don't have problems.''
   ``We have found that, subtly, it is changing attitudes,''
Alberta Mitchell, counselor at Hendricks Academy, said of the
Chicago public elementary school's new uniform policy.
   ``The children are not supposed to wear gym shoes, so that
eliminates the problem of buying brand-name gym shoes symbolizing
status,'' Miss Mitchell said. ``We are trying to eliminate the
problem of children feeling like they have to have designer-type
clothes. It seems to have a calming effect.''
   In Chicago, as in many of the nation's largest school districts,
dress codes are the prerogative of individual schools.
   In Baltimore, uniforms are recommended, although not mandatory,
for elementary school students, and a dress code is suggested for
secondary schools. Educators say uniforms now are the norm at 74 of
the city's 118 elementary schools.
   School officials can't recall any crimes over clothing since the
policy was instituted last fall, and Baltimore police say the
problem virtually has disappeared.
   ``It still happens, but not with any frequency,'' said police
spokesman Dennis Hill.
   Next fall, high schools in Detroit will have the option of
adopting a dress code. The new policy by Detroit's Board of
Education was prompted in part by the December shooting of a
student over his $135 goose-down jacket.
   Detroit police say crimes over clothing are on the decline.
   ``It's not like the old days 10 years ago,'' said Sgt.
Christopher Buck.
   In New York's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, a high school
principal earlier this year barred students from wearing removable
gold caps on their teeth, saying the faddish caps were robberies
waiting to happen.
   But the new policies have not been cheered in all quarters.
   In March, high school students in Palmdale, Calif., enraged by a
new anti-gang dress code, boycotted classes and pelted a sheriff's
patrol car with rocks.
   And there is some support for student resistance to the
dress-code trend.
   Laws allowing schools to require uniforms are ``a way of trying
to see that all students look alike, act alike and think alike,''
said Jane Whicher, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties
Union in Illinois.
   ``It's important for children to have an appreciation of their
own individuality as well as the constitutional values that protect
that individuality,'' she said. ``Orthodoxy in apparel is not
something a school board should be involved in.''
   Requiring uniforms might also pose a financial hurdle for the
poor, Whicher said, but some families are applauding the trend.
   ``Parents seem to really like the idea,'' said Shel Erlich, a
spokesman for the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's
second-largest public school system. ``It certainly cuts down the
amount of arguing in the morning over what the kids should wear to
school.''
   And some parents are instituting their own dress codes when the
schools are not.
   ``I have two daughters, one a senior in high school,'' said
Charles Hill, who heads security for 40 Chicago schools. ``We don't
entertain the thought of a Starter jacket.
   ``We want our kids to have everything,'' he said, ``but we don't
want our kids to have something that endangers their lives.''
   Law enforcement officials welcome the move toward dress codes.
   ``Any way that a kid can avoid the problem seems rational to
me,'' said Vincent, of the gang crime unit. ``Parents would be a
little kinder to their kids if they deprived them of the things
they beg for.''

<HEAD>IOUs from Hurricane Looters Persuade Shop Owners to Stay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAM DiMEO</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When looters plundered
their candy and tobacco shop in the chaos that accompanied
Hurricane Hugo seven months ago, Hal and Mary Longer decided to
return to the States.
   Now they've decided to stay, touched by the unexpected honesty
of some of the looters.
   While cleaning up their ransacked shop, the Longers were
astonished to find a dozen IOUs from people who took part in a
three-day looting rampage on St. Croix Island after Hugo struck
Sept. 17.
   Then other fellow residents _ realtors, business people, a
lawyer, even a territorial senator _ began stopping by to confess
they, too, had taken things from the store and would pay for them.
   ``It makes me feel great that there are some honest people in
the world,'' Longer, 63, said recently in his refurbished store.
   ``It restores your faith,'' his wife, 49, said from behind the
candy counter.
   Of the three main U.S. Virgin Islands, east of Puerto Rico, the
hurricane hit St. Croix by far the hardest. About 90 percent of the
houses were destroyed or damaged, and reconstruction continues on
the island, which has 55,000 permanent residents.
   St. Croix's image as a Caribbean tourist haven was tarnished by
the looting.
   Scores of businesses were plundered. About 100 people were
arrested, and even some police officers and National Guardsmen were
accused of taking part in the looting.
   President Bush sent 1,100 military police, who remained for two
months.
   The Longers, who moved to St. Croix from Davenport, Iowa, in
1987, were visiting Philadelphia when the hurricane struck. They
returned two weeks later to find their shop, called Steele's Smokes
&amp; Sweets for a previous owner, in ruins.
   ``The place was a mess,'' Longer said. ``The inventory was
trashed and even the scales were gone. Cleaning up was the worst,
because they threw stuff all over the walls. There was no need for
that.''
   Their house also was heavily damaged. The Longers said they were
ready to move back to the mainland.
   That was before they found IOUs for stolen goods that had been
left for them in their own shop and the one next door.
   One scribbled on an envelope said: ``I took four boxes of
cigars. I am one of your regular customers. I will pay you when I
see you _ Bill.''
   ``On the back of the envelope, someone else wrote: `I took some
too _ Don,''' Longer said.
   Bill and Don later paid their total debt of $100, he said, and
added, ``Every one of the people but one has voluntarily come in to
pay, and I know the one will.''
   Longer said a man walked in one day, wandered around as if
looking for something to buy, then handed him $27 for six tins of
stolen pipe tobacco, and ``the guy's had a smile on his face every
time he's come back in the shop.''
   Other St. Croix shopkeepers had similar experiences.
   Jeff Seroogy, 39, owns the Solitude Country Store, a grocery in
the island's affluent East End. After he reopened, Seroogy said,
people approached him wanting to make amends.
   ``When I was first told of some of the people who were in the
store and what they were doing, I was really mad, just very angry
and disappointed,'' he said. ``But when they started coming back
and, indeed, came forth and paid, I wasn't angry.''
   Hal and Mary Longer said their rebuilding costs were $136,000,
including $37,000 in damaged or stolen inventory, and insurance
covered all but $14,000 of the loss.
   The main reason they decided to stay, they said, is the way
their customers have treated them since the hurricane.
   Lt. Gov. Derek Hodge said the IOUs showed many looters were
ordinary people panicked by the ferocious storm.
   ``In the darkest days of our despair, there were those who
recognized being a good citizen still had a value,'' he said.

<HEAD>Actor Says the Jim and Tammy Bakker Story Not a Caricature</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Kevin Spacey says care was taken to see
that the story of Jim and Tammy Bakker in NBC's ``Fall From Grace''
didn't lapse into caricature.
   ``You have to play a real person,'' said Spacey, who stars as
the convicted television evangelist in the Sunday movie. Bernadette
Peters co-stars as Bakker's wife, Tammy.
   ``You have to have a respect for that human being, regardless of
what's happened to him,'' Spacey said. ``We're all familiar with
the ridicule and criticism. Once you get past the fact that I don't
really look like Jim Bakker, you get into their life and problems
as a married couple. We never got into a cartoon. No one wanted to
make this a joke. I tried to play him as a man, not so much an
imitation as a suggestion.''
   The movie tells the personal story behind the rise and fall of
Bakker's empire, built upon his success as a television minister.
It begins in 1980 with his dream of Heritage Village and ends with
his ouster from the PTL ministry in May 1987.
   NBC paid the Bakkers for the rights to their story, but said it
did not give them any control over the story.
   Bakker currently is serving a 45-year prison sentence for
bilking money out of his followers to support his lavish lifestyle.
   Spacey, perhaps best known for his role as Mel Proffit on CBS'
``Wiseguy,'' turned down the role when it first was offered.
   ``I was reluctant to do it, but changed my mind after talking to
the director, Karen Arthur,'' he said. ``When it was offered to me,
I had the same reaction as other people. They laughed and said,
`Another trashy TV movie rehashing headlines.' Karen showed me that
it was going to be much more complex than the headlines.
   ``When Bakker first came to notice, he was a beaten man. He was
clawing at air. I think that's why people had a pathetic view of
him. We look at him when he was at the peak of his career and
energy. We also stay away from the caricature of Tammy as a crying
woman with mascara running down her face. It may have happened in
real life, but not to the extent of all the ridicule and gags.''
   The only concessions to making Spacey look like Bakker were a
hairpiece and a dental appliance to change the shape of his mouth.
   The movie, written by Ken Trevey, also stars Beth Grant as
Tammy's confidant, Richard Herd as Bakker assistant Richard Dortch,
and Richard Paul as the Rev. Jerry Falwell. Jean Kasem makes a
cameo appearance as a real estate saleswoman.
   After completing the movie in Los Angeles, Spacey returned to
New York for a new stage play called ``National Anthems,'' which he
had done at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Conn., with Tom
Berenger. Another actor will be cast in Berenger's role for the
Broadway version.
   Spacey also stars in the upcoming theatrical movie ``Show of
Force,'' along with Robert Duvall and Andy Garcia.
   ``Show of Force'' is based on a true story about the killing of
young pro-independence students in Puerto Rico, based on the book
``Murder Under Two Flags'' by Ann Nelson. He plays the head of the
FBI office in San Juan.
   He's also been in such movies as ``Dad,'' ``The Right Stuff,''
``The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' ``Heartburn,'' ``Working
Girl'' and ``Henry and June,'' which hasn't yet been released.
   Spacey has appeared three times with Jack Lemmon, playing his
son in the Broadway production of ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night,'' his son-in-law in the movie ``Dad,'' and a reporter in
``The Murder of Mary Phagan,'' a 1987 NBC miniseries based on the
lynching of Leo Frank, in which Lemmon played the governor of
Georgia.
   He looks back fondly on his ``Wiseguy'' role.
   ``Proffit was a man who, on the surface, was an entrepreneur,''
Spacey said. ``He was well known for giving to charities, but his
actual business was gun-running and drugs. He had an illicit
relationship with his sister. It was pretty racy for television.
   ``That's a terrific show for actors,'' he said. ``You know
you're going to create a terrific character. You also know it's
only for a limited time. You get the feel of television without
having to commit to a series.''

<HEAD>Moynihan Mixes Politics and Ideas in Senate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daniel Patrick Moynihan's career hasn't fit
the traditional pattern; while most senators work to change votes,
he works to change minds.
   So there's no Moynihan Act or Moynihan Amendment to mark the
pinnacle of his Senate tenure. His is a different approach,
wholesale instead of retail.
   ``What Moynihan loves to do is take an idea, pluck it out of the
heavens, set it on the table and let it influence events,'' says
Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   The former professor, diplomat and White House official has done
it time and again. He puts forward an idea that at first goes
against common wisdom but stays alive despite efforts by others to
proclaim it dead.
   In the 1960s, as an official first in Democratic and then
Republican administrations, Moynihan wrote about the instability of
black family life and its harmful effects on blacks' chance of
success. Controversial at first, his ideas two decades later drove
the 1988 welfare reform act.
   After President Ford made him United Nations ambassador in 1975,
Moynihan rocked the diplomatic corps by bluntly asserting U.S.
positions. He was particularly sharp-tongued in opposing a
resolution labeling Zionism as a form of racism. He stayed only
eight months before returning to Harvard, but he established the
model for his U.S. successors at the world body.
   In 1976, he was elected to the Senate, giving up his
professorship. But he has clung to the image of an academician.
Tall, gray-haired and tweed-clothed, he seems able to lecture his
colleagues on an infinite range of topics.
   ``He's never had an unspoken thought,'' quipped one colleague.
   His occasional meetings with Washington reporters are called
``tutorials'' by the attendees, who sit in chairs arranged
classroom-like in his office.
   He doesn't just answer questions, he expounds on most anything.
At one recent session, he described the life cycle of the sea
lamprey, a parasitic fish whose control he supports, noting that it
was ``really a nice piece of biology.''
   Unlike many lawmakers, the burden of elected office has not
dampened Moynihan's taste for the controversial. His latest idea on
Social Security has revitalized that penchant.
   Back in 1983, Moynihan was the intellectual force behind an
increase in Social Security payroll taxes so that the system could
build up a surplus for when the baby boom generation retires.
   The surplus is now building at a rate of $1 billion a week, but
instead of being saved for the future as Moynihan intended, it's
being frittered away to cover day-to-day government operating
expenses and make the federal deficit appear smaller.
   Washington's leaders promise to make the surplus ``off-budget''
and thus more sacrosanct. But in reality, that answer is nothing
more than ``how you display your books,'' Moynihan says.
   His solution: Roll back the payroll tax. Simple, but the
political implications are immense.
   The White House and even some fellow Democrats, such as House
Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., label the idea as
dangerous. The politicians don't like to admit that Social Security
taxes are being misused, but nobody seems willing to cut spending
or raise other taxes enough to take their place.
   Some fretted, with prodding from President Bush, that the plan
was somehow ``messing with'' Social Security, a political no-no.
One official even called it goofy. But the biggest White House
worry was that a Democrat was treading on turf the Republicans
thought they owned _ tax cuts.
   Unlike Bush's cherished capital gains tax cut, Moynihan's
benefits would be tilted to the working poor and middle class.
   ``Political genius,'' is what Democratic National Committee
Chairman Ronald Brown called it. Last month, just when Congress
seemed to be putting it on the backmost burner, the DNC endorsed
the plan.
   ``The DNC can do exactly what it wants,'' responded House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ``They are not in the
Congress and they don't have the responsibility to actually produce
a budget. We don't have a consensus in the Congress today to do
Moynihan.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Moynihan's idea will
be put up for a vote in his chamber. But the opposition including
Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, says chances for
passage this year are dim.
   Moynihan said if the people he meets outside of Washington had
their way, his proposal would already be enacted. But the capital's
bureaucracy takes time to turn around, so for now he may have to
settle for less, he said.
   ``If I have one minimum ambition it's that before this is over
the first paragraph of stories about the federal budget and federal
revenues ... would include that they're using $72 billion in trust
fund monies,'' Moynihan said.
   There's no telling when or if his Social Security plan will fly.
But Moynihan, reveling in the spotlight, has found plenty else to
talk about.
   For example, he used a speech before the National Press Club to
press his ideas about Lithuania, pushing the almost quaint
suggestion that the World Court at the Hague could serve as the
mechanism to defuse the dispute between the Soviet Union and its
Baltic republics.
   He also is continuing his lonely effort to promote U.S.
development of technologically advanced trains that ride on
magnetic fields instead of regular tracks.
   ``Could you have a Senate of 100 Moynihans? No. But is it great
to have a few? Sure,'' says Rep. Schumer, who is rumored to be
eyeing a 1992 race against Moynihan's junior Republican colleague,
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   The juxtaposition with D'Amato, widely known as ``senator
pothole'' for his attention to local issues, sometimes makes
Moynihan look as though he pays little attention to the home folks.
But one of Moynihan's favorite topics is a local one, taking the
tolls off the New York Thruway.
   The idea of removing the tolls started in 1956, when Moynihan
was an aide to the governor of New York and the free system of
federal interstate highways was being started.
   ``I was a member of the New York delegation to the 1960
Democratic National Convention. I went to Los Angeles with one
platform plank in my pocket: Tolls off the Thruway,'' he wrote in a
letter to voters in 1982 from his schoolhouse hideaway near Pindars
Corners in upstate New York.
   ``Sixteen years later, I was a candidate for the Senate. I
promised that I would press to take the tolls off the Thruway,'' he
said. ``Finally, in 1982 ... we signed the agreement'' to take
tolls off in 1996 _ 40 years after the effort began.
   ``No business for the short-winded,'' Moynihan concluded.

   Political leadership, according to the
Democrat who wields it in the House, means governing rather than
incessant campaigning, even if the style looks bashful.
   And Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley said he won't change
his ways, despite the dissatisfaction of some Democrats who argue
that leaders should be more confrontational, posting clear themes
and alternatives to challenge the Republican in the White House.
   ``We're unwilling to simply be an opposition party and probe
every weak spot,'' Foley said, adding that people who advocate that
course view the Democrats as a party out of power despite their
command of Congress.
   ``That's not the case,'' the speaker said. ``We are in control
here. ... Part of the time we have to worry, between elections,
about the country's government. ...
   ``Maybe we're not doing it well enough, but it's not because
we're bashful,'' Foley said.
   Foley has been speaker for 10 months, since the resignation of
Jim Wright. After the ethics investigation that marked Wright's
final days, the Washington congressman was promoted as a skilled
legislator with a television style that would help the new team of
Democratic congressional leaders present the party message in
counterpoint to President Bush.
   Now some Democrats are complaining that the party's House and
Senate hierarchy isn't making the case, that there is no real
alternative program or theme, and that Rep. Richard A. Gephardt,
D-Mo., the majority leader, is the only person in the lineup
willing to tackle Bush.
   In the audience as President Bush addressed the American Society
of Newspaper Editors, Gov. James J. Blanchard of Michigan remarked
that Democrats aren't presenting an alternative vision of where the
country should be heading, especially in domestic policies and
programs.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts complained last week
that the party seems muted, timid and befuddled, when it should be
seizing the opportunities presented by the easing of East-West
tensions.
   ``With a few notable exceptions, there has been a kind of
unnatural quiet coming from our party, a sense of yielding ground
to the president, of kowtowing to his veto threats, of confining
our own Democratic efforts to merely marginal improvements in
Republican programs, or almost conceding a second term to President
Bush,'' Kennedy said in a speech at Georgetown University.
   Over a spartan breakfast in the House restaurant _ he's dieted
away 40 pounds _ Foley said his natural inclination is to seek
solutions first and have political arguments later. He said there
will be plenty to argue about before the session ends.
   Foley said Democratic pressure has pushed Bush from timid
proposals into more ambitious ones on some fronts. ``He's doing
more on Eastern Europe now because we demanded it,'' the speaker
said. He said the same thing happened on drug control, on clean air
and on child care legislation, although the Democratic majority is
still pushing farther than Bush wanted.
   ``We may have some tough disagreements in front of the country
on some of these issues,'' Foley said. ``I'm not going to roll over
and drop dead because the president says veto. ... So threaten
veto, go ahead. ...''
   The next line, of course, is make my day, but that's not Foley's
style.
   He said Democratic leaders are not shying from confrontation
because of Bush's still lofty popularity ratings. ``The popularity
is very personal,'' he said. ``But it has a limited political
consequence. ... His popularity doesn't translate to legislative
influence or party preference.''
   Foley said there is no voter pressure to support Bush programs,
nothing like the message from home when Ronald Reagan was pushing
his first-term tax cut. ``There isn't any Bush revolution,'' he
said, adding that the administration is drifting when it should be
leading.
   Then, reflecting on the point, he added that nobody has an
agenda challenging the country to confront real problems, and both
parties share the blame. ``That's my complaint against all of us,''
Foley said.
   Again, the conciliatory ring that bothers some Democrats. It
doesn't bother Foley. He looks back to the days of Sam Rayburn, the
legendary Mr. Speaker, and of Lyndon B. Johnson as Senate majority
leader, recalling their private visits to Dwight D. Eisenhower's
White House to work out legislation.
   ``If anything, the government was less confrontational then than
it is now,'' he said.

<HEAD>Defense Attorneys Challenging Reliability of DNA Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of DNA identification to link suspects
to crimes is being successfully challenged by defense attorneys in
a small but growing number of cases.
   At issue are the reliability of the tests and the way they are
conducted.
   ``In the last year, I am aware of at least seven or eight cases
where after the defense got an expert involved, the prosecution has
withdrawn the evidence,'' says lawyer Peter Neufeld, who
successfully challenged DNA test results in a New York City murder
case last summer.
   The judge in the case cited problems with the laboratory
analysis.
   Since it was first introduced in a U.S. criminal court in 1987,
DNA testing has been presented in 200 cases in at least 36 states.
   The FBI opened its own DNA lab in late 1988 to test samples for
state and local police departments. Since then bureau experts have
presented evidence that has helped convict 44 people.
   ``With everything we have seen so far, we are gaining confidence
in the DNA identification's utility in serving the criminal justice
community,'' said John Hicks, head of the FBI's laboratory division.
   The tests compare genetic material extracted from tissue or body
fluids found at crime scenes with DNA from a suspect's blood.
   While law enforcement authorities hail DNA identification,
defense lawyers have won several victories by exposing what courts
found to be flaws in testing procedures.
   Among them:
   _ The Minnesota Supreme Court refused in November to admit DNA
test results in a murder case, saying the laboratory of Cellmark
Diagnostics in Germantown, Md., did not meet standards for
scientific reliability.
   _ In December, prosecutors in Maine were forced to withdraw DNA
evidence in a sexual assault case and drop charges.
   Defense experts testified there were flaws in procedures used by
Lifecodes Corp. of Valhalla, N.Y., to match DNA in the defendant's
blood with that extracted from a semen sample taken at the crime
scene.
   _ On March 8, a judge presiding over an Oregon rape case refused
to admit DNA test results from the FBI lab, ruling there was too
much scientific controversy over the tests' reliability and too
much danger of confusing jurors with technical details.
   Spokesmen at the two commercial DNA laboratories defended their
procedures, as did Hicks.
   Hicks said computer imaging at the FBI lab ensures that a match
is properly read by the tester. In addition, two examiners must
find that the DNA patterns match before positive results are
declared, he said.
   Michael Baird, director of forensic testing at Lifecodes, said
the court decisions have not discredited the technique or the
procedures' track record.
   ``We are talking about whether the approach itself is correct as
opposed to what's being done in a particular case,'' Baird said.
``There have been situations where portions of the evidence were
not ruled admissible, but the technology itself has been
admissible.''
   ``The issue is not so much should it be accepted as evidence but
how and under what circumstances,'' said Janlori Goldman, a staff
attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's privacy project.
   DNA testing isn't exclusively a weapon for prosecutors.
   Of more than 500 tests completed by the FBI, 36 percent excluded
the suspect in question, Hicks said.
   Public defenders in Washington commissioned DNA tests that
recently exonerated a man whose rape conviction was overturned
because his DNA did not match that taken from a semen stain found
on the woman's clothing.
   Thousands of other tests performed by Cellmark and Lifecodes
have exonerated defendants or encouraged them to plead guilty, said
Mark Storolow, a spokesman for Cellmark.
   ``As a form of evidence it must be very, very powerful because
it results in a lot of plea bargaining,'' he said.
   Rape cases are the most common application of DNA testing in
criminal investigations because hospitals routinely take semen
samples from victims.
   The test can also be useful in solving murders, enabling police
to determine, for example, that blood on a suspect's clothing was
from the victim. It also is used for paternity tests.
   ``When it goes to the identity of the person, that's when it's
particularly relevant,'' said Jay B. Stephens, the U.S. attorney in
Washington.
   To check for a match, scientists use enzymes to ``cut'' DNA
strands into small pieces and place them on laboratory gelatin. The
fragments move along the gelatin and form patterns similar to the
price-code bars on supermarket merchandise.
   Each person, except for identical twins, has a singular genetic
makeup so the pattern should be unique.
   Based on the size of the test sample and data taken from DNA
tests drawn from samplings of the population, scientists calculate
the odds against a pattern being repeated.
   Neufeld and other lawyers argue that laboratories use
less-than-objective criteria for deciding that two DNA patterns
match.
   In the Maine case, expert witnesses questioned the procedures
Lifecodes used to adjust for a phenomenon called ``bandshifting'' _
in which the fragments do not move evenly along the gelatin.
   Thomas Caskey, a medical professor who is starting a DNA lab at
Baylor University in Houston, dismisses those who question the
reliability of tests.
   ``It is extremely easy to determine whether one has a match
between the suspect and the forensic specimen,'' he said.
   But Neufeld argues that like other scientific evidence, DNA
should be subject to rigorous court scrutiny, particularly if it's
used to determine if a person is going to prison.

<HEAD>Therapists Fleecing Public with Self-Help Books, Psychologist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDITH A. RUSSO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Enter any bookstore and you'll find walls of
self-help manuals. They'll save your marriage, cure your phobia,
release the ``inner you,'' or enable you to stick to the only diet
you'll ever need.
   Many of them make claims on the covers or jackets that the
contents don't deliver, and some use theories that have not been
proved, said psychologist Gerald Rosen, who wants his fellow
professionals to do something about that.
   He suggests a kind of Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval from
the American Psychological Association. Books would be required to
state how methods had been tested, on whom, and how effective they
were. And now the market includes cassette tapes, too.
   ``We have to have these products marketed with accurate claims
and not take advantage of the public,'' said Rosen, who is in
private practice in Seattle and has written a self-help book of his
own, about phobias.
   Rosen had hoped to present a ``Golden Fleece Award'' for
self-help psychotherapies at the APA's convention last August in
New Orleans to embarrass therapists who made exaggerated claims
about untested programs. He had planned to pass out noisemakers,
and make awards based on the level of honks and boos each book
received.
   But the APA nixed the idea.
   ``Very bad taste,'' said Charles Spielberger, APA president.
``It's not scientific evaluation, people booing.''
   If an APA member writes a book that violates the organization's
ethical principles and if someone files a claim, the APA would
investigate, said Spielberger, a psychology professor at the
University of South Florida, Tampa.
   ``We don't shrink for a minute from expelling or censuring a
member who doesn't follow APA code,'' said Raymond Fowler, a
psychologist and APA chief executive officer, but ``you can't just
let one member speak for the association and say, `Here's a bad guy
doing a bad job.'''
   But APA may consider regulating member authors.
   ``We will start a serious consideration of APA's role in looking
at self-help books and ... (whether) we need to develop a task
force to draw up guidelines or inform our members of general
standards,'' Fowler said recently.
   ``The truth is, I wouldn't want to underestimate some of these
books. They are very sound and very sensitively thought out,'' said
Fowler, ``and for some individuals it may be the only psychological
help they'll obtain.''
   And evaluating every self-help book would be an enormous
undertaking.
   Rosen's book, ``Don't Be Afraid,'' had its share of exaggerated
claims, he said, and the experience taught him it would be possible
for the APA to set up a standard contract for psychologists to
negotiate control of book promotion.
   One way to deal with book jacket hyperbole, Rosen said, is for
authors to take a tough stand with publishers. But Herbert Holtje,
a literary agent, said it is nearly impossible for writers to
maintain that kind of control.
   It is unrealistic that self-help books ``should be marketed
without consideration of the competitive climate created by
publishers,'' Holtje wrote in the journal American Psychologist.
   Albert Ellis, president of the Institute for Rational-Emotive
Therapy and a psychologist in New York City, has written more than
50 self-help books.
   ``I'm critical of some self-help books but definitely in favor
of others,'' said Ellis, who would approve of a program to test a
book for effectiveness. But he said he doubts publishers would wait
around for that.
   ``I must say there's something frustrating about the hard work
of research day in and day out just to get a little way and someone
reels out a pot-boiler and makes thousands,'' said Patricia
Keith-Spiegel, a professor of psychology at California State
University at Northridge who teaches a course in ethics.
   She was on the APA's ethics committee at a time when a
psychologist couldn't give out professional advice except in a
client-patient relationship.
   ``Then everything exploded,'' she said, and psychologists were
on radio and television, they were writing columns, they were
writing books.
   She is writing her own how-to book, how to get into graduate
school.
   ``I've been a vocal critic of self-help books,'' Keith-Spiegel
said. ``I'm going to have to research and check out everything I
say.''
   Rosen cites a number of books he feels exaggerate their claims.
One is ``The Doctors Guide to Instant Stress Relief: A
Psychological and Medical System,'' by psychologists Ronald G.
Nathan and Thomas E. Staats, and Dr. Paul J. Rosch.
   ``I don't believe there's any such thing as instant stress
relief,'' Rosen said. ``It could have been called the `Doctors
Guide to Stress Relief You Can Learn in a Few Weeks.'''
   But Nathan said the title was suggested by the publisher and
agreed upon only after much discussion among the authors. While it
may take six months to learn the technique of instant relaxation,
it then can be applied in seconds, he said.
   One danger in self-help books is that people can misdiagnose
themselves and fail to seek help, Rosen contends. But Nathan said
he and his co-authors provided a test for the reader to determine
if professional help is needed.
   ``My pitch has been trying to convince psychology professionals
that it's time to take self-help books seriously because they've
set up an alternate therapy system, and the books reach many more
consumers than we will,'' said Steven Starker, chief of
psychological services and professor of medical psychology at
Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, Ore.
   He also made that point in an article debating the topic in the
magazine American Psychologist.
   ``I have talked to a lot of people over the years who have found
a great deal of help in self-help books,'' said Bernie Zilbergeld,
a psychologist in private practice in Oakland, Calif., and
co-author of ``Mind Power: Getting What You Want Through Mental
Training.''
   ``If they can go out and pay $5 for a paperback book and get
help from it without seeing me, why not?'' Zilbergeld said.
   Rosen admits he sounds self-serving: He charges $95 for an hour
of therapy. But, he said, professionals should not promise the
public more than they can deliver.

<TEXT>
   A study of more than 12,800 men bolsters research
arguing that quitting smoking and eating low-fat foods can help
lower the risk of heart disease.
   The study, published in the April 6 Journal of the American
Medical Association, found that men at high risk for heart disease
who were given dietary advice and other special treatment had a 24
percent lower death rate from heart attacks than those who received
ordinary care.
   The death rate from heart disease was 10.6 percent lower and the
overall death rate was 7.7 percent lower in the first group,
researchers found.
   Treatment consisted of advice to lower cholesterol levels,
counseling on quitting smoking and improved drug therapy to control
high blood pressure.
   About half the 12,860 men studied at 22 clinics nationwide
received the special treatment several times a year, while the
other half were examined annually and received additional treatment
only if needed.
   The study of men aged 35 to 57 began in late 1973 and ended in
1982. The results reported in JAMA occurred between 1982 and a
December 1985 follow-up review, said Marcus O. Kjelsberg, a
statistician at the University of Minnesota's School of Public
Health, where the data was analyzed.
   Initial examinations in 1982 showed no significant differences
between the groups, which surprised researchers and prompted the
follow-up, Kjelsberg said in a telephone interview.
   The ultimate results were not surprising, given the multitude of
data showing a link between diet, smoking and heart disease, said
Jeremiah Stamler, a cardiovascular epidemiologist at Northwestern
University and a principal investigator in the study.
   Researchers expected to see the results earlier, at the end of
the study, but they failed to anticipate several factors that may
account for the delay, Stamler said.
   One reason may have been that all the volunteers were relatively
healthy, despite facing a higher than normal risk for heart disease
because they smoked, had high blood pressure or high cholesterol
levels or a combination of the three, Stamler said.
   Another reason for the delayed results may have been a change in
drug treatment for high blood pressure that occurred toward the end
of the study. The later treatment was considered more effective,
Kjelsberg said.
   Researchers did not determine how many of the men who had
received special treatment continued to seek it after the study
ended, he said, but they asssumed that many stuck to their
healthier lifestyles.
   The study was funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute in Bethesda, Md.

<TEXT>
   ``Pervasive'' fraud played a major role in the
collapse of many savings and loans, FBI Director William Sessions
says, but tracking down crime is difficult because of the complex
nature of the institutions' deals.
   ``The types of cases we are seeing in Texas frequently involve
the looting of institutions for the direct financial benefit of
officers, directors or major stockholders,'' he said.
   Sessions testified Wednesday at a House Banking Committee
hearing in Dallas, leading a parade of witnesses who blamed fraud
for much of the thrift industry's problems.
   ``Although it was the general economic downturn in Texas that
surfaced the problem, it appears to the FBI as if a pervasive
pattern of fraudulent lending activity began much earlier,'' he
said.
   ``Experience demonstrates that insider abuse is a major factor
in almost all of our investigations involving failed financial
institutions,'' Sessions said.
   The committee, chaired by Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, is holding two
days of hearings in Dallas to examine investigations of fraud in
the industry. The hearing was scheduled to continue today, although
at least three of the listed witnesses indicated they wouldn't show.
   The committee has asked key figures at some of the most
notorious failed thrifts to testify, but only one, Thomas Gaubert,
has indicated he will appear.
   Gaubert, who has been acquitted once on fraud charges, was
chairman of Independent American Savings Association. The three
others asked to testify were Edwin T. McBirney, former chairman at
Sunbelt Savings Association of Texas; Don R. Dixon former owner of
Vernon Savings and Loan Association; and Jarrett Woods, of Western
Savings Association.
   All four institutions were recipients of multimillion dollar
bailouts and have been targets of federal investigations.
   ``This is not a problem that is limited to Texas, or even to the
Southwest,'' Sessions said. ``More incidents of insider abuse have
been identified in Texas, however, because the Texas institutions
are coming under closer scrutiny as they are being declared
insolvent.''
   In North Texas alone, Sessions said regulators have ``38
separate savings and loans institutions identified wherein major
conspiratorial fraud is alleged. Over 500 subjects have been
identified for investigation and possible prosecution.
   ``Potential financial loss exposure is $10.5 billion,'' he said.
   Gonzalez criticized the Bush administration for being slow to
implement regulations and safeguards adopted last year in bailout
legislation.
   ``We gave the regulatory and the law enforcement agencies
unprecedented power to deal with the crisis and the cleanup,''
Gonzalez said, but the administration left key jobs unfilled and
failed to develop a ``sense of urgency.''
   ``The recovery machinery at the Resolution Trust Corp. creaks
along like some old Model T with many of its parts missing. The
biggest evidence of life and vigor has been the outlandish
bureaucratic infighting that has paralyzed and driven away the
better people,'' Gonzalez said.
   The RTC is the agency charged with rescuing failed thrifts.
   ``The American people _ judging from my mail and my telephone
calls _ are angry about what they see as `business as usual'
approach to a disaster that is costing them dearly,'' Gonzalez said.
   Sessions defended his agency's efforts, recalling bank fraud
investigations as far back as 1982. He said a shortage of resources
and the complexity of the frauds had hampered the agency's work.
   ``It is often difficult to distinguish failures that involve
fraud from failures resulting from poor management and poor
business decisions,'' Sessions said.
   Sessions said the FBI is investigating 530 failed institutions,
including 276 banks, 234 savings and loans and 20 credit unions;
198 of the institutions, including one-third of the thrift cases,
are in Texas.
   In addition, Sessions said the FBI has more than 3,000 pending
cases of traditional bank fraud and embezzlement involving $100,000
or more.
   Other witnesses, who included former federal and state
regulators and other officials, testified about the regulatory
climate in Texas and in Washington and said top officials and some
congressmen refused to recognize the industry's problems in the mid
1980s.

   The recent sharp fall in oil prices has
prompted ``intense discussions'' among OPEC nations, including the
possibility of an emergency meeting by ministers, analysts said.
   ``There has been some contact among the ministers about the
possibility of meeting to discuss the problem,'' a source close to
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said Wednesday.
The source spoke on condition of anonymity.
   OPEC spokesmen in Vienna, the group's headquarters, said no
meeting had been planned.
   Some doubted the ministers would gather so soon before their
scheduled meeting in late May. At that time, all 13 ministers will
set their production and pricing guidelines for the last half of
the year.
   But the source close to OPEC said the organization's
eight-member monitoring panel could meet in a special session to
discuss the price declines, or that an even smaller group could
hold informal talks.
   ``There are intense discussions,'' he said.
   A fall in prices had been expected in the often-weak second
quarter, but the sharpness in recent days has been startling.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, fell
by some 25 percent in the past 11 weeks. On Wednesday the
near-month contract dropped below $17 a barrel at one point on the
New York Mercantile Exchange before rebounding strongly to finish
up 38 cents at $18.06 a barrel.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC
was $17.12 a barrel in the first week of April, off from $17.26 in
the last week of March and below the cartel's $18 a barrel target
price.
   Analysts blamed the price drop on overproduction by some OPEC
members and seasonally lower demand by the United States and other
consuming nations in the April-June quarter.
   Peter Gignoux, director of the international energy department
at Shearson Lehman Hutton in London, estimated the cartel's
production last week at just over 24.5 million barrels a day, well
over OPEC's cap of 22.1 million barrels a day for the January-June
period.
   Peter Bogin, associate director for oil markets at Cambridge
Energy Research Associates in Paris, said, ``It's the spring
weakness everybody has been talking about. ... Demand is down
because it's always down at this time of year.''
   He predicted prices could fall further in the near-term before
firming in June when demand for gasoline picks up with the summer
driving season in the United States and elsewhere.
   In a report last week, the International Energy Agency said OPEC
pumped about 23.7 million barrels a day in March, the same as in
the previous month.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. is throwing in the towel in its
truck advertising battle with Chevrolet, but there's a string
attached.
   Ford, which has dominated truck sales for more than a dozen
years, will stop using comparison advertising in its new round of
truck ads, advertising manager John Vanderzee said Wednesday.
   But the new series of ads, which debut this month, can be
changed easily to insert a Chevrolet or two if the company feels it
has to, he said.
   ``It is a major new direction for us resulting from customer
research,'' Vanderzee said. ``We are not interested in advertising
wars anymore.
   ``We're not going to take on Chevrolet anymore.''
   Chevrolet has no immediate plans to drop its current run of
comparison ads, said Dave Hudgens, a spokesman for the General
Motors Corp. division.
   ``I do know that the truck advertising people in particular,
felt that they were very effective,'' Hudgens said. ``If you have
something that's very effective it makes sense to continue with
it.''
   Ford and Chevrolet have taken each other on with pointed and
sometimes snippy advertisements.
   Chevy's ``Ditch of Doom'' ad showed a Chevrolet pickup plowing
through a muddy trench while occupants of a Ford truck jumped into
the muck to manually lock front wheels and make their truck a
four-wheel-drive vehicle.
   Chevrolet claimed in a later advertisement that its trucks
outsold Ford trucks in Ford County, Ill.
   Ford fired back with an ad acknowledging that Chevrolet outsold
it _ in one month by one truck. The ad said Ford outsold Chevrolet
for the entire year in Ford County and, for extra measure, in Chevy
Chase, Md.
   Through March 31 this year, Ford sold 10.8 percent more light
trucks than Chevrolet, 352,469 to 318,247. And for the first half
of the 1990 model year, Ford's trucks sold at a pace 13.1 percent
faster than Chevy's.
   ``We're gaining ground on them, they're not gaining ground on
us,'' Vanderzee said.
   Ford's ads responding to Chevy's were endorsed by dealers,
Vanderzee said. Ford officials have been on a 33-city dealer tour
during the past month telling dealers, among other things, about
the new truck advertising.
   Cecil Davis, general sales manager at Coliseum Ford in Portland,
Ore., said he liked the comparison ads.
   ``I always thought it was a good case they were making,'' he
said. ``If it was one way or another I would wish they would keep
the comparison ads.''
   While telling dealers that the corporation's ads won't show
comparisons with Chevrolet, Vanderzee said some dealers may not be
able to resist it in local advertising.
   ``If they want to take on Chevrolet or Toyota in their market,
they are going to do it,'' Vanderzee said. ``We may say that we
don't like it.''

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shell Oil Co. is joining other oil companies in
pumping a new gasoline that reduces hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide
emissions.
   Shell's gas, called SU 2000E, was put on the market in the nine
metropolitan areas the Bush administration has identified as having
the most severe air quality problems, said Frank H. Richardson,
Shell's president and chief executive officer.
   ``We think this new product from Shell represents an important
step toward improving the nation's air quality,'' Richardson said
Wednesday.
   The gas is being sold in the areas of New York City, Chicago,
Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Milwaukee, San Diego
and Hartford, Conn.
   It also is available in the Washington D.C. area, which was
targeted as having a serious, not a severe, air quality problem.
Houston-based Shell said it may expand production in the future.
   Other oil companies that have introduced reformulated gasolines
include Arco, Phillips Petroleum, Marathon, Exxon, Amoco, Mobil,
Citgo and Sun Oil. Those companies generally are selling the new
gasoline in limited test markets.
   More than 2,000 Shell stations are selling the gas, which can be
used in virtually any car. The new gas has the same octane number
and additive package as Shell's SU 2000 premium gas, which it has
replaced in the 10 targeted areas.
   ``We obviously do not view our introduction of SU 2000E as a
total solution to the nation's air quality problems. We do believe
that it is an important step in the right direction,'' Richardson
said.
   The new gasoline reduces hydrocarbon vapor emissions, a
component in smog formation, and carbon monoxide emissions from
automobile tailpipes, Shell officials said.
   Steven L. Miller, president of Shell Refining and Marketing Co.,
said the carbon monoxide emissions are reduced because the gas
contains methyl Tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE.
   MTBE replaces butane, which results in a gasoline with a lower
vapor pressure that evaporates less quickly.
   ``By reducing the vapor pressure of gasoline, we reduce the
pounds of hydrocarbons that escape into the atmosphere through
evaporation,'' he said.
   Richardson said if all of Shell's premium gas customers in the
targeted areas used the new gas, there will be about 80 fewer tons
of emissions to the air during a typical summer day. About 3.7
million gallons of premium gas are sold on an average summer day in
the 10 areas.
   The gas costs about 2 cents more per gallon to produce than
other premium gasolines. Shell officials said the new gas is priced
the same as SU 2000, but they added the future price will be
determined by competitive conditions in the marketplace.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Rises for First Time in 11 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-month declining trend in Japan's trade
surplus halted in March, but economists said it was because the
month's imports were being compared with an unusually large amount
of imports in March 1989.
   The Finance Ministry on Thursday reported a surplus of $7.09
billion in March, up from $6.61 billion in March a year earlier. In
each of the 11 previous months, the surplus had been smaller than
the ones the prior year.
   In February, the surplus had fallen to $5.01 billion from $7.23
billion in February 1989.
   For Japan's fiscal year, which ended March 31, the surplus,
measured when goods pass through customs, fell to $59.7 billion
from $78.9 billion the prior year, the ministry reported.
   In trade with the United States, which has been pressing Japan
in a series of talks to narrow the imbalance, the March surplus
contracted to $3.77 billion from $4.01 billion in March 1989.
   For the fiscal year, Japan's sales to the United States exceeded
U.S. sales here by $42.8 billion, down 12.7 percent from the $49
billion surplus the year before.
   On a global basis, Japan's exports in March fell 1.8 percent
from the previous year to $26 billion, but imports declined 4.8
percent to $18.9 billion.
   In March 1989, imports had climbed nearly 30 percent from the
previous year, said Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist with
Sumitomo Bank. There was a surge of buying before Japan imposed a
new 3 percent sales tax last April 1, he said.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar's recent increase against the yen
makes Japan's exports, measured in dollars, appear bigger.
   In March, the Finance Ministry used exchange rates of about 148
yen to one dollar to calculate exports and imports, up from about
128 yen a year earlier.
   ``There's no big change in the downward trend'' of the Japanese
surplus, said Jan VanDenBerg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in
Tokyo.
   But she said that in coming months a combination of weaker
demand in Japan, stronger demand abroad and the weak yen will cause
Japan's trade surplus to begin expanding again.
   Kakimoto predicted a surplus of about $60 billion in the current
fiscal year, compared with $59.7 billion in fiscal 1989.

   Pennsylvania is ready to adopt the
nation's toughest anti-takeover law despite an outcry from the
nation's investment community and securities regulators.
   Lawmakers and Gov. Robert P. Casey are standing behind the
measure despite claims by fund managers that it will cut off
Pennsylvania companies from investment and that hostile takeovers
are dying out for lack of financing.
   ``The bill is an overreaction to a problem that is pretty much
in its final stages,'' said Charles M. LaLoggia, editor of
LaLoggia's Special Situation Report, a newsletter on takeover
stocks.
   ``It's sort of like the Keystone Kops arriving at the scene of a
crime about a month late,'' he added.
   The measure is supported by a labor-business coalition that says
it will protect the state's business and jobs from corporate
raiders.
   The bill likely will come to a final vote in the state Senate by
the end of April. It cleared the House April 3 by a 182-10 vote,
and the Senate approved an earlier version in December by 45-4.
Casey says he backs the bill.
   ``He is very strong in his support of legislation that would
prevent raids on Pennsylvania companies and jobs,'' said Casey's
spokesman, Vincent Carocci.
   Fund managers have lobbied against the bill since its
introduction last year, and they won a key ally last week in
Richard C. Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Breeden denounced the bill in an April 2 speech, saying it would
deny shareholders their rights and allow bad managers ``to run a
company into the ground.''
   He said Pennsylvania, Indiana and other states are trying to
``tilt the balance of corporate power in favor of corporate
management and against shareholders.''
   Hostile takeovers have cost Pennsylvania thousands of jobs and
the loss of such corporate mainstays as Gulf Oil Co., which closed
its Pittsburgh headquarters after it was merged with Chevron Oil.
The state ranks ranks fourth in the number of Fortune 500 company
headquarters.
   The AFL-CIO estimates about 90,000 jobs were lost around the
nation over the last decade because of mergers, takeovers and
leveraged buyouts.
   But LaLoggia said the market already is correcting past abuses.
   The excesses of corporate raiders have made it ``almost
impossible to raise money in the junk bond market and the banking
system for the type of leveraged buyout that caused companies to
get into trouble,'' he said.
   Those arguments hold little sway with the bill's sponsor, Sen.
Noah Wenger.
   ``This is precisely the time to move ahead,'' he said. The law
also will be a model for other states, Wenger adds.
   Pennsylvania already has some of the nation's toughest
anti-takeover laws. In 1983 and 1988, the state adopted measures to
block creeping tender offers, two-tiered offers and efforts to
squeeze out minority shareholders in order to finance takeovers
with corporation assets.
   The push for even stronger sanctions started after the Belzberg
family of Canada started buying into Armstrong World Industries
Inc., a Lancaster, Pa.-based building products manufacturer.
   The Belzbergs now own a 10.68 percent stake in the $2.5
billion-a-year company and are waging a proxy fight to elect four
candidates to the 14-member board at the company's April 30 annual
meeting.
   A key plank of the bill that has sent opponents into a frenzy is
a so-called disgorgement section.
   For the first time in the nation, the measure would require
corporate raiders to surrender profits earned by selling shares
within 18 months of making a takeover bid. Supporters say the
section will prevent the payment of greenmail, the practice of
buying back stock from a raider at an above-market price.
   Also under the bill, raiders who gain 20 percent or more of a
company would not get voting rights until approved by other
shareholders. Opponents contend this stipulation will make it
virtually impossible to wage proxy fights.
   The bill also would allow company directors to act in the
interest of the entire corporation and to consider interests other
than those of shareholders in assessing takeover offers. Such
interests could include a takeover's impact on employees, customers
or the community. Opponents say that would violate management's
fiduciary duty to stockholders.
   In provisions supported by organized labor, the bill spells out
that employees must be paid severance and that labor contracts must
be honored when corporate ownership changes hands.
   More than half the states have enacted takeover laws, but
Indiana is the only other state that allows managers to play down
shareholders' interests, said James E. Heard, managing director of
The Analysis Group, a Massachusetts-based financial consultant
retained by the Belzbergs.
   About half the states also have limited restrictions on voting
rights for acquisitions of large stakes, but they are not as broad
as those proposed for Pennsylvania, Heard added.

   Stocks were slightly lower at midday Thursday in
very light trading ahead of the four-day Easter holiday break.
   The thin volume exaggerated price changes, dealers said.
   They said they expected the market to drift for the rest of the
day as traders left for the long weekend. The market will be closed
for Good Friday and Easter Monday.
   There was little reaction to British economic data released
during the morning.
   Britain's annual inflation rate, as expected, jumped to 8.1
percent in March from 7.5 percent in February, largely because of
increases in mortgage rates, the government said.
   The unemployment rate, meanwhile, held steady at 5.6 percent in
March, it said.
   Shortly after midday in London, the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was down 1.1 points, or 0.05 percent, at
2,214.2.
   Volume at noontime was 211.1 million shares at midday, compared
with 190.9 million shares at the same time Wednesday.

   Mellon Bank completed its second automated
teller machine acquisition in the last five weeks by purchasing a
regional ATM network from Ameritrust Corp.
   Mellon's Network Services Division will perform automatic teller
processing for 19 financial institutions and their 171 machines in
the InstaNet network.
   The deal adds 650,000 to 700,000 transactions a month to its
current total of more than 11 million at about 350 institutions
nationwide.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
   Mellon ranks sixth among processors of electronic fund
transfers, according to Bank Network News, a Chicago-based
newsletter that monitors the industry.
   Ameritrust, one of Cleveland's largest banks, will continue to
own and process the transactions for its 270 machines, which it
calls the Asset network. Mellon also will serve as a link between
Asset and InstaNet.
   A. Jay Meyerson, executive vice president at Ameritrust, said
the bank decided to leave the regional automatic teller business
and concentrate on building its retail banking operations.
   Mellon decided to expand its automatic teller processing
business after selling its CashStream network of automatic tellers
two years ago.

<TEXT>
   Johnson &amp; Johnson says deteriorating
business conditions in Latin America are responsible for a $125
million charge against its first quarter earnings.
   The health care company Wednesday blamed the charge, being taken
to cover a number of separate actions, on severe economic turmoil,
inflation and high interest rates in certain Latin American
countries.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson said the loss includes the write-off and
restructuring of several subsidiaries, principally in Argentina. It
also provides for additional interest from the company's liquidated
Argentine debt.
   The charge also recognizes the impact of recent monetary
restrictions in Brazil, the company said.
   The new government of President Fernando Collor de Mello last
month imposed a package of economic measures designed to combat
hyperinflation. The plan's centerpiece _ a freeze on 80 percent of
the country's savings _ has dried up money in circulation and left
the country on the brink of recession.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson had revenue of $9.76 billion and net income of
$1.08 billion last year.
   The company said the charge will reduce earnings by 38 cents per
share. In the first quarter of 1989, the company earned $317
million or 95 cents a share on sales of $2.45 billion.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson said it will announce first-quarter results
April 26.

   Smithkline Beecham PLC said Thursday it has agreed
to sell its British-based Yardley-Lentheric Cosmetics business to
Old Bond Street Corp. of the United States for $180 million.
   Smithkline, the Anglo-American pharmaceutical group, said it has
obtained shareholder approval for the deal.
   But the agreement still requires both U.S. and British
regulatory approval, as well proof of financing by Old Bond Street,
a Smithkline spokesman said.
   Proceeds from the sale will go toward reducing Smithkline's
debt, the company said.
   The sale is part of Smithkline's strategy of focusing on its
core healthcare business following its creation last year through
the merger of Beecham Group PLC and Smithkline Beckman Corp.
   It is the first disposal of a cosmetics unit since the merger.
   Negotiations are underway with possible buyers of the remaining
cosmetics divisions, which include Yardley-Lentheric operations in
South Africa and the Smithkline Beecham Astor-Lancaster businesses
in continental Europe, the spokesman said. He wasn't identified, in
keeping with British practice.
   Old Bond Street, a holding company, plans to pay for the
cosmetics unit with a combination of cash and debt, Smithkline
said. Smithkline said it will hold a 10 percent stake in Old Bond
Street.
   Smithkline's spokesman said he didn't know when the deal might

   The stock market staged a moderate advance in
quiet preholiday trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.94 to 2,741.67
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 574 up, 362 down and
462 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.24 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders came into the session with low
expectations, given the market's recent sluggish behavior and the
approach of a long holiday weekend. The markets will be closed for
Good Friday.
   In that kind of environment, observers said, an absence of
selling pressure helped produce some pleasant surprises in the
price fluctuations of individual stocks.
   The government reported that retail sales dropped .06 percent in
March, in contrast to advance estimates of a small increase.
   That served as a new suggestion of continued sluggish, erratic
economic growth, along with possibly less upward pressure on
interest rates than has been feared of late.
   Ames Department Stores led the active list, down } at 1} on
reports that some manufacturers had stopped shipping merchandise to
the troubled retailer.
   Intel rose 1 to 43} in the over-the-counter market. The company
reported earnings for the quarter ended March 31 of 73 cents a
share, up from 52 cents in the like period a year earlier.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .52 to 188.09. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .10 at 357.44.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 1.35 to

   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the NYSE, with

<TEXT>
   Officials at Greyhound Lines Inc. say traffic
during the five-day Easter travel period will solidify the
company's financial position despite a 5-week-old, violence-marred
strike by bus drivers.
   Greyhound President Frank Schmieder said in an interview this
week that company projections indicate revenue will reach 70
percent to 73 percent of last year's Easter holiday travel period.
   He added that 73 percent of revenue is the break-even mark,
``and when we do that, we figure we've turned the corner.''
   ``They've been claiming they turned corners for the last six
weeks,'' said Jeffrey Nelson, spokesman for the Amalgamated Council
of Greyhound Local Unions.
   The company's 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 of its office and
maintenance workers walked out Marc 2 in an argument over wages and
job security. Greyhound has been operating a reduced schedule,
using permanent replacements and drivers willing to cross picket
lines.
   Greyhound has increased service in stages. Today, when the
company plans to add more than 100,000 miles, putting it at 459,685
miles, or 71.9 percent of pre-strike levels.
   Union officials claim Greyhound is operating only about 20
percent of its pre-strike routes.
   Negotiations to end the strike have been stalled since last
month. The company has refused to bargain until seven days have
passed without major violence. More than 30 shooting attacks have
been reported since the strike began.
   The company filed a $30 million federal lawsuit earlier this
week charging the union was behind the violence. The union claims
the company is using the violence as an excuse to avoid
negotiations.
   Authorities stopped three buses in northern Ohio on Wednesday
after a man called Greyhound's toll-free phone line claiming a bomb
was planted on a bus heading east from Chicago. No explosives were
found on the buses, said Thomas Johnston of the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office in Toledo.
   In Pittsburgh, a driver and passengers reported an explosion
aboard a bus bound for Washington, D.C. about 20 minutes after a
firecracker shattered a window at the Pittsburgh terminal. No one
was injured in either incident, said Kevin Fry, a Greyhound
spokesman in Dallas.
   The bus, carrying 31 passengers, was on Interstate 376 when
``both the driver and passengers heard and felt a vibration which
they took to be an explosion,'' Greyhound spokeswoman Bernadette
Barney said today. She said the bus returned to the station and
neither police nor the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms could immediately determine what caused the explosion,
which caused no damage to the bus.
   Two striking Greyhound drivers were ordered held without bond on
charges they fired shots at a bus last month just east of St. Louis.
   Through Easter, Greyhound is offering free tickets if its buses
are late in the busy Northeast, where service has been hardest hit.
Schmieder said the promotion had been taken up by 800 passengers
during the first five days of the offer.
   Passenger volumes nationwide totaled more than 56 percent of
last year's level, according to company figures.
   P. Anthony Lannie, Greyhound's executive vice president, said
the company should be serving 95 percent of its routes by summer.
Greyhound will have 3,200 drivers by May 1, but will need at least
1,000 more to meet summer demand, he said.
   While passenger traffic may be growing, the company is missing
out on money from its small package express business, which
accounted for about $92 million of Greyhound's $1.04 billion in
revenue last year.
   Schmieder said the package business is at about 45 percent of
year-earlier levels. Greyhound's charter operation, which last year
brought in $90 million, has been almost non-existent during the
strike. Despite the reductions in service, Greyhound is meeting its
bill payments, Schmieder said.

   Federal regulators arbitrarily devalued the
assests of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association by 50 percent
to 100 percent to justify their takeover of the institution, the
thrift's former owner contends.
   ``Without any analysis, they took the entire loan portfolio and
said it was non-performing,'' Phoenix financier Charles H. Keating
Jr. testified Wednesday in his suit to regain ownership of the
Irvine, Calif., S&amp;L.
   The devaluation of Lincoln's loans and extensive land, hotel and
stock holdings was ``absurd,'' Keating said in his fifth day on the
witness stand.
   A government document dated April 21, 1989, and introduced
Wednesday, lists ``assumptions used in the liquidating costing'' to
come up with a cost to taxpayers of $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion.
   He contended the document from regional regulators to the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board supports his claim that regulators
arbitrarily devalued Lincoln's assets to make it appear insolvent
to justify their seizing it.
   On Tuesday, Keating testified that, in his opinion, Lincoln had
a net worth of $500 million to $700 million when the government
seized it.
   The April 21 document was written one week after regulators
seized control of the $5.2 billion thrift under a conservatorship,
claiming that Keating was operating it in an unsafe and unsound
manner.
   It wasn't until five months later that regulators declared
Lincoln insolvent _ with liabilities to federally insured
depositors exceeding its assets by $153 million _ and took
ownership away from Keating under a receivership.
   Government attorneys repeatedly objected to Keating's comparison
of figures in the regulators' April 21 analysis with those provided
by the chief financial officer of his American Continental Corp.,
Lincoln's parent holding company.
   The objections were overruled by U.S. District Judge Stanley
Sporkin, who previously instructed the government attorneys to call
witnesses from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. _ Lincoln's
receiver _ to explain their reasoning behind the writedowns.
   ``This is something that has some meaning,'' said Sporkin, a
former accountant and once the top enforcement officer at the
Securities and Exchange Commission. ``The testimony here is that it
(the April 21 analysis) is pretty shoddy work. You don't write down
50 percent on a mortgage portfolio.''
   Robert Wurzelbacher, Keating's son-in-law who headed Lincoln's
real estate investments, likened the analysis to a family buying a
$100,000 home with a $20,000 down payment and an $80,000 loan.
   Then a regulator comes in and says the value of the loan and the
home is only $40,000, even though the monthly payments are still
being made, he said.
   The April 21 document estimated that the government could
recover only $2.1 billion to $2.5 billion from the sale of assets
that Lincoln was listing on its books as worth $5.2 billion when
regulators seized control.
   Assuring no losses to depositors would cost the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp., which has since been merged into the
FDIC, $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion, according to the analysis.
   Among the ``assumptions'' listed were that Lincoln's entire $1.4
billion portfolio of mortgage-backed real estate loans was
non-performing and in reality was worth only $703 million.
   It also estimated that $148 million in property that Lincoln had
repossessed under foreclosure could be sold for only $74 million
and that only $35.5 million of $71.1 million in non-mortgage
commercial loans could ever be recovered.
   In addition, the government said 75 percent or $533 million of
the $710 million that Lincoln invested through subsidiaries in
stock, hotels and various land holdings could never be recovered.
   Some assets were devalued by 100 percent, including long-term
leases and property improvements on Lincoln in Southern California
and some office equipment and furniture.
   Keating testified that 3 percent of the $1.4 billion in land and
real estate loans and less than 3 percent of the commercial loans
were more than 60 days in default when regulators seized Lincoln.
   All of the land and real estate loans, he said, were fully
secured with borrowers putting up an average 20 percent down
payment on the property.
   Lincoln's 20 percent ownership in the timber rights on 1.9
million acres of timberland in the Pacific Northwest and Louisiana
alone were valued at about $270 million, according to an analysis
by Merrill Lynch, Keating said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly
due to position-squaring by traders ahead of the three-day Easter
weekend beginning Friday.
   Analysts linked further selling to prospects for increased
soybean meal exports from Brazil, the world's second largest
soybean producer, as the South American soybean harvest approaches
50 percent.
   Another bearish factor was the Brazilian legislature's approval
of certain inflation-fighting measures that are expected to prompt
Brazilian farmers to sell more soybeans, analysts said.
   Brazil's government hopes to hold inflation to 5 percent this
month compared with more than 80 percent in March, which ``leaves
very little incentive for producers to hold onto inventory,'' said
William Biedermann, director of research at the commodities
brokerage Allendale Inc. in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   Weakness in the wheat market partly reflected reports of minimal
frost damage overnight to the winter wheat crop.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 1{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.63\ a bushel; corn was
{ cent to 1\ cents lower with May at $2.70 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to } cent lower with May at $1.51 a bushel; soybeans were
} cent to 1} cents lower with May at $5.91\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange with live cattle futures scaling back
after failing to surpass Wednesday's record high of 80.40 cents a
pound.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .12 cent lower with April at 80.32
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent lower to .10 cent higher
with April at 83.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower to
.28 cent higher with April at 55.90 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .15 cent to .55 cent higher with May at 58.20 cents a

   Cattle futures settled mixed on Wednesday while pork futures
were sharply higher.

Treasury bond, to be used towards your children's college education.
   B) Take a leave of absence from work and travel to Europe or
some other exotic destination.
   C) Buy gifts for all your family and friends.
   D) Buy a BMW or Mercedes to impress your neighbors.
   Felton-Collins says that if you answered ``A'' you would be
considered a Hedger, someone who is security conscious and afraid
to spend money.
   ``B'' means you're a Freewheeler, using money for freedom, to
buy choices and options.
   ``C'' means you're a Relator and tend to use money to enhance a
relationship.
   ``D'' means you're a Driver, someone who is power conscious and
interested in using money to influence others or make a statement.
   Felton-Collins says couples may possess a combination of these
traits, although she finds more women fall into the Hedger category
and men in the Driver.
   ``I'm finding more and more women, though, that are becoming
both hedgers and drivers,'' she says. ``Men tend to move from
driver to hedger as they get older...and then into freedom.''

   The stock market rallied in quiet preholiday
trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 21.62 to 2,751.35
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 809 up, 453 down and
529 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders came into the session with low
expectations, given the market's recent sluggish behavior and the
approach of a long holiday weekend. The markets will be closed for
Good Friday.
   In that kind of environment, observers said, an absence of
selling pressure helped produce some pleasant surprises in the
price fluctuations of individual stocks.
   The government reported that retail sales dropped .06 percent in
March, in contrast to advance estimates of a small increase.
   That served as a new suggestion of continued sluggish, erratic
economic growth, along with possibly less upward pressure on
interest rates than has been feared of late.
   Ames Department Stores led the active list, down 1 at 1{ on
reports that some manufacturers had stopped shipping merchandise to
the troubled retailer.
   Intel, one of the volume leaders in the over-the-counter market,
rose { to 43\. The company reported earnings for the quarter ended
March 31 of 73 cents a share, up from 52 cents in the like period a
year earlier.
   Among other strong technology issues, International Business
Machines gained 1{ to 107~ and Apple Computer added 1 to 43{ in OTC
trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
climbed 1.21 to 188.78. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .14 at 357.40.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 68.70 million shares at
noontime, against 72.86 million at the same point Wednesday.

<HEAD>Eli Lilly Discontinues Manufacture of 60 Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly and Co. has discontinued
manufacturing 60 products and versions of products, according to a
notification letter sent to drug wholesalers around the country.
   Representatives of several pharmaceutical wholesaling companies
said the products involved were either old or slow-selling and that
the manufacturing halts would have little or no financial impact on
them.
   ``It shouldn't cause an problems. Our buyers reacted to it as a
routine maintenance'' of Lilly's product line, said a spokesman for
Bergen Brunswig Corp., a California-based drug wholesaler.
   In the letter, dated March 26, Lilly told wholesalers to
continue to fill orders from their inventories and then, after
inventories were depleted, to classify them as ``manufacturer
discontinued.''
   Lilly said it knew of no other manufacturers for 10 of the
products, including two package sizes of 32 milligram Darvon
capsules. However, other dosage sizes of Darvon are available.
   In additions, some packaging formats of Axid, Lilly's anti-ulcer
drug, and of Keflex, an antibiotic, were discontinued, but Lilly
continues to manufacture those products in other formats.
   Several of the products discontinued were among those cited in
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's highly critical inspection
report on Lilly's manufacturing practices issued last year.
   Also discontinued two versions of Bacitracin ointment, an
over-the-counter antibiotic. According to the FDA, Lilly recalled
about 6,000 tubes of Bacitracin in February after testing showed
that the product might not retain its potency through its
expiration date.

   Energy futures prices mostly were higher in
see-saw trading today after breaking a weeklong slump with some
modest gains in the previous session.
   Prices had declined early in the session but recovered the day's
lost ground and more by midday.
   The erratic performance came in the wake of official
confirmation that OPEC oil ministers were considering calling an
emergency meeting to deal with conditions that have seen crude oil
futures prices fall 25 percent since January.
   Wednesday's gains came in one of the wildest sessions of the
year, as prices rocketed higher in the afternoon on speculation
that OPEC nations were considering calling an emergency meeting.
   Prices had fallen sharply to start Wednesday's session in what
analysts said reflected concerns about the huge supply of crude and
weak demand.
   In London today, OPEC's acting president, Sadek Boussena, said
OPEC oil ministers are considering various options, including
calling an emergency meeting, to try and stop the recent slide in
world oil prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange at midday, the May contract
for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
was up 9 cents at $18.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. It had been down 44 cents at midmorning after rising 38
cents on Wednesday.
   Among refined products traded on the Merc, the contract for May
delivery of unleaded gasoline was off 0.08 cent at 59.50 cents a
gallon, after rising 1.15 cents on Wednesday.
   May home heating oil was up 0.47 cent to 54.10 cents a gallon in
early trading, after rising 1.23 cents on Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, natural gas for June delivery was trading at $1.597
per million British thermal units, down from $1.605 on Wednesday.
   Analysts said the early price declines on Wednesday reflected
the American Petroleum Institute's report, released after the
market closed Tuesday, that U.S. crude oil inventories rose by a
larger-than-expected 8.1 million barrels last week.
   But prices rebounded sharply later in the session after rumors
circulated that OPEC nations were consulting by telephone and
considering calling an emergency meeting about the decline.
   Spokesmen for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
at the group's headquarters in Vienna said no meeting had been
planned.
   Analysts say OPEC has been producing more crude oil than the
market can absorb in recent weeks, causing prices to decline since
late January.
   It has been estimated that the OPEC nations have been producing
between 23.5 million and 24.1 million barrels a day of crude oil,
topping its self-imposed cap of 22.1 million barrels.
   ``The only thing that can turn this market around would be
OPEC,'' said James R. Fiedler, a vice president at E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc.
   Crude oil prices have plunged 25 percent since the near-month
contract for West Texas Intermediate reached $24.20 a barrel on
Jan. 22. The decline had accelerated in recent days, with the May
crude oil contract losing $1.47 a barrel in this week's first two
sessions alone, sinking to the lowest level for a near-month
contract since February 1989.
   Despite the big decline in crude futures, motorists haven't seen
lower prices at the pump.
   The national average price for a gallon of gasoline was $1.1331
a gallon on April 6, according to the latest Lundberg Survey of
13,000 gasoline stations nationwide. That compared with an average
$1.1306 on Jan. 19.
   Analysts say there often is a lag of a month to 45 days for
refined products to reflect movements in futures prices. In
addition, they say gasoline prices normally rise as the spring
driving season approaches, and refiners this year are incurring
extra costs in meeting tougher anti-smog regulations for their
products.
   Demand for crude oil normally falls off in the early spring, and
refineries often take the opportunity to close their plants for
maintenance.
   But this spring, inventories already were high because of an
unusually mild winter in Europe and the United States, according to
Bob Baker, who tracks the oil markets for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Demand also appears to be weaker than a year ago. Peter Beutel,
assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.,
estimated demand for gasoline is down 1.2 percent from a year ago
while demand for heating oil fell 8.5 percent.
   Part of the decline, Beutel said, may stem from a general
weakening in economic activity.

<HEAD>Is The Old Economic Buggy Breaking Down?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In one form or another you can perceive a
growing hope among Americans that whatever power it is that pushes
the economic pedals and levers knows what it is doing.
   The mutual concern, arising from consumers and producers,
employers and workers, academics and the man and woman about town
is that the economy is beginning to sound like an old, poorly
maintained car.
   There's a lot of coughing and sputtering to be heard, a good
deal of deterioration to be seen, and a sense that there isn't
enough wherewithal to replace the old buggy.
   Who's in charge?
   Theoretically, at least, economic policy is made up of fiscal
and monetary actions, the first being the responsibility of
Congress and the White House, the latter mainly being a function of
the Federal Reserve.
   Of the two, the impact of fiscal policy tends to be
slower-acting than monetary policy. It involves taxing, public
spending and budgets, for example, while monetary policy involves
money supply and interest rates.
   Interest rates remain fairly high by standards in comparable
times of the past three or four decades. Action by the Fed to lower
them could spur activity, but so far that body has not deemed such
action appropriate.
   Still, manufacturing is sluggish. The economic index by the
nation's purchasing managers association rose slightly in February,
but it remained below 50 for the 11th month in a row. Below 50
generally is seen as negative and portending contraction.
   Similarly, the jobless rate essentially was unchanged in March,
with the civilian unemployment rate remaining around 5.2 percent of
the labor force. It might have looked good in headlines, but finer
print didn't read well.
   Why did the jobless rate remain steady? Good weather, rather
than improving business, resulted in fewer layoffs. Federal
government hiring of census workers helped. It will help in April
too, when 200,000 will be added.
   But a disturbing story was contained in the March data. The
number of factory jobs declined by 30,000, bringing the
manufacturing job loss to about 100,000 since last November. Over a
year, such jobs are down by 250,000.
   Single-family home sales rose 3 percent in February, but that
report also wasn't as good as hoped for. The National Association
of Home Builders had expected mild weather and some mortgage rate
declines to produce better news.
   ``The year 1990 is stacking up as a weaker year than we expected
only a few months ago,'' said NAHB president Martin Perlman.
   Over the 12 months ended in February, the index of leading
economic indicators was down 1 percent, one of the worst
year-to-year reports since the mid-1980s. Consumer spending is
weak. Production readings too.
   Not easily measured, but certainly not adding to economic
confidence, are various news items, including the ever-worsening
savings and loan losses, poor real estate markets in some areas,
and the problems with junk bonds.
   Once upon a time _ many times _ the Federal government would
step in and throw money around like confetti to fuel greater
growth. But governments at all levels are hurting these days, and
they have little money to give.
   An apparently positive signal flashed a few days ago with
reports that U.S. companies would maintain their capital spending
programs for new plants and equipment, but that report is being
questioned because profits are falling.
   With effort, it often is possible to assemble a handbasket of
bad economic news like this and attempt to convince people that
things are going to Hades. But to do so in recent weeks takes no
effort at all.
   Perhaps the most optimistic aspect of the situation is that it
isn't new. Several times in the past few years the long economic
expansion seemed to be at an end. The old buggy coughed and
sputtered, but then it didn't expire.
   And now, with springtime here, maybe it can find a few more
miles in its worn machinery, especially if the Federal Reserve
greases the gears with a shot of lower interest rates.

<HEAD>Intel First-Quarter Income Jumps 48 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intel Corp. said Thursday its
first-quarter profit jumped 48 percent, due in part to increased
demand for the company's 32-bit computer microprocessors.
   Profit for the quarter ended March 31 totaled $144 million, or
73 cents a share, compared with $97 million, or 52 cents a share,
in the same period a year ago.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $894 million, up 25 percent from
$713 million in the same quarter last year.
   ``The transition to 32-bit (computer) architectures has picked
up momentum in the past six months,'' said Andrew S. Grove,
president and chief executive officer of the Santa Clara-based
company.
   Intel's new 386 and 486 microprocessors process information 32
bits at a time, rather than 16 bits under their original design. A
bit is the smallest piece of information used by a computer. The
increase expands microprocessor power, capabilities and speed, said
Intel spokeswoman Karen Nalley.
   Grove predicted continued market demand and growth for Intel
products in the current quarter.
   Intel has announced plans to upgrade or expand manufacturing
capacity at several of its plants, with capital expenditures for
the year estimated at $600 million.
   In December, the company announced it was phasing out its last
chip plant in Silicon Valley and moving production operations to
other locations such as Arizona, Oregon and New Mexico, where there
is more affordable housing.
   Intel also said last year it is spending $400 million to build a
plant near Dublin, Ireland.
   The company in January announced a joint venture with NMB
Semiconductor Ltd. of Japan to sell NMB's dynamic random-access
memory, or DRAM, chips worldwide on an exclusive basis.
   Intel used to manufacture DRAMs, a vital ingredient in many
electronic products, but quit in 1985 when Japanese companies
started making them in large quantities and selling them at low
prices.

<HEAD>Annual Meetings: Chance for Institutional Investors to Rock the
Boat</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The decline of hostile takeovers may have
restored a measure of calm to the boardrooms of U.S. corporations,
but that doesn't mean directors and managers are enjoying peace and
quiet.
   Their biggest shareholders, institutional investors such as
public-employee pension funds that once endorsed nearly everything
corporate executives said or did, have become increasingly vocal
and more demanding.
   They are increasingly sponsoring resolutions at annual meetings,
for example, on subjects ranging from shareholder proxy-voting
rights to policies on the environment and South Africa. Much to the
chagrin of top executives, some big investors have muscled their
way into corporate decision-making.
   ``We're seeing companies voluntarily agreeing to institute
confidentiality in proxy votes...(and) Occidental Petroleum agreed
to meet with institutional investors on an informal basis,'' Gray
Davis, California's comptroller and a trustee of the state's public
employee pension funds, said in citing examples of the
institutions' evolving power.
   Perhaps the biggest coup scored by institutional investors came
last month at Lockheed Corp.'s annual meeting, when the big
stockholders forced management to make some substantial concessions
or risk losing their support in a proxy vote instigated by
dissident investor Harold Simmons.
   Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep met with 70 institutions in his
defense against Simmons' campaign to unseat his company's board.
Among the concessions Tellep made was an agreement to name up to
three Lockheed directors to represent institutional shareholders.
   ``He convinced me that he has finally got religion,'' Davis said
of Tellep. ``He said the last three months of his life have been
the most educational of his career.''
   Davis said the institutions' victory with Lockheed will open
doors at other corporations that sell stock to the public.
``Management is increasingly affording institutional investors an
opportunity to make constructive suggestions,'' he said.
   Institutional investors are trying to do what any investor wants
to do, make a profit. The price of the stock they hold must be at
or above a certain level, or the value of assets needed to fund
thousands of pensions will fall.
   For example, if a pension fund held 1 million shares of a
company's stock and the stock fell $10 million over the course of a
year, the fund's assets would be worth $10 million less than a year
earlier. That means there's less money to fund retirees' pensions.
   Lockheed's stock reached a high of $54.75 a share during the
last 12 months, but fell to $36.62{ by March 29, the day of the
company's annual meeting. For California Public Employees'
Retirement System _ one of the funds of which Davis is a trustee _
the $18-a-share drop meant a decline of more than $9 million in its
assets.
   The stocks of other defense contractors also have fallen
recently, but the institutions and other shareholders _ including
Simmons _ have been dissatisfied with the company's management and
linked its policies directly to the decline in Lockheed's stock
price.
   If they're so unhappy, why don't they just sell their stock?
   They can't _ at least, not in one fell swoop. With their massive
holdings, institutions can't unload an underperforming stock
without affecting the rest of the market.
   Recently, the California, New York City and Massachusetts
pension funds jointly sought assurances from Exxon Corp. that the
oil giant would protect its earnings _ and therefore its stock
price _ by taking steps to prevent another disaster like last
year's Exxon Valdez spill. The funds said they approached the
company because they couldn't just dump their combined holdings of
14 million Exxon shares.
   Todd Lang, a partner with the law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges,
said institutions are more active because they are forced to hold
onto their shares.
   Institutional investors have ``a responsibility to their
beneficiaries to seek changes or to vote independently...so they
develop voting positions on everything,'' Lang said.
   Many big companies have resisted institutions' attempts to take
a larger role in corporate governance. When the California public
employees fund and the New York State and Local Retirement System
recently asked General Motors Corp. for updates on the search for a
successor to retiring chairman Roger Smith, for example, they were
told to butt out.
   ``Corporate governance, which includes the selection of
officers, is the board's responsibility,'' GM said in a statement.
   Last year, Exxon named an environmentalist to its board in
response to a request by New York City's employee pension fund. But
the request came less than two months after the Exxon Valdez
accident. The oil company, fighting criticism about its
environmental record, was in no position to refuse.
   Despite the institutions' recent gains, some pension fund
executives say there is still much work to be done.
   Roland M. Machold, director of New Jersey's Investment Division,
sees institutional holders as largely powerless although they hold
40 percent to 50 percent of all outstanding stock.
   He attributed much of the successes institutional holders had
with Lockheed to the threat generated by Simmons, one of the few
takeover strategists who has remained relatively active in recent
months.
   ``Certainly we have made our presence known, but companies have
tried to close the door on shareholder activity,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, investor relations consultants are warning
management that institutional investors will be rocking the boat
harder, and told them this will be increasingly evident at annual
meetings. Dale Gerboth, a partner at the accounting and consulting
firm Ernst &amp; Young told companies recently, ``Institutional
investors are acting more like owners.''
   Machold and Davis are two of three co-chairmen of the Council of
Institutional Investors, an association of employee benefit plans;
state and local agencies that oversee such plans; and
not-for-profit foundations and endowments. The council has become
an advocate for shareholder rights in the belief that more powerful
investors can help effect changes that will benefit all
stockholders.
   The council backs a set of proposals known as the Shareholders
Bill of Rights, which among other things includes the principle of
one-share, one-vote and calls for shareholders to have a voice in
matters that would have significant financial impact on a company.
   Institutional investors are also opposing some classic takeover
defenses, including anti-takeover laws and ``poison pill'' plans,
which could limit their ability to receive a higher price for their
shares in a buyout.
   Some have actively pressured companies to rescind corporate
policies that award multimillion dollar ``golden parachute''
severance packages to executives if they're dismissed.
   California's funds have also been active on their own,
submitting to the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed
revisions on proxy solicitation rules.
   ``We believe shareholders and employees should be afforded the
opportunity to make constructive suggestions to management. The
proxy rules as presently constituted don't really afford
shareholders that opportunity,'' Davis said.
   ``Our goal is a more level playing field,'' he said. ``Under
current law, management has the upper hand.''

   President Bush and his wife, Barbara, reported
$208,274 last year from business holdings kept in a blind trust and
paid total federal income taxes of $101,382, according to a copy of
the first family's tax return released today.
   The Bushes reported a total gross adjusted income of $456,780
for the year, which includes the income from the blind trust and
Bush's government salary of $189,167.
   The job of president pays $200,000 a year, but Bush was only
president for just over 11 months and vice president for 20 days in
1989.
   The joint tax return filed by the president and his wife listed
$94,702 in itemized deductions.
   Among the contributions was $3,000 in cash for relief
organizations to help victims of Hurricane Hugo in the Virgin
Island and another $1,500 for similar efforts in the aftermath of
the San Francisco-area earthquake.
   Bush also reported profits of $14,282 in 1989 on his campaign
biography, ``Looking Forward.'' He divided all the proceeds between
two charities: the United Negro College Fund in New York and the
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center of Houston.
   The Bush's paid taxes equivalent to 22.2 percent of their total
income.
   In addition to his rise in slary in going from the job of vice
president to the presidency, the blind trust Bush set up in 1981
when he became vice president showed a profitable year.
   The $208,274 in interest and dividend earnings through
partnerships and other ventures, masked by the blind trust, was up
from $155,662 reported in the previous year.
   Meanwhile, Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife, Marilyn,
reported that they paid total taxes of $25,479 on adjusted gross
income of $133,696. Most of the income consisted of Quayle's
government salary _ $106,528 as vice president and $3,715 in
January 1989 during the governmental transition period.
   The Quayles reported $14,572 in dividend earnings in 1989 on
stock holdings in Central Newspapers Inc.
   Bush, who has lobbied long and hard for a reduction on the
capital gains tax, wound up paying taxes on a long-term capital
gain of $36,068. In his income bracket the capital gains tax is 28
percent; under his proposal it would be just under 20 percent.
   The gain was reported by the blind trust, therefore the nature
of it was not revealed. The capital gains tax applies to profits
from the sale of stock, real estate or other assets.
   Overall, the Bushes claimed $94,702 in itemized deductions,
including the $37,272 they gave in contributions to 39 charities.
The blind trust also gave $594 to unspecified charities.
   Like many Americans, the amount withheld from Bush's paycheck _
and quarterly payments to the Internal Revenue Service _ didn't
quite cover the tax bill. So the Bushes had to send off a check to
the IRS regional office in Philadelphia of $3,228.

   The stock market headed higher in quiet
preholiday trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 24.32 to 2,754.05
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 848 up, 539 down and
524 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders came into the session with low
expectations, given the market's recent sluggish behavior and the
approach of a long holiday weekend. The markets will be closed for
Good Friday.
   In that kind of environment, observers said, an absence of
selling pressure helped produce some pleasant surprises in the
price fluctuations of individual stocks.
   The government reported that retail sales dropped .06 percent in
March, in contrast to advance estimates of a small increase.
   That served as a new suggestion of continued sluggish, erratic
economic growth, along with possibly less upward pressure on
interest rates than has been feared of late.
   Ames Department Stores led the active list, down ~ at 1| on
reports that some manufacturers had stopped shipping merchandise to
the troubled retailer.
   Intel, one of the volume leaders in the over-the-counter market,
rose { to 43\. The company reported earnings for the quarter ended
March 31 of 73 cents a share, up from 52 cents in the like period a
year earlier.
   Chemical Banking, which also posted higher quarterly profits,
gained 1&lsqb; to 24{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
climbed 1.23 to 188.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .15 at 357.69.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 101.47 million shares with two
hours to go.

   Matt Fisher is the family risk taker, known to delay paying the
electric bill until the ``disconnect notice'' comes, while his wife
Barbara is a virtuoso at balancing the checkbook.
   Fisher, 34, feels reasonably comfortable with things like
corporate bonds or growth stocks. Mrs. Fisher, 42, gets uneasy at
the mention of those words.
   Still, the Jacksonville, Fla., couple, who recently opened a
hair-replacement business, mix love and money successfully. They
keep half their $200,000 investment portfolio in stocks and bonds
and the rest in short-term certificates of deposit or money market
accounts. Neither makes an investment decision without the other,
they say.
   For every couple like the Fishers, however, there are several
more that fail to jointly plan or even discuss important personal
financial matters. Experts say part of the problem is that a large
number of women have been slow in gaining equality in the home when
it comes to money.
   Even though women have emerged from the Money Decade of the '80s
as the fastest growing part of the work force, their role in
shaping the family's financial future remains stuck in a bygone
world, some investment planners say.
   ``Women are still in a very transitional role in which a man
makes the investment decisions,'' said Marilyn Cohen, a principal
of Capital Insight Inc. of Beverly Hills, Calif. ``I don't find the
young urban professional woman any more interested in money and
investing than her mother who had a traditional housewife role. I
find it very distressing.''
   Michael Stein, a financial planner with Brownson Rehmus &amp;
Foxworth in Chicago, said he also has encountered apathy in many of
the working women among his married clients, largely comprised of
wealthy, middle-aged executives.
   While the wives may be more likely to manage day-to-day family
finances, like balancing the checkbook and paying household bills,
the husbands usually have the upper hand in making the major
financial decisions, he said.
   ``Often where you have two executive units...the husband still
tends to be the dominant one,'' Stein said. ``A dominating woman is
the exception more than the rule.''
   Not surprisingly, couples' financial concerns vary with age.
Investment counselors say a younger couple likely will be more
concerned with making house payments and accumulating wealth than a
middle-aged pair, which is starting to think about retirement or
paying off a child's college loan.
   Victoria Felton-Collins, a financial planner and psychologist
with offices in California, said money values start between the
ages of 4 and 12. Many Americans, she said, have trouble shedding
the traditional male-female roles ingrained in their past
regardless of economic changes.
   ``Both men and women are, in fact, perpetuating this,'' said
Felton-Collins, who wrote the recently published book ``Couples &amp;
Money.''
   ``I've seen very successful women who go home and turn their
paychecks over to their husbands. They may manage millions of
dollars for their companies but when they get home it's a different
story.''
   That relationship, however, is slowly changing as women continue
to enter the work force and gain greater financial confidence.
Felton-Collins said she expects that to continue through the '90s.
   ``Maybe it's going to take another generation _ the daughters of
these young urban professional women,'' said Cohen.``They see their
working mothers bringing home paychecks.''
   About 60 percent of all women of working age are employed
outside the home, and by the year 2000 women are expected to
comprise about half of the nation's total work force.
   Full-time women workers are making more than they once did and
some nearly bring home as much as their spouses. Still, only one in
six married women working full-time brings home more money than her
husband, a figure that has remained constant for a decade. Census
Bureau figures show that on average, women still only earn about 65
percent of their husband's income.
   Eileen Sharkey, who runs the Denver financial planning service
Sharkey &amp; Associates Inc., said that in her practice she has seen
more women taking an active role in finances over the past 10 years.
   But she said, ``I don't think there's ever going to be equality
in terms of interest. There will always be men who won't give up
the checkbook and women who won't give up tennis ... and the other
way around.''
   Often, it's not until death or divorce that women take a more
active role in their financial future, said Jan Warner, a Columbia,
S.C., lawyer who runs SoloSource Inc., a service that counsels
divorced women on financial options.
   Warner estimates that three-quarters of his female clients, most
of whom are age 40 or older, come to him without the financial
know-how needed to make it alone comfortably.
   ``The average person that comes to us has been the victim of the
demise of a 15-to 20-year-old marriage with no business acumen
because she has relied on someone else to do it,'' he said. ``And
we deal with some pretty good business women.''
   Mary Lynn, 47, a real estate broker from Cleveland, fits into
that category. Recently divorced from her husband of 24 years, she
has crammed to learn enough about investment matters to make it on
her own.
   The woman, who asked not to be identified by her full married
name, said she expected to receive between $50,000 and $60,000 once
the family house is sold. She's looking for investments.
   ``He (the ex-husband) just basically did all the decision making
where money was concerned,'' she said. ``I guess that was one of
the sore spots. He never really asked or consulted me.''
   Stein, the financial planner, said that wives of breadwinners,
no matter how stable their marriages might seem, should try to
garner some financial independence. He suggested they establish
credit and accummulate assets solely in their own name, since their
husbands likely are doing just that through their own company
retirement plans.
   ``Money and the inability to discuss it openly and honestly
causes more damn problems than anything else,'' said Hank Madden, a
financial planner with IDS Financial Services Inc.'s Jacksonville,
Fla., office, who has been advising the Fishers.
   He said the hair-replacement entrepreneurs stand out among his
clients because each would be prepared to make an investment
decision individually. Still, he said, the financial philosophies
of the Fishers appear to reflect some sexual stereotypes.
   Men, for example, are more likely to be risk-takers, while women
tend to be a bit more conservative and accountable.
   ``Barbara is my conscience. She is more frugal,'' Fisher said of
his wife.
   ``I'm concerned with losing money; that's my biggest fear,''
said Mrs. Fisher. ``He has a more in-depth grip on what's
happening. He would come home and tell me about whatever he's
interested in and we would make a decision together.''

<HEAD>Group Plans Takeover Effort for Close-out Retail Chain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former lieutenant of T. Boone Pickens is
leading an investment group that has bought 6.6 percent of the
stock of Pic `N' Save Corp. and plans a takeover bid for the
close-out retail chain.
   The investment group, Girard Partners, disclosed in a filing
Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it paid
$25 million for the stock. The filing said the group will seek
control of Pic `N' Save's board.
   William M. Jacobs Jr., Pic `N' Save's senior vice president and
chief financial officer, said company officials would have no
comment until studying the SEC filing.
   Girard Partners is led by David H. Batchelder, who served as
Pickens' chief strategist until 1988. Another member of the group
is Robert H. McNulty, president and chief executive of the HQ
Office Supplies Warehouse retail chain and a founder of the Home
Club chain.
   There is speculation that the investors may plan to overhaul Pic
`N' Save, which faces tough competition and has little attractive
real estate or other assets, according to Sarah Stack, a retail
analyst with the Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. brokerage in
Los Angeles.
   ``Management is at risk,'' Ms. Stack said. She note that
institutional investors hold about 69 percent of Pic `N' Save's
stock while just 3 percent is held by management.
   Pic `N' Save, based in the Dominguez suburb of Los Angeles, had
about $400 million in sales last year and employs about 5,000
people. It buys manufacturers' close-out merchandise and sells it
at discounts to customers.

<HEAD>March Sales at Chain Stores Fair to Poor; Improvement Seen for
April</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

   This year's later Easter and lackluster business conditions made
March a mediocre month for many of the nation's major chain stores,
retailers reported Thursday.
   Store executives and retail economists said April should turn
out to be a better month for business as holiday promotions
capitalize on a seasonal upsurge in demand for spring clothing and
other merchandise.
   The retailers' March results varied. Some big chains had
stronger-than-expected sales. Management at some companies asserted
that sales actually were quite good considering they missed out on
pre-Easter business.
   Rosalind Wells, chief economist at the National Retail
Federation in New York, said, ``stores are looking forward to a
successful Easter sales period in April'' after an encouraging
March.
   Last month's sales were compared with March 1989, when stores
drew customers because of holiday promotions pushing everything
from spring clothing to candy. Easter fell on March 26 last year.
   The largest chain reporting Thursday was K mart Corp., which
blamed the calendar shift for its so-so showing.
   The Troy, Mich.-based discounter, which ranked second in
nationwide sales volume last year behind Sears, Roebuck and Co.,
said its total sales for the five weeks ended April 4 rose 8.6
percent. But sales fell 1.1 percent at stores open at least a year.
   Results from stores open a year or longer give a more accurate
reading on a retailer's performance. These same-store, or
comparable-store, results exclude sales at new outlets, which
sometimes are inflated temporarily by the hoopla of store openings.
   ``Sales were strong in the first two weeks of March but, because
of the later date for Easter in 1990 than in 1989, sales weakened
in line with expectations in the latter part of the month,'' said K
mart Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph E. Antonini.
   Several major mass merchandisers, such as Sears, Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and others, already posted their March
sales a week ago. Overall, those results were sluggish. The
exceptions were the perennial star performer Wal-Mart and stores
concentrating on apparel, including Penney.
   Apparel-oriented retailers have almost consistently outpaced
general merchandise chains that devote much of their business to
costly durable goods for more than a year. Subpar economic growth _
with workers in some industries worried about layoffs _ have made
consumers cautious about spending heavily or going into debt to
finance expensive purchases.
   The government's more comprehensive retail sales report, also
issued Thursday, illustrated how a weak economy has flashed warning
signals to consumers. Outlays have been curbed by the Federal
Reserve Board's high interest rate policy aimed at diffusing
inflationary pressures.
   The Commerce Department said retail sales fell a seasonally
adjusted 0.6 percent in March from February. The report covered
sales at a wide range of establishments including stores, auto
dealerships, restaurants and elsewhere.
   Still, some stores have managed to prosper.
   ``I think overall the companies that have been doing well in the
past continue to improve market share in a very challenging
environment,'' said retail analyst Richard Pyle at Piper Jaffrey &amp;
Hopwood in Minneapolis. ``It does appear that the shoppers are
willing to spend if the merchants have the right merchandise.''
   Dayton Hudson Corp., the Minneapolis-based owner of the Target
discount chain and Mervyn's department stores, did well in March.
Companywide sales rose 14.9 percent in the five weeks ended April 7
while sales at stores open at least a year gained 8.2 percent.
   May Department Stores Co. posted a 7.5 percent increase in sales
over a year earlier. The St. Louis-based chain, which operates Lord
&amp; Taylor and numerous other well-known retail names, reported the
results from continuing operations only. Its same-store sales were
up only 2.7 percent.
   Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. said weakness
in women's and children's apparel as well as in shoes contributed
to a 1.9 percent sales drop overall and a 2.4 percent on a
comparable store basis.
   Among stores selling exclusively apparel, The Limited Inc. said
its sales rose 8 percent but rose a more modest 4 percent on a
comparable store basis.
   Analysts said the sales gains for the Limited, which has its
headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, were lower than in many past months
because sales were compared with March 1989's robust results.
   Another apparel specialty chain, The Gap Inc., posted a 20
percent jump in March sales. Same-store sales rose 12 percent.

<TEXT>
   Record casino gambling profits
pushed quarterly earnings up 92 percent at Hilton Hotels Corp.,
which took itself off the auction block in March because of
disappointing low offers.
   ``The Las Vegas Hilton results last year were abnormally low,
but the improvement there and at the Flamingo Hilton-Las Vegas are
positive considering the recent capacity expansion along the Las
Vegas Strip,'' said Hilton's chairman, Barron Hilton.
   During its first quarter, which ended March 31, Hilton had net
income of $25.1 million, or 52 cents per share, compared with $13.1
million, or 27 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.
Revenue rose by 18 percent, from $225.1 million to $265.5 million.
   Hotel income was up 8 percent at $22.8 million, Hilton said. But
it was in the gaming segment where profits rocketedby 119 percent
to $33.8 million, the highest level in the company's history,
Hilton said.
   The company had held discussions with nearly a dozen potential
buyers before its board of directors voted to take down the ``for
sale'' sign after rejecting two final bids worth nearly $3.8
billion each.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The New York Times Co. said Thursday its
first-quarter profit fell 50.4 percent, citing lower advertising
linage at its flagship newspaper, an operating loss at its magazine
group, costs associated with a new printing plant and weaker
results from its forest products investment.
   The company said it earned $16.6 million, or 22 cents a share,
in the three months ended March 31 compared with $33.5 million, or
42 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The 1989 results included $2 million from cable operations that
have since been sold.
   First-quarter revenue rose 1.9 percent to $431.2 million from
$423.1 million a year earlier.
   Operating profit at the company's newspaper group, which
includes The New York Times, 35 regional newspapers and a one-third
interest in The International Herald Tribune, fell to $38.4 million
from $55.9 million a year earlier.
   The company said the main reason was an 11.8 percent decline in
ad linage at The New York Times because of the continuing weakeness
in the New York region's economy. About 75 percent of the decline
in linage was in the help-wanted and real estate classifications,
which are sensitive to economic conditions.
   ``Our strong business franchises and our recent investments
position us for renewed growth when the economy of the New York
region improves,'' said Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and chief
executive.
   The company's magazine group posted an operating loss of $3.8
million in contrast to an operating profit of $700,000 in first
quarter 1989.
   The loss resulted primarily from costs associated with the July
1989 acquisition of McCall's magazine.
   The company said increased depreciation and interest expense
associated with completion of a new automated color production and
distribution facility in Edison, N.J., and a new facility for the
Gwinnett (Ga.) Daily News also depressed its latest results.
   The company's equity in earnings after taxes from its forest
products group fell to $30,000 from $3.6 million a year ago as a
result of price discounting in the newsprint market.
   Operating profit from its broadcasting and information services
operations was steady.

<HEAD>KKR, Nabisco Mull Bonds Due In 2007</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the junk bonds that financed the
megatakeover of RJR Nabisco Inc. are due in 2007, but recent
gyrations in prices of the volatile bonds indicate how speculators
are betting on the company's chances of paying them off.
   Earlier this week some high-yield Nabisco issues rose as much as
4{ points, or about $45 per $1,000 in face value, before easing
Thursday as investors cashed in gains.
   Although Nabisco is considered one of the less risky issues in
the market for high-yield debt, its bonds have been volatile for
months.
   Traders recently have focused on rumors that Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co., which bought Nabisco last year for a record $24.53
billion, might be buying up an issue of bonds to avoid having to
pay sharply higher interest on them next year.
   But others say the bond price jump reflects anticipation of a
favorable first-quarter earnings report for the tobacco and
consumer products giant.
   Nabsico's first quarter earnings, due out later this month, are
expected to show a marked improvement over the previous quarter,
when the company lost $144 million. Nabisco lost $1.15 billion for
all of 1989, but had positive cash flow of $647 million after all
interest payments were made.
   ``If the market gets some feeling that the company is doing a
great job, then the bonds will go up and react more like stocks''
to the news, said Jack Maxwell, an analyst at Wheat First
Securities in Richmond, Va.
   Both Nabisco and KKR have a keen interest in seeing the bonds
trade at high prices.
   Although the bulk of bonds _ about $4.5 billion worth _ don't
mature until 2007, their interest rate must be ``reset'' in April
1991, or adjusted to restore the bond price to face value.
   Bond prices move inversely to their interest rates, so the lower
the price of the RJR Nabisco bonds, the higher the interest rate
the company must offer at the reset. Some market watchers
speculate, for example, that the rate on RJR's 13.71 percent
convertible bonds due in 2007 might have to be reset at 20 percent
or more.
   Rumors circulating in the marketplace indicate KKR might be in
the process of buying back $2 billion of bonds due in 2009 that are
convertible to stock.
   Analysts say such a move not only would increase KKR's stake in
Nabisco, but also likely would help boost the value of other
outstanding Nabisco junk bonds _ helping cut the potential reset
interest rate.
   Spokespeople for both KKR and Nabisco had no comment Thursday on
the rumors.
   ``It's not the first time KKR has been rumored to be buying the
bonds,'' said Joan Greenberg, senior vice president at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. But ``we saw greater (price) movement this time,''
she said.
   Despite the recent upturn in prices, some believe it hasn't been
enough to allay Nabisco's and KKR's concerns.
   ``When you face a reset, the main problem is ... the interest
expense might be too much for a company to bear,'' said Robert
Waill, a vice president at the Stamford Co., a Manhattan-based
investment management firm. ``You can be assured that the KKR
people are thinking about his problem.''
   But Wheat First's Maxwell believes the time ahead of the reset
date will help Nabisco. If positive fundamental data emerges on the
company and the bond prices rise, ``the less you have to worry
about them and the more people (there will be) buying them,'' he
said.
   Maxwell said the Nabisco bonds suffered from the demise of
junk-bond pioneer Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the once-powerful
investment house that collapsed in February and has been in
liquidation.
   Plunging prices forced managers of junk bond portfolios to sell
some better-quality, marketable securities such as RJR Nabisco
after Drexel left the scene as the sole market-maker in a number of
low-quality junk bonds.
   ``The couldn't sell the real junk because there was no market,
but there's an actual market in RJR junk,'' Maxwell said.

   The stock market rallied in quiet preholiday
trading today, pulling out of its recent holding pattern.
   Analysts said traders came into the session with low
expectations, given the market's recent sluggish behavior and the
approach of a long holiday weekend. The markets will be closed for
Good Friday.
   In that kind of environment, observers said, an absence of
selling pressure helped produce some pleasant surprises in the
price fluctuations of individual stocks.
   The government reported that retail sales dropped .06 percent in
March, in contrast to advance estimates of a small increase.
   That served as a new suggestion of sluggish, erratic economic
growth, along with possibly less upward pressure on interest rates
than has been feared of late.

<HEAD>Chemical Posts 1st Qtr Gain On Asset Sales; Bank of NY Income Flat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical Banking Corp. on Thursday posted a 29 percent rise in
its first quarter profit from a year earlier due largely to the
sale of its interest in Florida National Banks, while Bank of New
York Corp. reported flat earnings.
   Both of the major banking companies said problem loans, led by
debt to Third World countries, continued pressuring their results.
Analysts said the results generally were in line with expectations.
   Meanwhile, Chemical continued to downplay criticism of its
credit position, calling ``inappropriate'' the slight downgrading
Thursday of some of its debt and preferred stock by the rating
service Fitch Investors Service of New York.
   Chemical said its first quarter profit totaled $151.7 million,
or $1.55 per share, compared with earnings of $117.9 million, or
$1.49 a share, in 1989.
   This year's results included a pre-tax charge of $52 million for
a previously announced restructuring and a pre-tax gain of $115
million from the recent sale of its investment in Florida National
Banks of Florida Inc.
   Bank of New York, which merged with Irving Bank Corp. in a $1
billion deal a year ago, said it netted $102.3 million during the
period, up 1 percent from $101.05 million a year ago. Earnings per
share remained unchanged at $1.37.
   The company said earnings were hurt by a $17.5 million addition
to its loan-loss allowance. The provision for the quarter rose to
$63 million from $46 million.
   During the quarter, Bank of New York reduced its medium-term
loans to less developed countries to $552 million, resulting in
charge-offs of $207 million. Most of Bank of New York's Third World
debt portfolio was inherited from Irving.
   Chemical said lower interest income on medium- and long-term
loans to Brazil and Mexico helped depress its net interest income
for the quarter, to $482.4 million from $549.2 million last year.
   Total non-performing assets declined by $265 million to $3.24
billion for the entire company. At Chemical's Texas Commerce
Bancshare Inc. subsidiary non-performing assets, including problem
real estate loans, fell by $222 million from a year earlier.
   Chemical's provision for loan losses was $70 million, compared
with $90.7 million in the year-earlier quarter.
   ``Their asset quality is getting better,'' said James J.
McDermott Jr., a banking analyst with Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods in New
York.
   Other analysts took a dimmer view.
   ``They look weak to me when you take out the unusual items,''
Stephen Berman, an analyst with County Securities USA, said of
Chemical's net results.
   Chemical said non-interest income rose to $445.7 million from
$330.8 million. But without a $114.7 million pre-tax gain on the
sale of its holdings of common stock warrants of Florida National
Banks, income in that category would have been flat, it said.
   Chemical also said its non-interest expense rose, to $688
million from $642 million, largely due to a $52.3 million charge
for restructuring to reduce operating expenses. Without the charge,
non-interest expenses would have declined 8.7 percent, the company
said.
   Chemical's earnings report coincided with Fitch's announcement
that it lowered its rating on about $540 million of the company's
debt, including its senior notes, debentures, floating rate notes,
and $200 million of preferred stock.
   The ratings, which affect the company's borrowing costs, still
are considered investment grade. Furthermore, Fitch is only one of
several debt rating services, which include industry giants Moody's
Investors Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Fitch said its downgradings reflecting a weakening real estate
market in the Northeast, Chemical's primary lending market.
   Chemical Chief Financial Officer Joseph G. Sponholz called the
action ``inappropriate ... given the steps taken to strengthen our
balance sheet and the pattern of continuing improvement in the
corporation's credit quality.
   Bank of New York, which released its results at its annual
shareholders meeting, said its net interest income rose 8 percent
to $351 million. Non-interest income was $233 million, unchanged
from a year ago, while non-interest expense declined to $335.5
million from $342.7 million, due to savings realized from the
Irving merger.
   Chairman J. Carter Bacot told shareholders, ``We're very
delighted with the way the merger has gone.'' The merger expected
to be completed by year's end.

   Soybean futures prices
closed moderately lower Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting increasing harvest pressure from Brazil, while grain
futures ended mixed in subdued, pre-holiday trading.
   The grain markets will be closed on Good Friday.
   The soybean harvest in Brazil, the world's second-largest
soybean producer and exporter, was 37 percent complete at the end
of last week and is expected to advance more rapidly due to
clearing weather, analysts said.
   ``They could very easily be at the halfway point by the middle
of next week,'' said Joel Karlin, a grain analyst in Chicago with
Research Department Inc., a brokers' advisory service.
   Exports of Brazilian soybeans and soybean meal are also expected
to rise now that the Brazilian government has clarifed some of the
inflation-fighting measures that had held up shipments of goods
from the South American nation since last month.
   Sales of corn futures Thursday by commercial grain dealers could
indicate the Soviet Union has filled its needs for the present with
purchases of more than 1.5 million metric tons of U.S. corn during
the past week, Karlin said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 2\ cents higher
with May at $3.67 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with
May at $2.69} a bushel; oats were } cent to 1{ cents lower with May

   Energy futures closed mostly lower Thursday as
the oil markets finished a hectic holiday-shortened week dominated
by selling.
   The contract for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, pulled back by 28 cents to
settle at $17.78 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The loss wiped out much of Wednesday's 38 cent-gain that came
after a wild session of ups and downs. Later crude oil contracts
also declined Thursday, but by smaller amounts.
   Among refined products traded on the Merc, the contract for May
delivery of unleaded gasoline dropped 1.03 cents to 58.55 cents a
gallon, erasing most of Wednesday's increase of 1.15 cents. Other
contract months also fell.
   May home heating oil, however, rose 0.20 cent to 53.83 cents a
gallon, after advancing 1.23 cents on Wednesday. Contracts for
delivery during June, July and August posted losses ranging from
0.67 cent to 0.98 cent.
   Meanwhile, natural gas for June delivery settled at $1.598 per
million British thermal units, down from $1.605 on Wednesday.
Contracts for late delivery were mixed.
   Energy analysts said trading was heavy. Commercial operators,
such as oil companies, as well as smaller traders were said to be
active in the market.
   U.S. and European markets will be closed Friday ahead of Easter
Sunday. Markets in Europe will remain closed on Easter Monday and
reopen Tuesday, while U.S. markets will be open Monday.
   Oil futures came under strong selling pressure this week as
concern about abundant supplies overhanging world markets
intensified.
   ``The overall trend is still down,'' said a trader at Merrill
Lynch Energy Futures who spoke on condition that his name not be
used. ``Today we didn't have nearly as much reaction as Wednesday _
that was a wild and crazy day.''
   The catalyst for the selloff this week was a report from the
American Petroleum Institute, released after the market closed
Tuesday, that U.S. crude oil inventories rose by an unexpectedly
large 8.1 million barrels last week, bringing stocks significantly
higher than a year earlier.
   Lingering worries about oversupply by OPEC members also
depressed prices.
   Responding to the price weakness, OPEC's acting president Sadek
Boussena on Thursday said the cartel ministers were weighing
various steps, including an emergency meeting, to try to halt the
slide in world oil prices.
   Market rumors that OPEC was considering such a meeting to deal
with the price declines, which have trimmed $3 a barrel in recent
weeks, had helped arrest a plunge in prices Wednesday.

   The dollar finished narrowly mixed Thursday in
quiet trading ahead of the Easter holiday weekend.
   Gold prices rose worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $375.90 a troy
ounce, up $1.60 from late Wednesday. Republic National Bank in New
York quoted a late bid for gold at $375.25 an ounce, up 50 cents.
   Activity finished early in Europe, where traders have a four-day
weekend. In domestic dealings, traders spent a dull session
squaring accounts ahead of what will be a short trading session on
Friday.
   ``There's not much interest out there at all,'' said Stephen
Flanagan, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   The most notable activity came from Japanese investors, who sold
dollars for yen. Flanagan said there was some speculation among
traders that the Bank of Japan might move to raise interest rates
over the weekend in an attempt to bolster the weak Japanese
currency.
   Still, the dollar maintained its strength against the yen,
relinquishing ground only in Asian trading.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.50 yen to a closing 158.00 yen. Later in London,
it was quoted at 158.14 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at
158.18 yen, up from 157.95 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6425 from $1.6432 late
Wednesday. In New York, sterling fell to $1.6420 from Wednesday's
$1.6425.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6724 West German marks, up from
1.6720; 1.4818 Swiss francs, up from 1.4800; 5.6160 French francs,
up from 5.6110; 1,229.50 Italian lire, down from 1,230.25, and
1.1617 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1645.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6730 West German marks, down from
1.6737; 1.4835 Swiss francs, down from 1.4837; 5.6213 French
francs, down from 5.6270; 1.8840 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8852;
1.231.50 Italian lire, down from 1,232.50; and 1.1633 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1650.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $375.25 a troy ounce from
$374.75 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid
of $375.50 from $374. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.07 to
close at a bid of $376.20.
   Silver prices were little changed. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery slipped to $5.091 a troy ounce, from
Wednesday's $5.129. In London, gold traded at a late bid of $5.11
an ounce, unchanged from Wednesday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended April 2, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,269 billion from $3,273 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,062.3 billion from $4,069.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $808.3 billion from $804.9 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 6.4 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 2.9 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,251.5 billion, a 6.2
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,058.9 billion, up 3.0 percent, while M1
rose 4.9 percent to an average of $800.5 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $872 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $116 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$244 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $880
million in the two weeks ended April 4, up from $572 million in the
previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $302 billion in the two-week period ended April
4, down from $304.2 billion two weeks earlier.

   Prices rose on London's Stock Exchange Thursday
despite a lackluster session before the four-day Easter holiday
weekend.
   The market will be closed for Good Friday and Easter Monday.
   A flurry of buying in selected blue chip stocks just before
trading ended Friday helped prices higher.
   The market shrugged off unfavorable economic data released
during the morning.
   Britain's annual inflation rate, as expected, jumped to 8.1
percent in March from 7.5 percent in February, largely because of
increases in mortgage rates, the government said.
   The unemployment rate, meanwhile, held steady at 5.6 percent in
March, it said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 6.6
points, or 0.3 percent, higher, at 2,222.1, just below its session
high of 2,222.2. The index's session low was 2,209.5.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed up 7.7 points at
1,741.0. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 3.47 points to
close at 1,198.79.
   Volume amounted to a light 324.5 million shares, compared with

   Crude oil futures resumed their downward spiral Thursday, giving
back most of Wednesday's gains in a day of roller-coaster trading
that revolved around the prospects for an emergency OPEC meeting.
   Most futures prices of refined oil products also fell in trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   On other commodity markets, live cattle futures posted new
record highs; pork futures advanced; grains and soybeans were
mixed; and precious metals were mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 28 cents
lower with the contract for delivery in May at $17.78 a barrel.
   Wholesale home heating oil was 1.06 cents lower to .20 cent
higher with May at 53.83 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .35
cent to 1.03 cents lower with May at 58.55 cents a gallon.
   Crude oil for May delivery opened above Wednesday's settlement
price, quickly turned sharply lower, then bounced within a 93-cent
range amid reports that OPEC oil ministers were weighing various
steps, including an emergency meeting, to halt the slide in world
oil prices.
   Overproduction of crude by some members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries has been blamed by some analysts for
a $3-a-barrel plunge in oil prices over the past six weeks.
   Springtime is a period of seasonal weakness in the oil market as
demand for heating oil tapers off.
   OPEC's 13 oil ministers have a full meeting scheduled for May 25
to set their output and prices for the second half of the year. But
some traders speculated the cartel would meet sooner than that to
discuss ways of propping up prices.
   ``I think a lot of people were very confused today,'' said Tom
Bentz, director of trading for United Energy Inc.
   ``There were a lot of people below the market with buy orders
and a lot above the market with sell orders,'' he said.
   Bentz said the final selloff, late in the session, may have
reflected profit-taking ahead of the three-day Easter holiday
weekend that begins Friday.
   Live cattle futures made record highs for the second straight
day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid perceptions of tight
near-term supplies and reports of spot cattle prices as high as 82
cents a pound in the Texas panhandle.
   Analysts said the record prices reflect a seasonal peak in
demand for beef and supply tightness stemming from delayed cattle
marketings as a result of dry pasture conditions in the Southern
Plains last fall and winter.
   Futures prices are lower than spot prices, prompting some
packers to turn to the futures market for deliveries, which is also
boosting prices, said Philip Stanley, a trader and consultant for
DEC Futures Inc. in Lincoln, Neb.
   ``On any sign of weakness in the cash market you'll probably see
some pretty active selling come into the futures even with the
discounts on the board,'' tanley said.
   Live cattle futures settled .27 cent lower to .05 cent higher
with the April contract, which traded up to a record 80.47 cents,
ending at 80.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent lower to
.22 cent higher with April at 84 cents a pound; live hogs were .15
cent to .50 cent higher with April at 56.17 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .25 cent lower to 1.25 cents higher with May at
59.02 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures fell moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting increasing harvest pressure from Brazil, while grain
futures ended mixed in subdued, pre-holiday trading.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 2\ cents higher with May
at $3.67 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 2 cents lower with May at
$2.69{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{ cents lower with May at
$1.49} a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents lower with May at
$5.86} a bushel.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $1.30 to $1.60
higher with April at $375.90 a troy ounce; silver was 4 cents lower
across the board with May at $5.108 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall in Lackluster Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices slipped Thursday in light,
pre-holiday trading, with little economic news to affect the
direction of the market, traders said.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 7-32 point, or about
$2.19 for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when
the price declines, rose to 8.59 percent from 8.57 percent late
Wednesday.
   Traders said a retail sales report released by the government
Thursday morning initially boosted Treasury prices because the
March sales figure was weaker than expected. An indication of
economic sluggishness boosts bonds because it implies the Federal
Reserve may act to ease interest rates.
   But news that the government revised the February retail sales
figure upward, from an 0.8 percent decline to an 0.3 percent
decline, caused bond prices to give up their gains.
   Tom Lanier, a Treasury bond trader for Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co., said there was little activity in the market.
   ``There's no buying going on and we keep getting hit by
supply,'' he said, referring to the Treasury's scheduled
announcements next week on upcoming bill and note auctions and an
announcement Thursday from Resolution Trust Corp., the government's
thrift bailout agency, on its bond auction plans.
   The RTC said it may sell up to $42.7 billion in bonds this
quarter, about $20 billion more than Wall Street thought it would
try to sell, Lanier said.
   News of an increased supply of bonds can send prices lower for
fear of a temporary oversupply, but Lanier said the effect on
prices Thursday was minimal.
   Traders said there was little economic news to affect the market
all week. The important wholesale price index for March will be
released Friday, when the market will be closed for the Good Friday
holiday.
   Traders said the market virtually shut down about 2 p.m. EDT in
advance of the day off.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues fell from 1-16 point to 3-32 point, intermediate
maturities dropped from 5-32 to 7-32 point, and long-term issues
fell 7-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.13 to 1,150.01.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 91 7-16. The average yield
to maturity rose to 7.72 percent from 7.51 percent last Wednesday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills remained at 8 percent as
the discount held at 7.75 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose
to 8.19 percent as the discount rose 2 basis points to 7.77
percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.26 percent as the
discount rose 1 basis point to 7.68 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8&lsqb; percent, unchanged from
late Wednesday.

   Stocks reversed their opening gains and traded
lower Thursday morning on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average fell 197.73 points, or 0.67
percent, ending the morning session at 29,242.55. The index, which
shed 184.40 points Wednesday, had opened more than 230 points
higher before falling.
   The dollar edged upward but remained slightly below Wednesday's
levels. The U.S. currency closed the morning session at 158.37 yen,
up from 158.17 yen at the opening but down from 158.50 at
Wednesday's finish.
   The dollar closed at 157.95 yen in New York overnight, up from
157.60 yen late Tuesday.
   Estimated volume on the first section of the stock exchange was
a light 230 million shares.
   ``Trading was inactive, and investors sold small amounts of
stock intermittently,'' said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a trader with Daiwa
Securities Co. He attributed the index's loss mainly to a lack of
confidence stemming from repeated losses in recent weeks.
   ``Stock investors are also nervous about the yen's weakness
against the West German mark, instead of the dollar, and this is
adding to the market's pessimism,'' Suzuki added.
   The dollar inched up from its opening level as market players
sold the yen against the West German mark, dealers said.
   ``As market players are having difficulties figuring out the
direction of dollar-yen trading, their interest has shifted from
the dollar to the mark,'' said Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with
Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   Other dealers said market players generally avoided major moves
ahead of the Easter holidays in many European nations beginning
Friday.
   Prices of government bonds eased, pushing up interest rates
slightly. The yield on the benchmark No. 119 government bond rose
to 7.305 percent from 7.295 percent the previous day.

<HEAD>Debt Holders Told Company Won't Be Profitable Until End of 1993</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southland Corp. said it will continue to lose
money until 1993 even if debt holders agree to forego $1.6 billion
in interest payments as part of a complex debt restructuring.
   The owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain projected a
small $38 million profit in 1993 if it can restructure its debts
and use cash to revamp its stores.
   The forecast was contained in a preliminary prospectus on the
restructuring that the company issued Wednesday.
   The plan involves the restructuring of $1.8 billion in bonds and
preferred stock, and would require holders of those securities to
forego $1.6 billion in interest payments due through 1997. It also
calls for selling 75 percent of the company to Japanese business
partners.
   The company is struggling because it took on about $4.9 billion
in debt when the founding Thompson family took Southland private in
1987. The company lost $1.3 billion last year.
   The prospectus said Southland expects to lose $156 million this
year, $61 million in 1991 and $9 million in 1992. Capital
investments in new stores should bring the company a $38 million
profit in 1993 and a $67 million gain in 1994.
   Southland late last month announced plans to sell 75 percent of
the company to its Japanese partners, Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd. and
7-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd., in exchange for $400 million in badly
needed cash.
   Bond holders are skeptical about the proposal, which would give
them a stake of about 10 percent, the Thompson family about 10
percent and other common shareholders about 5 percent of the
restructured company.
   Southland officials reiterated their belief that unless
bondholders approve the restructuring, cash-flow problems would
force the company to seek relief under the bankruptcy code.
   The preliminary filing stated that Southland plans to open 1,814
new stores and close 1,724 others by the end of 1997 to compete
with convenience store rivals. Southland opened 60 stores and
closed 340 others in 1989.

<HEAD>Some Suppliers Reportedly Shutting Off Ames</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some suppliers reportedly are refusing
to ship goods to Ames Department Stores, putting further pressure
on the loss-plagued discount chain which is seeking a new credit
agreement from banks.
   Shipments of clothing, hardware, soft drinks and other products
needed to fill Ames' shelves for spring have been suspended for the
last month by some suppliers who say they haven't been paid for
earlier deliveries, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
   The report comes as Ames tries to dig itself out of a cash
crunch by selling stores and cutting jobs.
   Ames announced Monday that it lost an estimated $288 million in
the fiscal year ending Jan. 27 because of lower than anticipated
sales at the former Zayre stores Ames bought in 1988. It also
announced it was negotiating with banks for a credit agreement.
   The $788 million acquisition of the 392-store Zayre chain
doubled Ames' size and transformed the company from a little-known
New England-based chain into the nation's fourth-largest discounter.
   As part of the credit agreement it is seeking, Ames plans to
close 74 unprofitable stores. The company is negotiating to sell
the inventory of those stores to Jerome Schottentein, a Columbus,
Ohio, merchandise liquidator.
   The retailer also said Monday it will slash 200 jobs at its
corporate headquarters in Rocky Hill.
   Ames officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment on
the Journal report.
   The newspaper reported that Gerber Childrenswear Inc., a unit of
Gerber Products Co., said it will not ship $1 million worth of
spring wear ordered by Ames until it is paid a portion of the $1.2
million owed by Ames for winter clothing shipped earlier.
   The Journal also reported that Pepsico Inc. said it will not
make soft drink deliveries to Ames unless it is paid in cash.
   Retail analysts said the suppliers' actions could touch off a
downward spiral for Ames if the company is unable to convince key
vendors that it can turn itself around.
   ``Unfortunately, when these situations occur, they tend to have
a snowball effect,'' said Alan Millstein, publisher of The Fashion
Network, a monthly newsletter for retailers and manufacturers.
``This becomes and has a tendency to spread like wildfire,'' he
said.
   Jeffrey Branman, managing director for Financo Inc., a New York
investment bank that specializes in retail industry transactions,
said the slowdown in deliveries from suppliers is particularly
critical coming at the start of the spring season, when shoppers
expect new clothing lines to come in.
   ``What can happen is that because vendors tend to act en masse,
it can turn a modest cash shortage into a big cash shortage,'' said
Branman.
   Analysts cited a similar problem experienced by two Campeau
Corp. subsidiaries, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp.
   Earlier this year, a shutdown by suppliers helped force the
subsidiaries into filing for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Some analysts said they believe the company can bounce back from
its current problems by moving quickly to convince suppliers they
will be paid.
   ``Most of the people who are selling to them don't want to see
Ames go away. ... If they can get their key vendors paid and in
line, I think they'll be OK,'' said Joseph Ahearn, a retail
industry analyst for GDL Management Inc., a New York-based crisis
management consulting firm.
   Millstein said the most important thing for Ames to do now is to
``put a very positive spin'' on their operations with Ames.
   ``It becomes an issue of how quickly they can convince their
suppliers that they are not a credit risk,'' he said.

   The stock market broke the stalemate of the past
several sessions with a rally in quiet pre-holiday trading Thursday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 22.07 to
2,751.80, finishing the week with a net gain of 34.68 points.
   That snapped a streak of six consecutive trading days in which
the Dow industrials neither rose nor fell by as much as 10 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
908 up, 573 down and 518 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came 142.47 million shares,
against 141.08 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 173.70 million shares.
   Analysts said traders came into the session with low
expectations, given the market's recent sluggish behavior and the
approach of a long holiday weekend. The markets will be closed for
Good Friday.
   In that kind of environment, observers said, an absence of
selling pressure helped produce some pleasant surprises in the
price fluctuations of individual stocks.
   The government reported that retail sales dropped 0.6 percent in
March, in contrast to advance estimates of a small increase.
   That served as a new suggestion of continued sluggish, erratic
economic growth, along with possibly less upward pressure on
interest rates than has been feared of late.
   Brokers also noted that favorable earnings reports from several
companies contributed to the upbeat mood.
   For example, Chemical Banking, which posted higher quarterly
profits, gained 1&lsqb; to 24{. Most other money-center bank issues
moved up in sympathy.
   Federal National Mortgage jumped 1} to 36}. On Wednesday the
company, known as Fannie Mae, chalked up a 67 percent increase in
its first-quarter profits.
   Fannie Mae warrants, which give their owners the right to buy
the stock at $14.75 a share, rose 1{ to 21~.
   Gainers among the blue-chip industrials included General
Electric, up 1&lsqb; at 66; International Business Machines, up } at
107&lsqb;; McDonald's, up { at 32|; Procter &amp; Gamble, up { at 71\, and
Coca-Cola, up { at 80{.
   Ames Department Stores led the active list, down | at 1~ on
reports that some manufacturers had stopped shipping merchandise to
the troubled retailer.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $21.15 billion, or
0.64 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.23 to 188.80.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.84 to 399.96, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.42 at 344.34.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 2.78 to 436.31. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 357.88, up .34.

   Share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
Friday morning and the dollar moved slightly higher against the yen.
   Trading was very quiet in Japan's financial markets ahead of the
weekend, especially because many markets in Europe and the United
States will be closed later in the day because of Good Friday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 302.96
points, or 1 percent, closing the morning session at 29,320.24. The
index gained 182.92 points Thursday.
   The dollar was changing hands at 158.33 yen, up 0.33 yen from
Thursday's close. After opening at 158.27 yen, the currency ranged
between 158.22 yen and 158.40 yen.
   Shinji Tanaka, a currency dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank,
said trading was ``very quiet'' with most players retreating to the
sidelines.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index initially fell on
index-linked arbitrage selling and then on small-lot selling,
securities dealers said.
   In arbitrage trading, investors seek to profit from differences
between prices of actual stocks and stock index futures.
   Yoshihide Koyama, an equity analyst with Nikko Securites,
attributed the fall in the index to speculation that Japan's
central bank may raise its official discount rate once again in an
attempt to stem the yen's downswing.
   The Bank of Japan raised its key rate last month by 1 percentage
point to 5.25 percent. Higher interest rates tend to support a
country's currency, but discourage stock investment.
   Government bond prices fell during the morning, boosting
interest rates. The yield on the benchmark No. 119 government bond
rose to 7.37 percent from 7.295 percent Thursday.
