   David Lloyd Kreeger, former chairman of Geico
Insurance Co. and longtime patron of the arts in the Washington
area, is dead at age 81.
   Kreeger died of cancer at his home Sunday.
   A New York native who attended Rutgers University and Harvard
Law School, Kreeger was a private attorney, with Geico as a client,
when he formed a group to buy shares in the insurer in 1948.
   In 1957, Kreeger gave up his law practice to become a Geico vice
president. He was chairman and chief executive from 1970 until his
retirement in 1974.
   Kreeger served as president of the National Symphony Orchestra
from 1970 to 1978 and gave his name to three buildings financed
with the help of his donations at area cultural institutions - the
Kreeger Theater at Arena Stage, the Kreeger Music Building at
American University and the Kreeger Auditorium at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art. He served as president and chairman of the Corcoran
for 20 years.
   His art collection contained works of the most famous artists of
the 19th and 20th centuries, including Degas, Renoir, van Gogh,
Picasso and Kadinsky, but he cared most about music.
   Kreeger played violin in musical evenings at home with
professionals and was most proud of a remark from famed cellist
Pablo Casals that he, Kreeger, should practice more often - it
showed that his playing was good enough so that practice could
improve it.

   The chairman of Minnesota's second largest
bank was taken captive by a nattily dressed armed man as he drove
into the bank parking lot Monday, but escaped unharmed about two
hours later, the FBI said.
   A man wearing a topcoat, a business suit and a brown tweed hat
jumped into banker John Grundhofer's Mercedes Benz as he arrived
for work at First Bank System Inc. shortly after 8 a.m., said FBI
spokesman Jeff Jamar.
   The kidnapper, armed with a handgun and knife, then ordered him
to drive out of the city, Jamar said.
   Authorities provided only sketchy details about the kidnapping
and did not reveal a motive.
   They said Grundhofer escaped after about two hours when he was
left unattended in a wooded area in western Wisconsin. He later
called for help from a nearby farmhouse.
   The kidnapper made a ransom demand, which Grundhofer relayed to
the bank from his car phone, but the banker escaped before steps
were made to pay it, said Minneapolis Police Chief John Laux.
   The size of the ransom request was not disclosed. Grundhofer's
car was not immediately recovered.
   ``I'm OK,'' Grundhofer told a news conference later. ``I have no
idea why this took place this morning. I'm very grateful to the
good Lord for me being here.''
   Grundhofer, 51, was vice chairman and senior executive officer
for southern California at San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank
before hired as chairman at First Bank in January.
   The abductor, described as 50 to 60 years old and more than 6
feet tall, did not appear to be a professional criminal, Jamar
said.
   First Bank, which has total assets of $19.2 billion, is the
second largest bank holding company in Minnesota and the 36th
largest in the nation.

   George Esper, who covered the Vietnam War for
The Associated Press from 1965 until its end in 1975, interviewed
former Red Cross worker Cherie Rankin before her return to Vietnam.
Here are her reflections of her journey into the past.

   Like a growing number of Americans who
served in Vietnam, Cherie Rankin returned there after 20 years to
help rebuild a small part of what the war destroyed.
   In doing so, she also restored a part of her life.
   ``I think what it means is there's been enough distance from the
trauma to make it safe for people to deal with it,'' she said. ``It
means relations between our two countries are going to improve.''
   For six weeks, Ms. Rankin, a former Red Cross worker, labored in
the punishing sun mixing mortar to help build a medical clinic near
Hanoi destroyed by U.S. bombers.
   At the end of October, she came home to the United States for
the second time, a ``twice-in-a-lifetime experience.'' She cried
for the living she left behind this trip. The last time, in 1971,
it was for the dead.
   Two decades ago, she brought back with her the images of war,
orphans scorched by napalm and blinded by bombs. This time, she
came back with images of carefree, curious, clinging children who
followed her wherever she went.
   Returning home, she clutched a hat full of love: the conical hat
her Vietnamese co-workers signed as a remembrance on the day the
clinic was finished and they parted with warm embraces and tears.
   ``There was a lot of crying that day,'' she recalled.
   In a sense, her return was part of a broader pilgrimage by
Americans in recent years. Their return is a sentimental journey, a
reconnecting with their past, when they were young men and women
undergoing a transcendent experience.
   Ms. Rankin was only 24 then. For more than 10 years after she
came home the first time in September 1971 after a year's tour,
thinking about Vietnam made her sick to her stomach. She threw up
at a reunion of Red Cross workers in 1984.
   Today, at age 44, she said Vietnam revisited has probably
exorcised the demons from her mind that even counseling couldn't
capture. Ms. Rankin herself is a psychotherapist.
   ``I think it has probably put a closure on it in a way that it
hadn't before,'' she said. ``I probably will never use the word
`resolve.' It's not something I want to have resolved. I don't ever
want to forget the pain of the war because I might become
complacent about war.''
   Her return helped change the images in her mind of napalmed
babies, starving children and the poverty and sadness she read in
the faces of the Vietnamese when she was there two decades before.
   ``What I see now is ... happy children, sparkle and twinkles in
the eyes of the people going on with their lives,'' Ms. Rankin
said. ``There's still incredible poverty, but it's not so dirty.
They're not starving because they grow their own food and are able
to do that now.
   ``They still don't have things, still live in small homes and
they don't have access to good medical care. But it's not the same
kind of thing that happened during the war when they were displaced
from their ancestral roots and their agricultural attachment to the
land.''
   Ms. Rankin was part of a group of seven American civilians and
military veterans who paid their own way to Vietnam to build badly
needed medical facilities. They were the third team of Americans to
return under the auspices of the Veterans Vietnam Restoration
Project in Garberville, Calif.
   Only non-governmental American organizations can give Vietnam
humanitarian aid since the two governments have no diplomatic
relations and the United States has imposed a trade embargo on the
country.
   Ms. Rankin said most of the Vietnamese expressed interest in
restoring relations so there could be free trade, communications
and travel.
   ``They really are puzzled by our continued boycott of them and
they were constantly in wonder of us,'' she said. ``It was
impossible to walk down the street without being surrounded by
adults as well as children.
   ``I think that I - and it's probably true for the other veterans
that went with me - represented something bigger to the Vietnamese.
The people we met saw us as representatives of our government. So
there was a sense ... that things were softening. ... Fifteen years
is long enough to hold a grudge.''
   Kevin Bowen, a veteran and co-director of The William Joiner
Center for the Study of War and Social Consequences at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston, said Americans returning to
Vietnam are finding it a way of healing some of the mental wounds
of the war.
   ``I think for veterans in this country, it's important to get
this episode behind us,'' said Bowen, who has made five trips back
to Vietnam. ``We need to have different relations with Vietnam and
with our past and not an angry, vindictive relationship. We're not
just punishing Vietnam. We're punishing ourselves.''
   Ms. Rankin returned to Vietnam with the intention of mourning
the men whose hands she held as they lay dying and the Vietnamese
orphans she embraced - the blind, the legless, the retarded.
   She had detached herself from her feelings during the war in
order to do the job of building morale among the GIs.
   This time, work got in her way.
   ``I didn't really have a lot of time,'' she said. ``The work was
very exhausting. We also had a lot of demands on our after-hours
time, going to meet their governing bodies, to functions and to
cultural events.''
   But she cried when she said goodbye to her Vietnamese friends at
the clinic and when she visited the grounds of the Sacred Heart
Orphanage in Da Nang, where she had tended the children in her free
time.
   The orphanage was almost exactly as she remembered it. But the
children had been moved to another home south of Da Nang. In one of
the many ironies of Vietnam, Sacred Heart now is home for old
people who have nobody, their children killed in the war.
   After the clinic was built, Ms. Rankin spent two more weeks in
Vietnam. She retraced her wartime steps in what was then South
Vietnam, basking in the moments that almost seemed unreal - and
remembering.
   The sites stepped out of history to meet her: Marble Mountain,
Monkey Mountain, China Beach.
   She recognized them all.

<HEAD>Police Say Crime Increasing in Europe</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law enforcement officials say
violent crime is on the rise in some of Europe's traditionally
law-abiding nations. Critics accuse them of stirring up fear to get
bigger budgets.
   The average homicide rate in Europe remains only about one-fifth
that of the United States, which has approximately nine homicides
per 100,000 people each year, according to the U.N. World Health
Organization in Geneva.
   Homicide rates for the Netherlands and Switzerland rose 20
percent and 13 percent respectively in 1989, according to police
figures.
   Norway reported a 29 percent rise in violent crime from 1986
through 1988 and Italian homicides increased by 35 percent last
year, mostly in Mafia regions.
   Rape and theft skyrocketed last year in Eastern Europe,
accompaniments to economic instability and a deep-seated mistrust
of police under the former communist regimes.
   In Denmark, France and Portugal, however, the low homicide rates
have hardly changed in recent years. Significant declines have been
recorded in Britain, Germany and Belgium.
   ``Our whole society is getting more aggressive,'' said
Commissioner Herman Bergsma of the Central Police Intelligence
Service in Holland. ``What used to end up in fistfights now ends up
in gunfights.''
   The number of assaults with firearms in the Netherlands nearly
doubled from 134 in 1985 to 245 last year, mainly because of
killings by drug traffickers, Bergsma said.
   According to WHO statistics, the homicide rate in this nation of
14.9 million people had been one of the world's lowest, just above
Britain and Ireland.
   Herman Franke, a criminologist at the University of Amsterdam,
believes police are classifying more crime as violent to support
requests for larger budgets and more officers.
   ``Crime statistics are highly political,'' he said. ``They're
used to influence public opinion in every country.''
   In the Norwegian parliamentary elections, the conservative Party
of Progress went from 2 of the 165 seats to 22 on a wave of public
anxiety that followed reports of the 29 percent growth in violent
crime.
   ``Violent crime is not increasing,'' Franke said, ``only our
sensitivity to it.''
   Nils Christie, a University of Oslo criminology professor, said:
``Our biggest crime problem is the unfounded anxiety people feel.''
   Although the murder rate in neighboring Sweden has barely
changed in years, tighter gun laws are to take effect in 1991.
   Total crimes reported in Poland rose from 137,000 in 1988 to
more than 500,00 last year.
   ``The crime we witness today is a result of the political
situation,'' said Janusz Wydra, deputy police chief of Warsaw.
``The more freedom there is, the less security.''
   Poland has embarked on a conversion from communism to capitalism
that has cost about 1 million people their jobs and driven most
prices up more than 180 percent.
   Franke, the Dutch criminologist, argued that skyrocketing
statistics in former communist countries indicate the old regimes
doctored figures for political reasons, not that crime has
increased dramatically.
   He conceded that homes and businesses in the new East European
democracies are easy targets for thieves, since their owners have
little experience with crime prevention.
   ``In Warsaw, the situation is terrifying,'' said Wincenty
Grzeszczyk of the Polish General Prosecutor's Department. Stores do
a booming business in window grates, auto alarms, deadbolt locks
and Mace.
   Statistics in Czechoslovakia indicate crime has increased 400
percent in some Prague districts since President Vaclav Havel
declared a general amnesty in 1989 for most prisoners jailed under
the communists. The amnesty brought the release of about two-thirds
of the prison population.
   Muggings rose 250 percent in urban areas during the first six
months of 1990 and total crime was up 138 percent in the same
period, according to official figures.
   Italy is the most crime-prone country in Western Europe. Last
year's 1,295 homicides reflected a 35 percent increase from 1988.
   Britain tightened gun laws after a gun collector in Hungerford,
60 miles west of London, killed 16 people, including his mother, in
August 1987, then took his own life. The homicide rate has fallen
by half under the new laws.
   Most European countries severely restrict gun ownership, but
firearms are relatively easy to buy on the black market.
   Police in Copenhagen found hundreds of hand grenades, mines,
anti-tank rockets, handguns and rifles in the possession of a
pro-Palestinian group that had robbed banks for seven years.
   Still, Franke credited tough gun-control laws with making
European cities relatively murder-free - because, he said, ``people
can't resort to guns to solve their quarrels.''

<HEAD>U.N. Report: AIDS Explosion Likely In Asia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though less then 1 percent of all known
AIDS cases are in Asia and the Pacific, the region can expect a
dramatic increase over the next few years, a new U.N. report says.
   The study, released Monday, quoted an Asian medical journal as
saying: ``All the factors that have allowed AIDS to assume epidemic
proportions in Africa - poor genital health of women, malnutrition,
hepatitis, intestinal worms, low immunity levels - are just as
endemic in Asia.''
   The report was presented to a meeting in Bangkok of the
population and social development committee of the U.N. Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. The five-day
meeting began Monday.
   As of February, there had been a total of 215,144 AIDS cases
reported in 153 countries, but just 2,067 of them were in Asian and
Pacific countries, the report says.
   But the Asia-Pacific figure may be low because nearly
three-fourths of the reported cases are in Australia, which has one
of the region's best reporting systems, the report notes.
   ``Many countries reported no cases at all, and in some instances
this was in conflict with other evidence,'' it says.
   ``There can be little doubt that the number of cases in the
Asian and Pacific region will grow dramatically over the next few
years.''
   The World Health Organization estimates there are now 500,000
HIV-infected people in Asia, the report says.
   HIV, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, causes AIDS, or Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome. But people who become infected with HIV
do not always get AIDS, which fatally destroys the body's immune
system.
   AIDS is most commonly transmitted through sexual intercourse,
infected hypodermic needles and blood transfusions.
   ``HIV infection in the (Asia-Pacific) region began later than in
other parts of the world, but the current growth in HIV infection
in the region ensures that the number of AIDS cases will grow
rapidly in the future,'' the U.N. report says.
   ``It is projected that 75 percent of those with HIV infection
will develop AIDS within 15 years and 95 percent within 20 years.''
   The report recommends stronger education and information
campaigns to combat the spread of the disease.

   Japanese companies have set their sights on doing
business with Vietnam, which many avoided for years in order not to
upset the United States.
   ``It's Vietnam fever,'' said Tatsuo Torigoe, an Asia division
manager of Kanematsu Corp., Japan's major trading house. ``The time
has finally come for us to make a move.''
   Analysts in Tokyo believe Japanese televisions, refrigerators
and other household goods will soon fill shops in Vietnam as they
do in other nations around the globe.
   They also expect Japanese businessmen to buy more Vietnamese
petroleum. Oil already accounts for more than half Japan's imports
from the Southeast Asian nation, which is impoverished but rich in
resources.
   Five times as many Japanese companies sent representatives to
Vietnam in 1988 as in 1987 ``and it is my impression that there
will be more this year,'' said Akitake Yamamoto, a spokesman for a
Kanematsu subsidiary that has traded there for more than 20 years.
   Until recent months, Japanese companies were either restricting
business with Vietnam or dealing discreetly.
   Activity was dampened by their government's support of the U.S.
policy of isolating Vietnam and by a 1987 U.S. Senate resolution
urging Japan to prevent private companies from trading with
Vietnam.
   Although Washington still refuses to establish formal diplomatic
relations with Vietnam, there are indications it may be taking a
less hostile attitude. This has helped reawaken Japanese interest.
   The most visible example of a thaw was the agreement reached by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Foreign Minister Nguyen
Co Thach of Vietnam in September to cooperate in searching for
American soldiers missing in action and in resolving Cambodia's
civil war, in which Vietnamese troops have been heavily involved.
   With that and recent Vietnamse efforts to entice foreign
investment, Japanese companies are shedding reservations about
doing business there.
   Kanematsu has applied to the Vietnamese government for a license
to open offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.
   The Bank of Tokyo, which had a branch in Saigon in 1962-1975,
began to consider reopening it ``when we realized the improving
Cambodian situation and Vietnamese economy over the last couple of
years,'' said spokesman Kazuhiro Miya.
   Victor Co. of Japan, which already exports television sets to
Vietnam, and Sanyo Electric Trade Co., a purveyor of home
appliances, both plan to open offices in Ho Chi Minh City.
   ``Our business in Vietnam is determined by the Japanese
government's policy, which is based on the U.S.-Vietnamese
relations,'' Miya said. ``When the U.S.-Vietnamese relationship
improves more, we'll be a few steps ahead of the Americans.''
   Trade already is increasing dramatically. Japanese exports to
Vietnam reached $270 million in the first half of 1990, up 84
percent from the same period in 1989, and imports from Vietnam
increased two-thirds to $124 million.
   Vietnam's population of about 67 million also may provide
Japanese companies with a source of cheap labor.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said the government
was not particularly concerned about the renewed business interest
in Vietnam. Asked about U.S. reaction, he replied: ``I think we've
been exchanging views.''
   A U.S. diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
noted that the United States has yet to lift restrictions on
Americans doing business with Vietnam.
   ``What other governments do with their business people is their
business,'' he said. ``I think the government of Japan is aware of
our view that relations should not be entirely normalized, that we
cannot conduct business as usual'' until the Cambodian conflict is
resolved.
   It is not yet business as usual between Tokyo and Hanoi, but
relations clearly are improving.
   In October, Thach became the first Vietnamese foreign minister
in 12 years to pay an official visit to Japan.
   Japan promised him a $180,000 grant for Vietnam's national
television station, the first major economic assistance since 1978,
the Foreign Ministry said.
   Japanese corporations believe they can help Vietnam's backward
economy enter the modern world.
   Torigoe, the Kanematsu official, said his firm plans to renovate
Vietnamese factories and equipment to help make the country's
products competitive.
   ``We are not doing this for charity,'' he said. ``We don't mind
extra investments, considering Vietnam's potential and its location
close by. Vietnam is that attractive.''

<HEAD>Syria Believed to Match Iraq in Chemical Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syria, a newfound U.S. ally against Saddam
Hussein, has a chemical weapons arsenal at least as dangerous as
Iraq's, U.S. experts say.
   The two nations are believed to be the biggest producers of
chemical weapons in the Mideast, creating hundreds of tons of the
deadly gas each year. World attention has focused on Iraq's
chemical capability in the three months since its unprovoked
invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
   Washington's relations with Damascus, strained for many years
over Syria's support for international terrorism and its hardline
positions against Israel, have warmed in recent weeks since the
Syrians joined the anti-Iraq coalition.
   Syria has promised to send 15,000 troops to join the U.S.-led
multinational force arrayed against Iraq in Saudi Arabia.
   U.S. officials say they are concerned about the Syrian chemical
weapons production and have tried to prevent Syria from obtaining
the materials necessary to produce such arms.
   The United States is part of the Australia Group, named for the
country that initiated the international effort to stop the
proliferation of cheical weapons - the poor man's atom bomb.
   The 16-nation group tracks companies that sell components for
the production of nerve and mustard gas, and encourages governments
to tighten their export control laws for such chemicals and to
prosecute violators.
   At least five Arab countries manufacture chemical weapons:
Syria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq and Libya. Israel also is known to have a
sizable chemical weapons cache.
   Syria's chemical warfare program has been a cause of concern to
its biggest arms supplier, the Soviet Union. In 1988, the head of
the Soviet chemical warfare corps, Vladimir Pikalov, visited Syria
to find out what it was up to, said Seth Carus, a modern warfare
expert.
   ``The Soviets believed the Syrians were lying to them about not
producing'' chemical weapons, said Carus.
   But attempts to stop Syria have largely failed.
   Syria, like Iraq, got most of its help in setting up production
facilities through German companies, although other Western
European firms also were involved, experts say.
   Damascus received its first chemical weapons from Egypt in 1972
in the form of chemical-filled artillery shells, but did not use
such weapons in its 1973 war with Israel.
   It acquired production capability in the mid-1980s,
concentrating on the agent Sarin, which paralyzes the human nervous
system, said Carus. Syria is believed to have two production
facilities - one just north of Damascus and the other near the city
of Homs. The program is run by CERS, a governmental scientific
research authority.
   Syria produces several hundred tons of nerve and mustard gas
every year, said Carus. Iraq is believed to produce an estimated
800 tons of nerve and mustard agents every year.
   But Syria is believed to have more accurate means of delivering
the chemicals than Iraq does.
   Israeli experts who track the Syrian program believe Syria has
equipped Soviet-made SS-21 rockets with chemical warheads, said
Leonard Specter, an arms control researcher at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace.
   The short-range SS-21s are highly accurate and could inflict
severe damage on next-door Israel, immobilizing its air force and
reserve call-ups in the initial stages of a war, said Specter.
Syria also is believed to have equipped longer-range SCUD missiles
with chemical delivery capability.
   Iraq may have placed chemical warheads on some of its
Soviet-designed SCUDs, which have been modified to reach targets as
far away as Israel, 600 miles away.
   Syria also could attack Israel with chemical artillery shells,
which are far cheaper and more abundant than missiles, said Edward
Luttwak of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
``They have the advantage of being near enough (to) Israel to use
shells and cause damage,'' he said.
   But most independent experts believe Syria is unlikely to use
chemical weapons unless it felt seriously threatened by Israel's
superior military might.
   Specter said: ``Some weapons are less usable because of who your
adversary is. Syria would have to think long and hard before it
risked retaliation from Israel or Iraq, for that matter.''
   Iraq and Iran are known to have used chemical weapons during
their eight-year war in the 1980s, and Egypt is known to have
mounted 32 attacks with such weapons while putting down an
insurrection in Yemen in the 1960s.
   Iraq also unleashed chemical agents against its Kurdish minority
in 1988, killing and wounding thousands.

   Along the Champs Elysees, sidewalks bustle with
tourists and shoppers. A block away, a posh neighborhood is sealed
off by steel barricades and riot police so world leaders can talk
peace.
   It is one of many contrasts to be found in Paris as the leaders
of 34 countries convene a three-day summit today intended to push
Europe into the post-Cold War era.
   Throughout the area around the ornate Kleber International
Conference Center are flags, tents and festive decorations. Equally
evident are the manifestations of a vast, state-of-the-art security
operation.
   Police have conducted door-to-door inspections of buildings in
the vicinity, interviewing residents and issuing special passes so
they can use their homes. Sewers have been checked for bombs, and
sophisticated X-ray machines have been installed at the entrances
of conference facilities.
   More than 10,000 French police have been mobilized, complemented
by the secret service agents of individual leaders.
   While Secretary of State James A. Baker III held talks Sunday
night at the luxury Intercontinental Hotel, one his agents clad in
a jogging suit spoke into a walkie-talkie in the lobby.
   A horde of cameramen and photographers seeking to cover Baker
were asked to lay their equipment on the floor. In came a hound
that sniffed the cameras for explosives.
   Along with security, there is a strong emphasis on public
relations.
   The French have issued mountains of press releases giving
background on the summit. The Soviets opened a special press center
at their embassy where the thousands of journalists on hand can
pick up glossy brochures about Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Even the Soviet republic of Armenia, not a participant at any
level in the summit, has scheduled a press conference.
   Parisians have been warned to avoid driving in the area around
the conference center and the Arc de Triomphe. The Kleber subway
stop has been closed, several bus routes suspended, and numerous
streets closed off.
   Two taxi drivers wondered bitterly why the summit had to be in
Paris, rather than one of the grand chateaus on the outskirts of
the city.
   Said one: ``The leaders are coming to make peace, but for us,
work will be war.''

<HEAD>Court Ruling on CNN-Noriega Tapes Harms Press Freedom, Advocates
Say</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court is condoning at least brief
``gag orders'' against the news media by refusing to let Cable News
Network broadcast tape-recorded conversations of Panama's Gen.
Manuel Noriega, say free press advocates.
   They said the justices' action Sunday was extraordinary and
poses grave risks to unfettered reporting of court proceedings
nationwide.
   Attorney Floyd Abrams, who is representing CNN, said, ``The
court has left an opening through which defense lawyers and
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles.''
   The high court's 7-2 rejection of CNN's emergency request ``does
seem to countenance brief prior restraints of a few days' duration
based on almost no showing of need at all,'' he said.
   The court's action Sunday effectively bars CNN from broadcasting
tape-recordings of conversations between Noriega and his lawyers.
   CNN had asked the justices to lift U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler's order forbidding the broadcasts until he could determine
what is on the tapes.
   The network said it will now turn over the tapes to Hoeveler's
court in Miami.
   Bruce Sanford, a lawyer who represents the Society of
Professional Journalists, said, ``The Supreme Court decision is a
grave disappointment that departs from existing Supreme Court
precedent. It is particularly troublesome because it seems
inconceivable that Noriega's counsel would ever be able to prove
that his right to a fair trial was in jeopardy because of the CNN
tapes.''
   Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters' Committee for
Freedom of the Press, called the development a stunning departure
that ``signals a new era in First Amendment jurisprudence. It will
have a far-reaching impact in ... courts around the country.''
   However, Noriega defense attorney Jon May said, ``We think it's
a correct ruling. This was a major mistake by CNN, a big, big
mistake. This is a case of the messenger shooting itself. To
whatever extent the media may complain this is a significant
adverse decision, CNN has only itself to blame.''
   Only Justices Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor sided
with CNN.
   Marshall, writing for both, said, ``I do not see how the prior
restraint imposed in this case can be reconciled'' with prior high
court rulings. He said Hoeveler's Nov. 8 order barring the CNN
broadcasts is based on the ``remarkable conclusion that publication
can be automatically restrained'' while courts study the basis for
such restraints.
   The seven justices who rejected CNN's application were silent,
leaving it unclear what they believe about the underlying
controversy.
   In the majority were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.
   The high court order does not preclude the justices from some
day deciding that Hoeveler's order did violate CNN's free speech
rights protected by the First Amendment.
   The court could have refused to help CNN on some narrower
grounds and could review the issue at a later date if there is
still a live controversy.
   The Bush administration had joined with Noriega's lawyers in
opposing the CNN request.
   The Justice Department had said, ``The First Amendment is part
of the rule of law, not above it. A lasting prior restraint on
publication may be justified only in the most extraordinary
circumstances. But the rule of law requires permitting a court to
determine if those circumstances exist.''
   In addition to CNN's emergency request, the court also issued a
one-sentence order turning down a formal appeal filed by the cable
network.
   CNN President Tom Johnson called the court's decision ``a loss
of a battle in a continuing war against censorship.''
   He said he hopes Hoeveler will permit CNN to air the tapes after
reviewing them.
   The federal government lost a much-publicized battle over a
prior restraint in 1971 when the Supreme Court allowed The New York
Times and The Washington Post to publish the so-called Pentagon
papers detailing American involvement in Vietnam.
   But some observers noted that for several days the high court
itself had, in effect, blocked publication while it was reviewing
the dispute.
   The prior restraint then was based on the government's claim
that publication would hurt national security.
   In a key 1976 decision, the court unanimously struck down a gag
order issued against the news media by a judge presiding over a
Nebraska murder case. The court said then that such orders may be
used only as a last resort and that judges first must consider less
drastic measures.
   Noriega, who is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million
in payoffs to protect cocaine trade through Panama, is being held
in a federal prison near MIami. Federal prison authorities monitor
and tape-record all inmates' telephone conversations except those
between inmates and their defense teams.
   But the CNN tape recordings reportedly contain some
conversations between the deposed Panamanian leader and his
lawyers.
   Noriega's lawyers said broadcasting the tapes would create
unfair pretrial publicity, would compromise the confidentiality of
the attorney-client relationship and tip off prosecutors about
defense strategy.

   Judd, 44, has chronic active hepatitis, a liver ailment that can
be fatal.
   She and her daughter, Wynonna, whose hits include ``Mama, He's

   FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) - Bob Keeshan, television's ``Captain
Kangaroo,'' says the aim of many kids' shows today is to sell toys,
not nurture children.
   ``We don't have very much quality in the commercial sector,''
Keeshan, 62, said Sunday. He was a guest at a fund-raiser held by
the Cape Fear Valley Medical Center for children's hospital
services.
   Keeshan cited his own show, ``Mister Rogers'' and ``Sesame
Street'' on public television as programs that nurture children.
Many other children's programs, especially cartoons, jump from the
toy shelf to television, he said.
   ``Captain Kangaroo'' is broadcast on more than 175 public TV
stations nationwide.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Demi Moore says roles for women in Hollywood
aren't what they used to be.
   ``Women in films used to be beautiful and smart and talented and
strong and that was acceptable,'' the actress said in an interview
in Cosmopolitan magazine's December issue. I want to see glamorous,
smart women in movies again and I want to be part of that.''
   The star of this summer's blockbuster ``Ghost'' said most movies
today portray women as rape victims, prostitutes or ``the good
wife.''
   Moore is in four upcoming movies, including ``Mortal Thoughts,''
which also features her husband, ``Die Hard'' star Bruce Willis.

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - Ten years ago, Linda Evans was miserable,
filled with self-doubt and dependent on men. Today, she has a new
life and a new man.
   Evans, best known as Krystle on ``Dynasty,'' will appear next
week in the ABC movie ``I'll Take Romance,'' her first project
since leaving ``Dynasty'' 1{ years ago.
   ``I spent a lot of years really working on myself,'' Evans said
in the Nov. 24 issue of TV Guide. ``I wanted to know where I was
coming from that I would be 37 years of age, have two failed
marriages, no children, and be going out for a career I didn't
want.''
   Evans has found love with 35-year-old New Age music composer
Yanni but said she feels no need to marry him.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Rock musician David Crosby broke several
bones in a weekend motorcyle accident, officials said.
   The 49-year-old Crosby was listed in stable condition Sunday at
Cedars Sinai Medical Center. His left leg, left ankle and left
shoulder were broken in the accident Saturday.
   Crosby is a founding member of the group Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash,
which later became Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young.
   Crosby, who was apparently speeding, skidded about 40 feet down
a curve in suburban Encino, police said.

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - James Garner has taken life a little easier
since he underwent two heart operations in 1988, but he's not out

   ``I'm just not working as hard as I used to,'' the actor said in
the Nov. 24 issue of TV Guide. ``I'm getting more picky.''
   Garner plays a retired judge asked to champion the cause of a
black veteran in the NBC movie ``Decoration Day,'' which airs Dec.

   BOSTON (AP) - U.S. Rep. Barney Frank's quick response when he
suffered a mild heart attack prevented more serious problems, a
doctor says.
   The 50-year-old Massachusetts Democrat took a cab to Beth Israel
Hospital on Saturday night after suffering chest pains while
exercising at a health club.
   Doctors performed an angioplasty to clear a blocked artery to
the heart, and the congressman was resting comfortably Sunday,
officials said.
   ``I'm pleased to say treatment seems to be working,'' said
cardiologist William Grossman. ``He has no other medical
problems.''
   Grossman said the prompt treatment prevented more severe
problems.
   Frank was elected this month to a sixth term. Last summer, the
House reprimanded him for actions stemming from his relationship
with a male prostitute.

   HOUSTON (AP) - If Paul McCartney wants his birth certificate,
he'll have to visit Brian Taylor - and bring his checkbook.
   Taylor, 26, of Washington, D.C., paid $18,000 at an auction
Sunday for the former Beatle's birth certificate, sold to an
American investor by the rock star's stepmother, Angela Williams.
   Taylor said he hoped McCartney would contact him about it, but
Taylor's investment would not be handed over lightly. ``Sure, I'll
sell it to him,'' he said. ``I would have to talk about (the price)
to Mr. McCartney himself.''
   McCartney was born in Liverpool, England, on June 18, 1942.
   ``I'm just a Beatles freak and I had to have it,'' said Taylor.
``It's a hobby that's gone a little too far.''

<HEAD>Kohl Headed for European Security Summit With Elevated Status</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl attends this week's
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe with more prestige
and power than any post-World War II German leader.
   Instead of two German nameplates at the Paris conference - one
each for West Germany and East Germany - there will be just one:
the Federal Republic of Germany.
   Seated behind the nameplate will be Kohl, architect of one of
the most dramatic episodes in modern European history: German
reunification.
   Attesting to Kohl's elevated status are plans for the German
chancellor to deliver a major address on Tuesday, the second day of
the three-day meeting.
   Kohl likely will use his address to repeat his calls for faster
economic and political integration of Europe.
   After fusing the two Germanys, Kohl now wants to be seen as a
prime mover for European unity. The Paris gathering could give him
a test of his sometimes faulted statesmanship and provide signs of
how Germany will wield its new might.
   Even before German unification, Kohl had left a strong imprint
on plans for creating a barrier-free internal market within the
European Community by 1992. And now his government is helping set
the pace for the EC's planned economic and monetary union.
   At a summit last month, EC leaders agreed on a timetable for
economic and monetary union that reflected German conditions.
   Kohl has been praised - even by his political opponents - for
the way he steered Germany to unification.
   But he sometimes disappoints his allies on key international
matters, including his reluctance earlier this year to pledge that
a united Germany would recognize Poland's western border.
   Kohl's latest difficulties in the international arena are
cropping up because of the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   The chancellor backed Willy Brandt's one-man hostage rescue
mission to Baghdad, a trip that was denounced by Washington and
some European governments.
   Early in the gulf crisis, he also faced accusations that he was
focusing on unification and other German interests at the expense
of global problems.
   Kohl has insisted that the new, united Germany will live up to
global responsibilities befitting its power.
   President Bush and the other summiteers undoubtedly will be keen
to hear from Kohl how this will be done.
   In Paris, Kohl also may face questions about his ideas on the
proper role of Germany's military.
   Kohl's defense minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, said that
Germany's armed forces in the future must be ready to help resolve
regional European conflicts.
   There will likely also be interest in Paris about Germany's
ever-expanding relationship with the Soviet Union. There are
worries among some in Western Europe that Germany is drifting from
the West.
   On Nov. 9 in Bonn, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
Kohl signed the most important German-Soviet treaty of the post-war
period.
   The document commits the two nations to intensify their
political, cultural and economic ties over the next 20 years.
   The two nations also pledged not to attack one another, and to
respect the boundaries of all European nations.

   The conventional arms treaty limits the non-nuclear
weapons of the United States, the Soviet Union and 20 other
countries, and covers European territory from the Atlantic Ocean to
the Ural Mountains.
   Here are key provisions of the Conventional Forces in Europe
treaty.

</TEXT>
<HEAD>TANKS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The treaty requires the Soviet Union to reduce the number of
tanks from about 41,000 before the treaty negotiations began in
1989 to 13,150. Moscow already has reduced its tank holdings in the
area to about 21,000, mainly by moving its best models east as
replacements for older ones. The allowable number tanks for all of
Eastern Europe will be 20,000.
   The United States and its NATO allies also will be allowed
20,000 tanks. That will require a cut of about 4,000 for NATO,
although more than 1,000 of the top-of-the-line American M1-A1
tanks already are being moved from Europe to Saudi Arabia.
   ---
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ARMORED VEHICLES:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The 32,300 armored combat vehicles now deployed by the Soviets
will be reduced to 20,000. NATO will not have to make any cuts in
this category, which includes such war-fighting machinery as the
U.S. Bradley Fighting Vehicle used to move infantry, protect
maneuvering tanks and help consolidate gains in an offensive.
   ---
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ARTILLERY:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets will be required to reduce the number of artillery
pieces, which provide the essential firepower for a combat
operation from about 52,000 to 13,175. The Soviets already have
reduced the number to 18,300.
   NATO will stay at its current level of 18,500.

<HEAD>U.S. to Continue Export Subsidies Until Others Stop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal program to subsidize U.S.
agricultural exports will be continued under the 1990 farm bill,
and the Agriculture Department says it will be used aggressively to
meet foreign competition.
   But Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says that ideally all
countries ought to do away with export subsidies. That was the
original idea going into negotiations under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade.
   For some time, however, the United States has pushed for a 90
percent reduction in export subsidies over 10 years.
   Yeutter, in Europe last week, said that if the current Uruguay
Round of talks fails, it will be another decade or so before GATT
gets to another negotiating round.
   ``We have procrastinated long enough with agricultural trade
reform,'' he said at a news conference in Bonn. ``We need to get it
under way. That means significant disciplines of export
subsidies.''
   Yeutter continued: ``We would prefer to see export subsidies
eliminated from the face of the earth insofar as agricultural trade
is concerned, as we have already done in the GATT with industrial
export subsidies.''
   The 1990 farm bill is scheduled to be sent to the White House
this week, where it will await President Bush's signature upon his
return from Europe and the Mideast.
   Meanwhile, the USDA has issued a report updating the Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP, as the subsidy arrangement is called.
   The EEP was created in 1985 to:
   -Boost U.S. agricultural exports.
   -Challenge unfair trade practices that hurt U.S. exports,
particularly those of the European Community.
   -Encourage serious negotiations on agricultural trade under
GATT.
   Under the program, U.S. exporters can get free surplus
government-owned commodities as bonuses, or subsidies, so shippers
can keep prices competitive with other countries trying to sell to
the same markets.
   The department maintains a list of countries eligible for EEP
sales, and there is a list of commodities that can qualify for the
subsidies.
   As of Oct. 1, the department had announced 110 ``initiatives''
for selling 12 different farm commodities to 73 countries. The
bonuses, or subsidies, paid to exporters since 1986 total $2.87
billion.
   The new farm bill - the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and
Trade Act of 1990 - includes reauthorization of EEP through 1995.
   ``It also continues the USDA policy of not issuing new EEP
initiatives that would adversely impact the agricultural exports of
non-subsidizing competitors,'' the report said.
   Wheat is the biggest item among the dozen commodities that are
currently on the EEP list, accounting for more than 80 percent of
the value of sales under the program.
   One-half of the total U.S. wheat exports from 1985 to 1989 were
sold under EEP subsidy arrangements. Of the $2.87 billion in EEP
subsidies paid to exporters, wheat has accounted for about $2.03
billion.
   Other items and their shares of EEP subsidies: flour, $214.5
million; feed grains, $273.5 million; semolina $12.4 million;
barley malt, $21.9 million; rice, $15.9 million; poultry feed,
$16.6 million; vegetable oil, $67.1 million; frozen poultry, $113.6
million; dairy cattle, $92.8 million, and table eggs, $12.5
million.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The National Rural Electric Cooperative
Association says federal spending cuts negotiated between Congress
and the Bush administration will erode an already faltering rural
economy if they are not reversed.
   ``We must seek more adequate loan funds for rural
electrification,'' Bob BErgland, the association's executive vice
president, said in a statement last week.
   Bergland, a former secretary of agriculture, said the Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990 imposes a further 25 percent cut in
lending by the Rural Electrification Administration, an agency of
the Agriculture Department.
   The rural program, he said, ``has already absorbed a 40 percent
reduction'' in direct loan funds over the past eight years.
``Meanwhile, other segments of the electric utility industry have
been left untouched,'' Bergland said.
   According to the association, which is the national lobbying arm
of local REA-financed electric cooperatives, its members serve more
than 25 million consumers in the most sparsely settled areas of 46
states.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Field bindweed, described as an out-of-control
morning glory, may be in for some bad times from an imported mite
from the Mediterranean.
   The mite is only one-seventy-fifth of an inch long, said
entomologist Sara S. Rosenthal of the department's Agricultural
Research Service. But it has been cleared for attacking bindweed,
which can strangle corn and other crop plants.
   Rosenthal, who works at the agency's rangeland weeds laboratory
in Bozeman, Mont., said the mites were collected near Rome and were
released in Texas and New Jersey in the spring of last year.
   The tiny mite previously had been found to eat the stems and
leaves of field bindweed and closely related plants, none of which
are farm crops.
   Preliminary reviews show the mite survived last winter and
reproduced at both the Texas and New Jersey sites, the agency said
in a report released here.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Wendell Ford is Happy to be No. 2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in a long time, Senate
Democrats have a No. 2 guy who doesn't seem to want a better job.
   Wendell H. Ford of Kentucky, at 66, is the Senate's new
assistant majority leader, replacing the ailing Alan Cranston,
D-Calif.
   Cranston, who stepped out of Ford's way because of poor health,
at one time viewed himself as presidential timber. So did his
predecessor, Robert C. Byrd. And so, too, his predecessor, Edward
M. Kennedy, who may still.
   Ford, however, has signaled no such aspirations. The third new
o. 2 leader in the Capitol in less than two years - the other two
are in the House - he's by far the most deferential.
   ``The majority leader will be the spokesman for the Senate
Democratic Party,'' he said, referring to Sen. George Mitchell,
D-Maine, nine years Ford's junior, who may have presidential
ambitions of his own one day.
   A master of the inside game of the Senate, Ford coveted the
ultimate insider's position which he now holds and plans to keep it
inside. His hope, and that of the colleagues who elected him, is
that the Senate will look a little better from the outside.
   It took more than two years for Ford to win the post. He started
late in 1988, trying to unseat Cranston in that year's
inside-the-Capitol party elections on a campaign theme of trying to
make the Senate work better.
   Ford was soundly beaten by Cranston, who had held the post since
1977. But Ford never stopped running, and Cranston's stock went
down in the wake of his ties to Charles Keating, former head of the
failed Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   Few doubt that Ford would have won last week's vote, even if
Cranston had not dropped out of the race less than a week earlier.
Ford managed to scare off a potential challenge by Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., and win the race uncontested.
   Ask Ford what he wants to do as whip, and he says he wants to do
all he can to make Mitchell's job a little easier. That's the
politically correct answer to give, and Ford makes it believable.
   Ford, a former governor of Kentucky, was first elected to the
Senate in 1974. A lot of former governors find the Senate
frustrating, the slow pace maddening, the inefficiencies compared
to the executive branch ridiculous.
   But Wendell Ford found a home.
   Over the years, he has been most vigorous in defending his home
state interests, including the tobacco, liquor and coal industries.
   He also is known for his hospitality when colleagues make an
annual pilgrimage to the Kentucky Derby. He's the kind of guy who
picks up the tab at the bar for out-of-town guests.
   And that's the way he does business in the Senate. Ford has a
strong preference for working out deals with his colleagues before
they result in full Senate blowups.
   On tobacco, for example, he was instrumental in working out a
new price support program as part of a 1986 budget compromise that
made permanent the 16-cent-a-pack federal tax on cigarettes.
   He also helped work out an eventual 8-cent additional increase
in the tobacco levy in the latest deficit-reduction package. The
increase was agreed to early in the budget talks, avoiding
political bloodshed and a possible showdown with lawmakers who were
demanding far stiffer taxes.
   Not that Ford is afraid of showdowns. In 1987, when Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., tried to end tobacco export subsidies, Ford
threatened to retaliate against federal programs that help Rhode
Island.
   From his senior position on the Energy Committee, he vowed there
would be ``blood on the carpet of the Senate'' if Western states
succeeded in getting a coal slurry pipeline to help deliver their
coal to markets to the South and East.
   Those would be tough positions to defend if Ford were running
for a national office. But they surely haven't hurt him in
Kentucky, where he won his last election in 1986 with a state
record 74 percent of the vote.
   Ford's style would give one the impression that he shies away
from the big issues of the day, but that's not the case.
   Asked last week about the situation in the Persian Gulf, Ford
stated his strong preference for giving the economic sanctions more
time to work - lots more time, a year or more. ``Vietnam with
sand'' was his description of the risk of war.
   Not surprisingly, Ford's position was right in line with
majority leader Mitchell's, a comfortable place especially if
you're comfortable being No. 2.

   One police officer was killed and three
wounded in a two-hour shootout between city and federal police
sparked by a dispute over whether federal officers could take guns
into a saloon, a news agency reported.
   Army troops intervened and ended the battle early Saturday in
Culiacan, about 600 miles northwest of Mexico City, the
government-owned Notimex news agency said Sunday.
   Manuela Ruiz Arce of the local prosecutor's office said six
federal judicial policemen tried to take their guns into a local
bar and city police objected.
   A federal officer identified only as Francisco N. was killed and
that two federal agents and a city policeman were wounded, Notimex
reported.
   Federal police are in charge of investigating drug crimes.
   The agency said both police agencies have refused to comment on
the matter.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First lady Barbara Bush says she believes Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein will ``see the wisdom'' of withdrawing
from occupied Kuwait before the Persian Gulf crisis escalates into
war.
   Speaking Sunday with reporters on Air Force One, Mrs. Bush said
she was looking forward to spending Thanksgiving with U.S. troops
deployed to the Persian Gulf region - except for one thing.
   ``We're visiting American troops and I hate to have them see me
in pants,'' she said. She said she would wear comfortable
``Kennebunkport clothes'' in the desert like those she wears at the
first family's vacation home on the Maine coast.
   Mrs. Bush chatted as she and the president flew here from
Germany, where they had visited German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   She was wearing a silver bracelet which read ``Operation Desert
Shield - a Call to Freedom.'' She said it was a gift from her
daughter, Dorothy LeBlond, and that she had been wearing it for the
past two weeks.
   ``I think it's a nice reminder. It snags on everything I wear.
It cuts into me at night. It reminds me. I think it's important.''
   Asked if she believed the Persian Gulf standoff would result in
a war, she replied, ``No. So much of the world is united against
Iraq that I think he (Saddam) will see the wisdom of it.''
   Asked if she were concerned for the safety of the president and
herself when they visit U.S. forces so close to the Kuwait and Iraq
borders.
   ``I honestly wouldn't go on the trip if I thought it wasn't
safe,'' she said.
   ``We'd rather be home for Thanksgiving, but so would 200,000
other people,'' she added, referring to the troops in the region.
   She and her husband plan to make three separate stops to share
Thanksgiving with U.S. forces, including on a naval vessel in the
gulf. Did she really intend to eat three separate dinners?
   ``You know, I was built for the job,'' said the full-figured
first lady.

<HEAD>Stringent Thai Media Decree Repealed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has repealed a
14-year-old decree that allowed police to summarily shut down
publications in the name of national security or law and order,
state radio said today.
   Police now need a court order.
   The decree was scrapped effective Sunday in an order issued by
Thailand's constitutional monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and
countersigned by Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan.
   The repealed decree was issued on Oct. 21, 1976 by the
government of Prime Minister Thanin Kraivichien, which was
installed by the military following a bloody coup.
   Journalists united to lobby for the decree's repeal after police
invoked it in February to shut the Naew Na newspaper for publishing
a sensationalist headline about the murder of Saudi diplomats in
Bangkok.
   Police had argued that the headline was damaging to Thai-Saudi
relations.
   ``The Thai press has already been known as possibly the most
free in Southeast Asia, a major plus for Thailand in the eyes of
the international community,'' the Bangkok Post said in an
editorial today.
   ``This freedom is made all the more wholesome now that the most
serious legal hindrance has been removed.''
   It said Thailand is now in an enhanced position to become the
new regional center for the printing of foreign newspapers and
magazines.

   The dollar fell against the yen on Monday, while
share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange advanced moderately.
   The dollar closed at 128.95 yen, down 0.78 yen from last
Friday's close of 129.73 yen. It opened at 128.95 yen and ranged
between 128.75 yen and 129.17 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 346.53
points, or 1.50 percent, to close at 23,518.16. The index had shed
315.85 points on Friday.
   Yasushi Ueda, a dealer with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, said the
dollar met slight selling pressure in early trading in reaction to
Friday's easing of interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board
- in addition to news that Iraq will free all its remaining foreign
hostages by March 25.
   The dollar regained some ground toward the morning close because
of its actual demand, Ueda said.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Sunday the ``guests,'' as it
calls the captives, would be allowed depart beginning December 25
if nothing ``mars the atmosphere of peace.''
   ``The announcement will not become an incentive for further
yen-buying because the Iraqi move was widely seen in the market as
a strategy that will not necessarily lead to a withdrawal from
Kuwait,'' Ueda said.
   In the stock market, the Nikkei index started higher in a
favorable reaction to the relaxing of U.S. interest rates and some
expectations toward peace in the Middle East with Iraq's
hostage-release announcement, securities analysts said.
   A dealer at Nomura Securities said the index rose on small-lot
buying in a broad front.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds was higher at 85.26, compared with
Friday's close of 84.77. Their yield fell to 7.650 percent from
7.760 percent.

<TEXT>
   Robert Hofstadter, who won the Nobel Prize
in physics in 1961 for determining the precise size and shape of
the particles that make up the nucleus of the atom, has died at age
75.
   Hofstadter, who died of heart failure Saturday at his Stanford
home, had taught at Stanford University from 1950 to 1985 and was
director of the university's High Energy Physics Laboratory from
1967 to 1974.
   He was honored by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for
determining the size and shape of the proton and the neutron. He
shared the Nobel with Rudolf Mossbauer of West Germany.
   Hofstadter and colleagues worked for 10 years to probe nuclei by
directing a beam of electrons from a 220-foot linear accelerator.
They determined that the neutron and the proton have an average
radius of 24 to 32 quadrillionths of a inch.
   Born in New York, Hofstadter graduated from City College of New
York and received a master's and doctorate from Princeton
University.
   ``I've known people who could run rings around him in scientific
arguments, but he's usually the one who ends up being right,'' 1981
Nobel laureate and former Stanford colleague Arthur Schawlow once
said.
   In World War II, Hofstadter was a physicist at the National
Bureau of Standards, where he helped develop the proximity fuse, an
anti-aircraft weapon that detonated a shell when it detected
approaching objects by radar.
   In retirement, he became interested in astronomy and contributed
to a gamma ray observatory that is scheduled to be sent up in a
space shuttle next spring.
   He also conducted research into coronary angiography, a
technique to explore heart functions with radioactive substances
instead of more dangerous and painful catheters.
   Survivors include his wife, Nancy; a son; two daughters; a
brother; a sister, and two grandsons.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<HEAD>Wild Turkeys are Back in Massachusetts for Thanksgiving</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts hunters got their first
autumn opportunity since the 1800s to pot one of the wily birds
that were on the first Thanksgiving table in 1621.
   The wild turkey is back in the land of the Pilgrims, less than
20 years after the first were reintroduced, and last week about
7,000 hunters using bows or shotguns took part in a six-day turkey
season in the Berkshires.
   Final totals were not yet in Sunday, but just 200 of the 8,000
to 10,000 birds now found in western Massachusetts were bagged in
the first two days, said James Cardoza of the state Division of
Fisheries and Wildlife.
   Unlike their domestic cousins, wild turkeys have sharp eyesight
and first-rate hearing, and are masters of the duck and scramble. A
flock that can seem to fill a clearing in a blink of an eye can
disappear just as fast.
   ``It takes an awful lot of effort and skill,'' Cardoza said.
   Limited spring hunting has been allowed since 1981.
   Cardoza launched Massachusetts' wild turkey repopulation efforts
in 1972 by trapping 37 birds in western New York. Since 1979 he has
been catching and moving some of the birds from the Berkshires into
forested areas of eastern and coastal Massachusetts, including
Plymouth, the home of the Pilgrims.
   In 1621, four wild turkeys were part of the Pilgrims' first
Thanksgiving feast. The birds disappeared from the state before the
Civil War.
   A big reason for their resurgence is the reforestation of the
state that had been largely cleared for farming in the 1800s,
Cardoza said. ``They like mature woodlands where they can find
acorns and beechnuts,'' he said.
   Massachusetts is not alone in its success. In 1952 there were
about 320,000 turkeys in the United States. The population has
increased to about 3 million, and they can be found in practically
every state, Cardoza said.

<TEXT>
   Four bombs thrown by unidentified
assailants exploded today at the home of the Philippine justice
secretary today in what the official called an apparent
assassination attempt.
   One struck the wall near the window of the second-story bedroom
where Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon, his wife Violetta and two
young sons were sleeping.
   The other blasts heavily damaged a wall around the house,
shattered windows, overturned furniture and blasted a
nine-foot-deep hole in the yard, Drilon said.
   Drilon said he and his family were sleeping when the blasts
occurred at 4:05 a.m. in the fashionable Greenhills district of
suburban San Juan, about one mile from the national police
headquarters.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, and Drilon said
he was unsure who threw the bombs. Drilon said at least one of the
bombs contained the plastic explosive C-4, often used by right-wing
military extremists.
   He said the bombs were so powerful that they were apparently not
designed simply to scare him.
   Drilon was appointed justice secretary on Dec. 31 as part of a
Cabinet shakeup following a bloody coup attempt earlier in the
month. He had served as labor secretary since 1987.
   Drilon also serves as chairman of the Cabinet Security
Committee, which advises President Corazon Aquino on national
security issues.
   The Manila and The Manila Times reported today that military
intelligence expects right-wing extremists to launch a new coup
attempt between Nov. 30 and Dec. 10.
   The newspapers quoted unnamed military sources as saying the
plan called for coordinated uprisings in northern and southern
provinces directed by renegade Commodore Domingo Calajate, a leader
of last December's failed putsch.
   Last month, mutineers staged a three-day uprising in Mindanao
island which the military said was to have been the trigger for a
series of nationwide revolts.
   The mutiny ended Oct. 6 when mutiny leader Col. Alexander Noble
surrendered and was arrested.

   Some people in this tiny town would
like to forget it was the birthplace of The Order, a violent white
supremacist group. But Selkirk High School language teacher Eva
Gayle Six won't let them.
   For a student production, she chose ``The Foreigner,'' a play
poking fun at white supremacist beliefs.
   ``If we can finally laugh at these foolish ideas, that means the
pain has passed,'' Mrs. Six said.
   About 80 people - a third of the town's population - attended on
opening night Thursday, she said.
   ``It was an extremely receptive audience,'' she said Friday. The
three-day run ended Saturday.
   The Order was founded in 1983 as a violent offshoot of the Aryan
Nations sect near Hayden Lake, Idaho. Its members hoped to turn the
Northwest into a whites-only bastion.
   Blamed for the machine-gun slaying of Denver radio host Alan
Berg, armored-car robberies and other crimes, the sect fell apart
after leader Robert Mathews died in 1984 in a shootout with FBI
agents. Several members have since been convicted of various
crimes.
   ``The Foreigner'' is a 1983 farce about a shy Englishman who
pretends he cannot speak English while spending a few days at a
backwater Georgia fishing resort. It pokes fun at the Ku Klux Klan.
   ``I don't think people could go to this play and not be reminded
of (The Order), because it really did happen,'' Mrs. Six said.
   Most people in this community of 250 in Washington's
northeastern corner do not share the neo-Nazi group's beliefs,
including Mathews' parents and two brothers.
   His mother, Una Mathews, said a comedy about racism could help
clear the air and improve the town's reputation.
   ``There's nothing like poking fun at something to show the
absurdity of it,'' said Mrs. MAthews. She said she remains baffled
by her son's actions.
   Others questioned the wisdom of reviving old controversies.
   ``It's over. It's done,'' Mayor Lee ``Teen'' McGowan said.
``Nobody cares. They've forgotten about it.
   ``If you want to come back in 20 years and dig it up, OK. But
now, the hurt is too recent.''
   Other racist groups remain active in the Pacific Northwest, and
Mathews has sympathizers in the area. None protested at the play,
Mrs. Six said.
   ``I would not have done this play six years ago and maybe not
even four years ago because there was too much pain,'' she said.
``But enough time has passed now that we can laugh at the stupidity
of those ideas.''

   When Thanksgiving Day chefs don't want to wing it
or stick their necks out, they can talk turkey with experts stuffed
with the right cooking information.
   They can dial the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line, which takes
questions from harried holiday cooks. Callers range from young
brides to Army cooks to a blind man from Norfolk, Va., who was
talked through the cooking steps by a hotline staffer.
   Forty-five Chicago-area home economists and nutritionists
provide the turkey tips from an office in suburban Downers Grove.
The service was started by Swift-Eckrich, which has the trademark
on Butterball turkeys.
   ``Every year we have a three-day training session for them,''
said Jean Schnelle, Talk-Line director. ``Staff members have a
notebook with 66 categories of types of questions in it.''
   Since opening in 1981, the hotline has handled about 1 million
calls, including 260,000 last year.
   ``The most common one is `How do you recommend we roast the
turkey to get it picture perfect?''' she said Friday. Answer: Use
the conventional open pan method, with the uncovered turkey oiled
and sitting on a rack in a 325-degree oven.
   ``It's not only the best way. It's the easiest way,'' Schnelle
said.
   Other questions concern thawing, food safety, meat thermometer
insertion and stuffing.
   Some phone with colorful stories.
   A Baltimore woman said she had cooked her turkey without
removing the plastic covering, causing it to melt into the skin. A
Philadelphia woman left a red rubber glove, used for cleaning, in
the turkey. A cook from Lawrence, Kan., asked, ``How do I turn my
oven on?''
   The hotline number is 1-800-323-4848 and is open today through
Wednesday from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m., and on Thanksgiving Day from 7
a.m. until 7 p.m. It's also open Monday through Friday until Dec.
21 from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m.

<HEAD>Report: Iraq Capable Of Developing Nuclear Bomb Within 3 to 5
Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq is capable of developing a nuclear bomb
within three to five years and has between 10 and 30 chemical
warheads for its ballistic missiles, a respected Israeli think tank
says in a new report.
   The assessment is based on Iraq's possession of 26 pounds of
enriched uranium that France supplied when it was assisting Saddam
Hussein's nuclear program, said Danny Leshem of Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, which published
the report Sunday.
   Leshem said, however, that development of a nuclear warhead may
take Iraq until the end of the decade.
   Iraq has completed the development of chemical warheads and
``now they are starting production and equipment ... this is the
beginning of the equipping stage,'' Leshem said on Israel radio.
   Leshem said the Iraqis have between 10 to 30 units ``that they
perhaps can fire.''
   Iraq, he said, has two missiles that can carry chemical
warheads, both modified versions of the Soviet Scud missile.
   ``There is al-Hussein with a range of 600 to 650 kilometers
(370-400 miles) and al-Abbas with a range of 850 to 900 kilometers
(530-560 miles) ... Al-Hussein was fired during the Iran-Iraq war
and al-Abbas is apparently entering into service this year,''
Leshem said.
   Iraq has repeatedly threatened to attack Israel with chemical
weapons in response to a U.S. military move in the Persian Gulf
crisis. Last month, Israel began distributing gas masks to its 4.7
million citizens.

   Gasoline at the pump got cheaper by nearly a

just under $1.46, a national survey found.
   ``This is the first significant change in the downward direction

Sunday.
   The average for all grades of gasoline was $1.45.98 a gallon, a
Drop of 0.94 cents since the Nov. 2 survey.
   ``The biggest reason for the drop is that crude oil price cuts
have been working their way into the system,'' Ms. Lundberg said.
   Gasoline has gone up about 28 cents a gallon since the invasion
Aug. 2, according to the survey.

<TEXT>
   An insurance executive authorities
thought faked his death to avoid prosecution and collect $4 million
in insurance benefits was killed in a plane crash two years ago, an
autopsy confirmed.
   A state medical examiner said dental records Sunday proved the
body recovered from Lake Martin on Friday was that of 47-year-old
Blan Stewart of Huntsville, who disappeared while flying a small
plane in 1988.
   Prosecutors had contended the insurance executive faked his
death to collect some $4 million and to avoid prosecution on
charges of stealing about $590,000 from clients.
   Insurance companies had posted a $100,000 reward for information
on whether he was dead or alive.
   The plane and Stewart's body were found under 65 feet of water
during a private search arranged by his widow, Sarah ``Robin''
Stewart.
   He died of drowning and injuries suffered when the plane slammed
into the lake, said the medical examiner, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``I assume we'll close the book on the case,'' said Larry
Childers, spokesman for the state attorney general's office.
   Once a death certificate is issued, Mrs. Stewart can start the
process of collecting the insurance money, said John Heacock, her
attorney.
   A judge in May had refused Mrs. Stewart's attempt to have her
husband declared dead. The judge heard testimony from a man who
claimed to have seen the plane flying low after air traffic
controllers lost contact with Stewart.
   The attorney general's office had said at least two people
claimed to have seen Stewart in the Virgin Islands and South
Carolina long after he disappeared.
   ``I have to assume, like most do, that people make mistakes,''
said Childers.

   For her part, Thatcher accused Saddam of ``the worst brutality
and evil.''
   The only way to avoid a shooting war in the Persian Gulf, she
said, ``would be for Saddam Hussein to withdraw, quickly,
totally.''
   ``Most people understand evil has to be stopped. Either he
withdraws, or the military option has to be used.''
   ``Unless he leaves, he will have to be made to leave by force.
He plays with human beings as if they were pawns. Unless you stop
this man, there will be no peace i;n the world let alone in the

   She said she and Bush see eye-to-eye on the Persian Gulf and the

withdraw unconditionally.
   ``There can be no comproimse. Y ou cannot reward aggression.''
   Bush said he hoped discuss the Persian Gulf when he meets later
today with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

   Vocational students who graduate from the
Lubbock Independent School District leave with diplomas and come
with warranties.
   Beginning at the end of this school year, would-be auto
mechanics, welders, cabinet makers and cosmetologists will graduate
with guarantees aimed at making them more employable.
   The school district promises to provide additional training if a
former student is found to be lacking in basic skills within two
years after graduation.
   Superintendent Mike Moses said he hopes the district is ``on the
cutting edge of something here.''
   ``We hear a lot in Lubbock that we need a skilled and trained
work force,'' he said. ``We are confident our graduates have the
basic skills that they need to do well on their first job.''
   School officials said the greatest need for retraining would
most likely come in areas where technology changes rapidly, such as
automotive engineering.

   Cata Fulkerson needed a few
good men to fill out her wedding party. Naturally, she turned to
the Marines.
   Cata and her husband, Erik, wanted to have their wedding and
reception at the El Adobe Restaurant. There was one problem: The
restaurant required 150 guests and the Fulkersons had invited 110.
   The Mission Viejo couple considered donating the extra dinners
to charity, but the red tape was too much.
   Military officials at nearby Camp Pendleton were less daunting,
allowing members of the Marines 5th Regiment to attend. The unit
awaits deployment to Saudi Arabia.
   Forty Marines in spiffy dress uniforms went to Saturday's
ceremony and stayed for dinner and dancing.
   ``It was a beautiful wedding,'' said Gunnery Sgt. Humberto
Gonzalez.
   The ceremony was the second for the Fulkersons, who were married
Aug. 11 in an Indian ceremony in NEw Mexico but wanted to have a
party with family and friends.

<HEAD>Boy Beats Rare Leukemia With Umbilical Cord Blood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 4-year-old with a rare form of
leukemia once considered incurable has apparently beaten the
disease after being given a transfusion of umbilical cord blood
from his baby sister, doctors say.
   Michael Sancilio of Virginia Beach left Johns Hopkins Hospital
in Baltimore on Saturday three months after becoming the first
leukemia patient to undergo the experimental transplant.
   ``Although doctors are reluctant to say Michael is cured,
Michael appears to have defeated a rare form of leukemia for which
previously existed no known cure,'' Virginia BEach General Hospital
said in a statement.
   Doctors there had collected so-called stem cells from his
sister's umbilical cord for transplant in Baltimore. Umbilical
blood, usually discarded at birth, is rich in stem cells, which
multiply rapidly to form bone marrow.
   Doctors gave Michael five tablespoons of the blood. Within one
month, he began producing healthy bone marrow, doctors said.
   ``What we are viewing this afternoon is nothing short of a
miracle,'' Dr. Leslie Wasserman Jr. said Sunday.
   ``God deserves all the credit,'' said Michael's grandmother,
Rachel Sancilio. ``I prayed for a miracle. It was the most
devastating thing. My heart goes out to any family that has to go
through something like this.''
   Umbilical cord blood transplants have been performed three other
times, once in Cincinnati and twice in France, to treat a different
disease, Fanconi's anemia.
   Leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Eight months
ago, Michael was diagnosed with a form known as chronic myelogenous
leukemia, which cannot be controlled with drugs and usually kills
within a year of diagnosis.
   The boy's sister, Christina, was born May 1. Michael's blood
type did not match hers, but the siblings were otherwise
compatible, and doctors found that he was not overly likely to
reject the umbilical cord blood.
   Because of the procedure, Michael has ``another chance at life''
- and a new blood type, the hospital said.
   Doctors will not know for about two years whether the boy is
cured. Christina is healthy.

   President Bush demanded today that Iraq's Saddam
Hussein ``turn tail 180 degrees'' and withdraw from Kuwait. British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Saddam ``has to be removed by
force'' unless he pulls out soon.
   The two leaders, meeting over breakfast before a 34-nation
summit, underscored their hardline stand against Iraq's aggression.
   The president also dismissed Saddam's proposal to begin
releasing foreign hostages beginning on Christmas. ``This cynicism
of starting to release them on Christmas Day will be seen by the
world as a total ploy,'' Bush said.
   Opening a joint news conference with Mrs. Thatcher, Bush said,
``Not surprisingly, we see eye to eye on the gulf.''
   For her part, Thatcher accused Saddam of ``the worst brutality
and evil.''
   The only way to avoid a shooting war in the Persian Gulf, she
said, ``would be for Saddam Hussein to withdraw, quickly,
totally.''
   ``Most people understand evil has to be stopped. Either he
withdraws, or the military option has to be used,'' the prime
minister said.
   ``Unless he leaves, he will have to be made to leave by force.
He plays with human beings as if they were pawns,'' she said.
``Unless you stop this man, there will be no peace in the world let
alone in the Middle East.''
   She said she and Bush see eye-to-eye on the Persian Gulf and the
need to use force to drive Saddam from Kuwait if he does not
withdraw unconditionally.
   ``There can be no compromise,'' Mrs. Thatcher said. ``You cannot
reward aggression.''
   Bush said he hoped discuss the Persian Gulf when he meets later
today with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Asked why Gorbachev seemed to me more optimistic about a
peaceful resolution of the situation than he was, Bush said:
   ``I will be seeing him, and Mr. Gorbachev has been very solid in
support of the United Nations. So I'm anxious to know if there's
something new that he's thinking of.''
   He said the reduction of tensions in Europe between superpowers
will help send an even stronger signal to Saddam of allied unity to
drive him from Kuwait.
   ``You've heard Prime Minister Thatcher,'' Bush said. ``I feel
the same way.''
   ``The longer he focuses on holding innocents against their will,
the more he points to his own brutality,'' Bush said.
   ``There will be no concession,'' Bush said. ``We are ratcheting
up pressure on this man. And I hope that as soon as he understands
that he cannot prevail, that he will do that which he did in
Iran...turn tail 180 degrees and turn east.''
   He was referring to Iraq's withdrawal from Iran as the beginning
of the current confrontation with the West. Bush added that Saddam
now should ``turn 180 degrees and head north,'' out of Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, Bush was asked about Mrs. Thatcher's challenge from
within her own conservative party in British elections on Tuesday.
   ``I stay out of all this, but we have a superb relationship with
Mrs. Thatcher,'' he said. Asked if she would survive the challenge,
Mrs. Thatcher said: ``I most earnestly believe so.''

   The arms-reduction treaty signed today by leaders
of the Eastern and Western military alliances would slash
non-nuclear forces in Europe and eliminate the Cold War fear of a
surprise ground attack.
   Negotiators sought in vain for 15 years to make headway on the
Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, but swiftly concluded it over
the past 20 months as the Soviet military empire collapsed.
   ``We are putting an end to the previous age,'' French President
Francois Mitterrand said in signing the accord before a glittering
assembly of presidents, premiers and foreign ministers at the
Elysee Palace.
   NATO and Warsaw Pact negotiators initialed the 160-page document
in Vienna on Sunday, clearing the way for President Bush, Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev and other leaders to sign the accord at
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Under the treaty, more than 100,000 pieces of military hardware
would be scrapped, prompting some to call the pact the formal end
of the Cold War.
   ``No battle in the history of mankind ... destroyed such an
immense number of tanks, armored combat vehicles, artillery and
combat aircraft,'' Soviet negotiator Oleg A. Grinevsky told
reporters in Vienna.
   U.S. negotiator James Woolsey said the accord ``makes it a
matter of many, many months instead of a few hours in which any
country could think of a surprise attack.''
   The agreement sets no limits on combat troops, because the
reunification of Germany and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact
outpaced the talks. Negotiators are to reconvene Nov. 29 to discuss
troop levels.
   Most of the 16 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and six countries in the Warsaw Pact already have taken advantage
of the reduced tensions to cut their armed forces. Bush last month
announced plans to withdraw 40,000 U.S. troops from Europe, and
later ordered an additional 100,000 moved to Saudi Arabia, cutting
the American ground force level on the continent by half.
   Because most of the troops and armaments in Europe were under
Kremlin control, the Warsaw Pact will register the first financial
benefits.
   Gorbachev has presented the Supreme Soviet with a 10-year plan
to make the military ``less of a burden on the state and more
efficient at the same time,'' Soviet Chief of Staff Mikhail
Moiseyev said in an article published by the army newspaper
Krasnaya Zvezda.
   The massive disarmament will be carried out under the CFE treaty
and the proposed Strategic Force Reduction Treaty to cut nuclear
arsenals by up to 50 percent, Moiseyev said.
   Under the conventional force treaty, the nations will have 40
months after the last nation ratifies the accord to destroy the
specified weapons.
   From the start of the Cold War and the birth of NATO in 1949 and
the Warsaw Pact in 1955, the military landscape of Western Europe
has been dominated by fear of a communist bloc ground assault.
   To eliminate that, the treaty limiting the weapons of 22
countries from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains requires
the Soviets to drastically reduce their forces, including:
   -Tanks, from about 41,000 before the treaty negotiations began
to 13,150. Moscow already has reduced its tank holdings in the
territory covered by the treaty to about 21,000, mainly by moving
its best models east.
   The allowable number tanks for all of Eastern Europe will be
20,000. The United States and its NATO allies also will be allowed
20,000 tanks. That will require a cut of about 4,000 for NATO,
although more than 1,000 of the top-of-the-line U.S. M1-A1 tanks
already are being moved to Saudi Arabia.
   -Armored combat vehicles, from the 32,300 now deployed by the
Soviets to 30,000. NATO will not have to make any cuts in this
category.
   -Artillery pieces, providing the essential firepower for a
Combat operation, from about 52,000 for the Soviets before the
negotiations, to 13,175. The Soviets already are down to 18,300.
NATO will stay at 18,500.
   Those three weapon categories - tanks, armored combat vehicles
and artillery - are especially important to the military balance in
Europe because they form the core of non-nuclear offense for both
the Soviets and NATO.

<HEAD>Researcher: Lab Test Indentifies `Yuppie Flu'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have developed a blood test
to distinguish sufferers of chronic fatigue syndrome - or ``yuppie
flu'' - from those feeling run-down for other reasons, a scientist
says.
   The test checks levels of white blood cells, AIDS researcher Jay
Levy said Sunday at a national conference on the chronic fatigue
syndrome. He led the group that developed the test at the
University of California at San Francisco.
   Levy said most of the 120 chronic fatigue patients tested at the
university had abnormal levels of three types of white blood cells
produced when the body fights a virus.
   No one virus was present in all the patients, but Levy said
levels of those three cells were either consistently high or
consistently low in most of the patients.
   Therefore, he said, a check of those white blood cells, plus a
review of the patient's medical history, could determine whether a
person has chronic fatigue syndrome. None of the 80 healthy people
studied had abnormal levels, Levy said.
   Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by exhaustion, joint
and muscle aches, fever and other problems that persist for more
than six months and often for years. Its cause is unknown.
   Tens of thousands of Americans believe they have chronic fatigue
syndrome, although the extent of it is unclear. It was dubbed
``yuppie flu'' because it has been widely reported among
well-educated women in their 30s and 40s.
   The weekend conference, titled ``Unraveling the Mystery,'' drew
400 eople, including researchers and people afflicted with the
ailment.
   Most researchers now agree the illness stems from immune system
abnormalities, not depression or other psychological factors, Levy
said.
   He called it ``the disease of the '90s.''
   ``This is going to be the 10 years that we see the greatest
advancement in understanding this disease,'' he said.
   He suggested the name be changed to ``chronic immune activation
syndrome'' because research indicates that patients' immune systems
are chronically ``activated,'' as if fighting a continuing viral
infection.
   With most viral infections, such as the flu, the immune system
fights vigorously, causing fatigue and muscle aches. But it quiets
down when the virus is killed. In chronic fatigue syndrome, the
immune system stays on the attack, causing the symptoms to persist,
he said.
   Besides trying to determine the cause, researchers are
struggling to learn how the illness is transmitted and whether it
is contagious.
   Dr. Walter Gunn, a researcher with the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta, said an inter-agency committee had been formed
to determine the extent of the illness.

   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev joined European leaders today in signing a historic
treaty that cuts conventional forces in Europe and pushes the Cold
War deeper into history.
   ``It is the farthest-reaching arms agreement in history and it
signals the new world order that is emerging,'' Bush said in a
glittering signing ceremony.
   The long-sought agreement to destroy tens of thousands of tanks,
artillery and armored combat vehicles in Europe is the most
sweeping arms accord in history. It was signed as prelude to a
34-nation summit originally called to discuss European security in
the post Cold War era, but shadowed by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``We are putting an end to the previous age,'' French President
Francois Mitterrand declared as he put his signature to the treaty
documents. One by one the other leaders followed suit, with
Gorbachev the last one to wield the pen. As the treaty was passed
back to Mitterrand, the roomful of leaders applauded their work.
   ``This reduces to practically nil the tensions that have
existed,'' said Bush.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas described the meeting as
the most important international event since World War II and said
it will ``design the architecture of Europe for the century to
come.''
   U.S. officials view the summit more modestly, describing the
34-nation forum primarily as a device for promoting political
freedom, human rights and East-West cooperation.
   With the extraordinary assembly of government leaders, French
authorities mobilized rooftop sharpshooters, anti-terrorist units
and 10,000 police officers to provide security - and also to clear
paths for convoys of limousines. Parisians braced for severe
traffic disruptions.
   Domestic political crises faced by some leaders offered a
dramatic sideshow. Gorbachev left behind a country staggering under
political and economic chaos. Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher of
Britain and Michel Rocard of France face Parliament votes that
conceivably could topple them during the summit.
   Yet, the gathering gave Bush an opportunity to exercise his
personal diplomacy to solidify support for his Persian Gulf
policies. OFficials said the president would seek backing for a
United Nations resolution authorizing military action to force Iraq
out of Kuwait.
   Bush and Thatcher emerged from a breakfast meeting today warning
that fighting might erupt unless Iraq's Saddam Hussein withdraws
from Kuwait.
   Bush demanded that Saddam ``turn tail 180 degrees'' and Mrs.
Thatcher said the Iraqi president ``has to be removed by force''
unless he pulls out soon.
   At a joint news conference with the British prime minister, Bush
said, ``Not surprisingly, we see eye to eye on the gulf.''
   The three-day summit will end Wednesday with the signing of an
agreement to institute high-level political consultations of the 34
nations and establish a conflict prevention center in Vienna.
Afterward, Bush will fly to the Middle East for a Thanksgiving Day
visit with U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
   On Sunday, Bush conferred with French President Francois
Mitterrand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, both of whom stress a
non-military outcome to the gulf crisis.
   Yet, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said many countries
support a military option if Iraq does not withdraw voluntarily.
   ``I'm not aware of any countries, going back to the very
beginning of this crisis, who have taken the position under any and
all circumstances that the option of force should be ruled out,''
Baker said.
   Bush, visiting with Kohl, said, ``We're not ruling out any
options, we're not ruling any options in.'' The chancellor urged
that ``everything be exhausted that there is to exhaust with
negotiations.''
   Baker met Sunday with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze. Afterward, both declined to say whether the Soviet
Union would back a United Nations resolution authorizing the use of
force against Iraq.
   Gorbachev said Sunday that ``new ideas'' are emerging to avert
war. The Soviet leader, in Rome to visit Pope John Paul II, did not
elaborate.
   Bush, hop-scotching from Czechoslovakia to Germany to France,
said the arms agreement he was signing today ``seems to be
overshadowed by what's happening in the gulf. But it is a
significant milestone.''
   His assessment paled beside that of Oleg A. Grinevsky, Soviet
ambassador to the talks.
   ``From this treaty, the Soviet Union is ceasing to become a
militarized state with all the consequences of that - economic,
political and social,'' Grinevsky said.
   The treaty on non-nuclear forces was initialed in Vienna on
Sunday by negotiators from the 16-member NATO alliance and the
six-member Warsaw Pact, which is rapidly disintegrating as a
military alliance.
   The 160-page accord limits each side to 20,000 main battle
tanks, 30,000 armored combat vehicles, 20,000 artillery pieces,
6,800 fighter planes and 2,000 combat helicopters. It will cover a
2.5 million square mile area stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to
the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union.
   The accord also regulates troop movements from both alliances
and permits mutual inspections across Europe.
   Because of the Soviets' big edge in conventional weapons, Moscow
will have to destroy many more weapons than the NATO alliance.

   A soldier who sought conscientious
objector status was demoted and confined to his barracks for
refusing an order to bear arms during training.
   The Army had sent 20-year-old Pvt. Alfred Edwin Escquibel from a
desk job to Fort Campbell, Ky., for rifle drills shortly after
denying his request for conscientious objector last month.
   When an instructor ordered him last week to pick up an M-16
rifle, ``I told her my story, and said, `With all due respect,
ma'am, I can't do that,''' the soldier said in a telephone
interview Sunday from Fort Campbell.
   The helicopter mechanic was demoted from private first class to
private 2 during a hearing at Fort Campbell on Saturday.
   He was ordered to forfeit $405 a month in pay for two months,
confined to his barracks for 30 days and sentenced to extra duty
for refusing the order.
   Esquibel, a Roman Catholic from Albuquerque, said he told his
M-16 instructor that for religious and moral reasons he could not
bear arms.
   ``I felt like the only reason they were sending me down there
(to Fort CAmpbell) was to get me in trouble,'' Esquibel said. ``I
think they might've thought to themselves, `Let's see how sincere
he is.'''
   The soldier said he filed a request last week for discharge on
grounds of ``erroneous enlistment.'' He said he was assured he
would not be ordered to pick up a weapon until his request for
discharge is either denied or approved.
   Esquibel's unit has been shipped to the Persian Gulf as part of
the U.S. buildup there.
   Esquibel, who enlisted in 1989, said he told his recruiter of
his objection to guns and was assured he would be assigned a
non-combat role after basic training.
   The soldier said he filed for conscientious objector status in
August 1989 after realizing he would be required to use a weapon.

<TEXT>
   The dollar declined against the Japanese yen in
thin trading today in Tokyo, while share prices closed higher for
the first time in four trading sessions.
   The dollar closed at 128.95 yen, down 0.78 yen from Friday's
finish of 129.73 yen. It also opened at 128.95 yen, and ranged
between 128.75 yen and 129.17 yen. The dollar had edged up a total
of 0.96 yen in the three previous trading days.
   Dealers said the dollar was being sold in early trading on news
that the Federal Reserve eased interest rates Friday and that Iraq
had offered to free all remaining foreign hostages.
   Lower interest rates make a currency less attractive to
investors. In addition, the dollar's role as a safe haven in times
of international tension would be diminished by peaceful moves by
Iraq.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Sunday the captives held in
Iraq would be allowed to depart beginning Dec. 25 if nothing ``mars
the atmosphere of peace.'' The Bush administration has dismissed
the offer as a ploy.
   The dollar rebounded later. Dealers said the Iraqi news was not
considered sufficient to trigger major dollar selling, and the
interest rate easing had been anticipated.
   Some $8.48 billion changed hands in spot trading, up from $5.97
billion Friday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which had shed
315.85 points Friday, gained 346.53, or 1.50 percent, closing at
23,518.16.
   ``News of the Iraqi move to free hostages turned out to be a
good factor in the market,'' said Nobuyuki Fujimoto, an analyst
with Nikko Securities.
   But Fujimoto added that it was hard to say whether the market
had gained confidence. The recent pattern has been a gain early in
the week followed by declines later in the week.
   A total of 300 million shares were traded on the first section,
down from the previous session's 313 million shares.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 85.32 as of 3 a.m. EST from
Friday's close of 84.77. Their yield fell to 7.640 percent from
7.760 percent.

   Demonstrators angered by rationing and
shortages are rallying behind opposition leaders who have told
Socialist Premier Andrei Lukanov to resign by Thursday or face
general unrest.
   But Lukanov said leaving office under pressure ``would be a
betrayal of democracy.'' There have been two attempted attacks on
Lukanov's home recently.
   On Sunday, about 70,000 protesters outside Alexander Nevsky
Cathedral cheered wildly as opposition leaders issued the Thursday
deadline for the leader of the long-ruling party and his government
to step down.
   The Socialist Party was created last spring when the Communist
Party dissolved and renamed itself after the November ouster of
hard-line leader Todor Zhivkov.
   The Socialists won a parliamentary majority in June's free
elections with promises to abandon Marxism. But the Lukanov
government has proven ineffective and his popularity has slumped
with Bulgaria's economic performance.
   ``The government's one-year credit is up. It is now time for
action,'' Petar Beron, leader of the main opposition Union of
Democratic Forces, told the crowd on Sunday.
   He promised a showdown in the 400-seat Grand National Assembly
on Thursday when a controversial budget reform package is put forth
by the Socialists.
   ``We will wait no longer ... we will vote against the
government's budget draft,'' Beron shouted from the cathedral
steps.
   The crowd had jeered and whistled when he called for patience
and a parliamentary solution. They yelled ``General strike!'' and
``Death to the Communist Party!''
   ``If the government doesn't resign on Thursday, the Socialists'
fate is in your hands,'' Beron told the crowd.
   Lukanov has pinned his political fate to the budget package,
which includes sharp price rises on 21 basic goods at a time when
Sofia stores are bare and electricity, gasoline and some foodstuffs
are rationed.
   Despite his majority in parliament, Lukanov has urged also
opposition support for the reforms, citing their national
importance. The premier is under increasing pressure from street
protests and from some factions within Socialist ranks.
   The opposition coalition is calling for a higher budget deficit
instead of higher prices that could tax Bulgaria's consumers.
   Lukanov claims more government debt would devastate Bulgaria's
national economy, already saddled by an $11 billion foreign debt
that it is having difficulty repaying.
   The Union of Democratic Forces claims it would triumph if new
elections were held.

   Tales of fear, hunger and a fading resistance in
Kuwait accompanied a group of former hostages who arrived on a
U.S.-chartered flight from Iraq today, leaving many family members
behind.
   Some of the passengers said Kuwaitis and foreigners are well
aware of the military buildup in the Persian Gulf, and hope for an
invasion.
   ``People are starving and they need food, but people who have
food are frightened of giving it to them because they would be
accused as collaborators,'' said an American woman who believes her
husband is still hiding somewhere in Kuwait.
   ``We prayed every night that we would wake up in the morning,''
she said.
   The 136 passengers who arrived at London's Gatwick airport early
today had been in Kuwait since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion. They
included 75 Americans, mainly of Arab descent or married to Arabs.
   A number of women carried babies and were draped in gray
blankets over lightweight clothes. Most passengers would not talk
to reporters because they feared for relatives left behind.
   ``The time has come to give these people (the Kuwaitis) their
right to freedom. All we have heard of is the peaceful solution. We
are tired of that,'' said the American woman.
   Salameh Salen, 31, a Jordanian-born American, said the Kuwaiti
resistance to Iraqi forces had been ``fairly strong,'' but is now
dwindling.
   A Palestinian doctor, who said he had six children living in
Maryland and had been working in Kuwait, described the Iraqi troops
as ``tough'' and said the resistance appeared to be ``almost
collapsing.''
   After the invasion, he said he had been able to go out to wait
in line for food. At home he passed the time listening to the
radio, following developments via the BBC news.
   Gatwick officials said the passengers included 12 Canadians, 12
Britons, 10 New Zealanders, eight Germans, seven Irish, six
Australians, two Danes, two South Africans, one Polish woman and a
French citizen.
   ``We all went through situations where we didn't know if we
would get out, particularly in the early days of the invasion and
the disorder and looting,'' said New Zealander Alastair Lane.
   He said many reports of Iraqi abuses in Kuwait were true, but
some were exaggerated.
   ``Iraqi troops 90 percent of the time are pretty good,'' Lane
said.
   ``The British and the U.S. can't go outside. They've been inside
for three and a half months. Some are probably at the end of their
tether. They can't keep their lights on at night. They can't even
go out of their front door,'' Lane said.
   Lane von Wessel, a Dutch-born New Zealander, said: ``The Brits
(Britons) are the worst off because (Prime Minister Margaret)
Thatcher talks too much on TV. When she talks about the butcher of
Baghdad, that annoys those people.''
   Von Wessel said it was possible to buy food ``if you have
money.''
   Douglas Moore, a British soccer coach who worked in Kuwait for
the past four years, said he spent more than two months in hiding
with very little food.
   ``I switched addresses five times to avoid the Iraqis, who were
searching everywhere,'' Moore said.

<DATELINE>DARMSTADT, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Air Force is setting up four
contingency hospitals in Europe in preparation for a possible
influx of casualties from the Persian Gulf, the newspaper Stars and
Stripes reported today.
   The unofficial U.S. military publication said ``teams from Air
Force bases in Europe began getting the so-called `turnkey'
hospitals ready late last month.''
   ``There's no beating around the bush about it,'' the newspaper
quoted Col. Thomas M. Chester as saying. Chester is chief of
medical readiness for the Air Force in Europe.
   The newspaper said the contingency hospitals include a renovated
aircraft hangar and a former German hospital. It gave their
locations as three Royal Air Force bases in England - RAF Bicester,
RAF Little Rissington and RAF Nocton Hall - and ``one location in
Zweibruecken, Germany.''
   According to the report, some 4,500 medical personnel will be
needed if the hospitals are pressed into service.
   The newspaper said that since many Europe-based medical
personnel have been sent to the Middle East, the hospitals will be
staffed by people sent from the United States, including active
duty personnel, Air Force reservists and Air National Guard
personnel.
   ``We plan on bringing them when we're directed by the European
Command. Of course, as a medical planner, I'd like to see them here
now,'' the newspaper quoted Chester as saying.
   All four of the ``adequate but austere'' hospitals can handle
surgery and a variety of other specialized medical care, including
chemical and biological warfare injuries, the newspaper quoted
Chester as saying.
   Chester would not provide the total number of beds available at
the four hospitals, citing security reasons, the newspaper said.
   It said the U.S. Army would not comment on its contingency
medical plans.
   Stars and Stripes, which describes itself as an unofficial but
authorized daily newspaper for the military overseas, is based just
outside Darmstadt, about 12 miles south of Frankfurt.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet soldier took an armored vehicle on a joy
ride in Berlin, roaring down the posh Kurfuerstendamm boulevard and
on to Potsdam before he was stopped, police said today.
   Police chasing the tracked vehicle said the soldier damaged
several cars and refused to halt late Sunday when they tried to
flag him down. He also roared around roadblocks, police said. The
joy ride lasted several hours.
   At one point, the soldier even sped the tank-like vehicle down
Kurfuerstendamm, which bisects Berlin's shopping district, police
said.
   The soldier eventually ended up in Potsdam, just southwest of
Berlin, where a Soviet sergeant who had joined police in the chase
managed to halt the armored personnel carrier.
   Potsdam police said the sergeant jumped onto the front of the
vehicle and slammed shut the vision slit, forcing the soldier to
halt.
   Other Soviet soldiers had also been dispatched with heavy
vehicles to try to end the wild drive, police said.
   Police said the incident was under investigation and that the
soldier was still being questioned. The soldier was not immediately
identified.
   About 360,000 Soviet troops remain in eastern Germany where they
were based under Moscow's alliance with the now-defunct East
Germany. According to the agreement under which Moscow approved the
unification of East and West Germany, the Soviet troops are to be
withdrawn over the next four years.

<HEAD>World's Oldest Pout Turns to Smile at Sight of Birthday Cake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALATKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carrie White, listed in the Guinness Book
of World Records as the oldest living person, thoroughly enjoyed
her six-tiered cake and even received a call from Ronald Reagan on
her 116th birthday.
   But Mrs. White, who was born when Ulysses S. Grant was president
and Custer's last stand was two years away, didn't seem to notice
the greetings sent by Governor-elect Lawton Chiles, or the
tape-delayed phone call from Reagan.
   Reportedly, she had something else on her mind.
   Mrs. White had been unhappy all day Sunday, according to a
nurse's aide, because she had to wait until the party for a piece
of the cake. But once the cake was cut, she livened up.
   ``She's wide awake now,'' said Paul Allen, owner and
administrator of Putnam Memorial Nursing Home.
   While hundreds of well-wishers gathered around Mrs. White, she
continued eating her cake. The cake was covered in pink roses,
matching Mrs. White's pink dress and pink corsage.
   Reagan called about an hour before festivities began on the lawn
of the nursing home. The call was taped and played later for Mrs.
White and her guests.
   ``I just want you to know there will be a prayer for you in my
heart while I'm in church,'' said Reagan, who called from Beverly
Hills, Calif., before attending church.
   Mrs. White was born in Gadsden County, Fla., on Nov. 18, 1874.
She has been listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the
world's oldest living person since last year.
   Most of Mrs. White's life is a sad tale. She spent 75 years
behind the walls of Florida State Hospital at Chattahoochee, having
been committed there in 1909. Hospital records then described Mrs.
White's problem as ``post-typhoid psychosis,'' but doctors today
don't recognize the term.
   In 1984, at the age of 110, she was finally released as part of
a program to move geriatric mental patients from state
institutions.
   Several hundred people from this North Florida town attended
Sunday's party, held under a huge circus-style tent.

<TEXT>
   American University hasn't recovered yet from
the uproar over former President Richard Berendzen's guilty plea to
making obscene phone calls. NOw there's a new dispute over news he
is being offered $1 million to sever his university ties.
   A firestorm of protests erupted this month when reports surfaced
that the university Board of Trustees had agreed to make the offer.
Some students and faculty vowed to get the offer rescinded.
   Provost Milton Greenberg and Edward R. Carr, chairman of the
Board of Trustees, met with student leaders Friday and planned to
meet with key faculty members today.
   Berendzen, 51, who has continued to draw his annual salary of
about $140,000 since resigning as president in April, has not been
available for comment.
   ``I have been notified by many members of the AU community that
the information reported concerning Dr. Berendzen's settlement
package has resulted in campus-wide frustration,'' Carr said in a
open letter last week.
   Carr's letter acknowledged that many believe the decision to
offer the settlement ``did not adequately take into consideration
the input of campus constituencies, and, further, concern is also
motivated over the magnitude of Dr. Berendzen's reported settlement
package.''
   Berendzen resigned last spring as Fairfax County, Va., police
conducted an investigation of complaints that he made a series of
obscene telephone calls to Susan Allen, who ran a day care service.
   Berendzen checked himself into a sexual disorders clinic at
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
   In May, he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges and Fairfax
County General District Court Judge J. Conrad Waters Jr. sentenced
him to 30 days in jail on each charge. Waters suspended all of the
jail time, provided Berendzen stays out of trouble for one year and
continues treatment.
   Valerie B. Morris, head of the University Senate, said Friday
there is a question of whether Berendzen still retains his tenured
physics professorship.
   ``If he did, then there's a procedure to follow,'' she said. If
he sought to negotiate a severance, Morris said, ``I can guarantee
you that the amount at the end of (the procedure) wouldn't be
approximating the $680,000 we've heard is the amount the board
negotiated.'' Other reports said the board had offered $1 million.
   Under most circumstances, Morris said a tenured professor who
voluntarily leaves gets nothing - ``You resign and go.'' She said
that in a few cases the university will buy out a contract, usually
paying a year's salary.
   A letter to BErendzen spearheaded by Professor Sanford Ungar and
signed by 84 faculty members said, ``The university withstood a
great trauma last April. The reports of your proposed
million-dollar settlement have caused the anguish of last spring to
return to our community.''
   While the faculty supported BErendzen's efforts to settle his
contract with the university, the letter said, ``We do, however,
question your request for a `settlement' beyond the contracted
severance.''
   The letter urged Berendzen to ``contact the appropriate
committee'' if he believes he has tenure and wants to keep teaching
physics or ``sever any remaining employment relationship with the
university without insisting on further compensation ....''
   A key argument among students is that American University
depends so heavily on student tuition - about 89 percent of the
budget - that students should be guaranteed a voice.
   The Graduate Student Council, in a letter to Carr, noted the
university has trouble paying for things such as student financial
aid, library improvements and faculty and staff salary increases.
   The university's small endowment ``makes it even more
Astonishing that the Board of Trustees would consider stripping our
institution of such an amount of money to remunerate a single
individual,'' said the letter.
   However, Samer Farha, a senior from Beirut, is convinced that
most students want Berendzen to return to campus as a professor.
   ``I would love to take a class with him,'' Farha added. ``I
think he's done an amazing job for the university, bringing it from
where it was to where it is now.''
   Adam Hartzell, a High Point, N.C., junior who is vice president
of the Student Confederation, said Berendzen should not return.
   ``I think it would just further divide the community and that's
not what I want right now,'' he said. ``I'd rather have an AU that
comes together again.''

<HEAD>Outcast Crimean Tatars Given Some Land After Sit-in</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ukrainian authorities relinquished land to Crimean
Tatars after they occupied a government building on the west coast
of the Crimean peninsula, a newspaper reported today.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda used the incident last week
to illustrate that no resettlement program exists for the Crimean
Tatars, who were expelled from the Black Sea peninsula by Stalin
and now are returning to their traditional lands.
   Pravda said 46 Crimean Tatars took part in the sit-in at
Yevpatoriya City Hall. They demanded that the nearby area of
Ismail-Bey, already home to Tatar squatters, be given to them,
Pravda said.
   Police later sealed off the building - a move the Tatars
interpreted as a prelude to violence - and 100 more Tatars gathered
with gasoline bombs Nov. 11, the newspaper reported.
   The situation was defused when representatives of the Ukrainian
government and the Soviet parliament intervened, and it was decided
to give the Tatars the 163 acres of land they were demanding, the
newspaper said.
   Pravda did not say when the protest began or when it ended.
   The Tatars of the Crimea were resettled in Siberia and Central
Asia during World War II, when Josef Stalin expelled several
peoples from their homelands on the grounds they could not be
trusted to occupy strategic areas.
   The Tatars, among other ethnic groups, long have been agitating
to return. In 1989, the Supreme Soviet legislature declared that
all peoples exiled under Stalin should be considered politically
rehabilitated.
   However, other people now occupy the lands and houses of the
exiles.
   Several thousand Tatars have returned to the Crimea in recent
years. Last month, authorities began preventing more Tatars from
settling in the area after clashes between Tatars and other
residents.
   Tent camps in the Crimea house more than 2,500 Tatars, the
independent Interfax news agency reported.
   ``After Crimean Tatars were allowed to return to the peninsula,
no one took the trouble to set up a resettlement mechanism,''
Pravda said. ``It is still unclear how many people want to change
their places of residence, and the areas where the outcasts will
settle ... have not been determined.''
   ``This is why chaos reigns in the Crimea,'' it continued.
``Groups of Tatars arbitrarily seize farmland areas and partition
cultivated fields, provoking discontent among those who use this
land.''
   Ethnographers estimate there are 500,000 Crimean Tatars in the
Soviet Union, and another 1 million in Turkey. The Crimean Tatars'
protests near the Kremlin in 1987 demanding to be allowed to return
home were among the first tests of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
promises of greater democracy.

<HEAD>40 Killed in Clashes Around South Africa</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police said today that at
least 40 people were killed in clashes around South Africa,
including 19 men who were shot and stabbed to death in a black
township.
   Police said the bodies of the men were discovered today in
Zonkwezizwe township outside Johannesburg.
   Some residents said Zonkwezizwe had been hit by fighting between
Xhosas and rival Zulus of the conservative Inkatha movement, but
others said the clashes involved criminal gangs. Dozens of people
have been killed in the township in recent weeks, residents said.
   Police said they did not know why the men were killed and there
had been no reports of factional fighting in the township. Police
patrols had not detected any trouble Sunday night, when the men
were killed, officials said.
   The bodies, found scattered around the township, had stab and
bullet wounds.
   Fighting pitting Zulu supporters of Inkatha against Xhosas and
other blacks linked to the African National Congress has killed
more than 800 people in Johannesburg area townships since August.
   Both movements want to end apartheid but they disagree on South
Africa's future.
   In other violence, two white police officers and a black man
were killed early today in Port Elizabeth on the east coast, police
said. The three apparently were ambushed in a black township, and
their vehicle was riddled by automatic weapons fire, they said.
   Police did not say who the black man was or why he was with the
two officers. The unidentified attackers escaped.
   Police said 18 other people were killed in various incidents in
other parts of the country since Saturday but gave few details.
   The dead included two people killed in a clash in Johannesburg
Saturday when police opened fire on a prohibited march by black
activists.
   African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela urged supporters
Sunday to step up a campaign of strikes, protests and other mass
action to force an end to apartheid.
   ``We are a forgiving people but we are not slaves,'' Mandela
told 15,000 cheering, singing people at a stadium south of
Johannesburg.
   ``Boycotts, stayaways, strikes civil disobedieance, marches and
meetings are all legitimate peaceful means of struggle,'' he said.
   President F.W. de Klerk's government has pledged to end
apartheid and negotiate a new constitution that would give the
black majority a share of political power.
   Mandela on Sunday accused the government of calling for reform
while trying to preserve political and economic power for the white
minority.

<HEAD>Women Thwart Rape Attempt at Clothing Store; `They Really Let Him

<DATELINE>FALLON, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two clothing store employees foiled a
would-be rapist by biting him, grabbing his gun away and beating
him on the head with a pipe, authorities said.
   Michael Ralph Vader, 35, of Fallon was booked for investigation
of kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault, and he required
medical treatment, polic said. He was arrested about four hours
after the Saturday evening incident.
   ``They really let him have it,'' said Assistant Police Chief
Louis Fetherolf. ``The woman who bit his hand really took a chunk
out. And the woman who hit him with the pipe nailed him in the head
a number of times. There was a lot of blood.''
   Fetherolf said a man entered the Lady Faire store Saturday
evening and ordered the two female employees into the back at
gunpoint.
   He ordered one of the women to stay in a back room and the other
to disrobe. But as the man began to take his clothes off, the
disrobed woman decided to resist.
   Fetherolf said she severely bit his hand and grabbed the
small-caliber pistol. The gun fired in a subsequent scuffle, but no
one was hit. The woman then gained control of the gun and tried to
shoot the suspect, but it wouldn't go off.
   The other woman came to her aid and ``split the suspect's head
open'' by repeatedly beating him in the head with a heavy pipe,
Fetherolf said.
   The man put his clothes back on and rushed out the store,
leaving a trail of blood. Vader was arrested without incident at a
trailer park south of Fallon later in the evening.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has called for
keeping all the land from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River
``for future generations and for the mass immigration'' of Soviet
Jews.
   The statement Sunday to members of his right-wing Likud bloc
drew immediate criticism in Israel and abroad.
   Egypt accused Shamir of ``expansionist intentions,'' and the
opposition Labor Party said fresh controversy over Shamir's remark
could interfere with a wave of Soviet immigration.
   Shamir's comment was similar to a statement in January that set
off an international protest.
   At that time, he told a party gathering that ``for a large
immigration, we need the land of Israel, a large and strong Israel.
We will need a lot of place to absorb everybody.''
   Palestinian and Arab leaders immediately launched a campaign to
block immigration of thousands of Soviet Jews. The Arabs fear the
immigrants will displace Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Israel captured the territories in the 1967 Middle EAst war from
Jordan and Egypt. Palestinians have been waging a nearly three-year
uprising aimed at freeing the land from Israeli control.
   The United States has repeatedly called for a land-for-peace
settlement in the region and has insisted on Israeli guarantees
that U.S.-backed loans for the Soviet immigrants not be used in the
occupied lands or Arab east Jerusalem.
   Shamir was quoted by Israel radio as telling a Sunday memorial
service for deceased Likud politicians: ``The party leaders left us
a clear message to keep the land of Israel from the sea to the
Jordan (River) for future generations and for the mass immigration
and for the Jewish people, most of whom will be gathered into this
country.''
   After the speech, Shamir denied he was returning to his earlier
theme of ``a greater Israel'' - which would include the occupied
territories - to accommodate the thousands of arriving Soviet Jews,
Israeli newspapers said. At least 120,000 Soviet Jews have arrived
so far this year, and a million are expected by the end of 1992.
   ``There is no connection whatever between our maintaining the
territorial integrity of Eretz Israel (the land of Israel) between
the sea and the Jordan River - which is a vital security necessity
for the state of Israel - and the mass immigration, which is the
fulfillment of the great Zionist dream,'' the Jerusalem Post quoted
him as saying.
   In Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismat Abdel-Meguid ordered
Israel's ambassador to explain Shamir's remark. His ministry issued
a statement saying:
   ``Egypt rejects in its totality ... Shamir's comments which
indicate his expansionist intention to occupy territories belonging
to someone else and this cannot help reach a peaceful settlement to
the Palestinian issue.''
   Chaim Ramon, head of the Labor Party faction in Parliament,
criticized Shamir's comment on Israel radio: ``I am calling on the
prime minister to be quiet, for heaven's sake. He is risking the
chances of immigration,'' Ramon said. He was apparently referring
to the controversy that erupted over Shamir's earlier comments.
   In the past, Shamir has sometimes made strong statements
followed quickly by a ``clarification.''
   In August, the prime minister hinted in a speech to American
Jewish contributors that Israel would consider a pre-emptive strike
on Iraq.
   ``In the circumstances our major task is to prevent war, or to
pre-empt it and if, heaven forbid, these two fail, and there is no
alternative, we have to win quickly and decisively,'' he said in
his speech.
   Questioned later by reporters, Shamir denied Israel was
considering a pre-emptive strike.

   Raymond Robert Clark was executed in
Florida's electric chair today for the 1977 slaying of a
businessman who was forced to write a $5,000 check at gunpoint,
then shot to death.
   Clark, 49, died at 7:07 a.m. EST as a handful of death-penalty
protesters and several proponents gathered outside the fog-shrouded
Florida State Prison. He did not make a final statement.
   Among the two dozen witnesses was Gregory Drake, 38, the
victim's son. The governor's office had requested that the younger
Drake be allowed to witness the execution, said Bob Macmaster, a
Department of Corrections spokesman.
   Clark's appeals were exhausted when the U.S. Supreme Court voted
8-1 Sunday to reject two emergency requests for a delay. The lone
dissenter was Justice Thurgood Marshall, who opposes the death
penalty in all circumstances.
   The appeals were based on changes in the capital punishment law
since Clark's sentencing.
   ``It's just tragic,'' said defense attorney Billy Nolas before
going to the prison for a final visit with his client.
   Clark was the fourth Florida inmate to be put to death this year
and the 25th to die since the state resumed executions in 1979. In
all, 142 people have been killed nationwide since the U.S. Supreme
Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976; Florida has had more
executions than any state except Texas.
   Clark was convicted and sentenced to death for the April 27,
1977, murder of David Drake, a Pinellas County scrapyard owner.
   Clark and his male lover abducted Drake from the parking lot of
a St. Petersburg bank, drove him to a secluded area and ordered him
to write a $5,000 check payable to cash. Clark then shot the
businessman twice in the head.
   When they were unable to cash the check, Clark and an accomplice
called Drake's son and demanded $10,000 for the safe return of the
victim he had already killed.
   Police traced later phone calls and arrested Ty Johnston,
Clark's 16-year-old lover. Johnston pleaded guilty to murder and
testified against Clark. He was paroled in 1987 after nine years of
a 25-year sentence.
   ``I want him executed. He's ruined my life. He's ruined my son's
life,'' Drake's widow, Donna, said of Clark last week. ``My husband
didn't do anything to deserve to die.''
   At the time of Drake's murder, Clark was on parole from
California for the killing of a 14-year-old boy, also reported to
be a homosexual lover of his.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Sun Li-jen, a Nationalist Chinese war
hero who was accused of trying to topple President Chiang Kai-shek,
died today of pneumonia and sepsis, hospital officials said. He was
91.
   Sun died at his residence in Taichung in central Taiwan, the
officials said. He had been discharged earlier today from the
Veterans General Hospital at his family's request, the hospital
said. He had been hospitalized since last month.
   Sun was dubbed ``the ever-victorious general'' for his feats
during World War II. In one battle in Burma, he led an outnumbered
contingent that successfully rescued about 7,000 British and
Burmese soldiers held by about 10,000 Japanese soldiers.
   He was later made a Commander of the British Empire by the
British government.
   In 1955, six years after the Nationalists lost a civil war to
Communist forces and retreated to Taiwan, Sun and other officers
were accused of plotting to overthrow Chiang. Some details of the
episode still remain unclear.
   Sun, who was Chiang's chief of staff between 1954 and 1955,
denied the charge but was placed under house arrest.
   He was finally freed in 1988, a year after Chiang's death, when
the Control Yuan, the government's watchdog assembly, released a
1955 report that had cleared Sun of involvement in the coup plot.
   The Control Yuan gave no explanation for delaying release of the
report, but historians believe Chiang had regarded Sun as a
political rival.
   Sun, a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, is survived
by his wife, two sons and two daughters.
   Funeral arrangements were pendin.

<HEAD>Report: Communist Agents Plotted To Kill Opposition Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agents of Poland's former Communist
government plotted to kill dissident writer Adam Michnik during the
late 1970s, according to a report today in the newspaper he now
edits.
   Michnik was the target of ``Operation Drone,'' linked with a
wide-ranging theft and corruption plot known as the Iron Affair,
Gazeta Wyborcza said.
   The newspaper, Poland's largest, published excerpts of reports
on the operation, compiled in 1984 during an internal Interior
Ministry investigation.
   Michnik, 44, is a leading Solidarity movement theoretician and a
widely published essayist in Poland and abroad.
   An opposition activist from his university days in the 1960s, he
went to Paris in 1976 at the invitation of existentialist writer
Jean-Paul Sartre and was jailed for several months shortly after
his return in May 1977.
   One of the Interior Ministry agents linked to the alleged plot,
Mieczyslaw Janosz, was arrested in OCtober with Gen. Miroslaw
Milewski, a Communist Party Politburo member and a former Interior
Minister, and five others in connection with the Iron Affair, the
newspaper said.
   According to the report, Janosz and his brother, Jan, were being
trained in West Germany at the Interior Ministry's orders for an
assault on an unspecified target in 1977 or 1978, Gazeta Wyborcza
said.
   ``According to some information, the aim of the sham assault was
to terminate this person,'' the newspaper said. Gazeta Wyborcza
said a ranking Interior Ministry official confirmed recently that
Michnik was the ``drone,'' or the target.
   In a commentary headlined ``The Drone Speaks,'' Michnik, editor
in chief of Gazeta Wyborcza, wrote: ``I have to disappoint all my
compatriots who believed the Interior Ministry would save them from
the ominous conspiracy of `Drone' and his crew ... Your money, my
dear compatriots, was wasted.''
   The report in Gazeta Wyborcza said the target was observed for
two days in Paris but was always accompanied by at least two
people. The report also said Michnik did not appear at the
addresses under surveillance in West Germany.
   According to the newspaper, Mieczyslaw Janosz, a lawyer, was
arrested with another brother, Kazimierz, a ranking intelligence
officer, in connection with the Iron Affair. Jan Janosz was killed
in a car accident in Poland several years ago, the newspaper said.
   Prosecutors in the Iron Affair allege Polish intelligence
officers, from 1968 through the 1970s, used insurance frauds and
thefts to accumulate gold and other valuables and ship them to
Poland. The 1984 investigation was quashed by the Politburo,
officials said.
   The Interior Ministry, now largely cleared of Communist
officials, has also turned up a briefly considered plot to kidnap
union leader Lech Walesa during the 1980 strikes that gave birth to
Solidarity.

<TEXT>
   Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the largest Soviet
republic, demanded today that Mikhail S. Gorbachev consult with
leaders of the republics before implementing his plan to reorganize
the national government.
   In his first public comment on the Soviet president's proposals,
Yeltsin told the independent Interfax news agency that he found
some of them ``disappointing,'' but did not specify which ones. He
said he needed to study the proposals thoroughly.
   ``My attitude toward them is not that simple,'' said Yeltsin,
president of the Russian Republic, who is Gorbachev's political
rival and frequent critic.
   In an effort to break what is being called a ``paralysis of
power'' between the central government and the Soviet Union's
splintering republics, Gorbachev on Saturday proposed dumping his
embattled prime minister, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, revamping the
executive branch and putting it entirely under his control. The
Soviet parliament gave initial approval to the proposals, which
included putting representatives of each republic on a main
governing council.
   Getting rid of Ryzhkov and his Council of Ministers, or Cabinet,
has been one of Yeltsin's demands, and some of Gorbachev's
proposals seemed to be a concession to the Russian president.
   ``The president's suggestions are all aimed at strengthening the
center,'' Yeltsin told Interfax.
   He said the Soviet leader apparently ignored suggestions from
leaders of the sovereign republics before making the proposals.
   Yeltsin criticized Gorbachev for proposing the restructuring
without consulting the republics, and said such a decision-making
process is unacceptable to Russia.
   He said the questions involved ``are not political. These are
questions of inter-ethnic relations.''
   ``Before making such a decision, the president should have
consulted with the leadership of all sovereign republics,''
Interfax quoted him as saying. ``And this never has been done. That
means that again, knowing that the republics won't approve of it,
they want to push it forward. But their reaction will be
opposite.''
   In an apparent reference to the political stalemate that exists
between the central government and the 15 republics, Yeltsin said:
``I am even convinced that all this will only make the situation in
the country worse, rather than improve it.''
   Yeltsin and even Gorbachev have referred to this government
crisis as a ``paralysis of power.'' Laws implemented by the central
government are being ignored or overridden by many Soviet
republics, which are seeking greater sovereignty and say their own
measures take precedence over those coming from the Kremlin.
   Gorbachev urged the Council of Ministers be replaced by several
bodies under direct presidential control. The principal ruling body
would be the Federation Council, created in March as a presidential
advisory body but which would now be expanded to iclude
representatives of the Soviet republics.
   Gorbachev also suggested naming a vice president, forming an
``inter-republican committee'' under the Federation Council, a
national Security Council and a presidential body to coordinate the
activities of law enforcement agencies, including sending
representatives to regions.
   Radical legislators generally gave qualified support to the
proposals, although some said Gorbachev was trying to grab too much
power and others said he did not go far enough in giving the
republics full independence. Parliament will take final action on
it Friday.
   Grigory Yavlinsky, deputy prime minister of the Russian republic
and co-author with Stanislav Shatalin of the radical ``500-day''
economic reform program, also gave a somewhat positive assessment
of Gorbachev's proposals. He said in an interview with the Tass
news agency that Gorbachev's plans and Yeltsin's suggestion of a
coalition government ``are not incompatible.''
   The Soviet press on Sunday generally praised the speech.

<HEAD>A&amp;M Panel Finds No Evidence of Fraud in Cold Fusion Research</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Allegations that Texas A&amp;M researchers spiked
water with tritium to fake cold nuclear fusion are apparently
unfounded, an internal panel said.
   The panel, in a report dated Oct. 15 and released by the
university Sunday, recommended that investigations into the charges
be dropped. It said the researchers whose work was questioned may
have acted hastily but did not do severely substandard work.
   The report was written by three Texas A&amp;M professors assigned to
investigate the research at Texas that followed the March 1989
claim by scientists in Utah that they had achieved cold fusion in a
beaker of room-temperature water.
   Such a discovery would create a cheap, clean and virtually
inexhaustible supply of energy.
   Scientists all over the world rushed to confirm the discovery by
B. Stanley Pons of the University of Utah and his British
colleague, Martin Fleischmann.
   But the journal Science suggested in its June 15, 1989, issue
that some A&amp;M experiments had been tainted.
   One such experiment, conducted by A&amp;M electrochemist John
O'Malley Bockris, involved running a series of electrolytic cells
modeled after those in Utah. Some cells sporadically produced
tritium, a standard byproduct of nuclear fusion. The experiment was
the strongest evidence anywhere for cold fusion.
   But critics questioned the results, saying the tritium was not
accompanied by other fusion byproducts, and suggested the
experiment had been spiked with tritium.
   The report issued Sunday concluded that spiking was unlikely, in
part because scientists got different results when they tested the
spiking theory by intentionally putting tritium in water.
   ``While it is not possible for us to categorically exclude
spiking as a possibility, it is our opinion that possibility is
much less probable than that of inadvertent contamination or other
unexplained factors in the measurements,'' the report said.
   The report said that in general, the furor over the alleged
discovery of cold fusion caused scientists at Texas A&amp;M to rush
their research and lose scientific objectivity, but concluded that
none of the experiments was conducted fraudulently.
   ``The earliest attempts to reproduce those experiments were done
hastily, using available material and improvised setups where
necessary,'' the report said. ``This, coupled with the perceived
pressures of racing against other groups, certainly led to some
less than perfect experimental design.''
   But the report added that even in their haste, researchers
maintained generally normal standards. It also said that with the
decreasing amount of attention, continuing research is being
conducted properly.
   The A&amp;M report noted that researchers are still trying to
confirm Pons and Fleischmann's discovery, but so far have failed,
leaving the general scientific community skeptical that the two
actually achieved cold fusion.
   The internal report was written by John Poston, a nuclear
engineer; Edward S. Fry, a physicist; and Joseph B. Natowitz, a
chemist.

   A plane ferrying American
cigarettes to Moscow crash-landed in flames northeast of Prague.
The six-member crew survived, but looters made off with some of the
cargo.
   The Tupolev 154 was carrying 15 tons of American-made cigarettes
to the Soviet capital from Switzerland on Saturday when fire broke
out on board, the Rude Pravo newpaper said.
   The three-engine Soviet plane landed in a field near Dvur
Kralove, about 75 miles northeast of Prague.
   The jet was on fire when it landed, and it took several hours
for firefighters to extinguish the blaze, another newspaper,
Obcansky Denik, reported. Some of the cargo was saturated with jet
fuel and burned, the paper said.
   ``It is incredible that all six memebers of the crew survived,
nobody was seriously hurt,'' the daily quoted Dr. Jarosalv Houf as
saying.
   On Sunday, Czechoslovak television accused residents of acting
like hyenas. It broadcast footage showing dozens of people
retrieving packages of cigarettes from the wrecked fuselage.
   ``When trying to put things right, the police heard verbal abuse
impossible to use in print,'' Rude Pravo said.
   A pack of American cigarettes is worth 50 Czechoslovak crowns,
or $2. The average monthly salary in Czechoslovakia would buy only
about 60 packs of such cigarettes.

   Nationalists were headed for a
surprise victory over communists in elections in
Bosnia-Hercegovina's first free elections since 1938, according to
partial results released today.
   The Serbian Democratic Alliance, the Croatian Democratic Union,
and the Moslem Union for Democratic Action were leading the
republic's communist party and federal Premier Ante Markovic's
Alliance of Reform Forces.
   With 15 percent of the vote counted in the central republic, the
Serbian party was ahead in three of Bosnia's seven constituencies.
The Croats and the Moslems were leading in two each.
   The 240 seats in Bosnia's bicameral parliament are divided among
the seven constituencies. Final results were not expected for
several days.
   ``The communists were rejected in Bosnia's elections because of
the disastrous consequences of their 45 years of monopoly on
power,'' said Radovan Karadzic, president of the Serbian Democratic
Alliance. ``This is a victory for democracy.''
   Zlatko Lajundzia, a member of the communist party's presidium,
said, `it is obvious that the nationalist parties are doing much
better than we and they had expected.''
   Pre-election polls had shown the communists and Markovic's
reformists well ahead. The two parties had claimed victory for a
nationalist party could lead to civil war.
   Western observers said the elections, in which about 70 percent
of the electorate cast ballots, were free and generally fair.
   ``Except for some isolated incidences, in general the elections
seem to have been carried out fairly,'' said David Evans, a senior
adviser for a U.S. congressional commission monitoring human rights
and security in Europe.
   Bosnia-Hercegovina, whose 4.2 million people include Serbs,
Croats and Moslems, is geographically and politically at the heart
of Yugoslavia's bitter rivalries.
   Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital, is best known for the assassination
of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a young nationalist
in 1914. That killing sparked World War I.
   Serbia and Croatia are the two largest Yugoslav republics, and
they flank Bosnia-Hercegovina. They have previously made
territorial claims on Bosnia.
   Serbia, still under communist rule before elections Dec. 9,
wants to keep power centralized in Belgrade, the Serbian and
federal capital. Croatia, where the Croatian Democratic Union
defeated the communists in spring elections, wants Yugoslavia to
become a confederation of nearly independent states.
   Bosnia has so far steered a neutral and independent course.
   Hostility has existed among the Moslems, the mainly Roman
Catholic Croats and the Orthodox Serbs since Yugoslavia was founded
as a kingdom in 1918. During the Nazi occupation of World War II,
Bosnia was the scene of a civil war among Croats, Serbs, communists
and the Germans.

beforehand. ``This reduces to practically nil the tensions that
have existed.''
   The leaders also signed a companion non-aggression declaration
between the 16 nations of NATO and the 6 nations of the Warsaw
Pact, which is disintegrating as a Soviet-led mililtary alliance.
   It pledged that the nations ``are no longer adversaries, will
build new partnerships and extend to each other the hand of
friendship.'' The document also asserted that the countries have an
``obligation and commitment to refrain from the threat or use of
force'' against each other.
   It was clear from the outset that the Persian Gulf crisis was on
the minds of many leaders.
   In his speech, Bush saluted those who have made it possible for
Europe to end ``decades of repression to rediscover their
birthright of freedom.''
   In hailing the convention arms treaty, he also looked ahead to
an ``open skies'' agreement permitting reconnaissance flights to
check compliance with arms agreements.
   Then he took an abrupt rhetorical turn to the Persian Gulf,
where he said the principles of democracy and freedom that guide
the new Europe ``have been violated.'' Recalling that he and
Gorbachev issued a joint call last fall for an Iraqi withdrawal,
Bush said, ``Can there be room for any other view?...(These)
principles have no geographic limits.''
   Gorbachev looked ahead to negotiations still to come. He said
the Soviet Union is willing to begin negotiations on reducing
arsenals of short range nuclear weapons within a month or two.
   ``Instead of military force our world order will be based on
equitable dialogue,'' he said.

   Gorbachev, who permitted democracy to come to the former Soviet
satellite states of Eastern Europe, was the last leader to sign the
accords.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, the host, had been the
first, and when the documents were passed back to him, the leaders
applauded their work. ``We are putting an end to the previous
age,'' he said.
   With the extraordinary assembly of government leaders, French
authorities mobilized rooftop sharpshooters, anti-terrorist units
and 10,000 police officers to provide security - and also to clear
paths for convoys of limousines. Parisians braced for severe
traffic disruptions.
   The leaders of the NATO members, six Warsaw Pact countries and
12 neutral nations proceeded from Versailles to the Kleber
International Conference Center to officially open the three-day
summit on European security.
   ``Our meeting today marks the end of an an epoch and thereby a
beginning,'' said Mitterrand in the opening speech. ``It is the
first time in history that we witness a change in depth of our
landscape which is not the outcome of a war or bloody revolution
... .''
   Even as the leaders met to discuss peace in Europe, their
attention was diverted to the Persian Gulf, where an international
force of hundreds of thousands of troops is stationed to counter
Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   Officials said Bush would seek backing for a United Nations
resolution authorizing military action to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   In another round of diplomacy, Bush planned to meet over dinner
with Gorbachev, their fourth meeting in less than a year. The
Persian Gulf was one likely topic of discussion. Another was U.S.
assistance to the embattled Soviet leader, struggling against
economic difficulties.
   ``We would always be open-minded on humanitarian aid if there's
a real need there,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Bay Area Papers Reach Agreement With Unions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marathon negotiations produced a tentative
agreement that averted a strike at the Bay Area's three largest
newspapers.
   The 45-month pact calls for a 3.5 percent to 4 percent annual
wage increase for the unions representing some 4,500 employees at
the San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco Chronicle and the San
Jose Mercury News.
   Union leaders indicated the votes on the proposed contract would
be taken sometime after Thanksgiving.
   Employees had been without a contract since February. A strike
deadline of 5 p.m. Friday had been set, but talks were continued
through the night. After 48 continuous hours of negotiations, union
officials announced the tentative pact about 10 a.m. Saturday.
   ``No strike! We have a good contract!'' union leader Carl Hall
shouted as he climbed atop a table at union strike headquarters to
make the announcement.
   Chief management negotiator Richard Jordan praised ``good-faith
bargaining'' as a key to successful talks.
   ``I am pleased that a settlement was reached that continues
successful labor relations between these major newspapers and the
employees of unions that represent them,'' he said.
   The tentative settlement would provide $89 per week more over
the course of the contract, which expires in November 1993, for
craft unions such as printers and engravers, and $95 for reporters,
editors and drivers.
   Current top scale is $801 a week for reporters and editors, $669
for clerical and library workers and $675 for drivers. The unions
had sought a 20 percent wage hike.
   The three papers have a combined circulation of about 1 million.
   Doug Cuthbertson, chairman of the Conference of Newspaper
Unions, said, ``At this time of terrible economic difficulties for
news and other businesses across the country, I think the employers
have given us every last cent they could afford to.''

   President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev led European
leaders today in signing a historic treaty that slashes non-nuclear
weapons in Europe and pushes the Cold War deeper into history.
``What a long way the world has come,'' exulted the Soviet leader.
   Scarcely had the accord been signed when Bush sought to cement
European support for the continued effort to force Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait. ``Our success here can be neither profound
nor enduring if the rule of law is shamelessly disregarded
elsewhere,'' he said in a speech to a 34-nation summit called to
discuss European security in the post Cold War era.
   Gorbachev followed Bush to the podium, and he, too, blended
words of praise for East-West cooperation in Europe with the need
to halt Iraq's aggression.
   ``We're prepared to show patience in the quest for a political
solution but we remain firm and determined in implementing the will
of the United Nations,'' which has demanded Iraq's withdrawal, he
said.
   The two men spoke after a glittering signing ceremony in an
ornate ballroom at the Elysee Palace. The long-sought agreement to
destroy tens of thousands of tanks, artillery and armored combat
vehicles in Europe is the most sweeping arms accord in history. It
will alter the military balance in Europe by erasing Moscow's
ability to mass huge numbers of tanks and other heavy armor in
central Europe.

   An appeals court today gave ordinary criminal
courts jurisdiction to try a former French official accused of
sending 194 Jewish children to their deaths in concentration camps
during World War II.
   The Paris Court of Appeals overturned a lower court ruling last
month Rene Bousquet could only be tried by the High Court of the
Liberation, formed in 1944 to prosecute officials of the
collaborationist Vichy government. The court has been defunct for
decades.
   Court of Appeals President Albert Moatty ruled today that the
length of time required to reconstitute the court could preclude
justice in the case of Bousquet, who is 81.
   With Moatty's ruling, state prosecutors can resume their
investigation of evidence on Bousquet's case that was provided by
Nazi hunters.
   Bousquet headed the national police during the Nazi occupation
of France. State prosecutors in September asked that he be
investigated in connection with the deportation of 194 Jewish
children during the war.
   Should the case go to trial, Bousquet would be the
highest-ranking official of the Vichy government to be tried for
crimes against humanity.
   But Serge Klarsfeld, a lawyer and prominent Nazi hunter, has
said senior government officials, including President Francois
Mitterrand, appear reluctant to pursue the case.
   Bousquet was condemned in 1949 for his wartime activities, but
the decision was reversed due to ``acts accomplished in favor of
the Resistance'' - namely his decision to free some jailed
Resistance fighters at the time he was ousted from his post.
   Human rights leaders say none of the high-ranking French
political figures with direct roles in deporting and arresting
100,000 Jews during the war has been brought to justice.
   Yves Jouffa, president of the French League of Human Rights, has
said the recent trial of the Gestapo chief of Lyon, Klaus Barbie,
``was the trial of Nazi Germany, not collaborationist France.''
   A federation of human rights groups has organized a commisison
of inquiry to determine why action against Bousquet and two other
suspected war criminals, Paul Touvier and Maurice Papon, has taken
so long.
   Touvier, 75, is being prosecuted for his activities as a
pro-Nazi militia chief who worked with Barbie in Lyon. He was
captured last year after spending years in hiding under the shelter
of right-wing Roman Catholic monks.
   Charges against Papon, a former budget minister, have been
pending for seven years. He has been accused of responsibility for
the arrests and deportations of 1,700 Jews while an administrator
in Bordeaux during the war.

<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry today ordered an
inquiry into a secret agreement between the military and the CIA
that set up a guerrilla network in case of a Soviet invasion.
   Current and former government officials have said the agreement
was made in 1955.
   Members of the Greece's conservative government and of the
former socialist administration have said the network essentially
went out of business in 1974 and was dismantled by 1988.
   Reports from other countries indicate the secret network
extended to most NATO members during the Cold War. It has become
known commonly as Operation Gladio, the name of its Italian
version.
   Leftist parties in Greece have denounced the secret agreement,
and they demand to know whether the network was ever used for
clandestine activities in times of peace.
   The Defense Ministry said an investigation ``was deemed
necessary because of the commotion which was created and is
continuing, and the different views being expressed concerning the
aims of the agreement and the way in which it was implemented,''
the semi-official Athens NEws Agency reported.
   Radio stations reported that the inquiry will be led by a
retired military officer.
   Current and former U.S. officials have said the CIA helped
organize guerrilla units in Western Europe in preparation for a
possible Soviet invasion but had nothing to do with them after the
1950s.
   The Italian Parliament is investigating the network in that
country, and according to testimony the Italian participants
trained at a U.S. base in 1972.

   There was no sign of survivors.
   The Spanish-made Casa airplane, which had been missing since
late Sunday, was discovered wrecked on a Pacific coast mountainside

   He said in a statement that bad weather caused the crash.
   Most of those aboard the plane were civilians, Diaz said, and

   Iraq will send an additional 250,000
troops to Kuwait, more than doubling its military strength in the
occupied emirate, the Iraqi News Agency reported today.
   Seven extra divisions of the regular army would be sent
immediately, INA said, and another 150,000 reserves would be called
to duty. The Iraqi agency report was monitored in Cyprus.
   The move, announced after a meeting headed by President Saddam
Hussein, came 11 days after President Bush announced a U.S. buildup
in the Persian Gulf that would bring American troop strength in the
region to about 430,000 soldiers, Marines, and other personnel.
   Previously, Iraq was believed to have an estimated 10 divisions,
totaling 170,000 troops in Kuwait and about 250,000 men in southern
Iraq.
   Overall, Iraq has an estimated 555,000 regular troops and
480,000 reserves. It claims a militia called the Popular Army has 5
million men.
   On Sunday, Saddam said he would free the estimated 2,000
remaining Westerners stranded in Iraq and occupied Kuwait between
Christmas and March 25 ``unless something would take place that
Mars the atmosphere of peace.''
   Bush today dismissed that announcement as a bid to buy time.
   Saddam has been freeing the hostages a few at a time since his
troops overran Kuwait.

<BYLINE>Guerrillas Launch Simultaneous Attacks In Three Provinces

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a rare show of unity, rival
guerrilla commanders launched an offensive against Afghanistan's
Soviet-backed government today in three provinces surrounding the
capital, rebel spokesmen said.
   A barrage of rockets slammed into an ammunition dump several
miles north of the Afghan capital, Kabul, just before dawn,
signaling the start of a blitz on dozens of government targets,
they said.
   ``It was one of the government's largest ammunition dumps,''
said Minhaj, a spokesman for a joint rebel news organization known
as MIDIA.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties and no way to
independently confirm the claims. The rebel sources spoke from
Pakistan, where the guerrilla groups have their headquarters.
   One Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonoymity, said
in Islamabad that ``something was happening'' but that he and
others were scrambling for details.
   Farid, a member of the Hezb-e-Islami, the most radical and
anti-West of the seven major guerrilla groups, said the offensive
on Kabul, Logar and Wardak provinces took several weeks to plan.
   ``The main purpose of the operation is to eventually take
Kabul,'' said Farid, who like most Afghans uses only one name.
   Minhaj said sporadic and often confused reports from the
battlefront indicated guerrilla fighters were launching rockets at
dozens of government targets in an arc around Kabul.
   The guerrillas, financed by the United States, Saudi Arabia and
other sympathetic Arab states, have been fighting for more than 12
years to overthrow successive communist-style governments in
Afghanistan.
   Most of the countryside is under the guerrillas' control, and
troops loyal to President Najibullah hold the major cities.
   The guerrillas have failed to score a major military victory
since February 1989 when the last of 115,000 Soviet soldiers ended
nine years of direct intervention and withdrew from Afghanistan.
   Instead, the guerrilla leaders once touted as an alternative to
Najibullah have become bitterly divided. Najibullah has taken
advanatge of their feuding to score some political and military
victories in the past year.
   Guerrilla leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who has been criticized by
other rebel leaders as brutal and ambitious, claims to be leading
the latest offensive.
   ``All the groups have joined hands and all the field commanders
are involved in this offensive,'' said Farid, a spokesman for
Hekmatyar. ``They've all agreed that Hekmatyar will lead.''
   However, no other guerrilla group conceded Hekmatyar's
leadership.

   Six miners were killed and six
were missing after earthquakes set off rock slides at two gold
mines, officials said today.
   Early today, a temblor registering 1.7 on the Richter scale
caused a rock slide at Anglo American Corp.'s Western Deep Levels
Mine west of JOhannesburg, the company said.
   Anglo American spokesman J.A. Du Plessis said three miners were
killed and six were missing. The men were working about 3,850 yards
below ground, and rescue workers were trying to reach the missing
Men, the spokesman said.
   Three workers died at the Buffelsfontein mine near Klerksdorp,
about 110 miles southwest of Johannesburg, after a quake
registering 3.2 on the Richter scale caused a rock slide.
   The incident occurred Saturday, but the mine operator, Genmin,
did not report it until today.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today urged a
new world order in which his country would abandon totalitarianism
for democracy and discard separatist passions and nationalism.
   In sketching his grand vision for Europe and the world at the
34-nation Paris summit, the Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe, Gorbachev made a rare reference to ``totalitarianism''
in the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev deemed the 1975 Helsinki Final Act on which the CSCE
process was built a human rights document ``ahead of its time.''
The CSCE, he said, enabled international relations to change in the
last five years.
   In the Soviet Union, this meant ``a shift away from
totalitarianism to a democratic system, away from the command
economy ... to a state underpinned by the rule of law ... away from
unitarianism to a union of sovereign states,'' he said.
   ``Our country has changed and will never be the same as it was
before,'' he added. ``We have opened up to the world and the world
has opened up in response.''
   Alluding only briefly to his present difficulties at home,
Gorbachev predicted with characteristic confidence that they would
not affect his country's role on the world stage.
   ``No matter what difficulties the Soviet Union faces today, it
will remain a great European power, in line with its enormous
potential,'' Gorbachev said.
   He proceeded to outline Soviet visions for the future of Europe.
   Saying that the crumbling Warsaw Pact alliance intends to take
important decisions at a summit planned for December, Gorbachev
reiterated the Kremlin's desire to see naval weapons and tactical
nuclear arms reduced by future European negotiations.
   Diplomats who have toiled in Vienna since March 1989 to seal the
historic accord reducing conventional arms and other negotiators
working on measures to reduce tension will return to the Austrian
capital on Nov. 26 for further talks.
   Gorbachev urged that the talks include all 34 nations in the
CSCE process, rather than just the 22 NATO and Warsaw Pact
countries who worked on the conventional arms accord.
   Although generally upbeat, Gorbachev did warn of international
conflicts, such as the Gulf crisis, and domestic tensions that
could undo changes in Europe, particularly in the East.
   Rising ethnic tensions and even separatist demands to change
Europe's post-1945 borders could have ``a destructive snowball
effect'' if any government gives way to them, he noted.
   Warning against the Balkanization of entire regions in EUrope,
Gorbachev urged West and East to work together to create new
structures for the continent's environment, economy and technology.
   This constitutes ``the only truly democratic chance of asserting
a positive influence on internal developments in a number of
countries,'' Gorbachev noted.
   Most of Eastern Europe's emerging democracies are rent by
economic woes and ethnic passions. Nowhere is this more evident
than in the Soviet Union, where shops in large cities are barer
than ever before and demands for the independence of the 15
republics and other regions from Moscow grow more strident each
day.

   Following is a transcript of an address delivered
Monday by President Bush at the 34-nation summit of the Conference
on Cooperation and Security in Europe:
   Mr. Chairman, this is a glorious day for Europe. This morning I
signed for my country an arms control agreement which ends the
military confrontation that has cursed this continent for decades.
This afternoon we welcome a summit document, a Charter of Paris,
which expresses the common aspirations of our society. It is right
that we gather here in this magnificent city, a city of
civilization, to declare our hopes for the future and to mark a
grand turn in the course of history.
   Today we do justice to the original framers of the Helsinki
Final Act. The goals they set have proven their worth, thanks to
the courage of so many who dared not merely to hope but to act. We
salute men of courage - Havel and Mazowiecki and Antall here with
us today - and all the other activists who took Helsinki's goals as
solemn commitments, and who suffered so that these commitments
would be honored.
   And we salute all those individuals and private groups in the
West who showed that the protection of human rights is not just the
business of governments - it's everyone's business:
non-governmental organizations, the press, religious leaders, and
ordinary citizens. Their dreams are being realized before our eyes.
Thenew democracies of Central and Eastern Europe have ended
decades of depression to rediscover their birthright of freedom. In
the Soviet Union, the seeds of democracy and human rights have
found new soil, and at long last the cruel division of Germany has
come to an end.
   A continent frozen in hostility for so long has become a
continent of revolutionary change. To assure that this change
occurs in a secure framework, we have completed a conventional arms
control treaty that transforms the military map of this continent.
   We are adopting confidence and security-building measures that
will contribute to lasting peace through openness.
   This morning, 22 of us signed a solemn undertaking on the
non-use of force. But today, as old political divisions disappear,
other sources of tension, some ancient, some new, are emerging.
   National disputes persist. ABuses of minority and human rights
continue. Where millions had once been denied the freedom to move,
now millions feel compelled to move to escape economic or political
hardship.
   We are witnessing, in several countries, the ugly resurgence of
anti-Semitism and other ethnic, racial and religious intolerance.
   Bigotry and hatred have no place in civilized nations.
Minorities enrich our societies. Protection of their rights is a
prerequisite for stability.
   Europe is entering unknown waters. The CSCE is ideally suited to
help its member states navigate. We have articulated fine standards
for national behavior, and now it is our task to bring CSCE down to
earth, making it part of everyday politics, building and drawing on
its strength to address the new challenges.
   My government put forward some ideas for the future development
of the CSCE earlier this year, and I hope that they contributed to
the initiatives that the members of the North Atlantic Alliance
announced at our London summit in July, and I am pleased to see
that so many of the ideas discussed there have emerged in the
summit declaration that we will sign this week.
   Let me highlight how we think some of these initiatives and
others will help the CSCE put its principles into practice. The
declaration we will sign establishes an agenda to guide our work
until we meet again in Helsinki. This is important work on issues
vital to all of us, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the role
of minorities in our societies, the construction of democratic
institutions, and most fundamental of all, the enhancement of human
rights.

   The U.S. military today canceled
a second attempt at a mock invasion on a Saudi beach because of
poor weather and said it was scrapping the maneuver.
   The Marine assault in water-skimming hovercraft was expected to
have been one of the dramatic highlights of the first joint
U.S.-Saudi military exercise, codenamed Imminent Thunder. The
six-day exercise ends Wednesday.
   The Marines had tried to storm the beach on Sunday and today,
but heavy seas and high winds prevented the mock invasion. The U.S.
military said there would not be a third attempt.
   Maj. Gen. Harry W. Jenkins Jr., commander of the Marine
Expeditionary Brigade, said he thought Sunday's amphibious landing
would have gone ahead in a real war, but there was no need to risk
casualties for a drill.
   Some officers aboard the amphibious landing ship USS Gunston
Hall, however, said similar conditions could thwart planned
landings in actual combat.
   Winter seas in the gulf normally average 2 to 4 feet, but the
season is characterized by periodic north winds during which waves
reach 8 to 15 feet, according to Navy officials.
   The high seas usually occur about two times each winter, between
October and January.
   On Sunday, helicopters from the USS Guam deposited 400 troops in
the mock invasion force on a Saudi beach 80 miles south of the
Kuwaiti border. U.S., British and French warplanes roared overhead,
giving simulated air support. Among the troops were 36 Saudi
Arabian marines.
   Jenkins called the exercise a success, even without the Marine
landings, because it showed the allied forces could work together.
   ``I was pleased we've had as few glitches as we've had so far
because it's tough to bring everyone together,'' he said.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has denounced the exercises as
provocative.
   Navy Cmdr. Christopher J. Ellis of Fairfax Station, Va., the
U.S. adviser to the Saudi navy, said he believes news leaks caused
the military to move the exercise. Media reports last week said it
would be 10 miles from the Kuwaiti border.
   Yet it was too close to Iraqi forces for some Marines.
   ``I'm not gonna lie - I'm scared. But if anything goes down, I'm
ready,'' said Pfc. Felipe Williams.
   Jenkins insisted the exercise was not meant to threaten Saddam.
   But Saudi Marine Capt. Muhammad al-Aseeri said he was pleased
only a few dozen Saudi marines were involved. ``We don't want more
troops because Saddam Hussein might take it too seriously,'' he
said.
   Marine Maj. John Toolan of New York said he wanted to use the
exercise to send a message to Saddam: ``We're ready and capable to
carry out our president's orders.''
   Defense analysts said Imminent Thunder's main aim is to test the
air-strike capability of the multinational force deployed in the
gulf following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The exercise is using 1,100 warplanes - double Iraq's air power
- and represents the largest use of aircraft in an exercise during
Operation Desert Shield. No ammunition is being fired.
   ``The aviation part has gone very well,'' Jenkins said. ``It's
evidence of the flexibility we have.''
   Under U.S. military rules, the amphibious section of Imminent
Thunder was covered by several media pools. But there was no pool
monitoring air operations.
   The Marines have practiced amphibious landings in Bahrain and
Oman, but this was the first on Saudi soil.
   The amphibious assault was supposed to commence 25 miles
offshore in a technique called ``over the horizon'' because shore
can't be seen when the amphibious craft are launched. But winds of
20 to 25 mph have stirred up choppy waves estimated at 4 feet to 10
feet.
   The Marine's hulking air-cushioned amphibious landing craft are
designed to skim over the waves and roar onto a beach, carrying
Marines and tracked vehicles.
   One was launched Sunday from the Gunston Hall but it foundered
in the choppy gulf, its engines sputtering and groaning. After a
lengthy struggle, it returned to the ship and the seaborne assault
was scrapped.

   The person most likely to succeed William J.
Bennett as director of the nation's drug control strategy is
Florida Gov. Bob Martinez, who recently lost his re-election bid, a
White House official says.
   Bennett, meanwhile, is in line to become chairman of the
Republican National Committee in January, Republican sources said
over the weekend. He would take over for the ailing Lee Atwater,
39, who has been undergoing intensive treatment for a cancerous
brain tumor.
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, chairman of the House Select Committee
on Narcotics, said today President Bush should not nominate
Martinez.
   ``The president needs to take advantage of this opportunity and
appoint to he position of national drug control policy director not
someone who has lost an election, but someone who is acceptable to
Republicans and Democrats,'' Rangel said. The nominee should be
chosen ``not because of his political resume, but for his continued
dedication and ability to be successful as a commander in the war
on drugs.''
   The 55-year-old Martinez ``is probably going to be the next drug
czar,'' said the White House official, who spoke Sunday on
condition of anonymity. ``Nobody else is being actively
considered.''
   Officially, the White House was mum, as was Martinez's
spokesman.
   ``I don't have any details on candidates, I'm afraid,'' said
White House spokesman Bill Harlow, contacted in Paris where he was
traveling with the president. ``As far as I know, no decision has
been made on that position.''
   The governor's spokesman, Jon Peck, said from Tallahassee, ``At
this point, everything is just speculation.'' Martinez would
consider the position if asked by Bush, but ``that's not to say
that it's something he has been actively working to get.''
   Martinez was trounced in his re-election effort by former Sen.
Lawton Chiles, losing by a 57-43 percent margin. He was only the
second Republican governor in Florida since Reconstruction. His
term ends Jan. 8, when CHiles is to be inaugurated.
   Bush traveled to Florida three times to campaign for Martinez,
and first lady Barbara Bush made a campaign commercial on his
behalf. Jeb Bush, one of the president's sons, was Martinez's
campaign chairman.
   Florida has had a lot of experience with drug problems. Most of
the nation's cocaine supply went through Florida until the
mid-1980s, when a crackdown there pushed traffickers west to Mexico
and the southwest U.S. border states.
   The national drug strategy compiled by Bennett's Office of
National Drug Control Policy last January designated the Miami area
as one of country's five high-intensity drug trafficking areas,
enabling it to receive additional federal anti-drug assistance.
   Bennett, 47, announced his resignation Nov. 8 after 20 months on
the job. He will remain in the post until Nov. 30, aides say.
   An administration source confirmed Sunday that Bennett - who was
education secretary for President Reagan but did not become a
Republican until 1986 - had made up his mind to accept the GOP job
on Saturday morning. Initially, he had planned to become a fellow
at a conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Institute,
and write books on drugs and education.
   Bush brushed aside reporters' questions Sunday about Bennett
taking the RNC job.
   ``We're not discussing that,'' he said with a smile. ``A lot
happens when I leave.''
   Atwater, who managed Bush's 1988 presidential campaign, will
assume the title of ``general chairman'' of the party, said a
senior administration official in Paris traveling with the
president. Asked whether the idea was Bush's or Atwater's, the
official said, ``It was both.''
   A GOP source said a formal announcement of Bennett's new job
would not be made until Bush returned at the end of the week from
his eight-day trip to Europe and the Persian Gulf.
   Despite his job as Bush's chief lieutenant in the war on drugs,
Bennett has spoken out on such issues as education and abortion,
and he made numerous campaign trips around the country prior to the
Nov. 6 election.
   Bennett called Rangel a ``gasbag'' shortly after announcing his
resignation from the drug post.
   Rangel, long at odds with Bennett over drug issues, said, ``I
formally welcome Mr. Bennett to the political fray.
   ``I am happy to see the president believes Bill Bennett is more
qualified in a partisan political post than as coordinator of
national anti-drug efforts,'' Rangel said.
   Bennett boasted Nov. 8 that the Bush administration's drug
strategy was working and that Americans have turned against drugs.
   Reports from hospital emergency rooms show the number of
cocaine-related visits have declined in the past few months.
Surveys also have shown that casual use of all drugs is declining,
and cocaine supplies are drying up, illustrated by higher prices
and declining purity.
   However, violence in many large cities is increasing. Bennett
has attributed the increased murder rate to drug traffickers vying
for shares of the dwindling market.

   Construction workers in a town
northwest of Prague found an unexploded American bomb from World
War II on Monday, forcing authorities to evacuate residential
areas, the CTK news agency said.
   The 1,000-pound bomb was found in soil brought to a construction
site from the outskirts of the town of Most, about 50 miles
northwest of Prague.
   Some people living near the construction site had to be
temporarily evacuated, the report said.
   Experts placed the bomb on a truck loaded with sand and were
transporting it to a military site nears Mimon, about 45 miles
north of Prague, to be defused, CTK said.
   Experts said the bomb contained 660 pounds of TNT with a
chemical detonating device.

   An 11-year-old boy whose parents come from Sri
Lanka was hailed on Monday as the youngest student in a British
university.
   Ganesh Sittapalam is at school in Wimbledon, south London, with
boys of his own age, studying the usual range of subjects, but for
mathematics he goes to Surrey University in Guildford. He is
managing a year's work in one day a week there among students
nearly twice his age.
   ``You can't help liking him,'' fellow student Jon Lewis, 20,
said. ``He sits here blowing bubblegum while solving incredibly
complicated problems.''
   ``He is a very normal 11-year-old, but he has a fantastic flair
for maths,'' said the boy's tutor at Surrey, DOnald Keedwell.
   Ganesh's parents are both mathematicians and his father, Arjuna
Sittapalam, is an investment banker in London's City financial
district.
   London's Daily Telegraph quoted Ganesh as saying: ``I like
maths, computers, reading and Lego. Ambition? I don't think I have
got one really. I will probably follow a career in maths.''

<TEXT>
   Aftershocks from a strong earthquake
jolted Indonesia's northern Sumatra region, and a 13-year-old girl
was trampled to death when her family fled its home in panic,
police said Monday.
   A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
girl was killed in Blang Kejeren, a remote district in the Bukit
Barisan mountains, about 115 miles from the aftershocks' epicenter.
   No other details were provided, and no other casualties or
damage were reported in the aftershocks, which began Sunday. Police
said most Blang Kejeren residents have been afraid to return to
their homes.
   The Meteorological Agency said the aftershocks measured up to
4.6 on the Richter scale and were centered about 95 miles southwest
of the north Sumatran capital of Medan, or about 845 miles
northwest of Jakarta.
   The aftershocks followed an earthquake Thursday that measured
6.2 on the Richter scale. It injured hundreds of people, damaged
hundreds of buildings and caused landslides that cut traffic
between the southeast provincial city of Kutacane and Blang Kejeren
in Aceh province.
   Damage has been estimated at $2.6 million, police said.
   An aftershock measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale also shook the
Malaysian island of Penang on Monday, said a spokesman of
Malaysia's Meteorological Department, speaking on condition of
anonymity. No casualties or damage were immediately reported.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on seismographs.
A quake of 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas while 7 is
a major quake capable of widespread, heavy damage.

   The invitations have gone out, and
hundreds of monkeys are eagerly awaiting their second annual
sit-down brunch courtesy of a hotel owner.
   Yongyoot Kitwattanusoan, owner of the Lopburi Inn, said Monday
he is spending $32,000 to throw the bash - complete with waiters,
menus and napkins - for about 600 monkeys on Sunday.
   Yongyoot offers the meal to thank the monkeys for the success of
his hotel in Lopburi, a small provincial capital about 70 miles
north of Bangkok. The monkeys, who stay at the Buddhist shrine of
Wat Pra Karn, are symbols of good fortune and a prime attraction
for tourists.
   He said he sent 60 invitation cards to the monkeys, who grabbed
them and leapt back up the shrine.
   ``We invite all the monkeys to attend a meal party on the
occasion of the second anniversary of the Lopburi Inn. On Nov. 25
at 10 a.m.,'' the cards said.
   It will be a sit-down affair, if Yongyoot can keep the furry
creatures seated at the 50 tables.
   ``We will serve vegetarian food, including American fried rice,
vegetable salad, papaya, various kinds of fruit and dessert,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   ``Last year, tens of thousands of people came to see the Lopburi
monkeys eat the food we hosted for them,'' he said.
   This year, the spread is larger - Yongyoot said a count by the
keepers of the temple found there were 100 more monkeys than last
year.

   When Chuck Bergensky looks at the
grimy sandstone walls of the West Virginia Penitentiary, he sees
thousands and thousands of happy shoppers.
   ``I visualize a very successful outlet shopping mall. I see
things like a parking lot for 1,000 cars in the prison yard and 35
or 40 shops inside the walls,'' the city manager said.
   And not only that.
   ``We would keep some of the cellblocks to attract people and
maybe put the electric chair on display,'' he said Friday.
   Bergensky and a group of businessmen and others have proposed
turning the Civil War-era prison into a mall after it closes in
1992 under court order.
   The city is spending about $13,000 for architectural and
feasibility studies. If the city and a state-appointed economic
development group decide to go ahead with the idea, the prison will
be sold or leased to developers for conversion.
   The maximum-security penitentiary resembles a medieval fortress,
with parapets, gun slots and arches. Its 24-foot walls were
quarried with convict labor. Now blackened by pollution, the walls
are 7 feet thick at the base and taper to 28 inches at the top.
   Stuart Patz, a Vienna, Va., consultant, said preliminary figures
indicate the mall could attract busloads of tourists and shoppers
from Pittsburgh, about 85 miles to the northeast. He declined to
estimate what the project would cost.
   ``All indications are that the project is feasible,'' Patz said.
He said he expects to complete an analysis of the project by early
December.
   The prison stands on a 10-acre plot in a residential area in
this Ohio River town of 11,000. It still houses the gallows where
85 men were hanged from 1899 to 1949. Nine men died in the prison's
electric chair from 1951 to 1959.
   In 1973, it was the site of a major riot. In 1979, a police
officer and an inmate were killed when 15 inmates escaped. In 1986,
three inmates were killed and more than a dozen prison workers
taken hostage in a New Year's Day riot.
   Underfunding and overcrowding prompted a judge in 1983 to
declare prison conditions unconstitutional. In 1988, after millions
were spent on improvements, the state Supreme Court ordered the
place closed, saying conditions had become too appalling to
correct.
   The prison has about 550 inmates, down from a peak of about
1,200 in the 1970s. A new maximum-security prison is being built in
Fayette County.
   Moundsville officials dread the time when the prison and its 300
jobs leave. They say a mall could stem unemployment and provide the
impetus to reopen a factory and other businesses.
   ``I think it would be a great thing for the city of Moundsville
to carry on with the prison and make it a place that people want to
come to,'' said Mayor Dorothy Durig. ``We could even stage
breakouts twice a day.''
   Nanette Collins, 45, lives a block from the prison and doesn't
want to see it torn down.
   ``It's a landmark,'' she said. ``I don't think that anyone would
be bothered by the fact that it was a prison. People are curious
and they'd get a chance to see what a prison really looks like.''
   Not everyone likes the idea.
   ``I think they could find a better place to build a shopping
mall,'' said Robert Leach, 33, an inmate serving two life sentences
without parole for two murders. ``Considering its history, I don't
know why the public would want anything to do with it.''

   Barbara Bush joined Europe's first ladies Monday on
a sightseeing trip encompassing the Louvre and Versailles. It
proved to be a pain in the neck - literally - for one of the group,
Hannelore Kohl.
   The tour concluded with a gourmet luncheon hosted by French
first lady Danielle Mitterrand.
   Among the guests at Versailles' Grand Trianon palace was Mrs.
Kohl, whose meal ended prematurely.
   As photographers rushed to take pictures of Mrs. Bush, one of
them accidentally bumped into the wife of German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl. The French photographer's camera and heavy lens grazed her
neck as they slipped off his shoulder.
   Mrs. Kohl winced and began rubbing the wound while Mrs. Bush
expressed her concern. Mrs. Kohl excused herself from the table
after being hurt. The photographer said he was unaware of the
incident when it happened, and he later apologized to the GErman
leader's wife.
   Raisa Gorbachev, soberly dressed in a navy blue and white
pin-striped suit, high-necked white blouse and spiked heels, was
the last to arrive - skipping the guided tour of the Grand Trianon,
built in pink marble in 1687 by Louis XIV to accommodate his
volatile private life.
   She exchanged warm greetings with Mrs. Bush, who wore a black
and white houndstooth suit, a paisley blouse and her trademark
double-strand choker pearls.
   The group enjoyed a four-course meal prepared by one of France's
leading caterers. The menu included coquilles St. Jacques and

Ice cream, all washed down by three vintage French wines.
   Earlier in the day, Mrs. Bush inspected I.M. Pei's tall glass
pyramid which caps the new entrance to the Louvre. The small group,
which included SUsan Baker, wife of the Secretary of State, and
Mary Curley, wife of American Ambassador Walter J.P. Curley, saw
the highlights of the Louvre's vast renovation program.
   Recounting the history of the museum, built by King Philippe
Auguste as a fortress in 1200 to protect Paris from invaders,
Louvre director Michel Laclotte took Mrs. Bush through softly
illuminated underground displays of the medieval tower base and
thick walls unearthed during recent excavations.
   She appeared fascinated with a solid gold helmet, dug from a
latrine dating to the 18th century when city life centered around
the Louvre.
   Mrs. Bush's next stop was the Nissim de Camondo museum, a
reconstitution of an 18th-century private home. Recently
refurbished for $16 million, it houses a priceless collection of
period furnishings, tapestries, china and antiques that exemplify
pre-revolutionary French luxury.
   ``Isn't this the darndest place you ever saw?'' she asked as she
climbed a spiral staircase. ``It's hard to think of children
charging around this house.''
   Asked if she thought President Bush would like the oval-shaped
wood-panelled library, she rolled her eyes and grinned.
   ``He'd be tasteless if he didn't love it,'' she said.

<HEAD>Twenty-five Workers Injured In Channel Tunnel Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANGATTE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A work train loaded with construction
materials for the tunnel beneath the English Channel collided with
a rail car Monday, injuring 25 workers.
   Officials for contractors working on the tunnel to link Britain
and France said six of the workers were injured seriously and were
hospitalized in Calais.
   The others suffered cuts and bruises and were treated at
Sangatte, the main construction site for the French side of the
tunnel.
   The accident happened several hundred yards below the ground's
surface in the access tunnel leading to the portion under the
channel, the officials said.
   The two trains were on the same rail line, and the one carrying
the workers crashed into the one carrying cargo after the latter
ran out of fuel, they said.
   Eight workers were injured in a similar accident Oct. 30, the
day workers sent a 2-inch probe through the last 100 yards of chalk
separating the British and French halves of the project's service
tunnel.
   The link-up marked a turning point in the financially plagued
project. The Channel Tunnel is scheduled to open to rail traffic in
1993.
   In all, eight workers have died on the project, seven on the
British side and one on the French.

   Sen. Dennis DeConcini today strongly defended
himself against wrongdoing in his dealings with savings and loan
owner Charles Keating Jr. and accused the Senate Ethics Committee's
special counsel of relying on ``lies ... and hearsay.''
   ``I submit this is disgraceful. I submit there is a bias, and I
think it is unconscionable,'' DeConcini said of allegations by the
Senate committee's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, who is presenting the
case against the so-called ``Keating Five.''
   DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat, was the last of the five
senators to offer an opening statement defending himself to the
ethics committee. He said Bennett's evidence ``contains hearsay ...
contains rumors, unfounded allegations about all of the senators.''
   The other accused senators, Republican John McCain of Arizona
and Democrats Alan Cranston of California, John Glenn of Ohio and
Donald Riegle of Michigan, offered emotional personal statements on
Friday against allegations they improperly intervened with federal
regulators on behalf of Keating, a financial contributor to their
campaigns and causes.
   DeConcini read from a prepared statement and stopped often to
read from letters, memos and other evidence he said Bennett had
left out or used selectively in his presentation. He denounced
``derogatory information, lies and allegations and hearsay that Mr.
Bennett goes out and gets people to give.''
   DeConcini concluded his statement on an emotional note, calling
for reform in the campaign financing laws but insisting he had
nothing to apologize for.
   ``To do other than dismiss the charges against me is unjust,''
DeConcini said. ``I broke no law. I broke no rule. I broke no
standard. I committed no improper conduct. ... There's been no
unethical conduct by this senator.''
   DeConcini also complained that he had been treated more harshly
by Bennett than McCain, his Arizona colleague, and said the
relationship between Bennett and McCain was ``kind of cozy.''
   He said Bennett had failed to ask McCain about his wife's
investments with Keating, and without pressing him on family
vacations the McCains took at Keating's vacation spot. Bennett
mentioned both last week but dismissed them as without serious
consequence.
special prosecutor.''
   DeConcini said it was ``ridiculous'' for Bennett to suggest that
campaign contributions from Keating or any other constituent were
tied to his efforts to help those with ``a legitimate beef'' with
the federal government.
   ``They have a right to ask for your intervention,'' DeConcini
said.
   He said federal regulators and bureaucrats ``often are wrong''
in dealing with constituents, and ``somebody ought to stand up
for'' them.
   At the time, Keating was an Arizona businessman and owner of the
Irvine, Calif.,-based Lincoln Savings and Loan, whose 1989 collapse
and federal seizure is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion.
   DeConcini said he did no more for Keating than he would for
other constituents, without regard to campaign contributions.
   ``I'm accessible. I talk to constituents. I call them back on
the phone myself if I can,' he said.
   In defending his involvement with Keating, DeConcini said
Keating ``is a different person than he is perceived today.'' He
said Keating had contributed substantially to Mother Teresa, who
was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her work with the poor.
   DeConcini also attacked the motives of Common Cause, the
lobbying and public interest group whose original complaint sparked
the ethics panel's probe into the five senators.
   ``I can tell you what they're trying to achieve - they're trying
to raise money. They're trying to damage the reputation of a number
of senators. ... I think it's a travesty,'' DeConcini said.
   After DeConcini's opening statement, Bennett was to begin
presenting evidence and calling witnesses.
   Bennett's case centers on meetings between the five senators and
federal banking regulators as the regulators were preparing to
recommend criminal investigation of Lincoln by the Justice
Department.
   Keating, who faces criminal fraud charges in California and is
the object of civil fraud suits, said through his attorney he wants
to testify before the committee, but only if he receives immunity.
   The Keating case presents the Ethics Committee with the
difficult question of what actions by senators on behalf of
political contributors are improper.
   Among the five, Bennett has suggested that DeConcini and
Cranston were most deeply involved with Keating.
   Evidence shows DeConcini ``was asked repeatedly to perform
services for Charles Keating, and that Senator DeConcini almost
always honored Mr. Keating's request,'' Bennett said.
   Bennett said an April 1987 meeting that four of the senators
held with Edwin Gray, then top bank regulator, was organized by
DeConcini ``with the intent to place tremendous political pressure
on Chairman Gray to achieve a specific outcome desired by Charles
Keating.''
   In that meeting, Bennett said, DeConcini proposed a deal to drop
a proposed banking rule that Keating opposed, while in exchange
Lincoln would make more home loans.
   He also said Keating ``enlisted Senator DeConcini in his effort
to drive Chairman Gray from office.''
   Bennett said DeConcini continued trying to assist Keating even
after the senators were told on April 9, 1987, that bank regulators
planned criminal referrals involving Lincoln. DeConcini's efforts,
the counsel said, included calls in April 1989 in an effort to
persuade bank regulators to allow the sale of Lincoln, after
Lincoln had learned that results of a new bank examination ``were
going to be disastrously negative.''
   DeConcini received $48,100 in contributions from Keating and
associates for his 1988 re-election campaign, which he later
returned, and $33,000 for his 1982 campaign.

   A deputy interior minister revealed Monday that
more than 1.5 million Soviets use illegal drugs, a figure nearly
five times higher than previous official statistics on drug abuse.
   The sale of illegal drugs, mostly marijuana and hashish, also
contributes $1.8 billion a year to the Soviet Union's flourishing
underground economy, Sergeyev Troshin said on the first day of a
conference of heads of European anti-drug agencies.
   He said the problem will worsen as the Soviet Union loosens
border restrictions and increases contacts with the West.
   Troshin did not give figures on illegal drug use from previous
years, and it could not immediately be determined which forms of
drug use had increased in the country of 285 million people.
   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin last summer had said there were
220,000 ``drug abusers'' and 40,000 ``addicts'' in the country.
   Soviet authorities once maintained that social problems such as
drug abuse and alcoholism were mainly products of capitalist
systems, and they did not release such statistics for the Soviet
population.
   Troshin was elected chairman of the five-day conference, the
first time drug agencies from Eastern and Western Europe have come
together to combat drug trafficking across the continent.
   Representatives from 28 European countries, the United States,
Canada and the United Nations were attending the gathering.
   ``If we take into account the expanding contacts (with the West)
and the forthcoming emigration bill which will bring about
increased contacts, we must presuppose that the trend will get
worse,'' Troshin said at news conference.
   The Soviet legislature has been debating a bill to allow Soviet
citizens free entry to and exit from the country, but has not set a
date for a vote.
   ``The development of events in our country and in Europe in
general has shown to everybody that it is necessary to join efforts
in the fight with the plague of the 20th century, which is the
illegal trafficking in drugs,'' Troshin said.
   U.N. undersecretary-general Margaret Anstee, who coordinates the
organization's drug-abuse programs, said the drug problem was
worsening in Western Europe.
   ``But as the government of the U.S.S.R. has recognized, the
tentacles of this problem are also stretching eastward and it's
becoming an increasing concern to the authorities here,'' she said.
   Troshin said 80 percent to 90 percent of illegal drug use in the
Soviet Union involves products of the cannabis plant. Opium is the
second most popular illegal substance, followed by narcotic
medicines, he said.
   Also, alcohol is abused by 20 million to 25 million Soviet
citizens, he said.
   ``We have to join our efforts because of relationship with
Europe is on the increase and the flow of immigration is increasing
and we already know of cases of smuggling of drugs,'' Troshin said.
   Mrs. Anstee said she hoped the meeting would come up with
concrete proposals ``as to how cooperation can be strengthened in
the fight against illicit drug abuse, illicit drug trafficking, all
over Europe.''

   Comedian Bill Cosby accepted an
honorary doctoral degree from Rust College, then bestowed it on a
student who overcame dyslexia to earn a graduate degree.
   During a speech Sunday at the northern Mississippi college's
124th Founder's Day celebration, Cosby gave Rust graduate Troy
Brown his royal blue hood in recognition of Brown's academic
achievements.
   ``He came here with an awful lot of differences - about himself
and about his family. This school took him and showed him love and
understanding,'' said Cosby, 53.
   Brown overcame dyslexia with help from faculty at 1,000-student
Rust College and went on to earn a graduate degree from Alcorn
State University. Brown is now working toward a doctorate in
educational psychology at the University of Mississippi.
   Cosby urged young people to look to their parents, grandparents
and teachers for role models:
   ``They're the ones who read you the Bible and the old people who
tell you the truth. Your role model on TV doesn't even know you.''

   LAGUNA NIGUEL, Calif. (AP) - Who better to invite to a champagne
festival than Robin Leach, who has made a career out of purveying
dreams of ostentatious wealth.
   Leach was the guest of honor at the Tete de Cuvee Champagne
Brunch at the fifth World of Wines Festival on Sunday at the Ritz
Carlton Hotel.
   The host of television's ``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous''
and several spinoffs joined about 450 others at the festival to
quaff 420 bottles of champagne, each selling for $60 to $100 each.
   ``It's an extraordinary elixir,'' Leach said of the bubbly.
``The breakfast of champions.''
   The former Fleet Street reporter received the festival's first
Bon Vivant award, represented by - what else? - a crystal champagne
cooler.
   ```Champagne wishes and caviar dreams' seem to very aptly and
succinctly sum up an attitude we have toward life,'' Leach said of
his trademark phrase.

   SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) - Squealing little girls and a high
school pep band greeted Gina Marie Tolleson on her triumphant
return home as the new Miss World.
   ``I'm just really, really touched to see all my family and
friends here,'' the 21-year-old University of Georgia student, who
returned home to celebrate Thanksgiving in Spartanburg, said
Sunday.
   She was crowned Miss World on Nov. 8 in London.
   Spartanburg Mayor Pro Tem Chester Brown, after awarding her the
city's Distinguished Citizen Award, said that next week would be
officially declared Gina Tolleson week.
   Miss Tolleson's studies at the University of Georgia at Athens
are on hold during her reign as Miss World. She is seeking a
broadcast journalism degree.
   ``I'm not interested in being a movie star or film star. ... I'm
determined to go back and finish my education,'' she said.

idea who he was, but their parents eagerly listened to Peter Noone
reprise his 1960s hits.
   Noone, the handsome crooner known as Herman of the British rock
group Herman's Hermits, performed a benefit concert Sunday for El
Montecito Early School. Noone's daughter, 4-year-old Natalie,
attends the school for children in pre-school through third grade.
   ``Aren't we lucky?'' Noone asked. ``I know everybody here. It's

<TEXT>
   Police perched on rooftops, posed as streetsweepers
and escorted motorcades atop glossy white motorcycles, minding both
men and manners Monday at the landmark European summit.
   Up to 10,000 police fanned out over Paris as 34 heads of state
and government, 1,000 delegates and some 5,000 journalists gathered
for the three-day meeting of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
   Authorities sealed off an entire neighborhood near the Arc de
Triomphe where the meeting was held, banning traffic, closing a
metro station and diverting 15 bus lines.
   They had spent a month combing the streets of the posh quarter,
interrogating residents and shopkeepers and even installing barbed
wire in strategic parts of the city's vast sewer system - a
historic haunt for ne'er-do-wells.
   On Monday, the eyes of the law were everywhere. Sharpshooters
perched on rooftops, legions of riot police surveyed the streets
around the Champs-Elysees while collegues scanned the city from
armchairs in a newly modernized surveillance command post at police
headquarters.
   Police spokesman Marcel Vinzerich confirmed a report that some
undercover police took up the green brooms of the city's sanitation
department or posed as merchants in the strategic triangle sealed
off around the Kleber International Conference Center.
   ``Lots of preventative measures have been taken.'' said
Vinzerich in a telephone interview.
   He noted, however, that the 10,000-strong force is only half the
size of that deployed in 1989 when France hosted a summit of the
world's seven richest nations amid gala celebrations for the
bicentennial of the French Revolution.
   ``This is a big job but this time we don't have the crowds to
handle,'' said Vinzerich.
   All 34 leaders were invited to speak at the plenary sessions,
and the order was decided by draw, said an official of the Foreign
Ministry's Office of Protocol.
   Nothing in the domaine of protocol is accidental, and observers
noted with amusement the seating arrangement for the leaders' first
lunch.
   With due logic, Finnish President Mauno Koivisto, in deference
to the 1975 Helsinki Final Act which started the CSCE process, took
the place of honor at the table, across from President Francois
Mitterrand of France.
   But at the right of Mitterrand, Cypriot President Georges
Vassiliou faced Turkish President Turgut Ozal, despite the long
conflict involving the two nations. And U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar had at his left Arnold Koller of
Switzerland, the only CSCE country which is not a member of the
United Nations.

   Berliners who fearfully stockpiled tons of meat,
milk and grain to guard against a four-decade Soviet threat now
want to ship the stored food to people who really need it - the
Soviets themselves.
   Former West Berlin, once pushed to the brink of starvation by a
Soviet blockade, has asked the German government to use the old
emergency provisions to help ease dire shortages in the Soviet
Union.
   The federal government is expected to make a decision this week.
   ``The material is not necessary any more, the situation has
changed,'' Juergen Varnhorn, a Berlin government spokesman, said
Monday. ``So why not help the Soviet Union?''
   Berlin's plan to ship supplies to the very nation that made such
emergency stockpiles necessary is yet another of the ironies that
have followed German unification and Soviet disintegration.
   Germany now is paying Soviet troops based in eastern Germany and
will finance their withdrawal over the next four years.
   One of those soldiers ran amok early Monday with an armored
vehicle, roaring down the Kurfuerstendamm, the main shopping street
in former West Berlin. It would have been an international incident
during the Cold War, but now is a local police matter.
   The scores of fortified storehouses stuffed with canned
vegetables and fruit, powdered milk and coffee are true relics of
the Cold War, and a direct result of the Soviet blockade of West
Berlin three years after Germany lost World War II.
   The Soviets, who had control of the east side of the city and
the surrounding territory that was to become East Germany, closed
roads, waterways and railroads leading to West Berlin in 1948 in an
effort to drive out the Western Allies.
   West Berliners were confined to the city for 36 days without
food and coal. The Allies then launched the famous Berlin airlift,
flying 1.8 million tons of goods into the city and breaking the
blockade.
   The Soviets lifted the blockade on May 12, 1949, but tensions
worsened and culminated with the construction of the Berlin Wall in
1961.
   West Berlin, meanwhile, stockpiled enormous quanities of food,
clothing and medicine as a hedge against the chance that the
Soviets would launch another blockade.
   That threat evaporated with the opening of the Berlin Wall last
year and German unification on Oct. 3, sweeping changes wrought by
the reform policies of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Berlin Senate, in a gesture of goodwill, voted to ask Bonn
for permission to send the food to the Soviets one week before
Gorbachev's Nov. 9 visit to Germany, the first anniversary of the
opening of the Berlin Wall.
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel, in a interview Monday with the
German newspaper Die Welt, said the government was considering the
proposal as one of the ways Germany could provide relief to the
Soviets during what is expected to be a dangerous winter of severe
shortages.
   The supplies include hundreds of thousands of tons of sugar,
milk, toothpaste, grain, coal, heating oil and other provisions
worth up to $1.6 billion.
   Varnhorn said only the food supplies would be sent to the
Soviets. No decision has been made on what to do with the medicine,
clothing and cleaning materials still in storage.
   Food already is being rationed in several Soviet cities and
rationing is to begin next month in Leningrad, the nation's
second-largest city.
   President Bush said he would be willing to provide emergency
food supplies and humanitarian aid to the Soviets, and other
Western nations have said they also may provide aid to get the
politically torn and economically reeling nation through the
winter.

   Many people cook an elaborate feast just once a
year, on Thanksgiving.
   Anthony Dias Blue and his wife, Kathryn K. Blue, think about
that dinner all year long, and they have written a book,
``Thanksgiving Dinner'' (HarperCollins), about it.
   ``This is 20 years of fine-tuning our techniques and dealing
with what our children will eat,'' Blue, a widely syndicated wine
columnist, said in a recent interview.
   ``Thanksgiving is not a potluck dinner; it is a complex feast
that requires organization and considerable precision,'' the Blues
write. And they plan ahead: a menu by Nov. 1, all staples bought
two weeks ahead and kept in separate boxes, fresh turkey ordered
ahead.
   On Thursday, an estimated 45 million turkeys will be cooked, and
family after family will confront the age-old conundrum of whether
to stuff or not.
   Rick Rodgers, author of ``The Turkey Cookbook,'' recommends
roasting a turkey with onions, celery and carrots in its cavities
and cooking the stuffing - or dressing - on the side.
   Although an unstuffed turkey cooks faster and more evenly, and
the Blues ``have been on both sides of the big stuffing question''
over the years, Blue said he finds the ``synergism between the
turkey and stuffing'' to be more important.
   The Blues will roast two turkeys, both stuffed, for the 22
people who will be at their dinner Thursday in their home in San
Francisco. One turkey will hold a sausage-crouton stuffing, the
other an oyster-cornbread stuffing.
   Their table also will hold a root vegetable puree and other
vegetables, cranberry relish, prune chutney, steamed persimmon
pudding, pumpkin flan and gingerbread bread pudding.
   ``There are certain things in every family that have to be
made,'' Blue said, adding that for his family, it's Schatze's corn
pudding, which his mother made for decades.
   ``It has things I don't approve of - canned corn, evaporated
milk,'' Blue said. But when made with fresh ingredients, it wasn't
as good, he said.
   ``My kids absolutely adore it,'' said Blue, who usually passes
it by.
   But one of the advantages of Thanksgiving dinner is that there
are choices. The cook need not double or triple recipes; instead,
make more dishes and let people pick and choose, Blue advises.
said.
   ``That's what this is all about - the feast of the harvest. I
would never have a strawberry dessert,'' because the fruit is out
of season, he said.
   And he frowns on chocolate for Thanksgiving, although there are
three desserts that call for it in his book - the carrot torte,
chocolate pecan pie and chocolate-chestnut mousse.
   On his radio program, Blue said, he once ``tore apart'' a caller
who suggested asparagus, fresh in springtime, for Thanksgiving.
``Our delivery system has gotten too good. It takes a little bit of
the joy out of the seasonal changes of eating.''
   The Blues include 150 recipes from appetizers to leftovers in
``Thanksgiving Dinner.''
   They include many from friends in California, but evidence that
Thanksgiving is a family holiday include recipes named for their
children: Amanda's chocolate carrot torte, Caitlin's potatoes,
Jessica's caramelized apple tart and Toby's instant replay
sandwich.
   Thanksgiving certainly is tradition, but not one that officially
dates to 1621 and the Pilgrims, the Blues write. The Pilgrims, and
others who followed, had meals of thanksgiving from time to time.
But a regular, national Thanksgiving holiday began in 1863, when
President Lincoln was persuaded by Sarah Josepha Hale, author of
``Mary Had a Little Lamb,'' to declare it so.
   Under it all, what's so great about Thanksgiving?
   ``You get to eat a lot and you don't have to give presents,''
Blue jokes.

   The United Auto Workers union has ratified the
last of its three-year contracts with the Big Three automakers,
overwhelmingly approving an agreement with CHrysler Corp.
   The agreement, covering about 63,000 active hourly and salaried
workers, was ratified in voting last week by a margin of better
than 4-to-1, UAW spokesman Bob Barbee said Monday. Precise figures
were unavailable.
   The union initially focused its bargaining efforts on General
Motors Corp., and bargainers reached tentative agreement Sept. 17.
Less than a week later, a tentative agreement was reached with Ford
Motor Co. The UAW and Chrysler reached tentative agreement Oct. 30.
   Each contract provides for a 3-percent base wage increase in the
first year and 3-percent lump-sum payments in the second and third
years, and increases for current and future retirees. They also
call for income guarantees for workers laid off for more than 36
weeks from factories closed by sales slumps.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested so many people at a weekend
party, including 43 juveniles, that they had to borrow a city bus
to carry everyone to jail.
   The party Saturday night was so big that it spilled out of a
house belonging to 53-year-old Hazel Bell and into the street,
police said.
   ``It appears that the kids were being charged $2 a head to get
into the party,'' said Police Lt. Bernard Stahl. Neighbors said Ms.
Bell often held large parties.
   Police arrested 43 juveniles, who were charged with curfew
violations, and 59 other people who were charged with disorderly
conduct, Stahl said.
   Ms. Bell was charged with contributing to the delinquency of
minors.

<HEAD>Iraq Says It Will More Than Double Troops in Iraq</HEAD>

   Iraq said today it will send 250,000 more troops to Kuwait, more
than doubling its military strength in the occupied kingdom.
President Bush dismissed Iraq's promise, made a day earlier, to
free all foreigners by March.
   The troop buildup was announced by the Iraqi News Agency 11 days
after Bush said 200,000 more U.S. soldiers would be shipped to the
region to bring the American force to 430,000. Previously, Iraq was
believed to have about 170,000 troops in Kuwait and about 250,000
men in southern Iraq.
   President Saddam Hussein and his military commanders met and
decided to send seven extra divisions of the regular army and
another 150,000 reserves and draftees, the news agency said.
   ``This means the United States will need to mobilize a
3-million-strong force with similar equipment and armament to our
forces'' if it is to attack, the news agency said.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Rick Oborn said the
department would have no comment on the Iraqi report.
   On Sunday, Iraq said it would free the estimated 2,000 remaining
Westerners stranded in Iraq and occupied Kuwait between Christmas
and March 25 ``unless something would take place that mars the
atmosphere of peace.''
   Saddam has been releasing Westerners a few at a time, and scores
of freed Americans flew home from London today.
   Bush called the Iraqi announcement a bid to buy time.
   ``This cynicism of starting to release them on Christmas Day
will be seen by the world as a total ploy,'' he said in Paris,
where NATO and Warsaw Pact leaders signed an arms reduction treaty.
   Bush used the gathering of 34 leaders to try to win more support
for a U.N. resolution authorizing an attack to drive Iraqi forces
from Kuwait.
   Some U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf crisis, including the
Soviet Union and Germany, expressed concern that Bush was rushing
toward war.
   But Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain reiterated her
support for Bush's position, saying that Saddam can avoid war only
by withdrawing quickly from Kuwait.
   ``Most people understand evil has to be stopped. Either he
withdraws, or the military option has to be used,'' she said after
seeing Bush in Paris, where NATO and Warsaw Pact leaders signed an
arms reduction treaty.
   However, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he was sure
a way could be found to avoid war and that he would offer ``new
ideas'' in a meeting with Bush today. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
Germany told Bush on Sunday that all options short of war must
first be exhausted.
   Analysts have said a military strike against Iraqi forces is
most likely in winter because of lower temperatures and generally
calm weather. Sandstorms usually occur in April.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has met in the past week
with foreign ministers from many of the 15 members of the U.N.
Security Council, seeking support for the resolution endorsing a
military assault if the U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Iraq
fails.
   Some diplomats say the proposal could be made before the end of
the month.
   In other developments today, high winds and rough seas forced
U.S. Marines to cancel a second attempt to storm a Saudi beach in
an amphibious landing exercise. Similar conditions forced the
exercise to be scrubbed on Sunday, and officials said no further
attempts will be made.
   Scores of Americans stranded in Iraq and Kuwait left London for
Washington today. Seventy-five Americans were among the 136 former
hostages freed Sunday by Iraq and flown to London on a
U.S.-chartered flight from from Baghdad. Most of the passengers
were wives and children of Kuwaitis.
   ``For four months we have been in hiding,'' said an American
woman who would not give her name. ``People are starving and they
need food, but people who have food are frightened of giving it to
them because they would be accused as collaborators.
   ``We prayed every night that we would wake up in the morning,''
she said.
   Douglas Moore, a British soccer coach who worked in Kuwait for
four years, said many of those in hiding hope for an invasion.
   ``The feeling of those in hiding is that the military should
come and do something for God's sake. They cannot hang on,'' he
said.
   The Saudi government announced that more than 300 Iraqi officers
and soldiers have defected to Saudi Arabia since the invasion of
Kuwait. It was the first time that Saudi Arabia had officially
confirmed defections. Some defectors have been reported to include
Iraqi soldiers with their tanks.

   Even heads of state suffer through life's little
aggravations.
   The limousine carrying Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall to
the 34-nation summit cruised grandly down the street - with its
national flag upside down.
   President Bush had a little limo problem too. The door handles
on the armored car, flown in from Washington, were torn off when
the driver turned a corner a little too tight at the U.S.
ambassador's residence Sunday night.
   New handles were rushed by plane overnight from the United
States.
   When Bush arrived at the Elysee Palace for lunch, it required
considerable jiggling to get the door open. Bush waited inside the
car as two security agents struggled to open the door.
   ---&equals;
   When presidents, prime ministers and premiers gather for a
summit, it's a sure bet they'll pose for an official portrait. It's
called the class photo.
   Together, the 34 leaders here may rule much of the world, but
it's a real question of who's really the boss. Maybe it's the
photographers.
   The leaders snap to attention at a mere shout from the
cameramen. At one point during the shooting of Monday's class
photo, the leaders started leaving their assigned positions,
apparently having had enough.
   But the photographers, in unison, shouted ``No!'' Hurriedly, the
leaders returned to their assigned positions. Bush and German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl finally decided it was time to leave and
walked away, so French President Francois Mitterrand, the host,
ended the photo session.
   ---&equals;
   ``Marvelous,'' President Bush said Monday. ``The Czech guys
estimated 750,000.''
   It was just an offhand comment to Dutch Prime Minister Ruud
Lubbers, but it gave voice to a heated debate among White House
officials.
   White House imagemakers are furious about press estimates of the
crowd that jammed Prague's historic Wenceslas Square to hear the
president on Saturday afternoon.
   By every account, it was a huge audience. Most press reports put
the number at more than 100,000. But White House officials, perhaps
sensitive about Bush's sagging popularity at home, were insistent
that the audience was much larger.
   White House press aides said the Secret Service estimated the
crowd at more than 1 million, but these same officials said they
really didn't believe the Secret Service number. More like 750,000,
they suggested.
   Yet, that estimate was laughed at by veteran crowd counters in
Prague, who have watched the square through a year of revolution,
demonstrations and celebrations as democracy triumphed.
   Even when political passions were at their height, the estimate
never ran above 300,000 people - and that was when the crowd stood
shoulder to shoulder in the long rectangular boulevard.
   When Bush spoke, the back of the boulevard was empty and there
was plenty of space along the sides. Shortly before Bush spoke,
Czechoslovak state television estimated the crowd at 100,000; later
it said 15,000 more people had arrived.
   Disbelieving White House officials, however, have been singling
out reporters to complain that they short-changed the president.
``An insult to the people of Czechoslovakia,'' one official fumed.
   Bush's comment to Lubbers apparently puts the argument to rest -
at least in the White House.

<TEXT>
   A 13-year-old leukemia victim whose
father waged an unsuccessful legal battle for a potentially
life-saving bone marrow transplant died today, a spokesman said.
   Jean-Pierre Bosze of suburban Hoffman Estates died this morning,
said Edward Jordan, the Bosze family attorney.
   The child's father, Tamas Bosze, sought a landmark court ruling
to force Nancy Curran - his former girlfriend and the mother of
Jean-Pierre's 3-year-old half siblings - to have the twins tested
as possible bone marrow donors.
   Curran opposed testing the twins, saying the transplant
procedure would be too painful. In September, the State Supreme
Court affirmed a lower court's ruling in favor of Curran.
   Bosze insisted the 3-year-olds would want to help their brother
if they were old enough to decide. Bosze never divorced
Jean-Pierre's mother, and had twins with Curran while the married
couple was separated.
   Jean-Pierre's doctors, meanwhile, had warned that his condition
was worsening. Bosze initially petitioned the courts in June.
   In the initial lower court ruling, Cook County Circuit Judge
Monica Reynolds held Sept. 6 that forcing the twins to take a blood
test to determine whether they could be marrow donors for
Jean-Pierre would violate their constitutional right to privacy.
   Bone marrow donations can save the lives of victims of leukemia
and other diseases if a donor with closely matching tissue types -
usually a relative - can be found. Bosze approached Curran after
tests showed that he, Jean-Pierre's mother, Jean-Pierre's brother
and another half sister were all incompatible.
   The marrow is extracted from the donor by inserting a long
needle into the hipbone or breast bone.
   A motion for the Illinois Supreme Court to reconsider its
decision was pending.

<HEAD>Kuwaiti Emir Warns Paris Summit Time Running Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The exiled emir of Kuwait sent a
message to the summit of 34 world leaders in Paris on Monday,
saying time was of paramount importance in removing Iraqi troops
from his country.
   The continuing occupation of Kuwait will eventually jeopardize
world peace and security, Sheik JAber al-AHmed al-Sabah said in the
message reported by the Kuwait News Agency.
   ``At a time when the world is laying the foundations of a new
international order based on justice, peace and detente, Iraq has
dealt a deadly blow to these principles by its occupation of an
independent state,'' said the emir.
   The 34 members of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe are meeting to discuss the shape of the world now that Cold
War divisions have ended.
   But the summit, at which the Western and Eastern military pacts
also signed a treaty relegating thousands of their weapons to the
scrap heap, has been overshadowed by the Persian Gulf crisis.
Presidents Bush and MIkhail Gorbachev, along with the other
leaders, are discussing how best to get Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Iraq's aggression has been directed at citizens of the nations
represented at the Paris gathering, said the emir, ``using them as
instruments in a humiliating exploitation of human dignity and
rights.'' President Saddam Hussein is holding hundreds of
Westerners hostage.
   ``It has thus become clear that the effects of the Iraqi
aggression have not stopped at Kuwait, but have exceeded it to hit
at the world peace and security,'' he said.
   But the Emir said he was satisfied with the ``courageous,
immediate and decisive'' stand taken by the international community
against Saddam.
   The Kuwaiti government has been residing in the Saudi Arabian
mountain resort of Taif since its members fled the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The official news agency also is operating in
exile.

   Police on Monday announced the arrest of a
59-year-old German archaeologist wanted since 1979 on charges of
stealing ancient objects.
   Police said Stefan Martin Gericke was arrested Sunday after
police found 33 ancient objects in his Athens apartment and trailer
home. Included were a prehistoric stone head, a bronze urn from the
fourth century B.C. and a wine vessel dating to about 1450 B.C. The
most recent items were from Roman times.
   Gericke refused to answer questions, a police spokesman said.
   ``Undoubtedly, he is the biggest, most dangerous and most
Ruthless antiquities thief ever to pass through Greece,'' the
spokeman said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Gericke was sentenced to 8{ years in prison for stealing
antiques in 1968 and was held for another 18 months in 1979 on
similar charges. He was released before trial and disappeared.
   ``He was able to evade arrest for so long because of his ability
to disguise himself with wigs, beards, false teeth, and so on,''
the police spokesman said.
   Police also found false identity cards and a false driver's
license and credit card in Gericke's possession, the officer said.
He said Gericke had large bank deposits in several countries,
including Switzerland, Germany, and the United States.

   Less than two weeks before national elections,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is being toasted as a statesman in Paris -
but reviled by some at home over possible tax increases.
   Opposition leaders claim Germans soon will be paying more to the
state to finance the costly merger of the two Germanys, despite the
chancellor's pledge to the contrary.
   The dispute has added some drama to an election campaign that
many had figured was decided even before it started. Polls indicate
Kohl will win a landslide victory on Dec. 2 in the first all-German
elections since 1933.
   A new poll by the ZDF television network indicated that Kohl and
his conservative party allies would win 45.5 percent of the vote
nationwide - more than enough for his Christian Democrats to form
another strong coalition with the centrist Free DEmocrats.
   ZDF said the pollsters questioned 1,000 people in former EAst
Germany and 1,000 in former West Germany at the beginning of this
month.
   Kohl's prestige has been bolstered by a continuing round of
international attention.
   He is representing the united Germany at the 34-nation summit in
Paris. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush
have each come calling at his home in the village of Oggersheim in
recent days.
   And it's been less than seven weeks since Kohl led the solemn
unification ceremonies at the stately Reichstag, as the German flag
was hoisted in the light of hundreds of glittering fireworks.
   But uncertainty over the merger costs has many Germans worried.
The West German national debt stood at $647 billion in June, even
before the East German debt was added to it.
   The euphoria over the fall of the Berlin Wall a little more than
a year ago has given way to the harsh reality of what it will cost
to overhaul the former East Germany. Some estimates have put the
Private and public costs in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
   And in a country where ordinary workers pay more than 40 percent
of their wages in taxes and other government-mandated social
benefit programs, the talk of higher taxes has many up in arms.
   Even Kohl has been talking about the possibility. He told the
Stadtsanzeiger newspaper of Cologne that Germans soon will have to
pay more ``in one area or another'' in the form of taxes or
``fees'' collected by the government.
   Kohl said he had never said there wouldn't be tax increases -
just that there wouldn't be any increases specifically to finance
German unification.
   HIs finance minister, Theo Waigel, in an interview with Der
Spiegel magazine, mentioned ``fees in the environmental area.''
Such fees, as yet not precisely spelled out, would be aimed at
cutting down on motor vehicle pollution and raising revenues for
ecological clean-up projects, among other things.
   Oskar Lafontaine of the opposition Social Democrats, the
challenger for the chancellor's job, seized on the remarks, saying
Kohl was trying to hide the costs of unification.
   ``Now the cat is out of the bag,'' he told reporters Monday.
``No one in Germany believed any more that the exploding national
debt could be tamed without taxes and fees being raised.''
   Lafontaine said he would seek a parliamentary debate on the tax
issue on Thursday.

   Demonstrators demanding the resignation
of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad staged protests in three
cities on Monday, and police and news reports said at least 40
people were hurt in clashes.
   In Dhaka, thousands of protesters marched through the streets
urging the resignation of Ershad, a 60-year-old former army general
who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982.
   Police in the port city of Chittagong said anti-government
rallies erupted in violence and at least 10 people were injured. At
least 30 people were injured in the city of Bogra, 100 miles
northwest of Dhaka, when government supporters attacked opposition
workers, United News of Bangladesh reported.
   Opposition parties say a caretaker government should replace
Ershad and hold elections within three months of its installation.
The opposition says all elections held under his Ershad government
Have been rigged.
   The president has promised to hold presidential elections next
year under the supervision of foreign observers.
   Addressing a rally of about 50,000 people in an industrial
suburb of Dhaka, Ershad accused the opposition of ``terrorism and
Destructive acts.''
   The campaign against Ershad is being led by the Awami League
party led by Sheik Hasina and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party of
Khaleda Zia. The two leaders have apparently put aside political
DIfferences for the time being to join forces in the anti-Ershad
campaign.
   The opposition has called a 24-hour strike starting at dawn
Tuesday to press for the president's resignation. The strike,
originally planned to last two days, was curtailed to allow the
army to celebrate the 19th anniversary of its founding on
Wednesday.
   On Sunday, supporters and opponents of Ershad fought each other
with crude bombs, guns and rocks. The clashes left at least 29
people injured, doctors and news reports said Monday.

   What do you do with a drunken

   The youngster woke his parents at about 7 a.m. Sunday.

   Indeed, a man was fast asleep - fully dressEd under the covers.
   The parents called police, who came to the apartment and woke
the uninvited guest. The intruder, a 22-year-old Navy man, told
police he had no idea how he'd gotten there, according to a report
in Monday's San Jose Mercury News.
   Apologetically, the sailor confessed to having had too much to
drink Saturday night. He climbed in an open window and went to bed,
thinking he was sneaking into his Moffett Field barracks about half

<HEAD>Court's Ruling Against CNN Creates Loophole For GAg Orders Against
Press</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court's handling of the
CNN-Noriega free-press dispute creates a loophole for short-lived
``gag orders'' against the news media.
   Although the court 14 years ago told judges they almost never
may bar the reporting of information already in news media hands,
Sunday's 7-2 vote left intact such a restraint against Cable News
Network.
   The high court's action, however, was not unprecedented and may
not have set any lasting rule of law.
   CNN had asked the justices to lift an order by U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler in Miami forbidding the broadcast of
conversations between Manuel Noriega, the imprisoned former
dictator of Panama, and his lawyers.
   FEderal prison authorities monitor and tape record all inmates'
telephone conversations except when told that inmates are talking
to their lawyers. But CNN reportedly has seven tapes containing
some conversations between Noriega and his defense team.
   When Noriega's lawyers rushed into court to prevent the tapes
from being broadcast, the judge ordered CNN to let him hear the
tapes so he could determine whether fair-trial rights would be
jeopardized. And the judge ruled that CNN could not broadcast the
tapes until his determination was made.
   The cable network, citing a series of Supreme Court decisions,
carried its fight to Washington rather than surrender the tapes.
Now, CNN will submit the tapes to Hoeveler and await his decision
on whether they may be broadcast.
   The ordered delay is itself a prior restraint on reporting -
something the Supreme Court in 1976 called ``the most serious and
least tolerable infringement'' of free-press rights.
   In a key 1976 ruling, the court unanimously struck down a gag
order barring the news media from publishing a Nebraska murder
defendant's confession after it was revealed in a public court
hearing.
   Two of the seven justices who voted against CNN Sunday said in
1976 they seriously doubted whether such prior restraints ever
could be valid.
   Writing for himself in the Nebraska case, Justice Byron R. White
said, ``There is grave doubt in my mind whether orders with respect
to the press such as were entered in this case would ever be
justified.''
   In the same case, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote he might rule
the press never can bE barred from reporting information it has
``no matter how shabby or illegal the means by which the
information is obtained, how serious an intrusion on privacy might
be involved, how demonstrably false the information might be, how
prejudicial it might be ... and how perverse the motivation for
publishing it.''
   Those views could indicate Sunday's vote centered on some issue
narrower than the constitutionality of Hoeveler's gag order.
   If the judge, after listening to the tapes, decides to continue
his ban, CNN could return to the high court. The justices would not
be precluded from ruling at that time that CNN's free-press rights
were violated.
   To some, such a scenario might seem contradictory. But similar
action was taken before the 1976 ruling - Justice HArry A. Blackmun
rejected an emergency request to lift the Nebraska judge's
restraining order pending the full court's decision.
   In 1971, the court ruled the government could not bar The New
York Times and The Washington Post from publishing stories based on
the so-called Pentagon papers detailing U.S. involvement in
Vietnam. But for five days the newspapers were barred by a high
court order from publishing such stories pending its decision.
   And in 1979 the justices rejected an emergency request by The
Progressive magazine, which was then under an order blocking
publication of an article the government said would help other
nations develop a hydrogen bomb.
   The high court refused to order a federal appeals court to speed
up its review of a restraining order issued by a trial judge. The
ban on publishing was in effect for more than seven months.
   Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment expert representing CNN, said
Sunday's action ``left an opening through which defense lawyers and
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles.''
   But if such tactics are allowed by lower courts, Abrams said,
the Supreme Court might intervene.
   If CNN is not allowed to broadcast its tapes, such Supreme Court
intervention may not be far off.

   A 3-year-old multiple-transplant patient
suffered a setback and was undergoing tests Monday to determine if
she is rejecting the liver and small intestines.
   Tracey Kay Gonzales of Corpus Christi, Texas, was admitted
Sunday night to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh because she had
diarrhea, said hospital spokeswoman Sue Cardillo.
   She was listed in fair condition.
   Doctors ordered a biopsy of the organs Tracey received on July
24.
   The tests will take up to two days, Ms. Cardillo said.
   ``DOctors don't know exactly what the underlying problem is,''
Ms. Cardillo said. ``Is it a virus, is it rejection or is it
another problem? It could be something as simple as a cold.''
   Despite the diarrhea, Tracey was ``up and around and being her
spunky little self,'' Ms. Cardillo said.
   Transplants of small intestines have a poor success rate. Since
1983, one adult and three children have died within a year of their
operations at Pittsburgh hospitals. ONe adult patient is still
alive.
   Tracey has been doing well and living in Pittsburgh with her
Mother, Pam, since her operation. Still, doctors are reluctant to
predict what the future may hold for her.
   ``It sounds cliche to say we are in uncharted territory, but
it's a fact,'' Ms. Cardillo said. ``You can't make long-term
predictions.''
   Tracey is taking the experimental drug FK506, which doctors say
is safer and more potent than the common anti-rejection drug
cyclosporin.
   She needed the transplant operation because she suffered from
short gut syndrome, which left her small intestine unable to absorb
nutrition. Her liver was damaged by a high-protein diet fed
intravenously.

   Butchers on Monday handed out hundreds of free
ham sandwiches in downtown Jerusalem to protest government efforts
to limit the sale of pork to appease ultra-Orthodox JEws.
   In Tel Aviv, left-wing protesters gathered in front of the Likud
party headquarters and distributed black veils to women passing by,
saying Israel was on the way to becoming a theocracy like Iran.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has promised to push the anti-pork
law and other sweeping religious legislation through Parliament in
exchange for the support of the small, ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel
Party, which joined his ruling coalition last week.
   Observant Jews are forbidden to eat pork because it is not
kosher, or permitted under Jewish dietary law.
   Shouting ``Pork! Pork!'' the butchers passed out the sandwiches
in Jerusalem's pedestrian mall, Israel radio reported.
   The protest drew angry responses from some passers-by.
   ``We are in the middle of the most religious city in the world,
and I think it's digusting that people have the gall and the nerve
to hand out ham sandwiches,'' one woman said on the radio.
   With Agudat Israel's support, Shamir now has a 64-seat majority
in the 120-seat Parliament. In the past, he governed with a
60-member coalition and a promise of support from two right-wing
Legislators.
   But Shamir's agreement to back the religious legislation has
prompted angry protests from some secular Israelis, a majority in
the nation.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, eschewing his
tax-and-spend reputation, has proposed sharp spending cuts to
eliminate a $1 billion state budget deficit even he thinks could
affect his political future.
   ``All around us there are signs of fiscal collapse,'' Cuomo said
Monday of the money problems facing New York, many other states and
the nation.
   Cuomo's plan for plugging the hole in New York's $30 billion
state budget calls for firing at least 2,000 state workers before
the end of the fiscal year on March 31 and eliminating 4,000 other
jobs through attrition and early retirement.
   Every other state worker - there are almost 250,000 - would have
to take five days off without pay by the end of the fiscal year.
Cuomo also called for reduced spending on schools and on poor
people seeking health care.
   This is the state's third straight year of budget deficits. In
the past two years, Cuomo and the Legislature have raised taxes by
almost $3 billion, including a record $1.8 billion hike earlier
this year,
   No more, Cuomo said. ``NEw taxes would damage our competitive
position in a weakening economy,'' he explained.
   ``It is obvious that the problem is national, and will need
national remedies,'' Cuomo also said. ``But we cannot wait for
Washington.''
   Cuomo, considered a potential 1992 Democratic presidential
contender, unveiled his budget plan Saturday, less than two weeks
after voters rejected his proposed $2 billion environmental bond
issue and gave him a smaller than expected re-election margin to a
third term.
   He got 53 percent of the vote, compared with a record 65 percent
in 1986 when he won a second term.
   ``They said `No taxes,'' Cuomo said of the voters.
   Cuomo, who according to recent polls is the favorite among
DEmocrats for the party's presidential nomination, has said that
unless he puts the state's fiscal house in order, there's no point
in even discussing a run for the White House.
   While Cuomo said there would be screams of protest because of
his proposed cuts, business interests praised the action.
   ``Politicians often say that government must do more with less.
Governor Cuomo's plan gives substance to that statement,'' said
Daniel Walsh, president of the Business Council of New York State.
   Cuomo, who in past years often has said government must learn
``to do more with less,'' has been frequently criticized by the
council for allowing state spending to grow at more than twice the
rate of inflation.
   ``It's a major departure from the last couple of years,''
Raymond Horton, president of the NEw York City-based Citizens
Budget Commission, a business-financed budget watchdog group, said
of Cuomo's proposals.
   LEe Miringoff, head of the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion that regularly tracks New Yorkers' sentiments about Cuomo,
said Monday that the governor may have had an eye on the national
scene when he prepared his budget plan.
   ``To some degree this could represent a political inoculation
for him,'' Miringoff said of Cuomo's call for spending cuts instead
of higher taxes.
   Nonetheless, Miringoff said Cuomo has to worry about alienating
his own core constituency - liberals, labor and minorities - as he
moves to a more fiscally conservative position.
   Miringoff noted that when Cuomo became governor in 1983, he told
New Yorkers: ``We should have only the government we need, but we
must insist on all the government we need.''
   ``He's gone with `Only the government we need,''' Miringoff said
of the latest budget plan.

   Waves washed away the U.S.
military's Marine amphibious assault on a beachhead MOnday, which
Had been intended to show Iraq a possible opening scene in a war to
free Kuwait.
   It was a glaring example of how the best laid plans can go awry
in combat.
   In this dress rehearsal, cameras were ready to roll but the
weather, which has been a key but fickle factor in wars through the
ages, decided not to cooperate for the second day in a row.
   The Marines would have gone ahead with a landing Sunday in a
real war, but it wasn't worth the risk to life and equipment in
peacetime, said Maj. Gen. Harry W. Jenkins Jr., commander of the
Marine Expeditionary Brigade.
   Footage of U.S. Marines storming a Saudi beach was supposed to
be the visual centerpiece of the first joint U.S.-Saudi military
exercise, named Imminent Thunder.
   In the broader combat exercise that ends Wednesday, the washout
was relatively insignificant. But in the high-stakes game of
psychological warfare, it was something of a dud.
   BEfore Sunday's attempted assault, Marine Maj. John Toolan said
he spoke to his troops about ``the fourth dimension of warfare,''
How the media helps spread the message about the power of the U.S.
armed forces.
   ``When Saddam Hussein sees the Marines and Navy working so well
together, we'll make more money without ever firing a shot,'' he
said.
craft skim over the water at 50 mph because 14-foot waves and high
wind made them difficult to launch.
   The American public, and undoubtedly some Iraqis, did get to see
helicopter-borne Saudi and U.S. troops land on the beach Sunday and
join Saudi and U.S. ground forces.
   A rendezvous Sunday between Saudi marines and a company of the
Marine's 3rd Light Armored Infantry marked the first time a regular
U.S. Marine unit was allowed close to the Kuwaiti border.
   ``This is the first time that any of us have been this far
north,'' said another Marine officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``Our objective is to locate the enemy, find gaps in his
defenses and report back,'' said the battalion executive officer,
Maj. Jeff Powers, 35, of Ridgefield, N.J.
   On Monday, the Marines participated in a simulated armored
attack. For the most part, Marine officers said they were satisfied
the invading Iraqi tanks would have been spotted and destroyed,
although one unit briefly slipped past the defending force. No live
ammunition or blanks were fired.
   The exercise was repeated later Monday to give aircraft a chance
to spot the invading tanks and direct imaginary fire. The 1,100
U.S., British and French combat aircraft taking part in Imminent
Thunder represent the largest use of aircraft in a training
exercise since the multinational deployment.
   Jenkins said Sunday the mock aerial attacks were a success. But
there was no media pool coverage of the aerial operation and it was
impossible to assess from the groundconfusing and everybody needs to understand
that,'' Brig. Gen. Mike Myatt, commander of Marine ground forces,
said in a recent interview. ``We've trained Marine officers to deal
with uncertainty. If you're used to having 100 percent of
information before you act, you'll be defeated.''
   Edward Foster, a researcher with the London-based Royal United
Services Institute for Defense Studies, said any exercise requires
flexibility.
   The biggest amphibious landing ever undertaken, the D-Day
landing on the Normandy coast on June 6, 1944, ``went ahead 24
hours later than planned because of the weather,'' he said.

   One Big Mac, hold the dressing.
   McDonald's workers trying to handle a noon-hour rush were
confused when they started getting orders for pink teddies and
black brassieres instead of Big Macs and fries.
   A glitch sent chatter from an emcee at a nightclub holding a
lingerie ``fashion show'' Friday to the headsets worn by workers at
the McDonald's next door.
   Confused order-takers at McDonald's heard the solicitations at
Ziegfield's Restaurant and Bar.
   ``Gentlemen, you can invite the lovely models over to your table
to investigate the quality of this sexy lingerie. I think it's
perfectly OK to let those ladies know - with a little financial
endeavor - if you would like to have them come over,'' the emcee
said.
   Ziegfield's had been closed since August after a Johnson County
district judge ruled its erotic dancing shows violated a city
zoning ordinance that prohibits live entertainment in the area of
the Kansas City suburb.
   But it reopened Friday, saying it now would offer a ``fashion
show'' featuring ``girls, girls, girls'' in lingerie and bathing
suits.
   Dan Eckman, the McDonald's owner, made a quick call to
Ziegfield's and the problem was solved when the emcee moved to
another microphone.
   But Ziegfield's problems didn't end there. A few hours after the
show started, police arrived and closed it again. Police handed out
13 citations, 12 for allegedly violating a zoning ordinance and one

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, refusing to
endorse the use of military force against Iraq, said today, ``We
All need patience'' in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Gorbachev made the statement as he began a meeting with
President Bush during a 34-nation summit. It appears to dash U.S.
hopes for winning immediate Soviet support for a United Nations
resolution authorizing military action to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Asked whether he would endorse such a resolution, Gorbachev
said, ``Well, I think we all need patience. But that does not mean
that we are going to relax, that we are going to retreat.''
   Bush tried to deflect questions, saying he was looking forward
to their talks and a dinner tonight.
   ``I'm very pleased with the way the Soviet Union and the United
States can work together in the United Nations. There continues to
be very open-minded communications and I have no reason to be
anything other than very satisfied,'' Bush said.
   Gorbachev told reporters, ``I think you must know we're not
going to change our position. We certainly seek to resolve that
situation and we must be firm in our position.''
   As their meeting began at the U.S. Embassy residence, the lights
in the building went dark. The room was lit by the lights of a
camera team positioned in the room until the power returned several
minutes later.
   The two leaders had been scheduled to hold a news conference at
the conclusion of tonight's talks, but that session was canceled
without explanation.
   Earlier in the day, Bush said he would be willing to provide
emergency food supplies and humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union,
saying, ``I worry about the Soviet people during the bleak winter
coming up.''
   Bush made his suggestion in advance of a two-hour meeting
tonight with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose country
is reeling under political and economic turmoil.
   The crisis in the Persian Gulf also was high on the agenda for
their talks. GOrbachev appears far more reluctant than Bush to use
military force to get Iraq out of Kuwait, insisting that diplomacy
and an economic embargo against Baghdad be given more time to work.
   In his earlier comments, Bush said Gorbachev ``has been very
solid in support of the United Nations'' and the resolutions
approved by the Security Council to squeeze Iraq with financial
pressure.
   Asked about Gorbachev's confidence that the gulf crisis can be
resolved peacefully, Bush said, ``I'm anxious to know if there's
something new that he's thinking of, but I can't think what it
Is.''
   Over the past month, Gorbachev has been touring EUropean
capitals in search of financial and moral support for his embattled
program of reforms.
   Secretary of State James BAker said Sunday the United States had
not been asked for food or money. But U.S. officials said last week
they were preparing contingency plans in case of a Soviet request.
   Bush, during a morning news conference with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, appeared sympathetic to the plight of
America's onetime chief adversary.
   ``We would always be open-minded on humanitarian aid if there's
a real need there,'' Bush said.
   Although U.S. law limits direct economic assistance to Moscow,
Bush said the United States could help alleviate food shortages,
For example.
   ``And that's the right and humane thing to do as a country moves
towards us and relations are greatly improved. ANd I would want to
try to help,'' he said.
   Food rationing will begin next month in Leningrad, the country's
second largest city. Some smaller cities have been rationing for
more than a year. In Moscow, some items such as sugar are
restricted. The city council is debating whether to issue coupon
booklets.
   ``I worry about the Soviet people during the bleak winter coming
up if ... it proves to be as severe as some of the reports
indicate,'' Bush said.
   He said, ``We want to try to help with the evolution of market
systems and the evolution - the change that's taking place. And you
also want to help new friends when you find them - if they're in
jeopardy.''

   More than 5,000 Vietnamese boat people staged a
peaceful sit-in at a detention center Monday as the High Court
began reviewing the government's policy of screening refugees.
   GOrdon Tam of the Correctional Services Department said the
Vietnamese outside the suburban Whitehead detention center chanted
slogans decrying forced repatriation and carried banners saying
they would rather die than go back to Vietnam.
   The protesters also said they opposed a new agreement reached in
September by the U.N High Commissioner for Refugees, Britain and
Vietnam under which Hanoi has agreed to accept boat people who do
not object to returning.
   The U.N. agency has said it knows of more than 100 Vietnamese
who do not object to returning home. Radio Hong Kong said the first
such returnees are expected to head for Vietnam NOv. 29.
   Tam said no trouble was reported during the hourlong
demonstration at Whitehead, which houses 24,000 Vietnamese boat
people. He declined to say if the protest was directly linked to
Monday's High Court review of the cases of nine Vietnamese
refugees.
   The eight men and one woman are challenging the government's
policy of screening refugees. Under the 2-year-old policy,
Vietnamese who cannot prove they fled Vietnam because of religious
or political persecution face repatriation.
   Daniel Fung, lawyer for the nine, said immigration officers
responsible for screening refugees were intolerant, impatient and
ignorant. He argued the screening process was flawed and said all
nine should be granted refugee status.
   There are now some 54,000 VIetnamese in Hong Kong. ONly about
8,000 of them arrived before the screening policy was introduced.

   Violations of federal safety regulations cost
railroads and freight shippers more than $8.3 million in civil
penalties during a recent 12-month period, the FEderal Railroad
Administration said Monday.
   The penalties, the highest in a decade, included $3.2 million
collected for violating regulations on the shipment of hazardous
materials. They were assessed during the 1990 fiscal year which
ended on Sept. 30.
   The railroad administration imposes civil penalties as a means
of making management more aware of threats to rail safety,
according to administrator Gil Carmichael.
   He said this approach has been effective, leading to significant
safety improvements since 1978.
   The railroad administrator said these include:
   -A 73 percent decline in train accidents.
   -A 60 percent decline in hazardous material releases.
   -A 63 percent decline in on-duty employee injuries.
   -A 60 percent decline in on-duty employee fatalities.
   The agency also said that since 1978 the rate of train accidents
per million miles has decreased from 15 to 4.96, a two-thirds
reduction.
   The penalties were assessed for violations including those
Involving track, locomotives, freight cars, signals and operating
practices.

<HEAD>Ten Deaths A Day Reported in Political Unrest This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TINA SUSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An average of 10 people have
died each day this year in political violence, making 1990 the
deadliest year in South Africa since widespread unrest erupted six
years ago, researchers said MOnday.
   In a sign of the increasing bloodshed, the bodies of 19 men who
had been hacked and shot were found scattered across a field in a
black township Monday. Police said they did not know the motive for
the slayings.
   Twenty-one other people died in unrest-related attacks over the
weekend, including two white police officers and a black man
ambushed in a township on the east coast Monday, officials said.
   The independent South African Institute of Race Relations said
3,038 people had been killed in political unrest since January 1,
or about 10 each day. That was about three times the daily death
rate for the same period last year, the institute said.
   ``1990 alone already accounts for more than a third of all the
people killed in political violence over this six-year period''
since September 1984, the report said.
   Rioting broke out Sept. 3, 1984, in black townships near
Johannesburg during a work stoppage to protest rent increases. THe
unrest spread to other areas of the country as blacks began rising
up against apartheid policies.
   Unlike the early years of racial unrest, when security forces
caused most deaths, today's victims are usually blacks killed by
other blacks, the institute said.
   It said the spillover of black factional fighting from Natal
Province to the Johannesburg area accounted for much of the 1990
increase in deaths.
   Since August, more than 800 blacks have died in the townships
around Johannesburg. Most were victims of clashes between the
African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party.
   Both groups oppose apartheid but differ on methods for fighting
it and on their vision for a future South Africa.
   Some township residents said Zonkwezizwe, outside Johannesburg,
had been hit by factional unrest, but the motive for the slayings
of the 19 men found there Monday was unclear.
   Police said there was no report of fighting in Zonkwezizwe
during the weekend, and patrols did not detect any trouble Sunday
night, when the slayings apparently occurred.
   The bodies were in a field about 80 yards from the nearest
houses. Heavily armed patrols moved into the township Monday to
prevent further unrest.
   Also Monday, police announced they had detained six people,
including three British subjects, in connection with an explosion
near a black taxi stand in Pretoria on Aug. 11.
   The explosion injured a dozen people. There have been a series
of bomb attacks in South African cities in recent months, and
police have blamed most of them on right-wing extremists opposed to
President F.W. de Klerk's racial reforms.

   The foreign ministers of the three Baltic republics
were barred entry Monday to the 34-nation European summit,
apparently because of Soviet objections.
   The ministers from the breakaway Soviet republics of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia had been in Paris since Thursday, lobbying for a
formal role in the three-day Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe.
   They reported receiving encouragement from several participating
countries, including the United STates, to attend either as
official observers or as ``special guests'' of France.
   On Monday, the World Federation of Free Latvians said that
France had withdrawn its invitation because of Soviet objections.
Under the ground rules of the conference, all decisions must be
made by consensus, and one nation can in effect veto actions
supported by other participants.
   According to the federation, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze protested the FRench invitation and said the Baltic
officials could participate as part of the Soviet delegation if
they wished.
   Daniel Bernard, spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry,
confirmed that the Baltic officials had been told they could not
participate in the summit because of the consensus rule. He
declined to discuss the Soviet role in the matter.
   The three Baltic officials were Lennart Meri of Estonia,
Algirdas Saudargas of Lithuania, and Janis Jurkans of Latvia.

   In the process, however, we must bear in mind that Europe is
only a part of the world, a world whose destinies are shaped not
only here but beyond the boundaries of our continent in places
where the winds of change are also making themselves felt. The
world's overriding objective is building a more secure and
civilized world so that instead of military force our world order
would be based on equitable dialogue, on a balance of interest, and
on the ability to find a consistent path between sovereignty and
the integrity of the human race where it stands today.
   Concern over the survival of the human race is no longer
centered almost exclusively on removing the threat of nuclear war,
as it was only a short time ago, but it is increasingly focused on
non-military global problems, among them the environment, energy,
food and water supplies, social ills, crime, mass poverty, foreign
debt, and so on. What is particularly remarkable is the developing
international solidarity that is emerging as we tackle all these
problems. However, we would be succumbing to impermissible euphoria
should we conclude that by achieving the great accomplishment, that
having virtually eliminated the threat of a major war in Europe, we
thought that we totally ruled out the possibility of conflict in
the continent.
   At the moment, each country is in the process of a vigorous
search for the place it could occupy in a future system. This
search can be productive only if we remain aware of two major
realities in our world. Namely, that multivalent social and
political development is not only inevitable, but it's also
fruitful, and that this cannot be ignored without rendering
meaningless the principle of freedom of choice, because we all need
and value the partnership and mutual accommodation that are
incompatible with nationalistic selfishness, or parochial
isolationism.
   Failure to take into account that multivalent or polyphonic
aspect of advancement, or any attempt to impose any particular way
of life on someone else as a precondition to be met before
cooperation is envisaged, abound to breed suspicion, mistrust,
militant nationalism and reckless separatism. That way like
conflicts - animosity, the Balkanization or even worse, the
Lebanization of entire regions, either of which would slow down the
establishment of a shared Europe so essential to the European
process.
   THerefore, it would seem desirable immediately after the Paris
meeting to proceed to the establishment of structures and
institutions that would be truly capable of shaping the economic,
environmental and technological foundation for a new Europe. This
would offer the only truly democratic chance of exerting a positive
influence on internal developments in a number of countries and
protecting them from dangerous outbreaks of nationalism and
separatism.
   The claims to territorial changes that result from nationalism
and separatism would seem particularly unacceptable, for once the
process has begun, it may train a destructive snowball effect that
would throw Europe back into the kind of situation which it knows
only too well from its own history.
   While developing into a system of states, Europe remains a
continent of countries and nations that are open to cooperation
with one another in a variety of ways. These two factors balance
each other, making for stability in these new conditions.
   THe notion of a European space covers more than the territory
from the Atlantic to the Urals. It includes the Soviet Union as far
as the Pacific, as well as the United States and Canada,
inseparably linked as they are with the Old World by the bonds of
common history. If the European process gains the necessary
momentum, each nation will be able to rely in the foreseeable
future, if we pool our assets, on the potential for an
unprecedentedly powerful community of nations, spanning almost the
whole of the upper part of the globe.
structures, the first outline for a European home? We favor an
active and prompt continuation of the Vienna negotiations, with the
participation of all 34 states, which alongside further cuts in
their armed forces and changes in the structure of these could
proceed to the elaboration of new and comprehensive confidence
building measures.
   It would be desirable to combine in the Vienna II framework the
two negotiating components of the first phase. It's time we
broadened their agenda through inclusion of other types of weapons,
above all else naval armaments.
   Of course, the political and psychological changes we have noted
and welcomed have brought to the fore the issue of tactical nuclear
weapons in Europe. We would be prepared to start negotiations on
that subject within another month or two. Our proposal jointly to
give some thought to the concept of what exactly we mean by minimal
deterrence, and where to draw the line beyond which nuclear
retaliatory capability may develop into an offensive capability, is
indicative of our willingness to proceed gradually towards the
elimination of that capability, without overdramatizing existing
differences of opinion on the role of nuclear weapons per se.
   We are also prepared promptly to set about substantive
discussions of the open skies issue.
   The situation of Europe is in transience. It will apparently
take some time before we're able to grasp all the changes taking
place in our day. But what counts is our shared understanding that
it must be a time of peaceful change. That is why starting work on
institutionalizing the European process would be one of the major
practical results to stem from this meeting.

   The man, who was not immediately identified, was pronounced dead
at the scene, a District of Columbia Fire Department spokesman
said. The incident occurred on the West Front of the Capitol,
facing the Mall that stretches from the Capitol to the Lincoln
Memorial.
   It happened shortly before 2 p.m. EST, according to fire
department spokesman Capt. Ted Holmes.
   Officer Dan Nichols of the Capitol police said the man used
``some kind of accelerant'' to feed the flames.
   There was no immediate indication that the incident was
connected to any political cause, said Nichols.
   Congress is not in session, reducing the amount of activity
around the building.
   A tourist from Iowa who was coming out of the Capitol when the
fire occurred said she saw black smoke and the man ablaze.
   ``He stood for quite a while,'' said the woman, who declined to
give her name. ``A lot of people were watching. ... He laid down
and was reaching out of the fire.''
   Nichols said the man was burned too badly to identify by race or
age. He said police made a sweep of the area with canine teams and
were looking for something that would identify the victim.

<HEAD>PARIS: this meeting.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Among the trailblazing decisions to set up a three-tier
mechanism, I would wish to single out the conflict prevention
center designed to provide settlements, as it were, for
political-military situations that might arise. We find it highly
promising as it may gradually develop into a kind of all-European
Security Council that would have effective means to extinguish the
sparks of any possible conflict.
   The two years between now and Helsinki II will be a trial period
to test the unprecedented mechanism for European interactions to be
set in motion here in Paris. Understanding an agreement on the role
played by the United States and the Soviet Union appear to be of
the greatest importance during the transitional period. No matter
what difficulties the Soviet Union may face today, it will remain a
great world and European factor, playing an innovative and
stabilizing role in line with its huge potential.
   On the subject of the military alliances, the Warsaw Treaty
Organization and NATO; the Warsaw Treaty member countries are
likely to take important decisions before the end of this year on
transforming the organization and changing its character. It is, of
course, for the NATO member countries to take any NATO related
decisions. Hopefully, the transformation of the alliance as already
announced will assume a bolder attitude in taking stock of the
profound and apparently irreversible changes underway in Europe.
   The outcome of the decisions we're about to take here will to a
great extent depend on the attitude and activity of existing
international structure, which has proved effective and gained
useful - (inaudible) - I'm referring here to the European
Community, the Council of Europe, European parliamentary
institutions, Western European and international economic
organizations, non-government research and information centers, and
of course inter-party and inter-labor associations.
   Both their ability to adapt in new developments and also the
willingness and ability to cooperate with them of non-members
constitutes a highly complex issue that needs time before it can be
properly tackled, particularly in the light of the huge gap in the
social, economic legacy of the various European countries and the
critical situation prevalent in many of them today.
Formulated imperative of solidarity is what we need and what this
forum, convened in the interest of all of Europe, urges on those
who will take part in the all-European process covering the areas
I've outlined about. Profound changes in the Soviet Union will
increasingly generate the necessary preconditions for rapprochement
with the European Community
   I should also add that the arch of cooperation we're beginning
to develop around the Northern hemisphere would be inconceivable
without developing new relationships between the SOviet Union and
Japan.
   ANd finally a word on yet another subject, which is not on our
agenda. Iraq's aggressions have become the second serious test as
we begin our movements towards a new period of peace in history.
   Our unity in condemning it and our shared concern over the
outcome of the crisis are also indicative of the radical shift in
our midst and the perception of the goals of and the meanings
available to world politics. Any armed attack, wherever it may
occur, now serves to unite us rather than scatter us on different
sides of the barricade.
   Demanding that the aggressor withdraw from Kuwait, we are
defending the hopes that millions of people have begun to pin on
the ability of the international community to cope with even the
most critical of conflicts. If we disappoint these hopes, much of
what we have accomplished in the past few years would be in
Jeopardy. We're prepared to show patience in the quest for a
political solution, but we will remain firm and determined in
implementing the will of the United Nations.
   Ladies and gentlemen, the peoples of Europe, the United States
and Canada have resolved to create a common historical entity,
based on shared principles and purposes, on democracy and humanism.
May I congratulate you, therefore, on that major first step, and
wish you all success. The revival of the spirit of international
solidarity that was kindled during the war and that inspired the
founders of the United Nations raises the hope that what we then
conceived of will ultimately prevail.
   And it is most important for the United Nations and its Security
Council to take up at long last the purpose for which they were
originally designed, and I would like to welcome in our midst the
most distinguished guest, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, who has done so
much to revive the role of the United Nations.
   I would also like to express our gratitude to the leaders of
France and personally to President Francois Mitterrand for their
warmth and hospitality, as well as their excellent preparations for
this meeting. Thank you.

   were barred entry Monday to the 34-nation European summit,
apparently because of Soviet objections.
   The ministers from the breakaway Soviet republics of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia had been in Paris since Thursday, lobbying for a
formal role in the three-day Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe.
   They reported receiving encouragement from several participating
countries, including the United States, to attend either as
official observers or as ``special guests'' of France.
France had withdrawn its invitation because of Soviet objections.
Under the ground rules of the conference, all decisions must be
made by consensus, and one nation can in effect veto actions
supported by other participants.
   According to the federation, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze protested the French invitation and said the Baltic
officials could participate as part of the Soviet delegation if
they wished.
   Daniel Bernard, spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry,
confirmed that the Baltic officials had been told they could not
participate in the summit because of the consensus rule. He
declined to discuss the Soviet role in the matter.
   The three Baltic officials were Lennart Meri of Estonia,
Algirdas Saudargas of Lithuania, and Janis Jurkans of Latvia.

<HEAD>Bates College Makes All Admissions Testing Optional</HEAD>

   submit any standardized test scores for admission.
   BAtes, a small liberal arts college in Lewiston, Maine, thus
became only the second highly-selective college in the nation with
no standardized admissions test requirements. The other, Bowdoin,
is also a small liberal arts college in Maine.
   Bates made the SAT optional in 1984. But entering freshmen who
didn't submit SAT scores had to submit either three achievement
test scores or the American College Test, or ACT.
   Bates' faculty earlier this month voted 94-1 to make all
admissions testing optional, admissions dean William C. Hiss said
in a telephone interview Monday. Starting with freshmen entering in
September 1991, applicants can choose whether to submit any test
scores.
   In a statement Monday, The College Board, which sponsors the SAT
and numerous standardized achievement tests, called BAtes' decision
``curious'' in light of the ``emphasis being placed on subject
matter knowledge in college admissions discussions.''
   About a hundred colleges have made SAT and ACT scores optional
for admission, according to FairTest, a Cambridge, Mass.-based
organization that keeps tabs on those requirements. But many of
those recommend taking those tests, or else require them for
placement purposes. Some require applicants to take achievement
tests in lieu of SATs.
   But a five-year study at Bates found that the optional SAT
policy had no negative impact on the quality of its entering
freshman, and in fact had improved the student mix, Hiss said.
   Minority enrollments increased from 5 percent to 10 percent,
Hiss said. The optional testing policy also has helped the school
attract bright students who can't afford SAT coaching courses, as
well as bright youngsters whose minds aren't geared to standardized
test-taking, Hiss said.
   He cited the case of a valedictorian from a rural Maine high
school who nonetheless had poor verbal SATs and might have been
rejected if Bates put a premium on test scores.
   ``The thing you had to know about this boy was that he was the
nation's youngest Emergency Medical Service instructor at age 16.
What does this tell you about his ability to think through
complicated scientific questions and supervise people twice his
age? As an applicant, I thought he looked just great for Bates.
That's why we're doing this.''

   A naked man strategically covered with straw
peers out from the cover of Playgirl magazine on a rack outside the
city's granite-pillared cultural center.
   But whatever culture Rick Graff's ramshackle newsstand offers is
lost on city officials, who are evicting it after more than 70
years of business.
   You can't miss the place loyal customers call a landmark - a
peeling grey-painted wood shack packed with thousands of
publications ranging from Good Housekeeping to Revolutionary
Worker.
   Graff says it's one of the nation's largest newsstands. Dozens
of metal stands filled with magazines spill out onto the sidewalk.
Magazines with more revealing covers than Playgirl are partially
hidden behind a rickety wall inside the shack.
   Wearing dark glasses that prompt chuckles from passers-by,
Graff's two dogs - an Alaskan malamute named Tasha and Rocky the
shepherd-huskie - lie vigilantly on a soiled reddish carpet between
the shack and the cultural center's steps.
   ``It's not very attractive,'' Commissioner Benjamin Reyes ofthe
city's general services department said Monday. He sent Graff an
eviction notice last week.
   ``The primary reason is the stand has no legal permit to operate
out of that location,'' Reyes said.
   GRaff said permits were not needed when the stand opened more
than 70 years ago. And even if he sought one now, ``We would not
authorize any permits for vendors operating around one of our
facilities,'' Reyes said.
   The policy is part of the city's new beautification effort, and
Graff is not being singled out, the commissioner said.
   But Graff, 28, maintains the eviction is an effort to stifle the
working class.
   ``They want to make this a party palace for the rich,'' Graff
said, motioning toward the renovated block-long cultural center
where lectures, poetry readings and art exhibits are held.
   Reyes said the city offered to lease a store to Graff in a
nearby underground pedestrian mall, but Graff - who bought the
stand for $50,000 seven years ago and pays no rent - said no dice.
   The city rejected his proposal to build a spiffier stand on the
site, and Graff contends moving it would destroy the stand's major
selling points - its unique atmosphere and strategic location
between a commuter train station and the downtown subway and
elevated train tracks.
   ``It's not only a great newsstand, but a family can come here
and actually have fun. There's comics for kids, hundreds of
magazines, and people can come here and pet my dogs,'' Graff said,
   ``You're not going to close down, are you?'' William Brady, a
36-year-old janitor, asked as he bought a paper. ``I don't think
it's an eyesore, it's a landmark.''
   Reyes said the case is closed, but Graff is seeking an attorney
to fight the eviction.
   He doesn't have much time; the eviction orders him to leave by
January 14.
   ``I sure would hate to see it go,'' said Shirley Goldman, a
retired teacher who remembers shopping at the stand 30 years ago.
``It's real memorabilia.''

<HEAD>Fannie Mae Raises Ceiling on Mortgages It Will Buy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slightly cheaper mortgages will be available
to more home buyers next year because of an increase in the size of
single-family-home loans purchased by secondary market agencies.
   The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) said
Monday it will purchase mortgages as large as $191,250 starting
Jan. 1, up from a $187,450 ceiling this year. In Alaska and Hawaii,
the ceiling will be 50 percent higher.
   The board of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac)
is expected to approve a similar increase when it meets in early
December, spokeswoman Audra Capas said.
   Together, the two stockholder-owned but
congressionally-chartered companies finance one in four of the
nation's residential mortgages. They purchase mortgages from
lenders, holding some and repackaging others into securities for
sale to investors.
   Lenders are able to charge interest rates a quarter- to a
half-point lower on mortgages they sell to the companies compared
with loans they retain in their own portfolios.
   The ceiling increase won't mean much in most regions, but in
high-cost areas such as California the Northeast, where the average
mortgage is near the limit, it will help buyers a bit.
   A home buyer with a mortgage at the new ceiling would save $73 a
month with a fixed-rate loan of 9{ percent, instead of 10 percent,
for instance.
   Two-family-home residential mortgages will have a limit of
$244,650; three-family, $295,650, and four-family, $367,500.
   ``The practical effect of this is positive,'' said James W.
Nelson, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
He estimated that the higher limits will enable roughly 25,000
families to take advantage of slightly lower mortgage rates.
   ``In the Midwest and West, markets have tended to be a little
stronger than elsewhere and, as housing prices go up, it helps make
financing more available for a certain segment of the home-buying
public,'' he said.
   The new single-family ceiling is based on data collected by the
Federal Housing Finance Board, which said Monday that the average
sales price for a single-family home was $139,600 in October, up 2
percent from $136,800 a year earlier. The loan ceilings increase
proportionately.
   Through the 1980s, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ceilings have
risen rapidly along with housing prices, falling for the first time
in 1990. The single-family ceiling was $187,450 in 1990, $187,600
in 1989, $168,700 in 1988, $153,100 in 1987, $133,250 in 1986 and
$115,000 in 1985.

   Nationalists appeared headed for
victory over Communists in Bosnia-Hercegovina's first free
elections in more than a half-century, according to returns made
public Monday.
   The Serbian Democratic Alliance, the Croatian Democratic Union,
and the Moslem Union for Democratic Action were running well ahead
of the Communist Party and federal Premier Ante Markovic's ALliance
of Reform Forces.
   With 20 percent of the vote counted in the central republic, the
Moslem party was leading in three Bosnian constituencies. The
Croats and the Serbs were ahead in two each.
   The 240 seats in Bosnia's bicameral Parliament are divided among
seven constituencies. Final results were not expected for several
days, and no single nationalist party seemed likely to win a clear
majority.
   At a news conference, leaders of the Serbian, Croatian and
Moslem parties said they would cooperate on major political and
Economic issues.
   Moslem party leader Alija Izetbegovic suggested the three
parties form a government coalition.
   ``I'm delighted that Bosnia is finally free and that we can
start working for the benefit of all nationalities living in the
region,'' said Stjepan Kljujic, leader of the Croatian Democratic
Union.
   ``The communists were rejected in Bosnia's elections because of
the disastrous consequences of their 45 years of monopoly on
power,'' said Radovan Karadzic, president of the Serbian Democratic
Alliance. ``This is a victory for democracy.''
   Zlatko Lajundzia, a member of the Communist Party's presidium,
said, ``It is obvious that the nationalist parties are doing much
better than we and they had expected.''
supporters well ahead. The two parties had claimed victory for a
nationalist party could lead to civil war.
   Western observers said the elections, in which about 70 percent
of the electorate cast ballots Sunday, were free and generally
fair. It was the region's first free elections since 1938.
   ``Except for some isolated incidences, in general the elections
seem to have been carried out fairly,'' said David Evans, a senior
adviser for a U.S. congressional commission monitoring human rights
and security in Europe.
   Bosnia-HErcegovina, whose 4.2 million people include Serbs,
Croats and Moslems, is geographically and politically at the heart
of Yugoslavia's bitter rivalries.
   Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital, is best known for the assassination
of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a young nationalist
in 1914. His killing sparked World War I.
   Serbia and Croatia are the two largest Yugoslav republics, and
they flank Bosnia-HErcegovina. They have previously made
territorial claims on the central republic.
   Serbia, under Communist rule pending elections Dec. 9, wants to
keep power centralized in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal
capital. Croatia, where the Croatian Democratic Union defeated the
Communists in spring elections, wants Yugoslavia to become a
confederation of nearly independent states.
   Bosnia has so far steered a neutral and independent course.
Catholic Croats and the Orthodox Serbs since Yugoslavia was founded
as a kingdom in 1918. During the Nazi occupation of World War II,
Bosnia was the scene of a civil war among Croats, Serbs, Communists
and the occupying Germans.

<NOTE>Eds: Combines pvs, minor editing, adds nationality and ages.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The band Milli Vanilli was stripped of its
Grammy award today because the pop duo didn't sing on the ``Girl
You Know It's True'' album, Grammy officials announced.
   The group won the Grammy for best new artist last February.
   The Grammy was rescinded by a telephone vote of the trustees of
the NAtional Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, which gives out
the music industry awards. It wasn't known if the award will be
given to another artist.
   ``This action comes as a result of admissions and revelations by
Milli Vanilli's producer, record label and the two performers Rob
Pilatus and Fab Morvan that the label credit on their album... was
incorrect,'' the academy said in a statement issued from its
Burbank headquarters.
   Pilatus and Morvan said during the weekend they wanted to give
up the Grammy and return it to the artists that actually sang on
their hit album. The had planned to forfeit the Grammy during a
Tuesday news conference.
   ``Fabrice and I want to give the Grammy back to the real
singers,'' Pilatus told the Los Angeles Times.
   The lip-sync controversy erupted last week when Milli Vanilli's
German producer, Frank Farian, disclosed that others actually sang
on the record credited to Pilatus and Morvan. The duo also
lip-synced their way through live performances, including one at
the Grammy Awards show, Farian said.
   The duo's first and only album, ``Girl You Know It's True,''
sold 7 million copies and helped Milli Vanilli garner the Grammy.
   Music industry leaders were embarrassed and stunned by the
deception.
   ``It was fraud and we're appalled by it,'' said Michael Greene,
academy president.
   Pilatus and Morvan said Saturday they hoped their forfeited
Grammy would be given to vocalists Johnny Davis, Charles Shaw and
Brad Howell, who reportedly sang on the record.
   Pilatus is from Germany and Morva is from the Caribbean island
of Guadeloupe. Both are 25.
   The two front men have alleged that Arista Records, the label
that distributed ``Girl You Know It's True'' in the United States,
knew they weren't really the singers.
   However, Arista officials have maintained that Pilatus and
Morvan told them they sang on the album.

   Here are excerpts of Monday's testimony by
Sen. Dennis DeConcini before the Senate Ethics Committee:
   ``All of the evidence that has been admitted, as I understand
now that lies over there - some 44 volumes. ... This information
contains heresay. ... It contains rumors, unfounded allegations
about all the senators, I dare say. ...
   ``Now, Mr. Chairman, I regret that I have to mention and make
reference to Mr. Bennett (special counsel Robert S. Bennett)
because of the manner in which he presented the case Thursday and
Friday. ... HE wants a victory. He wants to nail somebody. He wants
to get somebody, I'm sorry to say. HE wants another trophy on the
wall. ...
   ``But it has been said many times, this is not a trial. This is
supposed to be a fact-finding hearing where we get an opportunity
to lay our case out for you and the AMerican public. ...
   ``Constituent service to me is very important. ... And when a
constituent, someone from Arizona, walks in to my office, we have
no discrimination, whether they are Republican, Democrat, liberal,
conservative, rich, poor, even if they are not registered voters.
If they've got a complaint, we listen to them. ...
   ``What is wrong with intervention from someone who sends you a
check to your campaign? Nothing - no more different than what is
wrong when American Continental or their employees sent checks to
our campaigns. They didn't hand the checks to us and talk about it.
   ``We've handled 75,000 constituent cases in the 14 years that I
have been a senator. And we haven't discriminated, and we don't
talk money with them. ...
   ``Now, let me talk about the case of American Continental and
Lincoln. They came to me, as they did to other people, argued their

said to them, `Give me some evidence.' ... So what did they do?
They got me some pretty powerful evidence - all us - pretty
powerful evidence. ...
   I decided to intervene. That's right. I got in there, with my
sleeves up, and decided to go for it. ...
   All the regulators pointed out ... we did nothing improper. ...
There was no change made by what we attempted to persuade them to
do, or bring to their attention. ... We didn't do anything wrong in
any meetings. We acted as senators should have. They weren't
intimidated until a couple of years later, when they got darn
worried that they hadn't done their jobs. ...
   I was asked to make a status inquiry and I did. There were jobs
involved. This was a major employer. ...
   I've had to say some things that are difficult to say about a
brother lawyer, a fine prosecutor as far as I know, by reputation.
But I've been mistreated by him in this process. ...
   To do other than dismiss the charges against me is unjust. I
broke no law. I broke no rule. I broke no standard. I committed no
improper conduct. ...

   Lech Walesa, exuding confidence six days
before the country's first popular presidential election, declared
MOnday that he was ``borN only for victory.''
   The Solidarity chairman, ahead in the polls against his former
ally Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and four others, said his
struggle has already been successful, because it has forced an
acceleration of change in Poland.
   The 47-year-old electrician from Gdansk rose to international
prominence more than a decade ago when he led the trade-union
movement that sparked enormous political changes in Poland.
   The Solidarity movement also helped spark revolutions elsewhere
in Eastern Europe that ended decades of Communist rule. But now the
movement is splintered.
   Walesa, in an interview with The Associated Press, said one of
his first moves as president would be to try to unite Solidarity
again. But he said he would avoid abrupt changes until postwar
Poland's first free parliamentary elections, expected within three
months.
   Mazowiecki contends Poland's future depends on maintaining his
course of determined but cautious reform, and that he will join the
opposition if Walesa wins the presidency on Sunday or in a Dec. 9
runoff.
   Walesa has waged a pugnacious campaign against a government he
largely created. He proposed Mazowiecki as the East bloc's first
non-Communist prime minister in August 1989, and then found himself
on the sidelines, chafing at what he saw as a too-slow pace of
reforms.
   ``THen, when I said, `I'll take over power, I'll become
president,' everything started moving,'' he said. ``SO didn't I
accelerate everything?''
   He launched his presidential campaign, initially criticized but
then leading to former Communist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski's
decision to step down early as president.
dangerous policy that was on the edge of civil war. I made an
attempt to save us ... to save reform,'' he said.
   Virtually all Walesa's former advisers have sided with
Mazowiecki, leaving Walesa to assemble a new campaign team of
unionists and lesser-known politicians. But now, victory appears
within grasp.
   Walesa, a peasant's son with a trade-school education, said he
differs from his former colleagues, most of them from intellectual
circles, because he is not frightened by ordinary people and wants
to engage them in the political process.
   ``If you fear the masses, then of course the masses will defeat
you,'' he said. ``I am not afraid of the masses. I want to find
work for them, and I want to show them what's possible or
impossible, and then go on with what's possible and probable.''
   He said that if some day he sees a demonstration in front of his
presidential palace, ``I will come out and lead it.''
   Walesa deflected a question about whether he would ask Finance
Minister LEszek Balcerowicz, architect of Poland's shock economic
overhaul, to stay on if he is victorious.
   Without naming names, he said part of Mazowiecki's present
Cabinet could remain if he wins. BUt he said he would not be doing
any ``begging.''
   Asked why he had not done more to rebuke anti-Semitic
questioners during his rallies, Walesa said he had reminded Poles
in recent interviews that anti-Semitism is contradictory to their
CAtholicism.
   OF his past and future political battles, Walesa said bluntly:
``I was born only for victory. So I have to win.
   ``Maybe you see it as over-confidence. But if so, let me remind
you of my first statement (last summer) ... which today makes sense
even if it didn't then:to be the president.'
   ``It could be seen as conceit, trickery or pride. But in fact it
was the key with which I got the reform process moving.''
   He said he dreamed of uniting Solidarity again.
   ``I have been struggling for nine months to regain Solidarity's
position and to regain my position,'' he said. ``I do not know to
what extent it worked, but from what I see, it did.''

   Contempt fines levied against CNN should be used to
pay for Manuel Noriega's defense against drug smuggling charges, an
attorney for the deposed Panamanian dictator said Monday.
   On Sunday, the U.S. Supreme Court left intact a federal judge's
temporary order that barred CNN from airing tapes of jailhouse
phone conversations between Noriega and his defense team.
contempt of court hearing against CNN in view of the U.S. Supreme
Court's 7-2 decision.
   The defense has asked for fines of $300,000 per airing of the
conversations, and May said it will ask that money be used for a
Noriega defense trust fund.
   ``We're certainly going to suggest that might be one way of
solving a lot of problems, and I think an appropriate one,
considering the fact that GEneral Noriega's defense was damaged by
CNN,'' May said.
   That could allow NOriega to keep his private defense team even
though his funds have been frozen by federal prosecutors and
foreign governments.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said last week he would
decide soon whether to replace Noriega's private attorneys with
government-paid counsel. The private attorneys have said they
cannot stay on the case without some money.
   STeven Korn, chief counsel for CNN's parent company Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., said the network had no position on how
any fines it might pay should be dispersed because it doesn't
Expect to pay any.
   He said the network never aired privileged conversations under
Hoeveler's order.
   ``I think that point has been lost in the hue and cry,'' Korn
said. He noted that lead Noriega attorney Frank Rubino had
identified and described the conversation on the air, and even
pushed the button on the tape recorder.
   Hoeveler, meanwhile, has set a hearing for Tuesday on how to
proceed with the prison tapes at the center of the CNN-Noriega
dispute.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said Monday the tapes were being
Blown out of proportion.
   ``This is not as grand an issue as it is described as being,''
Lehtinen said. ``I think the taping by the government will be found
to be quite correct. Privileged conversations ... are not
privileged when you get on a phone from a prison, and you know it
is being taped.''
   He said the judge may well rule the tapes are not prejudicial to
Noriega's case.
   May said that such a ruling would neither keep Hoeveler from
Finding CNN in contempt, nor end the gag order.
between attorneys and a client,'' May said.
   Noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the
taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged government
misconduct, but Hoeveler has not ruled on the issue.
   Noriega is jailed outside of MIami on a drug-trafficking
indictment accusing him of accepting bribes to turn Panama into a
way station for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments. He has been held more
than 10 months and his trial isn't expected to begin before next
spring.

   Melbourne, Montreal and Seattle-Tacoma are the
best cities in which to live, the private Population Crisis
Committee said after surveying conditions in the world's 100
largest metropolitan areas.
   Lagos, Nigeria, is the worst, the group said Monday in an
analysis based on two years of research.
   Sharon L. Camp, the organization's senior vice president, said
the study wasn't a guidebook for retirement or business or
vacations but rather a warning about the dangers of rapid
population growth.
   ``MOre than half of these cities are sinking from the weight of
too many people,'' she said. ``More than anything else, the numbers
... add up to human population overload.''
   The committee analyzed living conditions in the metropolitan
areas, awarding up to 10 points in each of 10 categories.
   Melbourne, Australia; Montreal, Canada; and the Seattle-Tacoma
area each accumulated 86 of the possible 100 points.
   Lagos scored 19 points.
   Lagos averages 5.8 people per room in living space, only half
the city's houses have water and electricity and there is only one
telephone per 100 people.
   By comparison Melbourne and Montreal average 0.5 person per room
in housing and Seattle-Tacoma has 0.4. All residences in those
cities have water or electricity or both. Seattle-Tacoma has 106
telephones per 100 people, while there are 69 in Montreal and 45 in
Melbourne.
   Joining the three first-place cities in making up the five most
livable cities were Essen-Dortmund-Duisberg, Germany, and the
Atlanta, Ga., area. Both rated 85. The Detroit, Mich.-Windsor,
Ontario region finished sixth.
   With Lagos at the bottom of the list were: Kinshasa, Zaire, 29
points; Dhaka, Bangladesh, 32; and Recife, Brazil, Lima, Peru, and
Kanpur, India, each with 33 points.
   Two of the world's 100 largest cities - Bucharest, Romania, and
Rangoon, Burma - could not be ranked because of lack of data.
   Montreal Mayor Jean Dore said the city, ``like all other major
economic and cultural centers in the world, has to deal with major
social and environmental issues. But our city has an important
advantage over other big cities - Montreal wants to preserve its
heritage of the past while setting human scale development as the
keystone of the future.''
   Steve Morris, president of the Seattle-King County Convention
and Visitors Bureau, said: ``We're always thrilled when Seattle get
high marks in these kind of polls.''
   And Melbourne Mayor Richard Wynne called his community ``one of
the most convenient cities, a comfortable city and a safe city with
good transport and rich cultural activity.''
   Criteria for the rankings were:
   -Murders per 100,000 people: Capetown, South Africa, had the
highest rate at 64.7. Rated at less than one were Madrid, Spain;
Manchester, England; and BAndung, Indonesia.
   -Percent of income spent on food: Most expensive is Ho Chi Minh
City, Vietnam, 80 percent. Residents of 23 communities spend more
than half their income on food. Food accounted for 9 percent of
income in Washington, D.C.
   -People per room: Lagos was most crowded at 5.8, while Canton,
China had 5.7. All cities in the United States, Canada and
Australia as well as Madrid and Birmingham, England, had fewer than
0.5 person per room.
   -Percent of homes with water or electricity or both: At least 70
percent of homes had water and electricity in 87 percent of the
Metro areas, although the analysis didn't always take into account
squatter settlements or illegal water and electrical connections.
Kinshasa, Zaire and Johannesburg, South Africa, had two-thirds of
residents lacking running water or electricity or both.
   -Telephone per 100 people: San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose has
151 telephones per 100 people. Lagos, Ho Chi Minh City and Kinshasa
have less than 1.
   -Percent of children in secondary school: Moscow, Warsaw and
Essen-Dortmund-Duisberg each reported that 100 percent of
youngsters 14 to 17 were attending school. Johannesburg, Lagos and
Lahore, India, had fewer than one-third in school.
   -Infant deaths per 1,000 live births: Taipei, Taiwan, and three
Japanese urban areas (Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto, Tokyo-Yokohama and Nagoya)
had five infant deaths per 1,000 births. Kanpur, India, had 157.
   -Levels of ambient noise: Dallas-Fort Worth, Singapore and
Manchester were ranked as relatively quiet. Noisiest included New
York; London; Karachi, Pakistan; Madras, India; Lahore, Pakistan;
Madrid; Naples; Surabaya, Indonesia; and Monterrey, MExico.
   -Traffic flow in miles per hour in rush hour: Traffic managed
more than 40 mph in Atlanta, Casablanca, Houston, Belo Horizonte,
Brazil, and Detroit-Windsor. In Lima, it crawled along at 4 mph.
   -Air pollution: Taipei, Sydney and Melbourne were ranked as
having clean air. Dirtiest were Calcutta and New Delhi, India;
Jakarta, Indonesia; Tehran, Iran; Beijing and Shenyang, China; and
Milan, Italy.

<HEAD>Experts Seek Mysterious Source of Pollutants in Sea Lions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cause of surprisingly high levels of
chemical pollutants found in some North Pacific sea lions is a
mystery, a federal official said Monday.
   Chemical runoff from as far south as the Washington and Oregon
coasts could be responsible for contaminants found in two of eight
Alaskan Steller sea lions tested in what is considered pristine
Alaskan waters, said Roddy Moscoso of the National Marine Fisheries
Service.
   But he said there was no evidence that points to an actul
source and studies are continuing.
   ``Their diet, various fish species, do traverse a great deal of
the West Coast down into Washington. It is possible through runoffs
in Washington state and Oregon - in the migratory area - that they
could have been exposed to such levels,'' Moscoso said. ``It is a
mystery right now.''
   The study of a small sample of 23 animals was conducted by Usha
Varanasi, director of the service's Environmental Conservation
Division in Seattle.
   High levels of contaminants have been found in pilot whales
stranded on the coast of New England, but those levels were not
surprising ``given the water quality in that area,'' Moscoso said.
   However, the contaminants in the Steller sea lions were cause
for alarm.
   ``We would have considered where they live to be in a pristine
environment so it was of concern because we just had not idea the
contaminant concentrations would be that high,'' he said.

   Four bombs exploded before dawn
Monday at the suburban home of the Philippine justice secretary,
but he and his family escaped injury.
   The official, Franklin Drilon, said he, his wife Violetta and
two young sons were sleeping in the house at the time of the
attack.
   There was no claim of responsibility, and Drilon said he did not
know who the assailants were. But he said at least one of the bombs
contained the plastic explosive C-4, often used by right-wing
military extremists.
   The blasts heavily damaged a wall around the house, shattered
windows, overturned furniture and blasted a hole three feet deep in
the yard.
vehicles killed a city official and three companions in Cabanatuan
City, 60 miles north of Manila.
   The military said Andres Quibuyen, secretary of Cabanatuan Mayor
Honorato Perez, was being driven to the city hall when about four
men in a car and four others in a jeep opened fire, killing him,
his driver and two other people. Another companion was injured in
the attack.
   The motive for the attack was unknown.
   Meanwhile, published reports said military intelligence expects
right-wing extremists to launch a new coup attempt between Nov. 30
and Dec. 10.
   The Manila Chronicle and The Manila Times on Monday quoted
unnamed military sources as saying the plan called for coordinated
uprisings in northern and southern provinces directed by renegade
Commodore DOmingo Calajate, a leader of last December's failed
coup.
   Last month, mutineers staged a three-day uprising in Mindanao
island that the military said was to have been the trigger for a
series of nationwide revolts. The mutiny ended Oct. 6 when coup
leader Col. Alexander Noble surrendered.
   Drilon's department is responsible for prosecuting extremists
including the military dissidents responsible for seven armed
uprisings since PResident Corazon Aquino took office four years
ago.
   Mrs. Aquino said she was shocked at the attack on her justice
secretary.
   ``The important thing is for us not to lose heart because of
what we are doing because we believe in democracy,'' Mrs. Aquino
said at a news conference. ``We who believe in democracy should not
be coerced into surrendering to these terrorists.''
   Drilon was appointed justice secretary last Dec. 31 as part of a
Cabinet shakeup following a bloody coup attempt earlier in the
month. He had served as labor secretary since 1987.
   He also serves as chairman of the Cabinet Security Committee,
which advises Mrs. Aquino on national security issues.

<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction to their highest level in three
weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $10.0 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.08 percent, up from 7.05 percent
last week. Another $10.0 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.05 percent, up from 7.02 percent last
week.
   The rates were the highest since Oct. 29 when three-month bills
sold for 7.12 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.13 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
- 7.31 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,823.00 and 7.41 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,645.50.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.30
percent last week, down from 7.35 percent the previous week.

   A gunman took several people hostage in a
grocery store today, but released them unharmed and surrendered
after a 4{-hour standoff, authorities said.
   Several shots were fired inside the Food Lion store, but no one
was injured, said Lt. A.K. Shaban of the HAnover County Sheriff's
Department.
   Seward McGhee, assistant commonwealth's attorney, said the
Gunman held three or four hostages after initially allowing a
number of people to leave the store.
   The man, who was not immediately identified, gave up at 3:50
p.m., said Jody Chance, a sheriff's dispatcher.
   McGhee said authorities were told by hostages that the man -
armed with a semiautomatic handgun - robbed a nearby restaurant to
get money for an operation needed by his daughter.
   The standoff began about 11:20 a.m., when the gunman entered the
store at the Ashland Junction Shopping CEnter 15 miles north of
Richmond.
   A rescue squad member at the scene said the gunman was seen
running from a restaurant next door toward the shopping center with
what appeared to be a bag of money. He dropped the bag near a dry
cleaner's, ran inside, grabbed a customer and dragged her at
gunpoint to the Food Lion about 150 yards away, said the squad
member, who declined to be identified.
   One of the people who escaped from the Food Lion ran down the
driveway of the shopping center toward the restaurant.
   The woman, who declined to be identified, said: ``I was trying
to console him (the gunman), thinking it would help, and maybe it
did. I don't know. The best thing I knew to do was stay calm.''
   She said she went out the back door of Food Lion with two women
shoppers who said they crawled behind boxes of bananas to escape.
   At the nearby Ponderosa restaurant, employee Carolyn Duvall said
a man came in the back door about 10:50 a.m. and pointed a gun at
her.
   ``He just came in and told me to get down,'' she said. ``So I
got under the sink. He didn't say what he was here for. He just
asked for the manager.
   ``It was a little scary, but I was more scared than anything
that someone would have the nerve to do that,'' she said. ``Ino idea if
he got what he came for. I don't know what he got.''
   The man was inside about eight minutes and forced several
employees into a stockroom before he left, Ms. Duvall said. They
remained there for about three minutes, she added.
   POlice barred people from entering the shopping center.

   The Army on Monday ordered to active duty more
than 20,000 National Guard and Reserve combat troops for the
Persian Gulf crisis, and the Marine Corps said it was sending an
additional 6,496 combat reservists to the gulf.
   The Army and Marine Corps call-ups brought to approximately
41,000 the number of combat and non-combat reservists put on active
duty since President Bush last Wednesday raised the ceiling on the
number of reservists that could be used. Bush has authorized a
maximum call-up of 125,000 reservists from all services.
   Since the start of Operation Desert Shield Aug. 7, about 77,000
reservists have been called up - most in non-combat roles such as
transportation and cargo handling. It is the biggest call-up of
reservists since the Berlin crisis of 1961.
   Details of Monday's Army call-up, confirmed by Maj. Doug HArt, a
Pentagon spokesman, were not immediately available.
   Hart said those being activated included members of three
National Guard armored combat units - the 48th Infantry Brigade
(Mechanized) of Georgia, the 155th Armored Brigade of Mississippi
and the 256th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of Louisiana.
   The Army announced Friday that it had alerted those three combat
brigades to be prepared for call-up. The Army also called up 14,006
reservists for support roles Friday.
   The Marine Corps said in an announcement Monday that it ordered
6,496 Marine Corps Reserve members to active duty with the 2nd
Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Lejeune, N.C., starting next
week. The expeditionary force is scheduled to deploy to the Persian
Gulf area with reinforcements ordered by Bush two weeks ago.

   A man died Monday after setting himself on
fire in front of the U.S. Capitol as dozens of bystanders watched,
police said.
   The victim was burned beyond recognition and authorities said he
had not been identified. The reason for the suicide was not
immediately known.
   ``He stood for quite awhile,'' said a tourist from Iowa who saw
the man on fire as she walked out of the Capitol. ``A lot of people
were watching. ... It was pretty gruesome.''
   The woman, who would not give her name, said the man lay down,
turned on his back and reached to the sky before he died.
   ``It was awful,'' she said, adding that someone in the crowd
yelled that the fire department should be called.
   Officer Dan Nichols of the Capitol Police said an officer at the
door called for help.
   Nichols said the man used ``some sort of accelerant'' to feed
the flames, which also were hastened by a brisk wind that was
blowing. The man was pronounced dead at the scene.
   The incident occurred about 2 p.m. on an expansive landing part
way up the steps of the West Front of the building, facing the Mall
that stretches from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial.
   Though the Capitol is the scene of frequent protests, the
incident did not appear connected to any political cause, Nichols
said.

Around the building.
   Nichols said police made a sweep of the area with canine teams
in an effort to find something that would identify the victim and
to make certain the man didn't leave any dangerous devices or
materials on the grounds.

and president of the gallery and the art school affiliated with it
starting Jan. 1.
   Levy, 52, joined the Parsons School of Design in 1961. He
initiated the merger of Parsons and the New School in 1970 and
continued as Parsons' chief administrative officer until last year.
   Besides being an art historian and experienced administrator,
Levy is also a photographer and an active jazz musician, performing
on saxophone throughout the United States and abroad.
   Levy's appointment was announced in conjunction with a policy
statement in which the board reaffirmed the Corcoran's commitment
to freedom of expression.
   The Corcoran board said the gallery is ``solely responsible for
the appropriateness or acceptability'' of its exhibits. Criticism
or objections must not ``prevent an idea from being voiced, a work
from being seen, or a performance from being held,'' the board
said.
   The Corcoran, located only two blocks from the White House near
Pennsylvania Ave., is 120 years old and the oldest museum in
Washington.
   It attracted nationwide criticism when its former director,
Christina Orr-Cahall, canceled a controversial exhibit containing
sexually explicit photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
   She said she canceled the show, two weeks before it was
scheduled to open in the summer of 1989, to avoid getting embroiled
in the emotional debate over federal arts grant policies. But the
cancellation ignited an equally intense debate in the artistic
community, and Orr-Cahall resigned last February.
   A federal grant had helped finance the traveling Mapplethorpe
exhibit, which contained homoerotic and sadomasochistic images and
pictures of nude children.
   THe exhibit appeared without incident in Philadelphia and
Chicago before it was supposed to arrive in Washington. But in a
subsequent stop in Cincinnati, the gallery owner was arrested and
tried for violating obscenity laws. A jury acquitted him, but the
debate over federal arts funding still rages.
   The Corcoran board had been searching for a director since
Orr-Cahall announced last December she would be resigning.
   Levy issued a statement echoing the institution's renewed
commitment to freedom of artistic expression. ``It is my
unequivocal position that these freedoms must be jealously guarded,
and I see it as my obligation... to put that belief into
practice,'' he said.

<HEAD>Significantly Lower Wheat Crop Expected Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat production in 1991 will be down from
this year's near-record harvest, an Agriculture Department report
said Monday.
   Prospects now ``point to decidedly lower production'' next year,
the department's Economic Research Service said.
   The report said the area planted for the 1991 wheat crop will be
reduced, and ``there is no assurance that the 1990 record yield
(per acre) will be replicated.''
   However, analysts said the total U.S. supply of wheat in the
1991-92 marketing year, which will begin June 1, will be bolstered
by much larger stocks left from previous harvests.
   The 1991 idling requirement was set in the new farm bill at 15
percent of a farmer's wheat acreage base, compared with a 5 percent
requirement set-aside this year.
   No forecast of 1991 wheat production was included in the report.
This year's output was more than 2.74 billion bushels, up 35
percent from the drought-reduced 1989 harvest.
   The report projected the total U.S. wheat stockpile next June 1
at 945 million bushels, up from 536 million bushels last June 1.
   A 15 percent level for the 1991 wheat Acreage Reduction Program,
or ARP, would result in ``four to five times more wheat area
idled'' than the approximately two million acres idled in 1990
under the program, the report said.
   Farmers must participate in the program and idle part of their
acreage to qualify for price supports and other program benefits.

   Jean Rouaud on Monday won the 1990 Prix Goncourt,
France's most prestigious literary prize, for his first novel,
``The Fields of Honor.''
   The 159-page story published by Editions de Minuit explores the
mores of rural France through the memories of an old truck driver
recalling the significant deaths in his family: grandfather,
grandmother, father and aunt.
   The Goncourt jury awarded the prize on an 8-2 vote, with
Philippe Labro's ``The Little Boy'' Labro taking second place. It
marks the first time since 1950, when Paul Colin was honored for
``The Young Savages,'' that a first novel won.
   Rouaud, 38, continued to work in a Paris magazine shop.
   ABout 70,000 copies of ``The Fields of Honor'' are already in
print and sales are bound to increase because of the prize, which
is accompanied by a check for 50 francs ($10).
   An English translation is planned.
   The Renaudot Prize, a literary award traditionally given to
budding novelists, went to Jean Colombier, 44, for his second work,
``The Romanc Brothers,'' published by Calmann-Levy.
   A separate jury awarded Colombier the prize to after a record 25
rounds of voting. His novel tells a story of love, betrayal and
vengeance between two brothers.

<HEAD>Nuclear Inspectors Visiting Iraq at Invitation of Saddam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two inspectors from the International
Atomic Energy Agency are visiting Iraq at the invitation of the
Baghdad government, which wants the agency to verify it is not
developing nuclear weapons.
   The Iraqi News Agency quoted inspector Abdul Wahid al-Saji as
saying he and the other inspector were on a Nov. 18-22 visit ``to
Conduct their regular comprehensive inspection of the nuclear
installations and materials in Iraq.''
   Al-Saji said it was the second visit to Iraq this year by the
Vienna-based IAEA. The agency has said it found no violations by
Iraq during an April visit.
   The inspectors are apparently checking on a 27-pound mass of
highly enriched uranium that Iraq salvaged from the Osirak nuclear
reaction, which was destroyed by an Israeli air attack in 1981.
Scientists say this uranium could be fashioned into a primitive
nuclear bomb.
   The Iraqi government's invitation to the IAEA appeared aimed at
stripping away one justification for an invasion of Iraq. Some
Western officials have said that regardless of Kuwait's status, the
Middle East will never be safe as long as President Saddam Hussein
could threaten to use nuclear weapons.
   Researchers have claimed for years that Iraq is trying to
develop a nuclear bomb. Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies published a report Sunday that Iraq is capable of
developing such a wepaon within three to five years.
   Iraq is a signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that
binds nations to renounce the possession or use of nuclear weapons
and to submit to regular inspections of their uranium by IAEA
officials.

   Despite economic gloom and higher fuel prices,
American drivers plan to hit the road in higher numbers this
Thanksgiving, but the nation's airlines aren't expecting a similar
surge.
   The American Automobile Association reported Monday that more
people are expecting to drive 100 miles or more for Thanksgiving,
based on a survey of 1,500 adults.
   The airlines, meanwhile, are predicting no improvement over last
year, a discouraging sign forsluggish demand and steady increases in jet
fuel prompted by the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``Historically, we have exceeded the previous year, but this
year we think we'll be flat,'' said STephen Hayes of the Air
Transport Association of America.
   Even though gasoline prices have risen by nearly 30 cents a
gallon since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, AAA pointed out that an
automobile that gets 20 miles a gallon can go 100 miles for less
than $7.
   About 22.5 million people, 9 percent of the population, will
drive to holiday feasts, AAA said. The number should be 3 percent
higher than a year ago, although Thanksgiving travel is generally
down from levels of the mid-1980s, the AAA said.
   When the economy suffers, people are less likely to plan trips,
AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom said. But the auto club was surprised
that higher gasoline prices don't seem to be having much of an
impact.
   ``We often hear analysts talk about the psychological effects of
higher gas prices, but we haven't seen it in holiday travel,''
Sundstrom said.
   AAA estimated that the number of people making Thanksgiving
trips by airplanes and on trains and buses would stay the same this
year, at about 3.5 million.
   ``I'm sure the fuel prices have had an effect,'' Hayes said air
transport. ``There's no question but that we're suffering from both
an economic slowdown and sharply rising jet fuel prices. Because of
those two, we are seeing some fall-off in traffic.''
   Hayes' association estimated a total of 9 million boardings will
occur from Tuesday to Monday, for a rough total of 4.5 million
people making round trips. The figures are for all boardings, so
many of those travelers might not be taking Thanksgiving trips.
   Even though the overall figures are staying the same, numbers
are off at some airlines.
   TWA, for example, anticipates some 22,000 passengers will go
through its St. Louis hub Wednesday, and 26,600 will pass through
Sunday. The comparable figures a year ago were 27,000 and 30,000 on
those days, which are among the most heavily traveled, spokesman
Jim Faulkner said.
   ``With the state of the economy, a lot of people are opting to
drive who may have flown in years past,'' Faulkner said. ``Most of
the airlines are cutting capacity, because many of them have too
many seats out there.''
   After the Gulf crisis sent oil prices spiraling, airlines
responded with fare increases totaling about 15 percent. Even
though many passengers took advantage of discount tickets offered
before the increases kicked in, the higher fares might be
Discouraging to some.
   Even in tough times, it's hard to keep people home on the
holidays, according to the head of the American Society of Travel
Agents.
   ``Thanksgiving travel is close to being a necessity,'' said the
group's president, Philip Davidoff. ``Even when things are tight,
people will go home anyway.''
   Some travel agents agree.
   ``When I look back at a prior recession ... we had no reduction
of people deciding to travel,'' said H. Wayne Berens, president of
Revere Travel Inc., based in Trenton, N.J.
   Of course, you can't go to Grandma's if you've been shipped to
the Saudi desert, and Berens thinks the troop buildup in the Middle
East may be having an impact.
   ``It takes out another quarter million people from the potential
traveling public,'' Berens said. ``But it means dependents aren't
traveling, either.''

<HEAD>Con Artist Sent to Prison for Bilking Priests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   NEW YORK - A man who bilked more than $133,000 from dozens of
Roman CAtholic priests around the country by telling them hard-luck
stories has been sent to prison for two years and ordered to pay
Full restitution.
   Robert Riggio was sentenced last week and ordered to pay
restitution of $133,606 to his victims.
   U.S. District Judge Miriam G. Cedarbaum also ordered Riggio,
described as a compulsive gambler, to join GAmblers Anonymous.
   From May 1987 to last March, Riggio posed as a parishioner with
family troubles and convinced nearly 50 priests nationwide to wire
him loans ranging from $200 to $20,000.
   Riggio did most of his work over the telephone, persuading the
priests to wire money or arranging for messengers to pick up the
Cash, court records said.
   ``Obviously, he took advantage of peoples' better nature for his
own gain,'' one victim, the Rev. Michael Huerter of St. Louis
Catholic Church in upstate Pittsford, said in a telephone interview
Monday.
   ``He's a thief. That's the long and short of the story,'' said
another victim, the Rev. Charles Brady, of Cody, Wyo.
   Brady wired Riggio $2,000 after a late night telephone call in
which Riggio poed as a local resident who needed money to keep his
daughter from being kicked out of an East Coast university.
   FBI officials arrested Riggio, 44, of New York City, in April
and he pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in June. He
promised to repay his victims but never did, court papers said.
   Investigators said Riggio, who is separated from his wife and
has two sons ages 25 and 15, apparently used the money to pay
gambling debts.
   Because Riggio always seemed well-informed about each parish,
Huerter said he believed that he had consulted a national directory
of Catholic churches, which lists priests and other church
officials.
   The Rev. Bryan Dalton of St. Richard's Catholic Church in Miami
got his phone call last December.
   The caller, claiming to have met Dalton at a recent Mass, said
he needed money because his mother had been mugged the night
before.
   ``I had a suspicion when I went to Western Union, but I thought
I'd give the guy the benefit of the doubt,'' said Dalton, who lost
$650.
   The priest who lost the most was the Rev. Donald W. Simmons of
St. Ann's Catholic Church in Bonners Ferry, Idaho. HE wired RIggio
a total of $20,000 in 10 payments between Oct. 6, 1989, and Nov.
20, 1989.
   Simmons declined to be interviewed when reached by telephone on
Monday.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of Nov. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled a 12-year high of
8.74 million head, up 10 percent from a year ago and 7 percent more
than two years ago, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Feedlot inventories were up from a year earlier in Colorado,
Iowa, KAnsas, Nebraska and Texas. But they declined in Arizona and
California. Overall, the report said it was ``the largest November
number on feed since 1978.''
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in October totaled 1.61 million
head, down 1 percent from a year ago but 2 percent more than two
years ago.
month was reported at 2.75 million head, up 4 percent from a year
ago and 12 percent more than in October 1988, the report said.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states, which account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Nov.
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

<HEAD>For Some, Summit Offers Respite From Troubles At Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For some world leaders, the 34-nation summit here
offers a welcome respite from troubles at home.
   Britain's Margaret Thatcher, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
France's premier Michel Rocard, Poland's Tadeusz Mazowiecki - all
would rather be in Paris acting statesmanlike than deal with
domestic political challenges.
   But they needed go no further than sidewalk news stands for a
reminder:
   ``Rocard facing censure,'' the influential Paris daily Le Figaro
headlined. Further down on the front page, it carried a large
article on Mrs. Thatcher's challenger as ``the man who scares
Thatcher.''
   The leaders feigned indifference. When asked whether she would
like to be remembered for her role in the current summit, Mrs.
Thatcher, not known for her love of European affairs, bristled: ``I
think I'll be remembered for a lot more than that. But it's not
time to write memoirs yet.''
   Gorbachev, lauded by world leaders and applauded by a Paris
crowd, looked every inch the statesman. Only his occasionally glum
visage and a warning on the dangers of ethnic passions betrayed the
woes that have him pounding the lecterns and hurriedly revamping
his government at home.
   Like Gorbachev, many of the East European leaders in Paris are
threatened by winter food and energy shortages that could combine
with rising ethnic passions to stir violence and chaos.
   The glumness of bare stores and stoic queues, the dimness of
cities like Bulgaria's Sofia, now suffering power cuts 50 percent
of the time, are hard to imagine in the vibrant, gleaming French
capital.
   Official lunches like that MOnday at the Elysee Palace, or
Tuesday night's planned dinner and ballet soiree at Versailles are
something beyond the imagination of millions of Soviets and East
Europeans.
   Leaders like Romania's President Ion Iliescu, attending his
first big European gathering, could try only to offer the folks
back home the novel comfort of acceptance in the international
community. Iliescu demonstratively put an arm round French host
Francois Mitterrand when posing for pictures.
   Western leaders, too, could take solace in the Paris
proceedings.
   Mrs. Thatcher on Tuesday faces the most serious challenge of her
11{ years in office in a contest with her former Defense Secretary,
Michael Heseltine, for the leadership of the Conservative Party.
   President Bush helped out a little Monday morning, scheduling a
breakfast with Thatcher that thrust her into the international
Limelight Heseltine has lacked since he quit Thatcher's government
in disgust in 1986.
   Yet Bush also needs the Paris proceedings to bolster his policy
on the Persian Gulf and help fend off questions at home about
whether or not the United States should contemplate war to get Iraq
out of Kuwait. Bush himself has seen his popularity plummet in the
face of newly enacted tax increases and a looming recession.
   Another Western leader under fire is the French premier, Rocard,
buffeted by massive student demonstrations in the past two weeks
and threatened Monday by a parliamentary motion of no confidence.
   For the first time, rightists and Communists were united in
opposing the Socialist premier, but their effort fell five votes
short of an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly.
The motion's failure allowed Rocard's 2-year-old government to
survive, but his future remains uncertain.
   The drama of the leaders' sideshows barely penetrated the wall
of security and protocol that serves to keep them isolated during
the three-day summit.
   Gorbachev made only the most glancing of references to Soviet
woes, then quickly pledged that any difficulties would not diminish
his country's importance on the world stage.
   But leaders from both West and East seemed alert to the multiple
dangers to the new democracy they gathered in Paris to celebrate.
   On Monday afternoon, speaker after speaker alluded to the
dangers of nationalism, the poverty facing the East and the
resulting mass migration to an unprepared West.
   Perhaps most striking was Gorbachev's warning that nationalism
and separatism could have a ``destructive snowball effect'' if any
government gives way to them.

<TEXT>
   Iraq on Monday tempered its plan to release
all foreign hostages between Christmas and March and also declined
to guarantee the safety of Westerners still hiding in Kuwait.
   Information Minister Latif Nassayif Jassim indicated a U.N.
resolution authorizing a military offensive could jeopardize the
hostage release.
   At the same time, the minister hinted the so-called ``hostage
bazaar'' is still open for business in Iraq, that the country might
Barter the release of some foreigners in exchange for medicine and
other considerations from Switzerland.
   Later, the government announced that an unspecified number of
Swiss would be allowed to leave ``in appreciation'' of a Swiss
delegation's visit to Baghdad.
   Jassim also denounced the U.S. and British description of the
hostage release as a ploy.
   ``The rulers of Britain and the United States do not want peace
in the region, or resolution of its problems on a comprehensive
basis,'' Jassim said.
   Iraq referred to its hostage release plan as a gesture for
peace. But on Monday, the government announced new plans in case of
war.
   Iraq's general command, after a meeting chaired by President
Saddam Hussein, announced it was sending seven new divisions to
Kuwait and calling up 150,000 reservists for eventual duty in the
occupied country.
   The statement said the decision, taken in response to the
recently announced addition of 200,000 American forces in the
region, would add about 250,000 troops to the 430,000 already in
Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   Hussein decided Sunday that all foreign hostages would be freed
in batches beginning Dec. 25 if nothing happens to disturb the
atmosphere of peace.
   ``If during the departure period an attack would take place,
then of course the departures would be affected,'' said Jassim.
   But the minister declined to say if something short of an
attack, such as passage of a U.N. resolution authorizing
offensives, would be enough to disrupt the planned hostage
releases.
   ``We are watching the situation,'' said Jassim when asked if
such a resolution would block the plan.
   Jassim, at a news conference, also declined to guarantee that
Westerners in Kuwait could emerge from hiding without risking
arrest and relocation to a potential military target. Five Germans
and two Americans reportedly were arrested Saturday in Kuwait.
   ``This is a procedural thing that is not related to the
political attitude,'' said Jaseem. ``Every foreigner should report
to Iraqi authorities so they can be registered and protected by
Iraqi authorities. This is a matter of rules and regulations.''
   Iraqi officials have detained hundreds of foreigners, whom they
call guests, at strategic sites around the country to deter an
attack by the allied forces in Saudi Arabia. Diplomats in Baghdad
say there are at least 104 Americans and 353 Britons held at such
sites.
   Hundreds of other foreigners are being kept in Iraq and Kuwait
against their will by the Iraqi government.
   Jassim said that the release applied to all foreign hostages.
Still, Western hostages interviewed in Baghdad said they were not
optmistic.
   ``I think the timing is very cunning, stretching from Christmas
to Ramadan,'' said one Westerner who asked not to be identified.
``I don't think they (the Americans and the British) will go for
it.''
   ``It didn't really generate any jumping up and down. Everybody
is conditioned now to take just about everything with a great deal
of thought,'' said Roland Burgheer, a 62-year-old American living
in a diplomatic safe house with an undisclosed number of other
Americans.
   ``It's nice to think about but it didn't really generate a lot
of excitement'' said Burgheer. ``A lot of things have transpired
here in the past that might have suggested the same thing.''
   ``I don't personally care to be let go if it involves
negotiations of some kind,'' he said.
   Jassim, however, showed no reluctance for certain types of
negotiations. He said a deal to release 24 Swiss nationals, 25
employees of Swiss companies and up to 150 other foreigners
depended on reaching agreement on medical supplies and other
considerations from the Swiss.
   ``This question depends on several arrangements up for
consideration ... they are dealing with arrangements for holding a
peace conference in Switzerland and some medical supplies for
Iraq,'' Jassim said.
   A delegation of five Swiss politicians, led by Edgar Oehler, a
Christian Democrat, has been negotiating for the release. He said
the Swiss, acting privately but still respecting the UN embargo on
Iraq and Swiss policy, have offered Geneva as a site for an
international peace conference and other unspecified concessions.
   Sources who declined to be identified hinted the deal may
involve a shipment of up to 12 tons of medical supplies.
   Oehler said he had given the Iraqis a list of about 200
foreigners, including 36 Americans, that he hoped to take out of
the country. The Iraqis, he said, had insisted that the arrangement
be approved by the Swiss government.
   ``Everything is prepared,'' said Oehler. ``All I need is
feedback from this government (Iraq) then everything is settled.''

<TEXT>
   Judge Patricia M. Wald said Monday she will
step aside as chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit to allow Judge Abner J. Mikva to take
the post.
   Wald, 62, said she plans to step down before Mikva's 65th
birthday, Jan. 21. Under the law, federal judges cannot become
chief judges of their courts if they have turned 65.
   ``That's the only reason I am doing it. I enjoy the job (but)
there will be plenty to do just judging,'' said Wald, who will
remain an active judge on the court.
   The chief judgeship is determined by seniority.
   Wald said both she and Mikva, then a Democratic congressman from
Illinois, were nominated by President Carter on the same day in
1979.
   ``It's just the luck of the draw I got confirmed a couple of
weeks before he did,'' she said.
   ``Under ordinary circumstances, I would be happy to serve out my
term,'' said Wald, who became chief judge in 1986. The law allows
judges to serve up to seven years as chief judges or until they
reach age 70.
   The D.C. Circuit, along with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New York, is considered one of the most important
federal appellate courts in the nation.
   Because it's located in the nation's capitll, the court reviews
judicial decisions affecting a wide range of government policies.
It also has original jurisdiction to consider challenges to the
actions of many federal regulatory agencies, such as the Federal
Communications Commission.
   In recent years, the court has become at times bitterly divided
between liberal judges appointed by Democratic presidents and a
growing conservative faction, mostly appointed by President Reagan.
   Two judges nominated by President Bush, A. Raymond Randolph and
Karen L. Henderson, recently took the bench.
   Wald denied speculation in legal circles that she was stepping
aside to ensure that Laurence H. Silberman, a Reagan appointee
known for his combative demeanor on the bench, does not become
chief judge.
   ``I honestly can tell you I am doing it because of my friendship
with Judge Mikva,'' Wald said.
   Nevertheless, Wald's decision to give Mikva a chance to serve
five years as chief judge could prevent Silberman, 55, from
becoming chief judge.
   Mikva could serve five years before being succeeded by Judge
Harry Edwards, now 50, who could serve a full seven-year term. By
then Silberman would be 67.

<HEAD>Researchers Acuse FDA Of Imperiling Supply Of French Abortion
Drug</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical researchers accused the Food and Drug
Administration Monday of imperiling their supply of a French
abortion drug that shows promise in treating cancer and other
diseases.
   Scientists are being ``whiplashed by the FDA decision'' to issue
an import alert on the French drug RU-486, Dr. George P. Chrousos,
of the National Institute of Child Health and Development in
Bethesda, Md., said at a congressional hearing.
   ``I won't be able to initiate a new study'' because of the
uncertain supply of RU-486, Chrousos said. He said the reluctance
by the French company, Roussel-Uclaf, to supply it for research in
this country was ``unethical.''
   The FDA got ``carried away'' under pressure from the
right-to-life movement and ``may have made a political decision,''
Chrousos added.
   The FDA issued an import alert in June 1989 barring the abortion
drug for personal use after getting inquiries from right-to-life
groups and a dozen members of Congress who oppose abortion,
including Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Rep. Robert Dornan,
R-Calif.
   Since then, some U.S. researchers have had difficulty getting
the drug from its French manufacturer, which fears its business
could suffer if it becomes embroiled in an abortion controversy.
   The regulatory agency's import alert was not a politically
motivated decision, the FDA's Ronald G. Chesemore told the House
subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities and energy.
   And ``there was no intention'' of slowing down the supply of the
drug for scientific research, said Chesemore, the FDA's associate
commissioner for regulatory affairs.
   The drug has shown promise in treating breast and brain cancer,
Cushing's Syndrome and other diseases. Cushing's Syndrome is a
disorder of the pituitary gland.
   The FDA didn't consult leading U.S. researchers before issuing
the import alert, testified Dr. Kathryn Horwitz, a professor of
medicine at the University of Colorado.
   The FDA announced the alert 19 days after demands for it from
members of Congress.
   ``This certainly must be a new land-speed record for an agency
response to congressional inquiries,'' observed subcommittee
chairman Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. He called FDA's action ``very
irresponsible.''
   Wyden suggested that Health and Human Services Department
Secretary Louis Sullivan urge the French company to ensure adequate
supplies of the drug for U.S. research.
   The FDA conceded that it issued the alert without evidence that
there was a black market for the drug in the United States or that
it was being brought here illegally.
   But Chesemore explained that publicity about the drug raised the
possibility of ``clandestine distribution.''

<HEAD>Christian Militia Defies Deadline for Withdrawal from Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A right-wing Christian militia refused to
evacuate Beirut before a midnight deadline Monday despite a
government warning it would send troops to forceably evict the
fighters.
   The (5 p.m EST) deadline passed with Samir's Geagea's Lebanese
Forces, the main Christian militia, holding out in the east Beirut
districts they control. The militia served notice they would not
withdraw unless the government curbs violations by Geagea's
pro-Syrian rivals.
   The 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces and its allied Phalange Party
also demanded the expulsion from Christian east Beirut of rival
militiamen under Syrian-backed Maronite Catholic warlord Elie
Hobeika.
   Lebanese President Elias Hrawi rushed to Damascus to discuss
with Syrian President Hafez Assad whether to use force or further
diplomacy to make Geagea leave east Beirut.
   Geagea's intransigence was the first major hitch in the
implementation of Hrawi's plan to create a militia-free capital as
he tries to end Lebanon's 15-year civil war, which has left 150,000
people dead.
   The largest Shiite Moslem militias - the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
and the pro-Syrian Amal - have already agreed to withdraw from
Beirut.
   Hobeika and his estimated 1,500 militiamen returned to parts of
Christian east Beirut and the adjoining Metn mountains after
Hrawi's troops and the Syrian army dislodged rebel Gen. Michel Aoun
from the area last month.
   Aoun had been holed up in the presidential palace for more than
a year, blocking Hrawi's efforts to end the militia war and
establish an Syria-brokered peace place for Lebanon.
   Geagea, who deposed Hobeika in a 1986 power struggle, claims
supporters of his archrival have kidnapped scores of his partisans
and occupied and looted Phalangist offices in Metn province.
   The Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, a televison station
Geagea controls, said Hobeika's gunmen had kidnapped, beaten and
tortured at least 30 civilian supporters of the Lebanese Forces.
   The station aired a report showing a man identified as Youssef
Habshi, his back lacerated by whip lashes, moaning in pain in a
hospital bed. It said he had been held captive by Hobeika's men for
a week.
   ``Do they want us to spread this brutality to the rest of east
Beirut?'' Geagea said.

<HEAD>Bank President Sought in Apparent $13 Million Embezzlement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank examiners investigating a possible
$13 million embezzlement at a bank closed by the state studied the
institution's murky records Monday while police searched for its
missing president.
   A handful of angry depositors showed up at the Heritage Loan and
Investment Co. demanding their money but were turned away by state
police. Dozens more called, seeking reassurance their money was
safe.
   The state obtained a judge's order putting the two-office bank
into receivership Sunday after a four-day run drained $13.6 million
of its $22.4 million in deposits and weakened a private bank
insurance system.
   Police did not know the whereabouts of Joseph Mollicone Jr.,
Heritage's president and controlling stockholder, although ``our
information is that he's still very healthy,'' state police Maj.
Elwood M. Johnson said.
   He would not comment further because of a grand jury
investigation.
   Mollicone, of Providence, disappeared Nov. 8, four days before
the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corp. disclosed that
Heritage's records were in disarray. The indemnity corporation is a
$25 million fund that covers many credit unions and smaller banks.
   WJAR-TV reported last week that Mollicone last was seen taking a
flight to New Jersey.
   ``It appears to us to be an embezzlement,'' said Peter A.
Nevola, president and chief executive of the indemnity corporation,
which took control of the bank Oct. 18.
   Almost 20 examiners and bank employees tried to reconstruct
paperwork on loans that Nevola said apparently were made in the
names of depositors without their knowledge.
   State regulators, in a Superior Court affidavit seeking the
receivership, estimated the loss at $13 million, but Nevola said it
could be higher.
   ``It appears the loans were created to plug a hole in the bank's
assets to meet liabilities,'' Nevola said.
   Mollicone apparently served as a one-man loan committee for the
bank with few controls.
   ``Regardless of what may have been required ... one individual
disbursed the credit,'' Nevola said, though he stopped short of
saying Mollicone took the money.
   Notices in the bank's windows told customers of the cloing.
   ``My company's money is in here,'' said an angry woman, who
identified herself as a real estate broker. ``I need it now, not
tomorrow. They shouldn't freeze it. It's wrong. It's my money, not
the state's.''
   Robert Goldberg, a Department of Business Regulation lawyer,
answered a telephone at the bank for anxious depositors. By midday
he had told about 50 callers only that the bank would reopen in a
few days and that their money was insured up to $500,000 by the
indemnity corporation.
   ``As soon as the bank opens, I expect all these people will be
in'' to withdraw their money, he said. ``The last thing we want to
tell them is that it will be three days and then have them banging
down the door if it can't open in three days.''
   Goldberg said there were a few abusive callers but most were
just concerned.
   ``A lot of people have said they have their life savings (in the
bank). It ranges from a woman with $50 in a Christmas club to one
with $100,000 from the sale of a house. Frankly, the woman with
$100,000 seemed less concerned than some of the others with $100,''
Goldberg said.
   RISDIC insures $1.6 billion in deposits at 35 credit unions and
10 banks in Rhode Island.
   Some of the credit unions have applied to join the federal
insurance program.
   In a similar case in 1985, the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund
collapsed after the failure of the much-larger Home State Savings
Bank.
   Nevola said the Rhode Island agency was different because its
members are obligated to replenish the fund and so far had been
assessed an additional $5.5 million to do so. No other member
institutions had reported large amounts of withdrawals, he said.

<TEXT>
   The U.N. General Assembly took up a
resolution Monday demanding that Burma free all political prisoners
and challenging its military rulers to hand over power to the
opposition.
   In the past, the assembly has been reluctant to delve into the
internal affairs of a member state. However, many foreign countries
have shown revulsion for the Burmese military's brutal suppression
of the country's pro-democracy movement.
   Sweden introduced the draft resolution in the assembly's
so-called Third Committee, which deals with human rights, free
elections and other social and humanitarian issues. The committee
will vote on it Nov. 28, and the entire General Assembly will do so
around Dec. 18.
   Twenty countries co-sponsored the resolution - the 12 European
Community nations along with Australia, Canada, Austria, Norway,
Iceland, Poland, Sweden and Hungary.
   General Assembly resolutions have no binding effect, but they
are a powerful expression of the international community's will.
   The draft resolution expresses concern over the failure of
Burma's military rulers to obey ``the will of the people'' by
turning over power to the opposition.
   Though the opposition won popular elections in May by a
landslide, the military rulers of the Southeast Asian country have
refused to step down. They say a new constitution must be drafted
first, a lengthy process.
   The U.N. assembly's draft resolution also ``stresses its
conviction ... that all citizens detained with respect to their
political activities ought to be released immediately and restored
to the full enjoyment to their right to participate in the
government of their country.''
   Amnesty International on Monday said Maung Ko, a senior Burmese
opposition leader, had been found hanged in his cell Nov. 9. The-52
year-old leader had been detained for two weeks, the rights group
said.
   Burma's government said he committed suicide. But Amnesty said
the man's family believes he was tortured to death because his body
was covered with bruises and one leg was broken.
   Many opposition members are imprisoned or detained. The leader
of the opposition, Aung San Suu Kyi, is under house arrest.
   Amnesty says many hundreds, perhaps thousands, of suspected
government opponents have been detained without trial or sentenced
to prison terms by unfair military tribunals.
   At least 100 people have been sentenced to death, although it is
not known if any sentences have been carried out, Amnesty said.
   In 1988, Burma was swept by pro-democracy protests. The military
government cracked down, and hundreds of people were killed.

   The government has questioned former
ministers of deposed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government
about the 1988 plane crash that killed military ruler Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq, police said Monday.
   No one has ever been officially blamed for the Aug. 17, 1988,
crash of the C-130 transport plane that killed Zia, about a dozen
of the country's top-ranking military officers and U.S. Ambassador
Arnold Raphel.
   An inquiry by the Pakistan and U.S. military concluded it was
``an act of sophisticated technical sabotage.''
   When Ms. Bhutto came into power in December 1988, further
investigation was put on hold, although Zia's son, Ijaz ul-Haq,
demanded a reopening of the inquiry.
   Some of Ms. Bhutto's opponents suggested terrorists allegedly
led by her brother, Murtaza, had been involved in the crash. Her
brother had been in exile in Syria.
   Police officials said investigators are looking into whether
Al-Zulfikar, a terror group named after their late father, Prime
Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was involved in the crash. The elder
Bhutto was overthrown by Zia in 1977 and hanged two years later.
   Murtaza and Ms. Bhutto deny any connection with Al-Zulfikar.
   Farooq Azam, a former deputy minister for railways in the Bhutto
government, and a former minister for prisons in Punjab Province,
Riaz Hussain Pirzada, are being questioned in the current
investigation, said a senior official of the Federal Investigation
Agency.
   Ms. Bhutto's government was dismissed by the president Aug. 6,
charging massive corruption and abuse of power, and replaced by a
caretaker government. Her party was soundly defeated in elections
last month.

<HEAD>White House Economics Adviser Says Too Early To Declare Recession</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush may have used the word
``downturn'' to describe the economy last week, but his chief
economics adviser said Monday that it was still too early to tell
whether the country is in a recession.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, said there were ``substantial risks'' to the economy if
oil prices stay at current high levels or rise even further.
   He described current conditions as very sluggish but he said it
would be premature to declare a recession.
   ``I think that regardless of what one calls it, clearly the
economy at best is in sort of a lull with very little growth, if
any,'' Boskin said in response to a question during an appearance
before the National Press Club.
   Boskin said the oil shock could be expected to shave about one
percentage point off growth and boost inflation by 1.5 to 2
percentage points.
   In the third quarter, economic growth, as measured by the gross
national product, was rising at a weak annual rate of 1.8 percent.
By the traditional rule of thumb, a recession is defined as two
consecutive quarters of negative GNP growth.
   ``It is too early to tell whether the United States will have a
negative fourth quarter or whether we will enter a recession,''
Boskin said. ``We will just have to wait for the data for another
couple of months to get a better feel for how the economy is
doing.''
   Many private economists, however, contend that the country has
slipped into a recession and that government statistics will
confirm that fact in coming months.
   Last Thursday, Bush conceded for the first time that the country
may be facing a recession, saying, ``I am concerned that we're in a
downturn here.''
   Bush held four private meetings last week with his economic
advisers and outside business leaders, seeking ways to dampen the
impact of the economic slowdown.
   Administration officials said the outside business leaders
expressed the general view that the country has tipped into its
first recession since the severe 1981-82 slump.
   Officials said it will be at least another month before any
decisions are made on what programs Bush will recommend, including
in his 1992 budget proposal, to stimulate economic growth. Boskin
gave no hint in his appearance Monday about what the administration
is considering.

<HEAD>Railroad Worker Entitled to Black Lung Benefits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired railroad employee who was exposed
to coal dust at work is entitled to black lung benefits, a federal
appeals court ruled Monday.
   Attorneys for both sides said the ruling marks the first time a
railroad worker has been awarded black lung benefits, which usually
are paid to coal miners with lung disease.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld findings by an
administrative law judge and the Benefits Review Board that Olen R.
Roberson deserved the benefits that usually are paid to coal miners
with lung disease.
   ``Our holding is necessarily narrow. In the ordinary case a
railroad employee engaged in the transportation of coal may well
not qualify for benefits,'' said the opinion written by Judge H.
Emory Widener Jr. and joined by Judge J. Dickson Phillips Jr.
   Lawrence L. Moise III, who represented Roberson in the case
against Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co., said the ruling sets a
precedent for other railroad workers seeking black lung benefits.
   ``The railroad employees have been filing for federal black lung
benefitsfor years now and it's been a disputed issue as to whether
they qualified,'' he said. ``Everyone was waiting to see what was
going to happen on this particular case.''
   But Moise added that the ruling may not help many workers.
   ``Unfortunately a lot of railroad workers that worked in the
coalfields will get the wrong impression from this decision,'' he
said. ``It is a very narrow decision.''
   The ruling may help railroad employees who worked around raw
coal, but not those who transported coal after it was washed at a
preparation plant, Moise said.
   Clinton S. Morse, an attorney for the railroad, agreed that the
case set a precedent. He was not sure whether the ruling would be
appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court or how many other N&amp;W workers
could be eligible for benefits.
   Roberson is totally disabled from pneumoconiosis, a lung disease
that can be caused by inhaling coal dust. He applied for black lung
benefits in 1978, a year before he retired from a 32-year career
with the railroad.
   For 14 years, Roberson spent a large amount of his workday at
coal mines and around railroad cars that carried raw coal from the
mines to a preparation plant.
   His duties included coupling and uncoupling high pressure air
hoses between the cars, which blew coal dust into the air, the
opinion said.
   ``Although Roberson never participated in the actual loading or
unloading of coal, he was continually exposed to large amounts of
coal dust,'' the court said.
   The court disagreed with N&amp;W's contention that riding on a
railroad car does not meet the requirement that those who get black
lung benefits have worked in or around a mine.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet soldier ran amok with an armored vehicle
in Berlin after his girlfriend at home jilted him, police said, and
he led authorities on a wild chase of rammed cars and smashed
barricades for hours Monday.
   His armored personnel carrier roared down the Kurfuerstendamm,
the fanciest boulevard in the once-forbidden zone of West Berlin,
at 5 a.m.
   What would have been a dangerous international incident during
the Cold War was only a cop chase in today's relaxed East-West
atmosphere. No one was hurt.
   German police and Soviet military officials pursued the soldier,
identified only as a 20-year-old sergeant from the Ukrainian city
of Kharkov, for block after block as dawn broke.
   He was finally arrested near suburban Potsdam about 7 a.m. after
a Red Army sergeant leaped on the renegade tracked vehicle and
slammed shut the driver's vision slit, ending a journey of at least
40 miles.
   Police later said the soldier had received a letter from his
girlfriend that broke his heart. He showed no signs of mental
illness or drunkenness, police said.
   The sergeant's pre-dawn odyssey began at a Red army base in
Elstal, a small town four miles west of the Berlin city limits on
former East German territory.
   Driving without lights, he sped southwest toward Potsdam where
German police first saw the vehicle. Soviet military patrols had
earlier spotted the wayward driver.
   His vehicle smashed a truck blocking the street and reached the
highway leading to the center of what was West Berlin until unity
six weeks ago.
   The Berlin Wall prevented such escapades until Nov. 9, 1989.
Even after the concrete barricade fell, Soviet soldiers were
forbidden to travel to West Berlin without special permission.
   The ride took the soldier down the Kurfuerstendamm, the
tree-lined boulevard lit by twinkling Christmas lights, past the
luxury KaDeWe department store and other elegant shops.
   The straying soldier rammed a German police car before crossing
into what was East Berlin. There he headed down Leipziger Strasse,
a major avenue not far from where Checkpoint Charlie once stood. A
resident complained of loud motor noises as the determined driver
headed east and then south toward Potsdam.
   A Soviet truck that had been following the entire time finally
overtook the speeding vehicle and a Soviet sergeant jumped on and
shut the vision slit.
   The soldier was taken into custody for questioning.
   Senior German government officials have expressed concern about
the estimated 360,000 Soviet soldiers still stationed on former
East German territory, many of whom live on bases in the forests
around Berlin.
   The Red army has far fewer military duties now that former enemy
West Germany has incorporated Warsaw Pact-dropout East Germany.
Complete withdrawal of former front-line force against NATO is not
scheduled until 1994.
   Monday's jaunt is the most spectacular reported misuse of Soviet
army equipment.
   Police have seized caches of weapons being sold by soldiers.
Reports say soldiers at a training base outside Berlin will take
civilians for a tank ride for 100 marks ($68).
   Visits are still rare and Soviet soldiers are not encouraged to
spend time outside the barracks.
   Some Red army troops are determined to stay in the wealthy West.
Officially, 53 Soviet soldiers have asked for asylum in Germany,
but the number is believed to be higher since it takes weeks and
sometimes months to register cases.

   The country's two most populous republics signed
their own trade pact Monday, while a new secessionist movement
emerged in Russia in the latest signs of Soviet fragmentation, news
reports said.
   Russian republic President Boris N. Yeltsin and Ukrainian
President Leonid Kravchuk signed a 10-year agreement Monday
recognizing each other's autonomy from the Kremlin. They also
promised to develop direct Ukrainian-Russian ties in fields ranging
from politics to science and technology.
   Yeltsin reiterated that the new union treaty, proposed by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to create a new federation of the 15
republics, must be a voluntary agreement by autonomous states.
   ``We cannot wait for a treaty and idle away the time. Everyone
is waiting for some impulse. I believe the agreement between the
two equal sovereign states ... is such an impulse,'' Yeltsin told
reporters, according to the official news agency Tass.
   Russia and the Ukraine together comprise 200 million of the
country's 285 million people. The Ukraine is the country's
traditional breadbasket, while Russia possess the bulk of the
Soviet Union's raw material on two-thirds of the nation's
territory.
   Yeltsin also challenged Gorbachev's statement last week that
republics should be wary of letting Russia gain too much power.
   ``We resolutely denounce the statement that Russia is claiming
for itself a key role and that the center is shifting to Russia. On
the contrary ... we have shown our desire to build relations on an
equality basis,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, in the southwestern corner of the Russian republic,
the Karachayevo-Cherkess autonomous region declared itself a
republic within Russia, according to the independent Postfactum
news agency.
   The region, about 225 miles northwest of Tbilisi, has about
370,000 people. The Karachay, the largest group, are a
Turkic-speaking people, but Postfactum did not say what their
complaints are.
   The region will continue to abide by Russian republic laws until
its main ethnic groups - Karachays, Cherkess, Abazin and Nogay -
create a federation of four smaller republics, Postfactum said.

Bush-Gorbachev meeting; trims to tighten.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Leaders of 34 nations toasted the end of Cold War
rivalries Monday in a celebration tarnished by distant military
rumbles from the Middle East. President Bush and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev grappled for a common strategy on the possible
use of force to oust Iraq from Kuwait.
   In capping a long-awaited East-West agreement to reduce forces
and troop levels in Europe, Bush said the treaties and testimonials
of Paris would be undermined ``if the rule of law is shamelessly
disregarded elsewhere.''
   He met over dinner with Gorbachev, who has been preaching
patience while the White House has been working to gather support
for a new United Nations resolution that would endorse the use of
force is sanctions fail to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush and Gorbachev
had ``a conceptual agreement that force cannot be ruled out.''
   However, Gorbachev has been emphasizing the search for a
peaceful solution.
   ``I think we all need patience but that does not mean that we
are going to weaken or retreat'' from earlier U.N. resolutions
calling for an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal, Gorbachev said at a
picture-taking session before dinner.
   Behind the scenes, Bush sought support from those attending the
European summit for a proposed U.N. resolution authorizing military
force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   ``It is time to discuss this matter further in the United
Nations Security Council,'' Fitzwater said. ``We continue
consultations with our friends and allies on this issue and we will
continue to work with them in the security council framework.''
   Reacting to reports that Iraq was nearly doubling its forces in
occupied Kuwait, Fitzwater said it was ``another instance of him
(Saddam) thumbing his nose at the United nations.'' He sought to
minimize differences between the two leaders on the issue of force,
saying they both favored a ``peaceful solution to this crisis.''
   A proposed joint news conference by the two superpower leaders
was cancelled. Fitzwater said the cancellation did not reflect a
new snag, but said that it was late in the day and both leaders
decided against it.
   ``They both simply felt it had been a long day,'' Fitzwater
said.
   ``We are united on this issue,'' Fitzwater told reporters in a
joint briefing with Gorbachev's new spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko.
``We have a conceptual agreement that force cannot be ruled out.''
   Ignatenko said that additional Iraqi troops in Kuwait gave the
Gulf situation a ``dangerous character.''
   ``We once again stated, and it was underlined, that it is
necessary to curtail aggression, and everything needs to return to
the condition that existed before the aggression against and the
annexation of Kuwait.
   ``Both sides once again agreed that it was necessary to return
to the Security Council, to once again discuss thoroughly this
problem,'' the Soviet spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said the leaders discussed the circumstances that
might prompt a military offensive against Iraq, but added, ``We
simply have not reached the point of decision yet.''
   Earlier, in the ornate French presidential residence, the Elysee
Palace, leaders of 16 NATO members and the remaining six Warsaw
Pact nations signed two treaties - one making sweeping cuts in
non-nuclear arms throughout Europe and the other pledging
non-aggression toward one another.
   Then, the 22 representatives of the two military alliances
joined leaders of neutral and unaligned countries to begin an
unprecedented 34-nation summit on the future of Europe. ``What a
long way the world has come,'' Gorbachev declared.
   A mark of just how far the world had come is the alliance
between Bush and Gorbachev against Iraq.
   Even as the leaders met to discuss peace in Europe, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein indicated that he would send an additional
250,000 troops to Kuwait, nearly doubling the occupation force in
the oil-rich emirate. The buildup, announced by the Iraqi News
Agency, apparently was in response to Bush's decision to augment
the 230,000 U.S. forces now in the Persian Gulf region by another
200,000 military personnel.
   Fitzwater said the new Iraqi deployment was ``another instance
of him (Saddam) thumbing his nose at the United nations.''
   Both Bush and Gorbachev renewed appeals for Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait.
   Bush sought to deflect questions over differences with
Gorbachev. He told reporters before the dinner, ``I'm very pleased
with the way the Soviet Union and the United States can work
together in the United Nations. There continues to be very
open-minded communications and I have no reason to be anything
other than very satisfied.''
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker reportedly was
considering a trip later this week to Yemen and beyond. Yemen is
the only Arab nation on the U.N. Security Council and has in the
past shown sympathy for Iraq. It will assume the council's rotating
presidency in December.
   Baker already was scheduled to go next weekend to Colombia to
confer with President Cesar Gaviria. Last weekend, Baker met with
the foreign ministers of eight members of the 15-nation council.
   The crisis in the Middle East sounded a distant discordant
drumbeat as leaders of nearly all nations in Europe and North
America saluted the democratic changes that have swept through
Europe in recent years.
   French President Francois Mitterrand formally opened the
34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. ``Our
meeting today marks the end of an epoch and thereby a beginning,''
he declared. ``It is the first time in history that we witness a
change in depth of our landscape which is not the outcome of a war
or bloody revolution.''
   The centerpiece of the summit, the Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe (CFE) treaty, calls for the destruction or removal of
thousands of tanks, artillery pieces, combat vehicles and attack
aircraft from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains deep inside the
Soviet Union.
   By so doing, it will alter the military balance in Europe by
erasing Moscow's ability to mass huge numbers of tanks and other
heavy armor in central Europe.
   The other treaty is a ``non-aggression'' pact in which the
members of the two alliances declare they are ``no longer
adversaries'' and will ``refrain from the threat or use of force''
against each other.
   Bush called the CFE treaty ``the farthest-reaching arms
agreement in history and it signals the new world order that is
emerging.''
   Yet he cautioned, ``Our success here can be neither profound nor
enduring if the rule of law is shamelessly disregarded elsewhere.''
   French authorities imposed tight security around the
unprecedented summit. Sharpshooters were placed on rooftops,
anti-terrorist units were mobilized and 10,000 police officers
fanned out throughout the city.
   With each of the 34 government leaders having separate
motorcades, traffic was frequently snarled.
   Bush is seeking backing for a United Nations resolution
authorizing military action to force Iraq out of Kuwait. He told
the leaders that principles of peace and self determination being
enshrined in Paris ``are grossly violated in the Persian Gulf.''
   One allied leader he didn't ave to persuade was British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher. After a breakfast meeting with Bush,
Mrs. Thatcher reiterated her willingness to use force to pry Saddam
from Kuwait.
   ``Most people understand that evil has to be stopped. Either he
withdraws or the military option has to be used,'' she said on the
eve of a conservative party challenge to her continued leadership.

   Rain, snow and high winds swept the Pacific Northwest and parts
of the Northeast on Monday, but dry conditions prevailed over much
of the rest of the nation.
   A winter storm warning was in effect Monday night into Tuesday
for the Cascade Mountains and Olympic Mountains of Washington
state, and a winter storm watch was posted for the Blue Mountains
and northeastern sections of the state.
   More than a foot of new snow was expected to fall at elevations
above 3,000 feet in the Olympic and Cascade ranges.
   Winds at Bellingham, Wash., gusted to 52 mph Monday, and a gale
warning is in effect along the coast of Washington state.
   A winter storm watch also was in effect for Monday night and
Tuesday morning for parts of Idaho, Montana west of the Continental
Divide, and the western mountains of Wyoming. A winter storm watch
has been posted for Tuesday for the mountains of Utah.
   Showers were scattered over western Washington state and
northwest Oregon. A weak storm system continued to produce light
rain over the eastern half of New England Monday. Snow, sleet and
freezing rain were over northern Maine. Snowfall totals of 3 to 6
inches were expected in northern Maine before the snow changed to
sleet and freezing rain.
   Gale warnings remain in effect along the coast of Maine, New
Hampshire and Massaschusetts.
   Elkins, W.Va., was the cold spot in the Lower 48 states with a
record cold reading of 14 degrees.

   Sen. Dennis DeConcini directed a fiery attack
Monday at the Ethics Committee's special counsel, accusing him of
relying on ``lies and allegations and hearsay'' to build a case
that the Arizona Democrat improperly assisted former savings and
loan operator Charles H. Keating Jr.
   DeConcini abandoned his normally low-key style and often raised
his voice to a shout as he denied wrongdoing and defiantly said of
lawyer Robert S. Bennett: ``He stands here as a prosecutor. ... He
wants a victory. He wants to nail somebody.''
   Bennett ``wants another trophy on the wall,'' said DeConcini. He
was the last senator to give his opening statement in the Ethics
Committee hearings into allegations that the ``Keating Five''
intervened for the businessman because of the $1.3 million he
contributed to their campaigns and causes.
   Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., John McCain, R-Ariz., John Glenn,
D-Ohio and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., all denied impropriety -
often emotionally - on Friday.
   ``The issue in this case is not me,'' Bennett retorted when
given a chance to speak later in the day. ``The issue in this case
is the conduct of the senators. That is what has brought them
here.''
   The lawyer also ridiculed suggestions by Cranston, DeConcini and
Riegle that he was holding them to non-existant Senate standards of
conduct.
   ``The greatest deliberative body in the whole world - you can't
hack it under my standards? These are not my standards,'' Bennett
said. ``These are your standards.''
   He also said the experienced defense lawyers in the case know
that ``when you don't like the law, you go after the opposing
lawyer. When you don't like the message, you burn the messenger.''
   The third day of hearings ended after Bennett called his first
witness, McCain staffer Gwendolyn van Paasschen. She backed
McCain's testimony that he refused to negotiate with regulators for
Keating, prompting Keating to call the senator a ``wimp.''
   The Ethics Committee, three Democratic and three Republican
Senate colleagues of the five lawmakers being investigated, could
recommend that the full Senate approve punishment such as
reprimands - or it could recommend at the end of the hearings that
no action be taken against some or all of the five.
   Keating was the chairman of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan,
of Irvine, Calif., and made many of his contributions while trying
unsuccessfully to keep the government from seizing his thrift. The
S&amp;L's parent company is based in Arizona, DeConcini and McCain's
home state.
   Lincoln's collapse is expected eventually to cost taxpayers $2
billion.
   DeConcini said he intervened for Keating with banking regulators
in April 1987 because he believed the businessman had ``a
legitimate beef'' with the federal government. Constituents, he
said, ``have a right to ask for your intervention'' because
bureaucrats ``often are wrong'' and ``somebody ought to stand up''
for them.
   ``I've never been bought,'' DeConcini said, adding that
Bennett's evidence, presented last week, ``contains hearsay ...
contains rumors, unfounded allegations about all of the senators.''
   ``Information has been left out and distorted. I hope you find
in your conscience there's something grossly unfair. What is wrong
with intervention for someone who contributes to your campaign?
Nothing.''
   Last week, Bennett suggested that DeConcini and Cranston were
most deeply involved with Keating.
   Evidence shows DeConcini ``was asked repeatedly to perform
services for Charles Keating, and that Senator DeConcini almost
always honored Mr. Keating's request,'' Bennett said.
   DeConcini also contended that Bennett was giving the only
Republican among the five, McCain, preferential treatment.
   He said Bennett had failed to ask McCain about his wife's
investment in a shopping center with Keating, and to press him on
vacation trips McCain and his family took on Keating's airplanes.
Bennett mentioned both last week but dismissed them as without
serious consequence to the case.
   Bennett, in unreleased but widely reported recommendations, has
proposed that McCain and Glenn be dropped from the investigation
while the probe be intenstified for the other three.
   McCain has said his wife's investments were separate from his.
He also belatedly paid for trips on Keating's plane and notified
the Ethics Committee of his action. No action was taken by the
panel.
   DeConcini also said that federal regulators waited for two years
to criticize the senators' intervention and that they complained
only after ``the savings and loan crisis was coming down on their
heads. They had a conscience problem'' because of their failure to
properly regulate failing thrifts, the senator contended.
   He invoked the name of Mother Teresa to indicate that when he
intervened for Keating the thrift operator had a stellar reputation
as the largest home builder in Arizona.
   DeConcini said when he met Mother Teresa, the Nobel prize winner
for her work for the poor, the first thing she asked was ``How is
my friend Charlie Keating?'' The senator said Keating was ``a
different person than he is perceived today.''
   The senator said he never negotiated for Keating with banking
regulators.
   ``I wanted responsiveness from the regulators. I wanted some
answers,'' he said. ``The special counsel says I was negotiating.
There's no rule that says you can't negotiate (but) I wasn't
negotiating,'' merely ``trying to get the government to respond ...
to a legitimate complaint of a constituent.''
   He complained that he was being forced to counter ``derogatory
information, lies and allegations and hearsay that Mr. Bennett goes
out and gets people to give.''
   He said that Common Cause, the private group that brought the
initial complaint that triggered the probe, did so as a
fund-raising tool.
   Ms. van Paasschen testified that she and McCain thought
DeConcini had agreed to limit the agenda at a crucial meeting
between four senators and the top thrift regulator, Edwin J. Gray,
on April 2, 1987.
   The testimony is important because DeConcini denied there was
any such limitation. Bennett said the evidence shows that DeConcini
went beyond any such agreement and offered a deal on Keating's
behalf to Gray.
   DeConcini, McCain and the two other senators present denied that
any quid pro quo for Gray was offered.

<HEAD>Newly Found Letters Offer Insight Into Early American Explorers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLEN G. BREED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A long-hidden cache of personal letters
unveiled Monday should give historians new insight into one of the
leaders of the famed Lewis and Clark expedition that explored the
northern Plains and the Northwest.
   The 47 letters from Capt. William Clark - five of them written
during the 1803-1806 expedition into the newly acquired Louisiana
Territory - are a ``tremendous find,'' said James R. Bentley,
executive director of the Filson Club, the Louisville historical
repository that now owns the letters.
   Among the more important illuminations are Clark's thoughts on
the mysterious death in 1809 of expedition commander Meriwether
Lewis and his opinion of the treacherous Aaron Burr, vice president
under Thomas Jefferson, whose $15 million Louisiana Purchase
doubled the nation's size.
   The letters, dated from 1792 to 1811, are addressed to Gen.
Jonathan Clark, the explorer's older brother. Until two years ago
the letters were hidden away in the Louisville attic of Clark's
descendants.
   Some historians have argued that Lewis, then governor of the
territory he helped explore and map, was murdered on his way to
Washington, D.C., but Clark's letters support the theory that his
friend killed himself.
   ``Clark clearly indicates in his letters that he believed Lewis
was in an unstable state of mind and was very capable of committing
suicide,'' said James J. Holmberg, curator of manuscripts for the
Filson Club.
   In one letter, Clark calls Lewis a ``poor fellow'' who was
``much distressed'' about how the public might perceive his
handling of financial matters in the territory.
   Holmberg said that in another letter Clark tells how Lewis had
asked him and others to help sell his property and settle his debts
shortly before his death.
   References to Burr, perhaps best known for killing Treasury
Secretary Alexander Hamilton in a duel, turn up frequently in the
correspondence.
   The references focus on Burr's alleged attempts to raise an army
and overthrow the government. In his letters, Clark refers to Burr
as a ``second Napoleon,'' Holmberg said.
   ``He told President Jefferson that Burr was a real danger and
that something needs to be done about him,'' Holmberg said. ``And
something was. He was arrested.''
   The letters will force revision of several biographies, Holmberg
said, including that of Clark's slave, York, who accompanied the
group on the excursion.
   Holmberg said a 1985 book about York - ``In Search of York,'' by
Robert Betts - was extremely thorough. But he said new information
in the letters explains some important events in York's life, such
as how Clark's refusal to reunite York with his slave wife caused
an irreparable rift between the two men.
   The Clark descendants just recently completed the legal process
of turning the documents over to the Filson Club, which now owns
six of the 12 existing letters Clark wrote during the expedition.
The six others are scattered in other collections. The Filson Club
would not disclose what it paid for the letters.
   Winifred George of St. Louis, incoming president of the
1,500-member, Montana-based Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage
Foundation, said it was a ``wonderful'' find.
   ``It's been some years since something new has been
discovered,'' George said. ``We often forget how important that
expedition was to the entire westward development,'' she said.
   Bentley acknowledged that the documents won't exactly rewrite
the history books, but said they offer illuminating details.
   ``What struck me most was the insight on William Clark ... It
shows a side of him that would hard to find otherwise,'' he said.

<HEAD>Angola Peace Talks Said to be Deadlocked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peace talks between the Angolan
government and U.S.-backed UNITA rebels were deadlocked Monday and
a rebel negotiator broke a gag rule to criticize the government's
position.
   ``What's happened so far is unhappily very little, almost
nothing, because of the manifest lack of political will on one
side,'' rebel spokesman Norberto de Castro said.
   ``The situation is not bright,'' said a Portuguese Foreign
Ministry official. ``But things are not as bad as has been said.''
   Portugal is mediating the talks aimed at ending a 15-year civil
war that by government count has taken 340,000 lives. Delegations
from the United States and the Soviet Union, which arm the opposing
sides, are atending the talks as observers.
   Both sides had agreed not to comment on the talks while they
were in progress, but de Castro said Portuguese news media had
unfairly blamed the rebels for the deadlock in the talks, which
began Friday in Estoril, a coastal resort 16 miles west of Lisbon.
   The negotiations appeared to be stalled over the timing of the
merging of the two armies and the government's recognition of UNITA
as a legitimate political force.
   The Angolan government proposes the integration of the two
armies before multiparty elections. UNITA wants elections first.
   The government is also reluctant to recognize UNITA until a
cease-fire is signed.
   UNITA, the Portuguese initials of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, and the governing Popular Movement
for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA, were rival factions in the
independence struggle against Portugal.
   When Portugal granted Angola independence in 1975, the MPLA
entered triumphantly into Luanda. UNITA continued to fight them.

<HEAD>Study Shows Beef Can Be Part of Lean Diet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN FAHLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study has demonstrated that lean beef can be
safely substituted for poultry or fish in a low-cholesterol diet,
but the nutritionist who did the study cautioned that doesn't mean
burgers and chicken-fried steak.
   Lynne Scott, assistant professor at the Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston, said her study of 46 men with borderline high
cholesterol found that lean beef can be as effective as lean
chicken or fish in a low-cholesterol diet.
   ``There's no reason that they couldn't eat beef as long as they
stipulate it is a very lean beef in a low-fat diet,'' Ms. Scott
said. ``It must be with that stipulation, however. Otherwise,
immediately people start thinking of hamburgers, lasagna and
chicken-fried steak and that's not what we're talking about.''
   The study findings will be published in the January edition of
Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Disease journal, Ms. Scott
said. Last week, she presented her findings in an abstract at the
American Heart Association's 63rd annual convention in Dallas.
   Ms. Scott put the 46 men, whose cholesterol levels were between
200 and 250 milligrams per deciliter of blood, on the low-fat,
low-cholesterol diet recommended by the American Heart Association.
That diet has less than 30 percent of calories derived from fat and
less than 10 percent from saturated fat.
   Half of the group ate 8 ounces of beef daily with less than 4
percent fat, while the other half ate 4 ounces of red snapper and 4
ounces of skinless chicken breast.
   After four weeks, the overall cholesterol levels of both groups
declined by the same amount and there was no statistically
significant difference in their cholesterol levels.
   Ms. Scott said the finding supports allowing more variety in
such diets, but she emphasized the beef had to be extra lean and
cooked without additional fats.
   ``It was all steaks - strip steaks - with the fat trimmed
away,'' she said. ``It's not hamburger. That isn't graded in the
same way that whole meat is.''
   She said the study showed ``if a person is going to use beef, he
should use the select grade and he needs to trim off all of the
fat.''
   The findings did not surprise Dr. Robert Lees, professor of
cardiovascular disease at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   ``It's kind of an old finding, really,'' he said. ``I think
there has been a lot of emotion involved in each new dietary
finding and people lose track of exactly what they are talking
about.
   ``Certainly lean beef, if it's truly lean, is probably not very
different in terms of its metabolic effect than poultry, which has
more fat than people realize,'' Lees said.
   Dr. Louis Rakita, professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, said that while the study's results are
valid, he questioned whether the public would eat the same amount
of meat as did the study subjects.
   ``There is nothing inappropriate about the result of that study.
The question is can people eat a small enough amount of meat,''
said Rakita, a member of the American Heart Association's task
force on cholesterol.
   ``Under the strict control of her experiment, I think the
results are understandable,'' he said. ``I think her
recommendations are appropriate, provided you can stick to the
standards of her experiment.''
   Ms. Scott now is researching the effects on subjects with high
cholesterol ``to see if the source of the fat makes a difference.''
The second study is expected to be completed sometime next year.

<HEAD>Shamir Defends Call for Keeping Occupied Lands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, defending a
speech that stirred anger in Israel and abroad, denied Monday he
had meant to say the occupied lands should be kept to house Soviet
immigrants.
   Shamir made the controversial speech Sunday night at a memorial
service for dead politicians from his right-wing Likud bloc. He
said: ``The party leaders left us a clear message to keep the land
of Israel from the sea to the Jordan River for future generations
and for the mass immigration and for the Jewish people, most of
whom will be gathered into this country.''
   Egypt on Monday accused Shamir of ``expansionist intentions.''
Israeli legislators from the left accused Shamir of jeopardizing
immigration by suggesting he wants to settle Soviet Jews in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   On Monday, Shamir said he had been defining two of his dreams.
He said there was no linkage between his wish for ``a greater
Israel'' and the question of Soviet immigration.
   ``My message was first, the land of Israel from the sea to the
river, and second, a massive Jewish immigration from all parts of
the world in order to concentrate all the Jewish people, or the
majority of the Jewish people, in Israel,'' Shamir said on Israel
television.
   At least 120,000 Soviet Jews have arrived so far this year, and
1 million are expected by the end of 1992.
   In January, Shamir created another political storm by telling a
party gathering that ``for a large immigration, we need the land of
Israel, a large and strong Israel. We will need a lot of place to
absorb everybody.''
   Palestinian and Arab leaders immediately launched a campaign to
block immigration of thousands of Soviet Jews. The Arabs fear the
immigrants will displace Palestinians in the occupied lands.
   Israel captured the territories in the 1967 Middle East War from
Jordan and Egypt. Palestinians have been waging a nearly 3-year
uprising aimed at freeing the land from Israeli control.
   The United States has repeatedly called for a land-for-peace
settlement in the region. It has insisted on Israeli guarantees
that U.S.-backed loans for the Soviet immigrants not be used in the
occupied lands or Arab east Jerusalem.
   In Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismat Abdel-Meguid on Monday
summoned Israel's ambassador to explain Shamir's remark. His
ministry issued a statement saying: ``Egypt rejects in its totality
... Shamir's comments which indicate his expansionist intention to
occupy territories belonging to someone else and this cannot help
reach a peaceful settlement to the Palestinian issue.''
   Speaking in the Israeli Parliament, Yair Tzaban, head of the
socialist Mapam Party, asked Shamir why he couldn't keep his
thoughts to himself.
   ``Why can't you restrain your ideological thoughts? Where will
your tongue take us?'' he asked.
   Chaim Ramon, head of the left-of-center Labor Party faction in
Parliament, criticized Shamir's comment on Israel radio: ``I am
calling on the prime minister to be quiet, for heaven's sake. He is
risking the chances of immigration.''

<TEXT>
   Now that Atlanta has the 1996 Summer Games in the
bag, a local men's club has launched a tongue-in-cheek campaign to
promote the city as host for the 1998 Winter Olympics.
   The Atlanta Millionaires Club has suggested activities including
slalom tractor pulls, snowmobile demolition derbies and contests to
determine who is most guilt-free about taking off from work because
of a few snow flurries.
   The temperature ``didn't stop us from getting the summer
Olympics,'' lawyer Tully Hazell, chairman of the winter events
committee, said Monday. ``We can't think small here.''
   Billy Payne, who put together Atlanta's winning proposal to be
host for the 1996 Summer Games, will serve as honorary chairman for
the group's unofficial kickoff for the 1998 bid Dec. 1.
   Donations collected during the kickoff will go to The Howard
Schools, which help those with learning disabilities in Atlanta.
   Hazell said the club would not let Atlanta's winter temperatures
with average highs in the 60s be a deterrent to the Olympic quest.
   ``Once we put our climate issue behind us, I think Atlanta has a
lot of things to offer as the site of the Winter Games,'' Hazell
said. ``First of all, it's generally pretty warm here in February,
so you probably won't have to get all bundled up when you go out to
watch the events.''
   Backup plans call for tobacco spitting and cow tipping contests.
   Payne said the Atlanta Millionaires Club has about 50 members.
   ``We have a very select but diverse membership,'' he said. ``The
way I would describe it is if you were at your wife's or
girlfriend's Christmas parties, we would be the guys that would be
standing around the bar.''

<HEAD>Government, University Scientists Develop Superconducting
Transistor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD EGGLESTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government and University of Wisconsin
reseachers have developed the world's first high-temperature
superconducting transistor, a device some hope will improve future
generations of electronic equipment.
   While superconductive compounds that function at the relatively
warm temperatures of liquid nitrogen have been developed in the
past few years, this new device is the first to use those materials
to create a transistor.
   The Superconducting Flux Flow Transistor was developed at the
University of Wisconsin and Sandia National Laboratories in
Albuquerque, N.M., at the direction of Jon Martens, a UW-Madison
graduate, and electrical engineering professors James E. Nordman
and James B. Beyer.
   The Department of Energy backed the project.
   ``We have taken the device and coupled it with passive microwave
components to make real circuits that have exciting potential,''
said Dr. David Ginley, supervisor of semiconductor research at
Sandia.
   Transistors function as switches that control electrical
current. They also are used to amplify signals from devices ranging
from stereos to communication satellites. Some early ones were the
size of coins but others are so small a computer chip may contain
hundreds.
   Superconductivity, the loss of all resistance to electrical
currents, occurs in certain materials when they are chilled by
liquid helium to minus 452 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature near
absolute zero.
   Devices that are superconductive at higher, more economical
temperatures are a key to the electronic industry's quest to make
faster computers, lower-noise microwave components and other
improved products.
   The superconducting transistor is etched in a thin film of
thalium and copper oxide and operates at a much warmer temperature
of minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit, that of liquid nitrogen, which is
considerably less expensive than liquid helium.
   The new transistor intrigues scientists partly because it
functions differently than conventional transistors made of
materials like silicon and gallium arsenide.
   Conventional transistors use voltage alterations to control
electrical current. The new transistor uses current changes to
control the voltage.
   Ken Frazier, a spokesman at Sandia, said the new transistor may
serve as a bridge between solid-state electronic circuitry that
functions at room temperatures and future circuitry operating at
superconductivity temperatures.
   But Nordman, one of the supervising engineers, cautioned that
scientists are still studying the device's properties and are far
from determining its specific application.
   ``The transistor was invented in 1948, and we've been learning
about it ever since,'' Nordman said.

   A military court sentenced reserve army Maj.
Ilan Hauser to 45 days in jail Monday and demoted him to second
lieutenant for starting a riot in an Arab village that left one
Palestinian dead, army radio said.
   Hauser was also given a six-month suspended sentence, the radio
said, adding he would be allowed to serve his sentence doing work
on the army base instead of behind bars.
   The incident occurred last December when Hauser led his company
of reservists into El Janiya in the occupied West Bank, 11 miles
northwest of Jerusalem, following repeated stonings of Israeli
cars.
   Israel radio said that without authorization, Hauser gathered
the villagers in the main square for a discussion and then suddenly
threw a stun grenade into the crowd. A riot broke out during which
a Palestinian, Farej Abu Fahida, was shot to death.
   Also Monday, the civil administration began distributing
restrictive identity cards to about 2,400 West Bank Palestinians
who are said to pose a security risk or have a criminal record. The
card permanently bars its holder from visiting or working in
Israel.
   Issuance of the new cards will bring to 10,000 the number Arabs
from the occupied territories who are blocked from Israel.

   Arab nations on Monday abandoned their
eight-year drive to oust Israel from the United Nations, but they
said they do not recognize Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem or
the occupied territories.
   The decision followed a change of tactics by the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which wants to attach special conditions
on a vote expected later this month on Israel's credentials.
   Arab U.N. members began the drive to kick out Israel in 1982 but
have suffered increasingly wide defeats in annual votes.
   Arab nations have repeatedly challenged Israel's right to sit in
the General Assembly among other ``peace-loving states'' when the
credentials committee presented its report.
   The chairman of the Arab group for the month, Lebanese
Ambassador Khalil Makkawi, said the Arabs would move that Israel's
credentials be accepted so long as the Jewish state does not
represent ``Arab-occupied territories.''
   Those areas, according to the proposed amendment, are
``Jerusalem, Gaza, the West Bank and Golan Heights.''
   Israel captured Arab east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967
Middle East war and has annexed it. Israel claims Jerusalem as its
capital, and says it will never give the city up.
   Most countries reject Israel's annexation of Jerusalem,
preferring to push for a 1948 General Assembly plan that would have
made Israel an international city, and created two countries -
Israel and Palestine.
   Israel recognizes the West Bank and Gaza Strip as occupied, and
has expressed willingness to negotiate over some of that land in
bilateral talks with its neighbors.
   Normally, acceptance of credentials is an automatic, technical
affair; if a country's foreign minister signs a diplomat's
credentials, the delegate is accepted.
   Israel's U.N. Mission said it rejected any approach to Israel's
credentials that singles out the Jewish state with any special
conditions.
   The Arab approach to the credentials issue is being called the
``Portuguese formula,'' after an approach African nations took to
Portugal's U.N. membership in 1973, when it still had African
colonies.
   The General Assembly voted that year to accept Portugal's
credentials on the condition that Portugal did not represent its
African colonies, which were then fighting liberation wars against
Lisbon.
   The United States, Britain and other European nations oppose the
Arab approach to the Israel situation.
   They say that a technical issue, such as proper credentials,
should not be converted into a political debate, and unsuccessfully
tried to persuade the Arabs to limit themselves to critical
speeches on the floor of the General Assembly.
   The United States and other Western countries are expected to
vote against setting special conditions on Israel, but if they lose
that vote, to vote in favor of accepting the entire credentials
report covering all delegations.
   That is how America and Britain voted in 1973 on the Portugal
issue.
   Several weeks ago, the Palestine Liberation Organization
proposed dropping the challenge to Israel's credentials and instead
voting in favor of Israel, but with conditions.
   The PLO proposed that Israel be accepted on the condition that
it obey Security Council resolutions rejecting the Jewish state's
annexation of Jerusalem.
   Arab states eventually decided that that approach was too
legally tangled and opted for the ``Portuguese formula.''
   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was immersed in a
furor over remarks he made Sunday about the occupied lands. He had
said Likud leaders of the past had ``left us a clear message to
keep the land of Israel from the sea to the Jordan River for future
generations and for the mass immigration and for the Jewish people,
most of whom will be gathered into this country.''
   On Monday, he denied he meant to say the occupied lands should
be kept to accommodate Soviet immigrants. He told Israeli
television: ``My message was first, the land of Israel from the sea
to the river, and second, a massive Jewish immigration from all
parts of the world in order to concentrate all the Jewish people,
or the majority of the Jewish people, in Israel.''
   Egypt and left-wing Israeli legislators condemned the initial
remarks.

   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile
said Monday he opposes any new treaty keeping U.S. military bases
here and that such a treaty would never gain the necessary votes in
the Philippines Senate.
   In a speech at Manila's University of the East, Enrile said the
Philippines cannot puruse an independent foreign policy if the U.S.
military facilities remain on its soil.
   The United States maintains the giant Clark Air Base, Subic Bay
Naval Base and four smaller installations under a 1947 agreement
that expires in September 1991.
   The Philippine Constitution requires a treaty approved by
two-thirds of the 23-member Senate to keep the facilities beyond
1991. Manila and Washington on Nov. 9 ended a second round of talks
on a new treaty.
   Enrile, a former defense secretary, said he and 11 other
senators have signed a resolution opposing any extension of the
bases' stay. At least 16 signatures are need to pass any new bases
treaty, Enrile said.
   ``We must pursue ... an independent foreign policy, and this we
cannot attain unless we do away with the military bases
agreement,'' Enrile said.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said recently that Manila would
take over Clark and the four facilities, but was willing to extend
U.S. use of the Subic facility for five to seven years.
   Washington has said it wants to retain access and a limited
troop presence for 10 to 12 years.

   Iraq will send 250,000 more troops to
Kuwait, giving it a military superiority in the Persian Gulf
standoff that ``others cannot match,'' the official Iraqi News
Agency reported Monday.
   It said President Saddam Hussein and his military commanders met
and decided to send seven extra divisions of the regular army and
an additional 150,000 reserves and draftees.
   The announcement, monitored in Cyprus, came 11 days after
President Bush announced a U.S. buildup in the gulf to about
430,000 military personnel, expected to be completed in January.
   No indication emerged as to where the extra regular Iraqi troops
would come from. Iraq's army - totaling 55 divisions of 555,000
regular troops and 480,000 reserves - already was believed to have
430,000 men in southern Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``It is worth mentioning that according to military
considerations, the percentage of attacking force to defending
force is three to one,'' INA said.
   ``This means the United States will need to mobilize a
3-million-strong force with similar equipment and armament to our
forces'' if it is to attack, the agency went on.
   ``The superiority will thus remain at its required standard,
which the others cannot match.''
   Iraq's regular army includes seven divisions of the elite
Republican Guards, totaling about 120,000 men. These troops formed
the spearhead of Iraq's offensives in the closing stages of the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war in which Iranian-held Iraqi territory was
recaptured. They also led the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   In Kuwait, Iraq already has an estimated 10 divisions - three
armored, two mechanized infantry, four infantry and one commando -
totaling 170,000 troops, with about 1,500 T-55 and T-62 tanks.
   A further 15-16 divisions totaling about 250,000 men, including
at least six Republican Guard divisions with up to 1,800 tanks,
including all Iraq's T-72s, and approximately 750 guns are dug in
in southern Iraq south of Basra straddling the Kuwaiti border.
   Five more divisions, totaling 20,000 men, are believed to be
spread along the Saudi Arabia border, many in the sector near
Kuwait.
   The multinational force of about 350,000 troops in the gulf
region includes 240,000 Americans. An estimated 170,000 ground
troops, 46,000 Navy personnel and 30,000 Air Force personnel are
deployed in northeastern Saudi Arabia around Dhahran and the bulk
of the kingdom's oilfields.
   Bush announced Nov. 8 he has ordered more U.S. forces into the
gulf region and said the planned rotation of troops already
deployed in Saudi Arabia has been scrapped.
   Iraqi officials have claimed the increases expose U.S.
intentions from the beginning to attack Iraq, instead of to defend
Saudi Arabia as Bush said originally.
   INA reported earlier Monday that Iraqi Defense Minister
Abdul-Jabbar Shanshal condemned a statement by Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney that ``foreign forces in Saudi Arabia under U.S.
command are capable to defeat Iraqi forces if they want.''
   ``Such statements involve big risks. Cheney will discover but
before it is too late that his wrong calculation and his attempts
to bluff involved him in an impasse,'' INA said.

<HEAD>Chinese Doctor Claims `Revolutionary' Treatment for Burns</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese physician said Monday he will
seek a U.S. patent for a herbal ointment he claims can greatly
reduce the pain and healing time of patients with serious burns.
   Officials at Hackensack Medical Center said they hope to conduct
clinical trials of Dr. Xu Rongxiang's ointment once it is patented
and they learn what's in it.
   Other burn experts said they would have to see proof before
accepting the claims made by Xu, director of China's Science and
Technology Center of Burns, Wounds and Surface Ulcers.
   Dr. Anthony Barbara, chief of pediatric surgery at Hackensack
Medical Center, said he saw the benefits of Xu's treatment during a
visit to China last year.
   ``It does work, there's no question about it,'' Barbara said
during a news conference with Xu at the hospital. ``How it works
we'd have to find out.''
   Until laboratory, animal and human trials are conducted, it's
too early to judge whether the ointment represents improvement over
current treatment, said Dr. Fred Caldwell of the University of
Arkansas School of Medicine, president of the American Burn
Association.
   ``What we have here are claims, but they're a little short on
documentation,'' Caldwell said in a telephone interview from Little
Rock, Ark.
   ``I think everybody who works in this area has to have an open
mind for new treatments,'' he said. ``On the other hand, I think
you couldn't be less than really objective in the evaluation. We've
had too many false starts.''
   His skepticism was echoed by Dr. Francis Nance, chairman of the
surgery department and director of the burn unit at St. Barnabas
Medical Center in Livingston.
   ``New formulas for topical treatment of burns are a dime a
dozen, they come and go,'' Nance said.
   Xu said he has used the treatment on 54,000 patients in China,
where he said the government approved testing in 1988. The
ointment, made from plants, is applied directly to burned skin.
   ``Our medicine has the property of reducing further injury of
the burn wound; it has the property of combating infection, and
thirdly the medicine can promote, or accelerate, the healing of
wounds,'' Xu said through an interpreter.
   Xu is in the United States to meet with burn experts and federal
health officials and to apply for a patent. He said he could not
describe the contents of his ointment until it is patented, and
neither he nor Barbara would speculate how long that might take.
   Tests would determine how the ointment acts on the skin, what
side effects it might have and what dosage is appropriate, Barbara
said. It could take seven to 10 years for the Food and Drug
Administration to approve the ointment for widespread use, he
added.
   Barbara and Harry J. Gaynor, president of the National Burn
Victim Foundation based in Orange, traveled to China a year ago and
met with Xu and several of his patients. Gaynor said they saw
newly-burned patients who appeared to be in little or no pain, and
former patients showing no signs of scarring despite having
suffered severe burns.
   ``I strongly feel that each and every day this ointment is not
available, that children and adults are suffering needlessly,''
Gaynor said.
   Barbara said the ointment would be particularly useful for
treating ``deep second-degree burns,'' involving blistering and
damage to the skin below the surface but not complete destruction
of the tissue.
   Xu said the ointment shortened treatment time for deep
second-degree burns to ``around 18-20 days.'' He and Barbara said
this represents about a one-third reduction in the time it takes
for such burns to heal, but Caldwell disagreed.
   ``That's what we expect now,'' Caldwell said. ``If a burn wound
isn't closed in 21 days, you'd like to close it with a skin
graft.''

   President Bush said Monday he was prepared to send
food to the Soviet Union ``during the bleak winter'' to help
preserve Mikhail S. Gorbachev's democratic reforms.
   ``We want to try to help with the evolution of market systems
and the evolution of the change that's taking place,'' Bush said
before a two-hour meeting with Gorbachev. ``And you also want to
help new friends when you find them if they're in jeopardy.''
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, meanwhile, said he and Gorbachev
already had agreed that Germany would send food, and rail shipments
could begin as early as next week.
   The Soviet Union has had bountiful harvests this year, but a
breakdown in distribution has led to more spoilage than usual. In
addition, many rural communities are holding back food shipments
for their own use or for barter.
   The Bush-Gorbachev talks focused on the Persian Gulf crisis, and
the two leaders emerged with a ``conceptual agreement'' that the
use of force to push Iraq out of Kuwait could not be ruled out,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Gorbachev, in his speech at the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, dwelt little on the political and economic
crisis facing his country, but warned that nationalist and
separatist forces threatened to undercut steps toward democracy and
a market economy in the Soviet bloc.
   ``It has been generally recognized that the historic shift,
occurring in the Soviet Union, away from the totalitarianism to
freedom and democracy ... to a state anchored in the rule of law
and political pluralism, from the state economic monopoly to a
diversity of equitable property ownership ... constitutes a major
change in the world,'' he said.
   But some people were failing to consider the well-being of
Europe overall and were practicing ``militant nationalism and
reckless separatism,'' he said, a clear allusion to efforts by some
Soviet republics to quit the union.
   ``They may spell conflicts, animosity, the `Balkanization' or
what would be worse the `Lebanization' of entire regions,'' he
said.
   Rising ethnic tensions and efforts to change Europe's post-1945
borders could have ``a destructive snowball effect'' if any
government gives way to them, he noted.
   ``A breakthrough in Soviet-American relations has been pivotal
in'' improving the international climate, he said,'' noting that it
was five years to the day since he held his first summit meeting
with then-President Ronald Reagan, beginning the thaw in
U.S.-Soviet ties.
   ``Our country has changed and will never be the same as it was
before,'' he added. ``We have opened up to the world and the world
has opened up in response.''
   ``No matter what difficulties the Soviet Union faces today, it
will remain a great European power, in line with its enormous
potential,'' Gorbachev said.
   In Washington, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt welcomed
Bush's comments on food aid and said they ``placed the United
States firmly on the side of democratization, peaceful change and
economic reform'' in the Soviet Union.
   Gephardt came under sharp criticism last March when he suggested
U.S. aid for the Soviet Union, particularly from Bush and other
Republicans who said such talk was premature.

   A 13-year-old leukemia victim whose father sought
unsuccessfully to have the boy's twin half siblings tested as
potential bone marrow donors died Monday.
   Jean-Pierre Bosze died at his home in suburban Hoffman Estates,
family attorney Edward Jordan said. His parents were at his
bedside.
   The boy's father, Tamas Bosze, had unsuccessfully sought a court
ruling to force Nancy Curran, his former girlfriend and the mother
of his 3-year-old twin son and daughter, to have the children
tested as possible donors of potentially life-saving bone marrow.
   Ms. Curran opposed the testing, saying it could be painful and
risky. The Supreme Court in September affirmed a lower court's
ruling in her favor.
   Meanwhile, Jean-Pierre's condition worsened and he was in and
out of the hospital over the last two months, Jordan said.
   The boy was released from Lutheran General Hospital in Park
Ridge last week and his death ``had been expected for some time,''
Jordan said.
   Ms. Curran's attorney extended her sympathy to the Bosze family
in a one-paragraph statement issued by her attorney.
   The twins were born while Bosze and Jean-Pierre's mother, to
whom he is still married, were separated. Ms. Curran had sole
custody of the twins.
   Bosze approached Ms. Curran about the possibility of the twins
being tested after tests showed he, the boy's mother, brother and
half-sister were all incompatible.
   He first petitioned the courts in June, saying the twins would
want to help their half brother if they were old enough to decide.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Monica Reynolds ruled Sept. 6 that
forcing the twins to take a blood test to determine whether they
could be marrow donors would violate their constitutional right to
privacy.
   Bone marrow donations can save people with leukemia and other
diseases if a donor with closely matching tissue types - usually a
relative - can be found.
   The marrow is extracted from the donor by inserting a long
needle into the hip or breast bone. Doctors said the procedure is
painful and donors risk infection, complications from undergoing
anaesthesia and the need for a blood transfusion because of a
substantial blood loss.

Arizonans pick their new governor Feb. 26, despite complaints by
Indian lawmakers that voters would likely be trapped at home by
heavy snow on reservation roads.
   The bill setting a date for a runoff election between
gubernatorial candidates Fife Symington and Terry Goddard was
approved by the Legislature and then signed by Gov. Rose Mofford.
   Symington, a Republican, edged Democrat Goddard 49.7 percent to
49.2 percent in the Nov. 6 election. State law requires that a
governor be elected by a majority of the votes cast.
   Rep. Benjamin Hanley, D-Window Rock, said he would file a formal
protest with the U.S. Justice Department, which must approve all
changes in Arizona election laws because of previous violations
involving Indian and other minority voters.
   ``I think the people up on the Navajo reservation will be
disenfranchised,'' Hanley told the House after his May 7 suggestion
was rejected.
   Symington received about 4,200 more votes than Goddard but fell
short of an absolute majority because minor candidates received
more than 11,000 write-in votes.
   Hanley's attempt to change the election date was not supported
by the Navajo board of elections, which told lawmakers in a letter
that it had no problem with the February date.
   But Rep. Jack Jackson, D-Window Rock, the only other Indian
member of the House, also voted against the bill, which cleared the
House 54-3.
   The measure passed the Senate 29-0 a short time later without
debate, and was then signed by the governor.
   In addition to setting the runoff date, the bill would suspend
state law requiring a purge of voting rolls after each general
election. That will guarantee that citizens can vote in the runoff
as long as they are registered at least 29 days before the runoff,
whether or not they voted Nov. 6.
   The bill provides for no write-in candidates, which irked Max
Hawkins, who came in third with more than 10,000 of the write-ins.
   Hawkins, a former aide of impeached Gov. Evan Mecham, said he
deserved to have his name on the runoff ballot and that ``the only
reason to deny it would be to favor the major party candidates.''
   But Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Leo Corbet, R-Phoenix,
told Hawkins that language in the 1988 constitutional amendment,
which established the new election rules, is clear in limiting the
election to the two top vote-getters in the general election.
   Other provisions of the runoff bill suspend
campaign-contribution limits to allow people who made maximum
contributions to the candidates during the general-election
campaign to donate again for the runoff, and appropriates $3
million to pay for the election.
   Voters added the runoff requirement in reaction to the 1986
gubernatorial election in which Mecham won a three-way race with 40
percent of the vote.
   Mecham was impeached and removed from office on charges of
misusing state money and obstructing justice in 1988 but ran again
this year, only to be defeated in the Republican primary.

   French Premier Michel Rocard on Monday night
narrowly survived a no-confidence vote in Parliament despite an
alliance of the normally friendly Communists with the opposition
conservatives.
   The motion's failure allowed Rocard to retain his post, though
the ninth and most serious challenge to his two-year-old government
left his future uncertain.
   The showdown vote came after a dispute over a tax reform bill.
But opposition leaders also attacked Rocard's handling of the huge
student protests that have shaken Paris and other cities the past
month.
   The opposition mustered 284 votes, five short of the absolute
majority needed in the 577-seat assembly to bring down Rocard's
government.
   Had Rocard lost, President Francois Mitterrand would have faced
the choice of dissolving Parliament for elections or naming a new
premier.
   The government feud occurred while officials of 34 nations
gathered in Paris signed a conventional arms reduction treaty and
discussed the post-Cold War order in Europe. Rocard and President
Francois Mitterrand represented France.
   The troubles of Rocard, 60, mirror a battle facing another
summit leader, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. She could
be toppled Tuesday in a challenge for the leadership of her
Conservative Party.
   The Communist Party, in an unprecedented break with the
Socialist government, had sided with three conservative groups in
Parliament to block social security tax reform.
   The result of the voting was announced by National Assembly
President Laurent Fabius, a former Socialist premier close to
Mitterrand who was the likely candidate to replace Rocard had the
motion gone through.
   Socialist lawmakers gave Rocard prolonged applause. The premier
thanked them for their votes and said he hoped parliamentary
business would continue smoothly.
   The censure's failure ``is not a victory for the government,''
insisted Andre Lajoinie, head of the Communist Party's group in
Parliament. ``They only lacked five votes. ... The government did
not win the match.''
   The three main right-wing parties - the Rally for the Republic
party, the Union for French Democracy and the Union of the Center -
filed the no-confidence motion Friday.
   The conservatives together control 260 seats, while the
Communists hold 26. The Socialists hold 272 seats, and 19 assembly
members are independent.
   While all but one Communist deputy voted for censure, several
conservatives defected, joining 14 independents in not approving
the motion.
   Charles Millon, the Union of the Center's leader in the National
Assembly, began the debate by saying Rocard's two years in power
had brought French society to a crisis.
   ``Our society has never seemed so divided, our youth so
anxiety-ridden, our state so weak,'' Millon said.
   ``The French expected much of you,'' Millon said. ``You have
deceived them. You have succeeded ... in making the streets the
most frequented pulpit in our country.''
   Rocard had proposed a 1.1 percent social security tax that would
replace part of the existing social security contributions paid by
employers and employees.
   The Communists and conservatives said the reform would levy
taxes on some previously exempt retired and unemployed people. They
also claim it could be raised in coming years.
   Rocard maintains the bill will streamline the tax system and
reduce the tax burden on most poor and middle-income people.
   The dispute was considered the biggest threat to Rocard since
Mitterrand named him prime minister after the Socialists regained
effective control of the National Assembly in 1988.
   Lacking an outright majority in the assembly, the Socialists
have relied in the past on abstentions by the Communists to defeat
conservative-sponsored censure motions. But the Communists had
pledged to vote to censure this time.
   ``It's the first time the Communist Party will have crossed the
yellow line,'' Fabius said before the vote.
   Fabius, 44, Rocard's chief Socialist rival, was forced out as
prime minister in 1986 after the Socialists lost parliamentary
elections.
   Rocard scored higher this year in public opinion polls than any
other French politician, but his current problems are exacerbated
by the tide of anti-government sentiment.

   A couple engaged in a week-old
``Breeders Cup'' race with other couples to conceive a child said
Monday they were expecting a baby.
   A doctor on Monday confirmed the positive results of a home
pregnancy test that showed James and Lisa Machamer would be
parents, said Scott Schubert, sales manager for radio station KRNQ,
which sponsored the race.
   The station will award the couple a $1,000 savings bond, a crib
and six months of a diaper service.
   ``I was shocked, excited,'' said Mrs. Machamer, 22. ``But we've
been trying for a while. I don't think the contest made any
difference; we didn't do anything different. That's the first
question everybody wants to know.''
   The Machamers, of Des Moines, were among about 20 married
couples without children who responded to the station's invitation
to participate in the ``Breeder's Cup'' promotion. Of those, three
couples were chosen by lot for the race that began a week ago.
   Although contestants talked on the radio about their efforts to
conceive, the station didn't get any complaints, Schubert said.
``If it's done with taste, you can do it,'' he said.
   Mrs. Machamer said she didn't know if she would participate
again in a promotion that revealed so much about her private life.
   ``I was on the radio this morning, we're going to be on the
radio in Peoria this afternoon, somebody from Scotland is going to
call, it was just a lot of publicity,'' she said.
   Still, the mother-to-be said she didn't do too much talking on
the radio.
   ``I didn't say much,'' Mrs. Machamer. ``It was a little
embarrassing.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules Dissident Polygamists Can See Sect Leaders' Accounts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dissidents who have sued to regain
property held in trust by leaders of their polygamist community on
the Utah-Arizona line are entitled to a financial accounting, a
federal judge ruled Monday.
   An attorney for the dissidents characterized the order by U.S.
District Judge Bruce Jenkis as a significant victory for his
clients, but a defense attorney said it would make little
difference in the three-year-old case.
   The order is the latest in the legal battle between the leaders
of the adjacent towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Ariz.,
and about 35 residents who claim they were wrongly evicted from
their homes for dissenting from some religious tenets of their
breakaway Mormon sect.
   The plaintiffs, many of whom still live in the twin communities
of about 3,000, are seeking to dissolve the trust, contending the
leaders have misappropriated funds and commingled religious and
municipal money.
   Followers pledged their land, homes and a percentage of their
incomes to the trust. The trust owns most of the property in both
communities. The dissidents say they were promised the property
eventually would become theirs in exchange for development or
contributions to the community.
   The communities were founded in the 1920s by a group bent on
practicing polygamy.
   While the Mormon Church abandoned polygamy in 1890 in exchange
for Utah statehood, thousands of fundamentalists continue the
practice in remote enclaves in Utah, Idaho, Montana, Arizona and
Mexico. They believe it remains a commandment essential for a
person's eternal welfare. Polygamists once were hunted down but
Utah authorities now ignore the practice.
   The sect's longtime prophet, LeRoy Johnson, died three years ago
at age 98, plunging the communities into a power struggle and
federal court. He left at least 15 widows.
   Rulon Jeffs, who lives in Salt Lake County, eventually emerged
as the sect's prophet and visits the communities and other small
polygamist colonies scattered in the two states.
   Jenkins ruled the plaintiffs can require an accounting of the
trust despite defense arguments that the proper venue is state, not
federal, court.
   Jenkins said that although Utah law holds that state courts
exercise ``exclusive jurisdiction'' over matters of trust law,
``this court adopts the general principle that federal courts
should usually reject state legislative attempts to limit the reach
of federal jurisdiction.''
   Jenkins also denied the leaders' motion to quash subpoenas for
their bank account records and their request for a protective order
that would keep the plaintiffs from examining the material.
   Jenkins denied the plaintiffs' motion for a partial summary
judgment making the transfer of their property to the trust null
and void, saying the legal status of the trust - whether it is
private or charitable - has not been determined.
   Salt Lake attorney Jeff Swinton, who represents the plaintiffs,
said Jenkins' orders ``are very significant rulings to give us the
rights we've been trying to get for three years in the courts and
for many years before.''
   He said the ruling would enable the discovery process to
continue, but that it might force a delay in a scheduled Dec. 20
pretrial hearing if all the information cannot be obtained by that
time.
   Defense attorney Scott Berry said that while his clients would
comply with the order, ``We don't believe the plaintiffs' access to
those accounts will make any substantial difference.
   ``There's no smoking gun ... it's more of a big nuisance than a
setback,'' Berry said.
   Of some 35 motions in the plaintiffs' original complaint, about
20 remain to be resolved either by the judge or at trial, Swinton
said.

   Iraq said Monday it will send 250,000 more troops into Kuwait.
Mikhail S. Gorbachev refrained from supporting a U.N. resolution
allowing use of force to resolve the gulf crisis, but agreed with
President Bush in Paris that the military option cannot be ruled
out.
   The additional soldiers Saddam Hussein is sending will more than
double his country's military strength in the conquered emirate and
give Iraq a superiority ``others cannot match,'' according to the
Iraqi News Agency.
   INA announced the buildup 11 days after Bush said America would
send 200,000 more soldiers to the Persian Gulf, bringing the U.S.
force to about 430,000.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the new Iraqi
deployment ``another instance of him (Saddam) thumbing his nose at
the United Nations.''
   He said in Paris the development ``emphasizes that we must keep
the pressure on with regards to U.N. sanctions. It also underscores
the cynicism with which Saddam Hussein treats the hostages.''
   The United Nations has tried in 10 U.N. resolutions to force
Iraq through an economic squeeze to quit Kuwait, which Iraqi forces
invaded on Aug. 2. Iraq kept thousands of foreigners from leaving
after the invasion and used many as ``human shields'' at potential
Iraqi targets.
   Bush was in Paris for signing of an arms reduction treaty by
NATO and Warsaw Pact members. He used the gathering to try to win
more support for a U.N. resolution authorizing an attack to drive
Iraq from Kuwait, but Soviet President Gorbachev balked at
endorsing the idea.
   Bush and Gorbachev met for a late dinner that focused in large
part on such possible use of military force.
   Fitzwater told reporters in a joint briefing with Gorbachev's
new spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, ``We are united on this issue. We
have a conceptual agreement that force cannot be ruled out.''
   He said the leaders discussed the circumstances that might
prompt a military offensive against Iraq, but ``We simply have not
reached the point of decision yet.''
   The United States continued its buildup by loading hundreds of
jeeps, trucks and armored vehicles aboard the first of 20 to 30
ships that are to sail from Rotterdam, Netherlands, a Dutch Army
spokesman said.
   The United States says its buildup should be completed by
January.
   Analysts have said a military strike by the multinational forces
is most likely in winter because of lower temperatures and
generally calm weather. Sandstorms usually occur in April.
   Most of the U.S. troops in the gulf region are in Saudi Arabia,
and Bush scrapped planned rotations for them when he announced the
U.S. buildup.
   Those first soldiers were deployed after Iraq overran Kuwait,
and they are the foundation of a multinational force of about
350,000 troops.
   Iraq is believed to now have about 170,000 troops in Kuwait and
about 250,000 men in southern Iraq.
   INA said Saddam met with his military commanders on Monday and
decided to send 250,000 more soldiers.
   ``It is worth mentioning that according to military
considerations, the percentage of attacking force to defending
force is 3 to 1,'' the news agency said. ``This means the United
States will need to mobilize a 3 million-strong force with similar
equipment and armament to our forces'' if it is to attack.
   ``The superiority will thus remain at its required standard,
which the others cannot match.''
   There was no indication of where the extra regular troops would
come from. Iraq's army totals 555,000 regular troops and 480,000
reserves.
   Western military analysts say Iraq's reserves are poor in
quality.
   But its regular army includes about 120,000 elite Republican
Guards, who led Iraq's offensives in the closing stages of Iraq's
1980-88 war with Iran. They also led the invasion of Kuwait.
   Iraq announced its troop buildup a day after it said it would
free the estimated 2,000 remaining Westerners hostages in Iraq and
Kuwait between Christmas and March ``unless something would take
place that mars the atmosphere of peace.''
   Saddam has been releasing Westerners a few at a time, including
136 Sunday. That group included 75 Americans, 67 of whom flew home
from London, arriving Monday night at Dulles International Airport
outside Washington.
   Bush called the Iraqi announcement abid to buy time. ``This
cynicism of starting to release them on Christmas Day will be seen
by the world as a total ploy,'' he said.
   French presidency spokesman Hubert Vedrine said Monday in Paris
that Baghdad's latest initiative ``will not modify France's
position'' - that U.N. resolutions regarding Iraq must be strictly
applied, including ``unconditional release of all Western hostages
and complete withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait.''
   Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warned that fighting
might erupt unless Iraq withdraws.
   But some U.S. allies, including the Soviet Union and Germany,
have expressed concern that Bush is rushing toward war. They say
the U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq should be given more time
to work before force is used.
   In other developments Monday:
   -High winds and rough seas forced Marines to cancel a second
attempt to storm a Saudi beach in an amphibious landing exercise.
Officials said no further attempts will be made.
   -Diplomats waited to see whether Iraq would follow through on a
promise to release about 50 more hostages. Edgar Oehler, a Swiss
parliamentarian, said they included Swiss nationals, 25 of various
nationalities working for Swiss companies and others.
   -Bush has indefinitely postponed a meeting with King Hussein of
Jordan, the royal palace in Amman said. The meeting was to have
been held in Paris. A government source claimed Bush put off the
meeting after Hussein criticized the U.S. administration for its
stance on the gulf crisis.
   -German Chancellor Helmut Kohl demanded in a late-night news
briefing in Paris, that Iraq release all hostages before Christmas,
saying holding captives does not ``lessen the dangers of war.''
   -Kuwait's government in exile indicated approval Tuesday of use
of nuclear arms against Iraqi forces in Kuwait. Sheikh Naser
al-Sabah, minister of state for foreign affairs, was asked in an
interview by a Canberra, Australia, radio station: ``So you
wouldn't be unhappy if nuclear arms were used?'' Al-Sabah replied:
``For the application of the international law, not at all.''

   Boris N. Yeltsin, the chief rival of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, demanded Monday that the Soviet president consult with
the 15 republics before putting into effect Gorbachev's plan to
reorganize the national government.
   National lawmakers on Monday told Gorbachev to return to
parliament in a month to deliver a progress report on his plans to
solve the country's mounting economic and ethnic crises.
   Yeltsin, president of the Russian federation, the largest
republic, berated Gorbachev for proposing the restructuring without
consulting the republics, and said such a decision-making process
is unacceptable to Russia.
   Yeltsin said the Soviet people should be allowed to vote on
their central government's performance.
   The developments added to the pressure on Gorbachev, who faces
growing anger over his domestic policies.
   Lawmakers from the left and right are demanding stronger
measures for regulating chronic shortages of food, settling issues
of the republic' drives for more freedom from the Kremlin, and
ending a power struggle with Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin and even Gorbachev have referred to the government
crisis as a ``paralysis of power.'' Laws implemented by the central
government are being ignored or overridden by many republics,
including Russia, which are seeking greater control over political
and economic affairs.
   Gorbachev went before lawmakers Saturday and won preliminary
approval for a government reorganization that would eliminate the
post of prime minister, held by his embattled supporter Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov, and put the entire executive branch under presidential
control.
   The reorganization also would create a powerful new council of
republic leaders.
   However, lawmakers showed Monday they would not settle for just
passing Gorbachev's proposals. They approved a preliminary agenda
for the Dec. 17 session of their parent parliamentary body, the
Congress of People's Deputies, that says Gorbachev must deliver a
progress report on his plans, according to news reports.
   The parliament itself must approve the agenda when it convenes.
   ``It was stated by the deputies that the president's report ...
should not include the analysis of the situation in the country,
but it should rather include an account of the practical measures
undertaken by the president,'' according to the government
newspaper Izvestia.
   The agenda also called for discussion of Gorbachev's proposed
union treaty to unite the Soviet republic in a new federation, his
proposals for reorganizing the government and unspecified
amendments to the Soviet constitution, the official Tass news
agency said.
   It said the agenda also included legislation to create rules for
holding national referendums, discussion of rules on elections to
fill vacant legislative seats and one on ejecting lawmakers from
the Supreme Soviet legislature, and confirmation of the new Soviet
prosecutor general.
   The 542 members of the Supreme Soviet are chosen from among the
2,250-member congress, which has final parliamentary authority and
has met only four times since its founding in 1988.
   The vote Monday came as Yeltsin, in his first public reaction to
Gorbachev's proposals, demanded Gorbachev consult with leaders of
the 15 republics before implementing his reorganization plan. He
also complained that Gorbachev never talked with them before
proposing the plan.
   ``That means that again, knowing that the republics won't
approve of it, (Kremlin leaders) want to push it forward. But their
reaction will be opposite,'' Yeltsin said.
   ``I am even convinced that all this will only make the situation
in the country worse, rather than improve it,'' he said.
   Yeltsin also told the independent news agency Interfax he found
some of Gorbachev's ideas ``disappointing,'' but did not specify
which ones. He said he needed to study the proposals thoroughly.
   ``The president's suggestions are all aimed at strengthening the
center,'' he told Interfax.
   Yeltsin, in an address Monday to the Ukrainian legislature in
Kiev, also compared Gorbachev with former Soviet leader Nikita
Krushchev, who started a limited reform drive when he came to power
in 1953. It was a time ``when the center was trying to centralize
everything, and reforms came to an end,'' Yeltsin said.
   He also said ``Russia is ready for the implementation'' of a
referendum on the ``entire presidency'' system and on the
government's performance, according to Interfax. He apparently was
referring to the legislation that would set up a procedure for
holding referendums, but Interfax gave no other details.
   Yeltsin was in Kiev to sign a trade agreement with the Ukraine,
as several other republics have.
   Gorbachev had urged the Council of Ministers be replaced by
several bodies under direct presidential control. The principal
ruling body would be the Federation Council, created in March as a
presidential advisory body but which would now be made the highest
body of state power and include representatives of the Soviet
republics.
   Gorbachev adviser Giorgi Shakhnazarov, speaking in Paris where
Gorbachev was attending a 34-nation summit, said the post of prime
minister would be preserved, in apparent contradiction to
Gorbachev's remarks. He said Ryzhkov likely would not get the job
but did know who would.
   He said the new Council of Ministers would be smaller, with 12
or 15 members, and that the new structure would be ``something
between the U.S. and French systems.''
   In the United States, the president holds a four-year term with
strong executive authority. In France, the president is elected to
a seven-year term, has strong executive authority, and appoints the
prime minister.

   The band Milli Vanilli was stripped of its
Grammy Award on Monday because other singers substituted for the
pop duo on the best-selling ``Girl, You Know It's True'' album.
   It's the first time in the 34-year history of Grammys that an
award had been taken away.
   Trustees of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences
voted overwhelmingly to rescind the award given to Milli Vanilli
members Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan, said academy President
Michael Greene.
   ``The academy hopes its action sends a clear signal to
producers, music packagers and record companies that they need to
take very seriously their task of giving us and the public credible
information on that packaging,'' he said.
   ``I do think it's an isolated incident. We are as upset about it
as the public has the right to be.''
   The attorney representing Pilatus and Morvan said the pair
already had planned to surrender the Grammy.
   ``My guess is when the academy read that, they decided to beat
us to the game,'' attorney Alan Mintz said.
   ``Needless to say, this is an emotionally trying time. But
(Pilatus and Morvan) are determined to prove to the world that they
will come back strongly and demonstrate that they are indeed
artists.''
   In a related development, an Oakland woman who bought her son a
Milli Vanilli tape filed a class action lawsuit Monday seeking a
refund in light of the revelation that the duo didn't sing a note
on the recording.
   ``I want everyone to be able to get money back. I don't want the
producer in Germany to profit from what he did to these kids,''
Sheila Stalder said at a news conference in her lawyer's San
Francisco office.
   If the lawsuit filed in Alameda County Superior Court is won,
anyone in California who bought Milli Vanilli recordings or
attended the pop duo's concerts would be entitled to a refund, said
lawyer Alan Caplan.
   The lawsuit also seeks to recover profits and place them in a
trust benefiting consumer groups as outlined in the state's
consumer protection statute, Caplan said.
   Pilatus, 25, from Germany, and Morvan, also 25 and a native of
the Caribbean island of Guadaloupe, scheduled a Tuesday news
conference in Los Angeles to discuss the scandal. They were
unavailable for comment on Monday.
   A decision on the disposition of the 1989 new artist award will
be made by an academy subcommittee Dec. 5 in New York.
   Pilatus and Morvan, the dancing, dreadlocked frontmen for the
group, suggested the award go to the three singers who actually
performed the vocals for Milli Vanilli. Greene said that was ``not
a possibility.''
   In announcing its unprecedented move, the academy said it
recognizes that ``packaging'' groups is part of the music industry,
especially in the kind of ``Euro-dance'' music performed by Milli
Vanilli.
   But misleading record labels are unacceptable, Greene said.
   ``The integrity of that album label copy obviously was flawed.
It said `Vocals: Rob and Fab.' That was just absolutely false,'' he
said.
   Shortly before the academy announced its decision, Milli
Vanilli's producer, Frank Farian, and record company, Arista
Records, called on the duo to surrender the Grammy.
   ``Initially, I felt that this honor gave recognition to the
entire Milli Vanilli team. This has not, however, been the case,''
Farian said in a statement from Frankfurt.
   He said that by returning the Grammy, ``Rob and Fab can put this
episode behind them and mark the beginning of a new career for
themselves.''
   The lip-sync controversy erupted last eek when Farian disclosed
to The Associated Press that others actually sang on the record
credited to Pilatus and Morvan. The photogenic pair also lip-synced
their way through live performances, including one at the Grammy
Awards show, Farian said.
   The album was distributed by Arista Records. After Farian
confirmed the rumors, Arista's executive vice president, Roy Lott,
said: ``Seven million albums? Embarrassing, I don't mean the end
justifies the means, but we sold 7 million albums.''
   On Monday, Lott said Arista no knowledge of the deception when
it released the album.
   Pilatus and Morvan have alleged that Arista knew they weren't
really the singers. Vocalists Johnny Davis, Charles Shaw and Brad
Howell reportedly sang on the Milli Vanilli record.

<HEAD>Court Says Vichy Official Can be Tried for War Crimes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court ruled Monday that a Frenchman accused of
sending 194 Jewish children to their deaths in Nazi camps can be
tried for war crimes.
   Rene Bousquet, 81, who is accused of crimes against humanity,
was national police chief under the collaborating Vichy government
in World War II.
   Appeals Court Judge Albert Moatty decided Monday that Bousquet
can be tried by an ordinary court.
   State prosecutors in September asked that Bousquet be
investigated in connection with the childrens' deportation.
   A lower court held in Paris last month that Bousquet could be
tried only by the High Court of the Liberation, formed in 1944 to
prosecute officials of the government under Nazi occupation. That
court has been defunct for decades.
   Moatty's ruling allowed state prosecutors to resume their
investigation of evidence uncovered by Nazi-hunters.
   The International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism hailed
the decision. ``France is a great country, capable of looking into
the dark times of its past,'' the group said in a statement.
   The lower court's ruling had infuriated human rights activists,
who feared Bousquet would escape prosecution.
   Rights leaders say no high-ranking French officials directly
involved in deporting and arresting 100,000 Jews during the war
have been brought to trial.
   Serge Klarsfeld, a lawyer and prominent Nazi-hunter, has said
senior government officials, including President Francois
Mitterrand, appear reluctant to pursue the case.
   Bousquet was condemned in 1949 for alleged collaboration with
the Nazis, but was freed for ``acts accomplished in favor of the
Resistance.'' He freed some jailed Resistance fighters when he was
ousted from his post.
   A federation of human rights groups organized an inquiry
commission to determine why cases against Bousquet and two other
suspected war criminals, Paul Touvier and Maurice Papon, have taken
so long.
   Touvier, 75, is being prosecuted for his activities as a
pro-Nazi militia chief in Lyon. He was captured last year after
spending years hiding out with the help of right-wing Roman
Catholic monks.
   Charges against Papon, a former budget minister, have been
pending for seven years. He has been accused of being responsible
for the arrests and deportations of 1,700 Jews while a wartime
administrator in Bordeaux.

   Radicals were suspected of firing four homemade
mortars that smashed into the grounds of a Shinto shrine in central
Japan on Tuesday, police said. There was no major damage or
injuries.
   One of the missiles pierced the roof of a souvenir shop at the
Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya, 170 miles west of Tokyo, according to
Aichi Prefectural Police. Police found three other projectiles on
the ground.
   The shrine is dedicated to five deities, including Amaterasu
Omikani, the sun goddess who in the Shinto religion is considered
the ancestor of the imperial family.
   Anti-monarchist radicals have staged dozens such attacks this
month to protest the ceremonies surrounding last Monday's
enthronement of Emperor Akihito.
   The homemade missiles fired by the radicals usually don't
contain any explosives, and are intended primarily for symbolic
impact.
   None of the attacks have caused serious injury.
   In one of the last enthronement rituals, Akihito will perform
the Daijosai, or the Great Food Offering Ritual, on Thursday and
Friday.

   Raymond Robert Clark went silently to his
death in Florida's electric chair Monday for shooting to death a
scrap yard owner after forcing him to write a $5,000 check.
   Clark, 49, who died in the chair at 7:07 a.m. EST, did not make
a final statement. The night before, he expressed his ``real
concern'' for the family of David Drake, whom he killed on April
27, 1977, said Susan Cary, a Gainesville attorney and unpaid
advocate for death-row inmates.
   Clark was the 25th Florida inmate to be strapped into the
electric chair since the state resumed executions in 1979. In all,
142 people have been killed nationwide since the U.S. Supreme Court
reinstated capital punishment in 1976;
   Under his fifth death warrant, Clark had been scheduled to be
executed Nov. 14. But a pair of temporary court delays pushed it
back first to Saturday and then Monday morning.
   Among those witnessing the execution was Drake's 38-year-old
son, Gregory.
   ``It's wrong, taking so long,'' he said. ``I would like to see
the appeals system changed. I am definitely for a person having an
appeal. But I don't think it should continue, continue and
continue.''
   He said he wanted to witness the execution because ``the person
you can think of who you love the most was taken from you without
saying good-bye. I know my dad would've done this for me.''
   The victim's wife, Donna Drake, did not attend.
   ``My sorrow is for my husband,'' she said in St. Petersburg. ``I
won't call it revenge. It's just a feeling that I owed this to my
husband - to make sure he (Clark) didn't get back on those streets
and do it again to someone else and ruin another family like he's
ruined us.''
   Clark's appeals were exhausted Sunday when the U.S. Supreme
Court voted 8-1 to reject two emergency delay requests. Dissenting
was Justice Thurgood Marshall, who opposes the death penalty in all
circumstances.
   Clark and his young male lover abducted Drake from a St.
Petersburg bank parking lot, drove him to a secluded area north of
the city and ordered him at gunpoint to write a $5,000 check. Clark
then shot Drake twice in the head.
   When the pair couldn't cash the check, they called Drake's son
and demanded $10,000 for his father's safe return.
   Police traced the phone calls to Drake and Ty Johnston, then 16.
   Johnston was arrested in California and was allowed to plead
guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for testimony against
Clark. He received a 25-year prison sentence and was paroled in
1987 after serving nine years.
   When Drake was killed, Clark was on parole from California for
the killing of a 14-year-old boy.

<HEAD>Man Holds Shoppers Hostage After Robbing Restaurant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A gunman who said he robbed a restaurant to
get money for his sick daughter rushed into a nearby supermarket
Monday and took at least seven people hostage before releasing them
unharmed 4{ hours later.
   The standoff at the Food Lion store began about about 11:20 a.m.
after the man, identified as Gregory D. Goodman, had robbed a
nearby Ponderosa restaurant in this small town 15 miles north of
Richmond, authorities said.
   Goodman, of Prince George's County, Md., fired several shots but
no one was harmed during the ordeal, said Seward McGhee, assistant
commonwealth's attorney for Hanover County.
   McGhee said hostages later told authorities Goodman said he
robbed the restaurant to get money for an operation for his
daughter. McGhee said he had no more information about Goodman's
daughter or her ailment because officials had not interviewed him.
   Penny Seymour, 27, who was grocery shopping when Goodman
entered, was among about 10 people who escaped before the standoff
began.
   ``We heard a noise,'' she said. ``I honestly thought a can had
fallen off a shelf. That was the first gunshot. Then we heard the
noise about three times in a row.''
   Ms. Seymour, a friend and the two children they had brought on
their shopping trip fled through a rear door.
   It was not known exactly how many hostages had been held.
   After the standoff began, Goodman released at least three
people, including a baby. When he surrendered over the telephone at
about 3:50 p.m., authorities found four hostages inside.
   Goodman dropped his gun, lay on the floor and told a state
trooper entering the store: ``I give myself up. I didn't hurt
anybody.''

<HEAD>Study Shows Suppressed Anger May Be Fatal For Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who hold in their anger may think they are
acting polite, but they are also risking their lives, a University
of Michigan researcher said Monday.
   Mara Julius, a researcher at the university's School of Public
Health, presented her findings over the weekend at a meeting of the
Gerontological Society of America.
   Her survey of 372 women and 324 men revealed that women who
habitually stifle high levels of anger had a death rate during an
18-year study period three times higher than women who release
their anger. However, this did not hold true for men.
   Those surveyed ranged in age from 30 to 69 in 1971 when they
were interviewed to study their behavior characteristics and
whether they tended to hold in their anger or let it out. Follow-up
mortality studies were done in 1983 and 1989.
   Anger suppression seems to affect the mortality rates of only
those men who have high blood pressure or chronic bronchial
conditions, Julius said.
   ``Suppressed anger is a significant ... predictor of mortality
risk among women,'' the study said.
   Julius said she could only speculate on the different results
between men and women.
   ``We are definitely trained differently,'' she said. ``There are
different norms of expectation of how to behave.''
   While women are expected to show some emotions, anger tends not
to be one of them, she said. Similarly, anger tends to be more
accepted among men, Julius said.
   Julius said she did not know if it could be proven that
suppressed anger directly causes death, but ``it's an independent
risk.''
   The results ``clearly supported the inference that gender is
implicated in the relationship between mortality risk and
anger-suppression,'' the study said.

<HEAD>School Evacuated After Carbon Monoxide Leak Sickens More Than 100</HEAD>

<DATELINE>POTWIN, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A carbon monoxide leak from a faulty furnace
Monday sickened most of the 150 pupils at an elementary school in
south-central Kansas, authorities said.
   School buses, ambulances and private vehicles took 142 children
to local hospitals, but all were later released, said Butler County
Sheriff Dave Williams.
   The children complained of headaches and nausea. Some of them
lost consciousness but were revived outside the school, said Ron
Morrison, a Butler County undersheriff.
   ``They were basically dropping like flies,'' said teacher Cathy
Cuckler. ``We didn't understand what was going on.''
   A subsequent investigation showed a rusted 12-inch flue pipe
allowed fumes from a natural gas forced-air furnace to leak into
the school's basement, said Whitewater Deputy Fire Chief Chuck
Eberhard. The furnace fan then spread the the tainted air
throughout the school.
   Student Kim Purcell said she was in a restroom when she was
told: ``Get your coat. Something smells real yucky.''
   Three or four of the school's 15 staff members also were checked
at hospitals, said Mike Philpot, Remington School District
superintendent.
   Philpot said the furnace system had been properly inspected and
had been used this school year.
   KPL Gas Service Co. officials found high carbon monoxide
concentrations inside the school.
   Blood tests on the children found carbon monoxide concentrations
ranging from 9 percent to 12 percent, which are considered
relatively low levels, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   A National Guard reservist who filed a
lawsuit in an effort to block his deployment to the Middle East
began his journey to Saudi Arabia on Monday.
   Sgt. Michael R. Ange, 26, flew from the Norfolk Naval Base to
Dover, Del., before heading to Saudi Arabia, said Staff Sgt.
Rebecca Marcum at Fort Lee. She did not say when Ange was expected
to arrive in the Middle East.
   Ange's unit, the 1450th Transportation Company of Jefferson,
N.C., left Thursday night to join a U.S.-led multinational force
deployed to Saudi Arabia since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Ange
stayed behind for Army medical tests.
   Ange filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington last
week, arguing that he could not be sent to Saudi Arabia because
President Bush did not have congressional approval for the military
buildup there.
   A federal judge refused to issue a temporary restraining order
to block Ange's deployment, but scheduled a Dec. 10 hearing to hear
a request for a permanent injunction.
   Ange also has argued that is medically unfit for duty, saying he
has stomach ulcers and foot and leg problems that prevent him from
running and wearing combat boots.
   Army officials ruled Saturday night that Ange did not have a
medical condition that would impair his ability to serve.
   Although Ange said he believed he received an appropriate
medical review, he said ``there is a conflict of interests'' in
having the Army finding him fit to serve.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects CNN Bid To Broadcast Noriega Tapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has refused to give Cable
News Network permission to broadcast tape recordings of
conversations between Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega and his lawyers.
   CNN, meanwhile, is demanding the FBI return a box of recordings
and papers related to the case. The material was taken from an
Atlanta hotel room where a CNN reporter stayed.
   The Supreme Court on Nov. 18 rejected an emergency request by
CNN that was aimed at lifting a federal judge's order forbidding
the broadcasts until he could determine what the tapes disclose.
The vote was 7-2.
   The emergency request had called the Nov. 8 order by U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami an unconstitutional
``prior restraint'' of free speech. But only two justices -
Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor - agreed with that
assessment.
   Voting against CNN were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.
   The Justice Department had joined Noriega's lawyers in opposing
the request.
   CNN President Tom Johnson called the court's decision ``a loss
of a battle in a continuing war against censorship.''
   Johnson said the network would immediately turn the tapes in its
possession over to Judge Hoeveler. He said CNN is ``confident that
after he reviews them he will decide on the merits to deny the
prior restraint.''
   Meanwhile, many questions remained about the network material in
the FBI's possession.
   CNN said the tapes and documents were taken by security officers
from an Omni Hotel room that had been used by reporter Marlene
Fernandez, who had been covering the Noriega story.
   Johnson said Fernandez had not checked out of the room, but the
hotel staff, apparently mistakenly, cleared out her room.
   After taking the box from the room, the hotel's security guards
saw that some of its contents were CNN property, he said. They
turned the material over to Turner security officers, from whom the
FBI took the box.
   Johnson said it was still unclear how the FBI was notified about
the box.
   Turner Security, which provides security for the CNN Center
complex, which contains both the hotel and the CNN offices, ``had a
discussion with the FBI inquiring about stolen government property,
and Turner Security told them they had a box that might fit that
description,'' CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said. CNN denied the
material in the box was stolen.
   Haworth said Turner Security - a subsidiary of CNN's parent
company, Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. - did not tell
appropriate CNN officials it had the box.
   The New York Times quoted an unidentified CNN official as saying
the actual Noriega recordings were not in the box.
   ``The FBI did not get the main course,'' the official said.

<HEAD>Union Employees of UPI Accept Pay Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union employees of United Press International
on Nov. 16 accepted a proposed 35-percent pay cut for 90 days.
   Chris Dahl, secretary-treasurer of the Wire Service Guild, said
the pay cut was approved by 62 percent of those voting. The numbers
voting on each side were not released.
   Dahl spoke by telephone from the union's headquarters in New
York, where the ballots were counted.
   UPI vice president and spokesman Milt Capps said before the vote
that if employees accepted the pay cut, the company would be in a
financial condition to continue operating for 60 to 90 days while
it seeks a buyer.
   The financially troubled, 83-year-old news service already has
cut management salaries by the same percentage for 90 days.
   Capps had said if the pay cut were rejected, UPI might file for
protection under federal bankruptcy laws within days.
   Union officers had recommended rejection, saying the employees
could not afford the pay cut and it would not be enough to keep the
company afloat.
   Dahl said about 310 UPI employees are members of the guild. He
said the total work force covered by the union contract, counting
those who are not members, is close to 400.
   Capps said the company does not give out information on how many
bureaus or how many employees it has at home and abroad. UPI
announced in September that it was closing bureaus in New Mexico,
Wyoming, Montana, Michigan and North Dakota. It has since laid off
an unspecified number of employees.
   The top scale for a newsperson at UPI is approximately $690 a
week.
   The news service, founded in 1907 as United Press, became United
Press International when it merged with Hearst's International News
Service in 1958.
   In recent years, the company encountered financial difficulties
and changed hands three times.
   The original owner, the E.W. Scripps Co., sold it in 1982 to
Media News Corp. of Nashville, Tenn. It continued to lose money and
was sold in 1985 to Mario Vasquez-Rana, a wealthy Mexican newspaper
publisher.
   The present owner is Infotechnology Inc., parent firm to a
number of high-tech ventures.
   Infotechnology announced this month it has retained an
investment banking firm to negotiate the sale of its companies, and
hopes to sell them by the end of the year.

<HEAD>Daily News Struggles To Lift Circulation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Circulation remained a serious problem for the
Daily News as it continued to publish in the third week of a
strike. A spot check of news vendors around the city showed that
many who have stopped selling the paper have no plans to take it
back until the strike is over.
   The manager of a newsstand at 50th Street and Seventh Avenue in
Manhattan said he was visited by ``some union guys, goons, who said
they would put a chain around the whole stand and pull it off its
foundation.'' Others threatened to pour gasoline on the stand and
burn it.
   Daily News circulation representatives visited him Nov. 14. The
manager, who would give his name only as ``Danny,'' said they
offered him round-the-clock protection and a $25 daily discount on
his pre-strike purchase of 350 papers a day, normally about $99. He
declined.
   The Daily News, using management, replacement workers and about
150 Newspaper Guild members who are working, has published every
day since the strike began Oct. 25.
   But circulation has been a major problem. The News said earlier
that it was printing 600,000 papers a day and selling about
400,000, down from 1.09 million before the strike. It said 2,000 of
its usual 12,000 outlets were selling the paper.
   At least 39 vendors have reported being threatened or harassed.
Police said they had recorded 168 incidents and 81 arrests since
the strike began.
   The News has hired hawkers, including homeless and other
unemployed people in an attempt to fill the void.
   The Police Department said it has spent $4.2 million on straight
pay and overtime for hundreds of officers and supervisors assigned
to the strike - an average of $233,899 a day.
   Meanwhile, a striking Daily News truck driver was arrested Nov.
16 and accused of setting explosions at an all-night convenience
store on Long Island.
   Charles Esposito, 47, was arrested in a car seen leaving a
Seven-11 store in Westbury around the time two small bombs
exploded, causing minor injuries to the manager and a customer.
   The day before, the municipal workers union offered to provide
bus fare home for out-of-town replacement workers who leave.
   The New York Times reported that a security firm hired by the
Daily News used unemployed veterans and other jobless men from the
South to drive delivery trucks and collect money from vendors. Some
of the men were reportedly unable to return to their homes as they
wished, because they had no transportation.
   Two men told the Times that Daily News management wanted to
videotape them and other guards being beaten by strikers, then use
the evidence against the unions in court.
   News publisher James Hoge, in a letter to Times Executive Editor
Max Frankel, said the story was distorted. He said one of the men
never worked for the security company and the other worked for one
day.
   In another development, Marcia Kramer, City Hall bureau chief
for the News since 1986, joined WCBS-TV as a full-time reporter.

<HEAD>Bay Area Papers Reach Agreement With Unions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marathon negotiations produced a tentative
agreement Nov. 17 that averted a strike at the Bay Area's three
largest newspapers.
   The 45-month pact calls for a 3.5 percent to 4 percent annual
wage increase for the unions representing some 4,500 employees at
the San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco Chronicle and the San
Jose Mercury News.
   Union leaders indicated the votes on the proposed contract would
be taken sometime after Thanksgiving.
   Employees had been without a contract since February. A strike
deadline of 5 p.m., Nov. 16, had been set, but talks continued
through the night. After 48 continuous hours of negotiations, union
officials announced the tentative pact.
   The settlement would provide $89 per week more over the course
of the contract, which expires in November 1993, for craft unions
such as printers and engravers, and $95 for reporters, editors and
drivers.
   Current top scale is $801 a week for reporters and editors, $669
for clerical and library workers and $675 for drivers. The unions
had sought a 20 percent wage hike.
   The three papers have a combined circulation of about 1 million.
   Doug Cuthbertson, chairman of the Conference of Newspaper
Unions, said, ``At this time of terrible economic difficulties for
news and other businesses across the country, I think the employers
have given us every last cent they could afford to.''

<HEAD>Wall Street Journal Shutting Philadelphia Bureau</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Wall Street Journal says it is closing its
Philadelphia bureau at the end of the year to save money and will
transfer or lay off the office's 10 news workers.
   The number of layoffs wasn't announced, though a union official
said six reporters would lose their jobs.
   Dow Jones &amp; Co., which publishes the Journal, believes it can
maintain the quality of its news coverage by transferring stories
handled by the Philadelphia office to the New York staff, spokesman
Roger May said Nov. 13.
   Ronald Chen, president of the 1,800-member Independent
Association of Publishers' Employees, disagreed. Quality will
suffer ``unless they're going to tell you people who are working 10
or 11 hours a day can heap two hours on top of that,'' he said.
   Dow Jones recently announced a 17.5 percent drop in
third-quarter profit, reflecting declining advertising and the
acquisition of the financial information service, Telerate Inc.
   Dow Jones has no plans to close any of its remaining 13 domestic
news bureaus, May said.
   In another cost-cutting move, May said Dow Jones plans to
relocate certain overseas editors to consolidate all copy editing
in New York. Some of the overseas workers will probably lose their
jobs, he said.
   The company also will close its newspaper composing operation in
Naperville, Ill., leaving the paper with three other sites for
newspaper makeup around the nation.
   Chen said that closing and other recent layoffs had cost 46
employees their jobs.
   May said he was unable to give precise figures for layoffs or
the potential savings.

<HEAD>Interest in Economic News Jumps Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis was the news story
most closely followed by the American public last month, although
interest in economic conditions jumped markedly, according to a
poll released Nov. 14.
   Nearly two-thirds of a nationwide sample of adults questioned in
a Times-Mirror poll said they were very closely following the Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait and the presence of U.S. military forces in
Saudi Arabia. It was the fourth consecutive month the gulf
situation has been the top story.
   Interest in the plight of U.S. hostages in Iraq and Kuwait was
also high, with 49 percent saying they were following the story
closely.
   Interest in the economy rose to its highest point for the year,
39 percent. That was 10 points higher than in September and only
one point below the level of public interest the Times-Mirror poll
found in the October 1987 stock market crash.
   And 38 percent of those polled said they followed news about
elections and campaigns in their states - about on a par with this
year's turnout level, estimated at 36 percent. A month earlier,
only 18 percent reported paying close attention to election news.
   The budget negotiations on Capitol Hill intensified and
concluded in October, but the level of public interest stayed the
same as October - 34 percent. Only 46 percent of those questioned
knew that Congress had adjourned after reaching an agreement, the
poll found. Thirty percent thought it had adjourned without one and
24 percent had no idea.
   The Times-Mirror Center for The People and The Press questioned
1,208 people nationwide from Nov. 8-11. The margin of error for the
poll was plus or minus 3 percent.

<HEAD>Price Relinquishes Day-to-Day Control at The National</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president and publisher of The National has
been relieved of day-to-day duties at the sports daily and three
other top executives have been dismissed, a company spokesman
confirmed Nov. 12.
   An executive associated with the Mexican media and entertainment
concern that is the paper's biggest shareholder has been brought in
to take greater control of operations at the 9-month-old newspaper.
   The newspaper has also laid off 18 news employees. Spokesman
Steve Hammond said they were mostly support workers like layout
designers and copy editors at sites across the country..
   The moves come as the paper continues to absorb heavy losses in
its bid to succeed as the United States' first national sports
daily.
   Backers of the newspaper have run into a miserable advertising
climate and skepticism about the potential audience for a daily
publication devoted exclusively to sports.
   Peter O. Price will continue to hold the titles of president and
publisher but will be involved with broad, non-operational issues,
Hammond said.
   He said Price would be involved, for instance, in planning for
the rollout into new markets. The National is available in nine
markets with plans to expand into three more -
Baltimore-Washington, Philadelphia and Atlanta - by early 1991.
   Hammond said the three executives dismissed were Diane
Morgenthaler, circulation director; Timothy Lasker, assistant
publisher, and Daniel W. Correa, finance and administration
director.
   He said none of the three has yet been replaced. He described
the changes as a ``business decision,'' but declined to elaborate.
   Hammond said Jaime Davila has been brought in to assume Price's
operating responsibilities at the newspaper, whose biggest
shareholder is Emilio Azcarraga, the Mexican media baron.
   Davila is a top executive at Univisa Inc., the U.S. subsidiary
of Mexico's Televisa entertainment and publishing concern that
Azcarraga heads.
   It was disclosed earlier that The National will cease publishing
a Sunday edition after Nov. 25 and publish only on weekdays. The
paper had been publishing six days a week, Sunday through Friday,
since its launch Jan. 31.
   Editor in Chief Frank Deford also said earlier that there will
be a handful of jobs cuts at the paper, which employs about 200
people, but that he hoped the cuts could be made through attrition
rather than layoffs.
   The National was launched in three cities - New York, CHicago
and Los Angeles - and has since begun publishing editions in San
Diego, San Francisco, Detroit, Dallas, Boston and Miami.

<HEAD>Dow Jones Boosts Ad Rates by 7 Percent at Barron's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Nov. 16 it would boost
advertising rates by 7 percent for Barron's National Business and
Financial Weekly, effective in January.
   It was the latest in a recent series of announced increases at
publications, including Time, Newsweek and U.S. News &amp; World Report
magazines, despite a recent slump in demand for print and broadcast
advertising.
   The increase came two weeks after the weekly announced it would
boost its cover price by 50 cents to $2.50 effective Dec. 3 and
annual subscription prices by $10 a year - to $109 in 1991.
   Barron's last advertising rate increase was 5.5 percent a year
ago. This year's 7 percent increase applies to national and
regional editions.
   The national rate for a full-page ad will rise to $15,488.
   Barron's publisher Robert Paradise said the increase was fair
and reasonable given the publication's efficiency in reaching top
corporate executives, financial professionals and individual
investors.

<HEAD>Audit Bureau Gives Newspaper an Exemption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer said Nov. 12 it
had been given permission to count about 33,000 subscribers that an
industry panel had previously cut from its circulation figures.
   The newspaper said the Audit Bureau of Circulations' board had
exempted it from an interpretation of rules that had disallowed
38,957 subscribers from its circulation figures.
   The Chicago-based bureau, citing its policy of confidentiality,
declined to comment.
   The ruling means the Inquirer will report average daily
circulation of 519,894 for the six months ending Sept. 30, a gain
of 14,991 over the same period last year.
   The previous ruling would have cut the official Inquirer
circulation to 485,973, and dropped it from 12th to 16th place
among U.S. newspapers.
   At issue was a marketing effort that delivered newspapers to
suburban readers two or three days a week. Only 87 percent of these
newspapers were delivered, however, prompting the bureau to
eliminate all 38,957 from the Inquirer's circulation.
   The Inquirer protested, noting that the marketing program had
been in effect since 1985 in New Jersey and more than a year in
Pennsylvania suburbs, and had been implemented in consultation with
the bureau.
   The newspaper did not dispute the 87 percent figure, blaming
missed deliveries on independent distributors.
   The Inquirer appealed to the bureau's board, asking that 87
percent of the 38,957 be counted. The board upheld its position
that 100 percent delivery is required for special programs, but
exempted the Inquirer and agreed to count 87 percent, or 33,392,
Fancher said.
   ``Our circulation gains are real and were undisputed by the ABC
staff, and we believe the board's decision serves the best
interests of all concerned,'' Inquirer Publisher Robert J. Hall
said in a statement.

   Alaska Rural Newspapers plans to start
a weekly newspaper in Fairbanks beginning Dec. 10, company
President John Lindauer said.
   The Fairbanks Tribune will join two other newspapers in the
city, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner and the All-Alaska Weekly.
   ``I think it's a good market,'' Lindauer said. ``I think with
the development of (the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge) and the
gas pipeline, the economy is going to boom.''
   Lindauer, 51, was the Alaskan Independence Party's candidate for
governor this year until he resigned after the primary and allowed
Wally Hickel to head the ticket instead. Hickel, who favors opening
the continental shelf of the ANWR to oil and gas development, went
on to win the election.
   Lindauer said the newspaper will be an advocate for projects he
thinks will be good for the community.
   ``You can count on the Fairbanks Tribune to be an advocate for
expansion of the Alaska Railroad, opening of ANWR and construction
of the gas line,'' he said.
   The Tribune, a tabloid, will be priced at 50 cents an issue,
with 20 to 28 pages initially. The size of the staff wasn't
immediately determined.
   Alaska Rural Newspapers publishes the Alaska Commercial
Fisherman magazine and seven other weekly newspapers, in Barrow,
Valdez, Bethel, Dutch Harbor, Dillingham, King Cove-Sand Point and

   Yale President Benno C. Schmidt Jr. has
reversed his decision to halt publication of The Yale Review after
a campaign by more than 50 writers to save the 79-year-old literary
quarterly.
   Schmidt announced his change of heart in a letter to some of the

   ``I have reconsidered my conclusion about The Yale Review and
intend to try to give it a bright future,'' Schmidt said in the

   Schmidt said he would outline his plans for the Review later in
November.
   In June, he announced the Review would be shelved, citing
deficits that the university could no longer absorb and limited
readership. He noted the Review doesn't have any direct ties to
Yale academic programs.
   More than 50 novelists, poets, professors and critics, including
Iris Murdoch, Joyce Carol Oates, Adrienne Rich, George Plimpton,
Richard Wilbur and Susan Sontag, signed an appeal asking Schmidt to

<HEAD>CBS Expects To Post Loss for Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. said Nov. 19 it expects to report a
loss for the fourth quarter and decreased earnings from continuing
operations for all of 1991 compared with this year.
   The media giant said its anticipated loss for the fourth quarter
stemmed from unexpectedly large losses at the CBS Television
Network from broadcasts of major league baseball and a slowdown in
advertising.
   The last quarterly loss excluding onetime events at CBS was in
the fourth quarter of 1986, when the company lost $20 million on
continuing operations.
   CBS earned $59.5 million, or $2.31 a share, in the fourth
quarter of 1989.
   It said earnings from continuing operations are expected to be
lower in 1991 than in 1990 because of the worsening climate for
advertising and rising costs for entertainment programs and sports
rights.
   The disclosures came as CBS senior exectives planned to meet
with the CBS affiliates board.
   Earlier, the network said its decision to dismiss three
producers from its ``60 Minutes'' program was a result of a staff
restructuring and was not related to belt-tightening in the news
division.
   The move was ordered after Harry Reasoner, one of the show's
first correspondents, announced he would reduce his workload, said
spokesman Roy Brunett.
   ABC News, meanwhile, said Nov. 16 it will close its Frankfurt,
Germany, bureau and three Central American offices. ABC said last
month it would close its Chicago, Boston and Dallas bureaus.
   The latest moves were part of an overseas reorganization, said a
network executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   ABC declined to comment on the Frankfurt closing. The network
also said it would expand its Moscow and Berlin bureaus as part of
a reorganization of its overseas operations.
   About nine people will be let go because of the reorganization,
an ABC source said.
   ABC News said it also would close its offices in Panama, El
Salvador and Honduras, but keep its Nicaragua office open.

   CBS, citing difficult economic times, said Nov.
16 it's scaling back its usually lavish affiliates' convention next
June, and moving the convention from Los Angeles to New York.
   Network conventions in past years have been three-day affairs, a
mix of business, parties where guests include TV stars, and
recreational events for station executives and their spouses.
   NBC said it is reviewing its convention plans, but has made no
decision yet. ABC said its convention will be scaled back somewhat.
   Next June's CBS convention will last only a day and a half and
concentrate on business, and no spouses are invited, said CBS
spokesman George Schweitzer.
   ``We've substantially scaled it back and changed the venue,'' he
said. The usual convention business, including the screening of new
series, still will go on, he said, but ``minus the
embellishments.''
   ``It will be more of a business meeting than a three-day
adventure.''
   ABC still will hold its three-day convention in Los Angeles, and
spouses of the executives still will be invited, said ABC
spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyr. But there'll be ``more stress on
business'' this time, she said.

   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev joined European leaders today in signing a historic
treaty that cuts conventional forces in Europe and pushes the Cold
War deeper into history.
   ``It is the farthest-reaching arms agreement in history and it
signals the new world order that is emerging,'' Bush said in a
glittering signing ceremony.
   The long-sought agreement to destroy tens of thousands of tanks,
artillery and armored combat vehicles in Europe is the most
sweeping arms accord in history. It was signed as prelude to a
34-nation summit originally called to discuss European security in
the post Cold War era, but shadowed by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``We are putting an end to the previous age,'' French President
Francois Mitterrand declared as he put his signature to the treaty
documents. One by one the other leaders followed suit, with
Gorbachev the last one to wield the pen. As the treaty was passed
back to Mitterrand, the roomful of leaders applauded theirwork.

   PARIS (AP) - President Bush demanded today that Iraq's Saddam
Hussein ``turn tail 180 degrees'' and withdraw from Kuwait. British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Saddam ``has to be removed by
force'' unless he pulls out soon.
   The two leaders, meeting over breakfast before a 34-nation
summit, underscored their hardline stand against Iraq's aggression.
   The president also dismissed Saddam's proposal to begin
releasing foreign hostages beginning on Christmas. ``This cynicism
of starting to release them on Christmas Day will be seen by the
world as a total ploy,'' Bush said.
   Opening a joint news conference with Mrs. Thatcher, Bush said,
``Not surprisingly, we see eye to eye on the gulf.''
   ---&equals;
   UNDATED (AP) - President Bush today dismissed Iraq's new promise
to release all remaining hostages by March as a cynical ploy and
won the strongest endorsement yet from an ally for a U.N.
resolution authorizing an attack on Iraqi forces.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said Saddam Hussein
can avoid war only by withdrawing quickly from Kuwait.
   ``Most people understand evil has to be stopped. Either he
withdraws, or the military option has to be used,'' she said after
breakfast with Bush in Paris, where NATO and Warsaw Pact leaders
signed an arms reduction treaty.
   But other key Western allies - GErmany and Italy - said all
options short of war must first be exhausted.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Syria, a newfound U.S. ally against Saddam
Hussein, has a chemical weapons arsenal at least as dangerous as
Iraq's, U.S. experts say.
   The two nations are believed to be the biggest producers of
chemical weapons in the Mideast, creating hundreds of tons of the
deadly gas each year. World attention has focused on Iraq's
chemical capability in the three months since its unprovoked
invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
   Washington's relations with Damascus, strained for many years
over Syria's support for international terrorism and its hardline
positions against Israel, have warmed in recent weeks since the
Syrians joined the anti-Iraq coalition.
   Syria has promised to send 15,000 troops to join the U.S.-led
multinational force arrayed against Iraq in Saudi Arabia.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court is condoning at least brief

poses grave risks to unfettered reporting of court proceedings
nationwide.
   Attorney Floyd Abrams, who is representing CNN, said, ``The
court has left an opening through which defense lawyers and
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles.''
   The high court's 7-2 rejection of CNN's emergency request ``does
seem to countenance brief prior restraints of a few days' duration
based on almost no showing of need at all,'' he said.

   TOKYO (AP) - Japanese companies have set their sights on doing
business with Vietnam, which many avoided for years in order not to
upset the United States.
   ``It's Vietnam fever,'' said Tatsuo Torigoe, an Asia division
manager of Kanematsu Corp., Japan's major trading house. ``The time
has finally come for us to make a move.''
   Analysts in Tokyo believe Japanese televisions, refrigerators
and other household goods will soon fill shops in Vietnam as they
do in other nations around the globe.
   They also expect Japanese businessmen to buy more Vietnamese
petroleum. Oil already accounts for more than half Japan's imports
from the Southeast Asian nation, which is impoverished but rich in
resource.

   Promises have been made a year after
Africans braved tear gas and gunfire to shout for democracy in more
than a dozen capitals, but not a single one-party government has
been unseated.
   Fifteen regimes have said they would accept multiparty rule, but
there is no sign that democratically elected administrations will
replace any of them soon.
   Leaders who could not crush protest movements with troops and
arrests have turned to delaying tactics. While paying lip service
to democracy with promises of free elections, critics say, they use
a bag of dirty tricks to stay in power.
   Those who mimicked the communist system and told their people to
look there for inspiration were taken at their word when East
Europeans started demanding freedom.
   After the collapse of Communist parties in the Soviet bloc, the
writing was on the wall for Africa's one-party governments. Western
nations that helped corrupt leaders, in order to keep them from the
Soviet orbit, found it difficult to justify more support.
   ``There is no true development without genuine democracy,''
Jacques Pelletier, the French minister in charge of relations with
Africa, said recently.
   France is a staunch advocate of aid to Third World countries,
but Pelletier's comments echoed those of African opposition
leaders, not governments.
   At a conference on Africa, Herman Cohen, U.S. assistant
secretary of state for African affairs, said governments that
resisted their people's demands for democracy would find themselves
``in an increasingly disadvantageous position'' in the competition
for aid.
   Bans on opposition parties have been lifted in six countries:
Benin, Cape Verde, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Sao Tome and Zaire.
   Nine have agreed to move toward ending one-party government, but
opposition parties are not yet operating. They are Angola,
Cameroon, Congo, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Somalia
and Zambia.
   The first show of unrest came from Benin, where protesters
stoned a statue of Lenin. They blamed the nation's bankruptcy on
the Marxist-Leninist ideology adopted by President Mathieu Kerekou,
who gained power in a coup, and demanded his resignation.
   Kerekou renounced communism in response and said his government
was writing a new constitution to liberalize the economy and
guarantee human rights. In a move later copied by President Mobutu
Sese Seko of Zaire, he appointed a transition government but set no
date for himself to step down.
   Mobutu shocked Zaire in April when, under intense pressure from
the United States and other Western backers, he said he would give
in to demands for multiparty democracy.
   Student unrest continued and Belgium, the former colonial power,
accused Zairean commandos in May of killing more than 100 at
Lubumbashi University. Mobutu's government claimed only one student
was killed and blamed local government officials.
   In November, six months after Mobutu legalized opposition
parties, soldiers still were breaking up their meetings.
   On NOv. 6, opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi said Mobutu had
ordered him prevented from leaving the country to meet with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III in the United States.
   Other leaders, like President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya,
Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and Joseph Momoh of Sierra Leone, have
said no to change and often have called out soldiers to enforce the
decision.
   Gabon moved closer to democracy than the others when President
Omar Bongo was forced to conduct the first multiparty general
election in 22 years.
   Several rounds of voting had to be held because voters smashed
ballot boxes, burned government cars and attacked officials they
claimed were rigging the election.
   Bongo emerged with a bare majority in the National Assembly, but
his term as president does not expire for three years.
   Ivory Coast held its first contested presidential election in
October. Police dispersed opposition campaign rallies with tear gas
and clubs. On election day, voters smashed ballot boxes and claimed
fraud.
   Government-controlled television and radio denied the opposition
access until the campaign was nearly over, then censored their
statements.
   Laurent Gbagbo, a history professor, was the only opposition
candidate. Two others could not raise bonds equivalent to $80,000
each, which the government announced as a requirement one week
before the 10-day campaign began.
   Everyone expected the victory of President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, the octogenarian who has ruled since independence
from France in 1960, but many doubt he got the 81.67 percent of the
vote his government claims.

   In a hollow square at the front of the plain,
wooden church, a group of singers wages musical warfare with a
song's harmony.
   They bellow notes at the top of their lungs to ``put the tune in
mind,'' singing a capella - without piano or other instrumental
help.
   Their sparse, strong harmonies vibrate through the wooden pews
in Chestnut Grove Baptist Church, as they read an oblong book in
which each of the four musical notes is shown with a different
shape - triangle, circle, rectangle and diamond - for easier
reading of the music.
   The singing is called Sacred Harp, shaped note or fasola. It was
common in the United States in the 19th century, but soon faded
because it was considered too crude by churches which instead
relied on imported compositions and a modern seven-note scale.
   Almost unknown outside Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and
Mississippi by the 1930s, it survived in the Deep South. Why?
Because as singer Buell Cobb says, ``You didn't have anyone
stomping around telling people it was no good.''
   But survival is no longer a question.
   The four-part a cappella harmonies are claiming passionate
converts from Chicago to California. They are drawn to the
primitive, deep sounds, and to the sense of community ``old book
singing'' brings to all who sing and who listen.
   In September, 400 ``shaped-note singers'' from 21 states
gathered in Chicago for a two-day convention of the United Sacred
Harp Musical Association. It was the first major fasola convention
outside the South in 87 years.
   The Northern resurrection of the genre came as fasola declined
in the South, where singing schools gave way to modern
entertainments. The singers, whose churches no longer relied on
circuit preachers, went to church each Sunday and attended singings
less often.
   ``Every year you lose about seven or eight all-day singings in
the South because there aren't enough singers to keep it up,'' said
Ted Mercer, the unofficial leader of the Chicago singers.
   Some of the Chicago singers are so committed to preserving the
music they want to retire in the South to sing more, he said.
   Kathleen Throw, a singer from St. Louis who was visiting Ider, a
town in northeast Alabama, believes that urban Northerners are
doubly appreciative of the sense of community that comes with
fasola singings.
   Singers often speak of being ``grabbed'' or ``knocked off my
feet'' when they first hear Sacred Harp signing.
   ``I was so stunned. ... They were singing at decibel levels I
didn't think the human voice could reach. I have never in my life
heard anything like it,'' Chicago singer Judy Hauff says of the
first singing she attended.
   The Chicago singers began with photocopies of Sacred Harp music,
searching out Hugh McGraw and his Sacred Harp Publishing Co. in
Breman, Ga. The company is working on the first major revision of a
Sacred Harp book since the 1930s, with 65 new songs.
   Hauff and Mercer returned to Chicago determined to have
authentic note-singings and all that went with them: dinner,
memorials and the singings.
   The all-day singing in Ider on the second Sunday each October,
listed in church records as early as 1927, is the old style at its
richest.
   Singers range from 87-year-old Leonard Lacy to 19-year-old
Jeffrey Wootten, and a mouth-watering noon meal of fried okra,
turnip greens, chicken and other favorites is set out.
   Unlike traditional choral music, Sacred Harp singing is not for
the audience, said Cobb, who's written ``The Sacred Harp,'' a
history of the music. ``We have become a society that watches
television, that ... watches other people do things. This is
something that you do yourself,'' he said.
   He believes the music represents an old rural way of life many
Southerners tried to escape. But that way of life attracts
non-Southerners, says Keith Willard, an AIDS researcher in
Minneapolis.
   ``I think it's hard for people in urban areas to achieve a sense
of community, to develop deep ties between neighbors. I'm a
scientist, used to dealing with things rationally, analytically.
This ... was like suddenly walking into a group of people and
feeling at home,'' he said.
   Willard, who helped organize the first all-day singing in
Minneapolis-St. Paul, appreciated the value of everyone's
participation.
   ``There are lots of people who appear not to be too far away
from death who are still coming and contributing and greatly
appreciated by the other singers for what they can pass on,'' he
said.
   Marcia Johnson, a Jewish lawyer from Chicago who concedes it's a
bit odd for her to be ``singing the praises of Jesus,'' says the
music has universal themes.
   ``I'm 52 years old and I sometimes used to think about whether
my friends or family would die before I did. I know now that as
long as there are singers, I will have people that I love and who
love me,'' she said.

   Today is Sunday, Nov. 25, the 329th day of 1990. There are 36
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On Nov. 25, 1963, the body of President Kennedy, assassinated in
Dallas three days earlier, was laid to rest at Arlington National
Cemetery, following a requiem Mass in Washington. At her husband's
grave site, Jacqueline Kennedy lighted an ``Eternal Flame'' that
burns to this day.
   On this date:
   In 1758, in the French and Indian War, the British captured Fort
Duquesne at what is now Pittsburgh.
   In 1783, the British evacuated New York, their last military
position in the United States during the Revolutionary War.
   In 1881, Pope John XXIII was born Angelo Roncalli in a village
near Bergamo, Italy.
   In 1920, radio station WTAW of College Station, Texas, broadcast

<HEAD>Senators Advance a Familiar Defense in Ethics Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From accused senators, a familiar defense:
they broke no laws, no Senate rules, breached no guidelines because
there were none. From an accuser, a suggestion that there is indeed
a guiding standard, and that it should lead a senator to avoid
conduct that would appear improper to a reasonable, intelligent
person.
   That draws a line that could prove more important than the
itemized inquiry into the conduct of five senators, under
investigation for their dealings in behalf of Charles H. Keating
Jr. and his effort to fend federal regulators away from his
now-failed savings and loan business.
   The Senate Ethics Committee and, eventually, voters will judge
the acts of the men involved in this case. The broader question of
congressional conduct will remain after those judgments have been
rendered. It will persist even if Congress reforms its campaign
finance system, writes regulations on dealings with and for
constituents who seek intervention with a federal agency.
   That's one of the things members of Congress do for a living.
The question in this case is whether it was done for Keating
because of his campaign contributions to the senators involved. He
once said he certainly hoped so.
   The senators insist they acted to make sure a constituent and an
employer was being treated properly by government regulators.
   Sen. Howell T. Heflin, D-Ala., chairman of the ethics panel,
summed up the dilemma in two observations as he opened the hearings
Thursday.
   ``Many of our fellow citizens apparently believe that your
services were bought by Charles Keating, that you were bribed, that
you sold your office, that you traded your honor and your good
names for contributions and other benefits,'' Heflin told the
accused senators.
   But he also warned against a standard of conduct that could make
Congress too timid in going to executive and regulatory agencies in
behalf of constituents with grievances.
   Outlining the case against the senators, Robert S. Bennett,
special counsel to the committee, said he agreed that members of
the Senate can properly pressure regulators.
   The difficult questions come in defining what is proper and
when.
   Bennett offered one answer in describing ``a well-recognized and
established appearance standard'' to govern conduct.
   ``A senator should not engage in conduct which would appear to
be improper to a reasonable, nonpartisan, fully informed person,''
Bennett said. ``Such conduct undermines the public's confidence in
the integrity of the government ad is an abuse of one's official
position. Such conduct is wrong in addition to appearing to be
wrong.''
   That has the ring of common sense. But it relies on the judgment
of the beholder.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., one of the accused senators, said
that under the guidelines Bennett wants applied, a senator would be
afraid to act in behalf of any constituent who had contributed to
his campaign, no matter how legitimate the issue.
   Then again, Keating was no ordinary contributor. He gave $49,000
for Cranston campaigns and $850,000 to voter registration funds the
senator was pushing.
   Cranston, who is suffering from prostate cancer and has said he
will not seek re-election in 1992, complained that Bennett wants to
judge the accused senators ``on the basis of rules which have never
been written and standards which have never been applied.'' He said
that deprives the five senators of guarantees the Constitution
grants every citizen.
   The other senators are Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich., John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz.
Bennett has recommended that the case against Glenn and McCain be
dismissed.
   The complaint that there are no rules so none were broken has
been heard before in congressional ethics cases.
   The late Sen. Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut raised it in
defending himself against ethics accusations in 1967, saying he
faced Senate discipline for rules formulated after the fact, by the
very committee that considered his case. He was censured by the
Senate for using funds raised through testimonials and campaign
solicitations ``for his personal benefit.'' Later, there were rules
on that conduct - it was sanctioned, so long as it was disclosed.
   When he quit as speaker of the House in 1989, Jim Wright claimed
there was uncertainty in the rules under which he was accused of
violating House restrictions on gifts and outside income. ``Members
are entitled to know what the rules mean,'' Wright said, suggesting
that the House set up an office of counsel to provide official
advice on ethical questions.
   In the current case, the decision of the committee and of the
Senate on the accused senators will draw lines for future conduct.
Without the campaign finance reforms that so far have failed to
pass Congress, there are sure to be more situations linking

   ``Unless these trends are recognized and dealt with, we will
have more cases like this,'' Bennett warned, ``and the reputation
of this body and its members will be in utter ruin.''

   Motown actually turned 30 almost two years
ago. But Sunday's two-hour CBS special, ``Motown 30: What's Goin'
On'' is worth the wait.
   It's not the star-studded musical spectacle that was ``Motown
25: Yesterday, Today, Forever,'' winner of a 1983 Emmy, an NAACP
Image Award, a Directors Guild of America trophy and a George
Foster Peabody award.
   It is full of stars and it is full of music. But this time, it
also is full of ballet, opera, filmmakers, humor and a marching
band.
   ``Motown 30'' is a retrospective of African-American
contributions to every aspect of the entertainment industry. And
while ``Motown 25'' gave us a moon-walking, one-gloved Michael
Jackson, its successor gives us a long look at how far black women
and men have come in this country.
   And how far we all have yet to go.
   The show was taped at the Hollywood Pantages theater on Oct. 22
before a formally attired, mostly black audience that included
Motown founder Berry Gordy and Sammy Davis Jr.'s widow, Altovise.
   But the four-hour event was no pompous, Hollywood affair. This
was a house party. And everyone was in the mood.
   The program opens with the Jackson State University marching
band thundering down Hollywood Boulevard blasting a funked-out
version of ``I Heard It Through The Grapevine.''
   Trumpets and tubas blaring, the gyrating formation marches into
the Pantages, down the aisles and onto the stage. The audience is
ecstatic.
   It goes uphill from there.
   The talent lineup includes Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder,
Terence Trent D'Arby, The Temptations, The Four Tops, Denzel
Washington, Robert Townsend, Tracy Chapman, Natalie Cole, Keenen
Ivory Wayans, Gladys Knight, Patti LaBelle and the Dance Theatre of
Harlem.
   Comedian Whoppi Goldberg, impersonating Diana Ross, talks about
the importance of Motown. Yeah, you could dance to it. Yeah,
everyone knew the words.
   But, ``it's also about a whole lot of other things, too - a
search for respect, a hunt for heroes, a pride in accomplishments,
all that good stuff,'' Goldberg says.
   ``A lot of us wanted to be a whole lot of things. We wanted to
be the Temptations, we wanted to be hip and cool and rich and happy
and some of us wanted to be white.
   ``But we've gotten over that.''
   Discrimination is a common thread through most of the show's
segments, from comedy bits to musical numbers to tributes to black
filmmakers.
   ``In 1960, TV Guide published an article called `What Does the
Negro Want from Television,''' says Keenen Ivory Wayans, creator
and executive producer of the hit Fox comedy series ``In Living
Color.''
   Retorts his brother and co-star, Damon, ``The same thing they
want in 1990. To be on it and get paid.''
   Singer, dancer, choreographer and TV director Debbie Allen
offers her memories of what the world looked like to a little black
girl who dreamed of being a ballerina.
   ``As a young girl, I had to have a great imagination to picture
myself as a ballet dancer,'' she says, introducing the Dance
Theatre of Harlem. ``Because in everything that I saw and in
everything that I read, I didn't see anyone who looked like me.''
   The music, from Gladys Knight fronting the 100-member Soul
Children of Chicago choir to a showdown between the Temptations and
the Four Tops, is a raucous blend of soul and gospel.
   Patti LaBelle and Michael Bolton team up (square off is more
like it) for a salute to the partnership of Marvin Gaye and Tammi
Terrell, ending with sweat-dripping rendition of ``You're All I
Need (To Get By).''
   LaBelle, not known for being a shrinking violet onstage, may
have gotten more than she bargained for with the equally unretiring
Bolton. The white boy held his own.
   Executive producer Suzanne dePasse, who won an Emmy for ``Motown
25,'' says this is the last birthday special. Motown will not turn
40. At least not on television.
   ``That was it,'' said the longtime colleague of Motown founder
Gordy, with whom she now heads Gordy-dePasse Productions (formerly
Motown Productions).
   ``This show was meant to do something else,'' DePasse said. ``I
will never be able to replace `Motown 25' in my own recollection.
That was the first time I was on a solo flight. In a way, this is a
wonderful farewell to that whole 22{-year segment of my life.''
   In the program's crowded finale, Stevie Wonder leads the
children's choir and every performer on the show through Marvin
Gaye's ``What's Goin' On.''
   Filmmaker Robert Townsend ends the night with this observation:
   ``We ain't where we should be. We ain't where we could be. But
thank God we ain't where we used to be.''

<HEAD>James Burke's `After the Warming' - Prophetic, Scary and
Entertaining</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's very simple how James Burke, host of
tonight's two-hour PBS special ``After the Warming,'' got involved
with the project.
   Burke, after all, is the British TV journalist whose top-rated
PBS series ``Connections'' and ``The Day the Universe Changed''
taught American TV audiences that science, culture and technology
could fascinate.
   ``Maryland Public Television asked me to do a program on global
warming and I said, `You mean the 175,000th program on global
warming?' And they said, `Do you think you can do something
different?' I said, `Yeah.'''
   That turned out to be a pretty big ``Yeah,'' even for Burke, who
spent seven months researching ``After the Warming,'' which was
filmed on four continents.
   At its heart is scientific opinion that it's likely the gases
emitted by our civilization - carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
oxide and the artificial CFCs - are warming up the planet.
   ``No one can answer that question until maybe the end of the
century,'' Burke acknowledged. ``If you think it's fractionally
more than 50 percent likely, then the odds are infinitely worse
than what you do when you spend money to insure your life and your
health and your house.
   ``If it's more likely than less likely, then we should insure
against it.''
   Using advanced video graphics and special effects, Burke creates
a ``virtual reality'' chamber of the 21st century.
   It is the year 2050, when the Planetary Management Authority
celebrates its 50th anniversary as the Earth's environmental policy
agency.
   Taking the greenhouse effect as a fait accompli, Burke lets us
``look back'' on history as a function of climate, and he does it
in the witty, erudite style that has endeared him to his fans.
   ``2050 was a way of saying, `Look, if you insure yourself, you
can end up with a world that isn't simply a result of the
greenhouse effect, but is the kind of world you should have
anyway,' '' Burke said.
   He chronicles ice ages, planetary orbital variations, the
emergence of human life, civilization, art, architecture, culture,
industrialization and colonialism as products of the influences of
nature on humankind.
   Then, suddenly, man's use of the planet for the first time
begins to influence nature and things get complicated.
   Burke ``looks back'' at how the nations of the world tried to
cope with the phenomenon. It is a sad, bumpy kind of history, with
human suffering, storms, floods, famine, political conflicts and a
new generation of boat people.
   Burke sees a planetary authority - a supranational, consensual,
non-authoritarian agency - as inevitable as ``carbon allocation
rights,'' which would force factory nations to buy surplus carbon
emission rights from non-industrialized nations.
   ``The greenhouse effect turns out to be the trigger for ...
handling the problem in the relationship between us and the Third
World and their economic aspirations,'' Burke said.
   ``Whether we like it or not, we did con them into taking all
that Arab oil money.
   ``Whether we like it or not we did turn them into service
agencies in the 19th century. And we did rape them and plunder and
pillage them and we did pollute the planet in doing so.
   ``We've got to face the fact that we are guilty of all these
things and do something straightforward about it.''
   ``I want people to realize this and then make their decisions.
They may just say, `Yes, we understand everything you say and they
can go hang.' Well, fine, but rather let them go hang on the basis
of a mature and informed decision.''
   There's another reason Burke agreed to do global warming: He was
in the midst of a financing hangup for ``The Complexity Effect,'' a
seven-hour TV series on the effect of information as the basic
force in evolutionary change.
   Here's a preview of that coming attraction:
   ``Information surges, in whatever form they come, always have
the same effect on all life forms,'' Burke said. ``They either
drive them to failure or they drive to success through increasing
complexity.
   ``For seven long, crucifyingly boring hours, I'm going to try to
prove that.''

<HEAD>We Have to Push the ``Off'' Button</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans have been having a terrible time
finding the ``stop spending'' button on the government's keyboard.
   The inability is astounding during a high-tech age in which one
worker at a computer console can direct an entire factory operation
or the flow of electricity through power lines, or raise almost any
statistic known to man.
   But finding the ``off'' button on spending, even under the
stress of an economy on the edge of recession, eludes them. The
country seems unable to go on an austerity budget after a decade of
spending and borrowing.
   The difficulty is more sharply defined each day in government,
where taxes rise while the economy weakens; in business, where
expenses rise but sales fall; in not-for-profit institutions, where
services grow but funds shrink.
   Of course, it's an old, old story in the typical American
household, which is being urged to spend more than before in spite
of what the Conference Board says is the biggest decline in
consumer confidence in two decades.
   Throughout the economy - among employers, employees, elected
officials, investors, bankers, brokers, borrowers - everyone seems
to be saying the same thing: stop spending. But few are able to
find and click the stop button.
   To many people, the most egregious example of the phenomenon was
in raising federal taxes while the economy flashed danger signs.
Consider some of them:
   - The Federal Reserve's monthly report on economic conditions
around the country showed each of the 12 districts reported either
slower growth or an actual decline in economic activity through
mid-October.
   - Construction contracts fell 2.8 percent in September, the
sharpest monthly drop since 1982. Machine tool orders declined 4.6
percent in September from the month before, putting them 13 percent
lower than the year-earlier level.
   - The National Association of Purchasing Managers' index of
manufacturing activity declined to 43.4 percent in October, the
fourth straight month of declines. Anything below 50 percent
indicates a shrinkage of activity.
   - In the first nine months of 1990, manufacturing failures rose
20 percent, non-manufacturing failures 14 percent, and services 8.5
percent, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet. Big debt - overspending -
played a large role, of course.
   - Since January, 600,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared,
and many thousands of jobs have been lost in banking, securities,
accounting, management consulting, health care and government.
Overspending had a lot to do wit it.
   - Initial claims of unemployment insurance have soared, and
those who remain working are likely to have shorter hours than
before. The average work week fell to 34.2 hours in October from
34.7 hours in September.
   But federal government spending, in spite of rhetoric to the
contrary, continued to rise. Now, so also are taxes.
   John Sloan, president of the National Federation of Independent
Business, comments that ``small-business owners feel betrayed by
Congress raising their taxes.'' Main Street, he said, is not a
happy place these days.
   Why can't the ``stop spending'' key be found? How can so many
people call for the key to be tapped but then find it so difficult
to find?
   Perhaps it is because minds were programmed during the 1980s, a
decade of easy credit, free spending and low saving - and among
those programmed, it seems, were the very ones who should have been
taught to find the key.

<HEAD>Former Ideological Opponents Become Trade Partners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Less than two years ago, South
Africa and Eastern Europe shunned each other as ideological
villains.
   Today, the South Africans have diplomatic or trade arrangements
with Poland, Romania and Hungary, and are expanding contacts with
the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia.
   Dramatic political and social changes on both sides have made
them eager to renew relations after decades of enmity over
communism and apartheid.
   ``We were at the other end of the world, both geographically and
ideologically,'' Foreign Minister R.F. Botha said on a trip to
Czechoslovakia. ``After the changes in both parts of the world,
there is nothing which divides our governments.''
   Botha and Czechoslovak officials announced plans to establish
low-level diplomatic ties after a 27-year hiatus. In August, Trade
Minister Kent Durr became the first South African Cabinet member to
visit the Soviet Union in 34 years.
   Ideology drove the two sides apart in the 1950s and 1960s.
Economics is bringing them together in the 1990s.
   The South African government invoked the threat of a communist
takeover for decades as justification for suppressing the black
opposition.
   This year, President F.W. de Klerk legalized all opposition
groups, released African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
from prison after 27 years and promised to end the apartheid system
of racial segregation.
which have isolated South Africa economically and politically.
   East European countries supported the sanctions and backed the
ANC and its ally, the South African Communist Party.
   Then, in 1989, came the upheaval that dismembered the Soviet
bloc and swept Communist parties from power in Moscow's former
satellites. Those nations are struggling to rebuild their crumbling
economies and have found a willing trade partner in South Africa.
   Although they still oppose apartheid, East European countries
have switched from being the main financial support of the ANC to
dealing with the white government it sought to destroy.
   Delegations from Eastern Europe visit South Africa regularly.
Permananent representatives have been exchanged and trade
agreements signed. Thousands of Eastern European and Soviet
citizens have applied to South African embassies in Western Europe
for permission to immigrate.
   ``I am pleased that the dynamics of late 20th century political
transformation are bringing our two nations once again closer
together,'' Durr said in opening the first Polish trade fair in
South Africa.
   Poland dropped trade restrictions against South Africa on March
9, the day after Durr completed a visit. In late October, the
governments signed an agreement to establish reciprocal offices of
interest.
   Polish government and trade officials traveled to South Africa
for the two-week trade fair, which featured nearly 50 manufacturers
of products ranging from heavy machinery through textiles to vodka.
Organizers said contracts worth $60 million were signed.
   The visitors emphasized their continued opposition to apartheid,
but it was clear that relations had been made more palatable by
Poland's economic problems and South Africa's reforms.
   ``Poland is heavily in debt'' and is beginning to make its
economic relations with the rest of the world ``much more active,''
said Andrzej Zawislak, an economist and member of Parliament.
   Zawislak said some Western countries had urged Poland not to
establish ties with South Africa, but did not identify them.
   Romania and South Africa signed an agreement last month for a
joint trade committee that would meet annually, and specific trade
contracts are expected.
   South Africa has opened a permanent office in Hungary to
represent its interests and Hungary plans to reciprocate.
   Hungarian officials said their country still opposes apartheid,
but wants the office because about 20,000 people of Hungarian
descent live in South Africa.
   African nations also are warming to South Africa's reforms. Only
Malawi has full diplomatic relations, but several have trade
missions in Pretoria and de Klerk has visited seven African
countries since taking office in August 1989.
   His government says it trades with every African country, mostly
in secret.
   Mandela has sought funds for the ANC in Africa, Western Europe,
the United States and Asia, but has yet to visit Eastern Europe or
the Soviet Union, which provided most of the movement's military
aid while he was imprisoned.

<HEAD>`Godfather III' Heads Christmas Movie Season in a Year Without
Usual Glut</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The film crowd expects ``The Godfather III''
to climax a near-record year in a holiday season without the usual
glut of big-budget and possible Academy Award movies.
   Francis Ford Coppola's continuation of the bloody Corleone saga
arrives on Christmas Day, giving it only one week to augment the
1990 box-office total.
   ``If `Godfather III' had been released on Nov. 21 as scheduled,
it might have contributed to another record year,'' says Daily
Variety's Art Murphy. ``Barring a miracle, the year's total will be
$4.9 billion, only $100 million behind 1989's record. The spring
was sensational, with three $100 million-films. The summer was the
second-best ever, and so was the fall. It has been a good year.''
   This holiday season will bring only 12 films in wide release,
compared to 20-25 in the early 1980s. About 10 others will receive
limited releases to enhance their prestige and Oscar chances.
   Some of the pre-Thanksgiving movies will remain in the
marketplace through New Year's. ``Dances With Wolves'' will
certainly be among them. Other possibilities: ``Rocky V,'' ``The
Rescuers Down Under,'' ``Three Men and a Little Lady,'' ``Predator
II.''
   Here are the attractions seeking big audiences in December:
   - ``Kindergarten Cop'' features Arnold Schwarzenegger returning
with his ``Twins'' director Ivan Reitman in a comedy with kids and
action.
   - ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' stars Tom Hanks, Melanie
Griffth and Bruce Willis in Tom Wolfe's novel of urban corruption,
directed by Brian DePalma (``The Untouchables'').
   - ``Awakenings'' is another change of pace for Robin Williams,
based on a real-life story of a doctor who revives catatonic
patients. With Robert De Niro and directed by Penny Marshall
(``Big'').
   - ``Misery'' has Rob Reiner (``When Harry Met Sally...'')
turning serious with a Stephen King novel, starring James Caan and
Kathy Bates.
   - ``Mermaids'' represents Cher's return to films after the
Oscar-winning ``Moonstruck.'' With Winona Ryder and Bob Hoskins.
   - ``Look Who's Talking Too'' is a reprise of last year's hit,
with Roseanne Barr joining Bruce Willis as a baby's voice.
   - ``The Rookie'' features Clint Eastwood returning to the police
force after bombing as ``White Hunter, Black Heart.''
   - ``Almost an Angel'' teams Paul Hogan and new wife Linda
Kozlowski in a comedy unrelated to the ```Crocodile'Dundee'' films
that introduced them.
   Here are other films that will have less impact on the 1990
total because of limited releases, but will be heard from in 1991:
   - ``Havana'' reunites Robert Redford and Sydney Pollack (``Out
of Africa'') for a love story against the backdrop of the Cuban
revolution.
   - ``Russia House'' stars Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer in
the John le Carre spy thriller.
   - ``Green Card'' offers the American film debut of Gerard
Depardieu as a French immigrant in a marriage of convenience with
Andie McDowall (``sex, lies and videotape'').
   - ``Edward Scissorshands'' is another fantasy from Tim Burton
(``Batman,'' ``Beetlejuice'').
   - ``Alice'' has Woody Allen writing and directing but not
acting. William Hurt, Mia Farrow and Alec Baldwin do perform.
   - ``The Sheltering Sky'' is a love story by Berardo Bertolucci
(``The Last Emperor'') with Debra Winger and John Malkovich.
   - ``Hamlet'' stars the commercially viable Mel Gibson and Glenn
Close, directed by Franco Zeffirelli.
   - ``Come See the Paradise'' is an interracial romance during the
wartime internment of Japanese-Americans.
   - ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge'' stars Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward
as an aging Kansas City couple.
political story directed by Bruce Berensford (``Driving Miss
Daisy'').
   Even with a lesser number of films in wide release, that's a
carload of movies to be considered by audiences, critics and,
importantly, Academy voters. But the six-week year-end market
comprises 13 per cent to 14 per cent of the year's box office, and
companies save some of their best attractions for this period.
   ``Like any producer I think it's bad to be playing all your
cards at once,'' comments veteran filmmaker Howard W. Koch (``The
ODd Couple,'' ``Airplane''). ``Many of the films will open big, but
can they hang in there? The secret to big grosses is the repeat
trade. That's what has happened with `Ghost' (which Koch helped
produce). People are going back again and again.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - There is a widespread disease of the brain that
most doctors fail to diagnose in adults because many of its
symptoms are so vague. Even its victims have trouble defining them.
But progress is on the horizon that will help doctors identify and
treat the symptoms.

   AS many as 7 million American adults may be
suffering from a brain disorder they don't know they have. It's an
affliction first described in the medical literature in 1902, but
its name is still being debated.
   The disorder, once thought to affect only children, is best
known as the hyperactive child syndrome. It is now called Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Residual Type (ADHD,RT), when it
persists into adulthood.
   ``Most of these adults know something is wrong, but they don't
know what,'' says Dr. Alan Zametkin, a psychiatrist and researcher
at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.
   ``The attention deficit is like a fever. It tells you something
is wrong, but it doesn't tell you what. A lot of things disrupt
attention - depression, anxiety, schizophrenia.''
   Up to 85 percent of those afflicted could be helped with
medication, if they knew they needed it.
   It was once thought that a hyperactive child treated with a mild
stimulant, Ritalin, would outgrow the disorder by puberty. That is
still true in some cases. But researchers now believe the disorder
persists into adulthood in 40 percent to 60 percent of all cases.
   The disorder is the most common reason for a child to be
referred to mental health professionals.
   Scientists now know that outward hyperactivity is not always a
symptom, but that is the most common manifestation among children.
A child appears motor driven, cannot concentrate, cannot stay in
his seat, acts impulsively, cannot wait for his or her turn, speaks
out in the classroom, cannot cope with stress, bullies classmates,
has few social skills and an insatiable need for attention.
   It is generally accepted that five times more boys than girls
suffer the disorder, but one Yale pediatrician feels that girls are
greatly undercounted.
   The disorder, untreated, can destroy lives.
   One married woman, now in her 50s, always knew something was
wrong, but her doctors could never pin it down. She knew she wasn't
stupid, or depressed, or anxious, or whatever the diagnosis was.
   It was something she just couldn't describe, the difficulties of
her life. Everything was too hard, required too much effort. She
had to concentrate intently to perform such rote chores as making a
bed. She chose to remain childless for fear of passing this
disability on to a baby.
   But science is making progress toward helping people like her.
   IN mid-November, Zametkin announced in the New England Journal
of Medicine a new finding that defines a specific abnormality in
the brains of attention deficit victims. ``This is the first large
study of hyperactivity that shows some sort of metabolic
abnormality,'' he said.
   The brain is essentially two brains, the primitive brain below
and the cognitive brain above, sometimes referred to as the horse
and rider.
   Zametkin's study of 50 hyperactives and 50 normal people found
brain metabolism significantly lower in 30 of 60 specific brain
regions among the hyperactives.
   Commenting on the study, Dr. Paul H. Wender of the University of
Utah said that the basic cause may not be in the lessened activity
in the cortex or upper brain.
   ``If the more primitive centers don't tell the guys upstairs to
wake up, they won't have attention. But the problem is not in the
cortex, it's the guys downstairs.''
   Dr. Ivan Goldberg, a New York City psychiatrist specializing in
psychopharmacology and treating some adult cases, says, ``The
reason the diagnosis is often missed is that it is never even
considered.''
   One who agrees is Dr. Barry Garfinkel, director of child and
adolescent psychiatry at the University of Minnesota. He is
chairman of the committee that will seek to redefine and perhaps
rename the disorder for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, the
next diagnostic bible due out 1993.
   ``We trained doctors to believe Attention Deficit Hyperactive
Disorder disappeared with adolescence,'' Garfinkel says. ``The
patients knew better.''
   The absence of hyperactivity makes diagnosis less likely. SUch
was the case with one man blessed with extraordinary intellectual
gifts.
   ``I claw for every word in reading, writing and speaking,'' says
the man, who asked not to be identified. He appears laconic as he
struggles for precisely the right word.
   His brain is cursed by a chemical imbalance. It moves at the
anguished gait of a tortoise. For him, to utilize his mental gifts
requires great effort.
   ``With medication, I've had visions of things as they might
be,'' he says. ``There were brief periods when I could hear myself
think, where the competing thoughts were drowned out and I could
focus on one thing.''
   To add to his woes, he is one of the few whose response to
medication isn't satisfactory.

   With an IQ at the genius level, the best he can do in the
marketplace is to hold down a job in a mail room.
   ``I feel I let my whole family down,'' he says. ``I should have
been an honor to them and to myself, almost in an Oriental sense. I
feel a voice that says, `You had this great gift and you did
nothing with it.'''
   This man had seen about 20 psychiatrists and psychologists and
received a variety of diagnoses - from obsessive compulsive to
depression to anxiety. He jokes that he talked his current
psychiatrist into what he feels is probably the correct diagnosis.
   He probably suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder without
being hyperactive.
   Although in the medical literature for nearly 90 years, the
disorder has gone through a variety of names: minimal brain
impairment, minimal brain dysfunction, hyperkinesis (the
hyperactive child), Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) in the DSM
III, a name some prefer to the name given in the 1987 revision
which calls it Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),
making the hyperactivity a core of the syndrome.
   Researchers say the affliction strikes 3 percent to 6 percent of
all children and in about two-thirds of the cases it is coupled
with specific developmental disorders, the most common warships, barges,
freighters - more
than 5,000 ships dead at the bottom in water so deep and cold and
black that a scuba diver can lose sense even of which way is up.
   These antiquities of the inland seas are in jeopardy, made
vulnerable by technology. Cold water diving is safer, cheaper than
it used to be. The wrecks are easier to fid, easier to loot.
   Now the Great Lakes graveyards have become battlegrounds in an
underwater war. On the one side are divers who believe in
finders-keepers, an accepted notion to many ever since diving
became a common man's sport in the 1970s. On the other are those
who regard the relics as a national trust, a well-preserved
chronicle of America's history.
   Enforcement officers from Michigan to Ontario say the laws to
stop such looting are impossible to police. There are too many
wrecks, too many divers. So some preservationists have taken
matters into their own hands.
   On the western shore of Lake Huron, for instance, amateur
archaeologists have become a band of undersea vigilantes. After
work, the unlikely crusaders - three schoolteachers and a county
sheriff's detective - strap on heavy air tanks and roll backward
into the Lake Huron surf to visit the wreck of the North Star.
   The freighter went down on Nov. 25, 1908, impaled upon the bow
of its sister ship, the Northern Queen. The Queen took on the
Star's crew, broke free of the ships' death embrace and made it to
shore. The Star, with its cargo of flour and wheat and shingles,
burbled to the bottom.
   This time the divers take with them a reporter. Cold water
streams in beneath the skin of neoprene dive suits, so shocking the
reporter curses. The weight of the water drills like a spike into a
tender eardrum.
   The divers descend, fading into the green dark. The reporter
hangs back, waiting for the pressure to equalize and relieve her
aching ear. She hangs alone on a line stretched from ship to
shipwreck, bouncing wildly as the topside vessel, the Sand Dollar,
rolls with the growing swells.
   Then, hand under hand, she slides along the rope. Sixty feet
down, the North Star emerges, disappears, emerges again, ghostlike
in a snowstorm of algae and muck.
   In the cold and the dark, the reporter pulls upward, measures
her breathing, then drops onto the giant engines of the 1908 wreck.
Three stories deeper, Sanilac County Sheriff's Sgt. Garry Biniecki,
one of the first to descend, moves along the 300-foot hull, taking
pictures, making measurements.
   They have 23 minutes to scour the wreck before the gases
dissolving in their bloodstreams force them up. All the while,
nitrogen in their air tanks transforms into a drug and they feel
the titillating but deadly rapture of the deep.
   Biniecki and his comrades will bring back nothing more tangible
than exposed rolls of film and scribbled measurements. They have a
new ethic. What goes down stays down. Nothing is for the taking.
   ``We want to keep our artifacts down there,'' says team member
Jim Stayer, a high school science teacher and the Sand Dollar's
captain.
   Skirmishes between followers of the new ethic and the old have
taken some unusual turns. A researcher for a museum, a
professional, stole an artifact from a wreck when one he took
legally for the museum broke. He was caught. A team of divers,
amateurs all, chained and padlocked the steering wheel of another
wreck to prevent its theft. It remains in place.
   One LAke Michigan charter captain enforces his no-souvenirs
policy by searching customers when they surface from wreck dives.
   Steve Harrington, a writer about shipwrecks who has converted to
the new ethic, confesses he still feels unclean because he once
took spikes from a wreck. ``It sounds corny, future generations and
all,'' he says, ``but it's hard to look young divers in the eye.''

   The Great Lakes - Huron, Erie, Ontario, Michigan and Superior -
were for a period rich in history and lore, the main American
arteries of commerce.
   Timber to build cities floated down from the Canadian shores.
Iron ore to make steel sailed out of Superior. Grain, stone, coal
and copper filled cargo holds, but the ships also carried human
cargo and their belongings, fur traders, immigrants, pioneers,
laborers, homesteaders.
   The wooden boats and steel freighters never were a match for the
sudden fury of the inland seas, where unexpected west winds in an
afternoon can drive up waves three stories high.
   The Great Storm of 1913, a six-day blow, sank 10 ships and
killed 235 seamen. Gales from 1878 to 1898 ravaged nearly 6,000
ships and sank more than 1,000 of them.
   Modern ships have fared little better. In 1964, a Huron storm
tore the ore freighter Daniel J. Morell in half. Only one of its
crew of 29 survived. Eleven years later the freighter Edmund
Fitzgerald and its crew of 29 went down in Superior seconds after
the captain radioed that he was holding his own.
   The Great Lakes have become an archaeologist's paradise. Where
the water is deep and cold, decay is arrested and each wreck
remains a frozen moment of history.
   The preservation is so remarkable that bodies can last for
years, skeletons for centuries. Archaeologists excavating the wreck
of the Rockaway in Lake Michigan found the remains of salted meat
in the galley and rope made from corn leaves still sitting in a pot
used to mix caulking. The schooner went down in 1891.
   ``The sort of Hollywood concept of what a shipwreck looks like
actually exists in the Great Lakes,'' said Rockaway archaeologist
Ken Pott from his museum in South Haven, Mich. ``Short of a
skeleton lashed to the wheel, it's all there.''
   For example, the Hamilton and the Scourge, two Canadian
battleships from the war of 1812, went down in 300 feet of water in
Lake Ontario. Pott says a searcher using submersible cameras found
the ship intact, replete with cutlasses, cannons, guns, bones and
masts.
   But the conservation work of maritime archaeologists such as
Pott is up against an army of black marketeers and souvenir
seekers.
   Simple wood blocks that litter wrecks by the hundreds fetch $500
in an antiques store. COllectors will pay $10,000 for a ship's bell
or a wood steering wheel. A carved ship's figurehead is almost
priceless.
   Such stripping was legal in Michigan until 1980, when the state
passed a law allowing salvage only under permit. Wisconsin only
recently toughened its law. All of the Great Lakes states and
Ontario outlaw stripping to some degree. But some, such as
Michigan, are willing to grant salvage permits, especially to
divers picking up things for museums.
   Archaeological surveys take years. The pillage can occur
overnight. Witness the fate of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter
Mesquite.
   That crippled buoy tender was buried at sea last July, dropped
intact to the bottom of Lake Superior.
   The stripping started immediately: dinner plates from the boat's
galley, tools from the work rooms, hard hats from lockers, dress
jackets out of the closets of crew members.
   ``I am appalled at what happened,'' says Michigan archaeologist
John Halsey in Lansing. ``It was like a feeding frenzy. We're
talking in hours, in days.''
   Because of that, many explorers go to great pains to hide their
discoveries. Charles Feltner, an engineer for Ford Motor Co., found
the 1856 wreck of the brig Sandusky in the Straits of Mackinac. He
dove on it for years in secrecy. Then he made the find public.
   ``People stripped the thing in a couple of months,'' Feltner
says. ``Things like dishes, tools, all the blocks, belaying pins,
deadeyes, you name it.''
   The ship's rams head figurehead remains. Divers bolted it back
down after someone tried to steal it, too.
   That was 10 years ago. Feltner thinks the advent of divers such
as Biniecki signals a change in ethic. Today, Feltner feels, the
looting would take years, not months.
   ``It's still bad enough to where divers 25 years from now aren't
going to have much to look at,'' Feltner says. ``The whole idea of
seeing a virgin wreck will be gone.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - George McGovern, professor turned politician,
has returned to his roots. At 68, he's back on a college campus,
teaching once again. The one-time presidential candidate says the
campaign trail still has its lure. That forum, he believes, can be
an attractive classroom itself.

   Heads turn and passers-by smile in
recognition when George McGovern walks along the stone paths of the
Cornell University campus.
   ``You probably get this all the time, but when I turned 18, you
were the first person I voted for,'' says a faculty member, beaming
as he shakes hands with the former senator from South Dakota and
1972 Democratic presidential nominee.
   McGovern smiles, thanks the man and chats briefly before moving
on. He does get that all the time, ever since his unsuccessful bid
for the presidency. ``It's nice,'' he says.
   Since losing his Senate seat in 1980, McGovern has been teaching
at colleges across the nation. This semester he is at Cornell,
where hundreds of students vied for spots in his once-weekly class
on American foreign policy.
   Teaching is a return to his roots for McGovern. He began his
career in 1949 as a history professor at South Dakota's tiny Dakota
Wesleyan University. He spent most of the next three decades
outside the classroom, making a name in state and national politics
and challenging the United States' role in the war in Vietnam. But
McGovern says he never stopped considering himself a teacher.
   ``That historic perspective has frequently given me a different
view of events,'' he says.
   ``I really knew quite a lot about Vietnam before we ever got
involved. And I always thought if you looked critically and closely
at the history of Vietnam, we might never have gone in there.''
   McGovern is 68 now. His hair and eyebrows have turned almost
white, and the creases on his forehead have deepened in the years
he has been out of the national spotlight.
   Dressed in a dark blue pinstripe suit and wearing thick black
plastic-rimmed bifocals that he takes on and off as he speaks, he
looks more like an elder statesman than a maverick politician who
challenged the establishment throughout his tenure in office.
   The tall ex-senator cuts an imposing figure at Cornell. His
steady voice with a hint of Midwestern twang easily hushes the 300
young people crowded into Statler Hall, a blue and purple-toned
auditorium in the college's hotel administration school.
   McGovern lectures in a conversational style, sprinkling his talk
with references to his own involvement in shaping the nation's
history. He tells students he doesn't want to be too partisan -
although he leaves little doubt where he stands - and he sounds
more regretful than angry when he speaks of policies he opposes.
   In a lecture on the Cold War, McGovern traces Republican attacks
on the Democrats for ``losing'' China and being soft on communism
to the GOP's frustration over having lost five consecutive national
elections.
   ``It set off a kind of political fury on the part of the
Republicans,'' he says. ``I can understand that,'' he adds,
laughing. ``After you've lost so many times you get to the point
where you want to get somebody - you just want to hit anybody.''
   He says the public had an exaggerated fear of the communist
threat that dogged him throughout his political career, he says. He
and others that called for negotiation, not confrontation, were
labeled appeasers, or worse.
   ``I have no doubt at all I'd still be in the Senate if not for
this fear,'' he says.
   Most of the students filling the lecture hall were still in
diapers when McGovern ran for president and not yet in high school
when he left the Senate. But they say they knew his name and the
views he represents.
   ``I knew that he was a big liberal,'' says Audrey Van Voden, a
government major from Syracuse.
   ``I just knew he ran for president,'' says Julie Brof, a policy
Analysis major from New York, adding that she thinks his class is
``fabulous.''

   At the end of class, McGovern allows time for questions. No one
leaves the auditorium. A student asks about political role models,
and McGovern mentions Adlai Stevenson, a fellow would-be president.
   ``Stevenson got me into politics, and that's probably enough to
persuade some people that he had an evil influence,'' he says,
chuckling.
opposition to the Vietnam War.
   ``It just so happens I had dinner with Sen. Fulbright last
week,'' McGovern says. Fulbright, he adds, is most proud of the
student exchange program he established in his first year in office
in 1942, not the Vietnam hearings he presided over.
   Responding to another student's question, McGovern dismisses the
impact of communism in the United States.
   ``Anyone here ever meet a real livemember of the Communist
Party?'' he asks. One student raises his hand. ``What did he look
like?'' McGovern asks, joining the audience in laughter.
   After class, McGovern lingers for one-on-one conversations with
the eager students who swarm around him. Brof asks him to meet with
the campus Democratic organization and leaves delighted when
McGovern offers to have breakfast with the group.
   ``I wish I had been around when he ran for president,'' she
sighs. ``I was 2 years old.''
   After class, over lunch in the hotel school's restaurant,
McGovern says he hasn't ruled out running for president again if
the opportunity presents itself. He misses the national forum of
the Senate and, especially, of a presidential campaign.
   ``Whether you win or lose, tens of millions of people hear
you,'' he says. ``I do miss that. If I really thought in any given
campaign that I could get across certain ideas to the American
public, I might run for president just to make the case.''
   McGovern blames recent leaders for failing to set a more
altruistic example for the next generation. The Reagan-Bush years,
he says, ``reassured people that greed is all right, that raw
competition with one's fellow human beings is the way things should
be.''
   He sees the effects of that leadership on students, he says,
reluctantly criticizing the young people who have always been among
his biggest fans.
   ``There's still a little too much materialism and not enough
idealism,'' he says. ``I don't want to say that in any harsh way.
It's just a mild disappointment on my part, that material values
still seem to dominate much more than any idealism.''
   But that materialism may be waning, McGovern says. He hears it
in the questions students ask and sees it in their growing activism
on issues such as the environment. He says he senses a growing
desire for leaders who will put the interests of the public first.
   ``I think there's a quickening of interest now,'' he says. ``It
isn't as strong as it was in the '60s, but I do think there's a
modest comeback. The trend is in the right direction.''
   McGovern looks out the restaurant window at students rushing
across the campus below. He has high hopes for the future those
young people represent, and for the history that is yet unwritten.
   Perhaps, he says, the dramatic crumbling of East-West
differences over the past year means that the world is finally
going to figure out how to live in peace. Even the Persian Gulf
crisis may have a silver lining, in that the United Nations is
emerging as an effective forum for resolving international
problems, he says.
   ``For many years I have believed that what is now happening
could have happened,'' McGovern says.
   ``I guess I've always been an optimist. I don't know how you can
live any other way and get much out of life.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - The struggle between the Inkatha Freedom Party
of Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and African National Congress of
Nelson Mandela has claimed some 6,000 lives since 1986. Some fear
the struggle is the prelude to a full-fledged civil war in South
Africa. Here's a look at MAndela's enigmatic rival, a chieftain who
extols Zulu warrior traditions but advocates non-violence in
dealing with the white government.

   Zulu chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, one of South Africa's most powerful black leaders, is an
enigma, equally comfortable in various guises.
   One moment he is in sharp business suits discussing free
enterprise with world leaders, the next he is attired in leopard
skins with spear in hand, leading Zulu war dances.
   Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party and head of the
Kwazulu black homeland, portrays himself as a moderate, but his
views are rejected by growing numbers of blacks.
   He advocates non-violent resistance to apartheid and working
with whites, but his followers battle black opponents. He advocates
free enterprise, although many blacks favor socialism. He has
alienated many blacks by saying that ending apartheid won't solve
their problems.
   Supporters, including many whites, see Buthelezi as the one
black leader who can find a way for whites and blacks to live
together in peace. Followers hail him as a pragmatist who refuses
to make empty political promises.
   Critics, who are more numerous, denounce Buthelezi as a tribal
warlord, a sellout to apartheid who wants power at any price. They
equate Buthelezi with the dictators who rule many black African
nations and accuse him of inciting black factional violence that
has claimed thousands of lives.
   Patrick Lekota, a senior official of the rival African National
Congress, accuses Buthelezi of being a pawn of the ruling National
Party.
   ``Buthelezi is the National Party's dog. ... De Klerk must rein
in his dog,'' he told a recent meeting.
   President F.W. de Klerk's government, which has promised to end
apartheid, has toyed with the idea of an alliance with Inkatha, a
``rainbow coalition'' of blacks and whites that would be a
formidable political force.
   Some observers say ambition and personality differences are the
root of Buthelezi's conflict with other black groups. Disillusioned
former supporters accuse Buthelezi of being despotic and unable to
accept criticism.
   ``His goal is to amass as much black support as possible so he
becomes the leader of black South Africans,'' says Zwelake Sisulu,
a top black journalist.
   Buthelezi hits back at critics who accuse him of inciting tribal
warfare.
   ``I am accused of murderous warmongering, which I strenuously
refute. I loathe the sickening murder and mayhem that is causing
untold suffering,'' he said in an Oct. 4 letter to The New York
Times.
   Whatever the truth, most observers agree Buthelezi will play a
major role in deciding South Africa's future.
   The struggle between Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party and the
African National Congress of Nelson Mandela has claimed some 6,000
lives since 1986. Some fear the struggle is the prelude to a
full-fledged civil war.
   Independent observers say both sides have helped incite the
violence.
   One of several hereditary chiefs and princes of the Zulu royal
house, Buthelezi says he is determined to destroy apartheid, but he
is ready to compromise with whites for peace.
   For years, Buthelezi has said only peaceful negotiation and
non-violent resistance can end apartheid. He insists the white
minority must be assured their future is secure, even if it means
blacks have to settle for less.
   ``My ideal is one person, one vote in a unitary state,'' he said
in a published interview. ``But I have always said we cannot afford
to destroy the country in seeking that.''
   It is a message that appeals to many whites, fearful of losing
their wealth under any future black government. But Buthelezi's
message enrages many blacks, who have lived in poverty for
generations with no political rights, and they accuse him of
toadying to whites.
   While other black opposition groups tend to blame apartheid for
most of the suffering endured by blacks, Buthelezi warns that the
end of apartheid will just be the start of their struggle for
emancipation. He warns blacks that they can only be free when they
liberate themselves as individuals by hard work.
   ``Many people have nurtured illusions that will never come
about. Once the euphoria (of freedom) passes, we will return to the
real world where the problems remain the same,'' he said in an
interview.
   The ANC and other groups call for redistribution of wealth from
whites to blacks and favor some form of socialism. Many blacks
equate capitalism with apartheid, saying it has only benefited
whites.

   James Garner says he liked the script for
``Decoration Day'' so much it prompted him to break his rule of
preparing for a role. He read the book from which the TV movie was
adapted.
   Garner plays a retired judge in the two-hour drama, set in
Georgia in 1975. The judge comes to the aid of a black man who
refuses to accept a Medal of Honor for heroism won 31 years earlier
in World War II.
   ``I hardly ever read the book after the script,'' Garner says.
``You lose so much between the book and the script.
   ``The problem is that when you're doing it you remember
something from the book that's not in the script. You don't want to
fall into that trap. It was probably left out for a reason.''
   The drama, a Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation on NBC on
Sunday, was adapted by Robert Lenski from the novella by the late
John William Corrington.
   ``I was familiar with the author's work,'' Garner says. ``I'd
read several of his books. He lived in New Orleans until he died
about a year ago.''
   Garner says that at this point in his acting career he looks for
quality scripts.
   ``I want things that have to do with people and the human
condition,'' he says. ``I don't think you have to blow up cities
and kill people to entertain. It's a pleasant script. `Murphy's
Romance' was pleasant.
   ``I had an opportunity to buy `Rambo.' This guy blows up a whole
town and kills half the National Guard because a cop offends him.
What kind of morality is that?''
   In ``Decoration Day,'' the Defense Department suddenly realizes
it has overlooked giving the medal to the black veteran. He refuses
the medal on principle. And when his former employer writes the
letter of refusal a government lawyer fears a white conspiracy to
block the presentation.
   Garner's character is Albert Sidney Finch, who retired from the
bench after the death of his wife. Bill Cobbs is Gee Penniwell, a
black veteran of World War II and a boyhood friend of Finch's until
they grew apart.
   Judith Ivey is a legal secretary who becomes close to Finch when
she prepares his case for Penniwell. Ruby Dee is Finch's
housekeeper, Norm Skaggs is his nephew, Jennifer Robertson is his
nephew's wife and Larry Fishburne is the government lawyer.
   ``You wait for something wonderful to come along,'' says Garner,
who starred in the TV series ``Maverick'' and ``The Rockford
Files'' and such movies as ``The Great Escape,'' ``The
Americanization of Emily,'' ``Grand Prix,'' ``Victor-Victoria'' and
``Murphy's Romance.''
   ``Decoration Day'' is the third Hall of Fame drama for Garner,
who previously starred in ``Promise'' and ``My Name is Bill W,''
and the eighth for producer Marian Rees. Robert Markowitz directed
on location in Georgia, although the original story was set in
Louisiana.
   ``I wear an `Indiana Jones' hat that was given to me years ago
by Stuart Margolin,'' Garner says. ``I had the brim cut down. It's
one of those things you pull out of the closet. Most of the
wardrobe is mine. The pants, the fishing vest. It works better if
you wear things that are yours.''
   Garner, who was wounded in combat in the Korean War, says he can
identify with a veteran offered a medal years later.
   ``When I was doing `Tank' I mentioned that I had never received
the Purple Heart,'' he says. ``I was with the 24th Division. Our
position had been overrun and all the records had been lost. So as
a PR thing the Army gave me the medal. So the fact that they want
to give this man the Medal of Honor 31 years later makes sense to
me. It happened to me.''
   Garner's first major movie after the war was ``Sayonara,'' a
1957 film in which he played a Marine pilot.
   ``I was doing `Sayonara' when Warner Bros. was looking at every
actor in Hollywood for `Maverick,''' he says. ``Then they noticed
me in the dailies and said, `Let's use him. He's already under
contract.' I did the pilot, and when I got back from Japan I
started `Maverick.'
   ``I got $500 a week the first season, with no residuals. I got
$600 the second year, $1,250 the third year. My competition was Ed
Sullivan, who got $25,000 a week.''
   Both ``Maverick'' and ``The Rockford Files'' are considered
television classics.
   ``It's all luck,'' Garner says. ``No, it's not all luck, but
there was a lot of luck involved.''
   He doubts he will do another series.
   ``People have no idea how hard an hour-long series is,'' he
says. ``Even if I did a half-hour show I'd have to work hard,
especially to maintain the integrity of it.''

   The daunting challenge of playing Shakespeare -
and Shaw, O'Neill, Chekhov and others of the classic theater - is
proving irresistible to big-name American actors willing to take
big risks in big stage roles.
   In the past year on and off Broadway and in regional theater,
such movie and television stars as Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Kline,
Stacy Keach, Brian Dennehy and William Hurt have tried roles as
challenging as Shylock in ``The Merchant of Venice,'' Hamlet,
Richard III, Hickey in Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh'' and
the title character in Chekhov's ``Ivanov.''
   Three other well-known actors - Hal Holbrook, Philip Bosco and
Jason Robards - are all tackling different productions of ``King
Lear'' this season. Holbrook currently stars as the raging monarch
at off-Broadway's Roundabout Theater, while the others plan to do
the role next spring, Bosco at the Folger in Washington and Robards
at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass.
   The pay is poor and the work is hard. Why do they do it?
   ``When an actor does the classics, he uses every muscle he has -
all of his imaginative, physical and emotional resources,'' says
Michael Kahn, artistic director of the Shakespeare Theater at the
Folger. ``It's like the Olympics.It's testing yourself against this
great material, and if you emerge triumphant, you feel pretty good
about yourself.''
   In England, the switch from commercial to classical roles
happens all the time, mostly because the television, movie and
stage production centers are concentrated around London. In the
United States, actors must shuttle between the East and West coasts
- and points in between - to work.
   A British star like Diana Rigg can chew the scenery in popular
escapist material like ``Mother Love,'' a pyschological thriller
shown here recently on public television's ``Mystery,'' and then
play Cleopatra in the 17th-century play ``All for Love'' by John
Dryden. The actress will star in the rarely seen Restoration
tragedy next April at the Almeida Theater, a small, 300-seat
theater in London.
   Glenda Jackson did Bertolt Brecht's ``Mother Courage'' last
summer and performers like Ian McKellen, John Wood, Joan Plowright
and others appear regularly on stage while fitting in work on
television or in the movies.
   One reason American actors do less classic theater is that they
have to plan their careers so far in advance. Hurt did ``Ivanov''
for only six weeks at the Yale Repertory Theater in New Haven,
Conn., but the commitment required juggling and rejuggling of the
actor's schedule.
   ``It is a luxury to be able to carve out the time from a busy
schedule of television or movies to do the classics, but for me, it
is absolutely essential,'' says Keach, whose Richard III at the
Folger was cheered by Washington critics and audiences. ``I started
in the classics. I've always had to try and plan as best as I can
to get back and do them.''
   Still, until he played the evil, humpbacked ``Richard III,''
Keach hadn't acted in a Shakespearean play for 15 years, although
he had starred in ``Hamlet'' three times - once at the Long Wharf
Theater in Connecticut, then in Central Park for the New York
Shakespeare Festival and finally at the Mark Taper Forum in Los
Angeles.
   Part of the excitement is the element of risk.
   ``You're making yourself extremely vulnerable because somebody
might tell you that you're lousy,'' Holbrook says. ``And it's not
like being lousy in an inconsequential part. You're standing up
there on the high board, taking a big swan dive.''
   Sometimes, those dives can bomb.
   Al Pacino, using a Brooklyn accent, limped through a disastrous
production of ``Richard III'' on Broadway 11 years ago. He wasn't
much better playing Mark Antony in ``Julius Caesar'' at the New
York Shakespeare Festival in 1988, an ill-conceived production that
also dragged down such other usually fine actors as Edward Herrmann
and Martin Sheen.

   When Charles Dickens wrote ``A Christmas Carol''
in 1843, he had no way of knowing that his simple truths would
provide creative fodder for filmmakers, animators, lyricists and
playwrights for generations to come.
   Many holiday-themed movies take their cue from Dickens'
wonderful story of Ebenezer Scrooge and his change of heart.
   Here is an alphabetical list of some, but certainly not all, of
some holiday-spiced videos for the Thanksgiving-Christmas-New Year
season. Many are versions of ``A Christmas Carol'':
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   - ``Alice's Restaurant'' (1969): It's the Thanksgiving Dinner
that couldn't be beat, and the generation that just said ``no'' to
the draft. From Arlo Guthrie's song.
   - ``Auntie Mame'' (1958): Christmas despair leads to Christmas
joy and a new marriage for Auntie Mame in this delightful romp.
   - ``Babes in Toyland'' (1961): A terrible Disney version (if
there is such a thing) of the Victor Herbert operetta, starring
Annette Funicello, Tommy Sands and Ray Bolger.
   - ``The Bear Who Slept Through Christmas'' (1983): Animated
story about a bear who skips hibernation to find out what Christmas
is all about. Not bad, but certainly not great.
   - ``Caspar's First Christmas'' (1987): Any parent who inflicts
this dud on a kid should be arrested for child abuse. Horrible
animation and terrible Caspar voice (it's not the one in the
original Caspar the Friendly Ghost cartoons) help make it
unbearable.
   - ``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' (1965): If you ever wondered
what CHristmas was all about, wonder no more. A magical treat from
the Peanuts characters.
   - ``A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving'' (1973): Linus explains the
true meaning of Thanksgiving. Another Peanuts gem.
   - ``A Child's Christmas in Wales'' (1987): Dylan Thomas'
wonderful story, somewhat lamely done.
   - ``A Christmas CArol'' (1938): A compassionate look at Scrooge,
starring Reginald Owen and GEne Lockhart.
   - ``A Christmas Carol'' (1951): The better version, with often
scary sequences. Stars Alastair Sim as a more broken and evil
Scrooge, whose transformation is all the more poignant.
   - ``Christmas in Connecticut'' (1945): A phony family for an
advice columnist. FAst-paced fun, starring Barbara Stanwyck and
Sydney Greenstreet.
   - ``Christmas Lilies of the Field'' (1984): Sequel to Academy
Award-winning movie that starred Sidney Poitier. This one is rather
Lame, but has its heart in the right place. Stars Billy Dee
Williams.
   - ``A Christmas Story'' (1983): Jean Shepard's marvelous memory
of Christmas in the 1940s and the ultimate gift, a regulation Red
Ryder air rifle.
   - ``A Disney Christmas Gift'' (1982): A real treat. The best of
Disney, with special holiday shorts.
   - ``Dr. Seuss: Horton Hears a Who''; ``The Grinch Who Stole
Christmas'' (1974): Made-for-television animated shorts from the
cartoon master himself, Chuck JOnes.
   - ``A Dream for Christmas'' (1973): A minister moves to
California to start a new church. A slice of American pie, but not
as tasty. Stars Hari Rhodes and BEah Richards.
   - ``Ernest Saves Christmas'' (1988): Ernest P. Worrell, that
down-home obnoxious TV pitchman, helps Santa. You have to be a true
Ernest fan for this one.
   - ``Happy New Year, Charlie Brown'' (1985): That old gang again.
And great as always.
   - ``Holiday Inn'' (1942): With music by Irving Berlin, and
memorable performances by Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby, who could
go wrong?
   - ``It's a Wonderful Life'' (1946): Frank Capra's black and
white marvel, starring JAmes Stewart as the man who made the wrong
wish and was saved from it.
   - ``March of the Wooden Soldiers'' (1934): Wonderful fantasy
feature starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, who save the land of
Old King Cole from the horrible boogeymen.
   - ``Meet Me in St. Louis'' (1944): Family entertainment from
Judy Garland, Margaret O'Brien and Tom Drake.
   - ``Mickey's Christmas Carol'' (1984): That resourceful little
rodent plays Bob CRatchit in this spin of the Dickens' classic.
   - ``Miracle on 34th Street'' (1947): Do you believe in Santa
Claus? A delightful tale, starring NAtalie Wood.
   - ``Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol'' (1962): The near-sighted one
plays Scrooge.
   - ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (and Other Wonderful
Christmas Stories)'' (1944): Four animated featurettes. All black
and white, and all classics.
   - ``Santa Claus - The Movie'' (1985): Dudley Moore plays an elf
in this enjoyable film. How fitting.
   - ``Night and Day'' (1946): CAry Grant portrays Cole Porter.
   - ``The Old Curiosity Shop'' (1975): A British-made version of
``Scrooge,'' the musical adaptation of ``A Christmas Carol.'' This
one is pretty good. Stars Anthony Newly and David Hemmings.
   - ``Scrooge'' (1970): Musical of Dickens tale. Stars Albert
Finney and Alec Guiness.
   - ``Scrooged'' (1988): One of the more disastrous versions of
the Dickens story. Saved by CArol Kane as the ghost of Christmas
Present. Stars Bill Murray doing his usual.
hilarious, as is the entire movie. Co-stars Eddie Murphy, Ralph
Bellamy, Don AMeche and Jamie Lee Curtis.
   - ``A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'' (1945): A sentimental portrait of
a working class family - in Brooklyn.
   - ``White Christmas'' (1954): AN inferior redo of ``Holiday
Inn,'' but it makes good use of the title song. Stars Bing Crosby
again.

   Donald Trump and investors in his Taj Mahal
casino agreed to a restructuring of the gambling parlor's debt that
will briefly put it under bankruptcy-court protection and give
bondholders half ownership of the glitzy Atlantic City property.
   Some details of the arrangement were still to be worked out, but
bondholder representatives said it contained several incentives for
Trump to improve the performance of the Taj Mahal, which has been
unable to break even since its April 2 opening. The deal was
reached Friday, more than 12 hours after Trump missed a $47.3
million interest payment on $675 million worth of high-yield junk
bonds used to finance the Taj Mahal.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The Manville trust fund will make staggered
payments to victims of asbestos diseases based on severity of
illness under a tentative settlement of tens of thousands of claims
nationwide, lawyers said.
   The agreement, announced Friday and expected to be completed
over the weekend, would mark a major breakthrough in a
two-decade-old effort to compensate workers made sick by inhaling
asbestos fibers in products made by U.S. companies. The deal would
have to be approved by U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who
earlier this year ordered the Manville trust overhauled. The trust
has 130,000 claims pending.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Consumer inflation slowed slightly in October
and the country's trade deficit narrowed, but economists attributed
these seemingly upbeat developments to the near certainty that the
nation has slid into a recession.
   Also on Friday, President Bush wrapped up a week of hastily
called meetings with his economic advisers and leading U.S.
business executives as the administration scoured for ways to
alleviate the pain from any economic downturn. Bush received a
generally bleak assessment of the economy's prospects from the
executives, leading the president to acknowledge the possibility of
a recession for the first time.

   NEWYORK (AP) - CBS' ``60 Minutes'' will fire three producers at
year's end, and ABC News will close its Frankfurt, Germany, bureau
and three Central American offices, network officials said.
   CBS will make the ``60 Minutes'' cuts to restructure the
top-rated series' staff, not because of economic conditions that
have forced what the network calls ``a belt-tightening'' in its
news division, a spokesman said Friday.
   The move was ordered after Harry Reasoner, one of the show's
first correspondents, announced he would reduce his workload, said
spokesman Roy Brunett.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Union employees of United Press International
have accepted a 35 percent, 90-day pay cut in what company and
union officials described as an effort to keep the financially
troubled news service going while its owners seek a buyer.
   Chris Dahl, secretary-treasurer of the Wire Service Guild, said
62 percent of those voting on Friday approved the reduction.Milt
Capps, a UPI vice president and spokesman, said the guild members
approved the pay cut ``in order to keep UPI alive while we seek a
buyer.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Phone company stocks took a pounding after MCI
Communications Corp. said its financial performance could falter
due to stepped-up competition from AT&amp;T, the economic slump, a
cost-cutting program and a recent acquisition.
   The decline on Friday was accelerated by a number of Wall Street
stock analysts, who lowered their earnings forecasts for the
nation's No. 2 long-distance phone company. MCI stock lost more
than a quarter of its value. Though the news appeared to favor
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., the stock price of the dominant
long-distance company also suffered.

   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Northwest Airlines Chairman Alfred
Checchi reportedly is exploring a buyout of Eastern Airlines using
up to $150 million in pension funds of Eastern's union pilots.
   The Saint Paul Pioneer Press said Friday that officials of the
Eastern Air Line Pilots Association have said union leaders are
agreeable to a Northwest acquisition. The officials also said their
leaders are willing to pitch the idea of lending Checchi the
pension funds, the paper reported.

   LONDON (AP) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd. is seeking a $600
million bridge loan to help alleviate a short-term liquidity
squeeze brought on by tough market conditions, bankers said.
   Murdoch and other senior News Corp. executives presented their
proposals to creditors earlier this week in Sydney and at a meeting
Thursday in London with British and European bankers.
Australian-based News Corp. is trying to line up support for a new
credit facility of $6.5 billion to replace much of its existing
debt, bankers said on Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - BEverly Enterprises Inc., the nation's largest
nursing home chain, has been found guilty of unfair labor practices
in a ruling organized labor called a major victory that could
affect other corporate giants.
   The Fort Smith, Ark.-based chain said the ruling, handed down by
an administrative law judge on Friday, would be appealed to the
National Labor Relations Board. At issue was a 1987 NLRB case in
which the government accused the company of engaging in 40 illegal
acts ``designed to defeat'' workers' rights to unionize.

   The stock market eked out a small gain Friday in an advance
restrained by selling pressure on long-distance telephone issues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.20 to 2,550.25,
stretching its gain for the week to 61.64 points.
   Bonds rose sharply amid clear-cut signs that the Federal Reserve
has moved to lower interest rates. The dollar declined broadly and
gold prices were mixed.
   Oil fell below $30 a barrel on the futures market.

   Profits in the nation's ailing securities
industry were an anemic $200 million in the first six months of
1990 and have deteriorated since then, Wall Street's leading trade
group said Sunday.
   The Securities Industry Association said Wall STreet is starting
toslash expenses beyond the nearly 50,000 job cuts since the 1987
stock market crash. The outlook remains gloomy.
   Trading and underwriting of stocks and bonds has been depressed
by drastically fewer mergers, concern over the economy, the
year-old collapse of the junk bond market and reduced activity by
individual investors.
   The SIA report said first-half 1990 profits ``barely reached
$200 million, a sum not equivalent to a single decent bond issue a
few years ago, and indications are third-quarter results will
deteriorate further.''
   The industry made $1.8 billion last year, $2.5 billion in 1988,
$1.1 billion in 1987 and a record of more than $5 billion in 1986.
Annual profits haven't been below $1 billion since the 1970s.
   The SIA said industry revenue will not increase this year for
the first time since the 1970s. It said profit margins are below 1
percent, return on equity is under 2 percent and brokerage
commissions are off 11 percent with no prospect for improvement by
the end of the year.
   George R. Monahan, the group's director of industry studies,
said with the exception of the top 10 firms, the industry ``has
been doing an excellent job of cost reduction.''
   Broker compensation is off about 6 percent from 1989, while
commission revenue is down about 7 percent. But at the 10 largest
firms, broker compensation is down 8 percent while commission
revenue has slumped 16 percent.
   Wall Street is notorious for its high compensation levels,
particularly during boom cycles such as the mid-1980s when young
investment bankers and other professionals quickly commanded
six-figure salaries. Stockbrokers, on the other hand, tend to
receive less pay.
   The SIA said that when expenses are adjusted to exclude gross
interest expenses, compensation in the first six months of 1990
accounted for 57 percent of total costs. Overall, pay was down to a
third of all expenses from 41 percent in 1987, the group said.
   Further compensation cuts are occurring. Year-end bonuses this
year for highly paid investment bankers - an important indicator of
compensation trends -are expected to be slashed 30 percent to 50
percent at top firms.
   That would bring compensation for investment bankers down to
1985 levels, Wall Street executives say, still considered high.
Many firms in recent weeks have laid off investment bankers,
including senior-level professionals, because of declining
business.
   Despite several rounds of cutting since the 1987 crash, Wall
Street pay last year still averaged more than $82,700 per employee,
including clerks and secretaries, the SIA reported, almost double
the level a decade ago.
   Nearly 50,000 jobs have been eliminated from the securities
industry's peak employment of more than 260,000 nationwide in 1987.
   Apart from compensation, other cost-cutting appears to be more
successful, the SIA said, as expenses in all other areas are below
1989 levels. But Monahan said even that may not be enough.
   ``Although long-standing practices are now being changed, some
firms still make payments to both profitable and unprofitable
departments on the premise that business cycles will even this out
in the end, which may not happen,'' he said.
   Separately, the SIA announced that Thomas A. James, president
and chief executive of Raymond James &amp; Associates Inc., a St.
Petersburg, Fla., brokerage, was nominated as chairman-elect. He is
to serve as an SIA officer and director in 1991 and become chairman
in 1992.
   The SIA represents about 600 brokerage and investment banking
firms in the United States and Canada that account for about 90
percent of securities activity in North America.

<HEAD>Few Guarantees in Czechoslovakia's New Capitalism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a child, Josef Dundr would
stroll with his father past the snug Three Ostriches Inn, a
buff-colored 17th-century building that had belonged to the family
until the communists came.
   ``My father would say, `This used to be ours; maybe it will be
again some day','' said Dundr, who was born there 44 years ago. ``I
didn't see that day coming, I was so downtrodden by that time.''
   The communists no longer run Czechoslovakia and the day may come
after all.
   On Dec. 1, the government will start selling or giving back to
private owners 100,000 restaurants, small shops and other
businesses. The return of many factories and other large
enterprises will begin next year.
   In the new, no-frills capitalism of Czechoslovkia, however,
individuals may lose out to economic expedience. They risk losing
their jobs, as well as the chance of ownership, but the winners can
get rich.
   Officials cite the Soviet Union's many false starts in their
argument against moving slowly. All East European countries have
lost time since their communist regimes fell last year, but
Czechoslovakia now may be poised to outpace the others.
   For people with money, the switch to private enterprise ``is a
golden opportunity not to be repeated in this century,'' said
Miroslav Zamecnik, spokesman for Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus.
   There are few guarantees in the new system.
   Dundr may not get the Three Ostriches back. Alena Kubistova is
not sure she will have a job when a private owner takes over the
meat market she manages just off Wenceslas Square.
   Down the street, Ctirad Fuchs, 30, looks for a compromise
between his wish to own the music and book store he manages and the
interests of the building's new owner.
   President Vaclav Havel has warned that failure to protect such
people as Fuchs and the others could lead to unrest, but appears to
have yielded to Klaus's desire for quick reform.
   When Parliament approved the privatization law Oct. 25, the
finance minister acknowledged it would not ``satisfy all
completely.''
   Dundr, now assistant manager of the joint-venture Palace Hotel,
considers the Three Ostriches a sure moneymaker. It nestles at the
foot of the Charles Bridge on the royal route to Prague Castle, and
enjoyed a good reputation even under state ownership.
   He estimated its worth at 25 million to 70 million crowns, or
from $1 million to nearly $3 million.
   Emotion is deeply involved in the desire to get the inn back.
Dundr said his father, now 81, ``wants to feel that he can pass
this on to his children and grandchildren.''
   His likely rival for the Three Ostriches is the man who runs the
restaurant and the 18-room hotel the state made from the family
apartments above it. Dundr fears the manager's connections in the
bureaucracy give him an edge.
   ``In a case like this, millions are involved,'' he said.
``Stamps can be issued, documents can be signed.''
   If he gets the inn back, Dundr said, he will fire the manager
and staff of about 20 for inefficiency and rudeness.
   Zamecnik, the Finance Ministry spokesman, sees nothing wrong
with such action. ``The sooner they kick these people out, the
better,'' he said.
   Under the privatization law, property must be returned to former
Owners or their heirs, or be auctioned. LOcal governments will set
bid prices, and any small business can be bought for a minimum of
half the asking price.
   Even before the law was approved, managers of state-run stores
held brief strikes to express concern that Czechoslovaks who got
rich on the black market or through past Communist Party
connections would have an advantage.
   According to Zamecnik, the government will not examine buyers
too closely because a quick change to private enterprise offers a
way to put ill-gotten wealth back into legal circulation.
   Dundr's position is that the Three Ostriches should be returned
to the family rather than auctioned. It falls into a gray area,
however.
   The family acquired the restaurant in about 1930 and was
nationalized after communists took power in 1948. The Dundrs kept
the building until 1962, then turned it over as a cultural monument
they could not afford to preserve.
   To protect consumers, the law requires that any shop going
private must continue selling the same goods for one year, but
privatization is much farther along than efforts to cushion its
effects.
   There are no requirements for private owners to retain current
employees or even to pay a minimum wage.
   Ms. Kubistova, like most working Czechoslovaks, has no
experience of market economics. She was 3 years old when the
communists took over.
   After her first talk with the new owner of the meat market, she
said, she is about 80 percent sure he will keep her on as manager,
at least for now.
   Her current salary of about $110 a month is above the national
average, but she said more important than pay is ``whether you will
have a job.''
   Fuchs would like to reach an agreement to own his music and book
store, and perhaps others of the approximately 100 in Prague.
   The store manager said he should have the chance not by right,
but because Prague needs such stores managed by competent people.
   ``Culture as a commodity will not be very attractive when the
price of paper and food go up,'' he said wryly.

<HEAD>Despite Cigarette Machine Ban, Teens Still Puff Away</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Advocates of Utah's pioneering statewide
ban on cigarette vending machines claim a victory in their war on
tobacco, citing statistics that show a modest decline in teen-age
smoking.
   But in downtown Salt Lake City, youths defiantly puff away and
mock the ban.
   ``I buy them at the store. They never ask'' how old you are,
said Dean, who at 17 is two years under Utah's legal smoking and
drinking age. ``If you're going to smoke, you're going to smoke.''
   Penni, 16, gets cigarettes from friends or her parents.
   ``If you can't get them that way, you just rip them off or walk
in and buy them. Nobody cares,'' she said, making her point with a
long drag.
   For 11-year-old Racheska, it's only slightly more difficult.
Sometimes, she says, her mother buys them for her. Other times, she
buys them in convenience stores.
   The image of Racheska is a haunting one for Chris Chalkley, a
chief advocate of the state's 15-month-old prohibition on cigarette
vending machines in public places, the first such statewide ban in
the nation.
   ``Everyone has their source, I know. It's sad. That's our
challenge now, tighter controls. ... The vending machines were the
first step,'' said Chalkley, manager of the Utah Department of
Health's tobacco prevention and control program.
   She insists the ban has, coupled with anti-smoking education,
had some effect - enough to spark similar efforts elsewhere.
Minneapolis has banned cigarette machines, and the New York City
Council this month voted to ban them in most public places.
Pittsburgh has approved a requirement that cigarette machines
accept only tokens, whose sale would be controlled, but it hasn't
gone into effect yet.
   Chalkley cites student surveys showing that from 1987 to 1989 -
the first year the ban took effect - smoking in the 12-to-17 age
group declined from 13.1 percent to 10.5 percent in Utah.
   A 1988 National Institutes of Health study estimated that on
average, 11.8 percent of America's adolescents smoke.
   Chalkley says that when legislators meet in January, their
agenda will include further proposals to shut off the tobacco
pipeline to Utah's youth - including requiring stores selling
cigarettes to post signs reading: ``We I.D. for tobacco sales.''
   Other possibilities include requiring that tobacco products be
placed behind sales counters, and providing stiffer penalties for
stores that sell to minors, including revoking sales licenses.
   Little opposition to the measures is expected in this state,
where seven out of 10 people are Mormons taught to abstain from
tobacco, alcohol, coffee and tea.
   Currently, selling tobacco to a minor is a misdemeanor carrying
a maximum $500 fine and 90-day jail term on the first offense;
$1,000 fine and six months behind bars on the second; and $2,500
fine and a year in jail for a third offense.
   ``Really, we need to put the screws on the convenience store
operators or anyone else who sells cigarettes to people under 19.
We want to go after them,'' said Republican state Rep. Hugh Rush,
who sponsored the ban.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlantic City's gambling industry
wants the state to loosen regulations, introduce sports gambling
and allow other changes that casino operators hope will help them
last through the weak economy.
   The most visible example of the downturn in Atlantic City's
gambling fortunes has been Donald Trump's Taj Mahal casino. In a
deal reached with bondholders this past week, Trump gave the
investors half ownership in exchange for allowing him to delay a
$47.3 million interest payment. Also, the interest rate on the
bonds was cut 2 percentage points to 12 percent.
   The casinos want round-the-clock gambling, instead of the
current 18-hour limit on weekdays and 20 hours on weekends. They
also want to be able to take wagers on sports and open more than 30
percent of their casino floors to slot machines.
   Casinos have also asked for relief from state regulations they
consider onerous and costly in both time and money, and the ability
to easily introduce variations of existing games.
   ``We have to get away from the idea that whenever a casino
proposes something new, it's something bad,'' said John Sweeney,
the new director of the state Division of Gaming Enforcement. ``We
can't be looking at everything they do in a suspicious manner.''
   The prospects for 24-hour gambling are less certain than those
for regulatory relief, but industry executives are clamoring for it
anyway. The likelihood for sports gambling also is uncertain.
   A bill that would allow sports betting in the casinos has been
proposed by state Sen. Louis Bassano. Casinos do not anticipate
benefiting much from the action, but think it would bring new
business to the city.
   Sen. William Gormley, a Republican senator who represents
Atlantic County, home of the gambling resort, doubts that New
Jersey is ready to emulate Nevada and adopt legal sports betting.
   ``Given the current tenor after Pete Rose when people hear about
betting and athletes and athletic competition, it still gives them
a certain hesitancy,'' Gormley said. ``Right now, it's something I
don't have a high comfort level with.''
   A measure to open up more of the casino floor to slot machines
appears to have the best shot of clearing the Legislature.
   Assemblyman Fred Scerni has proposed raising the current
percentage of floor space casinos are allowed to devote to slot
machines from 30 percent to 40 percent.
   The 30 percent limit is a holdover from the beginnings of
gambling here when the founding fathers envisioned a traditional
betting parlor emphasizing blackjack and craps.
   But the slots have become increasingly popular among patrons,
and now account for 60 cents of each $1 gambled at the resort's
dozen casinos.
   ``It's something we'd really like to see,'' said John Belisle,
vice president of marketing for Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino
Hotel. ``The slots just continue to grow.''

   Floor traders, protesting government
inaction on long-awaited regulatory reforms, halted stock trading
in Italy on Monday for a second consecutive session.
   The strike, by about 1,000 floor traders, began on Friday and
was scheduled to last through Wednesday.
   Picket lines outside the two largest Italian markets in Milan
and Rome prevented trading in equity and bonds.
   Only foreign exchange quotations by bank officials were
completed.
   The traders are protesting 30 percent capital gains tax proposed
by the finance minister. They have also long complaining that the
failure of the government to implement reforms hurts Italian
markets' competiveness. They specifically want to see swift
implementation of a legislation regulating public tender offers,
insider trading and financial intermediaries.
   ``We don't want to see that Italian markets are bypassed and
that investors increasingly resort to London and other European
markets,'' said a Milan floor trader, who spoke under condition of
anonimity.
   Several Italian blue chip companies are traded in London and
quoted closing prices despite the markets strike in Italy.

<HEAD>Union Accepts Three-Year Deal with General Dynamics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the largest union at General
Dynamics Inc.'s jet-building plant say the new three-year contract
that was approved Sunday was the best they could get considering
the soft economy and the downturn in the defense industry.
   ``We felt it was the best we could do without a long dispute,''
said Pat Lane, president of the 10,000-member International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers' Lodge 776. ``I
know a lot of people would have had to suffer to (greatly) improve
the contract.''
   ``We are still short on insurance and the bonuses ... but I feel
it is the best contract we could get at this time,'' Lane said.
   Sunday's vote came a week after the union, which represents
about one-third of the plant's workers, narrowly rejected a
contract proposal nearly identical to the one that was approved.
   The vote was 5,835-1,013 in favor of the new agreement, said
General Dynamics spokesman Mike Hatfield. The contract took effect
at 12:01 a.m. today.
   The union, after narrowly defeating a proposed contract Nov. 11,
agreed to extend the deadline to midnight Sunday rather than
strike. Negotiations resumed Thursday, with both sides refusing
public comment until Sunday's vote.
   Hatfield said the contract's terms include a 5.5 percent general
wage increase the first year and 3 percent increases each of the
next two years.
   Hatfield said General Dynamics also will pay a $1,100
ratification bonus to each union member and cost of living
adjustments projected to equal about $1.66 an hour by the end of
the three years.
   ``We set out some weeks ago when negotiations began with the
intent to strike an agreement that would be equitable for both
sides and I think we achieved that,'' Hatfield said.
   The agreement could be considered a setback for the union, which
had originally sought a wage increase of 10 percent in the first
year of the contract and 5 percent in each of the following two
years.
   But union leaders say the deal is the best they could negotiate,
given the soft economy and coming downturn in the nation's defense
industry.
   ``In this day and age it's a pretty good contract,'' said union
attorney Rod Tanner. ``Many members were hoping to obtain
ratification bonuses in the second and third year, but there just
wasn't the money. If it had the bonuses, it would have been an
excellent contract.''
   ``The negotiation committee worked very hard to try to obtain a
better proposal,'' Tanner said. ``Although there were some aspects
that were disappointing, it was in the best interest of the union
to accept the contract.
   Workers also told The Dallas Morning News that a temporary
restraining order obtained by the company against pickets in the
event of a strike may have intimidated workers.
   Despite the vote on the new contract, union members seem
uniformly pessimistic about the plant's future. From a peak
employment of about 31,000, the work force could fall to 25,000 by
1995, Fort Worth Division general manager Charles Anderson said
last week.
   General Dynamics has given notice to about 150 hourly workers
that they will be out of a job by Dec. 14 and has said it will lay
off 700 to 1,000 salaried employees in the research and engineering
department in January.

<TEXT>
   Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.'s struggle to
stay afloat was complicated Monday when investors in its JN Taylor
Holdings Ltd. unit sought to have a provisional liquidator
appointed for JN Taylor.
   The application was made in the Supreme Court in South Australia
state by 28 investors holding about 21 percent of JN Taylor
preference shares.
   The move throws doubt on Bond Corp.'s proposed debt-for-equity
swap with its creditors which would put 90 percent of the company's
stock in the hands of European bond holders.
   JN Taylor's assets are a $139 million loan to another Bond Corp.
subsidiary, Bond Corp. Finance, and a $74.5 million loan to Alan
Bond's family company, Dallhold Investments Pty. Ltd.
   On Friday, Bond Corp. released a letter written by Bond Corp.
executive chairman Peter Lucas to JN Taylor, in which he said
neither Bond Corp. nor Bond Corp. Finance was in a position to
repay all or part of the debt.
   An application to liquidate Bond Corp. could be an avenue that a
liquidator to JN Taylor would pursue if Bond Corp. did not repay
its debt.
   However, Bond Corp. executive Peter Lucas played down this
threat Monday and said if a liquidator were appointed to JN Taylor,
he may well choose to take part in the debt-for-equity plan.
   He also said a liquidator would not necessarily threaten Bond
Corp.'s restructuring.
   However, in the letter released Friday, Lucas said Dallhold had
advised Bond Corp. that if it were required to repay loans from JN
Taylor, support for the plan could not be provided.
   The orders being sought by the preference shareholders also ask
for an auditor to investigate inter-company advances and agreements
among JN Taylor, Bond Corp. and Bond Corp. Finance.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly
higher this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, but then
weakened in early dealings.
   ``This was based on talk of a hugh Soviet deal with the U.S.,''
said William Biedermann, research director of Allendale Inc. in
Crystal Lake, Ill.
   ``But this is strictly talk so far. That's why prices weakened
after the opening,'' he said.
   The opening surge was follow-through buying from last week's
strong close when the market sensed something was up because of
active commercial buying.
   But Biedermann said the market is uneasy about taking prices too
high until some stronger proof surfaces giving substance to the
U.S.-Soviet rumors.
   ``The market's saying, `I hear you, but I want to see it,''' he
said.
   Biedermann said if the commercials are big buyers again this
week, it will be a pretty good indication that there is a deal.

<HEAD>Expects to Post Loss for Fourth Qtr</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. said today it expects to report a loss
for the fourth quarter and lower earnings from continuing
operations for all of 1991 compared with this year.
   The media giant said its anticipated loss for the fourth quarter
was due to unexpectedly large losses at the CBS Television Network
due to broadcasts of major league baseball and a slowdown in the
growth of national advertising.
   The last quarterly loss excluding onetime events at CBS was in
the fourth quarter of 1986 when the company lost $20 million on
continuing operations.
   CBS earned $59.5 million, or $2.31 a share, in the fourth
quarter of 1989.
   It said earnings from continuing operations are expected to be
lower in 1991 than in 1990 because of the worsening economic
climate for advertising and rising costs for entertainment programs
and sports rights.
   The disclosures came as CBS senior exectives planned to meet
today with the CBS affiliates board. The board represents the
network's 200-some television stations affiliated with the CBS TV
network.
   It was reported last week that CBS may propose a cut in what it
pays affiliates to carry the network's programs. CBS has refused to
comment.
   This was the first year of CBS's four-year baseball contract
which allows it to carry several regular season games along with
the league championship series, World Series and All-Star game.
   While the network reportedly expected to lose about $35 million
in the first year of the $1.06 billion contract, the losses are
said to have run migh higher. CBS Sports President Neal Pilson has
said only that the loss on baseball was under $100 million.
   In today's announcement, CBS said losses on baseball were
``higher than anticipated'' as the result of soft demand in the ad
marketplace for time on sports programs and because the World
Series and one of the two league championships were settled in four
games instead of the maximum seven.
   The short series meant CBS had fewer nights of baseball on which
to sell advertising. Games later in a series also tend to draw
bigger audiences, making them more valuable to advertisers.
   CBS said its TV network would have had a loss for the fourth
quarter even without baseball, however, because of the soft ad
marketplace.
   It said the marketplace weakness has dampened demand for
Network, local TV and radio advertising, and said network ad prices
have been particulartly soft for National Football League and
primetime broadcasts.
   Another reason for the anticipated decline in earnings from
continuing operations next year is that the 1990 figures include
profits on the coverage of the NFL Super Bowl and the National
Basketball Association playoffs and championship that the network
will not have rights to in 1991.
   ``As a result, the CBS Television Network is currently expected
to show an operating loss in 1991,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Report: Venezuela Plans Vast Increase in Oil Output</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state oil monopoly plans to
increase its capacity for oil production, from the current 2
million barrels daily to 4.2 million barrels daily by 1996, a
newspaper reported Monday.
   Petroleos de Venezuela's ambitious expansion plans would cost
about $20 billion, according to the daily El Diario de Caracas,
which quoted oil sources it did not identify.
   The newspaper said that while Venezuela's production capacity
would rise to 4.2 million barrels a day, the country would have a
production target of just 3.7 million barrels a day. The oil
monopoly had previously been planning to raise production to 3.5
million barrels a day by 1995.
   Venezuela believes its increased capacity would be useful in
dealing with international emergencies, such as the current Persian
Gulf standoff that initially cut off some 4 million barrels per day
and drove up oil prices, the newspaper reported. Increased
production from various nations, particularly Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela, have virtually erased that shortfall.
   The Saudis have also recently considered vast expansion of their
production capacity, in what analysts view as a move to develop
enough capacity to avoid future run-ups in oil prices.
   Venezuela's expansion plans depend heavily on attracting foreign
investment in oil, which is largely prohibited by the laws that
nationalized oil in 1976. Carrying out the plans would probably
require congress to approve changes in the law.

   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
United States dropped for a second week, with a reported loss of 21
rigs since last week to 1,103, Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   The decrease followed a drop of 20 rigs last week, but remained
above the count a year ago when there were 1,040 rigs operating
nationally. Two weeks ago, the number of working rigs reached 1,144
- a high not seen since Dec. 28, 1987.
   Of the total rigs running as of Monday, 109 were offshore, 26
were in inland waters and 989 were on land, the toolmaker reported.
   Baker Hughes has kept track of the rig count - the widely
watched index of drilling activity - since 1940. The count
represents the number of rigs actively exploring for oil, not those
producing oil.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Wyoming and Louisiana led the list major oil producing states
reporting rig losses for the week, with drops of 10 and eight rigs,
respectively. Other losses were reported in Colorado, down by four;
and Michigan, New Mexico and Oklahoma, each down by three.
   North Dakota led the major oil producing states with gains for
the week, reporting an increase of five rigs. Other states
reporting increases include Kansas, up by four; Texas, which rose
by two; and Ohio and Pennsylvania, each of which picked up a single
rig for the week.
   California was unchanged for the week.

<HEAD>UAW Ratifies Chrysler Pact, Last of Big Three</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union has ratified a new
three-year contract with CHrysler Corp., tying up the last of three
agreements with the nation's Big Three automakers.
   Union members at Chrysler plants ratified the new agreement by a
margin of better than 4-to-1, the UAW said Monday. Contracts with
General Motors Corp. and Ford MOtor Co. were ratified by slightly
smaller margins.
   A date for signing the new UAW-Chrysler contract hasn't been
set.
   IN all, more than 450,000 active workers at Big Three factories,
warehouses and offices in the United States are covered by the
contracts, which provide manufacturing flexibility for automakers
and wage security for their workers. The contracts expire at
midnight, Sept. 14, 1993.
   Each one provides for a 3 percent base wage increase in the
first year and 3 percent lump-sum payments in the second and third
years, and increases for current and future retirees. The contracts
also provide for income guarantees for workers laid off from
factories shut down because of slumping sales for more than 36
weeks during the next three years.
   As in all negotiations, both sides scored some wins and some
losses.
   For the union, perhaps the biggest win was bargaining nearly the
same agreement with each of the automakers. A pattern contract
seemed probable for GM and Ford, but questionable for Chrysler
because of its weaker financial position.
   However, less than three hours after UAW President Owen Bieber
met Oct. 30 with Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, the union and the
company announced a tentative agreement fitting the GM-Ford
pattern.
   The automakers failed to gain any immediate reduction in
health-care costs. The UAW and the Big Three did agree in side
letters to each agreement to work on cutting health-care costs,
including exploration of a national health care system.
   The companies, faced with continued competition from Japanese
automakers and an overcapacity problem in their U.S. factories, did
retain the ability to ``idle,'' or effectively close, unprofitable
factories. BUt it could come at a price.
   Each of the automakers agreed to set aside money - as much as
$4.1 billion by GM - to bring unemployment benefits for workers
displaced at idled factories to 100 percent of their pre-shutdown
levels.

   Most grain and soybean futures prices advanced
Monday on rumors that the Soviet Union may be interested in buying
huge quantities of U.S. commodities.
   While the price trend reinforced Friday's strong close, traders

   Tens of thousands of workers made sick by
asbestos will receive sharply reduced compensation payments from
the Manville trust under a plan unveiled Monday to resolve the
nation's biggest product liability case.
   The long-awaited restructuring is designed to insure payments to
victims of lung cancer and other respiratory ailments, clear a
court backlog and create a model for companies facing huge
liabilities for asbestos products.
   The plan includes up to $520 million in new contributions to the
trust by Manville Corp., which was driven into bankruptcy court in
1982 by mounting asbestos lawsuits. The trust was formed in the
company's 1988 reorganization and faces more than 130,000 claims.
   ``These steps ... will more effectively, efficiently and
Equitably compensate those injured by asbestos exposure,'' Manville
chairman and chief executive Tom Stephens said in a statement.
   The plan was expected to be approved by U.S. District Judge Jack
B. Weinstein, who is leading efforts to resolve asbestos
litigation. The judge Monday began a process to declare a class
action to settle trust claims.
   A restructured trust would pay asbestos victims according to the
severity of illness, rather than when a claim is filed. The plan
slashes plaintiffs lawyers' fees to a maximum 25 percent of
settlements.
   It also includes dismissing tens of thousands of lawsuits
against the trust pending in state and federal courts nationwide.
Asbestos health claims form the biggest product liability issue in
U.S. history.
   Manville trust payments have averaged about $43,000, but are
forecast to fall more than half for serious diseases and even more
for less severe ailments. Claimants are to receive a maximum 45
percent of settlements until all claims are partially met.
   ``It is a terrible compromise,'' said Heather Maurer, executive
director of the Asbestos Victims of America, an advocacy group
representing 18,000 people. ``I$3,000 or $4,000 is in any way just compensation
for their diseases
and deaths.''
   But architects of the plan said it was  fair way to compensate
victims given the limited funds available. The restructuring was
ordered by Weinstein after the trust ran out of cash to pay new
claims and said some would be deferred until long into the 21st
century.
   ``Everybody is getting an (equal) share of the fair value of
their claim,'' said GEne Locks, a Philadelphia plaintiffs lawyer.
``Some people are going to get it a little faster than others.''
   Asbestos is a white mineral with natural insulation and heat
resistance used widely for decades in shipbuilding, construction
and other industries. A high incidence of lung cancer and other
respiratory ailments attributed to asbestos began appearing in the
1970s.
   Under the Manville plan, payments would be made annually to
claimants based on a percentage of the trust's available resources.
Claims are split into two groups: cancer and other serious
ailments, and lesser diseases.
   Payments would be made only to claims in the first group during
the plan's first two years. An estimated 23,000 such claims are
expected to get some money. The group includes relatives of workers
who died before being compensated.
   The more than 100,000 claims in the second group would begin
receiving payment in the plan's third year. Payments are to be made
first to those with hardships, then according to disease severity,
then to claimants over 70 years old and finally to those who filed
first.
   Despite the progress, payments will not resume until Weinstein
holds hearings and reviews the plan, or until expected court
appeals by plaintiffs lawyers and other defendant companies are
Heard. Lawyers estimate that payments might not resume for a year
or more.
   The trust, formed in 1988, has paid out more than $1.1 billion
to settle nearly 26,000 claims. A total of 163,000 claims have been
filed and more arrive daily. The trust has $434 million in settled
but unpaid claims, which will be met in full under the plan.
   Trust officials have blamed the cash crunch on more claims and
bigger settlements than anticipated and faster case resolution.
Critics have said the trust was badly managed, doling out too-large
payments for minor ailments.
   The reduction in plaintiffs lawyers' fees from about one-third
of settlements followed sharp criticism by Weinstein.
   ``The 25 percent limitation will over time provide the victims
hundreds of millions of dollars that otherwise would have gone to
their attorneys,'' Leon Silverman, the court-appointed adviser for
the restructuring, said in his report to Weinstein.
   Dismissing lawsuits against the trust - primarily over the size
of or delay in settlements - also should lead to savings. The trust
expects more than $50 million in legal defense expenses this year.
   The plan establishes maximum settlements for specific diseases.
They range from $350,000 for mesolthelioma, a fatal respiratory
ailment, to $30,000 for pleural disease. Expected median
settlements are about 40 percent of the maximum.
   Payments to all Manville claimants except those with urgent
health or financial needs were suspended in July.
   The Washingon, D.C.-based trust originally was funded with about
$3 billion in cash and Manville securities. Its main asset is 80
percent stock ownership of Manville, a Denver manufacturing and
natural resources company.

<HEAD>EC, US Officials Have Impromptu Meet on Farm GATT Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top U.S. and EC officials held a
hastily scheduled meeting Monday to try to narrow their differences
on farm subsidies and rescue world trade talks from collapse.
Ray MacSharry, the European Community Agriculture Commissioner,
were scheduled over the weekend to discuss technical details of
their respective farm proposals for the Dec. 3-7 conclusion to the
Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations.
   NO details of the talks were made available.
   The talks offered a glimmer of hope that progress could be made
after a week of high-level talks that left both sides sticking to
their positions, putting the successful conclusion of the trade
talks in doubt.
   An EC official, who asked not to be named, said it was the first
time the two sides discussed the U.S. and EC proposals in great
detail.
   ``They have gone away from rhetoric and are looking at the
details of the EC proposal,'' the EC official said of U.S.
negotiators. ``That is an important development.''
   Meanwhile in Geneva, the head of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade said he believed a ``substantial package'' of
agreements was still possible at the Dec. 3-7 session. GATT is
sponsoring the trade talks.
   Arthur Dunkel told a press conference that although talks were
still deadlocked on farm subsidies, progress had been made in other
important areas such as efforts to reduce restrictions on trade in
textiles.
   The sticking point in agriculture is the amount of cuts in
subsidies and export subsidies. The EC has offered a 30 percent
subsidy cut in the 1986-1996 period, while the United STates wants
a 75 percent reduction in the 1990s plus a 90 percent cut in export
subsidies.
   YEutter gave the Uruguay Round talks a less than 50-50 chance of
success on Friday after he and senior U.S. officials held talks at
the EC head office.
   But MacSharry has insisted the two proposals are ``broadly
similar'' when only the overlapping time frame is considered. On
Monday, the EC source said such technical issues were at the heart
of Monday's meeting.
   The trade talks cover more than a dozen other negotiating areas
ranging from textiles to services and intellectual properties.
   In Geneva, Dunkel said negotiators had agreed on a single
framework text on trade in textiles. A trade source said the text
provides for the phasing out of existing restrictions in textile
trade, but added there was no consensus on how fast the barriers
should be eliminated.
   Dunkel also said there were still wide rifts over rules to
prevent goods from being ``dumped'' on world markets at
artificially low prices.

<TEXT>
   Kmart Corp. said Monday its third-quarter
Income rose 1.7 percent as strong sales of basic merchandise
overcame soft demand for big-ticket items.
   The discount retailer said it earned $105.9 million, or 53 cents
a share, for the 13 weeks ended Oct. 31, up from $104.1 million, or
52 cents a share in its fiscal third quarter of 1989.
   Sales for the period rose 11.7 percent to $7.49 billion from
$6.71 billion a year earlier, said Kmart, the country's
second-largest retailer after Sears, Roebuck and Co.
   Joseph E. Antonini, Kmart's chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a statement the firm's basic merchandise sales
were strong enough to offset weakness in more expensive lines such
as electronics.
   Kmart's third-quarter earnings were in line with forecasts, and
the discount chain has been trimming inventories to prepare for
what retailers expect to be a lean Christmas season, said analyst
Stacy Dutton of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   For the first three fiscal quarters, Kmart said its net income
was up 3.1 percent to $354 million, or $1.77 a share, on sales of
$22.32 billion, from $343.2 million, or $1.71 a share, on sales of
$19.78 billion in the same period of 1989.
   The company operates 2,336 Kmart discount stores in the United
States, Puerto Rico and Canada, and is the parent company for Pay
Less Drug Stores, Builders Square, Waldenbooks, PACE Membership
Warehouse Clubs and The Sports Authority.

   Chevron USA COrp. on Monday reached a partial
settlement with Gulf pensioners in a class-action suit, agreeing to
pay benefits and claims of about $25 million to terminated
employees.
   The San FRancisco-based petroleum company agreed to vest the
pension benefits of all employees fired by Gulf between Jan. 1,
1984 and June 30, 1986. Chevron acquired Gulf in 1984.
   Chevron has agreed to pay claims for severance, early retirement
benefits and post-retirement medical and life insurance made by
various employees working at operations sold by Chevron.
   In addition, Chevron agreed to pay 25 percent of the litigants'
attorneys' fees.
   ``We are pleased that Chevron has agreed to pay these claims,''
said Lee Godfrey, lead counsel for the plaintiffs. ``Many class
members who will be vested by this agreement have no other vested
pension rights.''
   Robert J. MALinak, a Houston attorney representing Chevron in
the proceedings, termed the settlement ``a reasonable resolution of
the claims.'' The settlement was announced as a month-long trial
resumed Monday in federal court in Houston in which the plaintiffs
want nearly $600 million restored to the Gulf pensioners plan.
   The plaintiffs claim surplus money in the Gulf pension plan
should not have been lumped into a merged fund with money from the
Chevron pension plan when Chevron merged the two pension plans in
1986.
   The suit was filed on behalf of more than 40,000 former Gulf Oil
Corp. employees, retirees and CHevron employees who previously
Worked for Gulf and their family members.

   Oil prices rallied sharply Monday on news that
Iraq will send another 250,000 troops into Kuwait.
   Light sweet crude oil, the benchmark blend, had dropped about $1
a barrel in early trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
traders focused on prospects of peace in the gulf.
   But prices shot up after Iraqi President Saddam HUssein
announced the military buildup. Crude settled at $31.50 per barrel
for December delivery contracts, up $1.72.
   Analysts said part of the run-up occurred as traders who had
sold oil on the speculattion prices would drop scrambled to buy it
back when prices began strengthening, a phenomenon known as
short-covering. But the overall movement of oil prices was based on
the Iraqi mobilization of additional troops.
   Contracts for delivery in January were up $1.13 at $30.72, and
other months were mostly higher.
   ``Obviously, the market's spooked a little bit by Saddam's
comments,'' said Randall Rothenberg, a broker with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   ``The traders seem to be tied on to the last statement from
Iraq, the next statements from Washington and so forth,'' said Bob
Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``No real
fundamental change, but there's a lot of emotions.''
   As oil rose, so did contracts for refined petroleum products and
natural gas.
   Wholesale home heating oil went up 2.34 cents to 86.76 cents a
gallon on December delivery contracts, with later delivery months
all moving higher.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline was up 2.73 cents at 80.36 cents a
gallon for December delivery, with later months all moving up.
   Natural gas contracts were all higher, with December delivery up
1.5 cents at $2.35 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Oil had opened $1.18 lower as it stayed briefly beneath $30 a
barrel for next-month delivery. Crude had moved that low Friday,
for the first time since Oct. 23, but it didn't take long MOnday
for traders to push oil back above the $30 mark.
   Crude made an immediate reversal on the news of the Iraqi
troops. The mood of the market stayed bullish for the rest of the
session, even though many traders doubt hostilities will break out
in the Gulf before President Bush winds up his Thanksgiving visit
to the U.S. troops in the Saudi desert.

   Sassy, an often controversial magazine for
teen-age girls, let the readers do it in the December issue.
   Sassy's editors put out the call last summer for readers who
would create their own issue and selected 81 people from among more
than 10,000 applicants. The issue goes on sale Tuesday.
   ``Every single little thing in this issue is totally
reader-produced,'' the magazine boasts on the latest cover, which
carries a photo of three readers.
   Led by designated editor Summer Lopez, a 17-year-old high school
student from Los Gatos, Calif., about 40 readers visited Sassy's
office in a building overlooking Times Square this past August to
select story ideas, write and edit features and columns, shoot
photos, lay out pages and devise catchy headlines.
   The others selected for the assignment did their jobs from home.
   ``I learned talking and writing like a teen-ager can be hard,
even if I am one myself,'' wrote Ms. Lopez in a signed column that
leads the issue.
   Cover stories included ``Eight teens who fought for their
rights,'' ``Living with cokehead parents'' and ``Why we don't like
our bodies.''
   ``I'm real happy with it,'' said the Sassy's editor in chief for
the 11 other issues a year, Jane Pratt. ``They wrote a little older
than we do, a little straighter ... But the design is younger in
some ways.''
   Sassy was launched in March 1988 and has occasionally generated
controversyhomosexuality and incest.
   But the magazine's editors said that boycotts mounted by
religious groups over the content of the magazine have been
resolved and they say advertising pages were up 53 percent this
year compared with a year ago.
   The December issue contained about 55 pages of ads in a 100-page
book.
   Its guaranteed circulation is 550,000 and is scheduled to rise
to 650,000 next year. But it still trails other magazines aimed at
teen girls such as Seventeen at 1.75 million, Teen at 1.1 million
and YM at 1 million.
   Alx Mironovich, publisher of YM, said he thinks the
reader-produced issue was ``a gimmick to get attention from
advertisers.''
benefit by comparison. ``The photography was poor. The fashion
layouts were not appealing. The cover was amateurish. I don't think
this is what a consumer looks for in a magazine,'' he said.
   Ms. Pratt, on the other hand, said the issue helped Sassy
editors better understand their readers and how to communicate with
them.
intends to make regular features. One is a comic strip. The
magazine intends to run one from different readers of every month.
   But it also had some problems. A fiction piece on the end of the
world was dumped because ``it wasn't as good as the other stuff,''
Ms. Pratt said, and some photographs were too dark because of poor
lighting techniques.
   NOnetheless, Ms. Pratt said she intends to have another
reader-produced issue next December. ``We are the only magazine
that could do this and make it work,'' she said.

   The stock market gained ground Monday, picking
up where it left off in last week's advance, even though oil prices
and interest rates turned upward.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 61.64 points last
week, rose 15.10 to 2,565.35.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
902 up, 624 down and 475 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 140.95 million
shares, down from 165.44 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 171.84 million shares.
   On Friday the Federal Reserve took the latest in a series of
steps toward a gradual easing of its credit policy.
   Stock prices still seemed to benefit from that development
Monday, despite an upturn in open-market interest rates and oil
prices.
   Crude oil for December delivery climbed $1.72 a barrel to $31.50
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   In the government securities market, prices of long-term
Treasury bonds dropped more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value,
pushing their yields back up to around the 8.5 percent level.
   However, brokers said investors in stocks seemed to view
developments in those other markets as temporary, influenced by
shifts in the fickle tenor of news reports coming out of the Middle
East.
   In any case, a generally quiet week is expected on Wall Street,
given the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday and a light schedule of
economic news.
   Trading will take place on Friday, but the session after
Thanksgiving is often one of the slowest of the year in the
financial world.
   USF&amp;G fell 2&rsqb; to 7} as the most active Big Board issue. A Wall
Street Journal article quoted analysts as saying the company's
recent woes might worsen further.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up ~ at 49;
International Business Machines, up 1&lsqb; at 114}; Eastman Kodak, up 1
at 43, and Exxon, up \ at 50|.
   Claire's Stores fell 1{ to 11\. The company reported that
earnings in the third quarter ended Nov. 3 edged up to 18 cents a
share from 17 cents a share in the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $14.52 billion, or
0.49 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.04 to 174.34.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.08 to 374.31, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.22 at 319.34.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.88 to 352.73. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 296.47, down 1.05.

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Pushed Higher by Record Cash Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Record high cash prices for cattle prodded the futures market
upward Monday at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cash cattle reached a record 82.50 cents a pound at Kansas City
and there was talk that buyers were paying 83 cents at some
markets, said Charlie Richardson of Lind-Waldock &amp; Co. in Denver.
   On other markets, soybean and grain futures were mostly higher,
as were oil and gold.
   While cattle futures followed an upward trend, they were
somewhat restrained by fears that cash prices might be too high and
by uncertainty generated by the government's seven-state
cattle-on-feed report, released after the close.
   That report showed the number of cattle on feed as of Nov. 1 -
8.74 million head - at the high end of what the market was
expecting.
   ``This may put a little pressure on the deferred months, but
maybe not too much pressure since futures prices are already so far
under cash,'' said Richardson.
   The runup in futures prices has been restrained because ``people
keep expecting more fed cattle to come to market, but it just
hasn't happened,'' he said.
   Live cattle futures settled .08 cent to .38 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at 79.32 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent higher with January at 87.80 cents
a pound; live hogs were .12 cent lower to .22 cent higher with
December at 53.60 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .08
cent to 1.43 cents higher with February at 72.20 cents a pound.
   Grain traders at the Chicago Board of Trade, keenly aware of the
food shortages in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, are watching
for signs that point toward increased exports.
   Strong commercial buying of grain and soybean futures last week
gave some substance to rumors that a huge U.S.-Soviet grain pact
was in the works, said William Biedermann, research director of
Allendale Inc., of Crystal Lake, Ill.
   Prices edged upward again Monday, but with restraint.
   ``The market's saying, `I hear you, but I want to see it,''' he
said.
   This is reflected in the cash market, too, where supplies are
extremely tight because farmers are sitting on their harvests.
   ``The farmers locked it up and threw the key away,'' Biedermann
said. They ``know that come springtime, they'll be the only store
in town.''
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 2{ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $2.52} a bushel; corn was 1} cents to 2}
cents higher with December at $2.27{ a bushel; oats were \ cent to
} cent lower with December at $1.11{ a bushel; and soybeans were {
cent lower to 2\ cents higher with November at $5.69 a bushel.
   Gold futures at the Commodity Exchange in New York responded to
the fluctuations in the crude oil market, but within a more narrow
range.
   The weekend offer by Iraq to release Western hostages sent oil
futures into a decline on the opening, but this softness was
quickly overtaken by the unfolding events in the Mideast and
Washington.
   ``Gold made its lows for the day on the opening, but then the
rhetoric rallied oil, and then gold followed,'' said Bette
Raptopoulos, metals analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   First came word that Iraq plans on sending an additional 250,000
troops into Kuwait, followed by Iraq's annoyance at the cold
reception the Bush administration gave to its hostage-release
offer.
   Gold settled $1.70 to $2.50 higher with December at $382.30 a
troy ounce; silver was 9 cents to 10 cents lower with December at
$4.14 a troy ounce.
   Light sweet crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange
settled 5 cents lower to $1.72 a barrel higher with the December
contract at $31.50; heating oil was .15 cent to 2.34 cents higher
with December at 86.76 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was
1.26 cents to 2.73 cents higher with December at 80.36 cents a
gallon.

   The dollar traded mostly lower Monday, but it
was boosted above its lows of the day by news that Iraq was moving
more troops to Kuwait, traders said.
   Gold prices rose. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled
at $381.40 a troy ounce, up $2.50 from Friday. Republic National
Bank also quoted a late bid of $381.40, up $2.40 from Friday.
   The dollar was mixed against major currencies in European
trading. Traders said it was hurt by the Federal Reserve's decision
Friday to ease interest rates, which tends to make the dollar less
valuable in relation to other currencies.
   That downward pressure on the dollar continued when domestic
markets opened, said Lorenzo Troni, vice president of foreign
exchange at PaineWebber Inc.
   ``And then we had the news that Iraq was sending some more
troops on the border with Kuwait. The dollar strengthened a bit,''
Troni said.
   He said there was no economic news of substance Monday ``and so
the political news was what moved the market.''
   The dollar traditionally is viewed as a safe-haven investment in
times of international turmoil.
   The dollar lost ground against the British pound and the
Japanese yen, but strengthened somewhat against the German mark.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.95 yen, down 0.78 yen from
Friday's finish of 129.73 yen. Later in London, the dollar was
quoted at 128.20 yen. In New York it was quoted at 128.75 yen, down
from 129.50 late Friday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9745 from $1.9655 late
Friday. In New York, one pound cost $1.9750, more expensive than
$1.9660 late Friday.
   The dollar bought 1.4745 marks in European trading, up from
1.4715 Friday. In New York, the dollar traded at 1.4717 marks, from
1.4705 late Friday. Friday's figure was a post-war low for the
dollar against the mark.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.2450 Swiss francs, down from 1.2465; 4.9645
French francs, down from 4.9685; 1,108 Italian lire, down from
1,109.50; and 1.1634 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1633.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.2465 Swiss francs, up from 1.2445; 4.9745 French
francs, up from 4.9690; 1.6628 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6595;
1,110.25 Italian lire, unchanged; and 1.1628 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1643.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $379.60 a troy ounce, from
$376.75 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $378.75, from
$376.20 bid late Friday. In Hong Kong, gold dropped $2.56 an ounce
to close at $377.55.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.14 a troy ounce, down from $4.15
late Friday. In London, silve rose to a late bid price of $4.15 a
troy ounce from $4.11 bid late Friday.

   The government could save $274.1 billion in
medical costs in the year 2000 by regulating fees and replacing
private insurance companies with universal public coverage,
consumer groups said Monday.
   ``We can guarantee affordable, high-quality health care for all
Americans,'' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA
Foundation. ``We can do it by controlling doctor and hospital costs
and by cutting the red tape that really is the only thing the
insurance companies produce.''
   The Health Insurance Association of America, an organization
representing private insurers, said the groups wanted to drum up
support for health care funded and administered by the government.
   ``Such a system would lead to health care rationing, which most
Americans will not accept, and would cost an estimated $245 billion
annually, which most Americans will not abide,'' association
spokesman Donald B. White said in a statement.
   A report by Families USA Foundation and Citizen Action said the
government should limit fee increases levied by doctors, hospitals
and other health care providers.
   Such controls, similar to those now imposed in the Medicare
program, would reduce from 8.6 percent to 6.6 percent the projected
annual health care inflation rate and save $245.7 billion
nationwide by the year 2000, the report said.
   Doctors and hospitals could achieve the required savings without
reducing quality by eliminating unnecessary treatment and holding
down increases in providers' income, the report said. Unnecessary
high-tech equipment purchases and facility construction should be
avoided, it said.
   Replacing the nation's 1,500 private insurers with a single
provider would save another $53 billion in the year 2000, the
report said. Under a national system, health care could be
administered by the federal government, the states or a
``quasi-public entity,'' Families USA Foundation spokesman Arnold
Bennett said.
   ``You're getting rid of an industry that is pencil pushers,''
Bennett said.
   The report said examples of the private insurers' administrative
waste include diverse and duplicative payment rules; differing
rates; high advertising costs; and excessive profits.
   It estimated that providing medical insurance to all Americans
would require additional spending of $24.3 billion at the turn of
the century.
   High administrative costs are borne disproportionately by small
businesses and individuals who must purchase their own coverage,
the report said. For every dollar of health care costs paid by
groups of one to four people, 40 cents goes for administration.
Groups of 100 to 150 pay 16 cents per dollar for administrative
costs.
   White, the industry spokesman, agreed that 25 to 30 percent of
health care services in the United States are unnecessary. But he
described as ironic the criticism of administrative expenses, which
he said cover ``systems that clamp down on unnecessary spending and
help make health insurance more affordable.''
   Costs can best be controlled by giving private insurers more
flexibility to cover smaller businesses and granting those
businesses tax breaks so they can better afford group coverage,
White said. Also, public coverage for the poor and near-poor should
be expanded, he said.
   The consumer groups said they calculated their figures using the
latest available government statistics on private and public health
care spending in each state and estimates of future spending based
on age, income and other demographic information.

<HEAD>CBS Expects to Post Loss for Fourth Qtr</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. said Monday it expects to post a loss
in the fourth quarter because of a weak advertising market and
unexpectedly large losses on its television broadcasts of major
league baseball.
   The company also said it expects lower earnings from continuing
operations for all of 1991 compared with this year.
   The glum forecast comes as CBS reportedly planned a meeting with
its affiliates board to propose a reduction in the estimated $160
million the network pays about 200 affiliated stations for carrying
its shows.
   Media analysts said they expected CBS would post a loss for the
last three months of 1990 and an earnings decline in 1991.
   Analyst Jeff Russell of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. said
CBS would lose about $35 million in the quarter and earnings will
fall to about $205 million in 1991 from about $230 million in 1990.
   In reaction to the news, CBS shares dropped $4 to close at
$159.75 in trading of New York Stock Exchange issues.
   CBS isn't the only media company suffering because of a slowdown
this quarter in national ad spending growth.
   Capital Cities-ABC Inc., which operates the ABC Television
Network, said last month as it reported a decline in profit in the
third quarter that it expected a decline in earnings for the fourth
quarter as well.
   Like CBS, Capital Cities-ABC has been hurt by losses on major
league baseball coverage at its 80 percent-owned ESPN cable TV
network.
   The third major network, NBC, is owned by General Electric Co.
which does not report separately on its broadcasting subsidiary's
performance.
   CBS's unspecified loss projected for the fourth quarter would be
its first excluding special items since the company lost $20
million on continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 1986,
spokesman Kewith Fawcett said.
   CBS earned $59.5 million, or $2.31 a share, in the fourth
quarter of 1989.
   This was the first year of CBS's four-year baseball contract
which allows it to carry several regular season games along with
the league championship series, World Series and All-Star game.
   While the network reportedly expected to lose about $35 million
in the first year of the $1.06 billion contract, the losses are
said to have run much higher. CBS Sports President Neal Pilson has
said only that the loss on baseball was under $100 million.
   On Monday, CBS said losses on baseball were ``higher than
anticipated'' as the result of soft demand in the ad marketplace
for time on sports programs and because the World Series and one of
the two league championships were settled in four games instead of
the maximum seven.
   The short series meant CBS had fewer nights of baseball on which
to sell advertising. Games later in a series also tend to draw
bigger audiences, making them more valuable to advertisers.
   CBS said its TV network would have had a loss for the fourth
quarter even without baseball, because of the soft ad marketplace.
   It said the marketplace weakness has dampened demand for
network, local TV and radio advertising, and said network ad prices
have been particulartly soft for National Football League and
primetime broadcasts, where CBS ratings have improved.
   In projecting a decline in earnings from continuing operations
in 1991 compared with 1990, CBS cited the worsening economic
climate for advertising and rising costs for entertainment programs
and sports rights.
   Another reason is that the 1990 figures include profits on the
coverage of the NFL Super Bowl and the National Basketball
Association playoffs and championship that the network will not
have rights to in 1991.
   ``As a result, the CBS Television Network is currently expected
to show an operating loss in 1991,'' the statement said.
   Russell said his firm expects the CBS TV Network will post a
profit of about $10 million for 1990 and lose about $35 million
next year.

<HEAD>Report: Policy Makers Must Address High Business Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government policy makers must help bring down the
cost of doing business in New England in order to turn around the
region's slumping economy, according to a report issued Monday.
   The report from Bank of Boston Corp. says some costs, such as
wages and housing, will drop naturally as the economy continues its
slide. But government officials can assist in other areas where
economic cycles play a smaller role, such as health care costs and
workers compensation.
   ``Two weeks after the election of four new governors in New
England, we want to point out that the current debate has yet to
focus on the issue of the cost of doing business,'' said Wayne
Ayers, chief economist for Bank of Boston, who helped prepare the
report.
   ``So much attention during the election was understandably
focused on fiscal problems,'' he said. ``But the (state) budget to
any extent is a reflection of the underlying health of the
economy.''
   Ayers said high business costs not only threaten to further
erode New England's shrinking manufacturing base, but also could
hurt the region's services sector.
   He said the services sector cannot prosper when attorneys,
accountants and other vendors have nothing to service.
   ``We need a core manufacturing base, and therefore lowering the
cost of doing business is critical,'' he said.
   According to the study:
   - Housing prices, although declining, are still above the
national average and make it difficult to recruit new workers to
the region.
   - Medical care costs have raised health insurance premiums in
New England by 13 percent a year, about 3 percentage points above
the national average. The effect has raised the cost of doing
business in New England, compared to the rest of the nation, by
about $1,000 per employee per year.
   - Workers compensation is more expensive in New England than
elsewhere, and the problem is worse today than at the height of the
economic boom of the mid-1980s.
   Ayers said the weak economy would ``take its toll'' on housing
prices and wages.
   ``As painful as the process is, it is necessary for any kind of
recovery,'' he said.
   Ayers also said the region's business costs have been
exacerbated by the Persian Gulf crisis, which has increased higher
oil prices and added to the high bills paid by companies.
   Despite the gloom, the region has many strengths, the report
said, including emerging technology companies, a strong research
and education base, foreign trade and a skilled work force.

   A New York stock brokerage and its president
were fined $650,000 and permanently barred from dealings with the
National Association of Securities Dealers Monday for allegedly
overcharging customers.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Ted Lawrence Rubin and
his firm, First Fidelity Capital Corp., settled the NASD
allegations.
   The NASD charged that Rubin and the firm charged fraudulently
excessive markups totaling $510,000 on the securities of Resource
Network International, for which First Fidelity Capital Corp. was
the underwriter of the initial public offering.
   The NASD is a self-regulating organization empowered by Congress
to oversee the over-the-counter market for securities which are not
traded on stock exchanges.
   It can fine and suspend firms and inviduals, expel firms from
the NASD or bar individuals from associating with any NASD member
firm.
   As part of the settlement, Rubin is barred from associating with
any NASD member in any capacity. The firm was expelled from NASD
membership.

<HEAD>F.W. Dodge Reports 20 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction fell 20 percent in the
third quarter, with the Northeast suffering the largest decline, a
survey released Monday said.
   F.W. Dodge, the construction information division of McGraw-Hill
Inc., said starts on new houses, condominiums and apartments
totaled 299,299 units in the July-September period, down from
371,792 in the same period in 1989.
   Only three of the nation's 25 largest homebuilding areas showed
gains in the period, F.W. Dodge said. They were Phoenix, Dallas and
Indianapolis.
   All five major regions of the country reported declines from
third-quarter 1989 totals.
   ``The Northeast, with its 36 percent setback, continued to set
the downward pace,'' said George A. Christie, vice president and
chief economist at Dodge.
   ``The North and South Central regions, with smaller than average
cutbacks, dampened the general collapse,'' he said. ``Closest to
the 20 percent national average decline in housing starts were the
Southeast and Southwest.''

<HEAD>Chairman of N.Y. Mercantile Exchange Sued by Ex-Partner</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of one of the world's biggest futures
exchanges is being sued for $3 million by an ex-partner for
allegedly failing to repay money he borrowed to cover losses on
commodities deals.
   New York Mercantile Exchange Chairman Z. Lou Guttman's losses
mounted as he conducted trades in cotton, copper, sugar, crude oil,
coffee, cocoa and currencies, according to the attorney for Harold
Magid, a futures trader who claims to have set up a joint venture
with Guttman in 1987.
   Guttman was losing money through his personal account, which at
times did not contain enough cash to meet the requirements of
exchanges he was trading on, so he borrowed money from the joint
venture after promising it would be repaid, lawyer Neal Schwarzfeld
said Monday.
   Guttman referred inquiries to his lawyer, David Yeres.
   ``The allegations are bogus and contrived,'' Yeres said Monday.
He said he plans to respond in detail through his own court filing.
   Magid and Guttman became partners in the joint venture through
which they would equally share profits and losses from futures
trading, according to Magid's lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court,
which is a trial-level court in New York.
   Their brokerage functions were performed by an entity known as
Harley Futures Inc., which they jointly owned, the lawsuit said.
They also hoped to share commissions and management fees from
business they were able to generate for a separate trading firm,
Gerald Commodities Inc., the lawsuit said.
   Guttman was to supervise Harley's business and use his status as
chairman of the Mercantile Exchange to solicit additional business,
the lawsuit said.
   The joint venture, set up with $300,000 deposited by Guttman and
Magid, immediately began turning a profit of $30,000 to $40,000 per
month. Eventually, it had made millions, the lawsuit said.
   But Guttman began losing money through a personal account, and
Magid agreed to let him borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars
from the partnership. The money was lent with the understanding
that Guttman would repay it, but payments never came and eventually
the joint venture fell so short of cash it had to liquidate many of
its futures positions, the lawsuit said.
   After Magid stopped doing business with Guttman in August, Magid
found that he was temporarily ``blackballed'' in the commodities
trading community because of his dispute with Guttman, Schwarzfeld
alleged.
   A Mercantile Exchange spokeswoman said the exchange would not
comment on whether it was looking into the allegations contained in
Magid's lawsuit. The exchange's policy is to comment only when
alleged wrongdoing is found.

<HEAD>Nation's Largest Chain to Buy Erol's Inc.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blockbuster Entertainment Corp.
announced a $40 million deal Monday to buy Erol's Inc., which owns
and operates 208 videocassette rental and sales stores in five
states and Washington, D.C.
   Blockbuster, the nation's largest video chain, will acquire
Erol's operations in exchange for cash, a note, Blockbuster common
stock and debt assumption, the Fort Lauderdale-based company said.
   H. Wayne Huizenga, Blockbuster's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the agreement in principle ``provides an outstanding
opportunity for Blockbuster and its franchise owners to broaden the
base of our stores.''
   ``The proposed acquisition is in the best interest of Erol's,
its employees and customers, particularly in view of Blockbuster's
significant financial resources,'' said Erol's founder and
principal stockholder, Erol Onaran.
   The sale is contingent on the execution of a definitive
acquisition agreement and the approval of lenders.
   Blockbuster also opened its 1,500th store Monday, in Vancouver,
British Columbia. In all, the chain has stores in 44 states, the
District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Canada and England.

<HEAD>Casino Company Posts Third-Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resorts International Inc., which
emerged from bankruptcy in August, posted a third-quarter profit,
according to results released Monday by the casino company.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, Resorts recorded a net gain
of $6.9 million on revenues of $109.0 million, compared to a loss
of $2.2 million in the third quarter of 1989 on revenues of $124.3
million.
   The plan that took Resorts out of Chapter 11 reduced its
outstanding bonds by $429.8 million from $911 million. Bondholders
received 78 percent ownership in the company in exchange for the
reduced debt.
   That reduction of $429.8 million was recorded as an
extraordinary credit this quarter. Balanced against a $153.2
million downward re-evaluation of Resorts' assets, the company
recorded a skewed net gain of $259.7 million.
   ``The changes in accounting as of August 31 make it difficult to
precisely compare the 1990 numbers to the 1989 numbers,'' Resorts
president David Hanlon said in a news release. ``However, we have
definitely shown an improvement in our earnings from operations.''
   Resorts owns Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino Hotel and the
Paradise Island casino in the Bahamas. The company hopes to sell
the Bahamian property before the end of 1991.
   In its quarterly report filed with the federal Securities and
Exchange Commission, Resorts said that revenues may suffer from the
recession, rising fuel costs' effect on airfares and increased
competition in Atlantic City from the Taj Mahal casino and in the
Bahamas from Crystal Palace.
