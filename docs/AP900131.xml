   President Bush won Democratic praise Wednesday
night for his plan to cut U.S. and Soviet forces in Central Europe,
while Senate GOP leader Bob Dole said the proposal would put the
United States ``on the offensive'' at the bargaining table.
   Rep. Les Aspin, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, said ``the president should be congratulated''
for the plan, outlined in a State of the Union address.
   ``Trying to negotiate lower limits on forces deployed in Europe
is clearly a good idea,'' said the Wisconsin Democrat.
   Said Dole: ``The ball is now in (Soviet leader Mikhail)
Gorbachev's court.''
   At the same time they were hailing his troop cut proposal,
Democrats made plain their intention to battle with Bush over other
issues in the current election-year session of Congress.
   In a nationally televised speech that served as the formal
Democratic response, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said his party
would work with the president ``wherever and whenever we can. On
some issues, we will have difference because we care deeply about
certain principles,'' he said.
   He scoffed at Bush's call for a ``meager'' 2 percent rise in
education spending, and said Democrats would battle the
administration this year on legislation dealing with capital gains
taxes, child care and clean air. As for abortion, he said, ``We
will continue to defend a woman's right to choose, for we are
convinced that politicians cannot and should not attempt to make
the choice.''
   House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri faulted
Bush for not being ``more specific about how he intends to
strengthen our economy and lift the economic fortunes of people who
work for a living.''
   Republicans applauded Bush's statement that the ``last thing we
need to do is mess around with Social Security,'' with GOP House
Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia saying the president's position ``is
going to be clearly the only acceptable political position _ saying
that nothing affecting benefits can be considered.''
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., in an attempt to block the
government from using surplus Social Security taxes, has proposed
rolling back a tax increase that took effect Jan. 1 and to reduce
another increase scheduled for next year.
   Following the speech, Moynihan said despite Bush's promise not
to fool with Social Security, ``They're messing around (with Social
Security) where they're using the trust fund as general revenue.''
   Overall, Dole called Bush's speech ``an optimistic `can do'
State of the Union, which advances a hope agenda, one in sharp
contrast with the Democrat's nope agenda.''
   But House Democratic Whip William Gray, D-Pa., said Bush's
speech ``ought to be introduced to his budget. There's a
disconnect.''
   But domestic issues aside, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle
chorused their praise of Bush's proposal to reduce troops in the
so-called ``Central Front'' in Europe to 195,000 for each
superpower.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said Bush ``skillfully seized the element
of surprise and thereby seized the opportunity to put the United
States back into the forefront of negotiations to reduce
conventional forces.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said the reduction plan ``makes the arms control
proposal that we have on the table much more relevant to the
changing circumstances in Europe and also much more in keeping with
some of our fiscal pressures.''
   Earlier in the day, Foley told reporters he ``would welcome a
suggestion that we could make further troop cuts in Europe.''
   ``I don't think the United States should totally withdraw from
Western Europe, but very substantial reductions are not only
possible, but I think inevitable,'' he said.
   Bush's proposal is a response to the tumultuous changes in
Eastern Europe, where the push for democracy has led to the
downfall of hardline Communist regimes.
   One longtime advocate of reduced U.S. troops in Europe, Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said she was ``delighted'' with the
plan. ``There's hope,'' Schroeder said.
   ``Just when you thought you had a Cold War budget _ boom,'' said
Schroeder, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee.
   Aspin coupled his praise with a caution: ``We should be careful
in this whole process not to give the Soviet Union a reason to keep
more troops in Eastern Europe than it would without an agreement.
For both sides it should be a ceiling, not a floor.''
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said Bush ``is rushing to catch the
reality of Eastern Europe.''
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said the United States was
``falling behind the curve of popular will'' on the issue of troop
reductions.
   Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., a member of the House Armed Services
Committee and the Democratic Caucus' point-man on defense,
questioned the absence of a military strategy from the
administration.
   ``It was unwise to build up on military strength in the 1980's
without a national strategy. But it is even more dangerous to build
down without one,'' McCurdy said.
   Dole defended the president as a middle-of-the-road president.
   ``Ultra liberals and ultra conservatives may not like tonight's
speech, which tells me George Bush is right in step with the
American people,'' he said.

   A blizzard is blowing and dawn is an hour
away, but Socialist candidate Nobutaka Tsutsui is shivering at a
factory gate, trying to entice votes away from the conservatives
who have governed Japan for 35 years.
   Wrapped in a wool coat and fortified by hand-warmers in his
pockets, he zeroes in on the unpopular sales tax that the Liberal
Democratic government introduced last year _ called a consumption
tax in Japan.
   ``Good morning. My name is Nobutaka Tsutsui,'' the smiling,
45-year-old candidate for Parliament tells workers as they arrive
or leave during a shift-change at an electronics factory.
   ``Let's join our forces to scrap the disgusting consumption tax,
and end the LDP's tyranny.''
   No fancy speech about socialism, and he gets encouraging
responses even in this traditionally conservative, rice-growing
constituency in northern Japan's snow country.
   ``Good luck,'' says a young woman in a factory uniform. ``I will
vote for you to get rid of the consumption tax, and so will many of
my friends.''
   The Socialists are counting on millions of like-minded people to
knock the Liberal Democrats into the minority when ballots are
counted from the Feb. 18 election, which is expected to set the
tone for Japanese politics in the 1990s.
   The conservative party appears to be facing the greatest threat
ever to its dominance. Socialist candidates like Tsutsui, a
populist lawyer who wears trendy clothes and moves around the
snow-bound district in a four-wheel-drive Mitsubishi, are expected
to grab many normally conservative votes.
   The Liberal Democratic Party now holds 295 of the 512 seats in
the lower house of Parliament. Polls indicate it could lose its
majority in the chamber, which elects the prime minister.
   The Socialists are the largest opposition group, and have a
chance to increase their seats from 85 now to more than 140 under
the leadership of popular chairwoman Takako Doi.
   If that happens and the parties, with their deep ideological
divides, try to form a coalition government, Japan could be headed
for a period of political uncertainty.
   Tsutsui fell 7,000 votes short of a seat in the last election in
1986, but he is regarded as front-runner among a half-dozen
candidates vying for the two seats in the constituency.
   ``I am aware I have some advantages this time,'' he said as he
plowed through the snow in a jeep. ``But my weakness is that I
still lack prominence compared with the Liberal Democrat
incumbents.''
   If Tsutsui wins, one of the two Liberal Democrat incumbents will
be out. Four-term legislator Katsuhiko Shirakawa, 44, is trying
hard to win that other seat.
   ``This is nothing but a fight for political survival for me,''
Shirakawa said as he was driven from one campaign stop to the next.
   He told about 25 factory managers who gathered at a supporter's
house in rural Takada, ``I can protect the interests of people in
the Jyoetsu district and make the area thrive.''
   ``New train lines and new highways are going to be built in the
next four to six years as a result of my efforts,'' said Shirakawa,
fixing his gaze on each person in the audience in turn. ``We can
expect a huge amount of public works, followed by hundreds of
thousands of tourists and new business opportunities.''
   Pork barrel politics is the origin of much of the Liberal
Democrats' success over past decades as they spread public works
around Japan, enabling them to campaign on a record of bringing
local prosperity while building Japan.
   Shirakawa is appealing to company executives, small-business
owners and farmers, trying to persuade them that he can help the
local economy grow.
   He says he has no way of stopping those who dislike the sales
tax from voting Socialist, so he tries to ``strengthen my grip on
the conservative votes and try not to let them go to the Socialist
or the other conservative party candidate.''
   The tax, which imposes a 3 percent levy on all goods and
services, has become the focal point of the campaign. Polls
indicate more than a third of voters pegged the tax as the No. 1
issue. Less than 10 percent thought the big issue was socialism vs.
conservatism _ the Liberal Democrats' campaign theme.
   Hurt by sex and bribery scandals and the sales tax, the Liberal
Democrats lost their majority in the upper house in July elections,
and two prime ministers from the party had to resign last year in
an extraordinary show of political disarray.
   Opposition parties are united in their calls to scrap the tax
entirely. The Liberal Democrats insist it is essential to support
the budget in the 21st century, though they promise to review and
improve the tax.
   ``I just hope that too many voters ... won't turn to the
Socialists only because of the tax issue, disregarding other
important national and international issues,'' Shirakawa told about
50 female workers at a backer's semiconductor factory who had
gathered during a lunch break.
   At about the same time, Tsutsui was kneeling on a reed-mat floor
with about 25 people in the home of a supporter, telling them
``Japan needs a new type of leadership that is fitting for a new
era, but the LDP is suffering from metal fatigue and it must be
replaced.
   ``And the very first thing we should do is to scrap the
consumption tax, which we all hate. The tax has a symbolic
significance of what a long one-party dominance will cause.''

   Air Force Gen. Samuel
Phillips, who headed NASA's Apollo program when the United States
put the first man on the moon, died Wednesday of heart failure. He
was 68.
   Phillips, who retired as a four-star Air Force general in 1975,
headed the Apollo Lunar Landing Program of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration from 1964 to 1969.
   He returned to NASA in 1986 to conduct a management review and
recommend changes in the wake of the Challenger disaster.
   Phillips' long and distinguished Air Force career included tours
as director of the Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missile
Program from 1959-1963, vice commander of the Ballistic Systems
Division at Norton Air Force Base (San Bernardino) from 1963-1964,
and commander of Air Force Systems Command at Andrews AFB
(Maryland) from 1973 to 1975.
   After retiring from the Air Force, Phillips joined TRW in El
Segundo as general manager of its Energy Systems Management
Division. In 1984, he became vice president of TRW's Defense
Systems Group. He retired from TRW in 1986, but continued to serve
in an advisory capacity.
   Phillips is survived by his wife, Betty Anne, and three
daughters, Dana McMenamin of Sacramento, Janie Phillips of El
Segundo and Kathleen Esposito of Redondo Beach.

   A newspaper publisher and writer have
been charged with criminal libel for failing to publish the full
name of a policeman criticized in an article.
   The misdemeanor charges, stemming from a rarely used provision
of Florida law, were filed Monday against former Polk County
sheriff-turned-newspaper publisher Dan Daniels, and former Eagle
Lake City Commission candidate Dave Whitacre.
   Polk State Attorney Jerry Hill said the two failed to publish
the full name of Eagle Lake police officer Roy T. Harper in an
article in The Eagle, which is published in this central Florida
community. The newspaper accused the officer of ``lies, threats and
theft.''
   Harper said he found a Florida law makes it a first-degree
misdemeanor for a writer or publisher to make accusations of
immoral conduct against a person unless the article contains ``in
full the true name of the person intended to be charged with the
commission of such acts of immorality.''
   The article in a January issue of The Eagle referred to Harper
only as ``Roy.''
   Whitacre, the author of the article, said he didn't use Harper's
full name ``because I didn't want to humiliate his family.''
   Daniels' number is unlisted, and there was no answer Tuesday
afternoon at the newspaper office.

<HEAD>Students at Private University Decry `Druggie' Image</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Heather Harlan transferred to
Wesleyan University last year, she had an image of a school with
rigorous academic standards and a long tradition of liberalism.
   Now, Harlan and other students find themselves defending the
private university against a new ``druggie'' label they say has
been unfairly pinned on the central Connecticut school.
   ``The whole thing has been blown out of proportion,'' said
Harlan, who transferred from New York University. ``I've seen
people use drugs, but I'd say the overwhelming majority of students
don't use drugs.''
   Wesleyan's image problem stemmed from an incident last October
when only one student was arrested among an estimated 400 attending
an annual campus marijuana-smoking party known as the ``Smoke
Out.'' Some students estimated 100 students smoked marijuana at the
party.
   A storm of publicity followed the Oct. 27 party, most of it
focusing on assertions by several students that Wesleyan
administrators were willing to look the other way when it came to
drug use and did little to stop the party.
   ``They didn't really do anything to stop it. They brought in a
few cops instead of a whole army,'' said sophomore Marc Flacks.
   Wesleyan spokesman Bobby Wayne Clark defended the single arrest
made during the party, saying by the time police arrived, most of
the students who were smoking pot had stashed it.
   But three months later, the 3,400-student university is still
reeling from the unwanted attention.
   And although administrators insist they are not soft on drugs,
the hullabaloo has prompted them to review the school's drug policy.
   Dean Edgar Beckham said administrators are considering
strengthening the wording of their policy to get out a tougher
message about the school's attitude toward drugs.
   Wesleyan's current policy is to work with Middletown police to
make drug arrests on campus, including tipping them off when they
know a big party is scheduled where drugs are likely to be used,
Beckham said.
   The university's code of conduct defines the sale of any illegal
drug as a ``serious breach.'' Possession of cocaine and heroin also
has that classification, but the code does not specifically mention
marijuana or LSD.
   Students who break the university's rules are subject to
penalties ranging from a warning letter to expulsion.
   Beckham said the school is considering either deleting any
mention to specific drugs so as not to give the impression some
drugs are condoned, or adding marijuana and LSD to the list of
drugs considered serious breaches.
   But many students and administrators said they were tired of
defending a policy they say does not need defending.
   ``When we're encouraging police to come on campus and make
arrests whenever possible, then I would say that's a harsh policy,
not a lenient policy,'' said Beckham.
   With an annual tuition approaching $15,000 and a competitive
admissions policy, students say Wesleyan is not a school where
people go to party.
   ``We're being called a druggie school, but I don't think that's
accurate, compared to other institutions,'' said senior Eric Ford.
   But there are students who think administrators should put more
teeth into enforcement.
   A good place to start, they said, would be to crack down on
large campus parties, like the ``Smoke Out'' and ``Uncle Duke
Day,'' an event that is usually held the following day.
   ``Uncle Duke Day,'' named after the self-indulgent drug-abusing
character in the ``Doonesbury'' comic strip, is openly advertised
on campus, and students know the day's activities will include drug

   ``If you're going to do any type of drug enforcement at all, why
don't you start with the obvious _ Uncle Duke Day,'' said junior
Elan Grossman.
   But administrators said policing every party would be impossible.
   ``There are institutions that have codes that sound tough, but
aren't,'' said Clark. ``Wesleyan has a code that puts the burden of
responsibility on students, and we believe that works.''

   One of 12 known first editions of Edgar Allan
Poe's first published book sold at auction for $165,000, Sotheby's
said.
   The book, ``Tamerlane and Other Poems,'' went to a private
American collector, said Laura Stewart, a spokeswoman for the

   The copy sold was one of two in private hands; the other sold at
Sotheby's last year for $198,000, Stewart said.
   Also Tuesday, a four-page autographed letter by Herman Melville
to Nathaniel Hawthorne's wife was bought for $132,000 by Profiles

   In the Jan. 8, 1852, letter to Sophia Peabody Hawthorne, who had
complimented Melville on ``Moby Dick,'' the author denied that the
book contained any symbolism.
   Tuesday's sale of American literature and children's books from

   Sale of the collection was to continue today with Americana,
including George Washington's copy of ``The Federalist Papers.''

   The most powerful nuclear research
reactor of its kind has resumed limited operation at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory after being shut down for more than three years
by safety concerns.
   The High Flux Isotope Reactor was restarted Monday, Department
of Energy spokesman Steve Wyatt said.
   He said the reactor, which has a maximum power of 85 megawatts,
will operate at no more than 11 megawatts for the next few weeks as
part of a training and testing exercise for operators.
   A schedule for resuming full power will depend on the outcome of
the tests.
   The reactor is used to produce and study heavy man-made
elements. It also supplies special isotopes for medical and
industrial use and is used in irradiation testing for fusion and
fission reactor development.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Bill Including China Trade Sanctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is expected to sign legislation
that provides for trade sanctions against China, but allows the
president to suspend them if he finds it is in the national
interest.
   The Senate voted 98-0 late Tuesday for the measure, which was
passed by the House in November before Congress' two-month holiday
break.
   Prompted by Beijing's crackdown last June on pro-democracy
demonstrators, the sanctions are part of a $9.7 billion measure
authorizing activities of the State Department for the 1990 and
1991 fiscal years.
   The legislation would suspend:
   _Financial underwriting through the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation for U.S. companies doing business in China;
   _Aid under the Trade and Development Program;
   _Issuing licenses for controlled munitions or crime control and
detection equipment;
   _Export of U.S.-built satellites, certain bilateral nuclear
cooperation and liberalization of multilateral export controls.
   Most of the sanctions reflect actions Bush himself had already
taken in the wake of the bloody suppression of pro-democracy
demonstrations in Beijing on June 4, and their place in the bill is
regarded as mostly symbolic.
   The administration already has begun to lift some of those
sanctions, including the one barring export of satellites, citing
improved conditions in China.
   The bill approved Tuesday would permit Bush to terminate any of
the sanctions if significant political reform occurs in China or if
Bush finds waiver of the sanctions is ``in the national interest''
of the United States.
   There was almost no debate on the bill, in contrast to the
showdown last week over whether to uphold Bush's veto of a measure
that would have protected Chinese students in the United States
from deportation.
   The Senate narrowly upheld the veto after the White House waged
an all-out campaign to pressure Republican senators to back the
president. An administration official described the fight as ``not
a battle over how to handle China, but a battle over who should be
handling China.''
   Democrats used the occasion to again accuse Bush of too-cozy
relations with a regime that has done little to adhere to U.S.
human rights standards.
   The largest amounts in the bill _ $3.3 billion this year and
$3.7 billion next year _ are for the State Department, primarily
for salaries and the expenses of running embassies and consulates
around the world.
   Also included are about $2 billion over two years for the U.S.
Information Agency and $600 million for the Board for International
Broadcasting, which runs Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.
   Not voting were Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo.

<HEAD>Barry Accuser Testifies Before Grand Jury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors appear to be building a drug case
against Mayor Marion Barry by securing the cooperation of a man who
law enforcement sources say accused the mayor of drug use.
   James McWilliams, a District of Columbia employee, pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge Tuesday and then immediately
began testifying before a grand jury investigating Barry's ties to
convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis.
   ``This is another significant step in this investigation,'' U.S.
Attorney Jay B. Stephens said. ``The mayor's arrest was a
significant step, and this ... was a significant step too.''
   In another development, a source familiar with the case said
several members of the mayor's city security detail are expected to
testify before the grand jury in the near future.
   The guards _ who are assigned to the mayor on a round-the-clock
basis _ are expected to be asked whether they ever witnessed the
mayor using drugs or helped get drugs for him, said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   At a news conference, Stephens refused to say whether he intends
for the bodyguards to testify before the panel, but said
prosecutors ``will want to cover any witness that might be able to
provide information regarding this case.''
   Barry, who was arrested Jan. 18 on a misdemeanor cocaine
possession charge, has denied under oath using drugs with Lewis at
a downtown Washington hotel more than a year earlier, in December
1988.
   The charge against McWilliams stemmed from allegations of visits
to Lewis' hotel room, some of which prosecutors say coincided with
Barry's visits.
   Meanwhile, Washington's WRC-TV, quoting unnamed sources, said
Barry could be indicted within two weeks by the grand jury, which
has been looking into allegations of perjury and cocaine possession.
   McWilliams, a city motor vehicles department employee and a
longtime Lewis associate, declined to comment either before or
after his grand jury testimony. He pleaded guilty to a charge of
aiding and abetting drug possession, which carries a maximum
penalty of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.
   According to a source familiar with the case, McWilliams has
told authorities he was present once when the mayor and Lewis
disappeared into the bathroom of the hotel room for a short time.
   McWilliams told prosecutors he smelled crack cocaine and then
saw the mayor emerge from the bathroom under the influence of the
drug, the source said.
   The Washington Post, in today's editions, quoted Assistant U.S.
Attorney Richard W. Roberts as saying that during the hotel
episode, McWilliams loaned money to Lewis for Lewis to purchase
drugs and later lent his car to Lewis so that Lewis could go
purchase additional drugs.
   McWilliams, 57, was called before the grand jury investigating
the case last January but refused to testify.
   Carole Bland Jackson, a former business partner of the woman who
was in a hotel room when Barry was arrested this month in an FBI
sting, also said in weekend interviews that she was present when
Barry used cocaine at a 1986 party.
   The mayor is in Florida at a private facility being treated for
what aides say is primarily an alcohol abuse problem.
   Lewis pleaded guilty to cocaine conspiracy charges last November
in Washington and was convicted on cocaine distribution charges in
the Virgin Islands last spring.
   Lewis, who is cooperating with prosecutors, testified under oath
during his plea bargaining session in November that he supplied
Barry with crack cocaine.
   In meetings with prosecutors in the past week, McWilliams also
said the mayor called him after Barry's ties to Lewis became public
and told him he trusted him to keep quiet about what he had seen in
the hotel room, two law enforcement sources said.
   Barry has said he only called McWilliams to urge him to
cooperate with authorities investigating the case.

<TEXT>
   An institute devoted solely to AIDS research
will open this year in Manhattan, launched with $11.4 million in
foundation and city funds, and is expected to grow into one of the
world's largest AIDS laboratories.
   Dr. David Ho, 37, an AIDS researcher and member of the AIDS
Advisory Committee of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, will be
director of the new Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center.
   The center will concentrate on creating an AIDS vaccine and
preventing the damage AIDS causes to people already infected,
officials said.
   ``When a cure for AIDS is found, it will be in a place such as
this,'' Mayor David N. Dinkins said at a news conference.
   The sponsors said the center would rank in size with such
leading AIDS programs as the Pasteur Institute and the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., in about two years.
   The center, started with $3 million from the Diamond Foundation
and $3.4 million in city construction and renovation funds, is
expected to open in about six months and will be housed, rent-free,
in the city's Department of Health Laboratories building.
   The Diamond Foundation also has promised $1 million a year
toward the center's operating budget for the first five years.
   Its immediate goal is to attract about 50 topnotch scientists _
many of whom already have federal research grants _ and gather them
under one roof for collaboration, said Ho, who was lured from the
University of California at Los Angeles.
   Ho predicted it will take several years for researchers at the
center or elsewhere to develop a successful AIDS vaccine, and
several more years to put it into widespread use.
   The Diamond Foundation was established by the late real estate
developer Aaron Diamond, who died in 1984. It finances medical
research, minority education, arts and human rights programs.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of starving people are being
held captive in the besieged southern capital of Juba, where rebels
and army forces are at a standoff in some of the civil war's
fiercest fighting, relief workers say.
   The relief workers, who were evacuated from the city this week,
said Tuesday that government soldiers have prevented residents from
leaving so many people are digging trenches to shelter themselves
from rocket attacks by rebels ringing the city.
   ``Juba has become a death trap,'' said Irishman Daniel Eiffe.
``People live in terror from the shelling. This is a whole new
dimension.''
   Eiffe, of the Agency for Cooperation and Research in
Development, a London-based relief group, flew to Khartoum on
Monday with three other Westerners as part of a U.N. airlift.
   Fourteen other Westerners flew to Nairobi, Kenya, and they too
spoke of terror and starvation. An Italian doctor said he saw
security forces beat back two groups of people attempting to leave,
mainly women and children.
   Civilians fleeing the fighting in the countryside have swollen
Juba's population to nearly 300,000 and food is running out.
Another doctor who fled to Nairobi said people fear riots over the
meager stocks that remain.
   The angst is exacerbated by the uncertainty of what will come if
rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army end their long siege
of the city with a military advance.
   The rebels end broadcasts on their clandestine radio station
with the ominous sign-off: ``Black people be ready.''
   John Garang, a renegade army colonel, began the bush insurgency
in Africa's largest country in 1983. The rebels are fighting the
Moslem-dominated government in Khartoum for increased economic and
political autonomy for the predominantly Christian and animist
southern half of Sudan.
   Hundreds of thousands have died in the civil war, most of them
victims of a famine caused by farmers being driven from their
fields to seek refuge in government-controlled places like Juba,
750 miles south of the capital.
   The rebel push around Juba is their fiercest offensive in nearly
seven years. They have captured 11 communities south and west of
the city, virtually ending access to it by road.
   The army has 9,000 to 10,000 troops and several thousand armed
civilians and militia in Juba, which sits on the west bank of the
White Nile and is the largest town in southern Sudan.
   About 5,000 rebels are thought to surround the city; and
military sources in Khartoum said the insurgents lack the firepower
or manpower to take Juba.
   The rebels have shelled the city twice, on Jan. 21 and last
Friday. Eiffe said at least 23 civilians were killed in the
attacks. On Monday, rebel radio said the shelling would resume and
advised residents to leave.
   Eiffe said the city was paralyzed. He said businesses and
schools were closed and food distribution so limited that rations
were half of what is considered minimal daily fare under
international standards. More than half of Juba's residents are
displaced people who live in crude camps.
   The government banned relief flights to the south on Nov. 3
because of intensified fighting and Juba's only source of food has
been daily Sudan Airways flights chartered by the Lutheran World
Federation in Nairobi.
   The flights bring in 50 to 60 tons of food a day but the city
needs 150 tons a day to adequately feed people, relief workers say.
   ``The Sudan airways pilots are very brave,'' Eiffe said. ``They
fly in despite attacks on them.''
   ``Thousands of people gather around the Sudan Airways office in
Juba trying to get tickets out,'' he said. ``They fly out around 80
to 100 Sudanese daily.''
   Eiffe said Juba residents fearing new shelling had been crowding
into his office begging for shovels and picks to dig bunkers in
which to hide. Others fled to the deep banks of the Nile for
protection.
   Some of the Western evacuees blamed both the army and the rebels
for Juba's desperation. All spoke on condition they not be
identified by name or organization.
   They said the rebels shelled Juba indiscriminately with rockets
that make terrifying noises when they explode and burst into
hundreds of pieces of maiming shrapnel.
   The army in turn has planted land mines as part of a security
cordon around the city. The evacuees said the troops also refuse to
let residents leave, apparently hoping their presence will keep the
rebels from trying to invade.
   One evacuee said many Juba residents sympathize with the rebel
cause, but nobody can understand their purpose in shelling the city.
   He said residents listen to government and rebel propaganda and
feel trapped in the middle.
   ``A few weeks ago, food was the major concern,'' Eiffe said.
``Now that's changed, and it's terror from shelling.''

   After flying the coop unexpectedly, the Pirate

   The furry green costume, worn by the Pittsburgh Pirates' mascot,

   The Pirates said the costume is worth $8,000.
   The costume was taken Monday night by someone who broke into the

<HEAD>`Coupon' Connie Found Guilty in Conspiracy, Fraud Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite her federal fraud conviction, ``Coupon
Connie'' says her coupon-clipping was just the zealous performance
of a housewife's duty. But she'll never clip again.
   ``You should never use coupons,'' Connie Santos Arvidson said
Tuesday after being convicted in a $2 million counterfeit coupon
scheme. ``I won't ever again.''
   The Boca Raton, Fla., woman could be ordered imprisoned 15 years
when she is sentenced March 23 for mail fraud and conspiracy.
   She insisted during her three-week U.S. District Court trial
that she didn't know the manufacturers' coupons she began buying
and trading through a magazine advertisement were counterfeit.
   Co-defendant David Rees of Center Point was convicted of
conspiracy, and printer James Floyd Richards of San Antonio was
cleared of three counts.
   The defendants were accused of counterfeiting more than 600,000
copies of coupons issued by 47 companies, including Procter &amp;
Gamble, Nabisco Brands Inc. and Campbell Soup Co.
   Mrs. Arvidson, who has also been called the ``Dumpster Lady''
because she rooted through garbage bins looking for coupons, used
some to buy products and then sold them at flea markets, said
prosecutor Steve Sucsy. Her main income came through selling the
coupons for more than she paid for them, he said.
   ``Basically, it's just a story of greed,'' Sucsy said in closing
arguments. ``Her statement to the effect she was only doing what
any number of innocent housewives were doing was not so.''
   Prosecutors said Mrs. Arvidson purchased bogus coupons from San
Antonio counterfeiter David Rackmill.
   Rackmill pleaded guilty to mail fraud and conspiracy and acted
as an informant, as did six others indicted in the case.
   Mrs. Arvidson, 34, testified that she earned about $30,000 in
1988 in rebates, price breaks and free products from manufacturers
and used the proceeds to buy furniture, toys, to make a down
payment on a BMW and pay for cosmetic surgery for herself.
   The counterfeit ring was indicted in August after a four-month
investigation by the U.S. Postal Service.

<HEAD>Greenspan's Good News May be Bad News for Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan's good news message _ a lower risk of recession coupled
with stable inflation _ is being interpreted by financial markets
as bad news for interest rates.
   Greenspan, in testimony Tuesday to the congressional Joint
Economic Committee, said the risk of a recession in the next six
months to a year is lower now than it was last spring. Inflation,
while still unacceptably high at 4.5 percent, is stable, he said.
   His seemingly mild comments unsettled stock and bond markets,
where traders interpreted them as a sign the central bank will not
lower interest rates anytime soon. A volatile New York Stock
Exchange session ended with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
down 10.14 points.
   ``What he's really saying is ... if you want to get inflation
down it may be you have to live with crummy economic growth, not
for a few quarters, but for a few years,'' said economist Bruce
Steinberg of Merrill Lynch.
   That's a blow to President Bush's prospects of trimming the
federal budget deficit. Bush's budget released this week relies on
relatively strong growth to boost government revenue and lower
interest rates to hold down the cost of carrying the national debt.
Earlier this month, Bush pressed the Fed to lower interest rates.
   The Fed last eased just before Christmas when it nudged a key
bank lending rate down by a quarter of a percentage point. It was
the latest step in an effort begun in June to stimulate the economy
with lower interest rates.
   Before that, the central bank emphasized fighting inflation over
battling a recession and pushed rates up.
   Now, signaling an apparent return to a tougher anti-inflation
stance, Greenspan said ``4.5 percent (inflation) is unacceptable
... because it is very difficult in that type of environment to
prevent it from accelerating.''
   ``Inflation at this stage represents the greatest threat of
recession that we have because it will bring with it the types of
imbalances which hold us back,'' he said.
   Despite some caveats, analysts said Greenspan was clearly more
optimistic about growth than he was last July, when he told
Congress Fed policy had shifted toward avoiding ``an unnecessary
and destructive recession.''
   ``There was a greater stress on inflation and less worry about
the possibility of recession than we've heard from the Fed in the
recent past,'' said economist David Wyss of DRI@McGraw Hill Inc., a
Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
   ``I don't think it means they're going to tighten, but it does
mean they're not going to loosen right now,'' he said.
   On other matters, Greenspan said:
   _``It's difficult to say'' if an increase in inflation
expectations in the United States was causing Japanese investors to
shy away from purchasing Treasury securities sold to finance the
national debt.
   ``There is probably some element of shift'' because interest
rates in Japan have risen sharply compared with U.S. rates, he said.
   _The administration's economic forecast of 2.4 percent growth
this year and 3.2 percent growth in 1991 ``are not by any means
unreasonable.'' Private economists have accused the administration
of issuing a rosy forecast to make it easier, on paper, to trim the
budget deficit.
   Greenspan cautioned, however, that the administration's economic
forecast was conditioned on Congress passing the president's budget
proposal ``in total.''
   _Comments by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater that ``lower
rates are justified'' were ``inappropriate.'' Such statements from
the administration are better made in private, he said.

<HEAD>Conservation Group Hails Impact of Law Aimed at Soil Erosion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a few complaints about federal
enforcement, a private conservation group says historic provisions
in 1985 farm law will help farmers move rapidly toward eliminating
severe soil erosion on much of the nation's cropland by the
mid-1990s.
   A study of more than 1,000 farms in selected areas across the
nation showed the conservation provisions of the 1985 Food Security
Act have been a main force in prodding farmers into protecting soil
and water resources.
   The report, released in Washington Tuesday by the Soil and Water
Conservation Society of Ankeny, Iowa, focused on the law's
provisions governing the use of fragile, highly erodible land, and
wetland areas.
   Specific deadlines were set for farmers to comply with
Agriculture Department regulations for conservation planning and
project completion.
   The law also established a 10-year Conservation Reserve Program
with a goal of removing 40 million to 45 million acres of highly
erodible cropland from production by the end of this year. About 34
million acres have been signed.
   Under the program, farmers must plant the idled land in
protective grass or trees. In return, they get federal cost-sharing
payments to establish the soil cover, plus annual rental payments
for 10 years. Those average about $50 per acre annually.
   ``For the first time in history, receipt of most federal farm
program benefits _ commodity price supports, agricultural credit
and crop insurance _ became legally contingent on the application
of appropriate land stewardship practices by agricultural
producers,'' the report said.
   The law's four conservation parts outlined the Conservation
Reserve Program, or CRP, and so-called sodbuster, swampbuster and
compliance provisions that the report said have been generally well
accepted by farmers.
   ``We may well accomplish a greater measure of erosion control on
the nation's cropland in the next five years than we have
accomplished in the preceding 50,'' said project director Max
Schnepf.
   ``But this report makes it clear that a great deal remains to be
done by farmers and by the federal government if we are to realize
the full potential of the 1985 farm bill's conservation
provisions,'' he said.
   Schnepf said the project began in mid-1988 and the report is the
first of several planned for a three-year evaluation.
   Norman A. Berg, a member of the society's steering committee and
former head of the Soil Conservation Service in USDA, said the farm
law for the first time linked farm policies and program benefits to
sound conservation practices.
   ``The law provided leverage we did not have before to curb
erosion and protect wetlands,'' Berg said.
   Society officials said the study, which had financial support
from the Joyce Foundation of Chicago, was ``by no means a
statistically valid survey'' of all U.S. land. However, the project
did entail a close look at conservation work in 22 representative
counties.
   The report said:
   _CRP field checks show soil erosion will be reduced 91 percent
on land enrolled in the program, although the total tonnage of soil
saved may be lower than the USDA has reported.
   _Sodbuster and swampbuster provisions, with the potential loss
of federal benefits, appear ``to be discouraging farmers from
improperly cultivating fragile land and converting wetlands to crop
production.'' However, there have been violations, and ``USDA
officials are not adequately monitoring or enforcing the policies
in some areas.''
   _Conservation compliance, which requires farmers to adopt and
carry out conservation plans, will result in significant reductions
in erosion if the plans are implemented. But final implementation
``will be difficult for a significant number'' of farmers unless
they adopt additional, low-cost erosion-control practices.

   An Agriculture Department survey shows wind
damage to land in the Great Plains is down sharply from a year
ago's near-record losses that resulted from the 1988 drought.
   Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said Tuesday 1.74 million acres were reported damaged in
November and December, down almost 20 percent from 2.16 million
acres damaged in the same two months of 1988.
   Even so, the damage in November and December was nearly 60
percent above the 20-year average for those months.
   Lingering drought and limited snow cover were the major reasons
for the damage, he said. ``We've had several years of drought with
resulting lack of (crop) residue and poor vegetative cover,''
Scaling added.
   Texas, with 576,000 acres reported damaged, accounted for about
one-third of the total. North Dakota, was close behind with a state
record of almost 553,000 acres damaged by wind.
   November and December are the first two months of an annual
seven-month season when winds are highest and the soils are driest
in the Great Plains. Surveys were made in 541 counties of the
10-state region.
   In 1988-89, 14.3 million acres were damaged by wind in the Great
Plains, the most since the agency began keeping records. In
1954-55, damage was reported at nearly 16 million acres.
   According to the survey, the state-by-state breakdown comparing
damaged acres in November and December with the damage during the
same two months a year earlier, included:
   _Colorado, 65,041 acres damaged this season and 28,795 in
1988-89.
   _Kansas, 105,770 and 135,550.
   _Montana, 214,465 and 510,875.
   _Nebraska, 30,575 and 54,405.
   _New Mexico, 28,650 and 51,100.
   _North Dakota, 552,952 and 188,200.
   _Oklahoma, 57,540 and 68,480.
   _South Dakota, 54,680 and 112,250.
   _Texas, 576,320 and 664,128.
   _Wyoming, 54,595 and 346,754.

   The quality of last year's wheat crop was down
slightly from the 1988 harvest, according to an Agriculture
Department report.
   Of the 13,363 samples checked by the department's Federal Grain
Inspection Service, 56 percent were graded No. 1, compared with 64
percent in 1988, the agency said Tuesday.
   Ratings by grade are based on a number of factors, including
test weight per bushel, damaged kernels, foreign material, and
shrunken and broken kernels.

<HEAD>GAO: 14 Government Programs Ripe for Major Losses, Abuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen government programs, including
Medicare and the new agency handling the savings and loan bailout,
are high risks for fraud and abuse, a congressional report says in
warning of possible ``major losses'' of taxpayers' money.
   The General Accounting Office said Tuesday that many of the
problems have persisted for years because there is no way to force
government agencies to correct them.
   GAO provided the list to two congressional committees, saying it
decided to identify the government agencies and programs most at
risk following disclosures last year of widespread management
problems at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The
chairmen of the panels promised hearings to review the problems.
   ``I have been concerned about the possibility of other HUD-type
problems for some time and, unfortunately, I am convinced that they
do indeed exist,'' Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher said in a
letter accompanying the list.
   Bowsher warned that unless reforms are implemented, ``major
losses of federal funds and collateral fraud and abuse incidents
will continue.''
   GAO's list included:
   _The Resolution Trust Corp., the agency set up by S&amp;L bailout
legislation to handle the sale of assets of failed thrifts, worth
an estimated $200 billion to $300 billion. ``A sale of this
magnitude is unprecedented in history,'' Bowsher said. ``The desire
and potential to acquire these assets at bargain-basement prices
will make this area highly susceptible to fraud, waste and abuse.''
   _Management of seized and forfeited assets stemming from drug
and other investigations. The GAO said the two agencies that handle
these properties, the Customs Service and Marshal's Service, have
``significant internal control weaknesses'' that invite abuse.
   _Medicare. GAO said this multibillion-dollar program is riddled
with waste, saying $527 million in inappropriate payments in 1985
alone ``illustrate the magnitude of potential savings.''
   _Defense Department inventory management and purchases of major
new systems. GAO said at least $30 billion of the $100 billion in
DOD inventory was not needed and the opportunity for fraud was
plentiful as the department handles more than $900 billion in
planned purchases. ``Following established management controls to
deliver capable and supportable weapons to the user when and where
needed, and at a reasonable cost, has been the exception rather
than the rule,'' GAO said.
   Among the other areas GAO said it singled out for special
attention were the IRS' failure to collect more than $60 billion it
is owed; the management of loan and grant programs for students,
farmers and mass transit; the reliance of the Energy Department,
the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA on private
contractors; the State Department's overseas construction program
and government oversight of the $2 trillion private pension system.
   The committee chairmen, Rep. John Conyers of the House
Government Operations and Sen. John Glenn of the Senate Government
Affairs, said they hoped the Bush administration would cooperate in
determining ways to correct the problems.
   ``We simply can't afford to sit around and wring our hands over
this situation while more taxpayers' money is wasted or put at
risk,'' Glenn, D-Ohio, said in a statement. ``The real question now
is: What is being done to fix these problems?''
   Conyers, D-Mich., laid the blame for government-wide management
problems on Reagan administration deregulation policies.
   ``Ten years ago we were told by the incoming Reagan
administration that the answer to so many of our problems was `less
government,''' Conyers said. ``Today we see that the chickens have
come home to roost and the legacy of the Reagan administration's
`get the government off our backs' mentality is mismanagement,
taxpayer rip-offs and outright fraud.''

<HEAD>Cheney: Base Closure Panel Not Ruled Out</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, accused of
putting ``a political gun to the head'' of Congress with a base
closing list, says he's open to the idea of a blue-ribbon panel
studying the controversial issue.
   But Cheney, in an interview Tuesday with wire service reporters,
rejected charges from House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les
Aspin that the list was partisan and would be used to influence
lawmakers' votes on legislation.
   ``The idea that somehow I tried to put a gun to the head of
Congress is not a valid one,'' Cheney said, arguing it is Congress'
job to make the tough choice between their districts' desires and
cutting defense spending.
   ``It seems to me eminently reasonable, that if you are going to
shrink the size of the force, have fewer tanks and fewer ships, you
need fewer bases to support them,'' the secretary said.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said there was ``potential'' in Cheney's
list of more than 72 domestic facilities and 14 overseas
installations that could be closed or scaled back.
   But he objected to the way the administration wants Congress to
deal with the list and introduced legislation that would create a
bipartisan commission to make new recommendations.
   ``This is merely a list of candidates for closure,'' Aspin told
reporters at a news conference. ``The upshot is that the list can
be changed. Bases can be deleted or perhaps added. That creates
hostages for the administration. Vote against a veto override, your
base is safe. Vote to override, your base is threatened.
   ``The process is dead,'' Aspin said of Cheney's approach.
   Cheney, queried about Aspin's proposed commission, said, ``I
wouldn't rule it out completely,'' but insisted that his approach
wasn't dead either.
   ``Obviously, Congress is going to take a look at it. I'm
perfectly happy to talk to Les Aspin or anybody else,'' Cheney said.
   Aspin's suggested panel _ similar to a commission created by
Congress in 1988 _ would produce an all-or-nothing list of closings
for approval or rejection by the defense secretary and Congress.
The recommendations of the 1988 panel to close 86 bases were
adopted by Congress last year.
   Cheney, in presenting his $292.1 billion military spending plan
for fiscal 1991, proposed on Monday a list of bases for closing or
realignment that would be considered by lawmakers on an individual
basis.
   ``This puts a political gun to the head of a member with a base
in his or her district,'' Aspin said.
   The lawmaker contended the process ``opens an enormous
bargaining bazaar'' and creates ``a lot of bargaining chips for the
administration'' when time comes to influence votes.
   Aspin charged that of the 32 bases he'd looked at, 22 were in
Democratic districts, making the list clearly partisan.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a senior member of the House
Armed Services Committee, said Cheney has produced ``an unbalanced,
partisan hit list'' that is unacceptable.
   However, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., declined to
accuse the Bush administration of playing politics, saying with a
grin, ``I've heard some Republicans are very angry'' with the
selections.
   Cheney argued there may be more bases targeted in Democratic
districts because there are more Democrats in Congress and because
a large number of military installations are in
Democratic-controlled states.
   ``California gets about a third of the defense budget. ... Texas
has a large number of bases. It's really not political,'' he said.
   ``That's a petty kind of game that I don't think serves
anybody's interest. I didn't sign on as secretary of defense to get
Democrats. If I'd wanted to do that I'd have stayed in the House,''
he said.

<HEAD>Helms Wants More Answers on U.N. Anti-Torture Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Jesse Helms says he is going to work to
slow down Senate ratification of a United Nations convention
banning torture because he wants the Bush administration to provide
more information about it.
   ``There are scores of questions we need to analyze,'' said the
North Carolina senator, the ranking Republican on the Foreign
Relations Committee. ``This is such a complicated subject I hope we
don't just move it along.''
   Helms also said he was upset that only four senators _ himself,
committee chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., Larry Pressler, R-S.D.,
and Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, showed up for a hearing on the
subject Tuesday.
   Officials of the Bush administration joined human rights
activists in telling the panel they want the Senate to vote by a
two-thirds majority to ratify the convention.
   ``Early ratification of the convention by the United States will
clearly affirm our known abhorrence and condemnation or torture,''
Abraham Sofaer, the State Department's legal adviser said.
   The administration has said there is an ``urgent need'' for
Senate approval of the measure to send a signal to other countries
around the world that torture will not be tolerated.
   Sofaer said the convention will have little effect on the United
States where laws are clear, but it will give the administration a
voice in working against torture.
   Nevertheless, the administration wants to attach a few
reservations to the documents to ensure no conflict on
technicalities of U.S. law.
   Generally, the convention requires parties to prevent torture
within their territories, to make all acts of torture a political
offense and to bring those accused of torture to justice.
   Human rights activists are enthusiastic about the measure.
   ``Appropriate ratification ... will contribute significantly to
the enforcement of the international prohibition against torture in
practice,'' said Winston P. Nagan, chairman of Amnesty
International.
   Among the groups supporting the convention are the U.S. Catholic
Conference, B'nai B'rith International and the American Bar
Association.
   Although ``nobody favors torture,'' Helms said he was disturbed
that countries such as Afghanistan, Bulgaria, China and the Soviet
Union which Helms says have promoted serious human rights
violations have also ratified the convention.
   He asked if parties to the convention had condemned China for
the massacre of students last summer in Beijing. ``I guess running
over people with tanks is not torture,'' Helms said.
   Fifty-five nations have ratified the convention, including
Libya, a nation the United States has accused of promoting
terrorism. Twenty-two nations have signed the treaty, indicating
they intend to ratify it.
   The torture convention came into force on June 26, 1987. Under
the convention, a committee of 10 experts was established with
power to investigate allegations of torture and receive reports.

<TEXT>
   American officials and lawmakers just back
from the Philippines are offering a mixed assessment of President
Corazon Aquino's chances for political survival after the aborted
coup last December.
   ``The political situation remains unsettled and ... many wonder
whether the government can recover from the blow sufficiently to
restore popular confidence and make lasting strides toward
stability,'' said Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Carl W.
Ford.
   ``We are hopeful that the near loss of hard-won democracy will
energize the Philippine public and private sectors to work even
more closely and effectively,'' he told the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific on Tuesday.
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Lambertson said he
came back from Manila ``impressed again with the determination and
resilience of the government and its people.''
   But ``the danger of another coup attempt exists,'' he said.
   He said Aquino must regain confidence by eradicating corruption
and improving inefficient government services to avert another coup
attempt.
   ``Corruption remains a real problem in the Philippines and its
corrosive effects hamper government operations,'' he said.
``President Aquino is fully aware of the problem and has made
efforts to deal with it'' both by example and by exhorting her
people.
   A member of the subcommittee, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said
Congress would be unwilling to pay the price demanded by the
Philippines for extending the rights to the Clark air force and
Subic Bay naval bases once the leases expire next year.
   Leach, and the officials, suggested a growing wave of Filipino
nationalism, coupled with a decline of the Soviet military threat
and the tight U.S. budget raises doubts about the survival of the
bases.
   ``The bases are very important, but it's conceivable there are
alternatives,'' Leach said.
   ``There are alternatives,'' Ford responded. ``But they are much
more expensive.'' Ford said the United States believes it can
overcome the surge of new nationalism in the Philippines and reach
a new base agreement.
   Lambertson said negotiations would begin within several months,
initially between U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt and Filipino
Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus. A special negotiator will be
appointed for more detailed work later, he said.
   The administration witnesses also said the Aquino government is
becoming the third large recipient of U.S. foreign aid in the world
_ after Israel and Egypt.
   For the fiscal year which began Oct. 1, the administration asked
Congress for $658.6 million for the Philippines. The request
includes $200 million for the multi-year, international aid
program. The United States has pledged $1 billion for the plan over
the lifetime of the plan, for which Japan is the largest
contributor.
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Lambertson warned U.S.
law would require a cessation of U.S. aid if Aquino were overthrown.
   The ``greatest immediate threat to the government's survival''
is a faction within the military which was responsible for the
December coup attempt, Lambertson said.

   The Bush administration should re-evaluate its
military strategy and reduce U.S. forces in Europe by almost
200,000 in light of the push for freedom in the Eastern bloc, says
a former defense secretary.
   James R. Schlesinger, a past hardliner against cuts in NATO
forces, told the Senate Armed Services Committee failure to respond
to the changes with troop cuts ``would ultimately be
self-defeating.''
   ``We should plan now radically to scale back our forces in
Europe. The time for that planning is now. Implementation may
extend over months or years, as circumstances warrant. But the
reduction should not be precluded by the ongoing negotiations in
Vienna,'' Schlesinger told the panel.
   Under questioning from the committee, Schlesinger said the
United States should keep between 75,000 to 100,000 troops in
Europe, down from the current American level of about 305,000.
   Last May, prior to the full-fledged drive toward democracy in
many of the Warsaw Pact nations, President Bush proposed a ceiling
of 275,000 on U.S. and Soviet ground and air force personnel, which
would require a reduction of about 30,000 U.S. troops and about
325,000 Soviet troops.
   But Schlesinger said if the United States sticks to its current
position on reductions in negotiations in Vienna, it may fall into
the trap of ``legitimatizing the long-term presence of Soviet
forces in Eastern Europe'' which might otherwise be withdrawn.
   ``It would be far worse, if the nations of Eastern Europe were
to hold the United States or NATO responsible for the continued
presence in their countries of Soviet forces,'' Schlesinger added.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee is holding a series of
hearings on now the United States should respond to the lessening
Soviet threat and its effects on the military budget.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the panel, agreed with much of
what Schlesinger said in his testimony.
   ``The question of when we make these changes is an important one
but it seems to me that you make a case of great persuasion that
planning for these changes need to start now,'' Nunn said. ``And if
we do not start the planning now ... then we're not going to make
rationale decisions on today's budget.''
   Nunn said he had spoken to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and
stressed it will be important that Cheney spell out his vision for
defense over the next five years.
   ``Where is this budget leading us?'' said Nunn. ``I hope we're
not going to simply have a fiscal approach here. It's got to be a
reassessment of the threat and reassessment of America's response
to it.''

<HEAD>USAir Workers Reject Representation By Teamsters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 1,800 USAir workers who have been
represented by the Teamsters are no longer members of the union
after a vote by other workers for the airline.
   The Teamsters lost an organizing drive to represent 8,000
employees who load the airplanes for USAir, company and AFL-CIO
representatives said Tuesday.
   The election was an all-or-nothing event for the Teamsters, who
already represented USAir workers in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia,
Buffalo and Boston. The union's defeat means those workers no
longer are members.
   It was the Teamsters' third election at USAir since 1981 and the
largest representation election in the private sector in four
years. The union won the first two contests at USAir.
   Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO, said the two weeks
between the call for the election and the mailing of the ballots
did not give the Teamsters adequate time to campaign.
   ``I have every indication from the Teamsters that they will be
back and that they felt they were hurt in this campaign by the fast
election and all the insecurity felt these days in the
transportation industry,'' Hardesty said. ``There's fear and
concern among all workers and it makes them less willing to
organize.''
   David Shipley, spokesman for the Arlington, Va.,-based USAir,
said the Teamsters needed 4,002 votes to win the election, but only
slightly more than half that voted for the union. He said he did
not have precise figures.
   ``We felt that this particular group did not need representation
by the Teamsters. Obviously, the employees agreed with us,''
Shipley said.
   Shipley said the ballots were mailed Dec. 15 to employees
nationwide who work in 180 airports. Fleet service workers handle
baggage, cargo and load food onto airplanes.
   The ballots were counted on Tuesday.
   A call to the home of a Teamsters spokesman was unanswered.
   The Teamsters represented cargo workers at USAir before its 1989
merger with Piedmont airlines, whose employees were not members of
the union.
   On Dec. 1 the National Mediation Board ordered the election to
determine whether workers at USAir and former Piedmont employees
would be represented by the Teamsters. Three other unions
representing pilots, flight attendants and mechanics at USAir
gained the right to represent the Piedmont workers without
elections.

   The Department of Transportation is seeking to
require new school buses to display a regulation stop sign every
time the bus door opens to permit children to enter or depart.
   The department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
also proposes to improve cross-view mirrors on school buses to
provide drivers better visibility in front and along the sides of
the vehicle.
   Both proposals are subject to regulatory action.
   Jerry Ralph Curry, the agency's administrator, said Tuesday that
35 to 40 school children are killed each year in accidents related
to school buses.
   Curry said stop signals and improved mirrors could help prevent
many of those accidents when coupled with increased training for
drivers of the buses.
   More than 30 states now require a stop signal attached to school
bus doors. The safety administration's proposal would standardize
the equipment and apply in all states.
   It would consist of a stop-signal arm which would swing out from
the left side of the bus to display the standard red-and-white stop
sign.

   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher has
ordered full production of 165 new Doppler weather radars.
   The $359 million project will cover the next six years, with the
first of the new units scheduled for installation in the fall near
Oklahoma City, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
said Tuesday.
   Known as NEXRAD, for Next Generation Weather Radar, the new
system is expected to improve weather forecasts and provide earlier
warnings of severe storms, including tornados. Pre-production
versions of the radar have been under test for several months.
   Doppler radar assists meteorologists by showing the direction of
wind and rain movement on radar screens. Traditional radars can
detect the presence of storms, but cannot determine wind movements.

   Supreme Court Justice Antoni Scalia has
refused to bar the television program ``Inside Edition'' from
broadcasting scenes filmed with a hidden camera inside a New York
City doctor's office.
   He rejected without comment Tuesday an emergency request in
which Dr. Stuart M. Berger's lawyers sought to block the broadcast.
   An ``Inside Edition'' spokeswoman said the program plans to
include the scenes in a segment about Berger.
   A federal judge in Detroit ordered the program to keep the
secretly recorded scenes off the air, but a federal appeals court
panel overturned the judge's order as an unconstitutional ``prior
restraint'' of free speech.
   Berger, author of several widely sold diet books, is under
investigation by the New York State Department of Health's Office
of Professional Medical Conduct for alleged unethical and
fraudulent conduct.
   In its own investigation of Berger, the television program sent
one of its producers to the doctor's office as a patient. Producer
Amy Wasserstrom said in an affidavit she surreptitiously videotaped
two visits she made to the office.
   Ms. Wasserstrom said Berger diagnosed her as suffering from an
allergy to yeast and from chronic fatigue but another doctor told
her she had no such ailments.
   Berger's lawyers said airing the office scenes will do
irreparable harm to his reputation ``and the sanctity of his
office.''

   At fire houses, police stations, schools and
hospitals, Long Island residents still reeling from the Avianca
jetliner crash that killed 73 people and injured 86 are beginning
to help the helpers.
   Even as the dead are buried, the injured treated and the
survivors consoled, some mental health and social workers are
turning their attention to the people who rushed to the crash scene
Thursday night and found a nightmare of death, injury and
mutilation.
   In most cases, experts say, they need nothing more and nothing
less than talk.
   ``After the crash, there's an emotional aftershock,'' said Joan
Imhof, director of the Nassau County Office of Volunteer Services.
``You need to talk about the experience, what you remember, how you
felt about it, any symptoms you might be experiencing.
   ``You have to come to grips with the fact that you and your body
have suffered a traumatic experience.''
   The clinical term is post-traumatic stress disorder; symptoms
can include fatigue, nausea, muscle tremors, appetite loss,
appetite gain, poor concentration, flashbacks, anxiety and
depression.
   Ms. Imhof lives near the crash site at Cove Neck on the northern
shore of Long Island, and worked there throughout the night.
   As rescue workers carried children away from the wreckage, ``we
felt awful that we couldn't find their parents and reunite them
then,'' she recalled. ``But there were so many serious injuries, we
just had to ship them out'' to hospitals.
   Asked about efforts to comfort the rescuers, she spoke about her
own memories of the night in great detail.
   Asked if she, too, needed to talk about her experiences in order
to deal with them, she replied, ``You got it.''
   The Boeing 707 en route from Colombia ran out of fuel and
crashed on a wooded hillside Thursday night 15 miles northeast of
its destination, Kennedy International Airport.
   Helpers at the crash site were not the only ones in need.
Spanish-speaking staffers at the state's Pilgrim Psychiatric Center
in Brentwood worked for days with crash survivors and the families
of passengers at several hospitals.
   ``Emotionally, I'm still in shock,'' said Sonia
Palacio-Grottola, a social worker. ``It really hasn't sunk in yet.
We're still emotionally charged, and we need to have some peer
counseling to come down from this ordeal.''
   In addition to ``debriefing'' sessions offered by fire, police
and rescue departments for their own workers, several hospitals and
agencies are reaching out to the public.
   North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, for example, is
offering free group or individual counseling.
   Dr. Victor Fornaci, a staff psychiatrist, said it was too early
to say how many people would need help because it can take weeks or
months for symptoms to develop.
   In addition, the county Mental Health Department offered
counseling for area residents at Oyster Bay High School; at local
schools, teachers and students were discussing the crash; and the
American Red Cross planned to set up counseling sessions for rescue
workers later this week.
   ``When we're finished, we'll do some counseling. But there are
still dozens of family members that need our help,'' said Peter von
Berg of the Red Cross. ``Right now we're still on adrenaline.''
   ``We need to get our feelings out,'' he said. ``I went home
Sunday night and cried for an hour.''
   For some, the reality of Thursday night already had sunk in.
   ``We keep reliving what we did and saw,'' Oyster Bay Fire Chief
Tom Reardon said after a Sunday church service that focused on the
crash. ``What I saw that night was carnage. And we just tried to do
the best we could to help those people. Now we're trying to get
everything back to normal.''

   Scientists say they are
``delighted'' with the condition of a rescued science satellite
because the wear and tear it received during six years in space was
just what they wanted.
   ``That's why we sent it up there, to find out what happens to
materials after a long time in the space environment,'' William H.
Kinard, project chief, said Tuesday after getting his first look at
the satellite since its return.
   Wearing contamination-proof clothing and standing on an
observation platform several feet away, Kinard and other scientists
watched as the shuttle Columbia's 60-foot-long cargo bay doors
swung open to reveal the 11-ton satellite known as the Long
Duration Exposure Facility.
   Columbia's astronauts retrieved the laboratory 200 miles in
space on Jan. 12, snaring it just weeks before it probably would
have been dragged by gravity to a fiery death in the atmosphere.
   The satellite eventually will be moved to a nearby sterilized
building for close examination.
   At the Johnson Space Center in Houston, the commander of the
shuttle mission said the damage to the experiments aboard the
laboratory will provide clues to what materials best withstand the
harsh environment of space.
   ``I think it does certainly bring home the point that we have to
take a good look at anything we do over a long duration in space,''
Commander Dan Brandenstein told reporters Tuesday.
   Kinard said the laboratory appeared to have suffered a little
more wear and tear than the pictures taken by the astronauts in
space indicated.
   ``It looked a little more weathered than we concluded earlier,''
he said. ``There are lots of small micrometeoroid craters and there
are some other places where there are reactions that may have been
started my micrometeoroids.''
   He said there was some discoloration and that foil covering some
experiments had been torn.
   ``We're delighted with the condition,'' Kinard said.
   There are 57 experiments attached to the satellite's exterior,
and scientists and engineers are eager to see how the various
materials in them fared during their long exposure to atomic
oxygen, radiation, micrometeoroids and other phenomena in space.
   The results will help in designing future long-duration
spacecraft, including the Freedom manned space station to be
assembled in orbit starting in 1995.
   Four teams will study the recovered laboratory here for about
three weeks, photographing it and jotting down their observations.
The teams are composed of specialists in space debris, materials,
spacecraft systems and radiation.
   Starting in mid-February, the experiments will be covered with
protective aluminum and removed one-by-one from the satellite's
racks. They then will be delivered to scientists throughout the
nation and Western Europe for detailed study.
   The satellite carries 21 materials, coating and thermal systems
experiments, five power and propulsion experiments, 17 science
experiments and 14 optics and electronic experiments. They
represent more than 200 investigators, 33 private companies, 21
universities, seven National Aeronautics and Space Administration
centers and eight foreign countries.
   Also aboard are 12.5 million tomato seeds. A few will be planted
in research labs, but most will be sent to schools where students
from fifth grade through university level will plant, water and
nurture the seeds for research into such things as germination
rates, chromosome and genetics studies and full tomato growth.
   Kinard said the seeds will be among the first experiments
removed, so that the students have time to work with them before
the school year ends.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Reagan to Turn Over Diary Entries to Poindexter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diary entries by former President Reagan
contain ``information of significance'' for John Poindexter's
Iran-Contra trial, a federal judge says in ordering the excerpts
turned over to the defense.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene on Tuesday ordered the
former president to provide diary excerpts from more than 29
different dates by next Monday, but said he will conduct a lengthy
review process if Reagan invokes executive privilege.
   Such a step could delay the scheduled Feb. 20 start of the
trial, which already has been moved back a month due partly to
Poindexter's efforts to subpoena documents and testimony from
Reagan.
   Reagan, in Las Vegas for a speech Tuesday night, told reporters
he would not comment on the judge's order.
   Greene has not decided whether to approve a request by
Poindexter, the former national security adviser, to subpoena
Reagan as a witness. The former president is resisting such a
subpoena.
   Poindexter is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing
Congress and two counts of making false statements in connection
with aide Oliver North's assistance to the Contras and a November
1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   If Reagan invokes executive privilege, Greene said he would
``revisit the issue'' of whether the diaries are material to
Poindexter's defense. Greene noted a similar procedure was followed
during the Watergate scandal, when the special prosecutor sought
access to White House tapes in the case against several of
President Nixon's aides.
   Greene then would provide the former president and the Justice
Department with a secret document Poindexter submitted to the court
outlining why he needs the diaries.
   After court filings by all sides, the court will ``make a final
decision with respect to enforcement of the subpoena'' for the
diaries, Greene said.
   Greene said the ``vast majority'' of more than 100 diary entries
turned over to the court for review last week ``contain no
information that is material'' to the Poindexter case, but entries
covering more than 29 dates in 1985 and 1986 ``do contain
information of significance.''
   Reagan was ordered to give Poindexter a diary entry relating to
a ``successful'' trip Poindexter took in December 1985 to Central
America.
   ``The entry includes a somewhat ambiguous comment arguably
indicating that the former president knew'' of Poindexter's
``activities on behalf of the Contras,'' Greene said.
   The judge said Poindexter is entitled to diary entries in which
Reagan describes an effort to persuade the government of Honduras
to release a seized arms shipment that had been destined for the
Contras.
   Greene also said Poindexter must receive diary entries focusing
on U.S. military-type assistance to an unidentified Central
American country that may have been used in support of the Contras.
   The entries ``may show what types of aid President Reagan
thought could legally be provided for the military or paramilitary
operations of the Contras,'' Greene said.
   Poindexter also is entitled to Reagan's diary entries concerning
meetings with Poindexter and others in December 1985 ``to discuss
the sales of arms to Iran,'' Green said, adding that one entry
``addresses briefly the issue of the proceeds from these sales.''
   Greene said none of the diary entries shed ``any light on the
question of what President Reagan may have known about the
diversion'' of proceeds to the Contras from the administration's
secret sale of arms to Iran.
   Reagan has denied knowing about the diversion and Poindexter
testified before Congress that he didn't tell the president.
   Poindexter contends Reagan knew of and approved activities
undertaken in the Iran and Contra initiatives and that therefore
Poindexter had no reason to conceal these activities from Congress,
as charged in the indictment.

<HEAD>US Sanctions On Libya Complicate War on African Pest</HEAD>

   The Bush adminstration's refusal to deal with Libya
is complicating an international campaign to rid Africa of a deadly
pest that threatens livestock, wildlife and even humans.
   The parasitic screw-worm fly is proving to be a ``political
insect,'' said a source at the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization. ``The United States has the expertise and Libya has
the pest.''
   So far, Washington has agreed to allow critically needed U.S.
technology to be used in Libya to combat the insect. But U.S.
sanctions against Libya mean the technology can't be quickly
authorized, and crucial months have passed.
   Also, the United States has refused a request by the U.N.
organization to allow Americans with vitally needed experience go
to Libya to help eradicate the insect.
   ``We would have been able to have the (full-scale eradication)
campaign under way if it weren't for the obstacles'' from the U.S.
side, said the FAO source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The screw-worm fly lodges in wounds or tick bites and can kill
its hosts, including humans, by eating away at tissues. In addition
to livestock, wildlife such as zebras and antelopes as well as some
endangered species are threatened.
   A small but undetermined number of people in Libya have been
infested with the parasite.
   Time is crucial to containing the fly, which, until its
appearance in Libya, had not been seen outside the Western
Hemisphere.
   Earlier this month, President Bush renewed sanctions against
Libya. The ban on U.S. travel to Libya and economic dealings dates
back to the administration of Ronald Reagan, who accused Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi of sponsoring international terrorism.
   A U.S. official who declined to be identified said the United
States agreed to help with the screw-worm fly after ``we received
assurances no resources would be given directly to the government''
of Gadhafi.
   The United States is cooperating because the insect's threat
goes beyond Libya.
   Experts say the infestation could suddenly spread to Libya's
neighbors, especially Tunisia and Egypt, then move down the Nile
River Valley into Central Africa. Southern Europe also is
considered vulnerable.
   If the pest moves beyond Libya, said U.N. official Bjorn
Sigurbjornsson, ``We may not be able to eradicate the fly from
Africa at all.''
   The U.S. technology consists of a special way of irradiating
flies to make them sterile. Under the strategy, tens of millions of
flies would be sterilized at a specially outfitted U.S.-Mexican
laboratory in Mexico and released in Libya. Matings would
eventually cause the insect to die out.
   The United States became the unquestioned expert on screw-worm
flies after years of devastating infestation in the U.S. Southwest.
In 1982, the insect was declared wiped out in the United States.
   Thanks mainly to two relatively cold winters, the warmth-loving
fly has been contained to a swath across northern Libya, east and
west of Tripoli, said Edgar Yates, a technical expert at the
International Fund for Agricultural Development, another Rome-based
international agency.
   Yates said the screw-worm fly probably came to Libya through an
infected animal from Latin America, where the pest is still a
problem.
   FAO's request to the United States was made last May, about a
year after the fly was confirmed in Libya, the FAO source said.
   In January, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter asked
the Senate to amend a treaty, which the United States signed with
Mexico, that currently allows the sterilization flies to be
dispersed only in the Americas.
   Approval is expected in March, said Paula Henstridge of the
deparment's legislative department.
   The earliest the flies could be released would be early autumn,
Yates said. So far, the United States has been unbending on letting
American technicians go to Libya. ``As far as we're concerned, the
Mexican expertise is sufficient,'' said Elizabeth Bonkowsky of the
U.S. State Department.
   Sigurbjornsson disagrees, saying U.S. technicians will be
essential when the full-scale fly release, scheduled to last up to
two years, is under way.
   The U.S. government has cooperated in other ways. Larval samples
have been analyzed in a North Dakota facility, and Ms. Bonkowsky
said a Libyan was granted a visa to work with U.S. experts there.
   There are also problems between the FAO and the United States.
The United States has refused to pay its full assessment, which
accounts for one-quarter of the agency's budget.
   The dispute goes back to 1985, when Reagan accused the
organization of being biased against the United States and of
inefficient administration.

   The first U.S. band to march in the Soviet
Union's annual May Day parade promises to march through Red Square
to the stirring strains of ``God Bless America.''
   Dorothy Hill, who has headed the Waltham American Legion band
for more than 40 years, said Monday it took her three years to win
permission for the band's participation in the Red Square
festivities.
   A Soviet immigrant in Brookline eased the way for the
Massacusetts marchers. Rudolph Peselman, who works as an
international trader, helped arrange the nine-day trip for 150
people, including Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn and more than 70 band
members.
   Hill said she hoped the April 28-May 6 trip will promote world
peace.
   ``I'm a veteran of World War II. I've seen three wars. I don't
want to see any more,'' she said. ``I know I'm going to be playing
`God Bless America' going through Red Square.''

   City officials are hoping that a good
tree trimming will do what inflatable snakes, poison corn,
Christmas lights and a sticky limb coating couldn't _ keep pesky
birds out of the pear trees.
   Stillwater's concern about the trees runs deep.
   City Manager Carl Weinaug said the community has spent thousands
of dollars during the past four years to make the birds feel
unwelcome.
   The city commission approved the pruning in hopes of reducing
the roosts and rousting the flocks of grackles, English sparrows
and other birds that seek refuge in the 47 pear trees.
   Winfrey Houston of a downtown merchants group proposed the trees
be trimmed significantly to make them unattractive to the pear
pests.
   Although the trees may be unattractive to people for a short
time, he said that was a better alternative than to get rid of the
trees.
   The trees' height will be slashed nearly in half, to about 12
feet.
   The board also voted to place netting on some of the trees and
to test dwarf pear trees.

   Some restaurants in northwest Montana no
longer automatically plop a slice of tomato onto their burgers.
   The reason? The tomatoes cost more than the hamburger.
   Tim Dutter, manager of the Kalispell Dairy Queen, says he now
pays $1.49 a pound for hamburger and $2 a pound for tomatoes.
   Dairy Queen has not changed its policy on tomatoes, however,
because customers have routinely paid a nickel extra for a slice of
tomato.
   ``We don't raise the price of the hamburger to cover the cost of
the tomato,'' he explained. Just the same, Dutter said, ``we're
taking somewhat of a loss'' on tomatoes at the moment.
   At Wendy's in Kalispell, tomatoes have become ``a request item
only,'' according to assistant manager Virginia Neuhausen.
   With large tomatoes costing 62 cents apiece _ compared with 10
or 11 cents normally _ nobody gets one without asking. The policy
has prompted no complaints, Neuhausen said.
   The price rise was triggered by an unusual freeze in the South
earlier this winter, according to Ron Vivit, produce manager at
Rosauer's supermarket in Kalispell.
   In area food stores, tomatoes are selling at $2.39-$2.59 a pound
_ but they're not selling quickly.

<HEAD>Nation's Oldest Known Flight Attendant Retires at 70</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman believed to be the nation's oldest flight
attendant has retired at age 70 after logging nearly 4{ years in
the air during a career that began in 1948.
   ``I had to have a goal for something and I figured it might as
well be old,'' Connie Walker said Tuesday after she stepped off a
Northwest Airlines flight from Seoul.
   With a sparkle in her eye that might have been a tear, she said
her feelings were torn.
   ``The body is ready to quit and the heart wants to keep going,''
she said.
   Walker, her union and company representatives said that as far
as they were aware, she was the nation's oldest flight attendant.
   About three dozen friends and co-workers greeted Walker at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport with flowers, balloons, hugs
and a chorus of ``For she's a good lady.''
   Among the well-wishers was Denise Flanagan, who Walker helped
deliver on a flight to Anchorage 36 years ago. Northwest flew
Flanagan from her home in Ludlow, Mass., and her mother, Lorraine
Magenau, from Akron, Ohio, to help Walker celebrate her retirement.
   They have remained in touch and Walker, who never married, calls
Flanagan her daughter.
   ``We're unofficial family _ love, not blood,'' Flanagan said.
   Magenau said it may have been anxiety that brought on the labor
during the flight. When Walker came to help, Magenau remembers her
saying, ``I don't know anything about babies, but I'll do what I
can.''
   Walker started at age 28 in 1948, flying between Portland, Ore.,
and Billings, Mont. She has spent nearly 4{ years of her life in
the air, and her mileage is the equivalent of about 700 trips
around the Earth, the airline estimated.
   Walker said her next trip will be a vacation cruise ``so I don't
have to go in and out of an airport and stand in line.''
   She plans a flight to Norway in December, but said sitting down
will be a new experience.
   ``Like an old warhorse you want to get up and help,'' she said.
   Cindy Yeast, of the Association of Flight Attendants in
Washington, D.C., said it is common for attendants to work into
their 60s, but 70 is the oldest she has heard of. Bill Rainey, with
Teamsters Local 2707, which represents 6,500 flight attendants,
said he knows of none older.
   Northwest has no age limit for flight attendants, said
spokeswoman Karen Jollie.
   Walker never showed her age, her co-workers said.
   ``She's an amazing gal,'' said Bob Ryan, who was first officer
on her last flight. ``It's hard to believe that at 70 she has the
spark and drive she has. It's really great.''

   Commuters in Seoul were shoved into
jammed subway cars for the first time today by pushers hired by
subway authorities to prevent rush-hour delays.
   The new workers, dubbed ``pushmen,'' helped commuters at some
busy subway stations push their way into already crowded cars.
   Subway officials said 132 students were deployed at 20 crowded
stations to quicken the operation of subway trains, which had been
delayed at some stations by commuters clustered around doors,
struggling to get inside.
   One pusher, Cho Un-sang, identified himself as a college student
and said he was asked to work for three hours in the morning for $2
an hour.
   About 3 million riders a day use the four subway lines in Seoul,
a city of 10 million people, with about 1 million traveling during

   Portable computer owners will be able to tap
into central computers from almost anywhere, without using
telephone lines, through a nationwide radio network being developed
by IBM and Motorola Inc.
   ``We're giving the mobile worker access to data he's never had
before,'' said Jack Blumenstein, an International Business Machine
Corp. executive who was named president of the joint venture,
called Ardis.
   Motorola had offered a similar service to clients in New York,
Chicago and Los Angeles and had designed a nationwide in-house
system for IBM service technicians. The companies said Tuesday they
decided to combine the networks to get a payback from hundreds of
millions of invested dollars.
   For Motorola, it provides a national radio network to market to
new clients. Ardis officials said Sears, Roebuck and Co. and New
York Life Insurance Co. are among major companies testing the
system.
   Potential users include field service personnel such as
equipment maintenance technicians, real estate brokers,
package-delivery workers, police officers and insurance agents.
   By using a hand-held terminal hooked to the radio network, a
mobile home appliance repairman could be told by his headquarters
what service calls to make, and in turn could check on the
availability of parts from his company's warehouse.
   The service, which will be available in April, would appear to
be in competition with cellular telephones. By using cellular
phones and a modem, a portable computer can be hooked up to a
mainframe computer.
   But IBM and Motorola say their system is more useful because it
is on line all the time _ there's no need to dial up a computer. In
addition, they say, it provides the ability to store and recall
messages that are sent to the terminal when the user is not
monitoring it. Cellular phones have difficulty penetrating
buildings made of certain materials, but the computer system would
have no such problems, the companies said.
   IBM and Motorola would not disclose the amount they are
investing in the 50-50 partnership, based in the Chicago suburb of
Lincolnshire, Ill.
   Exact pricing of the service has not been set, but it is
expected to cost about $100 to $150 a month per terminal.

<HEAD>Doctors Claim First Successful Fetal Heart Surgery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors at a London hospital say they have carried
out what they believe is the first successful fetal heart surgery.
   Dr. Lindsey Allan of the fetal cardiology unit at Guy's Hospital
said Tuesday that doctors had corrected a heart valve defect in an
unborn boy using a balloon catheter.
   ``As far as I know this is the first successful operation of its
kind,'' she said.
   Two operations were carried out on the fetus during the mother's
pregnancy in December, one at 31 weeks and the second at 33 weeks,
she said. She did not say why there had been a delay in disclosing
the details.
   Allan said the baby was born prematurely on Jan. 4 _ one week
after the second operation _ and underwent surgery for the third
time a few hours after birth.
   ``The child is still quite seriously ill, but we have given him
a chance he would not otherwise have had,'' Allan said. She said
the parents, who do not want to be identified, live outside London.
   Most fetuses with the rare defect, called critical aortic
stenosis, die in the womb, and few who are born survive for more
than 24 hours, she said. The defect blocks the aortic valve, making
it unable to pump blood at the right pressure, leading to heart
failure.
   The operations involved inserting a catheter down a hollow
needle directly into the chest wall and heart of the fetus. Once in
place, the balloon was dilated to open the heart valve, the doctors
said.
   A catheter is a slender flexible tube inserted into a body
passage, vessel or cavity. Its normal uses include passing fluids
and making examinations.
   Allan said the team that pioneered the technique included
herself; Michael Tynan, professor of pediatric cardiology; and
Darryl Maxwell, director of the hospital's fetal medicine unit.
   She said there were always ethical obstacles to this type of
operation.
   ``I am not sure that we should be meddling sometimes. There is
always discussion as to whether it is a reasonable request to make
of the mother. On the other hand, one knows that the alternative is
almost universally fatal,'' she said.
   In the operation, a hollow needle measuring 0.04 of an inch in
diameter and about 10 inches long was inserted through the mother's
abdomen and uterine wall directly into the chest and heart of the
fetus.
   Using a high resolution ultrasonic scanner, Maxwell guided the
needle into the heart through the left ventricle.
   The catheter was then passed down the needle. Attached to it was
the deflated balloon and a piece of platinum wire.
   The pumping action of the heart took the wire and the balloon
directly across the aortic valve. The balloon was then inflated by
pumping saline solution down the tube. When inflated, the balloon
tore and split the valve to improve the blood flow.
   The Dec. 18 attempt failed because of difficulty in positioning
the device across the aortic valve. The balloon burst when inflated
and snapped off the catheter while being removed.
   The remains of the Dec. 18 balloon are still in the baby's
heart, Maxwell said. He said an operation to remove it was too
risky. ``Leaving it there does not seem to have caused any
problems,'' he said.
   The Dec. 28 operation went more smoothly because less fluid was
pumped into the balloon. Maxwell said the needle was in the heart
for about 30 minutes during the two-hour procedure.
   The mother, who also has two daughters, was awake during the
operations, the doctors said. Only local anaesthetic was
administered to her abdominal wall to ensure the fetus was awake
and in the right position.
   The mother was allowed to go home after the Dec. 28 operation,
and a week later she went into premature labor. Her son was born
six weeks early by normal delivery and within hours was taken to
Guy's, where the third operation was performed to make sure the
valve had been properly opened.
   Guy's Hospital is part of Britain's state-run National Health
Service.

   Two women were convicted of forcing each
other's children, ages 11 and 9, to have sex under the threat of
beatings while the women watched.
   The Circuit Court jury found Carolyn Wilson and Annette Sanford
guilty of two counts each of first-degree criminal sexual conduct
on Tuesday. The women could face life imprisonment when they are
sentenced in March.
   Wilson, 42, and Sanford, 34, will face additional charges in the
spring from an episode in which they allegedly lined up their six
children and allowed men to choose among them for sex. The two
women's families lived together between 1984-88.
   Wilson's son, now 13, and Sanford's daughter, now 11, testified
that Wilson ordered them to have sexual intercourse in May 1988.
   Authorities say some of the children had told of being raped and
molested over a two- to three-year period by men visiting the women.
   The women denied the charges.
   The children were placed in foster care homes in 1988.

   County supervisors voted to ask the state
Attorney General's office to review the McMartin preschool
molestation trial as prosecutors considered refiling charges
against Raymond Buckey.
   Buckey, 31, and his 63-year-old mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey,
were acquitted Jan. 18 of 52 child molestation counts at the
now-defunct McMartin Pre-School in suburban Manhattan Beach.
   A mistrial was declared on 13 other counts against Buckey when
jurors could not reach a verdict.
   Prosecutors were expected to announce today whether they would
refile those charges.
   Parents of children involved in the nation's longest and
costliest criminal proceeding cheered a vote Tuesday by Los Angeles
County supervisors to ask the state Attorney General's office to
review the 6-year-old case.
   State officials were asked to review trial transcripts and
comments some jurors reportedly made afterward that they felt
molestations might have occurred but that the prosecution failed to
prove its case against the defendants.
   The county's call for a state investigation would be dropped if
the charges were refiled, said Supervisor Michael Antonovich,
author of the motion.
   At a news conference Tuesday, victims' rights activists called
for a new trial.
   ``Child sexual abuse is no longer taboo in this country, but an
epidemic. And it's an epidemic we do have a cure for,'' said Lynne
Lamb Bryant of the group Victims of Incest Can Emerge Survivors in
Action.
   Doreen Kinney of Families of Crimes of Silence said her group
had received 6,000 letters demanding that Buckey be retried.
   ``We believe those people ... are trying to tell us that no one
has a right to hurt the children,'' she said.
   Douglas Wolf of the Adam Walsh Child Resource Center said his
group supports a bill that will be introduced in the Legislature
that would lift the statute of limitations on prosecuting child
molesters. He declined to discuss the bill in detail or name its
sponsors, however.

   Ricardo ``Ricky'' Bordallo, former governor
of Guam, died Wednesday of self-inflicted gunshot wounds while
draped in a Guam national flag and chained to a statue in a busy
intersection.
   Bordallo, pronounced dead at Naval Hospital 4:28 p.m., was to
have boarded a plane Wednesday night for Los Angeles. He was to
report to the federal correctional facility in Boron, Calif., on
Friday, where he was to begin serving a four-year prison term on
witness tampering and obstruction charges.
   Bordallo died of massive brain damage, said a hospital spokesman.
   Doctors had worked furiously to save his life, but emergency
surgery failed.
   Bordallo, 63, shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol after
chaining himself to a statue of Chief Quipuha at one of the capital
city's busiest intersections, said police Lt. Phil Dennis.
   He had unveiled four placards, one of which said, ``I regret
that I have only one life to give to my island,'' said Dennis. Also
recovered at the scene were a blood-stained flag and a padlock and
chain.
   Bordallo had served a governor of the U.S. territory from
1976-80, and was re-elected again in 1984.
   ``It's a very sad day for me personally ... he was a close
personal friend during the early part of our lives,'' said Ben
Blaz, Guam Republican congressional delegate, reached at his
Washington, D.C., office. ``I didn't think this would happen. Ricky
Bordallo always seemed to bounce back from his many adversities.''
   His wife, territorial senator Madeleine Bordallo, was said to
have been with her husband when he took his life.

   Chinese authorities have recently allowed a
large number of imprisoned pro-democracy activists to receive
visits from their relatives, a pro-Beijing newspaper reported today.
   Wang Dan, the movement's top student leader, and Liu Xiaobo, a
teacher and one of the last hunger strikers, were among those
visited, according to the Chinese-language Wen Wei Po.
   The paper quoted unidentified sources as saying both Wang and
Liu were in relatively good health and spirits. Liu has been
incarcerated since June.
   On June 4, Liu and three other hunger strikers led several
thousand students from Tiananmen Square after soldiers killed
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of pro-democracy protesters in other
parts of Beijing.
   Wang, a history student at Beijing University, went into hiding
after the protests but was arrested, apparently during the summer,
when a reporter from Taiwan unwittingly led police to him.
   The paper said the visits, which began shortly before Saturday,
the Chinese new year, were the most allowed since the June 4
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   The pro-Communist paper said the decision to allow the visits
was made in tandem with the ending of martial law in Beijing. It
said both moves indicate that China's political situation is
``daily becoming more stable.''
   China said recently it had freed 573 people arrested for taking
part in the crushed pro-democracy movement. But thousands more
reportedly remain jailed in Beijing alone.
   The article did not say how many of these people were granted
the right to see their family, saying only that people identified
as ``intellectuals and academics'' were allowed visits.

<TEXT>
   A banker charged with hiding illegal drug
profits in a $32 million money-laundering case says he was tricked
by federal agents and now faces guilt by association to his former
customer _ Manuel Noriega.
   Amjad Awan, who once claimed to control Noriega's secret
accounts, is charged along with four other officers of the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International and a Colombian with laundering
cash they knew to be drug proceeds.
   In opening arguments Tuesday, prosecutors wove an account of how
undercover agents infiltrated a Colombian drug lord's operation,
picked up cocaine profits from U.S. middlemen and went to the
bankers to help hide the source of the cash.
   ``It's easy after the fact to look back and second-guess,''
countered Awan's attorney, John P. Hume. ``But it's standard
practice: Bankers never ask where the money comes from. It
embarrasses customers and drives people away.''
   Hume said Robert Musella, who was actually a Customs agent
posing as a high-stakes launderer, never had a deal with the
bankers to launder drug cash.
   ``He never said he was engaged in criminal conduct. He never
gave Awan an opportunity to get in or to get out,'' Hume said.
   Although Awan testified before a U.S. Senate panel in 1988 that
he once handled $23 million in Noriega's accounts, the defense
attorney also warned the government to keep the deposed Panamanian
leader out of the case.
   ``This is guilt by association. By focusing in on Panama and
General Noriega, they're causing you not to focus in on the
problems of the transactions,'' Hume told jurors.
   The other defendants are Colombian Rudolf Armbrect of Medellin;
Syed Aftab Hussain, who was operations officer of the
Luxembourg-based bank in Panama; Akbar A. Bilgrami of Miami, a
director of the Latin American Division; Sibte Hassan, who was an
officer with the Paris branch; and Ian Howard, French country
manager based in Paris.
   They are accused of conspiracy to traffic in drugs, conspiracy
to launder drug profits and money laundering.
   Prosecutors said the bankers proposed a scheme in which millions
in drug profits were converted into certificates of deposit at the
bank's Panama City branch, and then used as collateral for loans
that gave drug barons a source of cash.
   Undercover agents recorded 148 meetings and more than 2,000
telephone calls that prosecutors said will show the defendants were
aware they were handling drug money.
   ``It was a policy of the bank to take in as many deposits as you
can as fast as you can and don't be too careful about where it
comes from,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Rubenstein said.
   ``My clients are the biggest drug dealers in Colombia,'' the
prosecutor quoted the undercover agent as telling Awan.
   ``It's not any business of mine who the customers are,'' Awan
replied, according to Rubinstein.
   Rubenstein said the bankers were motivated by ambition.
   ``Their career goals,'' he said, ``were more important than the
laws of any country.''
   Before the start of jury selection two weeks ago, two divisions
of the Luxembourg bank, one of the world's largest private
financial institutions, pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges.
   As part of a plea bargain, the bank agreed to forfeit a record
$14 million in assets frozen earlier by the government and to
cooperate against other defendants.

   Woody Allen, Rob Reiner, Phil
Alden Robinson, Oliver Stone and Peter Weir are the Directors Guild
of America's nominees for 1989 directorial achievement.
   Allen was nominated for ``Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' Reiner for
``When Harry Met Sally ... ,'' Robinson for ``Field of Dreams,''
Stone for ``Born of the Fourth of July'' and Weir for ``Dead Poets
Society.''
   ``I'm just stunned,'' said Robinson, a first-time nominee. ``I
didn't think I stood a chance.''
   ``I think we have some interesting choices this year,''
commented Barry Levinson, last year's winner for ``Rain Man,'' as
he announced the nominees Tuesday.
   Reiner, Robinson and Weir were somewhat surprising choices,
since several critics have overlooked their achievements in favor
of such films as Paul Mazursky's ``Enemies, A Love Story,'' Edward
Zwick's ``Glory,'' Bruce Beresford's ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and
Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing.''
   Said Robinson: ``Bruce Beresford deserved a nomination. I'm
surprised Ed Zwick didn't get a nomination. And a lot of people
were pulling for Paul Mazursky.''
   ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' is an alternately funny and haunting
story of infidelity, starring Allen, Alan Alda and Anjelica Huston.
``When Harry Met Sally ...'' is perhaps the lightest movie in
competition, a romantic comedy with Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as
best friends who become lovers.
   ``Field of Dreams,'' set in an Iowa corn field, features Kevin
Costner as a baseball fan who recaptures the past by building a
ballpark on his farm. ``Born on the Fourth of July'' is Stone's
account of the life of Ron Kovic (played by Tom Cruise), a
patriotic soldier whose life is shattered in Vietnam.
   ``Dead Poets Society'' casts Robin Williams as an unconventional
teacher working within the confines of a conventional boys boarding
school.
   The guild says its awards have deviated from the Academy Awards
only three times since 1949.
   Three years ago, Steven Spielberg won the DGA award for ``The
Color Purple,'' but Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
members didn't nominate him for an Oscar. The directing Oscar that
year went to Sydney Pollack for ``Out of Africa.''
   Some observers believe the guild's 9,000 members, all of whom
have a vote, represent a more divergent electorate than the Academy.
   Four of the 1989 nominees have been up for the DGA award before.
Allen was nominated for ``Annie Hall'' (1977), ``Manhattan'' (1979)
and ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986); Reiner for ``Stand By Me''
(1986); Stone for ``Platoon'' (He won in 1986); and Weir for
``Witness'' (1985).
   The awards will be presented at the DGA's 42nd annual dinner, to
be held simultaneously in New York and Los Angeles on March 10.

   Some potential jurors in the criminal
trial of former Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood say they
already have made up their minds or could lose their jobs if picked
for the jury.
   The Exxon Valdez rammed a charted reef March 24 and dumped more
than 10 million gallons of crude into Prince William Sound in the
nation's worst oil spill.
   Ten of the 91-member jury pool were questioned Tuesday. Four
were excused.
   Two people said they might lose their jobs if forced to serve on
a trial expected to run six to eight weeks. The other two said they
had made up their minds about who was responsible for the spill.
   ``This would be a tough one for me,'' one of the prospective
jurors, a heavy equipment operator, told the court. ``A lot of
damage has been done.''
   Another, who said he had caused a 10,000-gallon spill himself
while working for the oil industry in Alaska, told lawyers
Hazelwood should not have been charged.
   Hazelwood, 43, is being tried on one felony charge of criminal
mischief and misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment,
negligent discharge of oil and operating on a vessel while
intoxicated.
   The maximum possible penalty for conviction on all counts is
seven years, three months in prison and a $61,000 fine.
   The tanker hit Bligh Reef a few hours after taking on a load of
North Slope crude oil at the trans-Alaska pipeline terminal at
Valdez.
   Oil released by the huge gashes in its hull coated hundreds of
miles of shoreline, killed thousands of marine mammals and prompted
what Exxon said was a $2 billion cleanup involving thousands of
workers.
   The trial began Monday, with Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone
rejecting another round of defense efforts to get charges against
the veteran seaman dismissed.
   Defense attorney Dick Madson had argued that charges should be
dismissed because the state lacks jurisdiction.
   Alcohol abuse, command responsibilities and pretrial publicity
are figuring heavily in jury selection.
   ``Have you formed any opinions of roles or responsibilities of
the various parties?'' Madson repeatedly asked.
   Despite excusing four potential jurors, Johnstone kept the
process moving. He pushed lawyers from both sides to speed their
examinations.
   ``It's going much faster than I expected,'' said Madson, who
complained the judge was limiting questioning.
   Asked if 12 jurors could be seated by Friday, he replied: ``If
he keeps cutting off questions like he is, yes.''

<TEXT>
   Gov. Jim Florio accused Exxon Corp. of lax
handling of a 570,000-gallon oil spill in a bird and fish
sanctuary, and said the state had learned from the Exxon Valdez
spill not to trust the company.
   Exxon, responding to Florio's comments Tuesday, defended its
response to the Jan. 2 spill _ and to the Valdez disaster _ and
said it would fulfill its responsibilities for the cleanup.
   Florio said the state Department of Environmental Protection has
determined that a pipeline operator and supervisor on duty at the
time of the spill in the Arthur Kill lacked the certification
required by New York authorities, which shares jurisdiction for the
waterway.
   A portion of pipe will be pulled out of the waterway, which lies
between New Jersey and the New York City borough of Staten Island,
and transported to Ohio for lab tests that could help determine the
cause of the spill, Florio said. Exxon confirmed it was removing
the pipe today for tests at its expense.
   Florio, the Democrat elected governor last year after a strong
pro-environment campaign, said New York and New Jersey authorities
had mapped out a strategy to restore the important East Coast
spawning ground for birds and fish, which scientists say absorbed
serious damage from the spilled heating oil.
   No dollar figure has been assigned to the damage, nor have
cleanup costs been established.
   ``I want to make it clear to everyone in New Jersey that this
will not be another Valdez,'' Florio said, referring to the March
28 wreck that spilled more than 10 million gallons of oil into
Alaska's Prince William Sound. ``Exxon will not be allowed to hit
and run. ...
   ``My impression of what's happening in Valdez is that Exxon
seems to be inclined to wipe its hands sooner rather than later,''
Florio said. ``We're not going to allow that approach to be
duplicated here.''
   Exxon spokesman Leo McLean defended Exxon's cleanup in Alaska
and said the company was cooperating with authorities to ``assess
potential impacts ... and work toward agreement'' on the Arthur
Kill cleanup.
   Florio reiterated claims that pipeline operators ignored
warnings of a possible leak. Exxon has attributed the slow
detection of the pipeline's problems to equipment failure, rather
than human error.
   Florio said James Fitzgerald, a console operator at Exxon's
Bayway refinery, had not obtained the certification required of
pipeline operators by the New York Fire Department.
   George Leth, the shift supervisor who trained Fitzgerald, also
was not certified to operate the equipment, Florio said.
   The lack of certification ``was another piece of information we
will factor into the on-going investigation the attorney general is
conducting,'' Florio said.
   McLean said he could not confirm or deny the certification claim
until the company completed its own investigation.

<HEAD>Scientists Say `Killer Bees' May Arrive This Spring</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the Africanized ``killer bees''
swarm ever closer to their long-awaited U.S. border crossing,
scientists are meeting to develop a strategy for battling the
invasion, which may occur by the spring.
   The bees were sighted recently at Soto la Marina, Mexico, about
150 miles south of the border city of Brownsville, said Anita
Collins, bee reseach leader for the local Agricultural Research
Service station.
   Scientists from the research service, the Department of
Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the
Texas A&amp;M Agricultural Experiment Station attended a bee strategy
meeting Tuesday.
   ``We are trying to draft specific plans for who is going to do
what and when, and how, when we start seeing bees coming across the
border,'' Collins said. ``And the idea is to protect the public and
the bee industry in Texas.''
   There is no reason to panic, Collins said.
   ``It is not a black cloud about to descend on South Texas,'' she
said. ``This is the natural spread of a population in small groups
of bees called swarms.''
   The ``killer bees'' buzz off when sprayed with insect repellent,
and if no repellent is available, ``the best advice is to run,
because you can outrun a bee,'' Collins said.
   The bees, a hybrid of the European honeybee and the pure African
queen bee, gained the ``killer'' label not because their sting is
more poisonous than the European bees, but because of their
defensive behavior, in which hundreds or thousands of the bees
attack intruders.
   Twenty-six Africanized queen bees that escaped a research center
in Brazil in 1957 are to blame for the swarms that have crept
steadily northward through Central American and Mexico.
   The bees spread at the rate of 200-300 miles annually, according
to research by John Thomas, a Texas A&amp;M extension entomologist.
   Texas A&amp;M sought $690,000 for a control program to slow the bee
spread but the state legislature turned down the request last year,
said Fred Meyer of the U.S. Agriculture Department.
   Once the bees arrive, Meyer said, funds should be available to
eradicate the hives of the Africanized bees, survey the areas where
they are found, and quarantine bees in affected areas.
   Several swarms of Africanized bees that arrived on ships from
Latin America already have been found at seaports in the United
States.

   A former governor of Guam facing the start of
a four-year prison term shot himself to death today while draped
Guam's national flag and chained to a statue in a busy intersection.
   Ricardo ``Ricky'' Bordallo, 63, shot himself in the head. In
addition to being wrapped in the flag, he had set up four placards,
one of which said: ``I regret that I only have one life to give to
my island,'' according to police and witnesses.
   Bordallo shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol after chaining
himself to a statue of Chief Quipuha, who was the first chief in
Guam to adopt Christianity. He died of massive brain damage at 4:28
p.m., said a spokesman at Naval Hospital.
   Bordallo had been scheduled to fly tonight to Los Angeles, where
he was to visit with his daughter. On Friday, he was due at the
federal correctional facility in Boron, Calif., to begin a
four-year prison term on witness tampering and obstruction charges.
   Bordallo was convicted in February 1987 of getting engineer
Johnny Carpio to lie to federal officials about a $60,000 political
contribution from a group of Japanese businessmen.
   According to trial testimony, Bordallo, a Democrat, admitted
accepting the money from the businessmen, but said the money was a
campaign contribution.
   Carpio was convicted in 1987 of extortion and bribery and placed
on five years' probation.
   Bordallo had served as governor of the U.S. territory from
1976-80, and was re-elected in 1984. He lost a re-election bid in
1988 to Republican Joseph Ada.
   ``My own instincts make me believe that I will not be coming
back from Boron alive,'' Bordallo said Friday in an interview with
the Pacific Daily News. ``I'm not dwelling on how it will happen. I
will be in the hands of people who are masters of intrigue.''
   Reporters who attended a farewell party for Bordallo earlier in
the day said he appeared to be in good spirits.
   The party was in the office of his wife, territorial Sen.
Madeleine Bordallo, who is considering a run for governor this year.
   ``It's a very sad day for me personally ... he was a close
personal friend during the early part of our lives,'' Guam's
congressional delegate, Ben Blaz, said from Washington, D.C.
   ``I didn't think this would happen. Ricky Bordallo always seemed
to bounce back from his many adversities.''

   A group of teen-agers shot two deaf brothers,
killing one, after shouting at the men during an apparent traffic
dispute, police said.
   The victims could communicate only with sign language, and ``it
is unlikely that they understood what was being said or what was
happening,'' police Lt. Harvie Eubank said. ``It was just a
senseless shooting.''
   Cesar Vieira, 30, an unemployed carpenter and father of two
whose wife is expecting a third child, died at a hospital Monday
from chest wounds. Edward Vieira, 25, an unemployed auto mechanic
and father of a young son, was treated for hip and shoulder wounds
and released after the attack Sunday night.
   No arrests had been made Tuesday.
   ``It's like their handicap got them shot. People didn't
understand them so they shot them,'' said brother Marco Vieira, 29.
   The two victims had visited their mother and brother and were
heading home on a motorcycle when the shooting occurred, police
said.
   At a traffic light, the brothers noticed that five young men in
a car were gesturing and yelling. When the light turned green, the
car followed, forcing the two into a parking lot where, after
shouting, one of the passengers opened fire.
   ``We can only surmise that they possibly had some kind of
traffic dispute,'' said police Lt. L.A. Durrer. ``But the brother
who survived doesn't have any idea what they did wrong that could
have caused it.''
   Deaf since childhood, the brothers and their families shared a
house in Palmdale, 60 miles north of Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Inmates Escape Santiago Cell after Digging Tunnel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-three leftist guerrillas, some of
whom tried to kill President Augusto Pinochet in 1986, were at
large today after escaping from a downtown prison through a tunnel
that took a year to dig.
   Authorities said seven other inmates who escaped Tuesday were
quickly captured by police, including one who had proved too big
for the tunnel's exit and was found stuck in it.
   Horacio Ojeda, director of the national prison system, said the
inmates dug a tunnel about 300 feet long and 20 inches wide from a
cell block to a nearby lot where a subway station was under
construction.
   The tunnel passed under a busy road.
   The escape was discovered at 2:30 a.m., Ojeda said.
   Several hours later, a man who identified himself as one of the
escapees called Radio Cooperativa in Santiago with details of the
operation.
   The caller said construction of the tunnel took more than a year
and that 24 inmates took part in planning and carrying out the
escape.
   ``The tunnel has a ventilation system operated with blowers,''
the man said. ``It has electric light and a rail system we used to
take out the removed material.''
   ``After we left, the tunnel remained open, and we think it was
used by other prisoners who were not part of our plan,'' the caller
added.
   The details desribed by the caller coincided with what reporters
saw at the prison.
   The entrance to the tunnel was inside a cell. The inmates used a
heavy cement block to cover the hole and hide it from the prison
guards.
   Ojeda described all the escapees as leftist guerrillas, and said
several were convicted in a Sept. 7, 1986, ambush of Pinochet's
motorcade southeast of Santiago.
   Pinochet was unhurt but five bodyguards were killed and 11
wounded in the attack, carried out by the pro-Communist Manuel
Rodriguez Patriotic Front.
   Pinochet took power following a 1973 coup that topped elected
President Salvador Allende. He is scheduled to turn over power to a
civilian government in February.
   Other escapees were front members implicated in the smuggling of
more than 30 tons of rifles, rockets, bazookas, grenades and other
weapons into the country in August 1986, Ojeda said.
   A list of the escapees disclosed by prison authorities includes
several top commanders of the guerrilla organization. Some belonged
to other leftist groups.
   According to a local organization of prisoners' relatives, four
of the escapees had been sentenced to death but were awaiting the
outcome of appeals. Three were convicted in the Pinochet
assassination attempt and the other for killing a policeman.

   Relatives of the victims applauded
as a former television cameraman convicted of strangling three
women was sentenced to die in the gas chamber.
   Dean Philip Carter, 34, showed no emotion as Superior Court
Judge Robert W. Thomas ordered the sentence Tuesday.
   Carter still faces trial for two other killings during an 18-day
spree in 1984.
   A jury recommended execution after it convicted Carter of
killing Culver City roommates Jillette L. Mills, 24, and Susan Lynn
Knoll, 33, and their friend, Bonnie Ann Guthrie, 24, of Los Angeles.
   Carter stared at a wall, his arms folded, as relatives of the
victims asked the judge to impose the death penalty.
   ``What was described as a loving father was the monster who
murdered and raped my daughter,'' said Sue Mills, 55, mother of
Jillette Mills.
   Jennifer Bollman, 32, Jillette Mills' sister, said Carter had
his day in court.
   ``Nothing has been spared in his defense. ... He has destroyed
the lives of his victims and their families and he must have death
in the gas chamber,'' she said.
   Thomas imposed prison terms totaling 32 years for the rape
counts and burglaries of the victims' homes, then stayed the
sentences and issued the death sentence.
   Relatives applauded heartily as the sentence was announced.
   ``It's been a long time coming. The loss we experienced in our
lives can never be replaced. Our feeling on this is that we don't
want this to happen to anyone else ever again,'' said Miss Knoll's
sister, Sandra Pender.
   Carter was already serving a 56-year prison sentence for
attempted murder in Ventura County and he faces murder trials for
the slayings of Tok Chum Kim in Oakland and Janette Ann Cullins in
San Diego.
   Police said Carter knew all his victims, meeting most of them in
bars and restaurants.
   In 1979, Carter landed a series of jobs with TV stations in
Alaska, including work as a cameraman in a team that won honors for
a documentary on the Eskimo heritage.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Sharply Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo today, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange made
up most of its morning losses and ended marginally lower.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average closed at 37,188.95, down
26.72 points, or 0.07 percent. The index, which rose 41.97 points
Tuesday, fell briefly below 37,000 in the morning, for the first
time since Friday.
   The dollar closed at 144.40 yen, up 1.15 yen from Tuesday's
143.25-yen finish. It opened at 144.90 yen and ranged between
143.95 and 145.00 yen.
   Traders attributed the dollar's strength to its sudden leap in
New York after the Cable News Network reported Tuesday afternoon
that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev might step down as
Communist Party chief.
   Yuji Nakao, a trader with Chemical Bank, said sales of yen for
profit-taking helped the dollar maintain its strength.
   The dollar suddenly turned down after hitting 145 yen, he said,
as the Bank of Japan was reported selling dollars to support the
yen. Heavy dollar-selling by some trading companies in Tokyo also
helped stem the dollar's advance, he said.
   Japan's central bank was seen intervening in the market at
around 144.65 yen and again at around 144.25 yen. The bank does not
officially comment on its exchange market activities.
   Nakao added that later reports by the Kyodo News Service of a
Soviet denial that Gorbachev might step down calmed market players
and slowed the dollar's rise against the yen. Kyodo quoted
unidentified Soviet sources.
   ``Today's fluctuation was all because of position adjustments
triggered by the rumor,'' he said.
   He said the dollar surged because market players sold yen in an
attempt to reduce their overbought yen positions.
   ``But the dollar could not go on getting stronger because of the
shrinking interest rate gap between the United States and Japan,''
Nakao added.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the index fell as the yen's
plunge discouraged Japanese stock investors.
   An overnight decline in the Dow Jones industrial average on Wall
Street also disheartened market players, said Izumi Yazaki at
Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities, Co.
   The index then made up some of its earlier losses as market
players bought back issues whose prices had fallen, she said.
   ``The rumor shook a market that had been already unstable ahead
of the election,'' Ms. Yazaki added.
   A general election for the lower house of Japan's Parliament is
expected Feb. 18.

   Legislators approved a bill early today
requiring minors to get parental consent before having abortions,
and defeated an effort to repeal a dormant law that penalizes
doctors who perform abortions.
   ``This is going to be a shot heard around the world,'' said
Republican Rep. Robert Welch. ``Wisconsin is a liberal state taking
a moderate stand on abortion.''
   The Assembly had sifted through 30 proposed amendments before
its 72-24 vote early today for a bill that would require girls
younger than age 18 to have the consent of at least one parent or a
court. Consent would not be required of incest and rape victims.
   ``We're elated,'' said Barbara Lyons, executive director of
Wisconsin Right to Life Inc. ``I think it deflates all the rhetoric
that the pro-choice movement was sweeping the country. Pro-life
isn't dead; it's alive.''
   The measure is expected to go to a Senate committee, where its
prospects were uncertain, Welch said.
   Democrats control the Assembly 55-42, but partisan affiliation
had little effect because there were more anti-abortion Democrats
in the Assembly than pro-choice Republicans.
   Assembly Speaker Thomas A. Loftus, a Democrat, said the bill
``fails in the areas of reality, compassion and common sense.''
   On Tuesday, the Assembly rejected by 54-42 an amendment to the
bill that would have excluded pregnant girls deemed suicidal by a
professional therapist or doctor.
   ``That's sick,'' said Rep. Louis Fortis, a Democrat. ``How can
you call yourself pro-life when you're rejecting an amendment that
would save the life of a teen-age girl?''
   The Assembly voted 57-39 earlier against a floor vote for a bill
to repeal a law that penalizes doctors or others who perform
abortions.
   The law was made unenforceable by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973
Roe Vs. Wade ruling that legalized abortion, but abortion foes want
it kept on the books in the hope the Roe vs. Wade decision will
someday be overturned.
   The Supreme Court's ruling in a challenge to a Missouri abortion
law last summer opened the way for state legislatures to challenge
existing abortion statutes.
   The Michigan Senate was expected to consider next week a
parental consent law that has was approved in December by the state
House.
   Pennsylvania in November approved a law that restrict abortion
after 24 weeks and requires a husband's notification for abortions
in most cases.

   Short of money and haunted by the
suicide of their skipper, the crewmen of the Soviet yacht Fazisi
are depending on raffle ticket sales to keep them in a prestigious
round-the-world yacht race.
   By the time the fourth leg of the Whitbread Round the World
race, 7,190 miles from Auckland to Punta Del Este, Uruguay, starts
Sunday, the team hopes to have raised about $200,000 from raffle
tickets for a luxury BMW.
   The car was donated by a New Zealand company and the raffle ends
today.
   ``We need new sails for the voyage around Cape Horn,'' said the
new skipper, Skip Novak.
   New Zealanders have adopted the 83-foot aluminum yacht and its
mixed crew of 12 Soviets, two Americans, one New Zealander and a
Frenchman.
   Many were touched by the crew's plight and the suicide of
skipper Alexei Grishencko, who hanged himself from a tree in Punta
Del Este after the first leg of the voyage.
   ``He walked away from the hotel and we found him two days later.
He had been depressed and under pressure,'' said Novak.
   New Zealand yachtsmen organized a party for 1,000 people in a
boatyard and raised $7,200. A local radio station is hosting a
$60-a plate dinner and a fashion show Thursday night.
   Also helping the fundraising are sales of red T-shirts with the
hammer and sickle emblem of the Soviet Union emblazoned above the
yacht's name.
   Unlike the other contestants, Fazisi doesn't have a corporate
sponsor. Pepsi Cola withdrew its sponsorship because of negative
feedback over its support for a Communist yacht, Novak said.
   ``It wasn't the imaginative thing to do considering the changes
that have been going on in the Soviet Union since we started in
September last year,'' he said.
   The crewmen, who come from all over the Soviet Union, have found
it frustrating trying to keep up with the momentous changes taking
place at home.
   ``At sea we listen to the BBC but the guys don't get the full
story. When they get to port they get all the papers,'' Novak said.
   Novak, 37, a professional sailor from Chicago, offered himself
as a consultant to a Soviet team planning to sail in the
37,950-mile race.
   The yacht's construction was financed by Fazisi, a joint venture
of a Soviet Georgia-based state enterprise and a West German
company with interests in fishing, forestry and trade.
   Construction of the yacht started so late that it had to be
air-freighted from the Soviet Union to Britain aboard the world's
largest airplane, an Antonov 124.
   It was finished barely in time for the race start.
   Novak said Fazisi, standing eighth overall in the fleet of 23
yachts from 13 countries, is doing better on its shoestring budget
than some yachts with millions of dollars in sponsorship and a year
of trial racing.
   He estimates that the total cost of the Fazisi challenge will be
$3 million, about one quarter of other challenges.
   The money raised in New Zealand will get them to Uruguay.
   ``We don't know what we do when we get there,'' Novak said. ``We
are hoping that we can pick up some American sponsorship for the
leg to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., so we can finish the race.
   ``We need another $400,000, but we are philosophical and keen to
finish,'' he said.

   Federal authorities investigating the mail bomb
addressed to a fundamentalist minister that blew up in his
daughter's lap were skeptical of a link to earlier, apparently
race-related bombings.
   Lisa Osteen, 31, daughter of the Rev. John Osteen of the
Lakewood Church, suffered bruises and burns to her torso and upper
legs when the bomb exploded Tuesday morning. She was listed in good
condition at Methodist Hospital.
   In December, nail-studded pipe bombs killed a federal judge near
Birmingham, Ala., and a black civil rights lawyer in Savannah, Ga.
   ``There doesn't appear to be a tremendous amount of
similarities, but we're not ruling anything out yet,'' said Bob
Switzer, special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
   ``We have no idea what the motive is. We can't link this to
anything else,'' said Switzer.
   ``The bomb squad is trying to piece it all together,'' said
police Sgt. H.G. Welch.
   Ms. Osteen, director of ministries at the 10,000-member church,
apparently triggered the nail-packed bomb when she unwrapped the
book-size package, which was addressed to her father.
   ``We just thank God that she was protected. And we know the
angels of God watched after her and our prayers protected her,''
said Osteen, 68, who was not at the church at the time.
   ``We'll pray for those who have done this,'' he added. ``We know
they are sick and they need help.''
   Ms. Osteen was lucky to have survived the blast that shredded
her chair and damaged her office, said Dr. Paul Pepe of Houston
Emergency Medical Services.
   Osteen backs school prayer and opposes abortion in his
nationally televised church services, but he isn't a widely known
public figure, said the Rev. Jim Mitchell, a religion scholar at
the University of Houston.
   The racially mixed, non-denominational church features speaking
in tongues and faith healing. Osteen's chapel, with room for 8,200
faithful, is the largest in Houston.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people live in fear and have a right
to know if Rocky Flats has adversely effected their health, says
the attorney who filed two class-action lawsuits against the
nuclear weapons plant's former operators.
   Also Tuesday, a $2 billion lawsuit was filed in Ohio against a
former operator of another federally owned nuclear factory, the
Fernald uranium processing plant. NLO Inc. and its parent company
were accused of subjecting employees to a hazardous, radioactive
workplace.
   The Denver lawsuits allege that Rockwell International Corp. and
its predecessor, Dow Chemical Co., were careless and negligent in
the treatment of hazardous wastes at Rocky Flats. The plant, 16
miles northwest of Denver, has manufactured plutonium triggers for
nuclear weapons since 1953.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins suspended plutonium processing
operations at Rocky Flats in November. He said the shutdown would
remain in effect until DOE is convinced safety and health standards
are being met.
   The lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court seek independent study
of health risks posed by the nuclear weapons plant, $250 million in
economic damages for devaluation of property and $300 million in
other damages. Former workers also want an unspecified amount of
money because the stigma of their past employment prevents them
from finding new jobs or health insurance.
   ``They (the plaintiffs) want to be told the truth by someone who
is independent and not controlled by the government or the
operators of Rocky Flats,'' said attorney Bruce DeBoskey.
   ``This is not a lawsuit to close Rocky Flats, but to have it run
properly,'' he said.
   The lawsuits said that actions by Dow and Rockwell led to
repeated releases of both radioactive and non-radioactive hazardous
substances into the atmosphere and violations of state and federal
environmental health and safety laws.
   Five neighbors of the plant filed one of the lawsuits on behalf
of about 10,000 property owners and up to 50,000 people who live
near the plant. They asked the court to halt the further releases
of hazardous substances.
   Dow Chemical operated the plant from 1953 until 1975, when
Rockwell took over. Last year, the Department of Energy replaced
Rockwell with EG&amp;G Inc. after the FBI and the Environmental
Protection Agency raided Rocky Flats, looking for evidence of
illegal disposal of hazardous wastes.
   The other lawsuit was filed by the Building and Construction
Trades Department, AFL-CIO, and the Construction Trades Council on
behalf of more than 10,000 current and former plant workers.
   That suit asks the court to order the defendants to create a
fund to finance reasonable medical monitoring and surveillance,
including independent scientific studies of adverse health effects.
   Rockwell officials in El Segundo, Calif., declined to comment,
saying they had not seen the court documents. Dow Chemical
officials at company headquarters in Midland, Mich., did not reply
to calls seeking comment.
   DeBoskey said the lawsuits ``stem from people's concern and
their fear over whether or not they have lost money and whether or
not their health has been affected by the operations at the plant.''
   ``That fear was heightened by the FBI raid last summer,''
DeBoskey said in a telephone interview. ``People are afraid.
They're afraid and they want to know the truth from people other
than the ones who have caused the pollution.''
   DOE last year identified Rocky Flats as the most hazardous site
in the nation's nuclear weapons complex, saying toxic chemicals
contaminated an underground reservoir and threatened nearby city
water supplies.
   The Ohio lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati,
accused NLO and parent NL Industries Inc. of failing to properly
store or contain highly radioactive substances at the Feed
Materials Production Center in Fernald.
   The plant, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, processes uranium
for the Energy Department's production of nuclear weapons.
   The lawsuit says the employees suffered loss of income,
emotional distress including increased fear of cancer, and
diminished ability to obtain other jobs or insurance.
   It seeks $2 billion in damages plus unspecified punitive damages
and payment for extended medical monitoring of the employees.

<TEXT>
   A Princeton University graduate has asked
the state Supreme Court to require two campus eating clubs to admit
women.
   Sally Frank, now an instructor on discrimination cases at New
York Law School, on Tuesday urged the high court to end what she
called 21 years of discrimination at the Ivy Club and the Tiger
Inn, which do not admit women.
   Ms. Frank said the clubs and Princeton University have a
``symbiotic relationship'' that removes them from protection under
laws governing private organizations.
   But attorneys for the clubs compared the groups to fraternities
and sororities, and said they have the right to choose their own
members.
   ``We have to make the distinction between civil rights and
social relationships,'' said Barbara Strapp Nelson, who represented
the Ivy Club. ``Whether one should maintain a social relationship
with another is not regulated by the state.''
   The clubs are among 13 private eating clubs at Princeton. Most
of the juniors and seniors at Princeton eat at these clubs, which
are in privately-owned houses near the campus.
   Since Princeton began admitting women in 1969, only the Ivy Club
and the Tiger Inn have refused to change their rules and admit
females.
   The high court heard the case after a three judge panel of the
Appellate Division of Superior Court last year reversed a 1987
decision by the state Division on Civil Rights. The civil rights
agency had ordered the clubs to admit women.
   Ms. Frank, who began her protest as a junior at Princeton in
1979, said the university has billed the eating club in its
publications as ``part of the Princeton experience.''
   Deputy Attorney General Susan Reisner, one of several attorneys
who represented Ms. Frank's case, said ``the clubs had such a close
connection to Princeton, they could not claim exemption (to
anti-discrimination laws) as a strictly private club.''
   Attorneys for the clubs countered that the clubs are not part of
the university.
   Russell Beatie Jr., representing the Tiger Inn, said the case
pits discrimination laws and privacy laws.
   He accused Ms. Frank of ``seeking admission for purposes other
than a true desire to be a member of the Tiger Inn,'' calling her
``energy looking for a cause.''
   Attorneys for the clubs asked the court to give them another
hearing to dispute facts presented by Ms. Frank's attorneys.
   Ms. Frank estimated after the hearing that if the court returns
the matter to a lower level, it could take six more years to
settle. However, she vowed to continue her fight.
   ``There is a continuing and ongoing interest by (female)
students to join these clubs,'' Ms. Frank said.

   A light-skinned black woman who contends she was
fired as an IRS clerk-typist because of her color said her
darker-skinned boss told her that her life was too easy, an
attorney said.
   In opening arguments Tuesday in U.S. District Court, Michael
Weinstock, attorney for Tracy Lynn Morrow, said she was fired from
her IRS job after she ``was harassed based on her personal physical
characteristics.''
   Ms. Morrow testified her IRS supervisor, Ruby Lewis, told her,
``The way you look is your problem.''
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney S. Lark Ingram, representing Ms.
Lewis, said Ms. Morrow's problem wasn't her skin: it was her
typing, her grammar, and her attitude.
   Ms. Morrow is suing Ms. Lewis and the Internal Revenue Service,
seeking up to $60,000 in back pay and other payments, plus
reinstatement to her $14,000-a-year job with the IRS' Atlanta
office, where she worked from early 1985 until she was fired in
March 1986.
   If Ms. Morrow wins her lawsuit, she would become the first black
worker to collect damages from a black supervisor because of
skin-tone discrimination, according to her attorneys and federal
equal-opportunity officials.
   Weinstock said that ``the tone of her skin'' is the central
issue in how Ms. Morrow was treated at the IRS.
   Weinstock said Ms. Lewis made demeaning references to Ms.
Morrow's status as a lighter-skinned black, such as, ``you need
some sun,'' and ``you've had it too easy.''
   Ms. Morrow testified that Ms. Lewis was concerned about race,
telling the workers, ``We're a black office, we had to watch how
white people might look at us.''
   Midge L. Wilson, a professor at DePaul University who has
studied intraracial bias among blacks, said both light- and
dark-skinned blacks sometimes exhibit signs of discrimination
against the other.
   ``They might create a payback situation to make life
uncomfortable,'' she said.
   But Ms. Ingram argued that ``Ruby Lewis did not perceive the
plaintiff as having different skin color from she.''
   She said the issue was Ms. Morrow's job performance.
   From the time Ms. Morrow arrived, ``she couldn't type,'' Ms.
Ingram said. ``She couldn't write simple sentences.''
   Ms. Lewis and other IRS supervisors tried to work around Ms.
Morrow's problems, including attempts to find her another position,
Ms. Ingram said. She said it was another IRS supervisor _ not Ms.
Lewis _ who decided to fire Ms. Morrow.
   The non-jury trial is expected to last all week.

<HEAD>Cold Chills Plains; Storm Moves into Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bitter cold shouldered its way from the Yukon today on a slow
southeastern drive into the northern Plains and toward the Great
Lakes.
   More snow was forecast today for the central Rockies' western
slopes and the mountains of Arizona, and the storm was expected to
join with the cold front _ the nation's largest mass of frigid air
since Christmas _ to spawn blizzard conditions from Montana to
Minnesota.
   Rain diminished along the northern and central Pacific Coast
today, although more heavy rain and high winds were expected
tonight.
   Snow advisories remained in effect for Oregon's mountains.
   On Tuesday, over 2 feet of snow fell in parts of New England,
and arctic cold dropped the temperature in International Falls,
Minn., by 46 degrees in less than 24 hours, from 35 degrees Monday
to 11 below zero Tuesday morning.
   Strong winds Tuesday produced a wind-chill reading of 63 degrees
below zero at Cutbank, Mont.
   In Dexter, Maine, a snow-covered department store roof collapsed
late Tuesday afternoon, slightly injuring three people. The
collapse followed the biggest winter storm of the season, which
dumped about 14 inches of snow in the Dexter area.
   Today's forecast called for showers and a few thunderstorms from
northwestern Florida into South Carolina. Some showers and
thunderstorms were also expected over southern Florida.
   Tuesday's low temperature was minus 19 at Thief River Falls,
Minn.
   Two Florida cities tied record warm temperatures for the date:
Fort Lauderdale hit 83 degrees and Fort Myers reached 86, the
nation's high.

   Frederick W. Winterbotham, who played a key role
in exploiting broken German codes in World War II and wrote the
bestselling memoir ``The Ultra Secret,'' died Sunday of natural
causes at age 92.
   Winterbotham was a pilot in World War I, and in 1929 was made
head of aerial intelligence in MI6, the British intelligence agency.
   In the 1930s he befriended senior Nazi figures in Germany and
gleaned information about the Luftwaffe. In 1939 he helped devise a
vital new method of aerial reconnaissance photography.
   His most important work was with ``Enigma,'' the top-secret
German code system that the British had managed to penetrate.
   His work made him a confidant of wartime Prime Minister Winston
Churchill. But he remained an unsung war hero, because the cracking
of Enigma was considered so secret it was not revealed until 30
years after the war, when he published ``The Ultra Secret.''

Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires in battles with the German
Luftwaffe, Peterson advanced to squadron commander at age 21 and
colonel at 23.
   He kept the rank when he moved to the U.S. Army Air Corps to fly
P-47 Thunderbolts in 1943. He remains the Air Force's youngest-ever
colonel.
   In more than 200 combat missions, Peterson claimed nine kills
and nine more probable kills, twice parachuting from damaged
Spitfires.
   He is the only American fighter pilot to win the U.S.
Distinguished Service Cross and Britain's Distinguished Service

<HEAD>McDonald's Opens in Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the familiar sign of the Golden Arches
embellished by the Soviet hammer-and-sickle flag, McDonald's opened
in Moscow today to offer Russians their first taste of Western
consumerism, not to mention hamburgers.
   Hundreds of people tried gingerly to get their fingers around
their first American hamburger. They tried eating them one-handed.
They picked them apart to examine the contents.
   One young woman finally squashed her Big Mac in order to fit her
lips around it.
   ``It tasted great!'' said a 14-year-old boy, a sesame seed still
stuck to his nose.
   The restaurant ``is a lot different from a stolovaya,'' he
continued, referring to the run-down, dirty cafeterias that slop
out dishes like rice and fat or boiled sausage in the Soviet
Union's closest approximation to fast food.
   The restaurant was 14 years in the making, but finally, thanks
to the reforms of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, people got a
first-hand look at such alien concepts as efficiency and fast,
friendly service.
   Unlike nearly all other Western firms opening up in Moscow,
McDonald's is selling for rubles, which are worthless outside the
Soviet Union and won't even buy much in the shortage-plagued
country. It expects to serve 15,000 people a day.
   Hundreds of people lined up for the long-awaited grand opening,
reaching eagerly for McDonald's flags and pins handed out by the
hamburger chain's brigade of workers. An hour before opening, the
McDonald's crew handed out advertising leaflets at the Pushkin
Square metro stop a few yards away.
   Normally dour-faced citizens broke into grins, catching the
infectious cheerful mood from youthful Soviet staffers hired for
their ability to smile and work hard. Accordions played folk songs
and women in traditional costumes danced with cartoon characters.
   The line of about 500 people moved steadily, thanks to
McDonald's decision to build and staff 27 cash registers.
   ``I only waited an hour and I think they served thousands before
me,'' said a happy middle-aged woman from the aluminum plant on
Dmitrovskoye Highway. ``And it was only 10 rubles for all this,''
she said, pointing to a bag packed with unfamiliar treats like
cheeseburgers and ``Filay-o-feesh'' sandwiches. ``I'm taking it
back for the girls at the factory to try.''
   ``Beeg Maks'' were priced at 3.75 rubles, and double
cheeseburgers at 3 rubles _ about two hours' pay for a starting
McDonald's staffer or the average Soviet worker. That's a bit high
compared to state restaurants but much cheaper than the private
cooperative outlets that have sprung up in the past year.
   Three Armenian students said they flew 1,250 miles from Yerevan
to Moscow just for the McDonald's opening.
   ``It was magnificent,'' said Ida Zakharyan, gushing over the
clean, brightly colored interior and the 10-minute service she
experienced.
   ``Well, my wife makes better food,'' said Victor Kunyasev of
Moscow. ``But it was nice, a good place to take a break and grab a
bite to eat.''
   The restaurant, which is a joint venture of McDonald's of Canada
and the city of Moscow, limited purchases to 10 Big Macs per
customer to prevent a local entrepreneur from setting up an
unauthorized subsidiary around the corner.
   McDonald's built its own factory, including a bakery, a dairy, a
meat-processing plant and even a potato storage yard, to provide
its own guaranteed supplies in a country where as much as 25
percent of the harvest rots on the way to the consumer.
   One McDonald's associate in the crowd said the firm wound up
importing wooden crates from Finland for storing potatoes because
``when they went to build crates, they found there was no wood, and
no nails. They found you need a permit to buy nails.''
   The enormous investment of $50 million was likely balanced,
however, by the free publicity the firm is receiving from an army
of correspondents, who nearly outnumbered the customers at the
opening hour.

   A teacher and a dentist will face each
other in a runoff election for the City Council seat of a civil
rights attorney slain by a mail bomb.
   A Feb. 20 runoff election was necessary because no candidate
received a majority of the 2,572 votes cast in Tuesday's election.
Robert Robinson, an NAACP attorney, had two years left on his
council term when he was slain by a mail bomb Dec. 18.
   Clifford Hardwick III finished first with 920 votes. He will
face Dr. Phyllis Mack, who finished second among the eight
candidates with 494 votes.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, a man under investigation in the mail bomb
slayings last month of Robinson and a federal judge in Alabama gave
samples of his blood, saliva and hair to the FBI.
   Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, a 46-year-old junk dealer in Enterprise
in southeast Alabama, was taken by police to a hospital, where he
spent 45 minutes providing samples requested in a federal grand
jury subpoena issued last week. He was then questioned at City Hall
for more than two hours.
   O'Ferrell has been questioned extensively in the FBI's
investigation of the slayings of 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
Judge Robert Vance of Birmingham and Robinson.
   Similar package bombs were discovered and defused at the 11th
Circuit courthouse in Atlanta and the Jacksonville, Fla., chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Agents have confiscated typewriters from O'Ferrell. Federal
sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said the printing
on letters associated with the bombs matched that on a 1988 letter
O'Ferrell wrote to the 11th Circuit concerning a case he lost
before the court.
   Agents last week searched O'Ferrell's home and business and
pumped out his septic tanks looking for evidence. The FBI has
refused to say whether it found any clues, but dozens of agents
remain in southeast Alabama.
   In another development, a pipe bomb mailed to a church in
Houston exploded Tuesday morning, injuring Lisa Osteen, the
30-year-old daughter of the pastor, the Rev. John Osteen.
   Charles B. Kearney, an FBI spokesman in Houston, said there did
not appear to be any similarities between the Texas bomb and the
December mail bombs.
   However, O'Ferrell and his attorney, Paul Harden, said the
Houston bombing should demonstrate that O'Ferrell, who has been
under close scrutiny in Enterprise, had nothing to do with any of
the attacks.
   ``It's a sad state of affairs, but it does in my mind show Wayne
O'Ferrell, who has been in Enterprise since day one, is in no way,
shape or form involved,'' Harden said.
   In Savannah, about 29 percent of the District 5 voters cast
ballots, only slightly above the average for a special election,
officials said.
   Councilman Willie Brown said he was disappointed by the turnout.
   ``I think it's a sad commentary that on the heels of what
everybody has been praising Robbie (Robinson) for, that no one came
out to show their respect and vote for the most worthy
replacement,'' Brown said.
   Funeral home operator Horace Hall, who had been endorsed by
Robinson's widow, Anne, finished fourth with 201 votes.

   A jetliner crash survivor was charged at a
hospital with drug possession after passing about 5 ounces of
cocaine through his digestive tract, and what's believed to be the
first crash lawsuit has been filed.
   Antonio Zuluaga, who was critically injured, was the second
passenger from Avianca Flight 52 alleged to have been carrying
condoms containing cocaine inside his body, police said.
   The Boeing 707, en route from Bogota and the Colombian drug
capital of Medellin, smacked into a hillside Thursday night 15
miles northeast of Kennedy International Airport. The crash killed
73 people and left 86 survivors.
   Zuluaga was being treated at Nassau County Medical Center in
East Meadow, for a fractured spine, broken ribs, a dislocated hip
and possibly a broken knee.
   Each of the 19 condoms he passed had about 8 grams of the drug,
police Sgt. Richard Snizek said Tuesday.
   Another man, Jose Figueroa, was found to have cocaine-filled
condoms in his intestines when doctors operated on him the day
after the crash to stop internal bleeding, authorities said.
Figueroa's body may contain as many as 70 more cocaine packets of
varying size and police were waiting to determine the amount before
charging him, said Donald Kane, deputy chief of detectives.
   The U.S. District Court lawsuit, filed Tuesday by a New Jersey
man who said he was disabled in the crash, seeks $202.5 million
from the airline. It says Avianca was negligent because it failed
to furnish a safe aircraft and a competent crew.
   The plaintiff, Jesus Manuel Pinzon, 31, of Elizabeth, N.J.,
suffered multiple broken bones, cuts and internal injuries. He was
returning from a visit to relatives in Bogota.
   His lawyer, Robert A. Solomon, said Pinzon was permanently
disabled and unable to return to his $400-a-week job at a New
Jersey clothing factory. He is being treated at Elizabeth General
Hospital.
   Pinzon's 2-year-old son, Brian, who was sitting in the seat next
to his father, suffered minor head injuries and was not
hospitalized.
   A telephone call to Avianca's offices for comment was not
answered.
   A final report of the crash is unlikely for at least nine
months. Reports so far have centered on who was responsible for the
decision not to land when fuel was running low.
   As the plane circled around New Jersey, about 45 minutes before
the crash, captain Laureano Caviedes Hoyos asked for ``priority''
to land rather than declaring an ``emergency,'' investigators said.
   The lead investigator, Barry Trotter of the National
Transportation Safety Board, said the controllers responded to
Caviedes' request by moving the flight from a holding pattern to an
approach pattern, although the plane was not moved to the first
slot among approaching planes.
   ``The pilot apparently thought when he came out of the holding
pattern that he had enough fuel and that's why he appears (in taped
conversations) to be calm and cool,'' Trotter said Tuesday.
   ``But what we don't think he was aware of is that he was going
to be vectored all around Long Island for 37 minutes before being
cleared for landing at Kennedy.''
   Trotter said Avianca does not require its pilots to declare a
fuel emergency when levels drop below a certain point, and other
airline officials said it is typically up to the captain to make
such a declaration.
   An American Airlines jet was brought in shortly before the crash
when its pilot told controllers it had just 14 minutes of fuel
remaining. Bad weather delayed landings at Kennedy for many flights
the night of the crash.
   Caviedes had 17 years experience flying into Kennedy, including

<HEAD>Bulgarian Opposition Rejects Communist Offer to Share Power</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgaria's opposition today rejected a
Communist offer to share power before the first free elections in
more than four decades.
   Petar Beron, spokesman for the loose opposition umbrella group,
the Union of Democratic Forces, spoke on Sofia radio, the state
news agency BTA said.
   Opposition leaders have rejected previous Communist offers to
enter what Communist Party chief Petar Mladenov called a
``government of national concord'' before the elections. They had
called the offers a Communist ploy to get the opposition to share
responsibility for four decades of mismanagement.
   The opposition has been holding talks with the Communists on
power-sharing.
   Mladenov reiterated the Communist offer to share power in an
opening speech Tuesday to a party congress, where he is trying to
avoid a formal split between reformers and hard-liners.
   The congress was moved up from 1991 after Bulgaria was caught up
in the pro-democracy movement sweeping Eastern Europe. Bulgaria's
hard-line Communist leader, Todor Zhivkov, was outsed Nov. 10 after
35 years in power.
   Mladenov gave no details of how much power the Communists would
have in his proposed power-sharing Cabinet.
   Governments dominated by non-Communists are running East Germany
and Czechoslovakia prior to their free elections in March and June,
respectively.
   Mladenov also said Tuesday that Bulgaria's first free elections
should be held in May, not in November as the opposition had
demanded.
   It was one of the few points of the party chief's speech that
was applauded by the 2,752 congress delegates.
   According to BTA, Beron told Radio Sofia today that his group
has decided to consent to May elections because it believes the
present Communist-dominated Parliament simply cannot enact any
substantial reforms.
   Reformers made a strong showing today as the Communist party
congress entered its second day.
   Reform-minded journalist Stefan Prodev, chief editor of the
weekly Narodna Cultura who was chosen two days ago to head the
official Journalists' Union, said Communists could win public
support only by shedding ``dogmas of a harmful ideology'' that he
charged still dominated the views of most party members.
   Politburo member Alexander Lilov, one of the triumvirate running
the country with Mladenov and fellow Politburo reformer Andrei
Lukanov, said:
   ``While the party and country are in a crisis, we have not yet
reached the climax. Our party cannot start an offensive now because
of a lack of confidence.'' He said the party must be radically
overhauled to win elections.
   Unlike their comrades elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Bulgaria's
Communists face a relatively weak opposition and have not
relinquished much power since Zhivkov was ousted. Leaders such as
Lukanov consistently have expressed confidence the Communists can
still win a substantial share of the vote, or even a majority, at
the May elections. The opposition disputes that.
   Lilov, a possible contender for the party leadership if Mladenov
gives up the post, said the party has been hurt by failing to
implement reforms.
   ``We are lagging behind. If the programs are not competent and
realistic, we will lose,'' he told the congress. He accused Premier
Georgi Atanassov, a holdover from the Zhivkov era, of failing to
work out an economic program.
   Atanassov retained his post after Zhivkov's ouster, apparently
because he backed Mladenov and other Politburo colleagues who
engineered the removal of Zhivkov after 35 years in power.
   But he has done nothing to tackle what Mladenov conceded Tuesday
was mounting economic chaos. Bulgaria has been hit in the past two
weeks by unprecedented labor stoppages. Teachers went on strike as
the congress opened.
   Miners who walked off the job across the country last week
resumed work, but they continued negotiations with the government
for better conditions.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops of renegade Gen. Michel Aoun
attacked major strongholds of the rival Lebanese Forces militia
today in an attempt to take control of the Christian enclave.
   Police reported heavy fighting with tanks, recoilless cannons,
mortars and machine guns in four Christian suburbs north of Beirut.
A police spokesman said some of Aoun's 20,000 troops surrounded
Lebanese Forces' barracks, shouting orders through bullhorns for
the Christian militiamen to surrender.
   It was the worst fighting between Christian forces in a year.
   Aoun's command and the office of Samir Geagea, the Lebanese
Forces' commander, released separate statements saying a cease-fire
was called for 2 p.m., but police said fighting persisted after the
deadline.
   The intensity of the battles decreased, ``but they are still
fighting,'' a police spokesman said in the afternoon. He said no
casualty report was available.
   Earlier, Aoun's troops stormed the House of the Future think
tank, operated Lebanese Forces intellectuals in the northern suburb
of Dbaiyeh, and police said they were moving into a nearby militia
barracks.
   The command of the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces conceded the
think tank had fallen to Aoun's troops.
   A police spokesman said the House of the Future compound ``fell
to Aoun's forces in about 30 minutes. The militia force guarding it
did not number more than 20 men.''
   Those who escaped the fighting withdrew to the nearby barracks,
he said.
   The Christian Voice of Lebanon radio, in a brief report, said
automatic fire was also reported in the suburb of Aukar, where the
U.S. Embassy is located. It gave no details.
   U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy and all American diplomats
evacuated from the embassy Sept. 6 after pro-Aoun demonstrators
demanding support for the rebellious general surrounded it.
   Telephone calls to the U.S. Embassy as well as to several other
areas of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave were not answered.
   The police official, who cannot be named under regulations, said
Aoun's troops surrounded Lebanese Forces barracks in Adonis and
Naccache and demanded the fighters defending them give up.
   Tension had been rising between Aoun and Geagea since Parliament
elected Elias Hrawi president Nov. 24 under an Arab League-brokered
peace plan to end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Geagea recognizes Hrawi, but Aoun does not, claiming he is a
lackey of the Syrians, who control most of Lebanon and back Moslem
militias. Aoun has pledged to keep fighting until Syria withdraws
its 40,000 soldiers from Lebanon.
   Geagea, in an interview broadcast by the Christian Voice of
Lebanon radio, said: ``We will not permit anyone to slaughter the
Lebanese Forces.''
   The radio, mouthpiece of the right-wing Phalange party,
interrupted its programs to broadcast the interview with Geagea.
The Phalange, the main Christian political group, is also at odds
with Aoun.
   Addressing Aoun, Geagea said: ``I call on those in charge of the
army to alter the policy they've been following ... we have the
patience of Job, but this cannot go on forever,''
   ``I've ordered all the Lebanese Forces fighters to stay in their
barracks and defend them,'' Geagea said.
   Aoun, in a brief statement broadcast by his Radio Lebanon, spoke
only of ``scattered disorders that the troops have been ordered to
put an end to.''
   The police official said all police patrols in Christian east
Beirut were ordered back to headquarters and their stations to
avoid being caught in cross-fire in case the clashes spread.
   The statement reflected the police concern the clashes might
engulf other traditional Lebanese Forces' strongholds in east
Beirut.
   The clashes broke out despite intensified efforts to head off a
showdown between Aoun's troops and Geagea's militia for control of
the Christian enclave.
   Aoun's troops established control Tuesday over four barracks
that Geagea's militia maintained on Beirut's eastern and northern
edges and later moved into a compound that commands the main
coastal highway north of Beirut.
   Aoun said Tuesday his fighters were ordered to take over all
Lebanese Forces barracks in the Christian enclave.
   Aoun first moved against the Lebanese forces in February 1989,
when his forces flushed out the militia from the Metn mountainous
regions northeast of the capital in a four-day crackdown that
killed 82 people and wounded 200.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Ruling Against Hubbard Book Violates First Amendment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge's decision blocking a book critical of
Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard is a ``dagger in the
heart of the First Amendment,'' the publisher's lawyer says.
   ``It really threatens to impair the right of biographers and
scholars to study the works of other people who are of great public
interest,'' Melvin Wulf said Tuesday after the ruling by U.S.
District Judge Louis L. Stanton.
   Stanton said parts of the book, which is still in manuscript
form, violated the copyrights of Hubbard's authorized biographer.
   The judge said ``A Piece of Blue Sky'' could be published after
infringing passages were deleted, something he said could easily be
done because much of the material was set off at the beginning of
chapters.
   Wulf, an attorney for the publisher, Carol Publishing Group,
said the judge showed a ``total misunderstanding'' of the fair use
law, which says copyrighted works can be used for criticism, news
reporting, teaching or research.
   The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit by New Era Publications
International, which holds copyrights to Hubbard's private papers
for the writing of his authorized biography. The company also is
the publisher of Scientology books.
   New Era lawyer Jonathan Rubell said his client had never
intended to stop the book's publication.
   ``It was the use of expression rather than factual presentation
that we were complaining about,'' he said.
   Hubbard, who died in 1986, wrote dozens of books about
Scientology and his philosophy. He taught that spiritual competence
is achieved by ``erasing'' mental images in the unconscious mind
that cause irrational behavior.
   ``A Piece of Blue Sky'' was written by Jonathan Caven-Atack, who
became disillusioned with Hubbard's teachings after following them
for nine years.
   According to Stanton's decision, Atack ``came to believe that
Scientology is a dangerous cult and that Mr. Hubbard, far from
being the gentle prophet portrayed in Church literature, was a
paranoid, vindictive and profoundly disturbed man.''
   After receiving permission from Stanton to review the
manuscript, New Era said 121 passages, less than 3 percent of the
book, were from copyrighted sources.

   The roof of a century-old department store
caved in under the weight of the heaviest snowfall of the season,
slightly injuring three people, officials said today.
   Two employees and a fireman who were inside when the roof gave
way Tuesday were treated at a hospital and released.
   Firefighters had been called in shortly before accident for fear
water leaking from the roof would short-circuit the lights. Jackie
Knowles, a store employee who escaped, said ``something went off
like a bomb'' seconds before the collapse.
   Part of the third floor crashed into the second floor.
   ``It sounded like a roll of thunder,'' said Jerry Townsend, who
saw the accident from across the street.
   Sheriff's Sgt. Avis Merrill said the collapse was caused by a
combination of ice and the 14 inches of snow dumped overnight
Monday and Tuesday.

   Massachusetts House Minority Leader Steven Pierce
has launched his campaign for the Republican nomination for
governor, declaring the state under the Democrats is ``full of
problems, doubts and cynicism.''
   ``Ronald Reagan put it best when he sought successfully the
presidency during a time when our nation was in dire straits,''
Pierce said Tuesday.
   Quoting Reagan, Pierce said: ``The major issue of this campaign
is the direct political, personal and moral responsibility of the
Democratic Party leadership ... for the unprecedented calamity that
has befallen us.''
   Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis, a frequent target of Pierce's
criticism, is not seeking re-election.
   The Massachusetts Miracle, the economic boom that nearly carried
Dukakis to the White House, has vanished in the past year, and the
state is struggling with a deficit.
   Pierce, who represents Westfield, has been a state
representative since 1978 and first elected to the House Republican
leadership in 1983.
   Pierce and former U.S. Attorney William Weld are the leading
candidates for the GOP nomination. Others include former
Congressman Paul Cronin, former Metropolitan District Commissioner
Guy Carbone and Len Umina, an electrical engineer.
   Democrats running include Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, former
Attorney General Francis Bellotti, Boston University President John
Silber and state Rep. John Flood.

<HEAD>West Germans Praise Gorbachev's Comments on Reunification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German officials and media today praised
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for softening his view on
German reunification and said it could give hope to disheartened
East Germans.
   Disgraced former Communist Party leader Erich Honecker was
released from prison Tuesday night after justice officials
determined he was too frail to withstand the rigors of imprisonment
while awaiting trial on treason charges.
   Gorbachev said Tuesday in Moscow that he believed one Germany
was likely in the future, but he added that Germans ``should not
decide this important question on the streets.''
   He referred to the growing number of demonstrations in East
Germany in support of reunification.
   Gorbachev's statement was his most tolerant yet on the subject
of a single Germany, which has been opposed by Communists for more
than 40 years. East German Communists on Tuesday endorsed for
reunification for the first time.
   In West Germany, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told
West German Radio that Gorbachev had ``correctly analyzed'' the
situation and again shown his political skill.
   West German officials and media praised Gorbachev's view as
``realistic'' and described it as an important sign of hope for
East Germans who have lost faith in their government.
   Communist leaders launched their uphill campaign for March 18
parliamentary elections with a news conference to unveil their
``European concept'' that aims for a united and demilitarized
Europe.
   Party ideologist Peter Brie said the Communists support ``the
togetherness of the German nation,'' and urged a thoughtful and
measured approach to reunification.
   In an interview with the West German Bild newspaper, party
leader Gregor Gysi complained that the reunification drive is
moving too quickly.
   Asked if the Communists oppose reunification, Gysi told the
newspaper: ``No, not at all. This process cannot be stopped any
more. But it is irresponsible to do things in such a way now as if
it were possible tomorrow.''
   The reunification issue promises to dominate the election
campaign that will seat a new leadership in less than seven weeks.
   Increasing numbers of East Germans have demonstrated for union
with wealthy and prosperous West Germany as their own economy
tumbles and an exodus of skilled workers continues unchecked.
   More than 340,000 people fled East Germany last year, having
lost hope that their spartan living conditions would improve. The
devastating flight has included as many as 2,500 people daily since
Jan. 1.
   The Communists are widely distrusted because of corruption
scandals that have surfaced since the peaceful pro-democracy revolt
last fall, and because they carry the blame for leading East
Germany into its current economic and political crises.
   The man most blamed for the country's problems, Honecker, was
set free after an East Berlin court rejected a request that he be
kept in prison until his trial in March. He was jailed Monday.
   The court decided that ``despite the severity of the charges
against Honecker, the state of the accused's health does not permit
imprisonment,'' the official ADN news agency reported.
   A spokesman for Chief Prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph promised
that the investigation against Honecker would proceed.
   ADN said the court acted on advice from two doctors who examined
Honecker independently. Honecker, 77, underwent surgery on Jan. 8
to remove a malignant kidney tumor.
   Honecker was ousted from the leadership on Oct. 18, after
massive pro-democracy demonstrations. He was expelled from the
Communist Party in December and has since been accused of treason
and abusing his power.

<HEAD>Cleanup Crews Wrap Up Fuel Removal From Damaged TMI Reactor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a final sweep of an underwater
vacuum, workers at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant have wrapped
up the four-year effort to remove fuel from the damaged reactor.
   A color monitor inspection of the Unit 2 reactor, followed by
the vacuuming on Tuesday, marked the end of the project, said Mary
Wells, spokeswoman for GPU Nuclear Corp., which operates the plant.
   Since 1985, more than 99 percent of the 100 tons of uranium fuel
were pulled from the reactor and shipped to a federal laboratory in
Idaho for study and disposal. GPU Nuclear said fuel removal was the
heart of the $1 billion cleanup.
   Unit 2 was damaged in March 1979 in the worst accident ever at a
U.S. commercial nuclear plant. The nuclear core lost cooling water,
overheated and partially melted.
   The remaining fuel poses no hazard at the plant, which is
scheduled to go into long-term storage beginning next year, Ms.
Wells said. ``It simply could not be reached,'' she said. ``We've
gone to extraordinary efforts to get the fuel out.''
   The cleanup required development of new tools so workers on a
shielded platform above the reactor could pick up radioactive
debris through 40 feet of water.
   Decontamination work on other plant systems will continue for
the rest of the year. GPU Nuclear is working on a system to boil
away 2.3 million gallons of slightly contaminated water left from
the accident and cleanup.
   Kay Pickering, a spokeswoman for the anti-nuclear group Three
Mile Island Alert, said people shouldn't think the cleanup is
finished. ``We're concerned about what happens now,'' she said.
``Our concern is that it remains a highly radioactive site.''
   GPU Nuclear has asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to
authorize a license change permitting the long-term storage plan.
   The containment building around the reactor would be sealed and
monitored for several decades to allow radiation levels to drop.

<HEAD>China Orders Tighter Control of Unions, Mass Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's ruling Communist Party issued stern
orders today for tighter control of unions and other mass
organizations and said they cannot be used as opposition bases.
   A party circular said officials should strengthen leadership
over the unions, the Communist Youth League and women's federations
``so that these organizations keep to the correct political
orientation and identify themselves with the party Central
Committee in politics, thinking and action.''
   ``On no account is any organization allowed to raise political
advocacy against the party,'' it said. ``By no means will any
political organization opposing the four cardinal principles or
undermining state power be allowed to exist. It must be banned
according to law as soon as it is discovered.''
   The four cardinal principles of the party, set forth by senior
leader Deng Xiaoping in 1979, are socialism, the leadership of the
Communist Party, the people's democratic dictatorship and
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse-tung thought.
   The principles are stressed most in times when political
conservatives dominate policy, as they have since the June
crackdown on student-led, pro-democracy protesters.
   The circular was approved by the party Central Committee on Dec.
21, but issued publicly only today, the official Xinhua News Agency
said without giving any reason for the delay.
   It said the aim was to ``guard against and prevent any tendency
to cast off or weaken the leadership of the party.''
   All unions and mass organizations in China are set up and
supervised by the state, and the government has made it clear in
the past it will not tolerate unofficial worker federations such as
Poland's Solidarity, which became the spearhead for revolt against
Communist rule.
   Some officials of the national trade union federation openly
supported last spring's democracy movement, but the party moved
quickly to discipline them and assert its control. An independent
union formed by a group of Beijing workers during the protests was
declared illegal and its leaders were arrested.
   The Communist Youth League, a kind of junior division for young,
would-be party members, donated tents to the student protesters
camping in Tiananmen Square, and the All-China Women's Federation
joined dozens of groups in urging authorities to hold a dialogue
with students who began a hunger strike.
   The party circular said unions, the Youth League and women's
groups must ``participate in handling social contradictions,
especially unexpected public events,'' meaning they must help the
party educate their members in the official position on any event.
   They also must ``guide workers, young people and women to
subordinate their personal interests to the interest of the state.''
   Finally, they should serve as ``democratic channels for the
public to take part in and discuss state affairs in an organized
and disciplined way under leadership,'' the circular said. Deng has
said repeatedly he is opposed to Western-style democracy with
uncontrolled public debate on issues.

<TEXT>
   Major opposition parties today
denounced the revolutionary government's plan to continue governing
while competing in elections and warned that a new dictatorship
could emerge.
   Opposition groups have angrily criticized the ruling National
Salvation Front, which assumed power during the bloody December
revolt that toppled Nicolae Ceausescu, for reneging on its promise
to run Romania only until the May 20 elections.
   They had demanded the interim government not field candidates in
elections it will oversee and accused it of trying to establish
one-party rule.
   On Tuesday, the interim government said it would share power
until the elections and split into two groups _ one to govern and
the other to contest elections.
   The opposition National Liberal Party said the move failed to
answer its objections because it would still be running the
government and participating in elections.
   ``This is illegal. We asked the Front to transform itself into a
political party,'' party spokesman Nicolae Enescu told The
Associated Press. ``If it takes part in elections and represents
the interests of the state, it seems like a dictatorship again.''
   The other major opposition group, the 260,000-member National
Peasant Party, charged that if the Nationl Salvation Front wins, it
will establish another Communist dictatorship ``with a human face.''
   Critics noted that the Front controls the military, bureaucracy
and industry and has restricted opposition access to the mass media.
   Senior Front member Silviu Brucan offered the coalition
government and announced the split in comments to selected
reporters, a transcript of which was made avaliable to The
Associated Press.
   The concessions follow growing public dissatisfaction with the
Front's ruling tactics and international criticism of it for
allowing pro-government demonstrators to besiege the headquarters
of two opposition parties on Monday.
   Opposition leaders claimed they had been the target of
government-organized harassment, noting that many of the protesters
were workers who arrived in the capital in government-owned trucks
and buses.
   On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department accused the Front of
intimidating the opposition and said department human rights
director Richard Schifter was in Bucharest ``forcefully stating our
concerns.''
   ``We are deeply troubled by what appears to be active
intimidation of legitimate organizations which are seeking a
legitimate, independent role in Romania's new political order,''
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in Washington.
   Schifter met with opposition leaders Tuesday and was to confer
with key government figures today.
   The demonstrators Monday broke into Liberal Party headquarters
and surrounded the offices of the National Peasant Party, forcing
its president to flee in an armored personnel carrier provided by
authorities.
   On Sunday, thousands of protesters had converged on government
headquarters, demanding the Front share power or resign.
   Many opposition groups have accused the Front _ which is
composed of military officers, intellectuals and disaffected
Communists _ of seeking to continue Communist rule.
   Brucan declared Tuesday:
   ``We believe it is illegal for the Front to hold political power
and take part in elections at the same time.
   ``That is why we have split into a provisional National Council,
to hold legislative power on the one hand, and the National
Salvation Front, which is to take part in the elections as a
political organization, on the other.''
   He said the government would suggest opposition parties ``take
part in the provisional National Council in order to guarantee the
objectivity of the elections,'' when talks between the government
and opposition resume Thursday.
   In other developments, a military tribunal was told that
Ceausescu's defense minister, Vasile Milea, was not killed on
Ceausescu's orders as had been believed but killed himself rather
than give orders to fire on anti-Ceausescu demonstrators.
   Milea has become a hero of the Romanian revolution for trying to
keep the army from firing on unarmed demonstrators, as ordered by
Ceausescu.
   His death helped turn army units against Ceausescu in the
popular uprising that ended the dictator's brutal 24-year rule.
   At the trial of four close associates of Ceausescu, Col.
Corneliu Pircalabescu testified that Milea asked him to tell his
wife and children he couldn't order defenseless demonstrators
killed. Minutes later, he shot himself in the heart, said
Pircalabescu, head of the civilian reserve force.
   Pircalabescu is not a defendant in the trial.
   His testimony, some of the most moving in the three-day trial,
contradicted an account Monday by defendant Emil Bobu that the
dictator ordered the general's assassination for opposing the order
to shoot. Bobu was the No. 3 official in the Ceausescu government.
   The trial, which began Saturday, was adjourned until Thursday.

   A middle school was closed today after
eight students were treated for drinking water contaminated with
antifreeze that had seeped into the drinking fountains.
   The students, who complained of headaches and stomach cramps
Tuesday, were sent home after receiving hospital treatment for
ethylene glycol poisoning. Tests failed to detect any of the
substance in their bloodstreams, authorities said.
   Rodger Quist, principal at Overland Trail Middle School, said
the substance is used in the building heating system. ``It's
supposed to be self-contained,'' he said. ``But for some reason it
got pushed into our water supply.''
   He said the school would be closed today and possibly longer
while engineers try to figure out how the two systems got crossed,
correct the problem and flush the system.
   Becky Green, the school's nurse, said the water coming into the
fountains was ``murky blue-green. It was really ugly and smelly.''

   If white America is shocked by what it sees,
the newly authorized National Museum of the American Indian will be
doing its job, says Suzan Shown Harjo.
   ``But I think the white majority culture is tough enough to
understand that slavery and subjugation are not a good idea,'' says
Ms. Harjo, former executive director of the National Congress of
American Indians and a moving force in the museum's establishment.
   Ms. Harjo, 44, a Cheyenne and Creek who was born in El Reno,
Okla., is president of the Morning Star Foundation, an organization
advocating respect for the cultural rights of Indians.
   She was named Monday as one of the 12 Indians required by
Congress to be included in the 25-member board of directors of the
National Museum of the American Indian.
   The museum was authorized last year as the last Smithsonian
museum to be built on the National Mall. It will be squeezed
between the Air and Space Museum and the Capitol. A companion
museum also will be built in New York City's Custom House.
   When completed in 1992, the museum will consolidate the
Smithsonian's big Indian collection with 1 million artifacts,
40,000 books and 86,000 photos in New York City's Museum of the
American Indian, which was short of space and running low on money.
The New York collection is possibly the world's largest.
   In an interview, Ms. Harjo said the museum will acquaint white
Americans with a fresh view of history ``if I have anything to do
with it.''
   And that view may be shocking in a capital where even the name
of the professional football team _ the Washington Redskins _ is as
insulting to native Americans as other epithets would be to other
groups, she said.
   If the museum succeeds, even such a simple schoolday lesson as
``Columbus discovered America'' will have to be freshly thought
through, Ms. Harjo said.
   With a laugh, she suggested that ``America discovered Columbus''
or ``Indians had a lax immigration policy,'' would be a more
accurate way to describe what happened in 1492.
   Her point was that the continent called America was here _ and
populated by developed civilizations _ long before Columbus'
``discovery'' 500 years ago.
   ``They came, we welcomed, they killed _ short history for the
quincentennial,'' she said.
   Ms. Harjo's grievance with the way American Indians' history is
presented is that it treats them as relics. ``We are not discussed
in the present tense, therefore we have no future,'' she said.
   ``The fact is that history has never been written accurately
about native peoples,'' she said. ``It is written by the colonizer
and is designed to justify the land grabs and continued
colonization, the subjugation of a people.''
   As the result, when the Indian won a battle it was a
``massacre''; when white troops won it was a ``victory.''
   ``Telling the truth doesn't mean presenting Indians always in
the most positive light,'' Ms. Harjo said. ``It just means telling
the truth. ... We need an educational program to humanize us in a
way that will counter the dehumanizing, stereotyping and cartooning
that has taken place.''

<DATELINE>MONDOU, Chad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II traveled to the Christian
heartland of southern Chad today and paid homage to missionaries
killed during decades of civil strife.
   On the last full day of his eight-day tour of Africa's Sahel
region, the pontiff celebrated Mass before more than 100,000 people
in this capital of the cotton-growing region where Roman Catholic
missionaries set up their first base 60 years ago.
   He called Mondou ``the cradle of the Catholic church in Chad.''
   The great majority of Chad's 400,000 baptized Roman Catholics
and 153 foreign priests live in the south. Most of the nation's
Moslems, who make up about 50 percent of the population of 5.5
million, live in the north.
   In his homily, the pope paid tribute to the former bishop of
Mondou, Gabriel Balet, a Swiss national who was killed in the crash
of a French airliner in Niger on Sept. 19. The UTA DC-10 exploded
during a flight from N'Djamena to Paris. A bomb was suspected.
   ``I express again, from all my heart, my deep sympathy to the
families in mourning and to the diocesan community,'' John Paul
said, speaking in French at Mondou's Stadium of Peace.
   A highlight of the ceremony came when a chief of the Nomoate
ethnic group danced up to the altar and placed a beaded cap with
brown plumes on John Paul's head. The pope held the hat on his head
and smiled broadly.
   Since becoming independent in 1960, Chad has often been torn
apart by fighting between north and south, between different tribes
and political factions and between Libyan-backed rebels and
government forces.
   In August, Chad and Libya agreed to put an end to 16 years of
hostility and agreed to reach a political settlement over the
45,000-square-mile Aouzou Strip that separates them.
   Referring to the missionaries who evangelized Chad, the pope
said: ``Many of them, during the tragic events of these past years,
paid with their life for their attachment to Jesus and their
fidelity to the service of their community.''
   He praised the catechists who traveled to areas of fighting to
spread the faith.
   ``For this country rebuilding itself after so many ordeals,
their presence and their actions are a sign of hope,'' the pope
said before leaving to conduct a special service in Sarh and
returning to the capital, N'Djamena.
   A crowd of 150,000 to 200,000 attended the Mass in a huge open
field that is to be the site of a soccer stadium. The pope
encouraged the faithful to fill the ranks of priests and
catechists. There are only 26 Chadian priests.
   The theme of reconciliation and unity has dominated the pope's
stay in Chad.
   Repression by a Christian-led government in 1965 against Moslem
populations in the center and north of Chad led to fighting
throughout the country that ended only two years ago.
   The Chadian church has placed great emphasis on the need for an
Islamic-Christian dialogue.
   Upon arriving in Chad on Monday, the pope spoke in a cathedral
that was restored after being destroyed by fighting 10 years ago.

<TEXT>
   A political reform initiative that won
voter approval 19 months ago has wound up like many so many other
California ballot measures in recent years _ in court.
   Testimony began Tuesday in the federal court trial of
Proposition 73, the omnibus campaign cleanup measure that outlawed
public financing of political races, limited contributions, and
banned transfers of donations between candidates' committees.
   The proposition is the latest in a series of voter-approved
ballot questions _ including measures dealing with insurance rate
reform and toxics cleanup _ that have become ensnared in legal
tangles.
   Opponents of Proposition 73, led by Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown, the Democratic Party and several unions, want U.S. District
Judge Lawrence Karlton to throw out the initiative. They contend it
is unconstitutional and denies women, minorities and grass-roots
groups their rights by unfairly limiting the amount of money they
can raise to run against wealthy incumbents.
   In addition, an advocate for one of the state's most powerful
and well-heeled lobbies, the 240,000-member California Teachers
Association, testified that Proposition 73 has put a crimp in the
teachers' political activities.
   Alice Huffman, who heads the association's political action
committee that distributes hundred of thousands of dollars annually
to legislative candidates, said the measure's contribution
restraints restrict the group's contacts with its members by
limiting the number of campaign endorsement letters it can send.
   The authors of Proposition 73 said their initiative is supported
by the public and opposed only by Democratic politicians seeking to
bolster their power.
   ``Opposition is coming from some of the most powerful
politicians and special interests in California,'' said initiative
co-author Ross Johnson of Fullerton, the Republican leader of the
state Assembly. Those groups dislike provisions that apply the same
limits to all candidates, he said.
   Johnson said the initiative has hamstrung runaway campaign
donations, but critics, including the political watchdog group
Common Cause, contend the measure has had an uncertain impact on
California's high-stakes political campaigns.
   Joseph Garcia, an attorney for the state Fair Political
Practices Commission, said the lawsuit was politically motivated
and not based on merit.
   ``In this case, these facts are about politics and these
plaintiffs are politicians,'' Garcia said. ``Not here before the
court today are the three million voters who overwhelmingly
approved Proposition 73 in 1988 by 58 percent of the vote.''
   The measure was approved 3.14 million to 2.23 million votes.
   The initiative puts a $1,000 ceiling on individual contributions
to a state or local candidate in a single fiscal year, $2,500 from
a political committee and $5,000 from a so-called broad-based
political action committee or political party. The measure put no
restrictions on spending.
   On May 19, Karlton ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, issuing a
temporary order that overturned some provisions. The judge lifted
the ban on transfers between one candidate's committees, removed
the limit on labor union contributions for endorsement mailings,
and said candidates could use funds raised before Jan. 1, 1989,
when most of the provisions took effect, to back or oppose other
candidates.
   His order remains in effect pending the outcome of the trial.
   Karlton is hearing the case without a jury, and he said the
trial will probably be completed by early next week.
   Other initiatives that have resulted in court fights include
Proposition 103, the insurance reform measure backed by consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, and Proposition 65, the anti-toxics
clean-water initiative that was supported by environmentalists but
opposed by farmers and manufacturers.

<TEXT>
   Arnaud d'Usseau, a Broadway playwright and
Hollywood screenwriter who was blacklisted after a heated
confrontation with Sen. Joseph McCarthy, has died at 73.
   D'Usseau died Monday of complications of surgery for stomach
cancer in New York City, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   The author of such acclaimed plays as ``Tomorrow the World'' and
``Deep Are the Roots'' was brought before McCarthy in 1953 as the
senator investigated alleged communist influence in the film
industry.
   D'Usseau refused to answer McCarthy's questions, saying he would
be happy to debate the merits of communism and capitalism in
another setting, but not ``where you have everything stacked.''
   At one point, the Republican senator from Wisconsin threatened
to remove d'Usseau from the hearing room.
   After his blacklisting, d'Usseau wrote for films under
pseudonyms. His last play, ``Bledsoe,'' is being readied for a
Broadway opening.
   A native of Los Angeles, d'Usseau began writing professionally
in the 1930s. His films included ``One Crowded Night,'' ``Lady
Scarface,'' ``Repent at Leisure,'' ``Just Off Broadway,'' ``The Man
Who Wouldn't Die'' and ``Who Is Hope Schuyler?''
   In 1944, Ring Lardner Jr., who became one of the so-called
Hollywood 10 group of writers and directors who went to prison for
their defiance of the congressional investigations of alleged
communist influence, adapted d'Usseau's ``Tomorrow the World'' for
the screen.
   Considered among the most literate of the wartime propaganda
works, ``Tomorrow the World'' was about a German boy adopted by an
American couple.
   In 1945, d'Usseau and his writing partner, James Gow, created
``Deep Are the Roots,'' which explored the then-controversial theme
of miscegenation as it pleaded for racial tolerance.
   D'Usseau's other Broadway plays included ``Ladies of the
Corridor,'' written with Dorothy Parker, and ``The Legend of
Sarah'' with Gow in 1950.
   D'Usseau lived in New York and taught writing at New York
University and the School of Visual Arts.
   Survivors include his wife, Marie, a son, a daughter and three
brothers.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

<TEXT>
   President Bush may not outshine ``a thousand
points of light'' or top ``a kinder and gentler nation,'' but he's
bound to try out a new catch-phrase or two in tonight's State of
the Union address.
   Presidential speechwriters always strive for those few pithy
words or flowing lines that will live on after the applause has
died.
   But the ghostwriter who put those earlier words in Bush's mouth
and taught us to read his lips, Peggy Noonan, is now persona non
grata at the White House since becoming a tell-it-all author. And
neither Bush, left to his own devices, nor his current
speechwriters have been having much luck at matching the old Noonan
nuggets.
   ``The underpinnings of the United States, the State of the
Union, is not bad,'' Bush told a group of newspaper publishers last
week when asked to preview tonight's address.
   ``Not bad,'' might be an honest assessment. But it doesn't have
much ring.
   Meanwhile, Bush's speechwriters seem to be straining for soaring
passages.
   ``With all the flash and fluff in the world today, there's
something we can't afford to lose sight of _ something deceptively
simple. It's who we are that makes this nation what it is,'' was
one recent offering.
   In his 1989 inaugural address, Bush spoke lyrically of a ``new
breeze'' blowing through the totalitarian world. He promised
Democratic leaders an ``age of the offered hand.'' And he summed up
the nation's budget woes in six words: ``We have more will than
wallet.''
   Noonan, again.
   It was the last speech she wrote for George Bush. White House
sources said there was a falling out between Noonan and White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu and other top Bush advisers in early
1989, partly due to her own growing fame as a wordsmith.
   Noonan recounts her experiences as a speechwriter for Bush and
former President Reagan in a book, ``What I Saw at the Revolution:
A Political Life in the Reagan Era,'' published last week.
   Bush has made no secret of his disdain for insider or
``kiss-and-tell'' books written by former aides. The publication of
Noonan's book did little to heal the rift.
   When she began writing speeches for Bush in the 1988 campaign,
Noonan writes, he gave her a list of words with ``special meaning''
to him: ``family, grandkids, love, decency, honor, pride,
tolerance, hope, kindness, loyalty, freedom, caring, heart, faith,
service to country, fair (fair play), strength, healing,
excellence.''
   From those threads she began weaving Bush's speeches. But she
ran up against one major obstacle: ``George Bush hated to say `I.'''
   ``I became adept at pronounless sentences,'' Noonan says.
``Instead of `I moved to Texas and soon we joined the Republican
party,' it was `Moved to Texas, joined the Republican party, raised
a family.'''
   Noonan suggests Bush's modesty came from his ``doughty old
mom,'' Dorothy Walker Bush, ``who used to rap his knuckles for
bragging, a brag apparently being defined as any sentence with the
first person singular as its subject.''
   She confesses visions of Bush taking the oath on the Capitol
steps with these words: ``Do solemnly swear, will preserve and
protect ...'''
   Bush's characterization of a ``kinder, gentler nation,''
contained in his acceptance speech to the Republican National
Convention, has become one of the president's signature phrases.
But, Noonan writes, it was just ``kinder nation'' in her first
draft. She later scribbled in ``gentler.''
   Bush's ``no new taxes'' line, also in the same widely acclaimed
acceptance speech, was suggested by Jack Kemp, now the secretary of
Housing and Urban Development, Noonan says.
   But she takes all the credit for ``read my lips,'' even though
Bush aides took it out because ``there is no history of
presidential candidates making personal-organ references in
acceptance speeches.''
   Bush left it in. One line he scratched out: a reference Noonan
proposed to Michael Dukakis' slight stature.
   Noonan claims full credit for Bush's ``thousand points of
light,'' but allows it might have been influenced by a line from a
favorite author, Thomas Wolfe, who wrote in ``The Web and the
Rock'' of a ``thousand points of friendly light.''
   Bush uses the phrase to this day to praise volunteer efforts.
   Why a thousand? ``A hundred wasn't enough and a million is too
many,'' Noonan writes.
   White House communications director David Demarest, in charge of
White House speechwriters, says Noonan, who now lives in New York,
has not worked on any recent Bush speeches and that all
presidential speeches are prepared in-house.
   However, work on Bush's State of the Union address was partly
farmed out to an old hand from the campaign: New York media
consultant and image guru Roger Ailes.
   White House speechwriter Daniel McGroarty wrote most of the
speech and White House chief of staff Sununu helped refine it.
Ailes worked with Bush on Monday and again today on final
preparation, sources said.

<TEXT>
   An American soldier who fled to East Germany
in 1959 for fear a truck accident would land him in the stockade
saw his family for the first time in three decades _ then was taken
away as an Army deserter.
   Military and Omaha police were awaiting Arnold Kephart when he
landed at Omaha's airport Tuesday. He saw his 86-year-old father
and a sister momentarily before being led away on the 30-year-old
warrant for desertion in West Germany.
   Kephart, 53, originally from Langdon, Mo., had escaped to the
East bloc with a girlfriend and wasn't able to return to the West
until December, after East Germany threw open its borders, said his
attorney, James Martin Davis.
   In his 30 years behind the Iron Curtain, Kephart worked as a
truck driver in the small city of Smalkalden, married twice and
fathered a son, now 12, of whom he has custody. The boy, Frankie,
came with him and is staying with his father's family.
   Kephart was expected to be taken to Fort Riley, Kan., today,
Davis said.
   Tracy Andersen of Council Bluffs, one of Kephart's nieces, said
she and about 30 family members came to Omaha's Eppley Airfield to
meet Kephart and his son.
   Instead, they discovered that Kephart had been arrested by
military police on the plane and taken into the airport by a side
entrance. He was allowed to speak only to his father, Ernest
Kephart, and sister, Mary Hartman, Anderson said.
   ``They just let them talk a little bit, and she came out with
the boy,'' Kephart's niece said.
   Davis said Kephart was a corporal in Heidelberg in 1959 when he
crashed a truck and was told by a sergeant that he would be thrown
in the stockade and would have to pay for the vehicle on a
$69-per-month salary, Davis said.
   The staff sergeant lied, but Kephart believed him, the attorney
said. During the next three decades, Kephart tried to escape to the
West three or four times but was caught at the border, Davis said.
Only three or four censored letters reached his family.
   Kephart received custody of Frankie after divorcing his second
wife. After the opening of the borders to the West late last year,
Kephart and his son walked 300 miles for several weeks, eating out
of garbage cans, Davis said.
   He got to Hamburg Dec. 15 and worked in a hotel until he was
able to locate his family and obtain proof of U.S. citizenship and
a passport, the lawyer said.
   ``He has a great difficulty speaking English,'' Davis said. ``He
will frequently lapse into German. Every three of four sentences he
will say that he does not know the word in English.''

   Thousands of black demonstrators
in two cities today peacefully protested police tactics and a
boycott-breaking tour by English cricket players.
   Seeking to avoid a repeat of violence that marred previous
unauthorized protests, the government authorized the two
demonstrations _ a march in Cape Town protesting alleged police
brutality and a rally in Bloemfontein outside the stadium where the
English team was playing.
   Large police contingents watched the protests, but there were no
reports of disturbances.
   In Cape Town, 3,500 marchers met at a Methodist church, then
walked to police headquarters to present a petition condemning
police actions during a protest march in the city on Jan. 23.
   Police had blocked the intended parade route with barbed wire,
then used rubber bullets and a water cannon against the protesters,
sparking a rampage in which scores of youths smashed windows of
shops and cars.
   By contrast, today's march was peaceful.
   ``It has shown very clearly that if there is any violence or
disorderly conduct, it is entirely the fault of the police,'' said
the Rev. Allan Boesak, a prominent mixed-race activist who led the
march.
   The government gave permission for another protest march in Cape
Town on Thursday, organized to demand that President F.W. de Klerk
appoint a commission to investigate allegations about police
assassination squads.
   In Bloemfontein, 1,000 blacks arrived by bus and van to protest
the English cricket team, which was in the second day of a
three-day match against a team of university players.
   Among the spectators in the stadium were scores of black youths
who had been given tickets by a group supporting the tour.
   The English players face bans of five years from international
competition for making the trip in defiance of the sports boycott
imposed to protest South Africa's racial segregation policies.
   Since the team's arrival two weeks ago, there have been repeated
clashes between police and protesters. On Tuesday, police used
batons, rubber bullets and tear gas to prevent 1,000 blacks from
marching to the stadium.
   Some demonstrators threw stones at police vehicles and erected
burning tire barricades in the streets of Mangaung township.
   Obed Nkosi, an organizer for the anti-apartheid National Sports
Council, said 30 people were hurt. Police said 45 people were
arrested and one white businessman was slightly injured when his
vehicle was stoned by protesters.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Uptown, the cigarette that was to
have been aimed at blacks, will probably never rise from the ashes,
says the chairman of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
   Reynolds had planned to test-market the new cigarette in
Philadelphia beginning Feb. 5 but canceled out last week after the
product was criticized by civic groups and Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, who is black.
   ``I doubt you will see Uptown on the market again,'' Reynolds
chairman James W. Johnston said in a speech to local business
leaders Tuesday.
   ``We made the decision because the issue was being turned from a
smoking issue, which it is, to a racial issue. And we did not feel
that was the kind of ground we wanted to have a dispute on.''

<TEXT>
   Deputy premier Frantisek Pitra,
the last of the Old Guard Communist leaders left in power after the
peaceful revolution, resigned today as leader of the Czech
republic, the CTK news agency said.
   It was expected Pitra also would give up his Cabinet position
once his resignation from the Czech post was approved by Parliament.
   Pitra, 57, had strong links with the orthodox Communist
leadership that took over after the crushing of the 1968 reform
movement and ruled until last fall's pro-democracy revolution.
   Pitra lost his seat on the ruling Communist Party Politburo on
Nov. 24, along with hard-line party leader Milos Jakes and others
closely linked to the post-1968 crackdown.
   However, he survived as Czech premier after revamping his
republic's government to become the first in Czechoslovakia since
1948 that was not dominated by Communists.
   That paved the way for similar changes at the federal level.
   Pitra's position as the Czech premier automatically gave him the
deputy premier's post in the national government.
   CTK did not give the reason for Pitra's resignation, which came
a day after the Communists ended a 40-year dominance in the
national Parliament by relinquishing more than 100 of their seats
to pro-democracy groups.
   The realignment completed an effort to include Czechoslovakia's
emerging reform groups in Parliament before free elections, which
are scheduled June 8.
   Parliament swore in 120 new deputies Tuesday, only nine of them
Communists, under an agreement to replace more than one-third of
the 350-member legislature.
   The action sliced the Communists' representation from 242 to
139. Nearly all the new seats went to the opposition and other
established political parties.
   More than 40 political parties have emerged in the two months
since Parliament removed the constitutional provision guaranteeing
the Communist Party's leading role.
   In other developments, Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier today
met with a papal representative on restoring ties between
Czechoslovakia and the Vatican, and state radio announced plans to
resume broadcasting Masses and other religious programs.
   Dienstbier, meeting with special Papal Nuncio Archbishop
Francesco Colasuonno, also discussed the visit of Polish-born Pope
John Paul II, planned for April 21-22 as the new government seeks
to restore sanctioned religious observances following decades of
repression.
   The official CTK news agency said the talks concerned ``the
early resumption'' of diplomatic relations between Czechoslovakia
and the Vatican. Czechoslovakia broke ties in the 1950s in line
with Communist dogma followed throughout the East bloc.
   Poland last year became the first East bloc nation to restore
diplomatic ties with the Vatican.
   Last week, the Czechoslovak Parliament said priests no longer
will have to obtain licenses from the state. The licenses had been
used in the past to screen clergymen considered politically
troublesome.
   Czechoslovakia and Israel are expected to restore diplomatic
ties on Feb. 8, when Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel visits
Prague.
   Czechoslovakia, one of Israel's strongest supporters after the
Jewish state was founded in 1948, broke ties after the 1967 Middle
East war, when Israel captured Arab lands.

   Detectives staked out a newspaper box and
nabbed three people for taking more copies than they paid for,
authorities said.
   The stakeout Tuesday was requested by the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette because of an increase in complaints of thefts.
   Pedestrians stared and a Post-Gazette reporter took notes while
detectives read the three their rights. Photos of the three were
published in today's paper with captions such as ``Had two papers''
and ``4 Post-Gazettes, 4 USA Todays.''
   One of those arrested took two newspapers after putting in just
one quarter, authorities said.
   Each of the three was offered a choice of being charged with
retail theft or enrolling in a $50 course on the evils of
shoplifting. All three enrolled.
   Jim Logan, assistant city circulation manager, said that in an
average week downtown 1,500 Post-Gazettes are stolen, or $19,500 in
revenue a year.
   Logan said the money lost to theft must be paid by the route
manager who handles the box. ``People think they're stealing from a
corporation or a metal box,'' he said. ``They don't know they're
stealing from a person.''

<TEXT>
   A black man accused of
involvement in guerrilla attacks was found hanged in his cell,
police said today. He reportedly was a former lover of jailed black
leader Nelson Mandela's daughter.
   Within hours of the police announcement, President F.W. de Klerk
ordered a judicial inquiry into the death, a step not taken after
scores of previous incidents in which black activists died while in
police custody.
   According to local newspapers, the 20-year-old man, Clayton
Sithole, was a former lover of Zindzi Mandela and the father of her
child.
   There was no immediate comment from the Mandelas, but associates
of the family said they believed the report was accurate.
   Sithole and four other suspected African National Congress
guerrillas were arrested Friday in Soweto, the vast black township
outside Johannesburg. Police accused the group of killing 10
people, including two policemen, in attacks with hand grenades and
automatic rifles over the past two years.
   Police said Sithole was found hanging from a shower pipe Tuesday
in his cell at John Vorster Square, Johannesburg's central police
station. The police said an investigation into the death had
started and would include a post mortem by a state pathologist.
   Within a few hours of the police statement, Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok announced that de Klerk had appointed an
inquiry commission headed by a judge to investigate Sithole's death.
   Neither Vlok nor de Klerk gave any indication whether the
decision was related to the reported connection to the Mandela
family. Mandela, 71, is widely expected to be freed within the next
few weeks after more than 27 years in prison for his role in
planning the start of the ANC's guerrilla campaign.
   Audrey Coleman, a prominent human rights activist, welcomed de
Klerk's move, saying she could not recall such a swift and emphatic
response to any of the scores of other deaths of detainees which
she has monitored in recent years.
   She said Sithole's family, who suspected the young man had been
mistreated, would hire a pathologist of their own to conduct an
independent post mortem Thursday.
   Police said Sithole had made a confession to a magistrate prior
to his death, implicating himself in several killings.
   About 100 ANC guerrillas and anti-apartheid activists have died
in police custody in the past 25 years. According to police,
suicide by hanging has been the most common cause of these deaths,
but human rights groups have insisted that many of these prisoners
had been mistreated by interrogators.
   In announcing the arrests Monday, police headquarters said
officers had seized an arms cache that included a Soviet-made
automatic rifle, a revolver and 27 rounds of ammunition.
   The African National Congress was outlawed in 1960 and the next
year began a bombing and sabotage campaign intended to undermine
the white-minority government.
   The guerrilla campaign has slackened in the past two years, with
a marked decrease in the number of bombings in which civilians
could be at risk. During this period, however, black policemen have
remained a frequent ANC target.
   Police said in their daily unrest report today that a policeman
was among three people killed in political violence in black
townships around the port city of Durban. The report gave no
details.
   Police headquarters confirmed that a prominent black activist,
Peter Mokaba, had been detained last weekend under the Internal
Security Act, which allows indefinite detention for interrogation
purposes.
   Mokaba is a leader of the militant South African Youth Congress
and a close associate of Winnie Mandela, wife of jailed ANC leader
Nelson Mandela.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today denied a U.S.
broadcast report that he is considering resigning his post as
Communist Party chief.
   ``No one has said this, and I certainly didn't make any such
statement,'' the Soviet president and party general secretary said.
``Any such suggestions are groundless.''
   The Cable News Network reported Tuesday, quoting an unidentified
party source, that Gorbachev had spent eight days holed up at his
country house outside Moscow with his top advisers, where he was
considering resigning his leaderhip of the party.
   The source was quoted as saying Gorbachev would have retained
the presidency, a government position he proposes to convert from a
largely ceremonial post to a substantive one.
   ``I have no intention of doing so,'' Gorbachev said when asked
about the report during a photo session at the start of a Kremlin
meeting with President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, speaking at a
regular news briefing, also denied the CNN report.
   President Bush today phoned Gorbachev to discuss arms control
and other issues. Asked if the two discussed the CNN report, White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The president said there
was no direct discussion of that.''
   The official Tass news agency said the two leaders discussed
international affairs, the situation in Europe and arms control. It
did not say if Bush asked Gorbachev whether he intended to resign
as party chief.
   In a related discussion published in the Communist Party daily
Pravda, four scholars urged that the presidency be strengthened to
protect the head of state from efforts to oust him and allow him to
act more decisively.
   The discussion in Pravda appeared aimed at telling readers that
party power still is paramount and that the presidency is not
strong enough to be the country's main leadership post.
   Historian Yevgeny Ambartsumov said in Pravda that Gorbachev
appeared unable to take decisive action because of the threat to
his position.
   The CNN report touched off a temporary flurry of selling on
Western stock markets and sent the dollar soaring in New York and
Japan.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said he did not know how
to respond to what he termed ``a rumor.''
   The ruling Communist Party has traditionally been the power base
for Soviet leaders. However, the party has been widely blamed for
failing to solve the country's dire economic crisis, and reformist
lawmakers are demanding that the Communists give up their monopoly
on power.
   The presidency has become a more visible and substantive
position in recent months. Still, there is little question that the
party's Politburo and Central Committee retain the political power.
   Gorbachev told journalists he had just returned from the south,
apparently referring to his retreat on the Black Sea, where he was
preparing for next week's meeting of the Communist Party's
governing Central Committee, which is planning a potential critical
party congress for the fall.
   The meeting comes at a time of political turmoil for Gorbachev
and the ruling Communists. The breakaway Lithuanian Communist Party
rejected Gorbachev's efforts to bring it back within the fold, and
the president was forced to send troops into the warring southern
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan to restore order and crush an
effort by Azerbaijani nationalists to seize power in Baku.
   The rumor about Gorbachev's stepping down was fed by an
announcement that Baker was again postponing by a day his scheduled
two-day trip to Moscow for talks with Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and, almost certainly, Gorbachev as well. Initially,
Baker was to go to Moscow on Feb. 6. On Tuesday, the State
Department said it had suggested the visit begin on Feb. 8.
   Shevardnadze told The Associated Press in an interview last week
there is widespread concern in the West that Gorbachev may not
survive politically. But he attributed it more to a desire that
Gorbachev's reforms succeed than to any real threat to the Soviet
leader's political power.
   ``I believe that this particular preoccupation stems from
sincere feelings, from sincere support for the process of
perestroika that is under way in the Soviet Union,'' Shevardnadze
said. ``He was the one who spearheaded this arduous but holy
struggle.''
   Baker, asked about the rumor on Tuesday, told reporters: ``We're
following the story, as I know you are, and we'll have a comment if
we ever determine it's something more than just a rumor.''
   Baker said American diplomats in Moscow ``know just about the
same thing that all the rest of us know right now _ that there's a
rumor out there to this effect, and that's all we know.''
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told reporters Tuesday
that the administration has been ``trying for the last few hours to
try and get some additional assessments, but I don't have anything
at all.''

   The United States will absolve 10 African

International Development announced today.
   The countries are pursuing economic reform programs approved by
the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank.
   They are: Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Madagascar,
Malawi, Mali, Nigeria and Zaire.
   In some cases there will be further relief extended in stages,
an AID statement said. Three other countries eligible for relief _
Ivory Coast, Niger and Uganda _ have not concluded agreements with
the United States.
   Together, they would boost the forgiven debt relief to $745
million.
   Sub-Saharan African countries owe the U.S. government $6.5
billion, including $1.5 billion for economic assistance loans.

   A school bus whose driver momentarily took
his eyes off the road to look through the rear-view mirror plowed
into two trees, injuring the driver and all but two of the 38
children aboard, authorities said today.
   Eighteen of the children were hospitalized after Tuesday's
accident, six in critical or serious condition with head injuries,
officials said.
   The bus, carrying kindergarteners and first-graders from the
Harriman Heights Road Elementary School, sheared off its roof in
the accident.
   State Trooper Robert Gillespie said the bus slipped into the
muddy shoulder apparently after the driver took his eyes off the
road for a moment.
   The driver, Andrew Callahan, 63, was listed in fair condition
with head injuries today.
   Gillespie said State Police would consult with the district
attorney today on whether to bring charges against Callahan.
   Callahan is a 23-year veteran of the district's routes and had
never had an accident, said Cliff Berchtold, Monroe-Woodbury
district transportation director.
   ``I was going home and the bus went into the ditch and I hit the
seat with my head a couple of times,'' said Martin Polignone, 6,
who had a bump on his head and a bruise under his eye.
   ``I fell into the mud head first,'' said 6-year-old Kristin
Aspinwall. ``He (the driver) moved over and the wheel got off the
road and the bus tipped over and the whole roof came off.''
   The bus, which lacked passenger seat belts, was built a year
before state law required them in 1986.
   The school was closed today, and Louis Ciota, assistant
superintendent, said crisis counselors would be made available to
students and parents.

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin today ordered a
temporary halt to the expulsion of Palestinians living in the
occupied territories without residency permits, a practice that has
torn apart hundreds of families.
   The announcement, which cited humanitarian reasons, came a day
after the U.S. State Department expressed concern over the
expulsions.
   Palestinian activists claim the expulsions have been stepped up
and are part of a long-term strategy to force Palestinians out of
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli authority has claimed hundreds of lives
over the last 26 months.
   Israeli officials deny the claim.
   According to an army official, 251 Palestinians, including 88
women and 78 children, were expelled from the occupied lands in the
past year because they did not have residency permits.
   The official did not have figures for preceding years.
   Rabin told reporters today he decided to stop expulsions and
review the policy to prevent ``a case in which half a family will
be forced out while another part will be allowed to stay.''
   He indicated, however, that expulsions would resume. ``We cannot
afford, in principle, that a person who comes as a tourist or as a
visitor, takes the liberty to stay forever,'' he said.
   The army-run government in the occupied lands has adopted
stringent residency regulations under which only Palestinians who
lived in the occupied lands during a September 1967 census are
automatically eligible for permits.
   Others must apply for permits, and the vast majority of
applications are turned down.
   Rabin told Parliament Tuesday that since 1967, military
officials have received 88,429 requests for ``family
reunification'' and that 13,509 of those were granted.
   The group most affected is Palestinian women whose families fled
to Jordan when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967
Middle East war, and who later married men from the occupied lands.
   Inevitably, these women and their children become part of the
demographic war between Israel and the Palestinians.
   Some Palestinians see increasing their numbers as a way to give
weight to their argument for statehood. At the same time, Israel
wants to limit the number of Arabs under its control.
   Wives denied residency permits usually enter the occupied lands
on three-month visitor visas, and then face the choice of leaving
their families and returning to Jordan or staying illegally.
   Palestinian human rights groups have said that in the past few
months, soldiers have raided several remote West Bank villages to
round up illegal residents, placed them in taxis and escorted them
to the Allenby Bridge which links Jordan and the West Bank.
   ``The expulsions universally take place in the middle of the
night, with no immediate warning,'' wrote the Palestinian news
service Sanabel, which published details of several cases.
   Rabin's announcement of freezing the expulsions came after
Statement Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Tuesday
that Israeli officials are ``well aware of our concern,
particularly with regard to divided families.''
   The swift Israeli response came at a time when U.S.-Israeli
relations are strained over differences on how to make peace with
Palestinians and when some American politicians are urging cuts in
aid to the Jewish state.
   Also today, Arab activists stabbed to death a Palestinian
suspect of collaborating with Israel, and Israeli soldiers shot and
wounded three Palestinians in the occupied territories, Arab
reports said.
   A strike ordered by the PLO-linked underground leadership of the
uprising brought transportation to a halt and kept students out of
school.
   The death of 35-year-old Adwa Aziz El Masri, a taxi driver,
brought to 175 the number of Palestinians killed after being
accused of collaborating with Israel. At least 651 Palestinians
have died of Israeli gunfire during the rebellion, and 43 Israelis
have been slain.

<TEXT>
   The government today accused Pakistan of
encouraging terrorism and subversion in Kashmir where Indian
security forces are trying to put down a Moslem rebellion.
   Pakistan's Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan on Tuesday
accused India of trying to ``supress the freedom movement in
Kashmir through atrocities.'' Khan's speech was broadcast by
national radio and television.
   An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Aftab Seth, said Khan's
statements were ``deliberately fallacious'' and amounted to
``direct incitement to subversion, violence and terrorist activties
in a part of India.''
   The Indian government faces a violent Islamic separatist
movement in Kashmir that has grown more strident in the past two
months. In an effort to end the rebellion, Indian troops and police
launched a crackdown Jan. 20.
   At least 72 people, most of them Moslem protesters shot by
Indian security forces, were killed in Kashmir between Jan. 20 and
Jan. 25, according to figures compiled from government spokesmen,
police sources and witnesses. The government says there have been
no deaths since Jan. 25.
   Khan had claimed in his speech that thousands of Kashmiris were
being detained and hundreds have died in the crackdown.
   India has often accused Pakistan of aiding the militants in
order to annex the Kashmir Valley, a predominantly Moslem region
sandwiched between northwestern India and northeastern Pakistan.
India and Pakistan fought wars in 1965 and 1971 over border
disputes in the region.
   Pakistan denies helping the militants but says it supports
Kashmiri separatism, calling it a movement for self-determination.
   Seth said Khan's speech indicated that ``his government persists
in its efforts to involve itself in our internal affairs. We would
like to firmly reiterate that Kashmir is and will continue to be an
integral part of India.''
   A portion of Kashmir has been under dispute since 1947 when
India and Pakistan were partitioned on gaining independence from
Britain. India controls most of the mountainous region, and
Pakistan occupies a smaller sector.
   Seth said ``the only issue that remains to be resolved in
Kashmir is the vacation by Pakistan of territory illegally occupied
by it.'' He said Khan's efforts to justify Pakistani policies will
fuel tension in Kashmir.
   Kashmiri separatists, who earlier demanded union of Kashmir with
Pakistan, now demand independence and the formation of a neutral
country.

   A car bomb exploded in Afghanistan's
capital today, killing six people and injuring 122, official Radio
Kabul said.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, but the
report, monitored in Islamabad, blamed U.S.-supported Moslem rebels.
   The explosion destroyed several nearby cars in central Kabul and
damaged buildings within a 220-yard radius of the car bomb, the
report said.
   Most of the injured were hit by shattered window panes.
   The Moslem rebels have been fighting Soviet-backed governments
in Afghanistan for 10 years. They control most of the countryside
and regularly attack government-held Kabul with rockets and other
explosives.
   The Soviet Union completed its troop withdrawl in February 1989,
but Moscow continues to supply the government with arms and food.

<HEAD>Study: Blood Pressure Drug May Reduce Hip Fractures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Older people who take one variety of commonly used
blood pressure pills called diuretics may reduce their risk of hip
fractures by one-third, according to a study.
   The study found that people over 65 who used the type of
diuretics known as thiazides appeared to suffer significantly fewer
broken hips than nonusers.
   They said that if the medicines work the way they believe,
21,600 hip fractures might be avoided annually if all older
Americans took the medicine.
   However, they cautioned that more study will be needed before
the drugs could be prescribed solely to prevent fractures. They
said experts will have to be sure that the benefits of this
treatment outweigh the potential hazards.
   Experts long have known that thiazides can prevent the body from
losing calcium. However, the medicines also can have unwanted side
effects, including potassium deficiency and high cholesterol.
   The study, directed by Dr. Andrea Z. LaCroix of the Group Health
Cooperative of Puget Sound, was published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine.
   The study was based on a four-year follow-up of 9,518 men and
women who lived in Boston, New Haven, Conn., and rural Iowa. When
the study began, about one-quarter of them were taking thiazide
diuretics for high blood pressure.

equipment, hoses and records, Fire Chief Eddie Joe Meredith said.
   ``Everything we had is gone,'' Meredith said. ``I'd cry if it
would help.''
   He said firefighters couldn't retrieve any equipment because
they couldn't get through the electrically operated doors. They
broke through a wall to try to save their records, but flames beat
them to the filing cabinet.
   Meredith said several neighboring departments tried to save the
building.
   The department was building a third truck, with help from the
Delaplaine High School's shop program, but Meredith said it's not
ready for service yet.
   He declined to speculate on the cause of the fire. He said the
building was insured for $25,000 and the two trucks for $13,000
each.

   Up to 5 feet of snow blanketed parts
of South Korea on Wednesday, paralyzing traffic in the capital and
isolating villages.
   No weather-related deaths had been reported as of late Wednesday
but weathermen posted severe snow warnings for the entire nation.
They forecast 4 to 8 inches of new snow by Thursday.
   Kimpo International Airport outside Seoul stayed open but six
domestic airports along the east and southern coasts were closed.
All outbound inter-city buses from Seoul were canceled.
   Thousands of boats were forced to take shelter in port beause of
high waves churned by gale-force winds, maritime police said.
   More than 9.8 inches of snow accumulated in Seoul by Wednesday,
snarling traffic on icy streets.
   The east coast was hit hardest with 5 feet of snow that cut off
mountain roads collapsed dozens of slate roofs.
   In Seoul, subways were overcrowded and vehicular traffic moved
at a snail's pace. All government workers were asked to report to
work an hour late to try to reduce congestion. About 3,000 city
employees were mobilized to control traffic and clear streets of
snow.

<TEXT>
   More than 100,000 Slavs, some firing
guns in the air, demonstrated in at least three Yugoslav cities
today to demand a halt to protests by ethnic Albanians in the
ethnically troubled province of Kosovo.
   New protests by Albanians were reported today in at least five
Kosovo cities, a day after unrest claimed five lives.
   A speaker at the biggest anti-Albanian rally, in the capital of
the Montenegrin republic, said volunteers were signing up to fight
ethnic Albanians themselves unless authorities ``use all available
methods, including repression'' to end ``the Albanian uprising.''
   Belgrade television showed footage of the huge rally in
Titograd. The commentator estimated the crowd at 100,000.
   In the Montenegrin town of Ivangrad, 10,000 people demonstrated
against ``Albanian separatists and Slovenian and Croatian leaders
supporting them,'' the official Tanjug news agency reported.
   The reformist leaders of the republics of Slovenia and Croatia
have supported the ethnic Albanians' demands for more autonomy in
Kosovo.
   In Belgrade, the federal capital, tens of thousands of people
rallied in what also was billed as a demonstration against the
ethnic Albanians. But shouts of ``Down with Communism'' also were
heard.
   Earlier, 5,000 students gathered outside Parliament in Belgrade
demanding weapons to defend Slavs in Kosovo, where five people were
reported killed in clashes Tuesday between the ethnic Albanian
majority and police.
   Official media said the situation in Kosovo was approaching
civil war. Since the latest clashes broke out Jan. 24, official
media have reported 13 deaths.
   The Albanians want to regain the autonomy lost when the Serbian
republic took control of Kosovo's police, judiciary and education
last year. Kosovo is a province within Serbia and borders Albania.
   The Slav minority, which includes Serbs and Montenegrins,
contends the Albanians were trying to force them from their
homeland and that increased control over the region was necessary.
   Belgrade radio said today that at Vucitrn, 20 miles northwest of
the Kosovo capital of Pristina, five demonstrators sustained
unspecified injuries, apparently in clashes with police.
   About 3,000 demonstrators assembled in Podujevo, the scene of a
major clash Tuesday, and approximately 1,000 others rallied at
Streoci.
   Police used tear gas to prevent 200 demonstrators from joining
another crowd of protesters on the streets of Titova Mitrovica, and
an unspecified number of protesters rallied in Ada.
   At Malisevo, where two deaths were reported Tuesday, thousands
of ethnic Albanians turned out for the funerals of three of their
brethren killed in the unrest.
   The students in Belgrade proclaimed a general strike and
demanded the resignation of the ``highest organs of the
federation'' unless what they termed ``nationalist and vandalist
rioting of (ethnic Albanian) terrorists'' in Kosovo is not halted
within 48 hours.
   ``We shall give our lives, but not Kosovo!'' they chanted.
   They also chanted ``Hang Azem Vlasi!'' referring to the former
Communist leader of Kosovo who is on trial for allegedly inciting
ethnic Albanians to riot nearly a year ago.
   ``Kosovo is closer to civil war that it was ever before,'' said
the Oslobodjenje daily in the city of Sarajevo. ``Whether Kosovo
will become even bloodier is a question which no one can answer.
The situation is dramatic and uncertain, and it is hard to predict
what will take place within an hour or two, not to mention
tomorrow.''
   The pro-Serb Communist leadership of the Kosovo town of Titova
Mitrovica said, ``Unless steps are taken for suppression and
protection from terrorist actions of Albanian nationalists and
separatists, the situation threatens to grow into civil war.''
   Serbs and ethnic Albanians were reported confronting each other
in the town of Kosovska Vitina on Tuesday, the first time this has
happened.
   A number of Serbian villages have organized vigilante patrols
armed with shotguns and pistols.

   The National, the nation's only all-sports
daily, hit the newsstands today, tempting sports-hungry Americans
with a 48-page menu that included everthing from statistics to
gossip, ``jock stocks'' and a weather map.
   The 50-cent tabloid was distributed to vendors in New York, Los
Angeles and Chicago. Plans are to expand to other big cities such
as Detroit, Dallas, Philadelphia, Boston and San Francisco, with a
target of 15 cities by the end of 1990.
   Publisher Peter O. Price and Editor Frank Deford said at a news
conference that the first issue got out with few glitches. Price
said about 250,000 copies were distributed and that he had been
told many New York newsstands sold out fairly quickly.
   Price conceded that there was a ``novelty effect'' to the
first-day sales but said he was convinced there was ``immense
demand'' for the paper anyway. Deford said he expects the paper to
be so successful that someone may try to imitate it.
   The National is owned by National American Sports Communications
L.P., a partnership that includes Price and Mexican media baron
Emilio Azcarraga. Deford, a former Sports Illustrated writer, heads
the 125-person editorial staff.
   While initial sales plans are limited to single-copy sales at
newstands and in vending boxes, Deford said the paper hopes to
offer mail-delivery subscriptions later this year so more people
can get it.
   With a startup cost of $25 million, the partnership has
acknowledged that it may take several years before the newspaper
turns a profit. Price said Azcarraga was prepared to spend $100
million to put it in the black.
   Today's edition contained 36 pages of editorial material and 12
of advertisements, many of them color. Among the advertisers were
CBS Sports, MCI Communications, Toyota, the Trump Shuttle and Nike,
whose centerfold ad read: ``Halftime.''
   Inside were a variety of stories, analysis, color photos and
slickly presented statistics.
   The weather map detailed conditions in cities where games and
other sporting events are being held. A ``playground'' section
featured a crossword puzzle and comics. The paper also included a
gossip column and even a brief listing of stocks of sports-oriented
companies, labeled ``jock stocks.''
   The newspaper claimed two ``exclusives'' _ one dealing with
rightfielder Darryl Strawberry threatening to leave the Mets and
the other reporting Florida running back Emmitt Smith's decision to
turn pro.
   News outside the sporting arena was not totally ignored. The
first issue devoted a half page to the ``Real World,'' led by a
brief story on the rumor that Mikhail Gorbachev plans to resign his
post as leader of the Soviet Communist Party. The ``real'' news
also featured briefs on Zsa Zsa Gabor and Bob Dylan.
   The paper is being published Sunday through Friday.

   Fire broke out aboard a ferry carrying 285 people
across the stormy Irish Sea today, but the blaze was brought under
control by firefighters who were airlifted to the vessel, the coast
guard said.
   No injuries reported, and passengers remained on board rather
than be evacuated by helicopter, said Sealink U.K. Ltd., the ship's
owner.
   ``There is no danger to passengers or anyone on board,'' said a
spokesman for Sealink, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom. ``It was quickly contained, the fire, fortunately.''
   The fire in the engine room was put out by 14 firemen who were
airlifted by three helicopters to the 8,000-ton ferry, the St.
Columba.
   The ferry drifted without engine power in gale-force winds 12
miles off the Welsh coast before a tugboat arrived and began towing
it to the port of Holyhead. A coast guard lifeboat and helicopters
escorted the tugboat and ferry, with passengers, crew and
firefighters on board, on the four-hour trip to shore.
   ``The winds don't make it any easier,'' said a coast guard
spokesman, who was not identified in keeping with British custom.
   The ferry left Dunlaoghairem, Ireland, this morning for the
journey across the Irish Sea. The coast guard said the fire started
in the port side of the engine room. The ship's master declared an
emergency and contacted the coast guard at Holyhead, which sent a
boat and alerted other ships in the area.

   As thousands enjoyed their first Big Macs from
Moscow's new McDonald's, dozens of others stood at tiny tables in a
dim, dingy cafeteria a few blocks away Wednesday and ate the
standard fare of meat and potatoes.
   But for all its problems, the popular Zelyeny Ogonyok, a snack
bar on Pushkin Street, does have a few things McDonald's doesn't:
low prices, experienced workers and a solid reputation.
   ``This is a good place. I come here whenever I can,'' said
Alexei, a middle-aged construction workers, who sipped cabbage soup.
   He admitted he'd rather be at McDonald's, which opened for
business Wednesday on Pushkin Square.
   Zelyeny Ogonyok, Russian for ``green light'' in keeping with its
predominant clientele of taxi drivers, is reputed to be one of
Moscow's best snack shops with good food and service. It even has
its own golden arches of sorts: cylindrical signs outside painted
gold and green.
   But the decor and ambiance leave something to be desired.
There's no place to hang a coat or hat, so diners must wear them.
There's no place to sit, so they must stand. The small chandeliers
are so weak customers can barely see what they're eating _ which
may be a good thing.
   A popular main dish Wednesday was a large meatball, served cold
with beads of fat inside. The price: just 28 kopecks, or about 10
minutes' pay for an average worker, compared to 3.75 rubles for a
Big Mac _ more than two hours' pay. The most expensive item on the
menu was a meat stew, priced at 43 kopecks, or 15 minutes' work.
The cheapest was a piece of Russian black bread for 1 kopeck.
   Elderly women in white smocks and caps scurried around clearing
tables and serving food behind a counter.
   There were few smiles or greetings that are musts for McDonald's
employees, but customers with good eyesight could make out
``spasibo'' Russian or thank you, on each cash register receipt.
   Alexei and several workers of Zelyeny Ogonyok said they had
heard reports about the new McDonald's, which has gotten a big dose
of free publicity on state-run TV and in such publications as
Pravda, Izvestia and Moscow News.
   ``We're waiting for them to invite our entire work collective,
120 people,'' joked Alexandra S. Bobrova, the director of Zelyeny
Ogonyok.

   A couple arrested on charges of robbing three
girls in a schoolyard are also suspected in as many as nine other
schoolgirl muggings, some at gunpoint, since December, police said
today.
   Victor Gonzalez, 23, and his girlfriend, Denise Aponte, 24, were
charged with robbing three girls, ages 6, 8 and 11, of their
earrings and rings on Tuesday, said police spokesman Sgt. Nick
Vreeland.
   The couple told police they were drug users and had sold the
stolen property for narcotics, Vreeland said.
   Gonzalez and Aponte are also suspected of robbing as many as
nine other girls, ages 6 to 14, since Dec. 3, Vreeland said.
   The Police Department originally said Gonzalez was suspected in
as many as 89 other schoolgirl muggings, but Sgt. Peter Sweeney
later said a police spokesman had misunderstood ``eight or nine''
robberies as ``89'' in a phone conversation.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.
   Jan. 30
   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on Bush's budget:
   President Bush's budget is sure to get reworked by Congress and
one area that can be targeted is reducing the nation's military
expenditures overseas. ...
   For example, CIA Director William Webster has told Congress the
intelligence agency concludes that the Soviet threat to the United
States and its NATO allies has diminished due to the democratizing
changes in Eastern Europe.
   That echoed remarks by Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff. After an unprecedented meeting in Vienna of
Western and Warsaw Pact top military brass, he said: ``There is
nothing sacrosanct about the number of American troops stationed in
Europe.'' ...
   Czechoslovakia and Hungary already have said they want Soviet
troops off their soil this year. East Germany has proposed that all
foreign troops leave both Germanys by 1999. And Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev has already said it is his goal to pull all
Soviet troops off foreign soil.
   Savings from further trimming the overseas military budget could
be used in reducing the federal deficit. We now have a chance to
start turning some spears into plowshares to make America even
stronger.
</TEXT>

   Jan. 30
   Los Angeles Times on Bush's budget:
   If nothing else, President Bush's budget should stifle the
notion that talk is cheap. It mentions by name one serious problem
after another, yet makes clear that most of them will be around
long after Washington spends the allotted $1.23 trillion. ...
   The White House has doctored forecasts of economic growth and
interest rates to make it seem as if the deficit will shrink from
$100 billion to a mere $64 billion. Economists generally think that
the national debt could well grow by as much as Bush promises it
will shrink, leaving the world's most prosperous nation still
living way beyond its means. ...
   The president again puts politics and a campaign promise ahead
of smart policy and rules out even minimal increases in taxes that
could get government out of the red. Congress may fuss at Bush for
capricious bookkeeping, but it knows as well as he that voters are
less likely to punish politicians for higher deficits than for
higher taxes. ...
   Even in the absence of new taxes, Congress and the White House
will find ways to keep busy. Bush's proposal to shut down 35
military bases, each of them in the home district of some member of
Congress, is bound to provide weeks or even months of argument over
whether closing some other base would yield greater savings.
Congress probably will cut the $4.5 billion the White House wants
for ``Star Wars'' research, fight to spare domestic programs Bush
would fold and quarrel over the proper level of environmental
protection.
   But these are the ragged edges of government's obligations
compared with the challenges of the national debt, the future of
Social Security, rising health-care costs, education, cleaning up
nuclear waste and other gathering storms.

   Jan. 26
   The Pioneer, Bemidji, Minn., on Social Security:
   The debate over the use of excess Social Security funds is an
interesting dilemma for policy makers and one that the Bush
administration is going to lose in the national public opinion
polls.
   Most people weren't aware until recently that the Social
Security account has been showing a positive balance ever since the
program was re-engineered by Congress.
   The fund balance has been invested in U.S. Treasury notes,
Savings Bonds and other types of government investment programs
and, as a result, the federal deficit has been reduced by almost $1
billion a week over the past year. That's a $50 billion reduction
in the trade deficit.
   Opponents are saying that the funds should stay in the Social
Security Trust Fund. What these individuals fail to understand is
that these funds are ultimately better being invested rather than
laying dormant.
   However, we also feel that, if investments are to be made, there
are far better choices than government securities. Private programs
are administered for much higher returns.

   Two House subcommittees today endorsed
legislation supporting a plan by the major powers aimed at ending
the fighting in Cambodia with United Nations peacekeepers and
administrators.
   ``This represents the last, best chance for peaceful settlement
of the Cambodian conflict,'' said Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-NY,
sponsor of a resolution supporting the plan.
   Solarz' House subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs and the
subcommittee on human rights approved the resolution with unanimous
voice votes and sent it to the full Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Failure to implement the formula by the five permanent Security
Council members to strengthen the U.N. presence in Cambodia ``could
produce results almost too awful to contemplate ... return of the
Khmer Rouge,'' blamed for more than a million Cambodian deaths
during their 1975-78 rule over the Southeast Asian country, Solarz
said.
   ``Anything less than a strong international presence could pave
the way for a return to power of the genocidal Pol Pot,'' leader of
the Khmer Rouge, said human rights subcommittee Chairman Gus
Yatron, D-Pa.
   Yatron also urged that the administration and Congress prepare
to contribute to new U.N. peacekeeping costs. President Bush's 1991
budget presented to Congress this week provides for full payment of
unpaid dues to the U.N.
   The resolution backs the Cambodian peace formula developed by
the five permanent U.N. Security Council members in Paris in
mid-January along lines earlier proposed by Australia. It says
China, the Soviet Union and Vietnam can improve relations with the
United States by cooperating in support of the plan.
   The five permanent Security Council members are the United
States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.
   The draft declared that Soviet support ``for the concept of a
U.N.-supervised interim administration for Cambodia and its active
cooperation in facilitating an agreement will constitute new
progress in U.S.-Soviet efforts to resolve regional conflicts by
political means.''
   It added that Chinese support and cooperation ``will help to
make possible a significant improvement in U.S.-China relations,''
which soured, especially at the Congressional level, after
Beijing's crackdown last summer against the pro-democracy movement.
   With the same promise of improved relations, the resolution
invited cooperation from Vietnam, which last September declared an
end to its 11-year occupation of Cambodia and has been seeking
normal diplomatic relations and trade with the United States.
   The Soviet Union has backed Vietnam and the Vietnamese-installed
Cambodian government in Phonm Penh that is not recognized by the
United States, Western Countries or ASEAN, the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
   China long backed the communist Khmer Rouge, blamed for more
than 1 million Cambodian deaths during their 1975-78 rule over
Cambodia and now threatening a comeback in a revived, escalating
civil war within Cambodia.

   Central Maine Morning Sentinel, Waterville, Maine, on drug abuse:
   The probable political demise of Washington Mayor Marion S.
Barry Jr. carries with it more than a lesson about the consequences
a public official faces when he or she does not live by the law.
   Barry's arrest on cocaine charges, and his subsequent public
confession, also demonstrates the hold drugs can have over an
otherwise intelligent and rational person.
   Drug addiction is nothing new, of course. Indeed, by many
reports, Barry's more serious problem is alcoholism, a disease that
has brought about the downfall of countless people over the decades
and even centuries. But in U.S. society today, no drug carries a
heavier social stigma than crack cocaine. And few cities are more
quickly linked to crack than Barry's own Washington.
   For that half-hour high, Barry risked a long and illustrious
career. He knew that drug use was suspected by police, political
foes and the press. Yet Barry chose to risk the personal tragedy we
have all witnessed for the brief euphoria that crack brings.
   That is the drug's power. It is no wonder that so many people
who have less to risk, who see little hope for prosperity or
success or fame, turn to cocaine for relief.

   The Milwaukee Journal on a homeless shelter across from
Watergate:
   Egads! That word encapsulates the reaction of many condo owners
at the posh Watergate in Washington, D.C., to a planned homeless
shelter across the street.
   The area is already riddled with ``opportunists'' who sit on
grates and ask passing motorists for money, griped one homeowner.
``These are the people we'd like to get rid of.''
   The owners have filed suit, claiming the shelter will lower
their hefty property values. The apartments range in price from
$179,000 to nearly $2.7 million.
   Actually, such juxtaposition of luxury and hardship has much to
recommend it.
   It better enables the well-heeled to face up to the fact of
poverty, which often results from public policy they may have
supported or even helped shape. As they peer into the spartan
quarters from their ritzy pads, perhaps they will learn that
driving away poverty pays more than driving away the poor.

   Burlington County Times, Willingboro, N.J., on semiautomatic
rifles ban:
   Gun makers are shooting holes in the Bush administration's ban
on imports of semiautomatic assault rifles.
   Not only does the administration allow such rifles made by U.S.
manufacturers to continue to be sold, but foreign companies are
increasing exports of military-style assault pistols to the United
States.
   At least five types of semiautomatic assault pistols are being
imported.
   In a petition to the government to extend the ban to assault
pistols, Handgun Control Inc, said: ``In fact, because
semiautomatic pistols have similar firepower but are more
concealable than their assault rifle conterparts, they present an
even greater danger to public safety.''
   That's a loophole that ought to be closed.

   The Keene (N.H.) Sentinel on Japanese computer business:
   American industry is enthralled by the short term.
   Within hours of the demise of U.S. Memories (a computer chip
consortium that decided to buy cheaper Japanese chips after
American firms would not finance it), every one of Japan's largest
makers of memory chips announced plans to cut back on production.
...
   They didn't want to be accused of ... selling goods at below
cost to keep a market share.
   So, while U.S. manufacturers were unable to get together to take
even the most elementary steps to stay in the memory chip business,
Japanese companies were marching in lock step, in their own
interest.

   The Providence (R.I.) Sunday Journal on Eastern Europe:
   Western politicians and journalists sometimes talk as if the
revolutions in Eastern Europe had been won. To put it politely,
their celebrations are premature.
   There are at least three preconditions for the success of
democracy in the Soviet Union's erstwhile satellites: Free
elections, the ouster of communists from control of the security
apparatus and the departure of Soviet troops. None of these
developments has occurred.
   There is a good chance that something like free elections will
be held, but the other two factors make the durability of any
post-election democratic governments problematical.

   Philadelphia Daily News on Bush and China:
   President Bush calls the craven Senate decision to let his
craven China position stand a mandate.
   It is no such thing. It is merely proof that Republicans can be
just as cowardly as Democrats when a vote on principle comes up.
   As Republican Minority Leader Robert Dole put it: ``It's not
China policy. It's American politics.''
   Bush happily accepts the underserved mantle of hero for invading
a third-rate satellite, but continues to grovel at the feet of
elderly Chinese murderers.
   In a non-political context, this would correctly be called
cowardice.

   Democrat-Herald, Baker City, Ore., on spelling errors:
   General Motors Corp. and the San Jose Public Library recently
were embarrassed in separate situations because of the problem that
afflicts all of us from time to time: The inability to spell
correctly. Unfortunately for those two organizations, the media
found out about the errors and published stories.
   In one linguistic gaffe, the world's largest automaker named its
latest show pickup the Mahalo. GM told those attending the North
American International Auto Show the wor meant ``hang loose.''
   Wrong, said Nohea Lani Wallace, an instructor at the Center for
Hawaiian Studies at the University of Hawaii. He said the word
``mahalo'' frequently appears on trash cans in Hawaii. It means
``thank you'' to encourage people not to litter. ...
   That wasn't nearly as funny as the mistake made on a banner
outside the San Jose Public Library in California. The banner,
which cost $10,000 and took three months to finish, was supposed to
say ``welcome'' in 27 languages. It did, in 24, but ``welcome'' was
misspelled in Swedish, Dutch and Tagalog, the chief native language
of the Philippines.
   Apparently the errors in the European languages weren't
particularly embarrassing, but in Tagalog, the banner said
``circumcision.''

   A clergyman said Wednesday that his church
offered lodging for Erich Honecker because the ousted East German
leader was homeless, the ADN news agency reported.
   Justice authorities freed Honecker from prison on health grounds
Tuesday, and the 77-year-old former leader who faces a treason
trial in March was taken to the home of Lutheran pastor Uwe Holmer
in Lobetal, near Bernau.
   Some parishioners were angered by Holmer's action and threatened
to leave the congregation, church official Hans-Otto Furien told
ADN.
   Furien said the church decided to give Honecker and his wife,
Margot, refuge because they were ``in effect, homeless.''
   The church ministers to the weak and down-and-out, and
``Honecker, who a short time ago appeared powerful, is now among
them,'' ADN quoted Furien as saying.
   Honecker is one of about two dozen senior officials of the
disgraced former leadership awaiting trial on charges of corruption
and misuse of office.
   The man who ruled East Germany for 18 years before his ouster
during a pro-democracy uprising in October was jailed Monday,
immediately after he left East Berlin's Charite hospital, where was
recuperating from cancer surgery.
   But an East Berlin court refused to issue a detention warrant,
noting Honecker's ill health, and he was freed Tuesday night.
   Christian Naecke, a church official in Dresden, said he had
received many insulting calls because Honecker had been given
refuge by a fellow pastor.

<HEAD>Bush's Soaring Rhetoric Left Along With Speechwriter Noonan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's State of the Union
speechwriters had a hard act to follow: matching nuggets once
provided by wordsmith Peggy Noonan, who coined ``a thousand points
of light'' and ``read my lips'' but who now suggests her job was
neither kind nor gentle.
   Noonan has been out of favor at the White House since she left
last year to write a book about her days as a speechwriter for both
Bush and former President Reagan.
   She says aides to both men continually pounced on her words and
sought to do major overhauls on her speeches, that Bush balked at
reading any lines that contained the word ``I,'' and that Reagan,
the ``Great Communicator,'' was at a loss for words when she asked
what moved him in his eight years as president.
   White House officials say Noonan, who lives in New York, has not
been asked to work on a Bush speech since last year's inaugural
address because of a new policy to do all speeches ``in house.''
   Aides privately say that Noonan was getting a trifle too famous
for a speechwriter who is supposed to be, well, mostly anonymous.
But they also concede Bush hasn't sounded quite so striking since
she stopped putting words in his mouth.
   ``The underpinnings of the United States, the state of the
union, is not bad,'' Bush told a group of newspaper publishers last
week when asked to preview his Wednesday night address.
   ``Not bad,'' might be an honest assessment. But it doesn't have
much ring.
   In Bush's 1989 inaugural address, he spoke of a ``new breeze''
blowing through the totalitarian world. He promised Democratic
leaders an ``age of the offered hand.'' And he summed up the
nation's budget woes in six words: ``We have more will than
wallet.''
   Vintage Noonan _ and the last speech she wrote for him.
   Noonan recounts her experiences as a speechwriter for Bush and
Reagan in her book, ``What I Saw at the Revolution: A Political
Life in the Reagan Era,'' published last week.
   Bush has made no secret of his disdain for insider books written
by former aides, and the publication of Noonan's book hardly helped
to heal any rift between her and the White House.
   When she began writing speeches for Bush in the 1988 campaign,
Noonan writes, he gave her a list of words with special meaning to
him: ``family, grandkids, love, decency, honor, pride, tolerance,
hope, kindness, loyalty, freedom, caring, heart, faith, service to
country, fair (fair play), strength, healing, excellence.''
   From those threads she began weaving Bush's speeches. But she
ran up against one major obstacle: ``George Bush hated to say `I.'''
   ``I became adept at pronounless sentences,'' Noonan says.
``Instead of `I moved to Texas and soon we joined the Republican
Party,' it was `Moved to Texas, joined the Republican Party, raised
a family.'''
   Noonan suggests Bush's modesty came from his ``doughty old
mom,'' Dorothy Walker Bush, ``who used to rap his knuckles for
bragging, a brag apparently being defined as any sentence with the
first person singular as its subject.''
   She confesses visions of Bush taking the oath on the Capitol
steps with these words: ``Do solemnly swear, will preserve and
protect. ...'''
   Bush's characterization of a ``kinder, gentler nation,''
contained in his acceptance speech to the Republican National
Convention, has become one of the president's signature phrases.
But, Noonan writes, it was just ``kinder nation'' in her first
draft. She later scribbled in ``gentler.''
   Bush's ``no new taxes'' line, also in the same widely acclaimed
acceptance speech, was suggested by Jack Kemp, now the secretary of
Housing and Urban Development, Noonan says.
   But she takes all the credit for ``read my lips,'' even though
Bush aides tried to take it out because ``there is no history of
presidential candidates making personal-organ references in
acceptance speeches.''
   Bush left it in. One line he scratched out: a reference to
Michael Dukakis' physical stature.
   Noonan claims credit for Bush's ``thousand points of light,''
but allows it might have been influenced by a line from a favorite
author, Thomas Wolfe, who wrote in ``The Web and the Rock'' of a
``thousand points of friendly light.''
   Noonan, who also wrote Reagan's farewell television speech to
the nation, says she had trouble drawing out the ``Great
Communicator'' in five drafting sessions she had with him in the
last two months of his term.
   When she asked him what his most difficult day was, Reagan
responded: ``Oh well, I don't know.''
   She then asked Reagan if he sometimes felt like the ``boy in the
bubble?''
   ``Who was that?'' Noonan says he asked.
   ``The boy who had no immune system, so he had to live in a
plastic bubble where he could see everyone and they could see him
but ... he couldn't touch them,'' she tells him.
   Reagan's reply: ``Well, no.''
   Bush's White House now has five speechwriters _ Mark Davis, Mark
Lange, Daniel McGroaty, Edward E. McNally and Curt Smith _ who make
a point of maintaining low profiles, refuse to be interviewed and
aren't even well known to other White House staffers.
   McGroaty, 32, who was a speechwriter for defense secretaries
Caspar W. Weinberger and Frank C. Carlucci, did the initial draft
of Wednesday's State of the Union address.
   It was refined by Chief of Staff John Sununu and White House
communications director David Demarest. New York media consultant
Roger Ailes, who worked for Bush's 1988 campaign, worked with Bush
Tuesday and Wednesday on preparation.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II's tour of
impoverished Sahel nations this week bypassed this city, which is
home to the newly built and largest Roman Catholic basilica in the
world.
   Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny donated the basilica to
the Roman Catholic church, and met with John Paul last year to urge
him to consecrate it during his current African trip.
   The government-controlled news media has waged a campaign to win
support from Roman Catholics, who comprise 15 percent of the West
African nation's population, for the basilica. The president has
been shown attending Roman Catholic events and praising the pope.
   But the basilica has been criticized as a waste of resources in
a country suffering from shortages of basic medicines, crowded
classrooms and an economy reeling from depressed prices for its
agricultural exports.
   Houphouet-Boigny defends construction of the basilica, which
officially cost about $130 million, saying he built it with his own
funds. Independent assessments put the cost at possibly twice that
amount, and the use of government departments in construction makes
an accurate estimate difficult.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro defended the pope's decision
not to consecrate the Ivorian basilica.
   ``The pope cannot consecrate every basilica in the world. Every
year he gets thousands of invitations and he cannot satisfy
everyone,'' Navarro said last month.
   The basilica, with air-conditioned pews, has seven acres of
Italian marble tiles and four times more stained glass than the
French cathedral at Chartres. It is designed to hold 300,000, and
dwarfs other structures in the president's native village, which he
has declared the national capital.
   A papal visit would have been a sharp constrast to the
desperately poor villages he visited an hour's jet ride to the
north in Burkina Faso and Mali.
   Meanwhile, the basilica, completed in September, awaits
consecration.
   The government-published daily Fraternite Matin reported last
week that the Roman Catholic episcopate will report on the basilica
to the pope later this year. The newspaper said the pope will
include Ivory Coast on a trip to Africa planned for later this
year, but it did not say if he would consecrate the basilica.
   The episcopate has agreed to accept the basilica, but diplomatic
sources said that in addition to the question of propriety, the
church was concerned about the millions of dollars it would cost
annually for maintenance. Even if Houphouet-Boigny, 84, is prepared
to pay these costs, the question was whether future governments
would honor such a commitment.

   A judge today ordered the eviction of a
72-year-old woman who has been living for nearly 20 years in a
ramshackle homestead on the proposed site of a state park.
   Doris Gagnon was granted an automatic 20-day stay, and Superior
Court Judge Judge Karen Sequino said it is likely the woman will be
found eligible for a stay of up to nine months.
   ``I am sorry our system is this way and our average citizen
cannot get justice,'' Gagnon said after her defeat.
   During a hearing Tuesday, Gagnon said she preferred to live with
dozens of animals at her makeshift home on state property than move
to senior citizen housing. ``I'm not a bingo player. I can't sit
around all day,'' she said.
   State attorneys had said Gagnon and her neighbors in the city of
Milford would be better off if she were evicted from the site where
she has lived without electricity, running water, a phone and
adequate sanitation.
   Gagnon has been fighting the state ever since the mid-1960s,
when efforts began to establish a park on the 200-acre site along
Long Island Sound. Her cottage was demolished in 1971, but she
refused to leave the area, living out of her car for a year before
erecting a tin shed.
   For the past decade, she has lived in dilapidated trailers and
makeshift structures along with a menagerie that now includes three
cats, three dogs, two geese, 12 ducks and about 50 chickens.
   The state moved to evict Gagnon last year as a result of a
complaint filed by the Milford health department, which said it
found bags of human sewage piled up behind her living quarters.
   Gagnon's attorney, Karen Torre, said she planned to ask the
judge to give her client, who has been battling cancer, at least
three more years on the land.
   Although a $5 million project to seal a landfill in the northern
section of the proposed park and create an access road is scheduled
to get under way next month, further development of the park so
that it can be used for recreational purposes is still two to three
years away, state officials have said.
   Gagnon, who sported an ``Enjoy Your Age'' button on her
short-sleeve white-and-blue sweater, told the court Tuesday she
could not leave her animals.
   ``When the city was doing things to me, they were my only
consolation outside of my friends,'' she said.
   She denied having regularly dumped bags of sewage outside her
trailers. But Gagnon also testified that she had never had the
sewage tanks in her trailers cleaned out, and a witness recalled
her saying she dumped all the waste in a garbage bin.

   A car bomb exploded in the central
business district in Afghanistan's capital of Kabul on Wednesday,
killing six people and injuring another 122, Afghanistan's official
radio reported.
   ``The material used in the explosion was provided by Pakistan
and the United States,'' said the Radio Kabul broadcast monitored
in Islamabad.
   The broadcast blamed the U.S.-backed guerrillas for the bomb,
although no group claimed responsibility.
   Most of the anti-Communist guerrillas who have been fighting for
more than 11 years to topple successive communist governments are
based in Pakistan.
   The United States sends guerrilla fighters an estimated $500
million worth of military supplies annually through Pakistan.
   Moscow sends about $300 million to its allies in Kabul. The
Kremlin ended nine years of direct military intervention in
Afghanistan in February 1989.
   Radio Kabul estimated property damage in Wednesday's blast at
$2,000.
   Scores of people have been killed and hundreds more injured in
rocket attacks on Kabul in the past several months. Radio Kabul has
blamed the Moslem insurgents.
   Guerrilla fighters claim their rockets and bombs are directed at
military installations, not civilian targets. They admit that stray
rockets sometimes land in residential areas, but often charge the
Kabul government with rocketing its own people to turn the
population against the guerrillas.
   Claims made by either side often are impossible to verify.

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Andres Perez was
elected by a landslide, but has angered nearly everyone during his
first year with economic reforms that provoked bloody riots and
drove up the cost of living.
   Many foreign dignitaries attended his lavish inauguration Feb.
2, 1989, including President Fidel Castro of Cuba, Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez of Spain and Vice President Dan Quayle of the
United States.
   His victory reflected the popularity gained in his first term as
president, in 1974-79. The approval evaporated when Perez imposed
the austerity demanded by foreign lenders in return for help with
Venezuela's debt of $33 billion.
   A week of riots against price increases for food and public
transport cost 300 lives. Thousands of people were injured and
thousands of businesses set afire.
   Perez now faces severe criticism from just about every sector of
Venezuelan politics, including leaders of his own social democratic
party, Democratic Action.
   ``His heart's not in it,'' an American businessman said
privately. ``I've been amazed to see him carry out these reforms
against all the odds.''
   A new round of criticism began when Perez said new increases
were planned in the price of gasoline produced by state-owned oil
conglomerate Petroleos de Venezuela.
   Venezuela is a major oil producers and its gasoline prices have
been among the lowest in the world. Even after last year's
increases, a gallon of regular costs the equivalent of only 13
cents.
   When reporters asked Perez recently whether he would go ahead
with new increases despite protests, he responded:
   ``My God, if were up to me I would dissolve our agreements with
the International Monetary Fund. But we live in the Western world,
and in order to live in the Western world and get agreements with
Western banks, we have to do certain things.''
   The IMF, World Bank and other lenders, agreed to provide $8
billion to $10 billion over five years to support the economic
reform program and help Venezuela pay its foreign debt.
   Reforms include ending gasoline and other subsidied; tariff
reforms aimed at increasing both imports and exports; making state
enterprises more efficient, and other free-market measures.
   A recent poll conducted by the newspaper El Universal indicated
55 percent of Venezuelans favored a return to the old system of
subsidized prices and economic regulation, while only 28 percent
approved of the reforms.
   Of those polled, 32 percent said Perez was doing an average job,
21.7 percent said his performance was poor and 18 percent found his
conduct of the presidency to be good. Fifteen percent rated him
``very bad'' 6.5 percent ``very good.'' rating.
   The U.S. businessman said: ``Perez is doing very well. The steps
he's taken so far show he's willing to hold out against the
opposition, even in his own party, to his economic program.''
   Nearly everyone has been effected by changes that have shrunk
the economy by 8.1 percent and pushed inflation to a record 80.7
percent in 1989.
   Poverty and unemployment have increased. Labor leaders claim the
unempoloyment rate is 20 percent, more than double the official
figure.
   ``My balance of the year is totally negative,'' said Cesar
Olarte, head of the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers. ``Perez
promised growth without inflation, and look what we've got:
inflation and recession.''
   His organization, long an ally of governments that have employed
one-quarter of the nation's 6 million workers, recently decided to
step up protests of the economic program.
   Olarte said the austerity plan ``has only brought misery and
suffering. It has to be stopped, or at least implemented more
gradually. Perez is being insensitive. He should know, as a
politician, to listen to the people instead of his advisers.
Democracy could be in danger.''
   In contrast, Tomas Paez, planning director of the Development
Ministry, said: ``Critical poverty and unemployment are nothing new
in Venezuela. They are not the product of the reforms, but the
other way around.
   ``The reforms are trying to change an industrial system that was
inefficient, could not compete, depended on government protection
and only generated 5,000 jobs a year.''
   Economists say it will take two to five years for the reform
program to start benefiting the average Venezuelan.

<TEXT>
   A panel of experts is recommending that the
anti-AIDS drug AZT be prescribed more widely for people in early
stages of infection by the virus that causes AIDS.
   Research has ``clearly established'' that AZT, or zidovudine,
delays the onset of AIDS in people infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, the Food and Drug Administration
advisory committee said Tuesday.
   But the committee also emphasized ``the need to carefully study
and document the potential risks associated with prolonged
zidovudine therapy, especially those related to the drug's
cancer-causing potential, and any possible unique effects on
women's fetuses and children.''
   AZT is approved for use in patients who have full-blown AIDS,
but a government-sponsored study has shown the drug can prolong the
lives of people in earlier stages of the disease.
   Some physicians already prescribe the drug for people with early
or no symptoms of AIDS.
   Last August, officials at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases announced that clinical trials showed AZT
significantly slows progression of AIDS in patients with early
symptoms and no symptoms. The results were so promising that of
officials stopped the clinical trial and began offering AZT to all
patients in the study, including those who had been receiving
placebos for comparison.
   The Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee unanimously agreed the
FDA should recommend use of AZT in people with levels of critical
immune system cells, called T-4 cells, under 500 per cubic
millimeter.
   The drug is now recommended for use in people whose T-4 cells
are below 200. Disease in such patients is considered to be in an
advanced stage and many such patients have full-blown AIDS.
   AZT, made by Burroughs Wellcome Co., is the only FDA-approved
drug that combats the AIDS virus directly. It is being used by more
than 40,000 people in the United States.
   As many as 500,000 of the estimated 800,000 to 1.3 million
people in the United States infected with HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, are believed to have T-4 cell counts between 200 and
500, according to the Public Health Service. However, many of these
people do not know they are infected with HIV.
   Two weeks ago, the FDA cut in half the recommended dose of AZT
for AIDS patients who are on the medication for more than a month.
   The agency cited studies showing the half-dose regimen was less
likely to produce side effects but just as effective as the higher
dose in prolonging survival and reducing the frequency of
infections that often kill.

<TEXT>
   A relief agency said it plans to increase
food deliveries Thursday to the beleaguered southern Sudan town of
Juba, where civilians are reported starving while war rages around
them.
   The Lutheran World Federation's office in Nairobi said it would
add a chartered Hercules C-130 to the Boeing 707 it already leases
from Sudan Airways for the relief flights.
   ``What it means is that we will be able to deliver food there
daily, without interruption,'' said Bob Koepp, who is in charge of
the Lutheran group's activities in southern Sudan.
   Koepp said Wednesday the addition of the Hercules will bring to
64 tons the amount of food being delivered daily to Juba by the
group.
   Koepp said the Hercules would hasten the delivery of 2,000 tons
of corn donated by the Italian government that has been sitting at
Nairobi's airport.
   The Sudanese government banned relief flights into southern
Sudan on Nov. 3 after a cease-fire with the rebels broke down, and
Juba's only source of food since then has been the flights from the
Lutheran World Federation.
   Koepp appealed to rebel and government forces to ``please
respect and allow the aircraft and its crews free and safe
passage.''
   But the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, which has
sporadically bombarded Juba with artillery fire, was noncommittal.
   ``This is the first time I have heard of the additional
aircraft,'' said Lam Akol, a rebel spokesman. ``In any case, they
go in at their own risk.''
   Only the Lutherans have delivered non-Sudanese government food
supplies to Juba since Sudan's government banned relief flights
Nov. 3 after an informal cease-fire with the rebels broke down.
   Relief workers evacuated from Juba this week described a city of
panic. They said thousands of people are starving but cannot leave
the city of 300,000 because it is ringed with mines laid by
government troops and the rebels.
   The mines ``have weekly claimed the lives of people searching
for firewood and-or food,'' says an American Catholic priest in a
letter to colleagues in Nairobi and Washington D.C.
   The clergyman, the Rev. Todd Riebe of Indianapolis, is a high
school principal in Juba and has opted to stay. He appealed for
international pressure to halt ``the impending massacre'' of Juba's
people.
   ``We are facing a human tragedy of immense proportions,'' Riebe
wrote in the letter, which was made available to The Associated
Press.
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army launched its rebellion in
early 1983, demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms in the
three southern provinces of Bahr el-Ghazal, Upper Nile and
Equatoria.

   A coalition of church, labor and policy groups
launched a nationwide education effort Wednesday to ensure that
more than 11 million low-income families receive a tax rebate for
which they are eligible.
   ``It's a crime to think that this money is available and so many
people are not taking advantage of it and they have earned it,''
said James Moran, mayor of Alexandria, Va.
   Most low-income people know about Medicaid, public assistance,
food stamps, school lunch and other government programs for the
poor, but significantly fewer have heard of the earned income
credit, said Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities, an independent research group.
   ``This is not a public assistance program. It's not a welfare
program,'' Greenstein said. ``It is an earned benefit that only
families which work are eligible for and only families who live
with and care for their children may receive.''
   The earned income tax credit was created by Congress in 1974 to
offset the impact of Social Security payroll taxes on the working
poor. Families with at least one child living at home for half the
year and earned or adjusted gross income of less than $19,340 in
1989 are eligible.
   Organizers didn't estimate how many families are eligible for
the credit, but said 11 million taxpayers received $6 billion in
credits last year.
   The groups planned to distribute 11,000 information packets
through churches, civic groups and state and local government
offices. The AFL-CIO also has produced a public service
announcement in Spanish.
   The credit varies with individual households. With annual income
of between $6,500 and $10,240, a parent taxpayer is eligible for a
$910 credit. Families with income less than $6,500 are eligible for
a credit equal to 14 percent of that incoe.
   The credit decreases once income exceeds $10,240 and phases out
at $19,340 earned or adjusted gross income.
   Rural and Hispanic families, who make up a disproportionate
number of low-income wage earners and don't owe income tax, will be
a special target for the campaign.
   ``The concern is that these families, owing no federal income
tax ... may believe that there's no need to file an income tax
return,'' Greenstein said.
   ``They may think that if they don't owe any income tax they
can't get credit, but the IRS will mail them a check for the full
amount of the credit for which they are eligible.''
   If they don't file the return, they lose the credit, Greenstein
said.
   Eligible workers can receive the credit in their regular
paychecks throughout the year by filing a W-5 form with their
employers.
   Other groups in the coalition include the National Council of La
Raza, U.S. Catholic Conference, the National Governors'
Association, the United Way and the National Restaurant Association.
   Coalition members said they chose Wednesday to begin their
campaign because it marked the unofficial start of the 1989 income
tax season and the last day for employers to mail W-2 income
withholding statements to workers.

   West German leaders on Wednesday praised
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's apparent acceptance of
reunification as a signal that may instill hope in East Germans
fearful of the uncertainties of reform.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl called the Kremlin chief's latest
comments on German unity ``encouraging,'' and Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Gorbachev had ``correctly analyzed''
the volatile situation in East Germany.
   East Germany's official news agency ADN said that by making
clear his change of mind on the German question, Gorbachev ``once
more confirmed for all the world his reputation as a politician of
realism.''
   Support for union with prosperous West Germany has surged among
East Germans in recent weeks as the depths of their political and
economic crises have become clear.
   East German Premier Hans Modrow acknowledged in a speech to
Parliament this week that the nation was on the verge of economic
collapse, and said mounting tensions forced him to move up free
elections to March 18.
   As many as 2,500 East Germans have been leaving each day,
convinced that they stand a better chance starting over in the West
than trying to rebuild their nation driven to the brink of
destruction by 40 years of Communist mismanagement.
   Anti-Communist sentiment has swelled among the population of 16
million, sparking mass demonstrations and labor strikes to protest
the distrusted party's continued hold on the reins of power.
   A Lutheran pastor gave refuge to former leader Erich Honecker
after he was released from prison Tuesday, and church officials
reported Wednesday that their humanitarian action prompted
insulting phone calls and threats by parishioners to leave the
church.
   Honecker, who ruled for 18 years before being forced out of
office in October by the peaceful pro-democracy uprising, faces
trial in March on a treason charge.
   Modrow, a reformer who is more trusted than most of his fellow
Communists, was forced by the growing hostility toward his
still-dominant party to bring nine opposition representatives into
his Cabinet.
   The pro-democracy forces joining Modrow were to submit their
proposed ministers by Wednesday, and three of the parties publicly
announced the names of the representatives they put forward.
   The Social Democrats, who were hesitant to enter into a
coalition with the political parties blamed for East Germany's
current crises, nominated Walter Romberg, who has not played a
prominent role in the party to date. The Initiative for Peace and
Human Rights proposed Gerd Poppe and Democracy Now offered Wolfgang
Ullmann. Poppe and Ullmann are negotiators for their respective
groups at the weekly talks that advise Modrow's interim government.
   In Bonn, Kohl devoted much of his address at a Cabinet meeting
to the issue of German unity and the exodus of East Germans that is
inflicting social and economic strains on both sides of the border.
   Government spokesman Hans Klein, a member of the West German
Cabinet, said Kohl found Gorbachev's views on reunification
``encouraging.''
   Gorbachev commented during talks with Modrow in Moscow on
Tuesday that a single German state was likely in the future,
although he cautioned that East Germans ``should not decide this
important issue on the streets.''
   Weekly pro-democracy rallies in Leipzig and other major cities
have taken on a clear pro-reunification atmosphere recently.
   West German newspapers reported Gorbachev's comments prominently
and hailed his apparent acceptance of German reunification as
coming to grips with reality.
   ``Gorbachev has once again shown himself to be a politician of
realism who has correctly analyzed the developments in East Germany
and the will of the people,'' Genscher told West German Radio.
   Klein quoted Kohl as telling his Cabinet that Gorbachev's
tentative approval of eventual reunification could give East
Germans hope of better days to come and halt the exodus.
   ``We want all people in East Germany to find their opportunities
in life in their own land,'' Kohl said, according to Klein.
``Resettlement must be left as a last resort. Jobs and homes are in
limited supply in West Germany.''
   The West German Constitution recognizes all ethnic Germans as
citizens and provides them with generous resettlement aid when they
immigrate.
   But the influx of more than 340,000 East Germans last year and
an exit trend that threatens to drive a million more to the West
this year has heightened social tensions in West Germany.
   Kohl suggested Gorbachev had eased the fears of East Germans by
making clear that the Kremlin would not stand in the way of
reunification.

<HEAD>Leading Indicators Up, But Analysts Say Economy Still Weak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge rose in December at its fastest pace in eight months, the
government said Wednesday, but analysts suggested the economy
remains weak athough able to avoid a recession.
   The Commerce Department said the Index of Leading Economic
Indicators rose 0.8 percent last month, helping to inch the
forecasting gauge up 0.4 percent for the year. It was the weakest
increase since the index actually fell 1.5 percent in 1984.
   And since the index rose just 0.4 percent for the year, compared
with an increase of 3.9 percent for all of 1988, it suggests the
economy could be more sluggish this year than in 1989. The index is
designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months in the
future.
   ``The leading indicators were essentially flat for most of
1989,'' noted Kevin Logan, chief economist for the Swiss Bank Corp.
in New York. ``They basically moved sideways and that's the
situation for the economy at the moment.''
   David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association, had a similar assessment, saying the December increase
``really overstates the economy's strength over the near term, the
next 6 to 12 months.''
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, also cautioned against reading too much into one month's
change although he said the administration believes the economy
will be improving through the year.
   Boskin spoke to reporters after an appearance before the House
Budget Committee in which he defended the administration's economic
forecast for 1990, which projects the overall economy will grow by
2.4 percent while interest rates will come down _ a projection
questioned by many private economists.
   In another report, the department said new home sales, pinched
by severe weather, declined 9.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 629,000 units in December. That put sales for the
year at 650,000, down 3.8 percent from 1988 in large part because
of high mortgage interest rates. It was the slowest pace since
1984, when 639,000 new homes were sold.
   Analysts agreed that most of the increase in the December
leading index came from unfilled aircraft orders, partly due to a
strike at the Boeing Co. and partly because such orders often take
months to fill after they are made.
   But many, like Berson, also agreed with Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, who told Congress on Tuesday that the economy is
unlikely to fall into a recession.
   ``We're not going to have a recession,'' Berson said. ``There's
still a risk, but most likely the economy will strengthen a little
bit in the first quarter and more by the middle of the year.''
   Others were more concerned.
   ``I think that we're very, very close'' to a recession, said
Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``I mean, we're as close to being in a recession
without being in one as you can be.''
   In addition to the backlog of manufacturers' unfilled orders,
other contributors to the December increase were an increase in
plant and equipment orders, higher stock prices, a rise in the
money supply, an increase in building permits and a gain in an
index measuring consumer confidence.
   A drop in the price of raw materials was the major negative
factor in the index. While such a decrease is considered good news
for inflation prospects, it is counted as a negative in the index
because it also can reflect declining demand.
   Other negatives were an increase in weekly unemployment claims,
a decline in orders for consumer goods and a speedup in business
delivery times.
   The average work week was unchanged.
   The various changes left the index at 145.7 percent of its 1982
base of 100.
   For the year, the index posted increases in seven months:
January, April, July, August, September, November and December. It
declined in February, March, May, June and October.

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gay Episcopal priest who caused an uproar
with his comments on celibacy and monogamy says he will not honor a
request that he refrain from priestly duties while the diocese
investigates his views.
   Bishop John S. Spong asked the Rev. Robert Williams not to
function as a priest while the Commission on Ministry reviews the
screening process that led to his ordination, Assisting Bishop
Walter Righter of Newark said Tuesday.
   ``It means he doesn't have a job in the church,'' Righter said.
   However, in an interview from Texas on Tuesday with The
Star-Ledger of Newark, Williams, 34, said Spong would have to bring
him to an ecclesiastical trial to strip him of his duties.
   ``If he wants to spend another quarter-million dollars, he can
take me to trial,'' Williams said.
   He said complying with Spong's request would ``keep me from
exercising the ministry I've been called to do.''
   Church officials are investigating whether Williams misled the
commission about his views during the screening process. He told
the newspaper he was never questioned about his views on monogamy
before he was approved for ordination.
   Spong said Williams has resigned at his request from his
position as executive director of The Oasis, a Hoboken ministry for
gay men and women, following comments he made at a Jan. 13 church
forum in Detroit in which he said ``monogamy is as unnatural as
celibacy.''
   Williams, a Texas native, was asked not to conduct Mass this
weekend for a homosexual group in Dallas called The Integrity, The
Dallas Morning News reported.
   Keith Hobbs, secretary of the group, said members did not want
their goal of working within the church to be ``clouded over by
some of these issues.''
   Williams was ordained Dec. 16 by Spong despite objections from
many church conservatives. The homosexual priest has lived with
James Skelly, 39, a hospital administrator, for four years.
   Spong has asked Williams to apologize for his statements on
monogamy and celibacy.
   Williams said he will look at other options, including another
church, if his ministry is permanently suspended.
   ``Bishops don't ordain people,'' Williams told The Dallas
Morning News. ``The Holy Spirit does. My ministry to the gay and
lesbian community will continue whether or not it's in the
Episcopal Church.''

   A Chinese man who hijacked a Chinese airliner to
Japan in December asked Wednesday for political asylum, saying the
act was his last-ditch attempt to flee political persecution.
   Zhang Zhenhai, of China's Hebei province, said in a statement
released through his Japanese lawyers that he would face the death
penalty in China because he had joined in the pro-democracy
demonstrations in Beijing last June.
   Zhang, who faces possible repatriation under international law,
said that before the hijacking, he had failed twice to escape China
by land due to tight security after the bloody suppression of
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   ``Please do not send me back to China,'' his statement asked of
the Japanese government. ``Please give me freedom ... or repatriate
me only after my execution (in Japan).''
   Zhang, 35, hijacked the plane on Dec. 16, threatening to blow it
up with a bomb that he did not actually have. The Boeing 747, on a
flight from Beijing to New York with 233 people aboard, flew to
Fukuoka in western Japan after South Korea refused to let it land
there.
   After landing, Zhang was shoved out of the plane by a crew
member and was hospitalized with a broken pelvis. The plane was
returned to China on Dec. 17 with 208 passengers on board,
including Zhang's wife and 13-year-old son.
   Zhang was transferred from a hospital to a jail in Fukuoka on
Dec. 31, and sent to a detention house in Tokyo Jan. 11.
   The Tokyo High Public Prosecutors Office is studying what action
to take against Zhang. Action is likely in March, when his
condition is expected to improve, said Masahiro Sumita, one of
Zhang's three Japanese lawyers.
   China has demanded Zhang's return, and China's state-run TV has
carried brief reports on the hijacking, adding that Zhang had been
arrested in October on charges of embezzling from a factory.
   Japanese officials, including Chief Cabinet Secretary Mayumi
Moriyama, have maintained that even if Zhang's claim is true,
hijacking is still a serious crime.
   Kazuyo Iwaki, another Japanese lawyer, has said that Zhang
claimed he had been arrested twice in connection with pro-democracy
demonstrations in China.
   On Wednesday, Sumita, Ms. Iwaki and a third lawyer, Yaeko
Takeoka, notified the prosecutors office that they would represent
Zhang until the Tokyo High Court decides whether to sent him back
to China.
   ``Next week we will apply to the court for Zhang's status as a
refugee,'' Sumita said.
   Sumita said he and the other two lawyers have volunteered to
represent Zhang free of charge ``for humanity's sake.'' In a case
like Zhang's, each of the three lawyers normally would charge about
$7,000 in fees if the case were settled in a few months, he added.

<HEAD>Interior Panel OKs Settlement of Damages Due Seminoles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Interior Committee voted Wednesday
to settle a 14-year-old dispute among the Seminole Indians by
giving 73 percent of about $50 million in federal damages to the
Oklahoma tribe and 27 percent to Seminoles in Florida.
   The distribution differs from legislation passed in November by
the Senate that calls for an approximately 75-25 split, but it
represents a compromise in the House, where the Florida delegation
was seeking 30 percent of the money for its branch of the tribe.
   The bill now goes to the full House for a vote and, if approved
in the form passed by the committee, will go to a conference
committee to work out differences with the Senate version.
   Originally, the Florida Seminoles pushed for a 50-50
distribution, leading to a disagreement that the Indians could not
settle among themselves.
   The dispute began in 1976, when the Seminoles were awarded $16
million for Florida lands taken during the 1823 relocation of most
of the tribe to Oklahoma.
   The money, which has been held by the Treasury Department
because of the disagreement over its distribution, grew to $50
million through years of accumulated interest.
   In the absence of agreement among the Seminoles, the government
worked out the 75-25 split based on population figures that counted
2,146 Seminoles in Oklahoma and 700 in Florida.
   The government also found the Oklahoma tribe to be poorer, with
only about 380 acres of tribally owned land, while the Florida
branch, which includes the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida and the
unaffiliated Seminole Indians of Florida, has about 80,000 acres.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors today said they will retry
Raymond Buckey on the 13 conspiracy and child-molestation charges
on which a jury deadlocked during the marathon McMartin Pre-school
trial.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders accepted the decision to
go forward with a new trial and urged that it begin quickly because
``the range of emotions is very high.'' Pounders set a trial date
of March 9.
   Deputy District Attorneys Lael Rubin and Roger Gunson ended the
suspense that had surrounded the case since Jan. 18, when the jury
in the longest and costliest criminal trial in U.S. history
acquitted Buckey and his mother on 52 molestation charges but
deadlocked on 13 counts against Buckey.
   Prosecutors had the option of dismisssing the remaining counts
but after days of meetings with District Attorney Ira Reiner
decided to proceed.
   Buckey, 31, and his 63-year-old mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey,
had been accused of molesting 11 children at their Manhattan Beach
preschool during a five-year period.
   In the two weeks since the acquittals, the preschoolers'
parents, the children and rgwue allies have appeared on national
television, called news conferences, collected letters of support
and enlisted politicians in support of a retrial.
   ``This is a positive step for us,'' said Mary Mae Cioffi, a
McMartin parent who has led the campaign to retry Buckey. ``I'm
going to run home and tell my kids we get another chance.''
   The trial lasted nearly three years and cost taxpayers more than
$13 million. Buckey spent nearly five years in jail before he was
released on $1.5 million bail last February.
   The future of the case was complicated by a motion filed by
Buckey's attorney claiming Pounders is biased against the defendant
and should be removed from the case.
   Defense attorney Danny Davis said Pounders had made comments
throughout the trial indicating his belief that the defendants were
guilty and had expressed prejudice against Davis himself.
   Pounders denied the allegations and said he would file a
response proving he is unbiased and able to preside at the new
trial. The judge said he knew of no other judge who would want to
take over the controversial case.

   A judge who said a church's electronic
bells inflicted ``harm and damages'' on neighbors has ordered them
silenced until a court hearing helps the two sides reach a
compromise.
   A lawyer for Bellshire United Methodist Church said the church
had turned down the carillon to 50 percent of its power and was
preparing to move its speakers higher on the steeple to further
reduce the sound.
   Vaughan Pritchett, one of three neighbors who sued Dec. 18 to
stop the bells, said lowering the power did not help.
   ``Noise alone may be a nuisance to those affected when, because
of its volume, character, proximity or unreasonableness, it causes
material distress, discomfort or injury,'' Chancellor C. Allen High
wrote in his opinion Monday.
   After the lawsuit was filed, the chimes sounded nine times a day
into the early evening. Pritchett said they could not be heard
Wednesday.
   He said residents were not protesting the content of the music,
only its loudness.
   Church attorney George Cate Jr. said Bellshire United would
request another hearing soon.
   The carillon was installed in September with $7,700 donated by a
former church member in memory of her son, said the Rev. Stephen
Smith, pastor at Bellshire.

<HEAD>De Klerk Orders Probe Into Jail Hanging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk
ordered a judicial inquiry Wednesday into the death of a
20-year-old black man found hanged in his prison cell.
   The man was arrested Friday along with four others accused in
the slayings of 10 people in guerrilla attacks over the past two
years. He reportedly was a former lover of jailed black leader
Nelson Mandela's daughter.
   Clayton Sithole was found hanging from a shower pipe Tuesday at
John Vorster Square, Johannesburg's central police station, police
said.
   Shortly after Sithole's death was announced, de Klerk ordered a
judicial inquiry, a step not taken after scores of previous
incidents in which black activists died while in police custody.
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok expressed condolences to
Sithole's family.
   According to local newspapers, Sithole was a former lover of
Zindzi Mandela and fathered one of her three children. There was no
immediate comment from the Mandelas, but associates of the family
said they believed the report was accurate.
   A family friend of the Mandelas, who requested anonymity, said
Sithole belonged to a controversial group of young men who served
as Winnie Mandela's bodyguards. Nine people associated with the
group have been in custody for months awaiting trial for the death
of a young black activist.
   Neither Vlok nor de Klerk indicated whether the decision to
launch an investigation was related to Sithole's reported
connection to the Mandela family. Mandela, 71, is widely expected
to be freed in the next few weeks after more than 27 years in
prison for his role in planning the guerrilla campaign of the
African National Congress. The organization is the main black group
fighting the white-led government.
   Denis Worrall, co-leader of the anti-apartheid Democratic Party,
welcomed de Klerk's swift response.
   ``It is surprising that President de Klerk would do this,''
Worrall said. ``I'm quite sure that a judicial commission of
inquiry would be justified.''
   Audrey Coleman, a prominent human rights activist, said
Sithole's family suspected the young man had been mistreated and
would obtain its own pathologist to conduct an independent post
mortem.
   Police said Sithole confessed to a magistrate before his death,
implicating himself in several killings. Police reportedly were
investigating whether Sithole and the other suspects were ANC
guerrillas.
   About 100 ANC guerrillas and anti-apartheid activists have died
in police custody in the past 25 years.
   According to police, suicide by hanging has been the most common
cause of these deaths, but human rights groups have insisted
interrogators mistreated many of these prisoners.
   In other developments Wednesday:
   _ About 3,500 demonstrators in Cape Town peacefully marched on
police headquarters to present a petition condemning police actions
in a Jan. 23 protest, which was broken up by rubber bullets and
water cannon.
   _ In the central city of Bloemfontein, about 1,000 blacks
arrived by bus and van to protest against a boycott-breaking
English cricket team, which was in the second day of a three-day
match against a team of university players.
   _ Police said a policeman was among three people killed in
political violence in black townships around the port city of
Durban.
   _ About 4,500 blacks marched on municipal offices in the black
township of Daveyton, east of Johannesburg, smashing windows and
setting furniture afire, police said. The protest followed a rumor
that a child was killed when authorities dismantled squatter
shacks. Police said they had no evidence a child was killed.

machine-gun rounds at a Cuban-operated merchant ship suspected of
carrying drugs in the Gulf of Mexico today, but the vessel escaped
into Mexican waters, officials said.
   The 250-foot Panamanian-registered freighter Hermann took at
least two direct hits without stopping, said Coast Guard spokesman
Joe Gibson. There was no word on injuries.
   ``We were in international waters,'' Gibson said. ``We cannot
pursue vessels into other country's waters.''
   Gibson said the Coast Guard asked the Mexican government to
board the ship and inspect its cargo. Capt. Aristides Palma Palma,
harbormaster in Tampico, Mexico, said by telephone that the Hermann
would dock there later in the day.
   The Cuban Embassy in Mexico City charged that the Hermann was
attacked in Mexican waters, but that was denied by Mexico's Foreign
Ministry and the U.S. government.
   The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City said in a statement that the
vessel fit the profile of a narcotics-smuggling ship. It did not
elaborate.
   The Coast Guard fired 130 rounds from a 20mm cannon and 250 to
300 rounds of .60-caliber machine-gun fire, including warning
shots, Gibson said. The freighter was hit in the engine compartment
and at the rudder post, he said.
   Before firing, the Coast Guard asked Panama through diplomatic
channels for permission to use disabling fire and it was granted,
Gibson said. He said it is protocol to ask a ship's country of
registry for permission to stop a vessel.
   Cuba's official news agency Prensa Latina said the Hermann had a
cargo of 10 tons of chromium. It said the ship has a 12-man crew
and is operated by the Guamar Shipping Co. of Cuba.
   Before firing, Gibson said, the Coast Guard took elaborate steps
to stop the freighter, which was spotted by the cutter Chincoteague
early Tuesday and was followed until just before dawn today, when
it was 45 miles east of Tampico, on the central Mexican coast.
   ``We got on the radio, we asked them to stop, we used a signal
light, we used a blue light, we used a flag hoist, we sprayed water
onto the vessel and we sprayed water down into the stacks,'' Gibson
said.
   ``Nothing worked, so we fired warning shots over the bow. They
continued, and we asked the Panamanian government for permission to
use disabling fire. The Panamanian government said do it.''

<HEAD>Heavy Snow Means Starving Moose Calves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALMER, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>

   Many Susitna Valley moose calves weakened
by this winter's heavy snow are starving to death in yards and
driveways, and some people are feeding the animals despite caution
from wildlife biologists.
   ``I've got a couple moose in front of my house right now, and
the mama looks OK, but the baby is sure looking poorly. It looks
sick. It's frosted all over,'' said resident David Spain.
   Spain said a moose calf walked into the shop where he works as a
mechanic and died, after hanging around outside for four weeks.
   Snow is nearly 5 feet deep at Willow in the Valley 55 miles
north of Anchorage, the National Weather Service says.
   Moose numbers normally decline during severe winters because
young, weak animals must struggle harder to find food and move
through the snow.
   But the Susitna Valley has not had a winter this bad in years,
and the moose population was especially high when this year's heavy
snow began.
   The snow has also led to more moose deaths on highways. Police
logs have shown up to 22 moose accidentally killed in a single
night. There is no count of how many calves have died of starvation.
   ``We're so swamped with calls that if we get somebody's name and
get them down in our notebooks, we're lucky,'' said Fish and
Wildlife Protection Trooper Sgt. Richard Graham.
   Bill Collins, a Fish and Game wildlife biologist, said his
Palmer office receives a dozen calls a day from residents who want
to know what to do about hungry moose.
   ``Once the moose are fed, they are extremely reluctant to leave
that area,'' Collins said. ``When conditions improve, they'll still
stay around.''
   If the feeding area is near where people live, the moose can be
dangerous, Collins said.
   ``The more a wild animal becomes accustomed to human beings, the
more likely it is to bridge the gap between standing off and
staying away or thrashing someone,'' Collins said.
   He said a moose that had been fed tried to push its way into a
woman's house recently. In another case last week, a calf tried to
get into a house, then trampled a woman when she got out of her
car. Collins said the 300-pound calf threatened to attack him, too,
and he had to kill it.
   ``I've been hit and kicked down a couple of times already this
year,'' Graham said.
   If a calf cannot move, Graham shoots it, he said, because
otherwise it will only suffer and die slowly.
   Forest Richey said his pickup truck was attacked by a large bull
moose that wouldn't leave his driveway in Willow. Richey was trying
to push it out of the way when the moose got mad.
   ``I made the mistake of leaving enough distance that he could
turn around and charge, and he charged and he came right up over
the hood,'' Richey said.
   Richey and Spain both blame the fall cow moose hunting season
for lowering the survival rate of calves. Collins said calves whose
mothers were killed by cars, trains or hunters are less likely to
survive, because they do not have the larger parent to break a path
through the snow or defend them from dogs.
   Spain is a hunter and said his large family lives on the meat
that moose provide in September. But he said that is not why he is
worried about the moose now.
   ``I feel for the moose themselves right now,'' he said.
``They're having a hell of a time. And for the past 15 years they
haven't had a winter like this.
   ``A guy just needs to get out and look at them to see how bad
they are.''

<HEAD>Sandinistas Promise to Lift Exit Visa Requirement for Some</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Sandinista National
Liberation Front fired another salvo Wednesday in the election
campaign, promising to loosen exit visa requirements in a move sure
to gain sympathy among voters.
   Nicaragua, Cuba and Bolivia are believed to be the only
countries in the Western Hemisphere where citizens need
Soviet-style government permission to travel abroad.
   Following a promise this week by President Daniel Ortega to free
1,044 political prisoners, the exit visa announcement ``is just
another electioneering maneuver by the Sandinista government to
gain votes,'' said Luis Sanchez, spokesman for the United National
Opposition coalition, or UNO.
   Ortega is running for another six-year term in the Feb. 25
general elections against UNO's Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, his
top challenger.
   In promising to free the prisoners, Ortega took the wind out of
Mrs. Chamorro's sails, whose campaign is badly lagging behind a
vigorous Sandinista effort.
   Mrs. Chamorro had repeatedly promised to ``open the jails'' if
elected.
   Speaking to Finance Ministry workers, Interior Minister Tomas
Borge said the Sandinistas would introduce to the
Sandinista-dominated National Assembly a bill that would eliminate
the exit visa requirement for women over 18 and men over 25.
   The visas, which are intended in part to prevent draft dodgers
from leaving the country, will still be required for other
Nicaraguans. The announcement was meant to take some of the sting
out of the Sandinistas' refusal to do away with the draft.
   Mrs. Chamorro has promised to ban the draft, obligatory for two
years for all 16-year-old males. That is one of UNO's top drawing
cards, along with promises to inject new life into a moribund
economy.
   Ortega, however, has said the draft is needed to defend
Nicaragua against what he calls ``Yankee aggression'' and an
allegedly planned U.S. invasion that has failed to materialize in
more than 10 years of Sandinista rule.
   Many Nicaraguan parents have sent their sons abroad to live with
friends or relatives, rather than allowing them to be drafted.
   A report on Borge's speech, published Wednesday in the
pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario, did not say when the bill
on exit visas would be introduced, nor did it say when Borge met
with the workers.
   It was the first time news of such a bill was public.
Nicaragua's immigration department comes under the Interior
Ministry.
   When they ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza in July 1979, the
Sandinistas removed a restriction banning Nicaraguans from travel
to communist countries, but they kept the exit visa requirement.

   Ronald Reagan, criticized during his
administration for his response to the AIDS epidemic, says he's
become more understanding about the disease.
   ``We all grow and learn in our lives,'' Reagan says in a public
service announcement for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. ``And I've
learned that all kinds of people can get AIDS. Even children.''
   The 30-second television spot was directed by former ``Starsky
and Hutch'' star Paul Michael Glaser, whose wife and son have
tested positive for the AIDS virus and whose 7-year-old daughter
died of the disease.
   Elizabeth Glaser, one of the foundation's founders, was exposed
to the virus through a blood transfusion.
   The disease of AIDS is frightening ``not the people who have
it,'' Reagan says in the spot to be aired this month. ``You can't
catch AIDS from hugging someone.''
   ``I'm not asking you to send money,'' he says. ``I'm asking for
something more important. Your understanding. Maybe it's time we
all learned something new.''

   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has
named her week-old daughter Bakhtawar, which means ``one who brings
luck'' in Persian, it was announced Wednesday.
   The second child of Ms. Bhutto and husband, Azif Zardari, was
born Jan. 25 in the southern port city of Karachi. Ms. Bhutto was
the first elected leader of a modern government to give birth while
in office.
   The 36-year-old prime minister's first child, a son named
Bilawal, was born Sept. 21, 1988, two months before the first free
elections in 11 years that installed Ms. Bhutto as prime minister.
Ms. Bhutto campaigned until the final days before Bilawal's birth
and was back on the hustings a week later.
   Two days before her daughter's birth, the prime minister
traveled to a dusty rural village near Karachi to distribute
thousands of acres of government land to peasants.
   Opposition leaders were critical of the prime minister's
decision to have a second child, claiming the country would be
leaderless while she recovered.
   Ms. Bhutto transferred authority to her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, a
senior minister without portfolio, elected member of the National
Assembly and co-chairperson of the populist Pakistan People's Party.

   Comedian Redd Foxx has lost to the IRS an
expensive gold watch given him 13 years ago by the late Elvis
Presley.
   Foxx was ordered to hand over the watch, which attorneys said
has a value in the high six figures, during a hearing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court here.
   The IRS seized Foxx's Las Vegas home, several cars, personal
belongings and expensive jewelry in a raid on his home Nov. 28. The
Internal Revenue Service wants to sell the belongings to help pay
nearly $900,000 in taxes, penalties and interest it claims Foxx
owes the government.
   The IRS planned to auction the property last Saturday, but
Foxx's attorneys went to bankruptcy court last week and obtained a
30-day stay on the sale.
   His attorneys claim the IRS sale would conflict with the
bankruptcy court efforts to satisfy creditors.
   Foxx filed for bankruptcy in 1983 and some of his property has
been liquidated over a period of years to pay creditors.

   Rock star Prince's fondness for macaroni and
cheese and canned cake frosting was too much for his chef, who quit
after only a month on the job.
   ``He eats a lot of junk food. I have the feeling it's going to
catch up with him,'' Carmen Bonilla of Minneapolis said Wednesday
of the svelte Prince.
   Bonilla, 36, a professional chef for 10 years, said she began
working for Prince just before Christmas. Her last day on the job
was Wednesday.
   ``He hasn't had the opportunity to develop his palate,'' Bonilla
said of the reclusive rock star. ``He doesn't eat out very much
because he's shy and he hates the public. ... He wants the comfort
food he grew up on.''
   That means macaroni and cheese and cake mixes and canned
frosting, said Bonilla, who prefers cooking Mediterranean cuisine.
   ``Basically it was too restrictive for me as a personal chef,''
she said.
   Although he professes to be a vegetarian, Prince won't eat
salads and vegetables but he will eat chicken, likes fresh fish and
``adores'' pasta, Bonilla said.
   ``I was trying to do the middle-of-the-road stuff between being
a gourmet and opening a box,'' she said. ``I never got myself to
open a box.''
   Bonilla said she would serve an afternoon dinner to Prince and
actress Kim Basinger at Prince's Paisley Park Studios in the
Minneapolis suburb of Chanhassen. She described the 31-year-old
Prince as ``a very quiet, very shy type of person'' who ``likes to
keep people at a distance,'' while Basinger was ``real cordial''
and had ``great social skills.''
   Prince publicist Jill Willis declined comment on Bonilla's
resignation.

<HEAD>Paper Says Iran Ready to Pursue Hostage Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Kuwait newspaper said Iranian leaders believe
Westerners held by Shiite Moslem extremists in Lebanon have no more
political value and are willing to help secure their release.
   A senior Iranian envoy close to President Hashemi Rafsanjani
``recently met with an American personality in Geneva and discussed
the hostage issue with him,'' the daily Al-Qabas said in a dispatch
Tuesday from Paris.
   Rafsanjani and close aides ``are convinced the value of the
American and Western hostages is decreasing by the day,'' the paper
said, quoting West European sources it did not identify.
   ``The hostages are no longer a pressure or bargaining card,'' it
quoted the sources as saying.
   No independent confirmation was available, but speculation has
grown that Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists,
wanted the hostages freed as part of an effort to improve relations
with the West.
   It appears, however, that Rafsanjani's room for maneuver has
been curtailed by a power struggle with former Interior Minister
Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a radical with close links to the Lebanese
Shiites believed to hold most of the captives.
   Eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an
Italian and an Irishman are missing in Lebanon and believed held
hostage.
   Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.
   Al-Qabas said its sources attributed the shift in Iranian policy
to the refusal of governments to bargain for the hostages, the
changing political and security situation in Lebanon and
international developments caused by the changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``The Iranian leadership is apparently prepared to facilitate
the release of American hostages provided this will lead at a later
stage to a gradual improvement in Iranian-American relations,'' the
paper reported.
   It said the U.S.-Iranian meeting in Geneva was the most
important of several, and that the previous encounters took place
in Paris and a West German city left unidentified.
   None of the officials was identified, but Al-Qabas said the
Americans were diplomats or private citizens and the Iranian in
Geneva was ``formerly in charge of the file of Western hostages in
Lebanon and played a key role in the Iranian-French relations that
led to the release of French hostages.''
   Although it quoted the sources as saying they had no ``certain
information that the two sides have reached a final formula on the
fate of the hostages,'' the paper added:
   ``The sources do not exclude the possibility of the Americans
and Iranians having reached a secret formula whereby the American
and Western hostages will be freed in one batch or several batches,
provided the Bush administration met such a step by opening up to
Iran and starting a gradual normalization process between the two
countries.''

<HEAD>Bush to Call for Deeper Troop Cuts in Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush prepared to deliver a State of
the Union address tonight that administration sources said will
call for deeper cuts in Soviet and American troops in Europe.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Bush called Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to advise him of ``some
announcements'' he would have in tonight's speech. The White House
said Bush and Gorbachev discussed arms control.
   The proposed cuts would go beyond a troop-reduction plan that
Bush offered in 1989 and which is still under negotiation, said the
sources, who demanded anonymity. Last year's proposal would cut
troops on each side t 275,000, which would require a 30,000-person
reduction in U.S. combat troops and a 325,000-person reduction in
Soviet forces in Eastern Europe.
   CBS News reported that Bush would use the speech to unveil a
proposal to reduce U.S. and Soviet troops in the central zone of
Europe to 195,000, a drop of 80,000 from the 1989 proposal.
   Bush told reporters, ``The speech comes on at 9 o'clock tonight
and there's going to be a lot of surprises there _ maybe. I'm not
going to discuss in advance what I want to say. I want the surprise
factor.''
   ``There are some things that we don't discuss ahead of time,''
he said.
   Referring to Bush's call to Gorbachev, Baker said, ``It had to
do with some announcements that the president will have tonight in
his State of the Union message, and beyond that I am not going to
say anything further.''
   Similarly, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said,
``The president's State of the Union will deal with arms control,
but I cannot confirm nor deny'' any specifics of his proposal.
   Arms control aside, Bush told Republicans that his speech would
register objections to any cutback in Social Security taxes, and
proclaim the nation in good health.
   Bush also said he would set new goals in education, and sources
said he would call for American students to be first in the world
by the year 2000 in science and mathematics, two areas where they
have ranked near the bottom in international testing.
   Bush will address a joint session of Congress in a nationally
broadcast appearance at 9 p.m. EST. It will be his maiden State of
the Union address, although he went before Congress with a budget
and deficit-reduction package last February.
   The president gave a preview of his speech to Republican members
of Congress during a morning meeting at the White House.
   Later, House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said he was
happy that Bush said he would use the speech to voice opposition to
a plan by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to roll back a
Social Security tax increase that took effect Jan. 1.
   Referring to Moynihan's proposal, Michel said, ``It just means
it's a no-no as far as our party's concerned. We've made that
decision earlier on to fund this program adequately into the next
century. And to do violence to that ... just really undermines our
credibility.''
   The administration has argued that Moynihan's plan would lead to
either an increase in other taxes or a reduction in Social Security
benefits.
   Moynihan has said his proposal was prompted by concern that the
growing Social Security trust fund reserves are being used to mask
the true size of the federal deficit. He says the financial
soundness of the system would be protected under his proposal and
there would be no risk to benefits.
   At the top of Bush's wish list for lawmakers are leftover bills
dealing with clean air, crime, child care and cuts in capital gains
tax rates.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu said chances for action
are better this year because of the November elections.
   ``I think all of a sudden about April or May, it will dawn on
Congress that it's a congressional election, not a presidential
election year, and that failures to get things done will be seen as
failures of the Democrat leadership in the House, the Democrat
leadership in the Senate,'' he said.
   ``And I think at that time, maybe we'll get them back to a
bipartisan perspective and get some legislation passed,'' Sununu
added.
   Bush also has the momentum of strong support from Americans.
Surveys taken after the invasion of Panama showed Bush with a
job-approval rating of 79 to 81 percent, higher than former
President Reagan ever attained.
   Much of the suspense of Bush's address was dampened by the
unveiling of his $1.2 trillion budget plan, which outlined new
initiatives where he wants to spend more money and areas where he
wants to cut.
   ``So all the details of the programs are really on the table
right now,'' Sununu said.
   Generally speaking, Bush requested more money for education,
space, the environment and drugs while proposing cuts for Medicare,
college student loans, mass transit and farm subsidies.
   White House officials said there were no major initiatives or
surprises remaining for Bush's speech.
   ``Obviously, we don't want to overstate expectations, don't want
anyone to overexpand an agenda,'' said Sununu.
   The challenge to improve students' math and science skills was
hinted at in Bush's budget.
   Without mentioning the math and science goal, the budget
proposes $230 million _ a 70 percent increase _ in funds for states
to improve the abilities of teachers in those two disciplines.
   In addition, National Science Foundation programs for science,
math and engineering education would receive a $100 million
increase, to $460 million, under Bush's proposal.
   Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos, citing results of an
international comparative study of students in more than a dozen
industrialized nations, complained in a speech that U.S. students
consistently ranked near the bottom in math and science
   Bush has previewed his address with a series of speeches this
year, warning the democratic reforms in Eastern Europe will not
produce a ``peace dividend'' of defense savings for the United
States.
   While Democrats are hoping to cut Pentagon spending, Bush said
at one outing he would not ``naively cut the muscle out of our
defense posture.''

   For just $20, you can be mayor for a day at
Wray.
   The power and prestige of governing this northeastern Colorado
town of 2,200 is available for a $20 donation to the Wray
Rehabilitation and Activities Center. You don't even have to be a
resident to qualify for the one-day tenure.
   Dan Wisdom, a career Navy officer in Hawaii, purchased the
mayor's duties Wednesday and declared it ``Pat Your Neighbor on the
Back Day.''
   More than 60 days have been sold, said Mike Wisdom, head of the
recreation board and brother of Wednesday's mayor. ``Mostly, people
are buying their birthdays,'' he said.
   The center is a $4 million project, including $1.8 million in
building funds, that the community is funding through donations and
matching grants. Construction starts in April.

   President Bush called Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev today to provide him with advance word on several
announcements he will make in his State of the Union address,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said.
   Among them, administration sources told The Associated Press, is
a proposal for deeper cutbacks in U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe.
   NATO and the Warsaw Pact are negotiating over a proposal by Bush
last year to establish ceilings of 275,000. But since then, Soviet
allies in Eastern and Central Europe have called for Soviet troop
withdrawals, and Moscow appears receptive.
   As a result, said the sources, who demanded anonymity, Bush will
call for even deeper reductions.
   Baker, meanwhile, again discounted as ``just a rumor'' a
television report that Gorbachev would surrender his leadership of
the Soviet Communist Party.
   ``We said yesterday that we thought that that was just a rumor,
and indeed it proved to be just a rumor,'' Baker said. ``I can't
make judgments about rumors, whether they surface in the Soviet
Union or over here. It was a rumor.''
   There was no ``direct'' discussion of the report in Bush's
telephone call to Gorbachev, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   ``It had to do with some announcements that the president will
have tonight in his State of the Union message, and beyond that I
am not going to say anything further,'' Baker said in a brief
exchange with reporters at the State Department.
   Gorbachev earlier today emphatically denied the report by the
Cable News Network.
   Fitzwater said, ``The president called him this morning to talk
about arms control. I don't know how long. (It was) early this
morning.''
   Asked if they had talked about the rumors Gorbachev might
surrender his party post, Fitzwater said, ``The president said
there was no direct discussion of that.''
   Baker, who is going to Moscow next week, will see Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze _ and possibly Gorbachev _ on Feb.
8-9. The talks were rescheduled a second time to avoid interfering
with a meeting of the party's Central Committee.
   The postponement coincided with a report by CNN that Gorbachev
had spent the past eight days at his country home, considering
whether to resign as head of the Soviet Communist Party.
   ``No one has said this, and I certainly didn't make any such
statement,'' the Soviet president and party general secretary said.
``Any such suggestions are groundless.''
   Asked about the resignation report during a photo session at the
start of a Kremlin meeting with President-elect Fernando Collor de
Mello of Brazil, Gorbachev said, ``I have no intention of doing
so.''
   Bush administration officials and intelligence sources told The
Associated Press there has been speculation for weeks that
Gorbachev would yield his party post _ while retaining the
presidency _ but they had no information he would take the step.
   ``All I can tell you ... is that it's a rumor, and therefore
it's not something that I think that we should respond to or react
to,'' Baker told reporters on his way to a meeting with President
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya. ``We're following the story, as I know
you are, and we'll have a comment if we ever determine it's
something more than just a rumor.''
   Baker said American diplomats in Moscow ``know just about the
same thing that all the rest of us know right now _ that there's a
rumor out there to this effect, and that's all we know.''
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told reporters the
administration has been ``trying for the last few hours to try and
get some additional assessments, but I don't have anything at all.''
   Issues to be discussed by Baker and Shevardnadze include arms
control and the war in Afghanistan between the Soviet-backed
government and U.S.-armed rebels.
   Initially, Baker was to go to Moscow on Feb. 6-7. Then the date
was changed to Feb. 7-8. And on Tuesday the State Department
announced the shift to Feb. 8-9, saying it was suggested by the
U.S. side.
   ``It simply makes more sense to have the Soviets complete their
plenum before beginning this important ministerial,'' said Margaret
D. Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman.
   Baker also is expected to make a brief visit to Czechoslovakia,
although there has been no announcement on that.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported the delay of Baker's visit
in a one-paragraph story from Washington but gave no reason.
   CNN, quoting a ``well-informed and usually reliable'' party
source, said from Moscow that the re-emergence of Gorbachev on
television on Tuesday did not rule out a dramatic resignation when
the policy-setting Central Committee meets next Monday and Tuesday.
   Before the TV appearance on Tuesday, Gorbachev was last seen in
public Jan. 20 explaining why Soviet troops had been sent to the
Azerbaijan republic.
   According to the unnamed source, Gorbachev had resisted sending
troops into Baku, the capital of the republic, and was suffering
severe depression over the action, CNN said.

<HEAD>Report Says Slain Drug Suspect Had Cocaine in System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspected drug dealer who was beaten to death
while in the custody of six undercover detectives used cocaine
shortly before he died, a medical examiner's report said.
   ``He had used cocaine probably within two to three hours prior
to the time that he died,'' Dr. Lee Hearn, chief toxicologist for
the Dade medical examiner's office, said Tuesday.
   There was cocaine in Leonardo Mercado's urine, nasal passages,
blood and brain, the report said.
   ``The concentrations are not by any means exceptional,'' Hearn
said. ``They're actually quite low.''
   But defense attorneys say that whatever the amount, the cocaine
could have been a factor in the confrontation between Mercado and
the officers.
   Mercado died Dec. 16, 1988, while in the custody of six officers
from the street narcotics unit. The officers go on trial April 2 on
federal charges of violating Mercado's civil rights.
   Witnesses told investigators that officers found Mercado on the
street, pulled him inside his house and hit, kicked and beat him.
   The finding of cocaine in Mercado's system is ``an extremely
significant point for the defense,'' said Richard Sharpstein, an
attorney for one of the officers.
   But Hearn said the presence of cocaine in Mercado's bloodstream
does not mean he was prone to violence.
   ``He probably was feeling some effects from cocaine, but
probably not very intensely at that point,'' Hearn said.
``Different people react different ways. ... Some people become
violent, some just become happy. You really can't say based solely
on a toxicological test result.''

   The national Operation Rescue organization is
shutting down because of debt but local affiliates nationwide will
continue their anti-abortion efforts, founder Randall Terry said
Wednesday.
   Terry made the announcement at a news conference a day after he
was released from a Georgia prison where he had spent nearly four
months in custody on charges of criminal trespass and unlawful
assembly.
   He said a $50,000 fine imposed by a New York court in a lawsuit
filed by the National Organization for Women hurt Operation
Rescue's fund-raising efforts and helped put the group $70,000 in
debt.
   The fine is being appealed, but the judgment in the New York
case ``unfortunately has driven us to the brink of bankruptcy,'' he
said.
   Terry said that because of the fine the organization had been
unable to raise money to pay salaries and carry on the operations
of the Binghamton, N.Y., headquarters, which had employed 23 people.
   ``It is unprecedented in American history for government to go
after any group with such Draconian fines,'' he said. ``As a result
of the lawsuit, we don't have any option but to close our doors.''
   However, Terry said, the 125 local Operation Rescue groups
across the country will continue their direct-action efforts to
shut down abortion clinics.
   ``We are confident these groups will continue doing what they're
doing,'' he said. ``The movement is bigger than the office in
Binghamton and will carry on with or without us.''
   Terry was released Tuesday from a Fulton County, Ga.,
minimum-security prison camp after an anonymous person paid his
$500 fine and a $50 special assessment.
   He said he did not know who had paid the fine. ``I'm happy I'm
out,'' he said. ``I'm glad I did the time ... and I'm also glad I'm
out.''
   Terry said his immediate plans ``are to go home and spend some
time ministering to my wife and family.''
   But he said he plans to continue his anti-abortion activities.
``You'll see me out there kicking,'' he said. ``I'm not dead. Once
I get my bearings, I will still be speaking, traveling.''
   He said he stopped in Washington, at a conference of religious
broadcasters, on his way home because he wanted to express his
outrage at the prison sentences that are being handed out to
members of Operation Rescue around the country.
   Pro-life activists, he said, are being jailed more often and
held longer than demonstrators for other causes.
   ``This is politics,'' he said. ``There's no other explanation.''
   Terry, a born-again Christian and former car salesman, was
arrested during an Operation Rescue demonstration outside the
Atlanta Surgi-Center in 1988. He was ordered to pay the fine, agree
to stay out of metropolitan Atlanta for two years and abide by
Georgia law.
   Terry refused and was jailed Oct. 5, saying he was prepared to
serve out the two-year sentence.
   Operation Rescue is a loose-knit organization Terry founded in
1987, three years after he and his wife began standing outside a
Binghamton clinic trying to discourage women from having abortions.

   South Korea expects to sign agreements
for the withdrawal of 3,000 more U.S. forces in 1990, a senior
official indicated Wednesday.
   Such agreements would bring reductions to 5,000 this year, to a
total of roughly 38,000.
   All of the American personnel withdrawn are expected to be
non-combatants, said the government official, who discussed the
issue on condition he not be identified.
   U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said earlier this week
three U.S. Air Force bases in South Korea would be closed and 2,000
air support personnel withdrawn in a cost-saving effort.
   Cheney's announcement signaled the first U.S. military cutback
in South Korea in more than 10 years.
   ``It's a readjustment. We don't think the U.S. is pulling out,''
said the Korean official, who has high-level government
responsibilities with both the foreign and defense ministeries.
   He said the government views the basic U.S.-South Korea defense
agreement as being untouched and said Korean officials are
confident further reductions will involve only support personnel,
not combat-ready troops.
   The official said the two nations are expected to formalize an
agreement later this year. He indicated that would bring U.S.
forces to 1980 troop strength of roughly 38,000, or 5,000 less than
today's number.
   The U.S. 2nd Infantry Division, the only American division in
South Korea, is deployed along the Demilitarized Zone separating
North Korea and South Korea, and is not expected to be affected by
cuts, he said.
   The 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea are under a
mutual defense pact to deter aggression from communist North Korea.
South Koreans view national security as their top national priority
and citizens have been jittery over the prospect of American
withdrawals.
   The peninsula was divided into the communist North and
capitalist South in 1945 and the two sides fought a bloody
three-year war in the early 1950s that ended with an armistice, but
not a peace treaty.
   Cheney is to visit Seoul Feb. 14 for negotiations with his
Korean counterparts and a discussion of ground troops is expected
to be on the agenda. U.S. and Korean officials said no decisions
would be made on troop reductions without the agreement of both
nations.
   The last U.S. cutbacks were in the late 1970s when several
hundred troops were withdrawn to fulfill a campaign promise made by
President Jimmy Carter.

   The jury that convicted a woman of
suffocating one of two infant daughters she claimed were abducted
three years apart by masked gunmen deliberated today whether the
crime qualifies for the death penalty.
   Assistant State's Attorney Donald Weber argued that Paula Marie
Sims' crime was especially brutal and cruel _ the grounds necessary
to bring the death penalty.
   But defense attorney Donald Groshong told jurors, ``In the
pecking order of evil ... smothering is usually considered more
merciful than other forms of killing.''
   Mrs. Sims, 30, was convicted Tuesday in the April 29 death of
6-week-old Heather Lee Sims.
   A finding by the jury that Mrs. Sims is eligible for the death
penalty would send the trial into a third phase, in which jurors
would decide whether to actually sentence her to death.
   Groshong today argued that Ms. Sims maintains her innocence, and
he added, ``We cannot say the death of this child was premeditated,
prolonged or torturous.''
   Mrs. Sims claimed a gunman abducted the infant from the family's
southern Illinois home in Alton. In 1986, Mrs. Sims gave a nearly
identical account in the death of 13-day-old Loralei Marie. The
Simses were living in rural Brighton at the time. Mrs. Sims has not
been charged with killing that child.
   The jury deliberated for 10 hours over two days before reaching
the verdict. Mrs. Sims broke down as guards led her back to jail.
   Weber said he thought the jury was strongly influenced by
evidence that Mrs. Sims and her husband, 37-year-old Robert, wanted
only male children.
   ``She didn't like little girls and neither did Robert,'' Weber
said.
   Sims has not been charged in either case.
   But Weber said because of the verdict against Mrs. Sims,
prosecutors are considering seeking indictments against him. Sims
and Groshong refused to comment.
   Mrs. Sims faces trial on charges of obstruction of justice and
concealment of a homicide in Loralei's death. Mrs. Sims has been
jailed since July.
   Sims has had custody of the couple's son, Randy, who turns 2 on
Thursday. The trial was moved to Peoria from Edwardsville because
of intense pretrial publicity.

<HEAD>Minister Concerned Over Shamir's Remarks After Visit to Moscow</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A minister from a pivotal religious party on
Wednesday admonished Israeli leaders against making comments that
could delay Soviet Jewish immigration.
   Religious Affairs Minister Zevulun Hammer was reacting to a
statement made by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who suggested that
Israel needed to keep the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to
settle an expected wave of Soviet immigrants.
   Speaking to reporters one day after his return from the Soviet
Union, Hammer said he did not expect the Soviet immigration wave to
be halted because of Shamir's comments.
   But he said, ``We have to act with much caution, and we have to
avoid saying anything that could cause any kind of delay in
emigration.''
   Soviet and U.S. officials oppose resettlement of immigrants in
the occupied lands, saying it is an obstacle to making peace with
Arabs. The Soviet Union broke ties with Israel after the Jewish
state captured the territories from Jordan and Egypt during the
1967 Middle East War.
   Low-level relations were resumed in 1987.
   Hammer is a member of the National Religious Party, which is
crucial in deciding whether the political left or right could rule
in a coalition government.
   It had been in coalition with the left-leaning Labor Party for
the country's first 30 years until it sided with the right-wing
Likud bloc after Likud's victory in 1977 national elections.
   Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader and Shamir's main political
rival, told a private meeting of the inner Cabinet on Wednesday
that Shamir's remark was ``a fatal mistake regarding immigration,
and I can hardly restrain myself from saying this in public,''
Israel TV reported.
   Hammer said Anatoly Adamishin, a Soviet deputy foreign minister,
told him Shamir's remarks had ``created difficulties ... at home
and abroad.''
   The Soviet Union issued an official protest of Shamir's
statement. In response, a top Shamir aide said Israel had no policy
of directing immigrants to the occupied territories, where
Palestinians are fighting for an independent state.
   Israeli officials say the immigrants are free to settle either
in Israel or in the occupied lands, where 1.7 million Palestinians
live.
   Meanwhile, former Soviet refuseniks appealed to the Israeli
government to implement ``the evacuation of Soviet Jewry'' because
of alleged growing anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union.
   About 50 refuseniks, who waited years to obtain exit visas from
the Soviet Union, protested across from Shamir's office in
Jerusalem.
   ``We need to evacuate them because they are threatened. There is
a real danger,'' said Ida Nudel, who waged a 16-year fight for an
exit visa before finally being allowed to come to Israel in 1987.
``Unfortunately we know everything retrospectively. We remember
what happened in Germany. ... It's the same conditions today.''
   Israel has said it expects up to 300,000 Soviet Jews to
immigrate to Israel in the next three years. In January, 4,600
Soviet Jews came to Israel, according to the government.
   Workers at the Absorption Ministry, which handles the influx,
declared a 24-hour strike beginning at midnight Wednesday. Hanna
Bazana, chairwoman of the workers' committee, said the strike was
to demand salary increases and more workers since ``350 workers
cannot absorb 100,000 immigrants expected.''
   The Absorption Ministry said it would employ temporary workers
to handle two planeloads of immigrants due to arrive early Thursday.

<HEAD>Expanded Ruling Party to Seek Better Relations With Moscow</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former opposition leader now allied
with the governing party said Wednesday he would seek better
relations with the Soviet Union as a means of easing tension with
North Korea.
   Kim Young-sam, whose Reunification Democratic Party joined
another opposition group last week in a merger with the governing
Democratic Justice Party, said better relations with Communist
allies of North Korea would help lead to reunification.
   He plans to visit the Soviet Union in mid-March. Kim's comments
reflected the policy of President Roh Tae-woo, who has sought
better relations with North Korea's allies in hopes they would
preach moderation in Pyongyang.
   After years in the opposition, Kim became a government leader
overnight when his party and the New Democratic Republican Party
agreed to the merger. They ranked second and third in the
opposition behind the leftist Party for Peace and Prosperity led by
Kim Dae-jung.
   At a news conference Wednesday, Kim Young-sam said: ``I would
actively push the ... policy of improving relations with the Soviet
Union, China and other socialist nations, thus laying a solid
foundation for national unifification.'' The merger is to become
formal in mid-February, but already is considered in effect. The
alliance is tentatively named the Democratic Liberal Party.
   Because of the merger, Kim Young-sam has become a possible
successor to Roh, whose single five-year term expires in early 1993.
   He said he proposed the merger to Roh last year as a way of
ending South Korea's faction-ridden politics ``once and for all.''
That contradicted widespread speculation that the Roh's party
initiated the merger.
   Newspapers said Kim, 62, probably will meet in Moscow with
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top officials interested
in improving relations with South Korea.
   An aide said privately: ``Last June, Mr. Kim went to Moscow as
an opposition leader, but this time he is going there as a
potential ruler ... and I am sure they would consider the change in
his status.''
   News reports said Kim also might speak with North Korean leaders
while in Moscow, but the aide denied it. During the June trip to
Moscow, Kim met with Ho Dam, former foreign minister of North Korea.
   South Korea has established full diplomatic relations with
Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia and has consular ties with the
Soviet Union, with hopes of raising them to the ambassadorial level.
   Korea was divided in 1945, at the end of World War II. The two
nations fought a three-year war that ended in 1953, but no peace
treaty has been signed.

   Members of the Soviet Union's national
legislature will visit the Pentagon and several U.S. military
installations as part of a 12-day trip to the United States, the
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee said Wednesday.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said the delegation from the defense and
state security committee of the Supreme Soviet will arrive Feb. 7
for a trip similar to the one members of the House panel took to
the Soviet Union last August.
   Among the stops on the Soviets' itinerary is a tour of the
Pentagon and a meeting with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Los
Alamos National Laboratories in New Mexico, the Midgetman II
missile site and B-1B bomber, the Strategic Air Command at Offutt
Air Force Base in Nebraska, the U.S. Navy base in Norfolk, Va., and
the General Dynamics F-16 fighter plant.
   The Soviets will also visit the Army armored division at Fort
Hood, Texas, and the Army chemical weapons facility at Fort
McClellan, Ala. _ two sites slated for closing or realignment in
Cheney's base closure plan.
   The Soviet delegation will be headed by Vladimir Lavrentyevich
Lapygin, the committee's chairman, and Col. Valeriy Nikolayevich
Ochirov, the vice chairman.
   Lapygin participated in the design of the Soviet space shuttle.
Ochirov is an Air Force officer and helicopter pilot who holds his
country's highest decoration for valor.
   The delegation also will visit the Kennedy Space Center and
Disneyworld in Florida and New York City.

   President Bush on Wednesday honored the 25th
anniversary of VISTA, saying the service organization's volunteers
are embarked on ``a great mission.''
   Bush joined his wife Barbara at a brief ceremony in the White
House to swear in five new volunteers in Volunteers in Service to
America (VISTA), the domestic counterpart of the Peace Corps.
   ``You impart to so many disadvantaged Americans the means to
build pride, to earn a degree or skill, to believe in themselves,''
Bush told a group of VISTA guests.
   He called the volunteers ``true activists.
   ``You don't often see them because they're off helping others in
the unlikliest places. You don't often hear from them because
they're too modest to brag. And you don't often notice them at work
because theirs is a quiet mission.''
   Since it was started under President Johnson, VISTA has
dispatched some 100,000 volunteers to community projects across the
country. The first projects, which began Jan. 31, 1965, were in
Appalachia and among migrant farm workers in California.
   Today, some 3,000 volunteers work in 660 VISTA projects in the
50 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
   Their mission, Bush said in brief remarks, is ``to guide the
young, to comfrort the sick, to encourage the downtrodden, to teach
the skills which may lead to a more rewarding life.
   VISTA projects include working with the homeless, senior
citizens, iliteracy programs, alcohol and drug abuse prevention,
agricultural cooperatives and job counseling.
   Attending the White House ceremony were Sen. Jay Rockefeller,
D-W.Va., and Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson, both
former VISTA volunteers.

   Mediators arrived Wednesday to prepare
peace talks between Armenian and Azerbaijani representatives that
bypass the Kremlin and underscore the growing importance of the
grassroots movements in the Baltics.
   Rein Veidemann and Arvo Junte of the Estonian People's Front
arrived from Tallinn, while Vytautas Landsbergis, head of a similar
group in Lithuania, was expected later.
   Nine mediators are to take part in the talks in Riga, the
Latvian capital, organized by the Baltic Council, a grouping of the
region's people's fronts.
   The discussions are aimed at ending bloodshed in clashes between
Armenians and Azerbaijanis that have wracked the Soviet Caucasus
for two years. The tension escalated Jan. 13 when Azerbaijanis
attacked Armenians in the Azerbaijani capital Baku, and when Soviet
troops stormed into the city a week later. Officials report nearly
200 deaths.
   Official news reports Wednesday said no shots were fired in Baku
the previous night and that 80 percent of the businesses in the
capital and other major cities of Azerbaijan were working. The
others are on strike. Among the areas plagued by work stoppages is
the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, the region in
Azerbaijan that is populated primarily by Armenians.
   The Baltic Council stepped in because the Kremlin's efforts to
resolve the bloody ethnic dispute have largely failed.
   Latvian organizers say two representatives of Azerbaijan's
People's Front are expected to reach Riga Thursday, while the
three-man delegation from the Armenian All-National Movement is
being hindered by lack of flights out of their capital, Yerevan.
   Because of the transportation problems, organizers do not know
when the talks will start.
   The Baltic Council, which groups People's Front leaders from
Lithuania, Lativa and Estonia, is scheduled to meet Thursday to
prepare for the talks.
   The Armenians and Azerbaijanis have agreed to discuss the
presence of Soviet troops in their republics, refugees and other
humanitarian questions.
   The Latvian Women's League, a faction within the People's Front,
is pressing the Soviet military for news on the whereabouts and
well-being of the estimated 500 native Latvians sent into
Azerbaijan to keep order.
   ``If the state can't resolve those problems, why should an
18-year-old lose his blood?'' asked Anita Stankevic, a Women's
League representative.
   ``We don't want our sons serving against their will in other
republics,'' she said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Wednesday denied a report
he might resign as head of the Communist Party while remaining
Soviet president, and a leading newspaper called him too valuable
to risk losing.
   Another newspaper, the party daily Pravda, urged authorities to
strengthen the powers of the presidency to protect Gorbachev from
efforts to oust him.
   Correspondents covering Gorbachev's meeting with Brazilian
president-elect Fernando Collor de Mello asked about a Western
television report that he was considering quitting the party
leadership.
   ``All this is groundless,'' Gorbachev said in remarks that led
the Soviet television news Wednesday night. ``It is in someone's
interest to propagate such things.''
   He added that similar rumors are becoming common in the Soviet
Union, and ``it demonstrates that we are a different country, a
different society. Everything is discussed, and discussed openly.''
   Gorbachev has strengthened the presidency and tried to shift
power from the ruling Communist Party to the elected government.
But it is far from clear whether the reforms have gone far enough
for him to dare relinquishing the top post in the party, which has
been the source of power for all previous Soviet leaders.
   The Pravda article, based on a debate among prominent figures,
appeared to tell readers that party power still is paramount and
that the presidency is not strong enough to be the country's main
leadership post.
   The political turmoil comes while the Soviet Union is torn by
nationalist and ethnic violence in Azerbaijan, drives for
independence in several republics and an economic crisis.
   It also comes just five days before what is expected to be a
fiery meeting of the party's Central Committee _ the one body with
the official power to remove Gorbachev as party leader.
   Progressives hope to present an alternative party program at the
meeting. In addition, it is likely to be the hard-liners' last
chance to make a power play before the voters decide on their
future in local and republic-level elections in February and March.
   Gorbachev told journalists he had just returned from the south,
apparently referring to his retreat on the Black Sea, where he was
preparing for the Central Committee meeting.
   Cable News Network reported Tuesday, in an account attributed to
an unidentified party source, that Gorbachev had spent eight days
sequestered outside Moscow while he considered quitting.
   President Bush telephoned Gorbachev Wednesday, but White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there was no ``direct'' discussion
of the rumors. Fitzwater said the two leaders talked about arms
control.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III discounted the TV network
report as ``just a rumor.''
   In Moscow, U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock received an audience in
the Kremlin, the Tass news agency said. However, it said he and
Politburo member Lev Zaikov talked about Soviet-U.S. relations.
Matlock said the meeting was scheduled months earlier and the
topics were ``not connected to any other events.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov also denied the
reports.
   ``In the long run, power will belong completely to the soviets
(elected councils) and the party will exercise its influence
through its members in the soviets, which is the usual way for
every democracy,'' Gerasimov said.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda, the party's youth daily, noted that the
Communist Party is splitting into factions, under such forces as
the independence movements in the Baltics, the violence in
Azerbaijan and recent ousters of local party chiefs by impatient
reformers in Tyumen, Volgograd and Chernigov.
   ``To fix on pseudo-unity is a dangerous thing, at least because
responsibility for everything boomerangs to the very top,'' said
the article signed by managing editor Alexander Drozdov.
   ``We cannot, we do not have the right to risk Gorbachev, simply
because he inherited such a heavy ideological and personnel
burden,'' he continued, referring to hard-line holdovers from the
Communist Party's decades of dictatorship.
   ``Today only he is in a position to become the center of gravity
and a mediator between the many political and social forces,''
Drozdov wrote.
   Drozdov also said in his front-page article that ``it is high
time for all influential participants in the political process to
sit down at a `roundtable,''' in obvious reference to negotiations
in Poland, in which Communists agreed to loosen their control over
the country. The talks led to the election of the Soviet bloc's
first non-Communist prime minister.
   Drozdov said the people's fronts, which in some Soviet republics
rival the party in public support, ``should be included in the
orbit of the government and political life on an equal footing with
the ruling party.''
   Drozdov told The Associated Press other editors cut from his
article a suggestion that Gorbachev divide his posts, retaining the
presidency and surrendering the party leadership. He said in an
interview he believes this issue will come to the fore soon, and
that ``as president, he would have much more trust than as head of
the party, of this party.''
   Drozdov declined to say who changed it, but other sources said
the decision was made inside the newspaper, not from higher up.
   As printed, the editorial said simply, ``In the end, he is our
president. And more than anything, he is our president.''
   In Pravda's report on a discussion by four scholars, historian
Yevgeny Ambartsumov said Gorbachev appeared unable to take decisive
action because of the threat to his position. Ambartsumov said the
country's president has few legal guarantees of his position, even
though the Congress of People's Deputies elected Gorbachev last May
to a five-year term.
   ``There is no guarantee that the Congress of People's Deputies,
in a left or right mood, would not demand his replacement,''
Ambartsumov said. Theoretically, he added, the Communist Party
could recall him as well, because Gorbachev was elected to one of
the party's 100 guaranteed parliamentary seats.
   Parliament spokesman Eduard Kovalev said lawmakers are
considering a law exempting the president from recall.
   Lawyer Mikhail Krutogolov referred in Pravda to the Communist
Party as the ``fourth power'' of the Soviet Union, whose authority
is greater than the judiciary, the legislature or the government's
executive branch.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II urged young Chadians on
Wednesday to fight the temptation of the city and concentrate
instead on farming their thirsty land to help Africa overcome its
poverty.
   The pontiff, nearing the end of his African tour, rode to the
Sarh hippodrome in the back of an open pickup truck along dusty
streets lined with mango trees.
   Women dressed in brightly printed cloth bearing the likeness of
the pope greeted him with ululations typical of the sub-Saharan, or
Sahel region.
   ``Learn the old and the new methods, work to create productive
fields and resist the temptation to abandon the land for an
uncertain future in the cities,'' the pontiff told a crowd of some
10,000 who gathered in the southern agricultural city of 700,000
people.
   The pope was accompanied by Monsignor Mathias Ngarteri, the only
Chadian bishop.
   Earlier in the day in the cotton-growing town of Moundou, John
Paul encouraged young Chadians to join the priesthood. There are 26
Chadian priests and 153 foreign priests in Chad.
   The pope also praised the labors of the expatriate priests and
missionaries who established the first Roman Catholic foothold in
Chad 60 years ago in Moundou.
   In addition to its pastoral activities, the church in Chad is
deeply involved in education and rural development.
   In a speech welcoming the pope Tuesday, President Hissene Habre,
a Moslem and former guerrilla leader, made a point of thanking the
expatriate priests and nuns working as teachers, nurses and rural
extension agents.
   Development aid officials say Chad, one of the world's 10
poorest nations whose fragile economy was shattered by more than a
decade of civil strife, is nevertheless capable of feeding itself,
given sufficient rainfall.
   U.S. AID officials said last year's harvest of 800,000 tons of
cereal grains, including mainstays sorghum and millet, is about
enough to feed the nation.
   Chad was the final stop on John Paul's visit to the Sahel. He
also visited Mali, Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, and Burkina Faso.
   Since his first visit to the drought-plagued Sahel a decade ago,
John Paul has repeatedly called on wealthy nations to help the
Africans of the region overcome their poverty.
   On Thursday, the pontiff is to deliver a speech at a Roman
Catholic-funded development planning center in the Chadian capital,
N'Djamena, in which he is expected to stress once again that the
developed world must not leave Africa behind.
   Before leaving for Rome, he will meet with Moslem leaders.
   About 50 percent of Chad's estimated 5.5 million inhabitants are
Moslems. There are 400,000 baptized Roman Catholics.

<HEAD>TV News Anchors Reported Missing Are Found to Have Run Off
Together</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WACO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The story of two local television anchors
reported missing but later found to have left town together is a
hot topic in this small city.
   When Wendy Sheldon, a weekday anchor of KWTX-TV, didn't show for
work on Friday, her husband, a production manager at the station,
reported her missing.
   Mike Reeder, the weekend anchor, also was reported missing by
the station manager. His wife told police that some of his clothes
were missing.
   After the Waco Tribune-Herald published a news item Sunday based
on the police blotter, the station announced on the air later that
day that Ms. Sheldon had called to say she was fine _ and also that
she was accompanied by Reeder, whose company car had been found
abandoned.
   Local officials said the two were in Albuquerque, N.M. Neither
had returned to work Wednesday.
   At first, some residents of this Bible-belt city _ home to
Baptist-run Baylor University _ wondered if it was all a publicity
stunt, said a clerk at the Sears catalog center who would identify
herself only as Mary.
   But as the Waco Tribune-Herald published updates on the case,
that thought diminished, she said.
   Then on Tuesday the incident was featured on the nationally
syndicated show ``A Current Affair.''
   ``I thought that was hilarious _ `a current affair,''' said a
Waco woman who works at the Texas State Technical Institute who
would identify herself only as Jan. ``But I can't understand why
anybody outside of Waco cares.''
   A deputy court clerk for McClennan County said the disappearance
has the courthouse abuzz, and she expects she may be indirectly
involved at some point.
   ``None of those involved have come in here yet,'' said the
clerk, who handles divorce case filings. ``But it wouldn't surprise
me.''
   Sammy Citrano, the general manager of the Elite Cafe, said Ms.
Sheldon and Reeder were occasional customers and ``both good
people.''
   ``It's not that big a deal. It's their personal lives,'' Citrano
said Wednesday. ``They're just somebody that got caught.''
   Citrano said both were respected and that Ms. Sheldon was active
in community service projects.
   An administrative assistant at the Baylor University Baptist
Student Center said although the town's many church people carry a
lot of influence, she has heard only comments of curiosity and
sympathy and anticipates no push to have the anchors taken off the
air.
   ``We have tolerance _ a lot of tolerance,'' said the assistant,
who would not give her name.
   She said many people who know the two and their families were
concerned about their well-being and think they are being dragged
through the mud.
   Virgil Teter, vice president for news at KWTX-TV, declined to
say whether the two would retain their jobs.
   Police in Waco, a city of about 112,000 people between Dallas
and Austin, said they have removed Ms. Sheldon from the missing
persons files.
   Dennis O'Brien, the producer of ``A Current Affair,'' told the
Waco newspaper the show will continue covering the anchors'
disappearance.

<HEAD>After Public Outcry, Police Ordered to Preserve All Files</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday ordered police
and security officers nationwide to halt any destruction of files
and other official records.
   The order, issued by Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, was in
response to a request for such an edict Friday by Solidarity
members of parliament who feared police were destroying evidence of
past misdeeds, the state PAP news agency said.
   With Solidarity in control of the government and slowly
tightening its hold on lower-level offices, there have been press
reports about bonfires of police and Communist Party records in
cities around the country.
   Interior Ministry Col. Kazimierz Piotrowski, director of the
central police archives, said Tuesday that routine destruction of
files had been carried out in recent weeks in accordance with the
law, Solidarity's Gazeta Wyborcza and the government-owned
Rzeczpospolita newspapers reported.
   Piotrowski said it is normal practice that after a certain
period of time, police materials are destroyed unless they are of
historical interest.
   A relaxation of censorship means the public will have access to
part of the archives, Piotrowski said. But the files of police
informants ``will never be disclosed to the public for obvious
reasons.''
   ``The SB (Security Service) is covering its tracks,'' said one
article in Solidarity's Gazeta Wyborcza last week.
   Piotrowski denied any abuses. ``We are in telephone contact with
chiefs of local archives and we are doing everything we can to
preserve valuable materials.''
   But he conceded that documents of the now-liquidated Security
Service department that conducted surveillance on Roman Catholic
priests considered a threat to the government were among those
being destroyed if local departments consider them without
historical value.
   Some documents concerning surveillance of the political
opposition, many of whose members now occupy the parliament and
high positions in government, also were destroyed, he said.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Decries `Crisis' in Carryout Out Death Penalties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said
Wednesday there is a crisis over delays in carrying out the death
penalty and he urged streamlining appeals procedures for death row
inmates.
   ``Delay in the review and execution of capital sentences in this
country has reached crisis proportions,'' he told a committee
studying federal court reform. ``The average delay from time of
conviction and sentence to time of execution of sentence in 1988
was six years and eight months.''
   Thornburgh endorsed proposals of a committee headed by retired
Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell calling for curtailing
appeals in capital cases. The Powell committee also would give
death row inmates a broader right to be represented by a lawyer at
taxpayer expense.
   The Powell committee rcommended that states enact laws to limit
death row inmates to two rounds of appeals in state and federal
courts. One round would challenge a verdict directly; the second
round would be based on alleged violations of the condemned
individual's rights.
   The current systems permits indefinite appeals in federal courts.
   The attorney general said it is urgent to address ``the
particularly acute problems of dilatory defense tactics and
repetitive litigation in capital cases.''
   Thornburgh also said he opposes plans to limit the power of
federal courts to deal with drug law violations and shift
enforcement to state courts.
   ``It is becoming increasingly clear that many local drug
networks have national, sometimes international, roots that demand
a coordinated federal response,'' he said.
   Thornburgh testified before the Federal Courts Study Committee,
created by Congress to come up with plans by April for dealing with
a host of problems and recommending changes.
   The committee, consisting of 15 members appointed by Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist, heard testimony in a Supreme Court
conference room from numerous judges, public officials and lawyers.
   The panel called for comment on a 140-page draft report it
released in December. It hopes to have a final report in April to
be submitted to Congress, President Bush and Rehnquist.
   Wednesday's session focused in part on the committee's criticism
of new sentencing guidelines in federal criminal cases.
   Thornburgh, among others, supported the guidelines and urged the
committee to abandon its call for giving judges more freedom to
depart from the guidelines.
   ``While the guidelines do restrict the range of appropriate
sentencing more than some judges might prefer, that is the whole
purpose'' of having them, he said.
   William W. Wilkins Jr., a federal appeals court judge who headed
the commission that devised the guidelines, said the Federal Courts
Study Committee is proposing to abandon the guidelines based on
flimsy evidence.
   ``Congress may have underestimated the need for more resources
to implement guidelines sentencing,'' Wilkins said. ``The answer to
that problem would appear to be for this committee to recommend
more judicial resources, not to call for virtual repeal'' of the
law that authorized the new procedure.
   The Supreme Court last year upheld the constitutionality of the
guidelines.
   Some judges say the new system gives prosecutors too much power
to coerce guilty pleas while stripping judges of authority to use
discretion in sentencing.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
dismissed on Wednesday as ``a good example of a rumor'' reports
that he is ready to set up Mideast negotiations.
   ``We are continuing to try to work on this problem,'' Baker
said. ``I have had some discussions in recent days with both
Israelis and Egyptians, and we are going to just continue to try
and plug away and see if we can make progress.''
   According to the reports, Baker is about to open the
negotiations, either while he is in Europe next week on his way to
Moscow or soon thereafter in Washington.
   ``That's a good example of a rumor,'' he told reporters in a
brief exchange.
   Baker has been trying to set up a three-way meeting with foreign
ministers Esmat Abdel-Meguid of Egypt and Moshe Arens of Israel for
several months.
   The secretary said that he had talked recently with Egyptians
and Israelis, but gave no indication that he has made any headway.
   The three-way session would be the first step towards holding
elections among Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza.
That, in turn, would lead to limited self-rule for the Palestinians
under a plan proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
endorsed by Baker.
   On another subject, Baker reiterated U.S. opposition to Israel's
settlement of Soviet Jewish refugees on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   He repeated the U.S. position that the settlements were ``an
obstacle to peace'' and that none of the $3 billion in annual U.S.
aid to Israel could be used for them.
   There are about 70,000 Jews living on the West Bank and in Gaza
among an estimated 1.4 million to 1.75 million Arabs.
   About 1,000 Soviet Jews arrive in Israel weekly. Only 2 percent
or less are settled on the West Bank and in Gaza.

   A new lobbying group representing oilseed
producers, processors and users called Wednesday for legislation to
guarantee farmers a choice in what they produce under federal crop
programs.
   The Oilseed Council of America said ``genuine planting
flexibility'' would help solve a decline in the competitiveness of
the U.S. oilseed industry. Oilseeds are led by soybeans, but also
include cottonseed, sunflowers and canola.
   Lowell Wilson of Primghar, Iowa, co-chairman of the council,
said current commodity programs have ``dramatically reduced acreage
planted to oilseeds by requiring producers to plant commodities
supported by target prices'' to protect crop program base acreages
used to compute benefits.
   Wilson said there is genuine planting flexibility when federal
programs are neutral in their effect on farmers' planting decisions.
   According to a study released here by the council, demand for
protein meal and oil produced when oilseeds are crushed is growing
at the rate of 4 percent a year. World trade in oilseeds and their
products, the report said, has increased twice as fast as trade in
wheat and feed grains.
   Despite the growth, the study reported that the U.S. share of
global oilseed production has dropped to 24 percent from 39 percent
six years ago, and that the U.S. share of oilseed trade has
declined to 45 percent from 75 percent.
   Floyd Anderson of Bismarck, N.D., president of the National
Sunflowerseed Association and co-chairman of the council, said
planting flexibility would let farmers take advantage of the world
demand for oilseeds by basing planting decisions on market
situations as well as natural factors.
   The formation of the group coincides with moves in Congress to
write new farm legislation to replace the 1985 law, which expires
at the end of the 1990 crop season.
   But Anderson said in a statement the council does not advocate
any specific programs and that there are a number of policy
approaches that will give producers ``genuine planting
flexibility'' and continue farm income protection.

   Maynard Jackson III, the son of Atlanta's mayor,
was fined the maximum $150 after he pleaded no contest to a
misdemeanor charge of marijuana possession.
   The action came Tuesday in Atlanta Traffic Court.
   The younger Jackson also was found guilty of a charge of
following too closely, and Judge Andrew Hairston fined him $60 on
that charge.
   The judge ordered Jackson to report back to court in 30 days to
pay the fines.
   Jackson was charged after a Jan. 9 traffic accident in Atlanta's
Buckhead neighborhood, a day before his 19th birthday. Police said
they found several marijuana cigarettes in his car.
   Mayor Maynard Jackson had said he wanted his son to receive no
special treatment by city authorities.

<HEAD>Just Another Inmate in Federal Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega is
``just another inmate'' with a window in his cell, library and
commissary privileges, and standard cafeteria food at a federal
prison, officials say.
   But he cannot come in contact with other inmates and must wear
dark green coveralls, not khaki, to distinguish him as a security
risk at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in suburban Miami.
   Noriega, facing federal drug charges, was held for three weeks
in a basement apartment in the downtown federal courthouse before
his move Sunday.
   ``He's just another inmate as far as we're concerned,'' said
spokesman Charles Davis.
   Noriega's cell measures 86 square feet, the same as the other
cells. But most other prisoners have roommates because of crowding
in the pretrial detention center.
   His cell is lighted with fluorescent bulbs and has a bed, wool
blanket, chair, writing table and a partition in front of the
commode and sink. Writing paper is provided.
   Like other inmates, Noriega will be allowed to submit a list of
potential visitors for approval by prison officials.
   He and other inmates considered security risks ``are locked in
their cells the entire day with the exception of an hour, an hour
and a half for showers and exercise,'' Davis said.
   Most prisoners eat three times a day in the prison cafeteria,
but guards pick Noriega's meals from the standard fare and deliver
them to his cell. He is allowed to buy items from the commissary or
check out library books, but only from afar.
   Noriega can shower whenever he wants, but the allotted five
hours of outdoor exercise a week will be at varying times in a
caged 20-foot-by-20-foot yard.
   A guard has been posted outside Noriega's cell, but no
surveillance camera is used in the cell, Davis said. A camera has
been installed in a nearby interview room for meetings with
attorneys or visitors.
   Defense attorney Steven Kollin wouldn't comment on the new
living conditions, but he renewed his contention that Noriega is a
prisoner of war who should be released to a third country.
   A hearing on that claim is set for Feb. 8 before U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler.

<HEAD>House Brushes Off Complaints About Voter Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Wednesday brushed aside efforts
to delay a bill to ease voter registration procedures as what
lawmakers had once billed as bipartisan harmony dissolved into
party-line bickering.
   The House, on a key procedural vote, upheld 254-166 a rule
requiring critics to tie all of their proposed amendments to the
legislation into a single bundle.
   The House will then hold just one vote on the whole package next
week when it turns to the legislation itself.
   ``And so begins the great voter registration debate of 1990,''
said Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill. ``Except that it won't be that great
a debate.''
   The so-called ``motor voter'' bill would make voter registration
automatic for any eligible American applying for a driver's
license. Other provisions would allow registration by postcard and
at various government offices.
   Critics, spurred on the Bush administration, object to the rule
giving them just one floor vote on all proposed amendments.
   Led by House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., they want
to junk restrictions on the offering of floor amendments. Such an
``open rule'' would give individual amendments a better chance of
being adopted and also slow down House action on the bill.
   ``On Monday, the minority leader swooped into town and trashed
the entire agreement,'' declared Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., a chief
sponsor of the bill.
   Swift blamed Michel for the collapse of what he called a
bipartisan agreement fashioned in the Government Operations
Committee to go forward with the bill. A number of Republicans had
backed the measure.
   ``I feel you have made a major attack on the spirit of
bipartisanship in this Congress,'' Swift said. He said the ``the
minority leader has hung out to dry his whip, his conference
chairman, his ranking member, the speaker of the House, the
majority whip and me, and he says now he hopes this will not hurt
the spirit of bipartisanship in this body.
   ``There's an old rule that says, fool me once shame on you ... I
do not propose to be fooled again,'' Swift said. He said the
episode could cut into cooperation between the parties on a major
campaign finance reform package they are attempting to fashion
jointly.
   ``Let's look before we leap and we're leaping here today,'' said
Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y. Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., urged
lawmakers to ``look under the hood of motor voter before we end up
in a ditch.''
   Michel was not present for most of Swift's remarks, but came to
the floor to answer the complaint, saying, ``I may have to share
some of the blame for missed communication on my side, but I have
not been kept as well informed (on voter registration) as I have on
campaign reform.''
   `` ... I'm sorry the gentleman should have this feeling because,
boy, there was nothing intended on my part to gut the gentleman and
turn things on their head here,'' Michel said.
   Numerous Republicans trouped to the microphones to complain
about the rule, saying they needed more maneuvering room to combat
what they described as burdensome procedures that will be imposed
on the county clerks in their districts as well as substantially
higher election costs on their states.

<HEAD>House Panel Votes Subpoenas in HUD Probe</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a decision due on a special prosecutor
for former Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., a House subcommittee
made plans Wednesday to resume hearings on the HUD scandal and
issued subpoenas naming two former officials.
   The panel subpoeaned personal bank records of Lance Wilson, a
former executive assistant to Pierce. It also voted to subpoena
James Hammernick, former director of the office of insured
multifamily housing develoment at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, to appear at a hearing Monday.
   The House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and
housing, meanwhile, set two hearings on the HUD scandal for next
week while it awaited word from Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on
whether he will ask a federal appeals court to name a special
prosecutor to investigate Pierce.
   Responding to a formal request by Democrats on the House
Judiciary Committee last fall, Thornburgh opened a preliminary
inquiry into whether a special prosecutor was warranted.
   The 60-day period for that inquiry expires Wednesday. There was
speculation Thornburgh could ask the court for more time before
deciding whether to seek the appointment of a prosecutor, called an
independent counsel under the law.
   Wilson and Pierce both invoked their Fifth Amendment rights
against self-incrimination and refused to testify before the
subcommittee in hearings last fall, as did other former top HUD
officials.
   Congressional investigators have been interested in Hammernick's
relationship with Wilson after Wilson left HUD and became a private
housing consultant and developer.
   Wilson's expense accounts filed with his employer, Paine Webber
Inc., showed that he reported spending more than $1,000
entertaining Hammernick during one month in 1987.
   Hammernick and his attorney, John McCahill, did not return
telephone calls seeking comment. Raymond Banoun, Wilson's attorney,
could not be reached immediately for comment.
   The panel also voted to subpoena bank records involving accounts
at two New York banks held by Wilson.
   The panel voted 5-0 to issue the subpoenas.
   Stuart Weisberg, subcommittee staff director, said the panel is
continuing its investigation into allegations of fraud,
mismanagement and influence-peddling at HUD during the Reagan
administration.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said last fall
that he was ready to end the panel's inquiry, which took up much of
last year.
   Weisberg said the panel was awaiting Thornburgh's decision,
however. He said the panel held open the possibility of scheduling
more hearings and taking steps to compel testimony if Thornburgh
decides against seeking a special prosecutor to investigate Pierce.
The panel could grant immunity to compel testimony from witnesses
who refuse to testify on constitutional grounds.
   Weisberg said McCahill had informed the subcommittee that his
client would invoke a House rule allowing him to prohibit cameras
and microphones from recording his subpoenaed appearance. Both
Wilson and Pierce invoked that rule when they invoked the Fifth
Amendment.

<HEAD>Author of Trade Restrictions Law Says It Should be Waived</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chief architect of U.S. trade restrictions
against the Soviet Union and its allies said Wednesday they should
be lifted immediately but not repealed outright.
   ``The rest of America is not yet prepared to consider anything
more for the Soviet Union than a waiver'' despite the crumbling of
the Iron Curtain and the massive changes taking place behind it,
former Rep. Charles A. Vanik, D-Ohio, told the House Ways and Means
Committee.
   Then chairman of the panel's trade subcommittee, Vanik and the
late Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., in 1974 co-authoried the
Jackson-Vanik Amendment barriers imposing high tariffs on imports
from the Soviet Union and its allies and denying them export
credits to buy U.S. goods.
   Vanik said repealing the law entirely, as U.S. business leaders
have urged, is unlikely because 20 percent of the public and
Congress remain ``opposed to any relationship with the Soviet Union
on the unrealistic basis that evil empires never change.''
   However, he disagreed with President Bush's insistence that
Moscow first put into law its recently adopted free emigration
policies before granting the waivers conditionally promised to
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Malta summit in
December.
   ``I judge the Soviet Union by the deed more than the statute,''
Vanik said of recent Soviet emigration policies. ``The process
appears to be a well-established, non-reversible course.''
   He said U.S. slowness in normalizing trade relations with Moscow
and the newly reincarnated governments of Eastern Europe risks
losing those fledgling free markets to other Western powers such as
Japan and West Germany.
   ``No other nation in the world stands to lose so much if it
continues to stand still,'' he said.
   House Democrats expressed frustration that the adminsitration
has not moved faster to lower the barriers to expanded trade with
the Soviets and other East Europeans.
   ``We're worried, we don't see any actual planning for this,''
said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla. ``We don't spot the administration
doing a lot.''
   The Jackson-Vanik law was enacted largely to stop former
President Nixon's efforts to conclude a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement
in the early 1970s and to pressure Moscow to lift restrictions on
the emigration of Soviet Jews and other dissidents.
   Since 1986, Soviet emigration has climbed from just under 2,000
to approximately 195,000 last year.
   Vanik said waiving the restrictions in his law ``is perhaps the
best available official signal we have in our system ... to
acknowledge what President Gorbachev has done (and) to acknowledge
that we like what is going on.''

   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos discussed
the solar system with fourth graders at a suburban Roman Catholic
school Wednesday, hours before the president challenged American
students to excel in math and science.
   ``Who can name the planets in the solar system?'' Cavazos asked
the nearly two dozen youngsters at St. Camillus, an elementary
school in Silver Spring, Md.
   ``We learned a sentence to help us know them,'' 9-year-old John
Oduroe informed him. ``It goes, `My Very Energetic Mother Just
Served Us Nine Pancakes.'''
   The boy then began to tick off the names of the planets as other
classmates joined in _ Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto _ showing they could be among the
nation's better students.
   The visit by Cavazos, a former teacher who had served as
president of Texas Tech University before joining the Reagan
administration, underscored a message of President Bush in his
State of the Union address _ American students must be first in the
world by the year 2000 in science and math.
   Cavazos and other education officials have repeatedly that
studies show:
   _Just 40 percent of American 13-year-old students could solve a
two-step problem in math, compared with 72 percent of the South
Korean students.
   _Only 42 percent of 13-year-old U.S. students could successfully
analyze experiments, compared with 72 percent of the South Korean
students.
   _Singapore ranks first in 12th grade biology, while America is
dead last among 13 countries.
   _Fewer than 1 percent of U.S. students take physics and
chemistry, while up to 25 percent of 18-year-olds in Canada and
Norway take the two subjects for two years each.
   _Japan and Korea tie for first in general science for
10-year-olds, while America ranks eighth.
   However, officials of the National Catholic Educational
Association are quick to show that Catholic math students score 3.6
percent to 5.46 percent better than public school students and
Catholic school science scores are higher that public schools by
4.39 percent in the third grade, 6.36 percent in the seventh grade
and 3.76 percent in the 11th grade.
   ``The solution of American problems will not be solved by one
educational system alone, but every system working together,''
Cavazos told an audience that included the 278 St. Camillus
students, some of their parents and Catholic education officials.
   The selection of St. Camillus served a variety of purposes
during celebration of ``National Appreciation Day for Catholic
Schools.'' Besides having high-achieving youngsters, Principal
Suzette Chagnon estimates her students come from families
originating in at least 25 countries.
   The Bush administration has been bombarded with suggested ways
to improve academic achievement, especially among members of
minority groups, since President Bush called the nation's governors
to an education ``summit conference'' last year. The ideas are to
be distilled into national goals by late February.
   American students attend school about 180 days per year, while
Europeans typically attend 220 days, the Japanese 240 days and
South Koreans 250 days per year, Senate Democratic leader George
Mitchell has pointed out.
   Scott Thomson, executive director of the National Association of
Secondary School Principals, says that in Germany, radio and
television programs on math and science supplement school work. In
South Korea, 71 percent of the 13-year-old students watch science
programs compared with only 37 percent in America.
   ``At about that age, many American students fail to keep an
active interest in science,'' said Thomson. ``Schools need to work
harder to make science attractive, but other institutions in
society must support this effort.''
   Thomson added that in a 1987 survey of 3,000 high school
sophomores who were asked whether, ``my parents think science is a
very important subject,'' 57 percent said ``no.''

<HEAD>Trucking Group Wants to Ban Alcohol Sale at Stops</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Trucking Association said
Wednesday that it will campaign to ban the sale of alcohol at truck
stops across the country.
   Thomas J. Donahue, president of the trade group, said the step,
which would require action by the states or cooperation by truck
stops, is part of an industry effort to identify and fire truckers
who drink or use drugs while driving.
   But Donahue acknowleged at a news conference that the industry
is trying to avoid the imposition of federal regulations mandating
the use of expensive Breathalyzers to detect alcohol consumption.
   In comments filed Wednesday with the Department of
Transportation, the association said that compelling all trucking
companies to buy individual Breathalyzers to test drivers could
cost from $510 million to $850 million.
   Attaching Breathalyzers to the ignition on each truck to prevent
use of the vehicle if alcohol consumption was detected could cost
``close to $2 billion,'' the association said.
   Donahue said alcohol and drug testing should be conducted during
state-mandated roadside checks.
   ``Blowing in an apparatus (installed in the truck) to see if you
can drive doesn't make sense,'' he said.
   ``Cost is a huge factor,'' Donahue said, adding that alcohol and
drug testing conducted solely by trucking companies would also
prove to be a considerable administrative burden.
   ``We want the roads safe. That's good business, good politics
for us. But we don't want it stupid.
   ``The American people have the right to believe that the driver
of an 80,000 pound vehicle is sober,'' Donahue said, adding that
the 5 million truckers already are forbidden to drink or use drugs
on the job or to have alcohol in their trucks.
   ``It doesn't make sense to sell it to them,'' he said about
sales at truck stops. ``It's an unnecessary temptation to the
drivers.''
   Donahue said the association will seek the support of the
National Association of Truck Stop Operators at its annual
convention in Las Vegas on Thursday.
   He said he believes that alcohol and drug abuse is a relatively
small problem in the trucking industry, far less than for drivers
as a whole. But he said there was room for improvement and that the
industry should show no tolerance for those who break the rules.

   Police arrested three people Wednesday after
demonstrators protesting the plight of the homeless threw what they
said was blood on the U.S. Capitol hours before the president's
State of the Union address.
   The demonstrators were identified as members of the Community
for Creative Non-Violence, an organization that runs a 1,400-bed
shelter for the homeless near the Capitol.
   ``The state of the union as we view it is very different than
the way President Bush sees it,'' said Mitch Snyder, a leader of
the organization. ``We felt compelled to communicate that view of
the state of the union.''
   Red liquid was splattered on outdoor pillars and steps on both
the Senate and House sides of the building.
   The acts were committed simultaneously about noon while Congress
was in session.
   A spokesman for the Capitol police, Dan Nichols, said two women
and a man were arrested.
   They were identified as Elizabeth Mastropierro, 22, and Rachel
Frankel, 30, both of Washington. Each was charged with injuring
government property, a federal felony carrying a maximum penalty of
a $10,000 fine and 10 years in prison, and committing an act of
physical violence on U.S. Capitol grounds, a federal misdemeanor
that carries a maximum penalty of a $50 fine and six months in jail.
   Nichols said that when police tried to cordon off the area so
that it could be cleaned, a man identified as Charles O'Lare, 22,
of Washington refused to leave and was charged with unlawful entry,
a District of Columbia misdemeanor carrying a maximum sentence of a
$500 fine and six months in jail.
   While workmen scrubbed the building clean, Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., took the floor of the House to express his outrage over the
vandalism.
   He likened the incident to desecration of the American flag and
said Congress should act to protect its symbols.
   ``Some people threw what appears to be blood on the outside of
the U.S. Capitol,'' he said. ``All of us ought to be indignant.''

   Prices farmers get for raw products rose 2.7
percent from December to January, leaving the monthly average also
2.7 percent above the year-ago level, the Agriculture Department
said Wednesday.
   Higher prices for tomatoes, lettuce and broilers mostly were
responsible for the increase from December, the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary report.
   ``Tomato prices more than doubled due to short supplies brought
on by the freeze in Florida in December,'' the report said.
``Lettuce prices were nearly double for the same reason.''
   Commercial vegetables as a group were up 68 percent from
December and 32 percent from a year ago.
   Lower prices were reported for soybeans, strawberries and
oranges.
   Milk prices at the farm, which had risen to record levels late
last year, were unchanged in January. Department dairy economists
have forecast that milk prices would level off this year.
   Prices paid by farmers to meet expenses, meanwhile, were up 1.1
percent from October, the previous reading, and averaged 2.9
percent above a year ago, the report said. The ``prices paid''
index is revised every three months.
   The report said prices for feeder cattle and calves, feeder
pigs, diesel fuel and LP gas were up from October.
   Department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990
may be in the range of $52 billion to $57 billion, compared with
about $53 billion in 1989.
   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   In another method taking into account changes in inventories,
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that
1990 net farm income may be in the range of $44 billion to $49
billion, compared with $48 billion last year.
   Consumer food prices are estimated by department economists to
have risen about 5.7 percent this year, the sharpest rise since
1981. They project food prices may rise 3 percent to 5 percent in
1990.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the January price index for
livestock and poultry was unchanged from December but averaged 7.6
percent more than a year ago.
   Crop prices, overall, rose 6.3 percent from December but
averaged 4.3 percent below a year ago. The sharp rise in the price
of commercial vegetables caused most of the increase from December,
the report said.
   The fruit index dropped 9.3 percent from December and was 9.8
percent below a year earlier.
   ``All fruit prices used in the index were down from last month
except for apples and lemons which were up slightly,'' the report
said. ``Oranges and strawberries had the largest downward influence
on the index.''
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $71.60 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $71 in December and $70.60 in January 1989.
Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $46.90 per 100 pounds, compared with $48.20 in
December and $40.90 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.26 a bushel, edged down from $2.27 in December and
was down from $2.60 a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.83 per bushel, compared with $3.80 in December and
$4.02 a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.11 per 100 pounds, up from $6.95 in December
and $6.58 in January 1989.
   _Soybeans were $5.52 per bushel, down from $5.64 in December and
far below the year-earlier mark of $7.69 per bushel.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 60.2 cents per pound, down from
61.4 cents in December but above the average of 54.7 cents a year
earlier.
   _Eggs were 83.8 cents per dozen, up from 82.8 cents in December
and 63.9 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $16.10 per 100 pounds, unchanged from December but
above the year-earlier average of $13.40.
   _Broilers were 30.7 cents per pound, live weight, up from 28.6
cents in December but down from the 35.3 cents of a year earlier.

   Republican National Committee chairman Lee
Atwater, saying ``I make no bones about'' supporting Oliver L.
North, is allowing his name to be used in connection with an
upcoming fund-raising affair for the convicted Iran-Contra figure.
   Atwater is one of 25 people _ including conservative fund-raiser
Richard Viguerie and Equal Rights Amendment foe Phyllis Schlafly _
on the host committee for the March 3 ``Salute to Oliver North.''
   The event is organized by the Legal Affairs Council of
Chantilly, Va.
   North was convicted last May of three felonies in the
Iran-Contra affair. Arguments in his appeal will be heard Tuesday
in federal appeals court in Washington.
   ``I don't mind at all being counted among his supporters; I make
no bones about it,'' said Atwater.
   Atwater, who won't be able to attend because of ``a long-time
speaking engagement'' that day in Puerto Rico, said he hasn't
donated money to the event and ``hadn't thought about'' doing so.
   The RNC chairman said that he ``was frankly not sure what my
name would be used for'' when he was approached recently by
organizers of the event ``but I didn't hesitate and I don't
hesitate now.''
   North is ``a good man ... a well-meaning man ... a true
patriot,'' who ``may have made some mistakes,'' said Atwater,
adding, ``I don't know anybody who hasn't.''
   A separate congressional host committee for the event lists 40
representatives and 11 senators, including Sens. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. Forty-one conservative groups are
co-sponsoring the event.
   Tickets for the reception and dinner sell for $150 apiece. The
Legal Affairs Council, which staged a ``salute'' barbecue for North
last September, has raised and contributed $315,000 to the former
National Security Council aide, the organization said in a Jan. 16
mailing addressed to ``Friends of Oliver North.''

<HEAD>U.S. Magazine Delayed in Customs Because of Disputed Kashmir Map</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOMBAY, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Distribution of this week's edition of
Newsweek magazine has been delayed because a map depicts large
parts of the Jammu-Kashmir region as Pakistani territory, a senior
customs official said Wednesday.
   India and Pakistan both claim Jammu-Kashmir. The 43-year-old
dispute heated up again when India launched a crackdown Jan. 20
against Kashmiri Moslems who want to secede from India.
   The customs official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the 10,000 copies of Newsweek that arrived at Bombay airport early
Wednesday have not been impounded. But he said a process often used
to speed up clearance for weekly magazines is not being used to
clear the Newsweek issue.
   Normally, consignments must be cleared against a bill of entry,
a procedure that can take up to two days. In cases considered
urgent, the consignments are cleared faster with an understanding
that bill of entry formalities will be completed later.
   ``This is a facility extended in rare cases, not as a matter of
right but for convenience,'' the customs official said.
   In previous disputes over maps in foreign publications, India
has allowed the books or magazines in question to enter the country
after stamping them with notations that the borders are ``neither
correct nor authenticated.''
   There was no indication whether this would happen to the
Newsweek map.
   Newsweek is distributed in India by Living Media India Ltd. A
company spokesman declined comment on the customs action.

Proposals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The major powers' new blueprint for peace in
Cambodia through U.N.-supervised disarmament and preparation for
free elections won initial backing in Congress Wednesday.
   Two House subcommittees endorsed a resolution strongly
supporting the proposal for interim U.N. supervision and
administration after chairmen of both panels described it as the
best hope for ending Cambodia's bloodshed and blocking the return
of the communist Khmer Rouge.
   The legislation was sent with unanimous voice-vote endorsements
to the full Foreign Affairs committee on what congressional aides
called a ``fast track'' aimed at getting approval of both houses of
Congress before Secretary of State James Baker's February meeting
in Moscow with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Sheverdnadze.
   The resolution would have Congress reject major rival proposals
that deadlocked last summer's international conference on Cambodia,
allowing the Southeast Asian country to slide into revived civil
war.
   One would have given Cambodia a four-faction interim government
led by U.S.-backed Prince Norodom Sihanouk and including the Khmer
Rouge, blamed for more than 1 million Cambodian deaths during their
1975-78 rule. The other would have allowed Premier Hun Sen's
Vietnam-installed government in Phonm Penh to continue ruling until
the elections.
   Sihanouk's four-party proposal ``is not an acceptable basis for
negotiations because it would legitimize the Khmer Rouge,'' and
allow it to subvert the interim government, said the resolution. It
added that letting Hun Sen's regime to stay in power ``would
legitimize an illegitimate government'' and undermine confidence in
the elections.
   ``Anything less than a strong international presence could pave
the way for a return to power of the genocidal Pol Pot,'' leader of
the Khmer Rouge, said the Human Rights subcommittee Chairman,
Democrat Gus Yatron.
   The resolution might produce ``some positive action'' by
Sihanouk to end his controversial alliance with the Khmer Rouge, or
``it could maybe mean the end'' for him, Yatron said in answer to a
reporter.
   Asian-Pacific subcommittee Chairman Stephen Solarz was chief
sponsor of the resolution backing the U.N. formula framed by the
five permanent Security members meeting in Paris two weeks ago
along lines proposed by Australia. The five permament members are
the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.

<HEAD>Vietnam Objector Cause of Band's Rift with American Legion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELKINS, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Legion post is dropping its
sponsorship of a bagpipe band after 42 years because a band member
was a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War.
   Charlie McElwain, 43, a Seventh Day Baptist, requested medical
or non-combat duties instead of military service when he was
drafted. His draft board instead asked him to work two years at
Memorial General Hospital in Elkins.
   American Legion Post 29 learned last year that McElwain was a
conscientious objector and in August asked him to withdraw from the
27-member West Virginia Highlander Bagpipe Band.
   ``The state and national constitutions of the American Legion
say that no person can be associated with the American Legion who
has not offered himself to the military in an unqualified state,''
said Post 29 band committee chairman Robert Magos.
   ``If you go in there and say, `I won't do this and I won't do
that and I won't fight and I won't carry a gun,' then you do not
qualify under the Constitution of the American Legion,'' Magos said.
   ``I believe it's discrimination against my religion and my
freedoms as an American,'' said McElwain, who said his ancestors
came to this country in 1745.
   The band marches in parades and has played at everything from
funerals and weddings to the Apple Blossom Festival in Virginia.
   Last month, the post passed a set of rules the band would have
to live by for continued support, including one that all band
members be approved by Legion members.
   Band members refused and Post 29 dropped its sponsorship,
including the band's right to hold a weekly bingo game at the
Legion hall under the Legion post's state bingo license.
   Band pipe major Tom McLaughlin said the bingo game, which Post
29 has taken over, raised about $15,000 a year.
   McElwain said the community stands behind him in the dispute.
   ``Everybody I've talked to has supported me. One fellow I work
with was a full colonel in one of the services. He said he
supported me 100 percent,'' McElwain said.
   Magos said the Legion post had to take over the band's Saturday
night bingo fund-raiser in October to ensure that it was run
according to state law.
   ``People were getting paid to run the bingo games, which is
outside the state law,'' Magos said. ``We repeatedly told the band
not to do it any more, to no avail, and we had to take some
action.''
   But McLaughlin said post officials were just looking for an
excuse to take over the game.
   ``We never broke the law. They just wanted the money from the
bingo game,'' McLaughlin said.
   ``I don't think Charlie's conscientious objector status has a
thing to do with what they're doing,'' he said. ``I think that was
just a smoke screen to get at the money.
   McLaughlin said inquiries have been made about other groups
sponsoring the band, but nothing has been signed. ``We're trying to
set ourselves up just to keep ourselves going, and anything beyond
that we give that back to charity,'' he said.
   ``I think at the beginning, my status was a way of getting at
the money, but I think they eventually decided they needed to get
me, too,'' McElwain said.
   Despite the dispute, the American Legion has continued to let
the band use its hall for practice.

<HEAD>Three Largest Parties Agree on Coalition Cabinet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three largest political parties
agreed Wednesday, in an apparent effort at national unity, that the
next president should have a coalition Cabinet.
   The agreement among the Liberal, Conservative and Patriotic
Union parties will apply to the person who is elected May 27 and
takes office Aug. 7.
   President Virgilio Barco, a Liberal, has earned international
praise for his war on drug traffickers, but squabbling among the
three parties has cost him support at home.
   Colombia's constitution limits a president to one term of four
years.
   Former President Misael Pastrana, head of the Conservative
Party, proposed the coalition Cabinet earlier this month.
   Former President Julio Cesar Turbay of the Liberals and Diego
Montana Cuellar, leader of the Patriotic Union, sent open letters
of agreement Wednesday.
   Nothing has been said about how many of the 13 Cabinet posts
each party would get.
   In 1958, in an effort to end a civil war that had taken more
than 200,000 lives, the Conservatives and Liberals agreed to
alternate in the presidency for 16 years.
   After the 1976 presidential election, the two parties continued
with another part of the agreement that assured both of Cabinet
representation. Barco ended that last year when he reorganized the
Cabinet and gave all the ministries to Liberals.
   The Patriotic Union is a Marxist coalition organized five years
ago by leftist guerrillas who accepted pardons from the government
of President Belisario Betancur.
   When he proposed the coalition Cabinet, Pastrana also suggested
a national plebiscite on constitutional reforms. Political leaders
have suggested reform of Colombia's court system and allowing the
president more power in emergencies like the drug war.
   There also have been proposals that presidents be allowed more
than one term.
   Montana Cuellar said in his letter to Pastrana that he supported
a plebiscite, but Turbay of the Liberals said he doubted agreement
on what should be included could be reached before the May 27
election.
   In London, Amnesty International expressed concern Wednesday
about the increasing number of people missing in Colombia,
including 42 farm workers reported kidnapped Jan. 14.
   It said the workers were seized by 40 armed men, some wearing
military uniforms, at Pueblo Bello in northwestern Colombia. The
village is in the Uraba banana plantation, scene of heavy fighting
the past few months between government forces and leftist
guerrillas.
   Amnesty said the workers were tied up and loaded into two
trucks, which drove away. Witnesses said the assailants set fire to
several houses and other buildings before leaving, the statement
added.
   Gov. Herran de Montoya of Uraba said the kidnappers apparently
were guerrillas, but Colombian radio networks that sent reporters
to the town said they appeared to be members of a right-wing death
squad. There has been no word on the fate of the kidnapped people.
   Death squads have killed more than 1,000 people the past four
years. A government investigation determined there were more than
100 such squads in Colombia and most were run by drug traffickers.

<HEAD>Bush's New Budget Already Under Congressional Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's 1991 budget came under
renewed congressional attack on Wednesday with critics brandishing
figures that called into question $37 billion of the deficit
reduction being claimed by the administration.
   The analysis, done by the bipartisan Congressional Budget
Office, said that the deficit for next year, without policy
changes, would total $138 billion, not the $101 billion claimed by
the administration.
   CBO Director Robert D. Reischauer said that $26 billion of the
higher deficit estimate was accounted for by using a less
optimistic forecast on economic growth and interest rates. The
other $11 billion was attributed to higher projections on
government spending in such areas as the savings and loan bailout
and health care.
   The growth forecast is critical to the government's revenue
assumptions while the interest rate forecast affects estimates of
how much the government will have to spend to finance the $2.8
trillion national debt.
   By using higher growth and lower interest rate assumptions than
the CBO and most private economists, the administration was able to
come up with a starting deficit of $101 billion next year, compared
to the CBO's $138 billion figure.
   That means that the administration was only required to produce
$37 billion in savings to meet the legal requirement of proposing a
budget with a $64 billion deficit in the 1991 budget year, which
starts next October.
   By using the CBO's assumptions, which track the consensus
forecast of private economists, the administration would have had
to double the amount of spending cuts or tax increases needed to
meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit target.
   House Budget Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said that he could
not remember such a wide disparity between the administration's
economic assumptions and the CBO.
   ``We are facing a terrible credibility problem with the American
people on the base of these estimates,'' Panetta said.
   Congress is free to adopt either the CBO estimate or the
assumptions in the Bush budget in drawing up its own spending plan,
but the administration's economic assumptions are required to be
used in determining whether across-the-board spending cuts will be
triggered if the deficit is not reduced enough.
   Both Budget Director Richard Darman and Michael Boskin, chairman
of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, were sharply
questioned about the economic assumptions during separate
appearances on Thursday.
   Boskin, appearing before the House Budget Committee, said that
the economy was going through a sluggish period at present, with
growth slumping to an anemic rate of just 0.5 percent in the final
three months of 1990, but he predicted a rebound would occur in
coming months.
   He did not rule out, however, the possibility that growth as
measured by the gross national product, might dip below 1 percent
in the current January-March quarter.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman law, two consecutive quarters of growth
below 1 percent would require lawmakers to vote on suspending the
deficit reduction targets for 1991.
   Boskin said Congress should not suspend the deficit targets,
especially if there were signals that growth was beginning to
rebound, because it could send a signal that the government's
deficit-fighting resolve was weakening.
   ``A suspension of Gramm-Rudman could have very unfavorable
impacts on financial markets and cause interest rates to rise,'' he
said.
   Darman, testifying before the Senate Budget Committee, was
hammered by Democrats, who described the budget as unrealistic in
its economic assumptions and in its call for $292 billion for the
military.
   ``This is a menu of Cold War leftovers and warmed-over Reagan,''
said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the committee.
   ``I'm not at all sure we are going to get a budget (agreement)
unless the rhetoric turns down,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New
Mexico, senior Republican on the panel.
   Darman denied the budget ignores the movement toward democracy
in Eastern Europe, which many lawmakers view as requiring less
military spending. ``The reality is that this is a budget which
proposes a 2.6 percent real cut (in military spending) in the first
year and a 2 percent real cut every year thereafter,'' he said.
   ``I do not regard this as a serious budget,'' said Sen. Bennett
Johnston, D-La. He asked Darman: ``When do we get down to the
serious business of getting together with the White House'' and
negotiating a compromise?
   ``We'd be prepared to start at 10 o'clock tonight after the
president's speech,'' Darman replied, referring to Bush's State of
the Union address.

   A ringed seal not usually found in the

colder waters off Massachusetts.
   The 36-pound, 9-month-old seal that washed ashore last week in
Sandy Hook was flown by Robert Kindle, a Wildwood automobile dealer
who donated his six-passenger plane, said Sheila Dean, co-director
of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center here.
   Center director Robert Schoelkopf also went on the flight, Ms.
Dean said.
   The seal was to be flown to Provincetown, Mass., where it will
be placed in the water, Ms. Dean said.
   The seal gained 5{ pounds in its stay at the stranding center,
feeding on minnows and shrimp.
   Center officials bleached a number on the seal's back in case it
washes ashore again, Ms. Dean said. The seal is too small to carry
a radio tag to monitor its whereabouts, Ms. Dean said.

   If Michael Leonard Jackson had waited a
few minutes more he could have walked out of court a free man. But
he didn't wait, and he became a wanted man.
   Jackson, 26, of Pensacola left the Escambia County Judicial
Center on Jan. 24 just before jurors found him innocent of burglary
and theft.
   Circuit Judge Nickolas Geeker ordered his arrest for failure to
appear in court. Formal charges were filed Tuesday; Jackson
remained at-large Wednesday, authorities said.
   Gary Suttles, Jackson's lawyer, said he has talked to his client
since he left the courtroom and that he knows he was acquitted. He
refused to discuss why Jackson, who was free on bond during the
trial, left.
   Suttles and Jackson had returned to the courtroom after being
told the jurors would announce their verdict momentarily. The
lawyer said that before the judge and jury filed into the courtroom
Jackson asked if he could go to a snack bar in the building to get
his girlfriend.
   ``When he went downstairs, he did not return,'' Suttles said.
   Geeker noted the defendant's absence and read the jury's verdict.

   The Wisconsin Assembly approved a parental
consent bill for minors obtaining abortions Wednesday, a day after
it defeated an attempt to repeal a dormant law that penalizes
doctors who perform abortions.
   Anti-abortion forces said the two votes were overwhelming
victories for their national movement, but pro-choice leaders,
while conceding defeat, predicted the actions would help them
unseat lawmakers in the fall elections.
   ``We will remember in November,'' Denise Matyka, a pro-choice
leader and past president of Wisconsin National Organization for
Women, told a rally outside the Capitol hours after the consent
bill was approved. ``We will show the politicians that a vote
against reproductive choice is a vote against the will of the
people.''
   The consent bill, which requires girls under 18 to get the
permission of at least one parent or a judge before having an
abortion, now advances to the Senate where lawmakers warned it
likely would be stalled in committee.
   ``We will not move too hastily on this matter,'' Senate
President Fred Risser said Wednesday, noting the nine-week
legislative session ends March 23.
   Susan Armacost, legislative director of Wisconsin Right to Life
Inc., said the Assembly vote to delay the repeal bill and pass the
consent measure was ``obviously a bitter defeat for pro-abortion
forces.''
   She said her group would press for Senate action on the parental
consent measure. ``This bill is too important to be delayed. It
already has been delayed too long.''
   But state Rep. Robert Welch, an anti-abortion leader in the
Assembly, said he wasn't optimistic about winning Senate approval
this session.
   Assembly Speaker Thomas A. Loftus criticized the consent bill.
   ``It fails in the areas of reality, compassion and common
sense,'' Loftus told the Assembly before the final vote. ``It's
designed to get this state to the extreme side of the anti-abortion
movement.''
   Loftus said a provision in the bill defines abortion for minors
differently than it is defined in other statutes.
   Abortion is the use of any instrument, medicine, drug or any
other substance or device with intent to terminate the pregnancy of
a minor, the bill said.
   ``This bill is designed to outlaw contraceptives,'' Loftus said,
adding that the provision would include experimental drugs such as
a French pill to induce abortion and the ``morning-after'' pill.
   The Assembly voted 57-39 Tuesday against repealing a dormant
state law that provides criminal penalties for performing
abortions. The law was rendered unenforceable by the U.S. Supreme
Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.
   Abortion opponents said they want to keep the law on the books
in hope the Roe vs. Wade decision will someday be overturned.
   Welch said the votes on the two bills were important because
they marked the first time a state legislature acted on the
abortion issue since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a Missouri
case last summer that states could have greater latitude in
regulating abortions.
   ``This sends a clear signal nationally because it marked such a
resounding victory,'' Welch said. ``I think this was a shot heard
round the world.''
   But state Rep. David Clarenbach hailed the repeal vote despite
the defeat, saying a year ago the same bill would have received far
fewer votes in favor.
   ``The trend is running against abortion opponents,'' said
Clarenbach, the Assembly's president pro tem. ``The Legislature is
in the process of becoming pro-choice.''

   The major opposition party warned
Wednesday that Romania will wind up with a new communist
dictatorship unless elections set for May are delayed four months
to give people time to absorb all the changes.
   The reaction from the National Peasants Party was wary, and from
some other opponents downright hostile to Tuesday's announcement by
the revolutionary government that it planned to keep on governing
while competing in elections.
   The self-appointed National Salvation Front offered to share
power and establish a separate political wing to represent it in
Romania's first free elections since World War II.
   ``This is illegal, ''said Liberal Party organizer Nicolae
Enescu. ``If it takes part in the elections and represents the
interests of the state, it seems like a dictatorship again.''
   Valentin Gabrielescu, chief spokesman for the Peasants Party,
said the elections should be postponed from May 20 until September
``in order to try to educate the Romanian people about the
electoral process.''
   ``After half a century of dictatorial rule, these people are
completely confused. It will take time to educate them,'' he added.
   Growing political anxiety has replaced the euphoria that
followed the ouster of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu,
overthrown in a popular uprising last month and executed Dec. 25
with his politically powerful wife, Elena.
   The tensions were highlighted by pro- and anti-government
demonstrations this week, sychronized attacks on 27 Peasants Party
headquarters nationwide on Monday, and political arguments that
continue to draw crowds on Bucharest's freezing street corners.
   The opposition lays much of the blame on the National Salvation
Front, ruling by decree since it took power in the chaos that
followed the revolution ending Ceausescu's 24-year rule.
   Enemies of the Front claim its 11-member ruling council has
manipulated the electorate through its control of the news media
and all other organs of the state, seeking an edge in advance of
the May elections.
   ``Maybe in the fall, we'll be able to win the election.
Otherwise, we will have a new communist government and (interim
President Ion) Iliescu will be one of the `most beloved sons of the
country,'' Gabrielescu said, derisively using the term the
prerevolutionary press frequently bestowed on Ceausescu.
   ``The way is very difficult because we have 40 years of
political vacuum,'' concurred Peasants Party President Corneliu
Coposu, a 74-year-old church canon lawyer who was imprisoned from
1946-74 by successive Communist leaders.
   In a response to criticism, the Front disclosed Tuesday it had
split in two, creating a Provisional National Council to run
Romania until the elections in tandem with other political parties,
and converting the Front into a political organization to field
candidates.
   ``The Front will participate in the vote,'' senior Front
official Silviu Brucan said in an interview in Wednesday's Romania
Libera daily, reiterating his organization's intention to run the
elections.
   It was the Front's reversal of its pledge not to run in
elections, and questions about whether it could fairly administer
an election in which it was also competing, that drew heavy fire,
including condemnation from potential Western aid donors.
   Ana Blandiana, a leading poet and former dissident, resigned
from the Front, citing ``shattered illusions,'' Romania Libera
said. She was the fourth leading Front member to step down.
   While the National Peasants Party branded as ``impudent'' the
Front's transformation into both a political party and a
government, it also called it a gain for the opposition.
   ``Our proposal was agreed to in principle, so the first point is
a win,'' said Gabrielescu.
   He said the next major battle for the opposition will be to win
two-thirds of the seats in the projected 100-seat Provisional
National Council.
   ``The most important thing is simply the presence of parties in
the council,'' agreed Sergiu Cunescu, president of the Social
Democratic Party.
   He expressed optimism that splitting up of the Front would ease
political tensions.
   The Peasants Party, the Social Democrats and the Liberals _ the
three major opposition groups _ say most of the 30 or so opposition
parties that have sprung up since the revolution are fakes, backed
by the Front to tout its party line under other names.
   With 260,000 members, the Peasants Party is the largest
opposition organization.
   The United States took aim at the National Salvation Front on
Tuesday.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in
Washington, ``We are deeply troubled by what appears to be active
intimidation of legitimate organizations which are seeking a
legitimate, independent role in Romania's new political order.''

   Silent screen star Helen Jerome Eddy,
known for her portrayals of high-class heroines in such movies as
the 1916 version of ``Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,'' has died of
heart failure. She was 92.
   Miss Eddy died Saturday at the Episcopal Home, spokeswoman Nancy
Potthast said Wednesday. There was no funeral.
   Raised in Los Angeles, Miss Eddy was attracted to films by the
old Philadelphia-based studios of Siegmund Lubin, which had just
opened a Los Angeles lot in her neighborhood.
   Her first film in 1915 was ``The Red Virgin.'' She moved from
there to Paramount Studios and began to portray the roles for which
she became known.
   In addition to ``Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm,'' those roles
included ``The March Hare'' in 1921, ``The Dark Angel'' in 1925,
``Camille'' in 1927 and ``The Divine Lady'' in 1927.
   Her last movie, a talkie, was ``Strike Up the Band'' in 1940, in
which she played Mrs. Brewster, the mother of one of Mickey
Rooney's friends.
   Miss Eddy never married and leaves no known survivors.

   Rice farmers will have to idle only 20 percent
of their acreage to qualify for this year's price support program
instead of the 22.5 percent announced on Jan. 3, Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Wednesday.
   Yeutter said the lower set-aside, which means farmers can plant
more for the 1990 harvest, was decided after reviewing recent
projected rice supply-and-demand figures.
   The figures showed the U.S. rice inventory will be drawn down to
19 million hundredweight by Aug. 1, the lowest reserve at the start
of a new rice marketing year since the 1980 crop. The inventory
last Aug. 1 was 26.7 million hundredweight.

<HEAD>Chief Congressional Tax Writer Sees No Need for Tax System Changes</HEAD>
<NOTE>For Release 8 p.m. EST</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, the senior tax writer
in Congress, said Wednesday he remains to be convinced that the
federal tax system is in need of any major change.
   Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat who chairs the House Ways and
Means Committee, cited a cut in the capital-gains tax _ a major
goal of President Bush _ as a prime example of something he feels
is not needed.
   In a speech to the Tax Council, a business group, Rostenkowski
compared advocates of a lower capital-gains tax to ``fuzzy-minded
peace advocates who think that we could somehow wish the creation
of a stable world that would allow us all to disarm.''
   ``Both have a deep faith that belies historic experience,'' he
said. ``Both have a fervent belief that the wish is the father of
the deed. And, unfortunately, both are dead wrong.''
   Capital gains are profits from the sale of stock and other
investments. Since a lower tax rate for capital gains was repealed
in 1986, Rostenkowski noted, the value of stocks on the New York
Stock Exchange has risen 40 percent.
   ``I am not claiming that our tax laws have boosted the market,''
Rostenkowski said. ``To the contrary, I am arguing that the market
has a dynamic of its own that is generally independent of our tax
laws.''
   The chairman also expressed his distaste for special tax breaks
offered as incentives to encourage saving. ``I've become convinced
... that most tax incentives simply don't work,'' he said. ``And
the few that do work, don't work very well.''
   Bush is asking Congress to create a new savings plan that would
allow a couple with income of $120,000 or less to avoid tax on
interest earned on special accounts held at least seven years.
   Other savings plans built around tax breaks have done little to
boost the nation's low rate of personal saving, Rostenkowski said.
   Rostenkowski said he is open to suggestions for modernizing the
tax law. ``But I am not convinced that our tax system is
fundamentally broken,'' he said. ``Thus I have little sympathy with
those who keep coming up with plans to fix it.''

   Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi urged
American Jewish leaders Wednesday to use their influence in
Congress to increase U.S. aid for his country.
   Moi, speaking to representatives of 50 major Jewish
organizations, also said Jewish leaders should influence the U.S.
government to provide funding to projects for developing semi-arid
areas in Kenya with expertise from Israel.
   ``I know your influence is tremendous,'' Moi said.
   Kenya last year resumed diplomatic relations with Israel, which
had been severed in 1973 under heavy pressure from the Arab world.
   Moi is in Washington on a private visit to attend Thursday's
National Prayer Breakfast. President Bush will be the keynote
speaker at the interdenominational gathering, which has been held
each year since World War II and is attended by religious and
political leaders.
   Moi said relations between his country and the United States had
improved greatly under the Bush administration, but that Kenya
still needs help in improving contacts with Congress. U.S. aid to
Kenya has declined in recent years.
   Some members of Congress have sharply criticized Kenya for its
human-rights record, but Moi called the accusations ``imaginary
things.''
   Moi is scheduled to meet Thursday with Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.,
the powerful chairman of the House foreign operations subcommittee
who has been a frequent critic of Kenya's human-rights record.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority announced Wednesday that the MTA is appealing a judge's
decision that struck down a rule against panhandling in the subways.
   Begging ``lends an air of disorder'' said MTA Chairman Robert
Kiley.
   U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand then issued a partial stay on
an injunction that barred the MTA from enforcing the rule. Sand put
back into effect, pending the appeal, one of his earlier orders
that allowed begging in the subway system except on subway cars,
narrow platforms and 25 feet from token booths.
   Kiley said he believes Sand was wrong when he decided Friday
that begging in public places is free speech protected by the First
Amendment.
   The ruling, Kiley said, was ``incorrect, unreasonable and
insensitive of the rights of the millions of passengers who use the
subways.''
   The MTA set into motion the appeal process by filing a notice of
appeal with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A motion to stay
the order is pending before Sand, who was to hear arguments later
Wednesday.
   Sand's ruling stemmed from a class-action lawsuit brought in
November by the Legal Action Customs official said Wednesday.
   India and Pakistan both claim Jammu-Kashmir. The 43-year-old
dispute heated up again when India launched a crackdown Jan. 20
against Kashmiri Moslems who want to secede from India.
   The customs official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the 10,000 copies of Newsweek that arrived at Bombay airport early
Wednesday have not been impounded. But he said a process often used
to speed up clearance for weekly magazines is not being used to
clear the Newsweek issue.
   Normally, consignments must be cleared against a bill of entry,
a procedure that can take up to two days. In cases considered
urgent, the consignments are cleared faster with an understanding
that bill of entry formalities will be completed later.
   ``This is a facility extended in rare cases, not as a matter of
right but for convenience,'' the customs official said.
   In previous disputes over maps in foreign publications, India
has allowed the books or magazines in question to enter the country
after stamping them with notations that the borders are ``neither
correct nor authenticated.''
   There was no indication whether this would happen to the
Newsweek map.
   Newsweek is distributed in India by Living Media India Ltd. A
company spokesman declined comment on the customs action.

   Baker is going to Europe primarily to hold talks in Moscow with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Baker provided no details of the visit to Prague, nor would he
say if he would make other stops in Europe. Baker is known to have
Romania under consideration, but turmoil in the country may rule
out a trip to Bucharest.
   Czech President Vaclav Havel's visit to Washington will include

<HEAD>Government Proposes Fuel Economy Standards for Trucks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday called for slight
increases in average minimum gasoline mileage for pickup trucks,
vans and utility vehicles for the 1992 through 1994 model years.
   The proposed standards, announced by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, would apply to vehicles with gross
weight ratings of up to 8,500 pounds.
   Currently, each company's light truck fleet manufactured in the
1990 model year must average 20 miles per gallon. The required
average for the 1991 model year is 20.2 mpg.
   The agency proposed a 1992 model year standard between 20.2 and
21 mpg, a 1993 standard between 20.2 and 21.5 mpg, and a 1994
standard between 20.2 and 22 mpg.
   The announcement opens a 30-day period for public comment, after
which the agency will make a final decision on fuel economy
standards for the three years.
   ``We have taken a careful look at the manufacturers' fuel
economy capabilities and have analyzed their current projections
and underlying product plans,'' administrator Jerry R. Curry said.
``We are asking for more information on possible technological
improvements, such as in engines and transmissions.''
   Federal law requires the agency to establish average fuel
economy standards for light trucks each year. A manufacturer that
fails to meet the standard, after taking credits into account, is
subject to civil penalties.
   The agency is required to set standards at the ``maximum
feasible level'' after considering economic practicability,
technological feasibility, the need to conserve energy and the
effect of other federal motor vehicle standards on fuel economy.
   The highway safety agency also said it would stop setting
separate standards for two-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive fleets
because nearly all manufacturers have chosen a combined fleet
standard.

<HEAD>Raise for Legislators Takes Effect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pay raise goes into effect Thursday for
members of Congress, with the Senate receiving a slightly higher
boost than the House.
   Federal judges and senior executive branch employees also will
be getting cost-of-living increases at the same rate as House
members, about 8 percent.
   Rank-and-file House members' salaries will go from $89,500 a
year to $96,600. Senators, now paid the same as House members, will
get a raise to $98,400.
   The reason for the difference is that the House last year
approved a comprehensive pay-and-ethics package that includes an
additional 25 percent pay boost effective next year in return for
the elimination of the widely criticized practice of lawmakers
accepting speaking fees from interest groups.
   But when the measure went to the other side of the Capitol,
senators balked and wound up accepting instead a 10 percent raise
and a cut in the limit on their speaking fees from $35,800 to
$26,568.
   For this year, House members can keep $26,850 in honoraria, the
same as in 1989.
   While senators are slightly ahead in the salary game for now,
the House will leap ahead on Jan. 1, 1991, when its next raise _
carefully timed to come after November's elections _ takes them to
$120,700, plus a yet-to-be-determined cost-of-living increment.
   Many in Congress believe that the discrepancy will prompt the
Senate to address the poltically painful pay issue again this year.

<TEXT>
   Some liberal Communists indicated
Wednesday there may be a split in the party, but one said his
reformist wing would not leave ``until the Stalinists throw us
out.''
   On the second day of a party congress, the reformers faced a
large conservative majority that entrenched itself during the 35
years Todor Zhivkov ruled the country before his downfall in
November.
   Uncertainty also appeared in the fledgling non-Communist
opposition, an alliance called the Union of Democratic Forces,
which seemed divided over when free elections should be held. The
Communists insisted they take place no later than May, but many in
the Union want more time to organize.
   Labor unrest continued, emphasizing the urgency of economic and
social problems. Most of the unprecedented strikes are for higher
pay.
   Teachers walked out as the congress opened Tuesday. Miners who
struck last week resumed work Wednesday, but continued negotiations
with the government.
   Doctors struck for one hour Tuesday, two hours Wednesday, and
announced plans to quit working for three hours Thursday. They want
the health minister and his deputies to resign.
   State television said elevator engineers planned to strike, but
gave no details of their demands.
   Official media carried a report quoting agricultural workers as
saying they would strike Feb. 5 unless the state paid adequate
prices for their crops.
   Party chief Petar Mladenov and other leaders held out the
possibility Wednesday of sharing some power with the oppposition
and called for a government of ``national concord.''
   Unlike their comrades elsewhere in rapidly changing Eastern
Europe, Bulgaria's Communists face a relatively weak opposition and
have not relinquished much power since Mladenov replaced Zhivkov on
Nov. 10.
   At the congress, party reformers appeared undecided on strategy.
   Dragomir Draganov, whose reformist wing is called Democratic
Forum, told reporters his group would stay in the party ``until the
Stalinists throw us out,'' but Nikolai Vassilev of the Alternative
Socialist Association left open the possibility of a split after
the congress.
   ``We cannot give a positive answer,'' Vassilev said. He added
that the Alternative Socialists would decide what to do at a
separate conference Feb. 11.
   Delegate Petar Emil Mitev of the reformist group called Road To
Europe said: ``Nothing fatal will happen if we (the Communists) go
into opposition for a while. Socialism will not die.''
   Where the opposition stood on the election was equally unclear.
   A statement carried by radio said Petar Beron, a leading member
of the Union of Democratic Forces, agreed to elections in May. A
subsequent Union statement read on television by spokesman Stefan
Stoyanov, however, said conditions were not right for elections to
be held so soon.
   In the statement read by Stoyanov, the Union said its demand
that the old party system be separated from the state had not been
fulfilled.
   The Union, which is engaged in negotiations with the Communists
and other groups, said the Communist Party must create ``real
conditions'' for an end to its monopoly on culture and the economy.
   On possible particiaption in a provisional coalition before
elections, it said the terms and the power of such a government
must be clarified.
   Party leaders moved the party congress up from 1991 after
Bulgaria was caught up in the tide of political change sweeping
Eastern Europe. It is scheduled to end Thursday.

   Relations between management and registered
nurses at the VA hospital in Albuquerque, N.M., have become so bad
that outside counseling is needed, according to a report released
Wednesday.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, said in its report that there had been progress in a
number of areas that registered nurses had complained about _
shortages of nurses, pay problems, excessive overtime, lack of
promotions and excessive disciplinary actions.
   However, two years of conflict means ``it will be difficult to
make the participants believe they can deal with the issues and
each other in an effective manner,'' the report said.
   ``To facilitate this process, we believe than an independent
human resource specialist should be brought in to enhance the
dialogue between the two groups,'' it said.
   Hospital spokesman Ron Lopez said officials there had not seen
the GAO report and he could not comment on whether recommended
changes had been implemented.
   Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski said in a statement
included in the report that some of the problems the nurses have
complained about deal with the rights of management and fall
outside union-management bargaining.
   Among the issues Derwinski said the VA had no obligation to
negotiate with the nurses over were temporary assignment to another
unit or ward for eight hours or less and the system of classifying
patients according to their nursing care needs.
   The report was requested in October 1988 by Sen. Pete V.
Domenici, D-N.M., as a result of complaints by nurses who are
members of Carpenters Union Local 2208.
   The hospital serves an area of New Mexico and western Texas that
serves about 200,000 veterans.
   The GAO study was done in the first six months of 1989.
Administrator Andrew Montano has resigned since then, but no
permanent director has been appointed.

   New homes sales in 1989, held back in part by
a 9.6 percent decline in December, posted their worst record in
five years, the government said Wednesday, but some analysts said
falling mortgage rates should boost sales in 1990.
   ``The year wasn't a gangbuster by any means,'' said Richard
Peach, an econmist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. ``But I
wouldn't characterize it as a disaster either.''
   Peach and others said they were ``confident that rates will be
coming down in the not too distant future,'' resulting in renewed
sales.
   The Commerce Department said new single-family homes were sold
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 629,000 units in December
after jumping 9.3 percent in November.
   Analysts said December's decline was due to severe weather in
much of the country and to a correction from November's
unsustainable pace.
   December sales brought to 650,000 units the total sold in 1989,
the worst year since 639,000 homes were sold in 1984. The 1989
total was 3.8 percent less than the 676,000 units sold in 1988.
   The construction industry was hampered through much of 1989 by
high interest rates.
   The Mortgage Bankers are forecasting sales in the
670,000-680,000 range this year, ``predicated on further declines
in mortgage rates,'' Peach said.
   But rates were again on the rise in January. David Berson, chief
economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association, said the
rates probably would hold down any January improvement.
   Robert Villanueva, director of forecasting for the National
Association of Home Builders, had similar worries.
   ``Our concerns are not really with December (sales), but with
the fact that interest rates have moved up rather smartly in
January,'' he said.
   On a regional basis, new home sales in December rose at an
annual rate of 4 percent in the Northeast to 105,000 units, but
fell elsewhere. Sales plummeted 28.3 percent to 91,000 units in the
Midwest and were off 9.1 percent to 190,000 units in the West and
6.2 percent to 243,000 units in the South.
   Yet sales for the year were up 6.2 percent to 103,000 units in
the Midwest, but down 11.9 percent to 89,000 units in the
Northeast, 6.2 percent to 259,000 units in the South and 1.5
percent to 199,000 units in the West.
   The Commerce Department also reported the median price of a new
home rose 4.1 percent in December to $130,100, and 6.7 percent in
1989 to $121,000. The median means that half of the homes cost
more, half less.
   On the other hand, the average price of a home in December rose
5.1 percent to $159,800. It was up 8 percent to $147,700 for the
year.
   In another housing report Wednesday, the National Association of
Realtors said December declines in mortgage rates helped boost its
index measuring the ability of the typical American family to buy
an existing home.
   The index measured 108.2 in December, meaning that a family
earning the national median income of $33,600 had 108.2 percent of
the income needed to qualify for conventional financing covering 80
percent of a home priced at $92,500, the median existing home price
for that month. The index was at 105.5 in November.

   Gen. Michel Aoun's soldiers attacked the
Lebanese Forces militia Wednesday to try to gain full control of
the Christian zone. Police reported scores of casualties, and a
nurse described a morgue ``packed'' with bodies.
   Police said at least 35 people were killed and 85 wounded in
daylong tank and artillery battles that sent stray shells crashing
in Moslem west Beirut and its southern slums, which were not
involved in the fighting.
   Reports indicated Aoun's 20,000 troops, led by the U.S.-trained
8th Brigade, had the upper hand in tank and artillery battles in
the 310-square-mile enclave, where 1 million Christians live.
   Police said the militia's overland supply lines were cut, but it
has sea links between its headquarters in east Beirut and the ports
of Byblos and Jounieh north of the capital.
   The Lebanese Forces however said in a late-night communique it
had captured Aoun's naval base in Kaslik and the Sarba helicopter
base near the port of Jounieh.
   Meanwhile, Shiite Moslem militias fought in southern Lebanon,
continuing the latest round of their intermittent struggle for
supremacy among the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect.
   Four people were reported wounded, raising the toll to 98 killed
and 280 wounded in the battle that began Dec. 23 between the
fundamentalist Hezbollah, which is loyal to Iran, and Amal, a
mainstream militia backed by Syria.
   The fighting in the Christian zone was the worst since February
1989, when Aoun's troops last moved against the Lebanese Forces,
the main Christian militia led by Samir Geagea. More than 80 people
were killed and 200 wounded in that four-day conflict.
   Aoun's gunners in the hills east of Beirut hammered Geagea's
seafront headquarters in the Karantina district with heavy 155mm
howitzer barrages.
   Geagea's fighters hit back with salvos of rockets from launchers
that spat 40 missiles a minute on the shell-wrecked presidential
palace in suburban Baabda, where Aoun has his headquarters.
   Police said both leaders were reported to be unharmed.
   Exploding shells and rockets streaked over the burning Christian
sector of the city and lighted up the night sky.
   A police statement said at least 28 people were killed and 69
wounded from fierce daylong battles with tanks and artillery in the
Christian sector and north Lebanon.
   ``This is an initial count. The toll is definitely much higher
as scores of other casualties were still bleeding in embattled
areas that ambulances and rescuers could not reach,'' the statement
said.
   At least seven civilians, including a 6-month-old baby, were
killed and 16 wounded by stray shells that exploded in west and
south Beirut, the city's Moslem sectors, police said.
   Hospitals broadcast appeals over all Christian radio stations
for urgent blood donations to cope with what one nurse at the Hotel
Dieu French missionary hospital, the biggest in east Beirut, called
a ``deluge of casualties.''
   ``The morgue is packed and dozens of wounded are bleeding on
stretchers in corridors,'' said the nurse, who asked not to be
identified.
   Stray shells exploded around the ports of Beirut and Jounieh,
forcing 18 ships to steam for open sea, police said.
   One of the injured was news photographer George Samarejian of
the independent An-Nahar daily. Police said Samarejian, 45, was
shot in the head and taken to the Saint George Hospital. But no
surgeon was immediately available to operate on him.
   A police spokesman reported house-to-house combat in some
residential areas of Christian east Beirut. Geagea said his 6,000
men were fighting ``for our survival.''
   ``We shall respond to each shell with 10 shells,'' he said in a
statement broadcast by Christian radio stations. ``We shall not
allow those blinded by the lust for power to slaughter the Lebanese
Forces.''
   Both sides ignored cease-fire appeals from the Vatican and
Lebanon's Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir.
   Aoun's headquarters said in a communique that his troops overran
the Lebanese Force's seaside barracks at Safra, Fanar, Mar Roukos
and Nahr Ibrahim, a cluster of towns along a 10-mile stretch of the
highway north of Beirut.
   Geagea's headquarters denied Aoun's claim and the militia's TV
station showed footage of its fighters controlling Aoun's main air
force base in Halat and the general's Sabra barracks and Kaslik
naval base.
   Whoever wins, the battle could break the stalemate over an Arab
League peace plan aimed at ending a 15-year-old civil war that has
cost 150,000 Lebanese their lives.
   Aoun opposes the accord worked out in October because it does
not guarantee withdrawal of Syrian forces, which he calls an
occupation army. Aoun also refuses to recognize President Elias
Hrawi, who was elected as part of the accord.
   Geagea has neither accepted or rejected the peace accord, but
has recognized Hrawi as president. He and other right-wing
Christians oppose Aoun's rebellion.
   Aoun, increasingly isolated and facing the prospect of a
Syrian-backed assault by the 22,000 soldiers loyal to the Hrawi
government, apparently felt he had to secure control of the
Christian sector.
   Fighting began when Aoun's troops attacked the Lebanese Forces
after skirmishes Tuesday.

   President Bush, preparing to deliver his first
State of the Union address, telephoned Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Wednesday to propose deeper cuts in U.S. and Soviet
combat troops in Europe, officials said.
   Bush was to announce the plan formally in a nationally broadcast
appearance before a joint session of Congress. The proposal, to
reduce forces of each country to 195,000 in the affected area, was
described by senior administration officials as a response to the
``rapidly falling deck of cards'' in Eastern Europe amid the
collapse of hardline communist regimes.
   The proposal won immediate praise from Democrats, including Sen.
Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who said it fit
``the changing circumstances in Europe and the fiscal pressures at
home.''
   The troop-cutback plan was the surprising centerpiece of a
speech in which Bush also was to proclaim the nation in good
health, set lofty goals for America's schools and warn Democrats
not to cut Social Security taxes.
   Moreover, Bush was to prod Congress again for action on capital
gains tax cuts and legislation dealing with clean air, child care
and crime, all of which are pending from last year.
   The plan would force a cutback in the more than 265,000 U.S.
troops in Western Europe and the 565,000 Soviet forces in Central
and Eastern Europe.
   However, there are an additional 40,000 U.S. troops in Britain,
Italy, Greece and Turkey who would not be affected by the latest
plan.
   Last May, Bush proposed a 275,000 ceiling throughout all of
Europe on U.S. and Soviet forces and said negotiations to reach
that goal should be wrapped up within a year.
   The administration said Soviet and U.S. negotiators should
proceed with talks to reach the 275,000 level while holding
parallel discussions on the deeper cuts.
   A senior official said, ``We see no reason there has to be an
interference'' with reaching the 275,000 level. ``If there is, we
will put it on the back burner until we can get there.''
   Before now, Bush has said he would not support further cuts
until the current talks were wrapped up. But, a senior
administration official said, ``Events were running ahead of the
negotiations.''
   The 1989 proposal, still under negotiation, would require the
United States to withdraw 30,000 combat troops and force the
Soviets to reduce their troops by about 325,000.
   The official, who briefed reporters on Bush's speech on
condition of anonymity, called the collapse of the Soviet empire
``a rapidly falling deck of cards.''
   On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said
that ``very substantial reductions are not only possible but I
think inevitable.''
   Bush sent Lawrence Eagleburger, his deputy secretary of state,
and Robert Gates, the deputy national security adviser, to present
his plan and seek approval from the leaders of England, France,
Germany and Italy. They returned Tuesday evening with endorsements
of Bush's package, the official said.
   With that, Bush then called Gorbachev to inform him of the
proposal.
   ``He was very appreciative of the president's phone call and
thought that this was the kind of attitude that was very conducive
to good relations and he said, of course, that they would study the
proposal,'' the official said.
   Bush has repeatedly cautioned that there would be no immediate
budgetary ``peace dividend'' of military savings from the changes
in Eastern Europe. The senior administration official said the
deeper troop reductions would not affect that position since any
cutbacks would have to be negotiated. Many analysts have said it
costs about as much to maintain troops in Europe as it does in the
United States and real savings must come from a smaller military
establishment.
   The first hint of a new proposal came from Secretary of State
James A. Baker III. Discussing Bush's conversation with Gorbachev,
Baker said, ``It had to do with some announcements that the
president will have tonight in his State of the Union message, and
beyond that I am not going to say anything further.''
   Baker will see Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
and possibly Gorbachev in Moscow on Feb. 8-9.
   On the domestic front, Bush's proposal for a capital gains tax
cut had been criticized by Democrats as merely a tax cut for the
rich.
   However, John Sununu, Bush's chief of staff, said, ``I think all
of a sudden about April or May, it will dawn on Congress that it's
a congressional election, not a presidential election year, and
that failures to get things done will be seen as failures of the
Democrat leadership in the House, the Democrat leadership in the
Senate,'' he said.
   Bush gave a preview of his speech to Republican senators and
House members during a meeting at the White House.
   Afterward, House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said Bush
pledged to point out in his speech that he is opposed to a rollback
in Social Security taxes, as proposed by Sen. Daniel Moynihan,
D-N.Y.
   Referring to Moynihan's proposal, Michel said, ``It just means
it's a no-no as far as our party's concerned. We've made that
decision earlier on to fund this program adequately into the next
century. And to do violence to that ... just really undermines our
credibility.''
   Moynihan has said his proposal was prompted by concern that the
growing Social Security trust fund reserves are being used to mask
the true size of the federal deficit.
   Seeking to redeem his pledge to be ``the education president,''
Bush was setting a goal of lifting American students to first place
internationally in math and science, two subjects where they
traditionally rate poorly.
   For example, one study has shown that 72 percent of South Korean
13-year-olds can solve a math problem that only 40 percent of
Americans that age can solve.
   There was a hint of this in Bush's budget, which proposes $230
million _ a 70 percent increase _ in money for states to improve
the abilities of teachers in those two disciplines.
   In addition, National Science Foundation programs for science,
math and engineering education would receive a $100 million
increase, to $460 million, under Bush's proposal.

   At least 10 birds were found dead and seaweed farms
were damaged after fuel oil leaked from a 7,000-ton Liberian
freighter that ran aground and broke in two off western Japan,
officials and fishermen said Wednesday.
   An official of the Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast guard,
reported a 660-by-70-foot oil slick off Ine, about 490 miles
southwest of Tokyo. He said the agency set up a barrier to keep the
spill offshore.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Maritime Gardenia struck a rock last Thursday in rough seas a mile
off the coast.
   All 23 Filipino and Chinese crewmen were rescued by a
helicopter, but the ship broke in two and an estimated 900 tons of
fuel oil leaked, the official said.
   He said the Maritime Gardenia, owned by International Maritime
Carriers Co. of Hong Kong, was heading for another dock after
unloading lumber from Malaysia when it ran aground.
   Yoshiyuki Hamano, an official of the fishermen's cooperative in
Ine village, said 10 sea birds coated with fuel oil were found dead
on the coast and seaweed farming was damaged, but the full extent
of the damage was not immediately known.

   Three ethnic Albanians were reported
killed in riots Wednesday in Kosovo, and more than 100,000 Slavs
rallied at anti-Albanian protests elsewhere in Yugoslavia, some
demanding arms to fight in the province.
   At least 16 people have died in ethnic riots that began eight
days ago in the poor southern province adjacent to Albania. Among
Kosovo's 1.9 million inhabitants, ethnic Albanians outnumber Slavs
9-1.
   A federal police official said the actual toll was ``much
higher.'' He insisted on anonymity and gave no figure.
   State-run TV described the situation as on ``the verge of civil
war.''
   Up to 100,000 Slavs, some firing into the air, staged a rally in
Titograd, capital of the Montenegrin republic. Some demonstrators
volunteered to go to Kosovo and fight ethnic ``Albanian
nationalists.''
   Kosovo is an administrative part of Yugoslavia's largest
republic of Serbia. Its ethnic Albanians want more autonomy, a stop
to political trials, release of political prisoners and lifting of
a year-old state of emergency.
   The state news agency Tanjug said three people were killed and
five injured Wednesday in Glogovac, a village 12 miles south of
Pristina, capital of Kosovo. It said police used a helicopter to
disperse ``several thousand aggressive'' protesters there.
   Belgrade TV showed the huge rally of Slavs in Titograd. Gunfire
could be heard and speakers implored demonstrators to stop firing
handguns.
   One speaker said Montenegrin volunteers were signing up to fight
in Kosovo unless the authorities there ``use all available methods,
including repression,'' to end ``the Albanian uprising.''
   At Ivangrad, a Montenegrin town, 10,000 people demonstrated
against ``Albanian separatists and Slovenian and Croatian leaders
supporting them,'' Tanjug said.
   In Belgrade, the federal and Serbian capital, crowds estimated
by reporters to be in the thousands held rallies. The
demonstrations were purportedly anti-Albanian, but protesters also
chanted ``Down with Communism!'' and ``Down with Tito,'' the late
Yugoslav president held responsible by the Serbs for originally
giving wide autonomy to Kosovo.
   Up to 5,000 students assembled before the federal Parliament
building at midnight Tuesday demanding weapons to fight for the
minority Slavs in Kosovo.
   They proclaimed a general strike and demanded the ``highest
organs of the federation'' resign unless ``nationalist and
vandalist rioting of (ethnic Albanian) terrorists'' stopped within
48 hours.
   The Kosovo conflict arises from ethnic friction between majority
Albanians and minority Serbs and Montenegrins. The republics of
Slovenia, and to a lesser extent Croatia, have sided with the
ethnic Albanians and the rally in Titograd had anti-Slovene
overtones.
   Ethnic Albanians began protesting a year ago when Serbia made
constitutional changes to take firmer control of the autonomous
province. At least 28 people died in violence in Kosovo over the
issue last year.
   Demonstrators shouted Wednesday for the resignation of
Yugoslavia's collective presidency and its current leader, Janez
Drnovsek, a Slovene.
   The presidency issued a statement assuring Yugoslavs ``that the
country possesses the means and force to carry out its obligations
and prevent all forms of terrorism.''
   It said ``the situation in Kosovo is deteriorating,'' and warned
of the threat of ``bloody clashes among nationalities.''
   As violence spread through Kosovo on Wednesday, protesters
called for military intervention to end ``the Albanian uprising.''
   At Vucitrn, 20 miles northwest of Pristina, five demonstrators
were reported injured, apparently in clashes with police.
   Violent clashes were reported in Lipljan, Titova Mitrovica,
Klina, Prizren, Kosovska Kamenica and Gnjilane.
   Authorities warned that ``traveling through Kosovo is extremely
dangepous.'' Young ethnic Albanians, armed with guns, were reported
to be stopping cars and checking identities.
   About 4,000 demonstrators assembled in Podujevo, the main
hotspot 20 miles north of Pristina. About 3,000 others rallied in
Pec, 30 miles northwest of the provincial capital.
   Media reports said police guarded all Serb and Montenegrin
communities in Kosovo.
   At Malisevo, where Radio Pristina reported two deaths Tuesday,
three ethnic Albanians were buried Wednesday at a ceremony attended
by 2,000 people.
   Police using tear gas prevented 200 ethnic Albanians from
joining 200 others in the streets of Titova Mitrovica, 25 miles
northwest of Pristina, and a protest was reported in Ada, 10 miles
west of the provincial capital.
   Strikes were reported at several factories in support of the
protesters.

   A St. Croix
businessman has been convicted of looting a grocery store after
Hurricane Hugo struck in September and selling the food in his
restaurant.
   Michael Harris, 46, a native of New York who owns the Ritz Cafe,
faces a possible 50 years in prison for grand larceny and burglary.
The verdict was delivered Tuesday night in a federal court and no
date was set for sentencing.
   Harrisk was the third prominent resident of St. Croix convicted
for looting, which was widespread after Hugo devastated the island
on Sept. 17.
   ``We as a community can say to the rest of the world that has
looked down on us that we have respect for law and order,'' U.S.
Attorney David Nissman told the court Tuesday night.
   The trial of police Capt. Adelbert Bryan, a former territorial
senator, began Wednesday in U.S. district court. He is accused of
stealing gas lanterns and lumber from a hardware store.
   Nissman said his job was to ``restore order, restore confidence
in the legal system and to bring significant looters to trial.''
   He said of Harris: ``This is a case of a prominent businessman
who acquired a lot of property he did not pay for and sold it at a
very high profit.''
   In his defense, Harris told the court he donated 750 meals to
military and federal emergency personnel in the days after the
storm.
   Early in January, the owner of an electronic supply store was
convicted of possessing stolen property acquired after the storm
and a First Federal Bank executive was convicted of trying to steal
goods from a department store.
   Hugo destroyed most homes on St. Croix and caused an estimated
$1 billion in damage in the Virgin Islands, a U.S. territory in the
Caribbean with a population of 110,000.

   Sir Georg Solti, the famed conductor who has won
more Grammy Awards than anyone, unveiled plans Wednesday for his
farewell season with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, including a
hoped-for tour of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   ``America has here a messenger, in this orchestra, that is
unparalleled by any politician, unparalleled by any ambassador,''
the 77-year-old Solti said at a news conference, which he attended
despite a lingering case of flu.
   ``What is essential that we show them what we can produce _ not
in armaments, and not in missiles _ but in Beethoven and
Shostakovich.''
   The trip would be the group's first to the Soviet Union _ either
to Moscow or Leningrad _ and would include performances in Vienna
and Budapest, Solti's birthplace, orchestra officials said.
   ``Logistical problems,'' including uncertainties over lodging
and food, have made the plans tentative so far, but the orchestra
hopes to reach a decision within two weeks, officials said. If all
three stops cannot be arranged, the tour will not take place, they
said.
   The trip would come during the group's centennial season, which
will run from September 1990 through April 1991.
   ``Something is quite wonderful, to be part of an orchestra which
will be 100 years old,'' said Solti, who will have headed the group
for 22 years.
   ``One-fifth of the existence of this orchestra, I have been
honored to be its music director,'' he said. ``It's remarkable, and
I feel very, very rich.''
   The program for the centennial season, which runs from September
1990 to April 1991, will be crowned by Verdi's opera ``Otello,''
with Luciano Pavarotti performing the title role for the first
time, Solti said.
   Solti, who has won 29 Grammys, six more than the No. 2 lifetime
winner, the late concert pianist Vladimir Horowitz, also announced
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra will make its third trip to the
Orient this spring.
   Six conductors, including Solti, and Daniel Barenboim, his
successor-designate at the Chicago Symphony beginning in the
1991-92 season, will lead 12 concerts in Japan during April.
   The trip will be funded largely through a $750,000 gift _ the
single largest corporate donation the orchestra has ever received _
from Motorola Inc., said Richard L. Thomas, chairman of the
Orchestral Association.
   Solti said Japanese audiences were marvelous to the orchestra
during its previous trips to their country, the last in 1986, and
he loves the opportunity to showcase U.S. orchestral excellence.
   ``In many fields, to my great sadness, America is going down,''
he said. ``Here is where neither the Japanese nor the Germans can
compete with us, and this is one point when we should feel very
proud.''

<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador
said U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar agreed
Wednesday to try to restart peace talks between the government and
rebels in the Central American nation.
   ``We feel positive and hopeful that we will be able to
re-establish the dialogue process and that hopefully we will find
that political solution that we are all anxious for in our
country,'' Cristiani told reporters after meeting the U.N. chief.
   Cristiani did not make clear if he sought a U.N. role in
mediating if agreement is reached to resume negotiations that broke
off last November.
   He said only that Perez de Cuellar ``will personally make all
efforts possible to have the dialogue process reinitiated in order
to look for a political solution to the Salvadoran conflict.''
   A U.N. spokesman said ``the secretary-general has been entrusted
with the task of helping them clear the way for negotiations.''
Asked if that would involve a direct mediation role, he said,
``This is an internal Salvadoran problem. It is for the parties of
El Salvador to negotiate a settlement.''
   Earlier Wednesday, protesters urging an end to U.S. aid to El
Salvador confronted Cristiani's motorcade as it arrived at the
United Nations. He entered the building from the underground
parking garage instead of the main entrance.
   Police arrested 28 people on charges of disorderly conduct for
blocking the street in front of the United Nations, a New York City
police spokesman said.
   About 200 demonstrators had gathered, carrying banners and
chanting slogans denouncing U.S. aid to El Salvador and accusing
the Cristiani government of sponsoring death squads.
   El Salvador received $378 million in U.S. aid last year,
including $80 million in military aid. Over the past eight years,
the United States has provided more than $3.2 billion to El
Salvador, including $1 billion in military equipment.
   Cristiani is due to meet President Bush in Washington Thursday.
U.S. officials said they will discuss the case of six slain Jesuit
priests, which drew a world outcry and prompted demands from some
U.S. lawmakers that aid to Cristiani's government be cut off.
   Cristiani's government says army members killed the six Jesuits,
their housekeeper and her daughter in San Salvador on Nov. 16 _
days after guerrillas of the leftist Faribundo Marti National
Liberation Front, or FMLN, launched an offensive in the capital.
   Cristiani said Wednesday his government has ``given a clear sign
to anybody that likes to take violence in his hands to solve
problems that the present government of El Salvador is not willing
to accept violence as a means to solve any problems.''
   Negotiations between the government and rebels broke off after a
union headquarters was bombed and the FMLN mounted the major
assault in November. More than 1,000 people died in the fighting.

   The Soviet Embassy on Wednesday confirmed that
it has shipped four MI-17 helicopters to Nicaragua recently but
said the aircraft were built for civilian use.
   The embassy statement, issued in response to news reports about
the shipment, did not rule out the possibility that the helicopters
may be diverted for military use.
   But hours earlier, Secretary of State James A. Baker said the
Soviets have given assurances that helicopters sent to Nicaragua
will not be outfitted for military purposes.
   The Soviet statement reaffirmed the Soviet position that Moscow
has sent no weapons to Nicaragua since early 1989.
   The helicopter delivery was completed last week. The shipment
initally was to have been made in December but, for undisclosed
reasons, the vessel carrying the aircraft returned to a Soviet port
and delivery was delayed by more than a month, officials said.
   Baker said that MI-17's in the past have been used by Nicaragua
for military purposes _ ``refitted and weapons put on them.''
   ``We have ... received some assurances from (the Soviets) that
that is not going to be the case with respect to the helicopters in
question. If it were the case, as far as we are concerned, the
Soviet Union would not be keeping with the pledge that it has given
us that it is not going to continue to supply lethal weapons to
Nicaragua.''
   The Soviet statement took note of the news reports about the
shipment, pointing out that some had claimed the helicopter
delivery violated a Kremlin moratorium on arms shipments to the
Sandinistas.
   ``In fact, in accordance with the agreement between the
governments of the USSR and Nicaragua concluded in February 1988,
the Soviet Union has delivered to Nicaragua four MI-17 helicopters
built for civilian use,'' it said.
   ``Therefore, the shipment of these helicopters doesn't go beyond
the framework of usual commercial practice based on the existing
obligations for supplies of civilian property.''
   On a related issue, Baker said he intends to discuss with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze a recent Soviet shipment of
MiG-29 jet fighters to Cuba.
   Columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novack said in their column
Wednesday that six of these aircraft left for Cuba in early January
by sea and that 30 more will be sent at a later date.
   Baker holds talks with Shervardnadze in Moscow next week.

   Lightning change in the Soviet bloc has
prompted President Bush to take a step he balked at just eight
weeks ago, proposing further cuts in the number of superpower
troops in Central Europe.
   ``Events in Eastern Europe, with the collapse of communist
regimes,'' pressure from the allies and a domestic clamor for the
``peace dividend'' persuaded Bush to use his State of the Union
address to offer sharper reductions than envisioned in multilateral
talks now underway in Europe, a senior administration official told
reporters Wednesday.
   Troops are the costliest item in the Pentagon budget, especially
those stationed overseas, and are expected to be a prime target of
congressional budget cutters reviewing Bush's new 1991 spending
plan in hopes of finding money for favored domestic programs.
   With his proposal, Bush also demonstrates anew that he is
capable of springing the type of surprise he delights in.
   Superpower talks on cutting conventional armies in Europe have
quickened over the last 13 months, after being stalled for 14 years
while NATO and the Warsaw Pact dickered over how many of what were
stationed where.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev shifted the talks into
high gear in December 1988 with his surprise announcement that he
was cutting global Soviet troop strength by 10 percent and
withdrawing six tank divisions from Europe.
   NATO leaders told Gorbachev they wanted much sharper Warsaw Pact
cuts in Europe. Last May, Bush proposed that the Americans and
Soviets set a ceiling of 275,000 troops apiece.
   More than 265,000 U.S. troops are in Western Europe, and 565,000
Soviet forces are in Central and Eastern Europe. There are an
additional 35,000 U.S. troops in Britain, Italy, Greece and Turkey
that would not be affected by Bush's latest plan.
   Additionally, Gorbachev has agreed to a step that analysts
consider more important in assuring that the Soviets would not be
able to launch a surprise attack. He has accepted a NATO proposal
to cut the number of Soviet tanks in Central Europe from 53,000 to
about 20,000, while the Western alliance reduces its tank arsenal
from 23,000 to 20,000.
   At their Malta sumit in December, Bush and Gorbachev said they
hoped to sign the conventional force in Europe talks _ known as CFE
_ by the end of the year at a summit involving leaders of the 16
NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations.
   Bush's proposal would be part of follow-up negotiations, known
among arms-control specialists as CFE-2.
   At a news conference after the Malta summit, Bush said he wanted
to complete the first treaty before discussing its successor.
   But since then, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have
announced troop cuts of their own and asked the Kremlin to withdraw
all its forces from their territory. And the leader of East Germany
has said that all superpower troops could be out of Europe by the
year 2000.
   It became apparent, a senior administration official said,
``that events in Eastern Europe, with the collapse of Communist
regimes, with discussions with Eastern Europeans suggesting the
Soviets ought to pull their troops out and so on, that the CFE
proposal we made last May at NATO and is now being negotiated was
perhaps not where we ought to be at the present time.''
   ``It appeared that in the area of arms control, specifically
conventional arms control in Europe, that events were running ahead
of the negotiations,'' said the source, speaking on condition he
not be further identified.
   ``So the president asked for a review of what made sense and,
following discussions with his advisers and military leaders, he
came up with a proposal which would be designed to maintain U.S.
interests in Europe,'' said the official.
   Bush's new plan brought immediate applause from Capitol Hill.
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga. and chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
called it ``very positive,'' noting that last December he advocated
a troop-level reduction to between 200,000 and 225,000.
   ``The Senate will be receptive to it,'' Nunn said of the Bush
proposal.
   The long feared Soviet potential to launch a surprise attack has
virtually disappeared over the last year, said Ted Warner, a
military analyst at the Rand Corp.
   The Soviets have completed about half the troop and tank
reductions that Gorbachev announced in December 1988, according to
Warner and an administration analyst who also spoke on the
condition he not be further identified.
   Moreover, the collapse of hardline Communist regimes means that
the Warsaw Pact ``could by no means count on any contribution from
its East European allies to mount an offensive against NATO,''
Warner said.
   ``When all is said and done, they have lost a great deal of
armored striking power,'' he said.
   As a result, Bush has decided that means U.S. troops stationed
in Europe during the Cold War can begin to come home.

<HEAD>Lebanon Panel Reportedly Proposes Emergency Arab Summit</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Lebanon</HEAD>

   The three Arab countries that
brokered a Lebanese peace plan want an emergency summit to discuss
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun's refusal to recognize Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi, an Arab diplomat said Wednesday.
   The diplomat, Rafik al-Natsheh of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, spoke a day after an Arab League panel of the three
countries _ Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Morocco _ circulated its
latest report.
   Al-Natsheh, recognized as the ambassador of Palestine by Saudi
Arabia, said by phone from Riyadh that the group proposed an
emergency Arab summit to discuss Aoun's stand.
   Aoun says the peace plan reached in October does not contain a
clear timetable for full withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops in
Lebanon, who originally entered the country in 1976 under a
peacekeeping mandate from the 22-member Arab League.
   Hrawi, a Moslem elected to lead the new government formed under
terms of the peace accord, was quoted in a Beirut interview as
saying he welcomed a summit to consider the crisis.
   Other diplomats said the proposal was expected to pick up steam
in coming days and that a date and venue would be decided in
contacts by the league headquarters in Tunis with Arab capitals.
   There were persistent reports in pro-government newspapers in
the Persian Gulf Arab countries that Egypt was likely to host the
summit in February or early March.
   The same diplomats said a summit would also deal with Egyptian
plans for a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue to break the stalemated
Middle East peacemaking process.
   Also on the agenda is the outcry from the PLO and Arab states
against resettlement of Soviet and Eastern European Jews in the
Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Arab League peace plan was endorsed by the Lebanese
Parliament members at a three-week conference in the Saudi mountain
resort of Taif in October.
   Parliament then met in Lebanon to elect a president of the
republic, Rene Mouawad, and swiftly re-convened to elect Hrawi
after Mouawad was assassinated by remote-controlled bomb.
   When the Taif agreement was concluded, Saudi leaders pledged in
the name of the three-man committee to remain in close touch with
Lebanese leaders until a full settlement was reached.
   They affirmed that Syria had insisted it was not interested in
remaining in Lebanon indefinitely. They said the panel would work
to have an Arab summit conference guarantee full implementation of
the Taif accord, implicitly meaning the Syrian pullout.

<HEAD>Panel Finds Sims Eligible for Death Penalty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jurors on Wednesday found Paula Marie Sims
eligible for the death penalty for the murder of her 6-week-old
daughter, and now must decide whether to sentence her to death by
lethal injection.
   A red-eyed Mrs. Sims, who contends a masked gunman abducted
Heather Lee Sims last year as well as her firstborn daughter in
1986, displayed no reaction when the decision was announced.
   The Madison County Circuit Court jury, which deliberated about
two hours, will hear further arguments before considering whether
to impose the death penalty or a lesser sentence.
   This third phase of the trial begins Thursday, and will center
on any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, said Assistant
Madison County State's Attorney Donald Weber.
   Weber and defense attorney Donald Groshong both declined to
comment on Wednesday's decision.
   Weber argued Wednesday that the death penalty was warranted in
the April 29 suffocation of Heather Lee Sims because the slaying
was planned and the crime was ``cruel, brutal, grossly ruthless and
devoid of mercy and compassion.''
   Under Illinois law, prosecutors may seek the death penalty under
certain circumstances, including cases in which the victim is under
12 years old and the killing is particularly brutal, or in which
there are multiple victims.
   Mrs. Sims, 30, of Alton contends a masked gunman abducted
Heather Lee and, three years earlier, 13-day-old Loralei.
   No murder charges have been filed in Loralei's death, but Mrs.
Sims faces trial in Jersey County on charges of obstruction of
justice and concealment of a homicide in connection with the death.
   Mrs. Sims continues to maintain her innocence, Groshong told the
panel Wednesday.
   But he also argued, ``We cannot say the death of this child was
premeditated, prolonged or torturous. ... In the pecking order of
evil ... smothering is usually considered more merciful than other
forms of killing.''
   The jury Tuesday found Mrs. Sims guilty of first-degree murder,
obstructing justice and concealing a homicide in Heather Lee's
death.
   Mrs. Sims and her husband, Robert, reported Heather abducted
April 29 from their home. Her body was found May 3 in a trash
barrel across the Mississippi River in nearby West Alton, Mo. An
autopsy indicated she had been suffocated and that her body was
then frozen.

<TEXT>
   Frantisek Pitra, the last old
guard Communist left in power by the peaceful revolution, resigned
Wednesday as leader of the Czech republic, the official news agency
CTK reported.
   The 57-year-old Pitra also is expected to give up his job as
deputy premier after Parliament approves his resignation from the
Czech post.
   He had strong links with the orthodox Communist leadership that
ruled from 1968, when Soviet tanks crushed a reform movement, until
the pro-democracy revolution last fall. He lost his seat on the
party Politburo in November, along with party leader Milos Jakes
and others.
   Pitra survived as Czech premier, however, after making his
republic's government the first in Czechoslovakia since 1948 that
was not dominated by Communists. That paved the way for similar
changes at the federal level.
   The Czech premier automatically is deputy premier of the
national government.
   CTK did not give the reason for Pitra's resignation, which came
a day after the Communists ended 40 years of dominance in
Parliament by giving more than 100 of their seats to pro-democracy
groups. The realignment completed an effort to include those groups
in Parliament before the free elections set for June 8.
   Parliament swore in 120 new deputies Tuesday their troops out and so
on, that the CFE
proposal we made last May at NATO and is now being negotiated was
perhaps not where we ought to be at the present time.''
   ``It appeared that in the area of arms control, specifically
conventional arms control in Europe, that events were running ahead
of the negotiations,'' said the source, speaking on condition he
not be further identified.
   ``So the president asked for a review of what made sense and,

   Bush's new plan brought immediate applause from Capitol Hill.
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga. and chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
called it ``very positive,'' noting that last December he advocated
a troop-level reduction to between 200,000 and 225,000.
   ``I believe that it makes the arms control proposal that we have
on the table much more relevant to the changing circumstances in
Europe,'' Nunn said. ``The Senate will be receptive to it.''
   The long-feared Soviet potential to launch a surprise attack has
virtually disappeared over the last year, said Ted Warner, a
military analyst at the Rand Corp.
   The Soviets have completed about half the troop and tank

<HEAD>Prison Chief Quits Following Guerrilla Escape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of the nation's prisons quit
Wednesday following the escape of 49 leftist guerrillas who spent a
year secretly tunneling their way to freedom.
   Six were captured shortly after they fled Tuesday but police
continued to search for the 43 others, who included several
guerrillas who tried to kill military President Augusto Pinochet in
1986.
   The Supreme Court appointed a special investigator, Justice Juan
Araya, who said he started his work ``immediately.''
   Justice Minister Hugo Rosende said the government ``immediately
accepted'' the resignation submitted by prison chief Col. Horacio
Ojeda. Rosende did not elaborate but it appeared Ojeda took
responsibility for the jail break.
   The guerrillas fled through a 100-yard-long tunnel below a wide
avenue, across the street from the national investigative police
headquarters in downtown Santiago.
   Adm. Jose Toribio Merino, commander in chief of the navy, said
on television that he believed some prison guards helped the
escapees.
   ``Imagine, they spent a full year digging a tunnel and no one
saw anything,'' Merino said. ``Where did they put all the material
they removed?''
   The government said it ordered an internal investigation of
prison personnel.
   The Santiago newspaper La Segunda reported that the officer in
charge of the prison at the time of the escape was warned by some
guards that ``something abnormal'' was happening, but that he paid
no attention.
   It said the officer, identified only as Lt. Gutierrez, ordered
the guards to retrieve the cartridges from their automatic rifles
after one guard fired a warning shot into the air.
   Authorities did not comment on the paper's report.
   Police searching for the guerrillas set up roadblocks and
increased security at airports and borders points. National police
director, Fernando Paredes, appealed to ``all citizens to help us
providing whatever information they think may be useful.''
   Police also were seen watching many embassies in Santiago,
apparently in an effort to prevent the escapees from seeking asylum.
   Most of them were members of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic
Front, an urban guerrilla gang that has claimed responsibility for
a number of armed attacks against Chile's military regime,
including the attempt on Pinochet's life on Sept. 7, 1986.
   Pinochet was unharmed when his motorcade was ambushed in the
Andes foothills near Santiago, but six of his bodyguards were
killed.
   Pinochet took power following a 1973 coup that topped elected
President Salvador Allende. He is scheduled to turn over power to a
civilian government in February.

   The final defendant in the McMartin preschool
molestation case will be retried on the 13 counts of child
molestation and conspiracy that left jurors deadlocked, prosecutors
announced Wednesday.
   The decision to retry Raymond Buckey came after long meetings
with District Attorney Ira Reiner and after a loud public campaign
by parents whose children attended the McMartin nursery school.
   The parents appeared on television, called news conferences,
enlisted politicians and solicited letters supporting Buckey's
reprosecution.
   ``This is a positive step for us,'' said Marymae Cioffi, a
McMartin parent who led the campaign to retry Buckey. ``I'm going
to run home and tell my kids we get another chance.''
   Reiner said that neither the orchestrated outcry nor by his
stated ambition to run for California attorney general had any
influence on his decision to seek a new trial.
   ``This is not a political matter and it is not going to be
treated as such,'' he said.
   Reiner said he did not watch the sensational TV talk show
appearances by parents and children. He added that boxes of letters
carried into his office this week by a delegation of parents
contained only about 200 letters rather than the 6,000 they claimed
to have collected.
   ``The boxes were filled with rolls of paper,'' he said. ``Only
the top row were letters. There's a little bit of that going on.''
   ``Everybody, the public and the families involved, is entitled
to a resolution of this case,'' Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin
told reporters. She and coprosecutor Roger Gunson insisted the
blitz of publicity did not influence their decision to go forward.
   Buckey's civil attorney, Scott Bernstein, said outside court the
decision was ``outrageous'' and ``a combination of pressure and
politics.''
   The prosecutors could have dismissed the 13 counts after Buckey,
31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, were acquitted Jan.
18 by a jury on 52 other molestation charges.
   Their trial, which took nearly three years, was the longest and
costliest in U.S. history. Superior Court Judge William Pounders
said the facts involved in the remaining 13 counts ``mitigate in
favor of a long second trial.'' He said he hoped the charges could
be ``scoped down'' to shorten the proceedings.
   Pounders, who said he agreed with the decision to go forward
with a new trial, urged that it begin quickly because ``the range
of emotions is very high. ... There are a lot of people still
sitting in agony. We should seek an end to this as soon as
possible.''
   He set a March 9 trial date, but conceded that could be
complicated by a motion filed Wednesday by Buckey's attorney, Danny
Davis, charging Pounders with prejudice against the defense and
asking that he be removed from the case. Pounders said he would
challenge the motion, telling Davis: ``I do not feel I'm biased
against you or your client.''
   The McMartin case has been in the Los Angeles courts for six
years and originally included seven defendants. Charges were
dismissed against five defendants after an 18-month preliminary
hearing. Only Buckey and his mother stood trial. The case cost
taxpayers over $13 million.
   Buckey spent nearly five years in jail before he was released on
$1.5 million bail last February. Buckey was released Wednesday on
his own recognizance pending a new trial.
   Jurors who spent nearly three years hearing the case said the
prosecution failed to prove 52 of the molestation counts. They said
their votes on the deadlocked counts weighed on the side of
acquittal. Some jurors said they believed children were molested
but weren't convinced it happened at the McMartin school.

   A Sudanese judge on Wednesday ordered the
establishment of 18 military tribunals to try civilian cases, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
   The action follows reports of unrest, including threatened
strikes by trade unions, professional syndicates and others who
oppose the military rule of Lt. General Omar Hassan el-Bashir, who
lead a successful military coup June 30.
   In a dispatch from the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, the Egyptian
news agency said the new courts will examine cases ranging from
disobeying authorities to breaking laws concerning prices, alcohol
sale and prostitution.
   It said a decree by the Sudanese head judge, Gallil Aly Lutfy,
also established a court of appeals for sentences issued by the new
military tribunals.
   Abdel-Gallil Adem Hussein, whose name was not preceded by any
military rank and so was presumed to be a civilian, was appointed
head of the appeals court.
   The news agency did not explain why the decision was ordered by
a civilian and not military authorities, what prompted the decision
or give any other details.
   It was not immediately known what happened to Sudan's civilian
judges.
   El-Bashir established special military courts throughout Sudan
shortly after he came to power at head of a 15-man military junta
mainly to try those considered involved in the ``corrupt regime''
of ousted civilian Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi.
   A military court sentenced to death by hanging the head of the
doctors' union for signing a statement calling for a strike. It was
reported that el-Bashir suspended the execution due after
international calls to do so.
   Civilian courts were known to function and deal with charges
mentioned by the new decision.
   A Sudanese was hanged last month for dealing in narcotics. There
are two others on the death row, for dealing in hard currency and
the black market.

<TEXT>
   Long columns of ethnic Albanian
mourners buried three of their dead in Malisevo on Wednesday, their
sadness mixed with fury at riot police they accused of
machine-gunning unarmed townspeople.
   The mourners, many wearing traditional white domed caps, trudged
down muddy paths toward a small Moslem cemetery overlooking the
rolling hills of some of Yugoslavia's best wine country.
   Most of the town's 4,000 inhabitants went to the burial.
   Dozens milled around journalists, jostling each other in their
eagerness to describe these claims of massacre:
   A Soviet-built armored personnel carrier raced through the town
Tuesday morning, its turret rotating wildly, its 14.5mm
anti-aircraft machine gun firing indiscriminately at passers-by.
   Close behind came two police trucks. Policemen in the backs of
the trucks, in flak jackets and helmets, fired AK-47 assault rifles
at people racing for cover.
   A grocer was killed sitting in his store; another man died as he
walked toward the bus stop, and a youth was wounded emerging from
the police station, Ahmed Berisa, a City Council member, said.
   Dried blood stains marked the shooting sites.
   Berisa did not say how the third victim died.
   At least 15 people were wounded in the two minutes of shooting,
and three were not expected to survive, Berisa said.
   An ethnic Albanian policeman pointed toward bullet holes around
the station's entrance, saying he was fortunate to be alive becuse
he had been standing directly behind the boy who was hit.
   ``They wanted to kill us all,'' said merchant Sadri Mazreku,
pointing to the riddled metal grating on his storefront. ``They
even shot at the local police post because the officers there are
ethnic Albanians.''
   Kadri Krasnici, the local Communist Party chief, said a
full-scale massacre in Malisevo, 12 miles west of Kosovo's capital
of Pristina, was ``avoided by sheer luck because only a few people
were on the streets at the time of the attack.''
   Children pointed out more than 100 bullet holes on the walls of
buildings lining the town's main street.
   Metal railings on a bridge over a small stream were split by the
impact of bullets.
   Several people alleged that the attack against Malisevo and
similar ones on two nearby villages, which resulted in no
casualties, were revenge on the part of Serbian police.
   They said that ethnic strains motivated the attacks, aggravated
by a clash with Albanian demonstrators that injured a police
officer.
   Thousands of riot police from Yugoslavia's largest republic of
Serbia have been deployed over the past week in Kosovo to help
control huge demonstrations by ethnic Albanians demanding more
autonomy for the region. The province is administrativaly a part of
Serbia, which exercises pervasive control.
   Serbia accuses ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's 1.9 million people, of harassing the Serbian minority to
drive them out and of wanting to join neighboring Albania.
   Krasnici read a statement to journalists that said a riot police
unit had ``executed an unprovoked armed attack on Malisevo. What
happened here is without precedent in postwar Yugoslavia.
   ``Malisevo and two neighboring villages were attacked by
terrorists and criminals, who cannot remain in the security forces
of Yugoslavia.''
   Krasnici said local authorities had contacted Yugoslav President
Janez Drnovsek to demand an official inquiry.
   The shooting was ``possibly caused by a desire for revenge'' by
a group of Serbian police who earlier clashed with rioters six
miles east of Malisevo, town official Ibis Taci said.
   An officer apparently riding in one of the two trucks was
seriously wounded, Taci added.
   Sgt. Adem Salja, commander of the local police station, said,
``There was no unrest in Malisevo and we had certainly not asked
for any reinforcements.'' On Wednesday, hundreds of youths with
scarves over their faces flashed V-for-victory signs on the main
road linking the town with Pristina. They chanted ``Democracy,
democracy!'' at cars slowing down to get past stone and wood
barricades they erected.
   Harried-looking riot police, clutching automatic rifles and tear
gas grenade launchers, did not interfere.

   Parliament on Wednesday liberalized
media laws and gave citizens the right to operate newspapers and
radio and television stations, the official MTI news agency said.
   The changes amend a 1986 law that will be scrapped altogether
when the Justice Ministry completes work on a new statute.
   Under the previous law, only state bodies and other legal
entities could operate newspapers and broadcast stations.
   The new law says the only requirement for starting a newspaper
is reporting the plan to authorities and requesting resigstration,
according to MTI.
   ``Practicing the freedom of the press cannot lead to the
violation of the law or incitement thereto. Neither can it go
against individual rights,'' the law says.
   It also says public morals and decency should not be violated,
MTI said.
   The law also regulates press violations of individual rights and
allows juries to order a newspaper to pay damages up to $8,300 in
civil cases.
   However, all damages will go into the public treasury, not to
the winner of the case.

<HEAD>Aquino Calls for Halt to Coup Rumors; Bishops Denounce Coup
Attempts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino called
Wednesday for an end to coup rumors, saying they are undermining
the government's efforts to restore stability.
   ``I believe we should stop emphasizing these alleged plots,''
Mrs. Aquino said in a statement Wednesday. ``We will never be able
to accomplish the task of national development if this is all we
are going to highlight every day.''
   Mrs. Aquino made the statement after unconfirmed media reports
that the military went on full alert earlier this week to prevent
an attack on the presidential palace.
   Rumors of a new coup have been sweeping the Philippine capital
since the the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt by thousands of mutinous
troops, the sixth and most serious bid by right-wing military
officers to topple Mrs. Aquino. At least 113 people were killed and
more than 500 wounded in the fighting.
   On Tuesday, American officials and lawmakers said in Washington
the Aquino government still faces the threat of a new coup attempt
and is encumbered by widespread corruption.
   ``The political situation remains unsettled and ... many wonder
whether the government can recover from the blow sufficiently to
restore popular confidence and make lasting strides toward
stability,'' Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Carl W. Ford
told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.
   ``We are hopeful that the near loss of hard-won democracy will
energize the Philippine public and private sectors to work even
more closely and effectively,'' he said.
   During the same hearing, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
David Lambertson said he came back from Manila ``impressed again
with the determination and resilience of the government and its
people.''
   But ``the danger of another coup attempt exists,'' he said.
   He said Mrs. Aquino must regain confidence by eradicating
corruption and improving inefficient government services to avert
another coup attempt.
   ``Corruption remains a real problem in the Philippines and its
corrosive effects hamper government operations,'' he said.
``President Aquino is fully aware of the problem and has made
efforts to deal with it'' both by example and by exhorting her
people.
   Also Wednesday, the country's influential Roman Catholic
hierachy deplored the ``climate of violence'' and warned against
``foreign interests'' seeking to foment unrest.
   The statement by the Catholic Bishops Conference of the
Philippines did not identify ``foreign interests'' but the
declaration followed media speculation that conservative groups in
the United States may be working with Filipino dissidents to topple
Mrs. Aquino.
   In a pastoral letter read over the church-run Radio Veritas by
the conference president, Bishop Leonardo Legazpi, the Catholic
leadership denounced coup attempts as ``immoral'' and ``unjust.''
   The pastoral letter, the first since December's failed coup, was
issued at the end of the two-day annual meeting of the conference,
the highest policy-making church council in this predominantly
Roman Catholic nation. It is to be read during church services
nationwide over the weekend.

<HEAD>AFL-CIO Backs Moynihan's Social Security Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO on Wednesday backed a plan by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan to return Social Security to a
pay-as-you-go basis and take its surplus off the federal budget.
   ``This plan would reduce the tax burden on working men and
women, whose tax share has become disproportionate to that of the
wealthy,'' the federation of 14.1 million union members said in a
statement. ``As it is, the growing Social Security surplus is being
used to mask budget deficits that have been exacerbated by
unbalanced and unwise spending and revenue policies. The Moynihan
proposal has exposed this scam for all to see.''
   The endorsement came hours before President Bush was to attack
the plan in his State of the Union address. He already voiced his
opposition to the idea, which has generated heated debate since
Moynihan, D-N.Y., first announced it in late December.
   Moynihan said he was heartened by the federation's support,
which came after a meeting Wednesday with 20 member union leaders.
   ``The issues are tax fairness for American workers and the
integrity of Social Security,'' he said. ``I am not the least
surprised and (am) most gratified that (federation President) Lane
Kirkland and the AFL-CIO insist on both.''
   Last week, Moynihan introduced a bill to cut the Social Security
tax from the current 6.2 percent to 5.1 percent by next year. This
would cost the Social Security trust fund $55 billion but would
save a working couple up to $600 a year.
   The measure would stop building up a huge trust fund surplus
which Moynihan says is wrongly being used to mask the true size of
the federal deficit.
   The AFL-CIO differed with Moynihan over how much the trust fund
surplus should be allowed to grow before repealing the Social
Security tax increase. The federation believes the surplus should
reach 125 percent to 150 percent of one year's benefits while
Moynihan's legislation would make the cuts when the fund reaches
100 percent.

<HEAD>Thatcher Admits False Statements on Northern Ireland Dirty Tricks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Wednesday
she wrongly denied the existence of a ``dirty tricks'' campaign in
Northern Ireland in the 1970s, but blamed information she received
from civil servants.
   On Tuesday, Armed Forces Minister Archie Hamilton confirmed that
a covert program codenamed ``Clockwork Orange'' had existed to feed
lies to journalists covering the Northern Ireland conflict.
   In 1987, Mrs. Thatcher rejected claims by former army press
officer Colin Wallace that such a program existed.
   Wallace says he was dismissed from the Civil Service in 1975,
four years before Mrs. Thatcher took office, for threatening to
expose the program.
   Mrs. Thatcher's admission was published as the government
promised a statement to the House of Commons on Thursday by Defense
Secretary Tom King. The government has already begun a new inquiry
into Wallace's dismissal.
   Until Tuesday, allegations of disinformation and cover-ups in
Northern Ireland were always denied.
   Wallace says ``Clockwork Orange'' began as an attempt to
discredit the Irish Republican Army through false stories such as
the claim that the guerrillas had Soviet rockets armed with
unstable explosives.
   He alleges that elements within MI5, the military
counterintelligence agency, later took over the program and set out
to smear politicians and prominent Protestants in Northern Ireland.
   The IRA has fought an urban guerrilla war since 1970 to end
British rule in Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it
with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   In a letter to a lawmaker from her Conservative Party, Mrs.
Thatcher said:
   ``I regret to say that a re-examination of departmental papers
has brought to light information which shows that there were a
number of statements in my letters, and in other ministerial
statements and official correspondence, which were incorrect or
require clarification.
   ``Inquiries are being made to establish how these errors in the
handling of departmental papers occurred.
   ``But of course the matters with which they deal originated
under previous administrations, and present ministers can only deal
with them on the basis of information made available to us.''
   Former MI5 agent Peter Wright spoke in his book ``Spycatcher''
of an MI5 plot to undermine Harold Wilson's government. Mrs.
Thatcher's denial of any such plot came in a public debate about
government efforts to suppress Wright's book.
   At the time Wallace was fired, Wilson was prime minister of a
Labor Party government, though Wallace's allegations also involve
the years of Edward Heath's Conservative government of 1970-74.
   Hamilton, the armed forces minister, said no evidence was found
of any plot to discredit politicians, and he said the program had
been terminated.
   ``It has not since the mid-1970s been the policy to disseminate
disinformation in Northern Ireland in ways designed to denigrate
individuals and-or organizations for propaganda purposes. That
remains the case,'' he said.
   Tony Benn, a former Labor Cabinet minister, told Commons Wallace
should testify before a parliamentary committee, free from the
threat of prosecution for discussing state secrets.
   ``For over 20 years disinformation has been issuing from
government ... disinformation now admitted for the first time ever
by the government,'' Benn said.
   ``A Clockwork Orange'' is the title of a novel by Anthony
Burgess, published in 1962, about extreme forms of mind-control in
a totalitarian state. A film based on the book appeared in 1971.

<HEAD>Army Steamrolls 3,500 Weapons Seized from Sinhalese Radicals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops on Wednesday ran a steamroller
over 3,500 weapons, mostly unserviceable shotguns, that they said
were seized from Sinhalese extremists trying to topple the
government.
   The crushed weapons were to be dumped in the sea.
   Three thousand other captured weapons were found to be in
working order and will be put to unspecified use, military
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The government also reported 697 Sinhalese radicals surrendered
in December and January and were taken to rehabilitation centers.
The announcement gave no indication how long they will be held.
   It also said four Sinhalese civilians were killed by the
extremists Tuesday in two attacks in southern Sri Lanka.
   The steamrolling of shotguns and other weapons symbolized the
force the government has employed to halt attacks by the People's
Liberation Front, which has been attacking government officials and
supporters since 1987.
   In December about 8,000 shotguns and rifles were steamrolled in
the first such action.
   At least 6,000 people have been killed in the struggle between
the People's Liberation Front and the government. The front
launched its campaign after July 29, 1987, when the government
signed a peace accord designed to end a Tamil separatist revolt
that has claimed 11,000 lives since 1983.
   Sinhalese control the government and the military and make up 75
percent of the country's population of 16 million.

   A Coast Guard cutter sprayed a Cuban-operated
freighter with machine-gun fire and shells Wednesday when the ship
refused to stop for a drug inspection, but the vessel escaped into
Mexican waters, officials said.
   The 250-foot Hermann took several hits from the cutter
Chincoteague as it was chased for more than 26 hours across the
Gulf of Mexico, said Coast Guard spokesman Joe Gibson.
   Coast Guardsmen saw no evidence of casualties aboard the
freighter, said Jack O'Dell, a Coast Guard spokesman in Washington.
   When the Panama-registered ship reached Mexican waters, the
110-foot Coast Guard cutter held fire and asked the Mexican
government to take over and determine whether the vessel was
carrying drugs, Gibson said.
   ``We were in international waters,'' Gibson said. ``We cannot
pursue vessels into other countries' waters.''
   The Hermann steamed on unaccompanied toward the central Mexican
coast. Later, two Mexican navy vessels escorted the ship to the
port of Tampico, and authorities began searching the vessel, the
Foreign Ministry said. The inspection was expected to take at least
24 hours.
   The official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina reported that the
ship, with a 12-man crew, was carrying 10 tons of the element
chromium and was operated by the Guamar Shipping Co. of Cuba.
   Gibson, however, said the Coast Guard talked to the ship's
master by radio and the captain claimed the vessel had no cargo. He
said the Coast Guard's law enforcement division believes the ship
carried chrome, which can be either chromium or an alloy of the
element.
   An official at the Cuban diplomatic mission in Washington called
the incident a provocation.
   In a report monitored in Mexico City, Prensa Latina quoted
another official as saying, ``This deed demonstrates once more that
the United States intends to behave as owner of the world and with
its proverbial barbarism appears willing to obstruct normal
commerce between Cuba and Mxico.''
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III disagreed.
   ``It was not an attack and a provocation,'' Baker told
reporters. ``We were engaged in a legal law enforcement activity.''
   State Department, Defense Department and National Security
Council officials held three meetings before giving permission to
use disabling fire against the Hermann, said O'Dell.
   The Coast Guard obtained permission from Panama to fire on the
ship, Gibson said. He said it is protocol to request permission to
stop a vessel from its country of registry.
   The Cuban Embassy in Mexico City charged that the Hermann was
attacked in Mexican waters, but that was denied by Mexico's Foreign
Ministry and the U.S. government.
   Prensa Latina said the Hermann's captain, Diego Sanchez, was in
contact with Cuba throughout the incident, and was told not to
allow the Coast Guard to board and to fight until the end.
   ``The occupants of the merchant ship were ready to stop them
with machetes, knives, hatchets and other tools,'' Presna Latina
said.
   The 335-mile chase began at 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, when the
Chincoteague spotted the Hermann about 120 miles north of Merida on
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, said Coast Guard Lt. Steve Koska.
   The Coast Guard decided to check the Hermann because it fit the
profile of a narcotics-smuggling ship, he said, refusing to be
specific.
   The cutter tried repeatedly to stop the freighter peacefully,
Gibson said.
   ``We got on the radio, we asked them to stop, we used a signal
light, we used a blue light, we used a flag hoist, we sprayed water
onto the vessel and we sprayed water down into the stacks,'' he
said.
   ``Nothing worked, so we fired warning shots over the bow,''
Gibson said. ``They continued, and we asked the Panamanian
government for permission to use disabling fire. The Panamanian
government said do it.''
   The Chincoteague opened fire on the Hermann at 5:08 a.m.
Wednesday about 45 miles east of Tampico, Koska said. The ship
entered Mexican waters at 6:43 a.m.
   ``The bottom line is that we weren't able to disable the
vessel,'' Koska said.
   Including warning shots, the cutter fired 130 rounds from a 20mm
gun and 250 to 300 rounds from an M-60 machine gun, Gibson said.
   The Hermann took hits in the engine compartment and the rudder
post, O'Dell said. The ship was belching black smoke and might have
been taking on water.
   The cutter lost sight of the ship, but the Hermann's master was
heard on the radio asking Mexican officials for permission to enter
the Tampico harbor.
   The Chincoteague, based in Mobile, Ala., has a crew of 16, two
M-60 machine guns and one 20mm gun on the forecastle.

   Thousands of queue-hardened Soviets on Wednesday
cheerfully lined up to get a taste of ``gamburgers,''
``chizburgers'' and ``Filay-o-feesh'' sandwiches as McDonald's
opened in the land of Lenin for the first time.
   The world's largest version of the landmark American fast-food
chain rang up 30,000 meals on 27 cash registers, breaking the
opening-day record for McDonald's worldwide, officials said.
   The Soviets, bundled in fur coats and hats, seemed unfazed,
lining up before dawn outside the 700-seat restaurant, the first of
20 planned across the Soviet Union. The crush of customers was so
intense the company stayed open until midnight, two hours later
than planned.
   ``I only waited an hour and I think they served thousands before
me,'' said a happy middle-aged woman who works at an aluminum plant.
   ``And it was only 10 rubles for all this,'' she said. ``I'm
taking it back for the girls at the factory to try.''
   Big Macs were priced at 3.75 rubles and double cheeseburgers at
3 rubles _ about two hours' pay for a starting McDonald's staffer
or the average Soviet, but much cheaper than other private
restaurants that have sprung up recently.
   The official exchange rate is $1.59 per ruble but foreign
visitors can buy rubles for 16 cents each, about what the currency
is worth on the black market.
   Half the day's sales were donated to the Soviet Children's Fund,
which provides medical care and assistance to orphans and
disadvantaged children, Gary Reinblatt, senior vice president of
McDonald's Canada, said from Toronto.
   The restaurant, built by the company in a joint venture with the
city of Moscow that began 14 years ago, brought to 52 the number of
countries where McDonald's operates.
   The previous opening-day record for sales was in Budapest,
company officials said. Besides its restaurants in the United
States, the leading number of McDonald's are in Canada and Japan,
the officials said.
   Soviets got a first-hand look at such alien concepts as
efficiency and fast, friendly service. Normally dour citizens broke
into grins as they caught the infectious cheerful mood from
youthful Soviet staffers hired for their ability to smile and work
hard.
   Accordions played folk songs and women in traditional costumes
danced with cartoon characters, including Mickey Mouse and Baba
Yaga, a witch of Russian fairy tales.
   One Muscovite, accustomed to clerks who snarl if they say
anything at all, asked for a straw and was startled when a smiling
young Soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into his
drink.
   For most customers, it was their first experience with a
hamburger. Sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked with
the golden arches, but were packed in wrappers bearing Cyrillic
letters, approximating ``gamburger.''
   They tried them one-handed. They picked their sandwiches apart
to examine the contents. One young woman finally squashed her
``Beeg Mak'' to fit her lips around it.
   ``It tasted great!'' a 14-year-old boy said.
   ``It's a lot different from a stolovaya,'' he continued with a
smile, referring to the much cheaper but run-down dirty cafeterias
that slop rice and fat or boiled sausage.
   Under the sign of the golden arches, accented by the Soviet
hammer-and-sickle flag, hundreds lined up for the long-awaited
grand opening at 10 a.m. on Pushkin Square, reaching out excitedly
for McDonald's flags and pins as the hamburger chain's army
fulfilled the Soviet penchant for souvenirs with Western logos.
   Publicity-conscious managers had the staff shout ``Good morning,
America!'' in English and Russian, for an American TV network.
   McDonald's of Canada Chairman George Cohon, the man behind the
deal, said many people were buying multiple orders and the
restaurant served 15,000 to 20,000 people in just the first five
hours of operation.
   The restaurant limited purchases to 10 Big Macs per customer in
hopes of preventing burger-scalping.
   McDonald's built its own factory, including bakery, dairy,
meat-processing plant and even potato storage yard, to provide its
own guaranteed supplies in a country where up to 25 percent of the
harvest rots en route to the consumer.
   One McDonald's associate said the company wound up importing
wooden crates from Finland for storing potatoes because ``when they
went to build crates, they found there was no wood, and no nails.
They found you need a permit to buy nails.''

   State lawmakers decided Tuesday not to vote
on a measure to repeal unenforceable criminal penalties for doctors
who perform abortions, but they continued debate on a bill to
require minors to get permission for abortions.
   The Assembly voted 57-39 to keep the repeal bill in the
amendment stage and not bring it to the floor for a final vote, a
move that pro-choice lawmakers said effectively killed the measure.
   ``It's dead,'' Rep. Rebecca Young, a Democrat, said minutes
after the vote. ``This is the end of the bill for this session.''
   The bill would have repealed an outdated state law that provides
criminal penalties, including prison terms, for doctors who perform
abortions. The law has been unenforceable since a 1973 U.S. Supreme
Court ruling legalized abortion nationwide.
   Abortion-rights lawmakers said they want to remove the law from
the books in case the high court should overturn Roe vs. Wade.
Abortion opponents said the law should be kept for the same reason.
   The second bill, backed by abortion opponents, would require
minors to obtain permission from at least one parent or a court
order before having an abortion.
   If the second bill is approved by the Assembly, it would require
approval by the Senate and Gov. Tommy G. Thompson before becoming
law.
   Rep. David Clarenbach, a pro-choice Democrat, said he had
expected the repeal bill to be set back Tuesday, but predicted it
would pass some day.
   ``This Legislature is in the process of becoming pro-choice,''
he said. ``Today, many of you are risking your political careers by
failing to take a pro-choice stand.''
   Assembly Speaker Thomas Loftus, also a Democrat, said the repeal
measure is not dead and could be brought up again later this week
if two-thirds of the Assembly voted to do so.
   ``You have to live with these votes for the rest of your
political life,'' Loftus had said earlier.
   Before deciding not to vote on the repeal bill, the Assembly
rejected an amendment by Democratic Rep. Thomas Seery to alter the
measure so that doctors who performed abortions and women who
obtained abortions after the 18th week of pregnancy could still
face criminal penalties.
   ``What I'm trying to do is find a middle ground,'' Seery said.
``What I'm trying to do is determine when life begins.''
   Lawmakers scrambled Tuesday before the floor session began to
introduce amendments to the second bill, which would require minors
to get permission before having an abortion.
   Some of the estimated 21 amendments hadn't even been drafted
shortly before the 99-member Assembly began debate Tuesday
afternoon. By 9 p.m., the Assembly had acted only two of the
amendments, increasing chances that the session would go into
Wednesday.
   The proposals include provisions to require teen-agers to obtain
the consent of one parent before carrying a child to full term and
to require parents of teen-age mothers to support their
grandchildren.
   Democrats control the Assembly 55-42, but Republican Rep. Robert
Welch had said partisan affiliation would have little effect
because there are more anti-abortion Democrats in the Assembly than
pro-choice Republicans.
   Welch also disagreed with Loftus that the lawmakers' votes on
the two bills would make or break their careers.
   ``I don't think there's a single person in the state Assembly
who will get defeated because of the abortion issue, no matter what
their stand is,'' Welch said.

   If Communists had a heaven, it might look
like Bologna.
   Orange buses glide through a huge historic district closed to
other traffic. Senior citizens take government-subsidized vacations
on the Riviera. Half the city's youngsters attend low-cost day-care
centers.
   ``The Red Disneyland,'' as the Italian press calls it, has long
been considered the showcase of communism Italian-style. So when
the government recently suggested turning city services over to
private enterprise, it left many Italians in shock.
   ``The proposal coming from Bologna is, in some measure,
revolutionary,'' columnist Miriam Mafai wrote in the national
newspaper La Repubblica.
   ``All previous ideas are being erased from the slate, not only
for the Italian Communist Party, but for all the left.''
   The proposal put forth for the northern Italian city is
considered symbolic of the new directions being pursued by the
Italy's national Communist Party, the largest in the West, as it
seeks to overcome an electoral decline and the specter of Communist
failure in Eastern Europe.
   ``I don't want to be reduced to a souvenir of a past era,'' said
Bologna's 45-year-old mayor, Renzo Imbeni, an energetic Marxist
with a bushy black mustache.
   ``I want to be here when the history of tomorrow is written. The
change stems from this need.''
   With a population of 417,000, Bologna is the biggest city in the
Italian ``Red Belt,'' a communist-governed region that has become
one of the country's wealthiest areas.
   After World War II, when voters turned to the party that helped
lead the anti-fascist resistance, Bologna became Italy's first
large city to elect a communist administration.
   It earned national fame for its ``do-it-all governments'' which
set up pharmacies in poor neighborhoods, paid the rent for
low-income elderly citizens and offered free bus transportation
during rush hours.
   When buildings decayed in the portico-lined historic district,
the government spent millions of dollars to restore them _ then
moved the working-class residents back in.
   To help women work, it set up a day-care system that even today
charges the equivalent of only $65 to $150 a month for children up
to 5.
   ``There is a rather high level of social protection,'' Mayor
Imbeni said in an interview in the Communal Palace, a 15th-century
building surrounded by bulletin boards featuring the communist
daily newspaper, L'Unita.
   ``But it's not written anywhere that we will be able to
guarantee this also in the future.''
   He noted that the welfare-state system had deteriorated in many
countries due to stagnant revenues, an increase in the number of
needy and a shrinking pool of young people _ all problems in
Bologna.
   ``Because of this, the choice was made ... for a requalification
and a renewal of the welfare state we have locally,'' Imbeni said.
   What Bologna is proposing to do is sell off its slaughterhouse
and 21 city pharmacies and transfer such services as the cleaning
of schools, provision of student lunches and street maintenance to
a mixed public-private concern. It also is discussing private
management of the hundreds of city-owned offices and apartments.
   The money saved would be devoted to priority areas such as the
increasing number of elderly and Third World immigrants and the
environment.
   The plan has won praise from business executives, average
citizens and the national Communist Party, which is Italy's
second-biggest party. The main critics are rival political parties,
which charge the project is merely a maneuver to win votes in
municipal elections this coming May.
   ``If it's real and concrete, this is an interesting, stunning
new initiative _ an initiative that will be taken as an example by
other city governments,'' said Gianandrea Rocco di Torrepadula,
head of the local Industrialists Association.
   ``In comparison to other cities, this one is run OK,'' said
Marco Bassi, 46, who owns a newsstand in the working-class Little
Bologna neighborhood. ``But things always go better in the private
sector.''
   Imbeni insists that the communists are not doing an about-face.
   ``People say the concept of state ownership is part of the
communist culture,'' he said. ``But for the communists of Bologna,
this isn't true. And for the Italian communists, that was years
ago.''
   Indeed, Bologna and the rest of the ``Red Belt'' are known for
their citizens' entrepreneurial spirit, illustrated by the network
of cooperatives _ most linked to the communists _ which do
everything from producing Parmesan cheese to running restaurants.
   The national Communist Party is hailing the Bologna plan an
example of its own ``new course.'' The party has long embraced
parliamentary democracy but has been kept out of the government for
four decades.
   In line with its new program, the party has called an
extraordinary congress for March to decide whether to become a new
leftist umbrella group _ and perhaps even drop the communist name
and hammer-and-sickle symbol.
   While the Bologna proposal was described as a ``revolution'' in
national newspapers, it will leave many city services intact.
   The government refuses to privatize the day-care system and the
vast bus network, although it has abolished the free rush-hour
rides.
   The low-income elderly will still have a taxi service, domestic
helpers, 32 social centers and subsidized vacations on the Italian
Riviera.
   The government will also continue to provide low-cost study
vacations for teens in England and on the French Riviera.
   ``We don't want to change because there's a black spot on the
soul of our past,'' Imbeni said. ``We must change because we want
to be here in the year 2000 ... with the name we have today or
another. I want to be here.''

<HEAD>ADA Attacks Study on Fluoridation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Dental Association scoffed at a
recent study that found highly fluoridated water caused a rare form
of bone cancer in some rats and reaffirmed its support of the
anti-cavity treatment.
   ``It is totally inappropriate to draw any conclusions from this
single study or to suggest that it is applicable to human beings,''
said Dr. Enid Neidle, director of scientific affairs for the ADA.
   One rat among a group of 50 developed bone cancer after
consuming fluoridated water in a concentration of 45 parts per
million over two years, according to preliminary data from a study
conducted by the National Toxicology Program.
   Four rats in another group developed the cancer after drinking
fluoridated water with a concentration of 79 parts per million over
the same period, the study found.
   But the Chicago-based ADA said Tuesday the public should not
fear sodium fluoride because humans ingest much smaller amounts of
the chemical.
   The average person drinks about eight glasses of water a day,
the ADA said in a press release. A person would have to drink 380
glasses each day to obtain the same concentration of fluoride as
that in the first group of rats, and about 700 glasses a day to
obtain the same concentration of fluoride as that in the second
group of rats, the association said.
   Fluoride, a natural chemical that appears in some waterways, has
remained a controversial issue for many American communities since
1945, when it was artificially introduced into the public water
supply in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Newburgh, N.Y.
   People who favor fluoridation as the best way to prevent tooth
decay say it prevents about two-thirds of all cavities and is
almost completely safe.
   Those who oppose the fluoridation process say the treated water
stains teeth, could harm bones and may cause certain forms of
cancer.
   Public water systems in the United States last year served about
213 million people, but only 61 percent of them drink fluoridated
water. In 1989, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Ore., and San
Antonio still were without fluoridated water, according to the
National Institute of Dental Research.
   Many other local and state governments require fluoridation by
law.

<HEAD>Judge Determines Coleman Can Take Care of Himself</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Gary Coleman scored a victory over his
mother Wednesday when a judge ruled the 21-year-old former
``Diff'rent Strokes'' star was mentally capable of handling his $7
million in holdings by himself.
   ``The very things you claim he doesn't have, he's got,''
Superior Court Judge Martha Goldin told an attorney for Coleman's
mother, who had asked that a court conservator take over the
diminutive actor's finances.
   Edmonia Sue Coleman contended her son was unable to make his own
decisions rationally because of the effects of kidney disease and
the influence of a close friend and adviser who lives with him in
Denver.
   Coleman said at a court hearing earlier this month that his
mother's effort for conservatorship was an ``attempt to control my
life.''
   Coleman, who played the precocious Arnold Jackson on the hit TV
show, filed a lawsuit that alleges his parents and former business
manager mishandled his money and funneled away more than $1 million
for themselves. The lawsuit has yet to come to trial.
   Goldin said she relied on findings in a court-ordered report
detailing Coleman's condition in ruling against ordering a
conservatorship hearing. The judge sealed the report.
   Coleman declined to comment. His attorney, Charles Wake, said
the actor was pleased.
   ``It was an emotional experience for him,'' said Wake.
   Coleman's mother said she remains concerned about her son and
continues to feel he is getting poor advice from his friend and
former chauffeur, Dion Mial.
   ``Gary is my son and I love him very much, regardless of what
Mr. Wake says,'' said Mrs. Coleman. ``And what I have done has been
in Gary's best interest.''
   Coleman was born with an atrophied right kidney and lost the
other one when he was 5. He underwent transplants in 1973 and 1984,
both of which failed. He took immunosuppressive drugs for his
condition and they stunted his growth at 4 feet, 8 inches.

<TEXT>
   Diplomats from Israel and East
Germany concluded preliminary talks Wednesday on establishing
formal relations and settling the issue of moral responsibility for
the murder of 6 million Jews in the Nazi Holocaust.
   Talks were adjourned after three days, but both sides said they
would resume later.
   The Israeli delegation said the central issue was the question
of East Germany's accepting ``its share in the moral and historical
responsibility for crimes perpetrated by Germans against Jews
during the Nazi regime.''
   West Germany has acknowledged guilt of the German people and has
paid $47 billion in indemnities to Holocaust victims and their
families.
   Previous Stalinist governments in East Germany denied any
responsibility for the Holocaust, arguing that the Communists
represented the anti-Nazi resistance and bore no blame.
   East German chief delegate Reinar Neumann, chief of the Foreign
Ministry's Middle East desk, indicated the new, reform-minded
government would review its position.
   Prime Minister Hans Modrow said last week East Germany was
willing to discuss the question of reparations, and sought
relations with all nations.
   The Israeli statement said Israel wanted ties with all countries
regardless of ideology. ``Relations with Germany, however, present
Israel with difficulties, as could be appreciated by everyone
familiar with 20th century history.''
   Israel said East Germany asked for the talks. Michael Shiloh,
the Foreign Ministry's adviser on Jewish diaspora affairs, led
Israel's delegation.
   Israel and West Germany established diplomatic relations in 1965.
   The Jewish state and East Germany have never had diplomatic
relations.
   It was not clear if either side raised the parallel issue of
fears voiced by Israeli officials over possible reunification of
East and West Germany.
   A newspaper in Munich reported Wednesday that West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was ``infuriated'' by Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's reservations. The two leaders have had ``a sharp
exchange of letters,'' the paper Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported.

<TEXT>
   A 7-year-old boy told a police dispatcher that his
mother stabbed his two sisters to death and then forced his brother
to kill her, according to a wrenching police tape of the
conversation.
   The triple slaying occurred one day last October while the
children's father, Christopher King, was at work. King has since
reached an agreement with the state child welfare agency to begin
intensive counseling before pursuing custody of his two surviving
sons.
   The call began with David King telling the Metro-Dade police
dispatcher, ``My mommy killed my sisters. ... Then mommy said to
kill her back. ... Then Junior did. Now Junior's crying. Junior's
crying.''
   The dispatcher asked, ``Is your mother still breathing?''
   David said, ``No, I don't see her breathing.''
   Pursuing the same question, the dispatcher asked, ``Is she still
living?''
   David said he thought so, then ordered his 8-year-old brother,
Christopher King Jr., ``Junior, go see if mommy breathing.''
   The caller came back on the line to say, ``My mommy ain't
breathing.''
   Christopher Jr. already had called his father to tell him about
the bloody scene, and King called police for help saying, ``My son
just called me and told everybody at home is dead.''
   Police arrived along with King to find the bodies of Marie King
and her daughters, 4-year-old Grace and 3-year-old Sarah. Autopsies
showed each had been stabbed more than 20 times.
   The tape was released Tuesday by the Dade County State
Attorney's office.

   The former head of the Mexican Federal
Judicial Police and four others were indicted by a federal grand
jury Wednesday on charges of participating in the murder of U.S.
drug agent Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   Manuel Ibarra Herrera was among five defendants named in the
indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, the
Justice Department said.
   Also indicted was Miguel Aldana Ibarra, the former head of the
Mexican branch of Interpol, the international law enforcement
agency, and Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, whose extradition to the
United States sparked deadly riots in Honduras in 1988.
   The five were among 19 people named in a superseding indictment
Wednesday that updates charges related to the February 1985 torture
murder of Camarena and his Mexican pilot and the killings of two
U.S. citizens in Guadalajara.
   The indictment charged that Ibarra Herrera, Aldana Ibarra and
Matta Ballesteros participated in the killing to protect the
operations of the Guadalajara cocaine and marijuana cartel,
according to a Justice Department news release.
   Others were indicted on charges of kidnapping and drug
trafficking.
   If convicted, the defendants could receive life sentences.
   Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were killed after
the agent led a series of raids on marijuana plantations allegedly
operated by Rafael Caro Quintero, who allegedly ran the drug ring.
   Camarena's body was found March 5, 1985, on a ranch 65 miles
southeast of Guadalajara. The Drug Enforcement Administration has
vowed that it will prosecute all connected to the case.
   Aldana Ibarra was quoted extensively in Mexican newspapers in
January as saying that Camarena was alive and living in La Jolla,
Calif. His comments came after NBC-TV aired ``Drug Wars,'' a
three-part movie focusing on Camarena's killing.
   Matta was sentenced Jan. 16 in Los Angeles to life in prison
without possibility of parole following his conviction of
conspiracy, possession, distribution of narcotics and running a
criminal enterprise.
   The charges stemmed from a cocaine ring Matta ran that
distributed the drug in Los Angeles.
   Matta's forced extradition to the United States in April 1988
sparked riots that left five dead in Honduras and torched the U.S.
Embassy annex there.
   Also charged with participating in the Camarena slaying were
Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo and a Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain.
   Considered one of Mexico's biggest drug lords, Felix Gallardo's
arrest in April 1989 on drug trafficking charges was considered a
sign by U.S. officials that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was
serious about cracking down on drug trafficking.
   Ibarra Herrera headed a law enforcement agency that is the
equivalent of the FBI in the United States. He and Aldana Ibarra
are among 15 defendants named in the indictment who are not in U.S.
custody.
   Killed with Camarena was Alfredo Zavala Avelar, a pilot who
assisted the DEA in Mexico. The Justice Department release did not
specify who was accused in his slaying, although the killing was a
subject of the indictment.
   Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo were sentenced in
December to 40 years in prison without parole for their role in
Camarena's slaying.
   Ten other men already have been prosecuted and sentenced in
Mexico for the killings.
   U.S. officials have said they believed that some higher-level
Mexican authorities were involved in protecting the drug
traffickers and covering-up the crime.
   ``We want the message to be clear that anyone who kills one of
our agents will be hunted down and brought to justice by the DEA,''
said Ralph Lochridge, DEA spokesman in Los Angeles. Lochridge said
a DEA task force based in Los Angeles was investigating the alleged
role of others in the slaying. He declined to identify them.
   The indictment also charges Antonio Vasquez Ochoa with two
counts of committing violent crimes in aid of racketeering in
connection with the Jan. 30, 1985, killings of Americans John
Walker and Alberto Radelat, who were living in Guadalajara.
   The indictment charges the killings were carried out by Vasquez
Ochoa and others to protect the operation of the Guadalajara-based
cartel.
   Already in custody are Ruben Zuno Arce, who was arrested Dec. 9;
Javier Vasquez Velasco, arrested Oct. 12; and Juan Jose Bernabe
Ramirez, arrested July 27.
   Zuno Arce, the brother-in-law of former Mexican President Luis
Echeverria, faces federal charges of conspiracy, kidnapping and
violence in aid of racketeering in connection with Camarena's
slaying.
   Bernabe Ramirez also is charged with conspiracy to kidnap a
federal agent and is in custody.
   Vasquez Velasco is charged with two counts of committing violent
crimes in aid of racketeering in connection with the murders of
Walker and Radelat.

   The environmental ministers of the
Soviet Union's three Baltic republics said Wednesday their regions
have been seriously polluted and they need help from the West in
cleanup efforts.
   Indulis Emsis of Latvia said the port of Ventspils, for example,
is a ``gigantic powder keg'' because of the large quantities of
chemicals and minerals dumped into the sea.
   ``An accident there would threaten inhabitants and neighboring
countries,'' he said.
   The ministers of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were in Stockholm
on a five-day official visit they hope will lead to cooperation in
environmental research and cleanup projects.
   The Swedish government has pledged $160 million to help the
republics.
   ``We are intent on helping, as a gesture of solidarity, but also
because it benefits Sweden,'' said Environment Minister Birgitta
Dahl.
   The Baltic officials said their new leaders have broken with the
past and made environmental issues a top priority.
   Estonia's Tiit Nuudi said his republic was creating a system of
fees for consumers of natural resources and fines for polluting
activities.

   Given the chance, 65 percent of high school
students would cheat on an important exam, according to a national
survey released Wednesday that questioned American children on
their beliefs and moral values.
   The survey also showed that 37 percent of junior and senior high
school students interviewed said they would have sex with someone
they love.
   The survey interviewed 5,012 students in grades 4-12 from 233
public, private and parochial schools from Sept. 14 to Oct. 30.
   Among its other findings:
   _ When asked how they would advise a pregnant friend, only 12
percent of respondents said they would tell her to have an
abortion, while 57 percent advised having the baby. Black and
Hispanic children were significantly more likely to recommend
having and keeping the baby over abortion or adoption.
   Seventy percent of students surveyed said a pregnant girl should
have the final say on having an abortion; 13 percent gave that say
to the parents.
   _ Among their major concerns, respondents most often (24
percent) listed pressure to do well in school or sports, followed
by what to do with their lives (17 percent), drug use (13 percent),
lack of close friends (8 percent) and teen-age pregnancy (6
percent).
   As for the pressures they feel a lot, obeying parents and
teachers led the list (80 percent), followed by the pressure to get
good grades (78 percent), not to take drugs (77 percent), to
prepare for the future (69 percent) and to earn money (62 percent).
Just 6 percent named the pressure to take drugs.
   _ Nearly half of those surveyed (45 percent) said they rely on
their own personal experience when deciding what is true, compared
to just 3 percent who believe science is the most believable
authority in such matters.
   The survey was conducted for the Girl Scouts of the United
States of America in partnership with the Lilly Endowment and the
C.S. Mott Foundation. It was done by Harris-Scholastic Research, a
division of the Louis Harris and Associates Inc. polling firm, in
collaboration with Harvard child psychiatrist Robert Coles,
sociologist James Davison Hunter of the University of Virginia and
John Seel of the Williamsburg Charter Foundation.

<TEXT>
   Much of Prince William Sound remains
polluted from the nation's worst oil spill, and the cleanup must
resume when the weather improves this spring, Gov. Steve Cowper
said Wednesday.
   About 117 miles of shore throughout the sound remain oiled from
the Exxon Valdez spill, including 85 heavily oiled areas, according
to a state survey released by Cowper. While much of the surface oil
is gone, in 224 locations oil was found up to 28 inches deep in the
rocky beaches, he said.
   ``The evidence is that the problem will not go away by the end
of this winter, and that we are going to have to return to the
beaches of coastal Alaska to clean up this mess,'' Cowper told a
news conference.
   He also called on Congress to pass pending legislation that
would require oil tankers using U.S. ports to have double hulls and
double bottoms within several years.
   Nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude gushed from the
Valdez after it ran aground March 24.
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation surveyed the
shores in October and November after Exxon Corp. halted its cleanup
due to severe winter weather. The data took some time to assemble,
state officials said, and the survey was not completed until last
week.
   The news conference came as jury selection was under way in
Anchorage in the criminal trial of Joseph Hazelwood, former captain
of the Exxon Valdez. Cowper spokesman David Ramseur said reporters
covering the trial were invited to take part in the news conference
by telephone.
   Exxon officials did not dispute the survey's findings, but said
nature has removed oil from many shores since the information was
collected last fall.
   ``We know that in the high-energy areas that the winter storms
are having a dramatic effect,'' said Don Carpenter, Exxon's
operations and logistics manager in Anchorage. ``The 32 miles in
the sheltered areas we have more concern about, but there's
evidence that the effect of nature's forces is dramatic there,
too.''
   But recent spot checks found continued heavy oil accumulations,
Cowper said, showing reporters a two-minute video with scenes of
oiled beaches shot in the past three days. The scenes confirm the
fall survey's results, he said.
   ``The reason why we are presenting this beach survey is not to
criticize the efforts that have been made so far,'' he said. ``The
point is to show the amount of work that has to be done as soon as
the weather clears.''
   Exxon and several government agencies will put together a spring
cleanup plan after another survey is conducted in April. Exxon
spokesman Perry Smith said a determination of what cleanup
measures, if any, are needed will be made by May.
   Cowper said his administration decided to support the proposed
requirement for double-bottomed, double-hulled tankers despite the
estimated $10 million a year it would cost the state in reduced oil
revenues.
   The industry's cost of upgrading the Alaska tanker fleet is a
transportation expense that would be deducted from the wellhead
price of Alaska oil, on which the state bases its taxes and
royalties.
   ``We think that it's worth it,'' Cowper said.
   The tankers used in the Alaska trade are aging and will have to
replaced eventually anyway, he said.
   A Coast Guard study estimated the Exxon Valdez would have
released about 60 percent less oil if it had a double bottom.

   A guerrilla war has destroyed nearly
one-third of the country's primary schools, the Mozambican news
agency reported Wednesday.
   The news agency AIM said Fatima Carrilho, a senior Ministry of
Education official, told a conference 32 percent of the 5,709
primary schools that existed in 1981 had been decimated by fighting.
   Ms. Carrilho said the poor southern African nation was facing an
education crisis with just half the schools offering a full
five-year primary education, the report said. The nation's schools
only had enough room for 40 percent of children of school age, it
said.
   The government lacks the money to build schools and improve
education, with just 225 new classrooms being constructed in 1989,
the report said.
   The leftist government of the former Portugese colony is
fighting a 13-year-old insurgency by the Mozambique National
Resistance. The war has devastated large areas of the country, with
the death toll estimated at up to 500,000.

   Snow blanketed much of Japan and South Korea on
Thursday, snarling transportation and leaving more than two dozen
people dead and hundreds injured this week, officials said.
   Tokyo, a city unused to anything more than a dusting of snow,
woke up to find nearly 3 inches on the ground and more falling. By
dawn, more than 3 inches had fallen in adjacent Yokohama and 7{
inches in Mito, 63 miles northeast of Tokyo, the Meteorological
Agency said.
   In South Korea about 10 inches of snow fell by early Thursday in
Seoul, the capital city of 10 million people.
   Police reported hundreds of casualties in snow-related traffic
accidents, including 27 deaths on Tuesday when snow began piling
up. Damage was estimated at $6 million nationwide.
   Villages along the east coast and nearby mountains were hit
hardest with up to 5 feet of snow since Tuesday afternoon.
   The international airport at Narita, 35 miles northeast of
Tokyo, was closed at 8:00 a.m. for snow removal but was scheduled
to reopen about an hour later.
   At Tokyo's Haneda airport, 43 domestic flights were canceled due
to snow, affecting 5,000 passengers, Kyodo News Service reported.
   Another domestic airport at Sendai, in northwestern Japan, was
also closed due to snow, Kyodo said.
   In Tokyo, 18 people were slightly injured after they fell on
slippery roads or were involved in snow-related traffic accidents,
said Sabuto Nakane, a spokesman for the Tokyo Fire Department.
There were no reports of deaths or injuries elsewhere.
   Meanwhile, the bullet trains were running at a reduced 106 mph
due to snow, railway officials said. The intercity trains usually
run at 130 mph.
   About 40,000 government officials and police were ordered out
Thursday to clear Korean streets of snow and open traffic to
isolated villages after forecasters lifted snow warnings, officials
said.

   President Bush, acclaiming the ``revolution of
'89'' in Eastern Europe, proposed a sharp new cut in U.S. and
Soviet combat forces Wednesday night and told a joint meeting of
Congress that ``the time is right to move forward'' in Europe.
   In his first State of the Union address, Bush also announced
plans to withdraw _ ``well before the end of February'' _ the last
3,000 troops from a force of 14,000 sent to Panama to oust Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Democrats and Republicans alike, assembled in joint session of
Congress to hear the president, stood in ovation when Bush said,
``One year ago, the people of Panama lived in fear, under the thumb
of a dictator. Today, democracy is restored, Panama is free.''
   Hours before he delivered his address, Bush telephoned Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to advise him of his proposal to cut
U.S. and Soviet forces in Central Europe to 195,000 on each side.
Later Bush charcterized Gorbachev as ``receptive'' and willing to
consider the proposal.
   The cuts would be nowhere near equal since the Soviets have a
huge advantage in European military force. The United States has
305,000 troops in Europe, compared to 565,000 Soviet forces.
   Last May, Bush proposed a 275,000-troop ceiling and he had said
he would not seek deeper cuts until U.S.-Soviet negotiators had
finalized that agreement. Wednesday, the administration said it
wanted parallel discussions on the deeper cuts. Why the shift? A
senior U.S. official said, ``Events (in Europe) were running ahead
of the negotiations.''
   The European troop offer was the surprising _ and popular _
centerpiece of a speech in which Bush also proposed lofty goals for
American schools and prodded lawmakers to approve his plans for a
capital gains tax cut and bills dealing with clean air, child care,
crime and drugs.
   In reaction, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley embraced the troop
reduction plan but said Democrats would offer a domestic agenda of
their own.
   With ambassadors from across the world in attendance, Bush said,
``With communism crumbling, our aim must be to ensure Democracy's
advance ... We are in a period of great transition, great hope, yet
great uncertainty.''
   Bush said, ``The events of the year just ended _ the revolution
of '89 _ have been a chain reaction, change so striking that it
marks the beginning of a new era in the world's affairs.
   ``Think back,'' Bush asked Congress and his national broadcast
audience, ``to the world we knew as 1989 began.'' In the year
since, Communist governments gave way in Poland, East Germany,
Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. In such locations, Bush said,
``the idea called America is alive.''
   On his return to the White House, Bush was asked by reporters
how Gorbachev reacted.
   ``I can't characterize it, but I can just simply say that he was
receptive, but I don't know whether he's supportive or not. I just
told him about it and so we have to wait,'' Bush said. ``You can't
_ something as complicated as that and serious, obviously they need
to consider it. So that's about all. But it was a friendly and I
think productive conversation.''
   In his speech, Bush said: ``We recognize that the Soviet
military threat in Europe is diminishing but we see little change
in Soviet strategic modernization. ... But the time is right to
move forward on a conventional arms-control agreement to move us to
more appropriate levels of military forces in Europe.''
   His troop cutback proposal won immediate praise from Congress.
Sen. Sam Nunn, Democratic chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said it fit ``the changing circumstances in Europe and the fiscal
pressures'' at home.
   ``It's time to act together,'' Bush said in a speech intended to
help set an election-year agenda for a Democratic-run Congress.
Even so, partisanship was clear when Bush extolled his ``no new
taxes'' budget plan. Republicans erupted with applause. Democrats
didn't.
   Bush was welcomed warmly as he entered the packed chamber, where
congressional aides stood three deep around the walls and
spectators filled even the aisle stairs in the visitors' galleries.
A cheer went up as Foley, D-Wash., introduced the president as
``our former colleague.''
   Barbara Bush stood in the balcony with hands clasped in front of
her during the 2{-minute welcoming ovation. Nearby sat Marilyn
Quayle and next to her, evangelist Billy Graham. In all, there were
35 interruptions for applause.
   Foley agreed with much of what Bush said, but said that on some
points, Democrats disagree. Foley said Bush cannot become the
``education president,'' if his budget for fiscal 1991 includes
only a 2 percent increase in spending for education.
   The speaker also said Democrats will fight the administration on
child care, clean air legislation, capital gains and the issue of
abortion.
   In his speech, the president condemned racially motivated mail
bombings, saying the nation ``must confront and condemn racisim,
anti-semitism, bigotry and hate.'' And he said, ``Our hearts go out
to our hostages -- our hostages who are ceaselessly on our minds
and in our efforts.''
   ``... And let me say that so long as we remember the American
idea _ so long as we live up to the American ideal _ the State of
the union will remain sound and strong,'' he said.
   Confronting a sensitive issue, Bush brushed off a proposal by
Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., to roll back a Social Security tax
increase.
   ``The last thing we need to do is mess around with Social
Security,'' Bush said. Republicans rose in applause, followed by
Democrats, including a broadly-grinning Moynihan.

   Large-scale U.S. troop cuts in Europe at the
level President Bush discussed with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev Wednesday would deal an economic blow to West Germany.
   Bush proposed that U.S. and Soviet troops be reduced to 195,000,
officials in Washington said, and he was to announce the plan
formally in his State of the Union address before a joint session
of Congress Wednesday night.
   Bush's proposal was described by the officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, as a result of the collapse of hard-line
communist governments in Eastern Europe.
   The plan would cover more than 265,000 U.S. troops in Western
Europe and 565,000 Soviet forces in Central and Eastern Europe.
   About 250,000 U.S. servicemen are based in West Germany alone.
   There was no immediate reaction from West German officials to
Bush's plan.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Rainer Mueller said in Bonn that
details of the Bush proposal were not yet available, and that they
would have to be studied by high-level officials before any comment
could be made on the plan.
   Late-night television newscasts reported briefly, without
comment, that Bush was expected to call for deeper troop cuts.
   The Cologne-based German Economics Institute reported in a July
study that West Germany earns $5 billion a year from U.S. military
expenditures. It warned that a troop pullout would mean ``economic
collapse'' for regions that are heavily dependent on the American
presence.
   An extensive analysis of the U.S. bases was undertaken because
of the growing public tendency to see American troops as a burden,
institute director for economic and scientific affairs Otto Vogel
said at the time.
   There has been increasing support in recent months for troop
cuts as a way to reduce tensions in Europe and move the German
states closer to reunification now that the Communists in East
Germany no longer have a monopoly on power.
   East Germany is the Kremlin's most critical military ally, and
about 400,000 Soviet troops are stationed in the country.
   The Kremlin does not want to lose its front-line bases in East
Germany, but it has indicated it could accept a neutral state.
   West Germany is under pressure to remain in NATO and keep troops
as part of its commitment to the Western defense alliance. The
troops, however, are an obstacle to reunification.
   Last May, Bush proposed a 275,000 ceiling on U.S. and on Soviet
forces and said negotiations to reach that goal should be wrapped
up within a year.
   Before now, Bush has said he would not support further cuts
until the current talks were wrapped up. But, a senior
administration official said, ``Events were running ahead of the
negotiations.''
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said on
Wednesday that a reunited Germany could stay loyal to NATO without
drawing the territory now comprising a crucial Moscow ally into the
Western military alliance.
   Genscher outlined in a speech to the Evangelical Institute in
Tutzing, near Munich, what he sees as a security guarantee for
Moscow and a compromise that could also assuage the United States.
   The foreign minister suggested that the territory now
constituting West Germany could remain in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, while the area east of the Elbe River, East Germany,
would not contain military facilities.
   U.S. and West European allies have indicated they would accept
reunification as long as Germany stays within NATO.

   President Bush, trying to forge an
election-year agenda for a Democratic-run Congress, presents a
State of the Union address tonight offering an upbeat picture of
the nation's health while prodding lawmakers to approve legislation
they ignored last year.
   Bush also will issue a challenge to make American students first

they have ranked near the bottom in international testing,
officials said Tuesday.
   Bush will address a joint session of Congress in a nationally

the Union address, although he went before Congress with a budget
and deficit-reduction package last February.
   At the top of Bush's wish list for lawmakers are leftover bills
dealing with clean air, crime, child care and cuts in capital gains
tax rates.

   Ricardo ``Ricky'' Bordallo, 63, shot himself in the head. In
addition to being wrapped in the flag, he had set up four placards,
one of which said: ``I regret that I only have one life to give to
my island,'' according to police and witnesses.
   Bordallo shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol after chaining
himself to a statue of Chief Quipuha, who was the first chief in

   Diary entries by former President Reagan
contain ``information of significance'' for John Poindexter's
Iran-Contra trial, a federal judge says in ordering the excerpts
turned over to the defense.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene on Tuesday ordered the
former president to provide diary excerpts from more than 29
different dates by next Monday, but said he will conduct a lengthy
review process if Reagan invokes executive privilege.
   Such a step could delay the scheduled Feb. 20 start of the
trial, which already has been moved back a month due partly to
Poindexter's efforts to subpoena documents and testimony from
Reagan.
   Reagan, in Las Vegas for a speech Tuesday night, told reporters

   The resignation of Peter A. Cohen as head of the
nation's second-largest brokerage capped a career that exemplified
Wall Street's no-holds-barred expansion in the 1980s as well as its
recent decline.
   Cohen stepped down under fire Tuesday as chairman and chief
executive officer of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which had grown
under his leadership from a medium-size retail brokerage into one
of the nation's most powerful investment houses.
   The resignation derailed at least temporarily Shearson's plan to
raise capital to shore up its balance sheet and preserve its solid
credit standing.
   Cohen's departure also culminated a shakeup of senior management
in recent months brought on by the tough times facing the

   Protestant, Jewish and Roman Catholic leaders
at an interreligious convocation urged more joint theological and
community efforts to end what they called the ``cold war'' among
religions.
   ``The creation of a world at peace is one of the foundation
stones of both Judaism and Christianity,'' but their ``cold war''
undermines credibility of that message, said Rabbi A. James Rudin,

   The Rev. John B. Cobb Jr., a United Methodist theologian of
Claremont University, said a step toward ending the ``war'' was to
bring out ``new overlaps among our faiths'' to inform public life
and public schools.
   He said American society ``has not faced up to the difficulty of
transmitting values apart from schools whose ethos is formed by
particular religious tradtions. What is needed is open interaction
from which would emerge agreements on values that all can support.''
   He urged ``rethinking of our theology so that the most
wholehearted commitment to Christ will be the strongest reason for
the full acceptance of Judaism as a companion in the service of
God.''

<HEAD>Interfaith TV Network Doubles Size In First Year</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American churches, which largely lost their free
public-service television outlets on networks when broadcasting was
deregulated, now have a fast-growing network of their own.
   They had been virtually silenced in that powerful medium as
national channels began selling time to money-soliciting
``televangelists,'' some of whose lapses tainted religion itself.
   But the major faith groups, Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern
Orthodox, Jewish and Mormon, have teamed up in developing a cable
network that in its first year has more than doubled its reach.
   VISN, standing for Vision Interfaith Satellite Network, is now
distributed on 38l cable systems across the nation, some serving
several communities, and reaching 7 million households, up from 3
million at the outset.
   It also has more than tripled its programming time on the air
from five hours to 18 hours daily.
   ``One of the things we've had going for us is the terrific cable
network interest in the breadth of sponsoring religious groups,''
says Jeff Weber, the network's executive vice president.
   The main religious denominations had virtually been ``left out
in the cold'' by the profusion of contributions-seeking individual
preachers buying commercial time, but the new network is
counterbalancing that scene.
   ``Our programs are for faith groups that represent the broad
concerns and interests of the American people,'' he added in an
interview. ``The way we're geared up gives them an opportunity to
use TV in ways not done before.''
   A wide variety of values-oriented programs are offered, dramas,
magazine-style shows on various issues, problem counseling, select
movies with discussion before an after, call-in talk shows,
religious news, documentaries and others.
   Also included are cartoons and other children's programs and
even a couple of comedy series about bumbling and silliness within
the religious fold.
   ``The last thing the network wants to be is heavy-handed,''
Weber said. ``There's plenty of room for laughter in heaven.''
   The network prohibits proselytizing for particular denominations
or soliciting funds. That has been ``abused in the past,'' Weber
said. ``We're not in the business of taking money out of the local
church.''
   The Rev. Wilford V. Bane Jr. of Nashville, Tenn., a United
Methodist and the network's general manager and president, said,
``We want to stimulate people to get involved in their own
communities.''
   However, he said ``we can provide a perhaps larger perspective
and put faith in a context beyond local experience. TV can add
dimensions that challenge folks.''
   He recited a list of renowned religious thinkers who have
appeared on shows discussing such questions as ``Who is God? Who is
Jesus? What does prayer mean? Why evil?'' and added:
   ``Persons of that stature talking in one's living room about
questions of that depth certainly adds a dimension to people's
religious experience.''
   The coalition of 22 denominations owning the year-old network
includes most major U.S. religious bodies, Episcopal, Lutheran,
Jewish, Presbyterian, American Baptist, Methodist, Roman Catholic,
Greek Orthodox and Mormon.
   Smaller groups such as the Mennonites, Moravians, Seventh-day
Adventists and Salvation Army also are participants.
   Weber, 42, a Presbyterian layman who previously worked in
commercial television, said, ``We want to reach people who wouldn't
watch the typical TV religion fare which offers prepackaged answers.
   ``We want to help focus on the questions themselves. There are a
variety of ways of doing it, dramas, documentaries, call-in shows,
profiles of characters, dealing with the kinds of questions that
are being asked.
   ``We want to help people in their own struggle with questions of
faith.''
   But the fare also entertains, particularly the dramas and music.
   About half the programs are produced by participating
denominations, including some worship services but mostly different
kinds of shows, the other half obtained from other producers in
this country and abroad.
   Denominations pay costs of their own productions, supplying them
free to the network, which thus is able to operate on a relative
small central budget of about $6 million annually, most of it for
satellite transmission.
   About a third of this, a steadily growing proportion, now is
covered by fees from cable systems, the rest in subsidized funding
from the cable industry guaranteed through the next two years and
renewable.
   By that time, the network expects to be doubled again in size,
reaching more than 15 million homes, and self-supporting. It is
beginning to sell selective advertising, but that source still ``is
minimal,'' Weber said.
   The network, with a small central staff of 15, operates at
studios in Trinity Church in downtown Manhattan.
   Bane said the varied programming sparks religious concern,
sometimes in ``almost invisible ways,'' and should help bring ``a
resurgence of Judeo-Christian values back into mainstream
thinking.''
   Added Weber: ``The timing is right. The decade of the '90's is
going to see a turning back to faith in meaningful ways.''

<HEAD>Bush Seeks Social Security `Integrity Fund'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush wants to set up a Social
Security integrity fund, a budget proposal that sounds a bit like
conscience money.
   It is his alternative to a bill that would cut Social Security
taxes, a measure on which the administration still worries about an
election-year congressional runaway.
   The integrity fund idea has the ring of virtue, with a lobbying
purpose. It would be phased-in virtue, supposedly taking full
effect to make payments against the national debt in 1996. For Bush
budget-makers, there's an advantage in delay. For the next two
years they can continue counting the booming Social Security
reserve fund, growing at about $1 billion a week, against their
estimates of the federal budget deficit.
   That will offset about $60 billion in deficit spending over the
next year, even though the money can't be used directly to pay for
current budget demands. The government has a way around that. It
borrows the Social Security money.
   Budget Director Richard G. Darman calls the integrity fund plan
a responsible way to protect the future benefits of the people who
are paying into the Social Security system now.
   ``But Social Security is a notoriously volatile subject when it
enters the political arena, and whether rationality will prevail
remains to be determined,'' Darman said in the budget essay he sent
Congress.
   That volatility shows in the sudden rise of Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan's proposal to cut Social Security taxes, choking off the
surpluses that are being borrowed to pay for other government
spending. The New York Democrat says that's the only way to end
misuse of the trust fund reserves. He said he'd been trying for two
years to get the administration to leave the trust fund alone, with
no success.
   Moynihan said the government should be forced to stop using
Social Security reserves now, before it becomes totally dependent
on them. ``You wait five years ... and they will have a $3
billion-a-week habit,'' Moynihan said.
   But Darman said the proposal would hurt today's taxpaying
workers one way or another. ``It would either force an increase in
their non-Social Security taxes ... or it would force a reduction
in their future retirement benefits,'' he said.
   Moynihan said it was his side that sought to protect the
integrity of the Social Security fund. ``But our hope has been
dashed by the repeated determination of the administration and the
Congress to use Social Security contributions as if they were
general revenue,'' he said as he introduced the tax cut bill.
   The administration's countermeasure is to be called the Social
Security Integrity and Debt Reduction Fund. It would appear in
budgets beginning on Oct. 1, 1992.
   That proposal starts with the premise that the budget will be
balanced in 1993, as required by current law. That is at best a
shaky premise, even though the presumably balanced budget would
continue to count the Social Security surplus to offset deficit
spending.
   After all, Jimmy Carter and then Ronald Reagan both took office
promising to balance the budget within one term. It went up sharply
under Carter and multiplied under Reagan.
   The Bush budget acknowledges that without a change in the
bookkeeping system, chances are that future budgets would show
surpluses because of Social Security reserves, and that Congress
would be likely to spend the money on other programs.
   That's the Moynihan argument, although he blames it on the
administration.
   His solution is to cut taxes now, put Social Security on a
pay-as-you-go basis, and eliminate the temptation to spend the
money elsewhere by not collecting it in the first place.
   The administration proposal would continue counting Social
Security and its surplus as part of the budget, and would require
that all future budgets be balanced. But the government would set
aside appropriations equal to part, and eventually all, of the
projected Social Security surpluses.
   That's the integrity fund. It would be used to make payments
against the national debt.
   For the year beginning Oct. 1, 1992, the appropriation would be
15 percent of the estimated Social Security surplus for the
following 12 months. That would go to gradually, to equal the full
annual surplus in the 1996 budget.
   According to the administration, that would protect the trust
fund, substantially reduce the national debt, and strip away ``a
temptation for additional spending.''
   At some point, if all that happened, there would have to be
sharp cuts in other federal programs or sharp increases in other
taxes, or both.
   Then again, by 1996, somebody else will be elected president.

   David Suchet, the new Hercule Poirot on PBS'
``Mystery!,'' first became acquainted with Agatha Christie's
supersleuth four years ago in the movie ``Thirteen At Dinner.''
   In that 1985 TV movie, Peter Ustinov starred as Poirot and
Suchet was the plodding Inspector Japp, Scotland Yard's man on the
scene who's outwitted by Poirot at every turn.
   ``I was able to observe Peter up close,'' Suchet said. ``I had
no idea at the time I was going to play Poirot myself.''
   Suchet is the third Poirot in recent years; Albert Finney also
played him in the 1974 movie ``Murder on the Orient Express.''
   Christie's books describe Poirot as fat, but Suchet had just
shed 35 pounds before taking on the role, so he needed padding over
most of his body to attain the detective's bulbous shape.
   ``I wear a lot of padding and a little fake wax moustache,'' he
said.
   Nine episodes of ``Agatha Christie's Poirot'' will be telecast
this season on ``Mystery!,'' which is celebrating its 10th year.
The ``Poirot'' series began two weeks ago and continues until March
15.
   The episodes also star Hugh Fraser as Poirot's eager assistant,
Capt. Arthur Hastings, Philip Jackson as Inspector Japp, and
Pauline Moran as Poirot's secretary, Miss Lemon. The setting is
1935, so the stories reflect the fashions, atmosphere and politics
of Britain's upper class in places ranging from England to the
Mediterranean.
   Poirot is, of course, noted for his ``little gray cells'' and
his uncanny ability to unmask all the killers, kidnappers,
poisoners, plotters, thieves and treacherous lovers who cross his
path.
   He's eccentric, eating a breakfast every day of two boiled eggs
that must be exactly the same size and compulsively tidying up any
room he walks into.
   ``He's very smart. He's a brilliant listener,'' said Suchet.
``Agatha Christie was very clever with Arthur Hastings. She didn't
make him a dimwit. She gave him a sidekick who can reason with him
as a reader would. Hastings goes for the obvious. That allows
Poirot to take his ideas off the wall. He doesn't believe what he
sees.
   ``It's a clever device that allows Poirot to do all this
thinking and then flash his green light and arrive at the
solution.''
   The eccentric little detective first appeared in the 1920 book
``The Mysterious Affair at Styles.''
   ``Agatha Christie had no idea he would become so popular,''
Suchet said. ``She once said had she known, she would have made him
younger. He must have been 180 when he died in the last book, `The
Final Curtain.' She wrote something like 40 short stories and 30
books.''
   Although he lives just outside of London, Suchet is a frequent
visitor to this country.
   ``I'm one Englishman who loves America,'' he said. ``I did a
truck-and-bus Shakespeare tour. I visited nearly every state.''
   He played the Soviet contact in ``The Falcon and the Snowman''
and an Israeli spy in ``The Little Drummer Girl'' and also had
roles in the movies ``Harry and the Hendersons'' and ``The Last
Innocent Man.''
   His English home, near Harrow, once was occupied by Horatia
Nelson, the daughter of Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton.
   ``The roof beams are taken from ships that defeated the Spanish
Armada,'' he said. ``It was originally a small house, but it's had
some Victorian and Edwardian additions.''
   Suchet grew up in London, where his father was a doctor. He
studied acting at the London Academy of Music and Arts, where one
of his classmates was John Lithgow, who starred in ``Harry and the
Hendersons.''
   He's a former member of the Royal Shakespeare Co. and has
appeared in numerous British television productions. In one recent
BBC production, ``Bingo,'' he played William Shakespeare after the
bard's retirement to Stratford.
   ``My career has been very fortunate,'' Suchet said. ``I don't
believe actors can plan a career. My measure of success has nothing
to do with money or fame. It has to do with being offered enough
scripts that you can pick and choose.''

<HEAD>A Bridge Over Troubled Real Estate Waters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You just received that long-awaited job
promotion on the West Coast but you cannot move the family into a
new home until your condominium in the Northeast is sold.
   Or you've discovered your dream house could be had for a song,
but only if you raise the money from the sale of your present home
before another anxious buyer gets there.
   In both situations the bottlenecked homeowner could use a quick
cash fix to bridge the gap between the purchase of the new home and
sale of the old.
   ``Bridge'' or ``swing'' loans offer consumers the short-term
financing, usually three to six months, to cover the new down
payment and closing costs. These loans have been around a number of
years, helping buyers take quick advantage of a home bargain, make
a down payment on a house under construction or simply relieve some
of the presssure of house-hunting.
   But experts warn they're not for everyone, particularly those
likely to need them most these days _ homesellers living in regions
where sales have been especially soft.
   ``What you have to emphasize is that there's a `Buyer Beware!'
warning on this product,'' said Tara Little, a spokeswoman for the
American Bankers Association, a Washington-based trade group. ``If
things fall through and the borrower can't find a buyer for the
first home, he still has to pay off the loan.''
   An alternative may be to get a longer-term standard home-equity
loan to cover the down payment on a new home and rent the old house
until it's sold. The interest on both types of loans is fully
deductible up to $100,000. However, one disadvantage to home equity
loans is they take much longer to process.
   Bridge loans, though, aren't easy to obtain. While there are few
available statistics, some experts estimate only about a quarter to
a third of all banks and thrifts nationwide regularly offer them.
   Those that do rarely promote them. ``In 14 years of publishing .
.. I doubt we've seen more than two bridge loan ads,'' said Robert
Heady, who runs the North Palm Beach, Fla., publication Bank Rate
Monitor.
   Further complicating matters is that most lenders negotiate
bridge loans on a case-by-case basis, with terms depending largely
on an individual's credit history.
   Lenders say they look for borrowers with steady income, little
credit-card debt or major loans besides a mortgage, and with a home
in a fairly stable housing market.
   ``If it's in a good market we'll do it. In a depressed
marketplace we'll back away,'' said Michael G. Noah, director of
consumer lending for Goldome bank in Buffalo, N.Y. ``The last thing
we want to do is get into the real estate market.''
   Noah said Goldome's loans are secured by the equity in the
property up for sale.
   To provide a safety cushion most lenders offer bridge loans
equal to around 75 percent to 80 percent of the value of the
borrower's current home, minus outstanding mortgages, provided the
home is under contract to a buyer. Some banks will lend a little
less without a contract.
   Say John and Mary Homeowner need money in a hurry for a
downpayment on a $300,000 home. The house they have is valued at
$250,000, and they have $90,000 left on their primary mortgage.
Based on the 75 percent ``safety cushion,'' they technically could
be eligible to borrow up to $97,500, or almost a third of the value
of the new house.
   Many lenders will only make these loans to first mortgage
applicants, said Paul Havemann, a vice president at Butler,
N.J.-based HSH Associates, which publishes mortgage market
information.
   Some insist on interest payments only on a monthly basis, with
the balance to be repaid when the loan is due. Others ask for no
payment until the note is due, Havemann said.
   The interest on bridge loans is linked to the prime rate, plus
one or two percentage points. Some lenders charge more, in addition
to tacking on hefty loan origination fees.
   A fortunate few homeowners, however, can get help from their
employer.
   Many of the nation's biggest companies provide relocating
workers with interest-free bridge loans, said Charles Martel,
director of client relations for PHH Homequity. The Wilton, Conn.,
company buys the homes of employees on behalf of client companies'
employees based on the homes' appraised value, and resells them.
   Martel said he's seen about a 10 percent jump nationwide in
company-sponsored bridge loans over last year. He said he's also
seen a rise in the number of employees who opt for PHH Homequity to
buy their home rather than sell it themselves _ 55 percent this
year vs. around 40 percent a year ago.

<HEAD>In Pursuit Of Zero Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Would you really like to see zero inflation?
   A lot of people would, including Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board, and at least one president of a Federal
Reserve Bank, W. Lee Hoskins of Cleveland.
   These are knowledgeable people, with as much power as anyone to
see that their views are accomplished. Already, they are in pursuit
of those goals.
   Also of that mind are some academic theoreticians, lots of
business people, and some folks in the financial community, where
inflation or its threat is considered an enemy to securities.
   Many ordinary folks might like it too. Retirees enjoy knowing
their pension won't be eroded. Savers want assurance that their
money won't diminish in buying power. Workers want raises to mean
something.
   Many people would like to see inflation disappear simply because
they have come to think of it as evil, sinful, deceitful,
destructive _ a killjoy that ruins the party. Repeatedly, it is so
described in the media.
   In all, inflation is about the most popular enemy in economics,
with very few people having anything good to say about it. To
support it or defend it is likely to ruin anyone's reputation for
common sense.
   Yet, in the past 60 years inflation generally has been
accompanied by economic growth, while its absence has almost always
been associated with recession or depression.
   True, some of that growth is an illusion, with rising prices
shaving from buying power almost as much or more than is added to
paychecks. That's one of the raps against inflation _ it is
deceptive.
   It is also well known and documented that high or rising
inflation is often a prelude to recession, even a cause, and most
certainly a reflection of unsustainable growth rates.
   Using as measuring sticks the 1982 dollar and the so-called
gross national product deflator, the most broad-based inflation
index, only in 1936 did inflation average exactly zero for the year.
   While that was in the midst of the Great Depression, it was one
of the better years within it. GNP grew sharply, only to fall again
in 1938. In most years of the Great Depression, however, there was
no inflation whatever.
   In fact, you might say deflation ran wild. The worst of it was
in 1932, when ``inflation'' reached minus 11.5 percent, but it was
also evident in every year from 1930 through 1934, and again in
1938 and 1939.
   In 1949, the inflation-deflation rate dipped below zero again,
to 0.4 percent, and while the economy didn't shrink it also failed
to grow. Since then there has always been at least 1 percent
inflation, the least being in 1961.
   This record, it can be argued, might add up to nothing. Still,
it is hard to dispute the empirical evidence that the pursuit of
zero inflation may be dangerous.
   Theory bolsters the contention. For example, proponents and
opponents of the zero-inflation goal agree that to bring down any
existing level of inflation means slowing economic expansion.
   Any slowdown, of course, is reflected in and demonstrated by
statistical evidence of curtailed production, sales, profits, wages
and layoffs, and perhaps in lower corporate stock prices and
dividends too.
   An intentionally induced slowdown, implemented by restraining
money supply and keeping interest rates high, is a fragile
undertaking. At best, it is probably mere guesswork as to when to
apply or relieve pressure.
   During this time the Fed must rely on statistical measurements,
and some of those measurements provide evidence after the fact;
when they reveal their news it is already too late. To seek zero,
therefore, is to risk recession.
   There is also error to contend with.
   Each year, economist Walter J. Williams surveys his colleagues
at a meeting of the National Association of Business Economists.
Last year he found 72 percent of them were unhappy with the quality
of government data.
   It is worth noting, he said, ``and perhaps a little
frightening,'' that the greatest skepticism was directed at numbers
generally given the most weight by financial decision-makers.
   Among them are reports on the gross national product, whose
expansion or shrinkage determines whether we are in recession.

<HEAD>Bush Administration More Open to Religious Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   After being mostly snubbed by the White House for the past
decade, U.S. religious leaders are finding the present
administration is more receptive. Consequently, they're giving it
their views _ and anxieties.
   They've also received some encouragement from it.
   ``Certainly there has been more openness on the part of the Bush
administration,'' said Mary Cooper, acting director of the
Washington office of the National Council of Churches.
   The latest concern stressed by religious officials in a Jan. 19
meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III has been the
harassment, arrests and sometimes killing of church workers in El
Salvador.
   According to the delegation, Baker voiced strong support for the
work of the churches in El Salvador, saying it needed to go on
unhindered, and said the administration firmly rejects claims the
churches are fronts for rebels.
   That charge has been regularly made by the Salvadoran army in
forays on religious institutions.
   The delegation, with whom Baker met at President Bush's request,
gave him documents detailing 54 searches by Salvadoran military
forces of 40 different church facilities and homes of church
workers in a one-month period.
   Last November, six Roman Catholic priests were killed and scores
of church workers arrested, most of them since deported. The
country's Lutheran bishop, Medardo Gomez, his life threatened as a
``subversive,'' now is in exile.
   Baker wrote to Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani on Dec. 11
emphasizing U.S. concern for ``the well-being of the religious
community and humanitarian assistance workers.''
   The nine-member inferfaith delegation of Protestant, Roman
Catholic and Jewish leaders who met with Baker expressed
appreciation for that appeal, but cited incidents of harassment of
churches still occurring.
   Although the general situation has eased, ``there is still a
climate of pervasive fear and tension,'' said the Rev. Daniel
Weiss, general secretary of American Baptist Churches.
   Weiss, who has made several trips to El Salvador, said he found
the Salvadoran government seemed to consider the churches' work
``to feed the hungry, to help the uprooted, to resettle refugeees''
as political acts.
   Both the religious leaders and Baker expressed hope for settling
the conflict through negotiations, but Baker defended continued
U.S. military aid, while the religious leaders opposed it.
   ``We said we will not back off'' on that matter, said United
Methodist Bishop Melvin G. Talbert of San Francisco. ``What we're
pushing for is for both sides to come to the table.''
   Episcopal Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning, who has met
several times with Bush, said, ``I think Secretary Baker heard our
concerns.''
   Religious delegations also had met earlier with administration
officials.
   Three Roman Catholic bishops, including Arcbishop Daniel E.
Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, president of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, met with Bush aides at the White House on Dec. 22
_ also about El Salvador.
   Urging negotiations to end the conflict, the bishops called for
an ``end to the pattern of harassment, threats and intimidation''
against religious workers.
   An interfaith delegation met last November with State Department
officials on the same issue.
   Meanwhile, many churches across the country have scheduled
prayer vigils, fasting and sermons about El Salvador between now
and March 24, which is the 10th anniversary of the assassination of
Salvadoran Roman Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero.
   Miss Cooper, an Episcopalian, said the government has been much
more willing to listen to religious views under Bush's leadership.
She said President Reagan ``was just not interested.''
   She said church `relations were fine'' with President Carter, a
Southern Baptist, and ``we had a good, active relationship'' with
President Ford, an Episcopalian. She said contacts were almost nil
with Ford's predecessor, Richard Nixon, a Quaker.
   The Very Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky, president-elect of the National
Council of Churches, said that in a meeting with State Department
officials plans were laid for regular meetings with religious
leaders.
   The purpose of the discussions will be to ``look at the baseline
of factual information we agree on'' and share perspectives,
Kishkovsky said, recognizing that churches will have special
insights and sometimes criticisms.
   He said the meetings were expected to be monthly or every other
month.

   Protestant, Jewish and Roman Catholic leaders
at an interreligious convocation urged more joint theological and
community efforts to end what they called the ``cold war'' among
religions.
   ``The creation of a world at peace is one of the foundation
stones of both Judaism and Christianity,'' but their ``cold war''
undermines the credibility of that message, said Rabbi A. James
Rudin, interreligious affairs director of the American Jewish
Committee.
   The Rev. John B. Cobb Jr., a United Methodist theologian of
Claremont University, said a step toward ending the ``war'' was to
bring out ``new overlaps among our faiths'' to inform public life
and public schools.
   He said American society ``has not faced up to the difficulty of
transmitting values apart from schools whose ethos is formed by
particular religious traditions. What is needed is open interaction
from which would emerge agreements on values that all can support.''
   He urged ``rethinking of our theology so that the most
wholehearted commitment to Christ will be the strongest reason for
the full acceptance of Judaism as a companion in the service of
God.''

   It's a long way from the verdant slopes of the
Andes to the murky caverns of the New York subway system. But then,
the Otavalo Indians of Ecuador pride themselves on adaptability.
   An innate wanderlust, and their homeland's worst economic
recession in 50 years, have propelled ``Imbaya Kuna'' to seek their
fortunes in the United States, Germany, France, Spain and points
elsewhere.
   Clad in dark alpaca wool ponchos over their tribe's traditional
white duck pants, long braids topped by fedora hats to ward off
evil spirits, the six young musicians from the mountain hamlet of
Otavalo lend a touch of exotica to the dingy subterranean train
stations where they _ and other musicians and entertainers _ play
for tips.
   The scene forms a stark contrast to their natural habitat on the

expansion or shrinkage determines whether or not we are in
recession.

<HEAD>Agriculture Department Budget-Writers Get Creative</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the arcane, drawn-out process of designing
a $48.7 billion spending plan for the Agriculture Department,
somebody got a little more creative than usual with a couple of
programs.
   In an effort to get Congress to swallow what it refused to in
the past, department budget-writers added a few sweeteners.
   Take the school lunch program, for instance, which serves meals
to more than 24 million children each day. If you want to help more
poor children, the administration says, let the richer children pay
their own way.
   According to USDA's own analysis of President Bush's budget
proposals sent to Congress last week, unless lawmakers buy the 1991
school lunch blueprint, the program will need about $3.4 billion
next year, up $200 million from 1990.
   The money, which includes USDA-donated commodities, is used to
subsidize meals served by schools, based on a child's family
income. A middle-income student might pay a ``reduced cost'' price
for lunch, a truly low-income child can eat free of charge.
   As it is, all meals are subsidized, regardless of a child's
family income. Those from affluent homes pay full price for lunch
at school cafeterias, but those meals still carry a federal subsidy.
   The White House budget proposal, which originated in the Office
of Management and Budget, would eliminate federal meal subsidies
for children from affluent homes, an idea that goes back many
years. Each time Congress has tossed it aside.
   But the latest OMB plan also seeks legislation to require
children with family incomes of more than 350 percent of the
federal poverty level, or $42,350 a year for a family of four, to
pay more for school meals. At current rates, their share of the
subsidy is 28 cents per serving. That would save $235.4 million
next year.
   Department officials estimate more than 4.8 million children
from affluent families are eating subsidized school meals each day.
   About $54.3 million of the savings would then be spent on more
than 1.6 million ``middle poor'' kids who qualify for reduced
prices in school cafeterias. Their family income would be in the
range of 130 percent to 185 percent of the government's poverty
level, or $15,730 to $22,385 a year.
   Those would pay only 20 cents per meal instead of the current 40
cents.
   Free meals would continue to be available for 10 million
children from homes below 130 percent of the poverty standard, or
$15,730 a year for a family of four.
   No change in the subsidy rates would be planned for 8.1 million
children from homes in the 185 percent to 350 percent income
category, $22,385 to $42,350 a year for a four-member family.
   The net savings in the school lunch program, according to USDA
budget people, would be a tidy $181.1 million, simply by requiring
the top-bracket children to pay more for their meals.
   The Farmers Home Administration plan also has a little sweetener
to help the medicine go down.
   The FmHA would be able to handle less than $3.4 billion in farm
loans in 1991 under the Bush plan, down from $4.2 billion estimated
this fiscal year, according to the USDA budget analysis.
   A further emphasis will be put on FmHA guaranteed loans instead
of direct loans by the agency itself. This has been a trend for
some years, with guarantees exceeding direct loans since 1987.
   Under the guarantee procedure, banks or other commercial
institutions lend money to farmers, and the FmHA provides a
guarantee that the debt will be repaid. However, guarantees have
not been popular with many hard-pressed farmers because of higher
interest rates charged by commercial lenders.
   ``Wherever possible, new borrowers will be assisted through
guaranteed rather than direct loans, and existing borrowers will be
graduated to private sector credit using a guarantee where
necessary,'' said the USDA analysis. ``This shift will allow FmHA
to provide more intense supervision to those borrowers who can only
be reached by direct loans.''
   Undersecretary Roland R. Vautour, who oversees the USDA's small
community and rural development programs, suggested an interest
subsidy for farmers taking out FmHA guaranteed loans instead of
direct agency financing.
   The OMB bought the idea and incorporated it into the Bush
budget. Analysts estimated the subsidy would average about 3
percentage points, meaning a loan that might cost a borrower 11
percent could be had for 8 percent with the FmHA subsidy.
   In 1991, the subsidies would be used on $350 million in FmHA
farm operating loans and $50 million of farm ownership loans.
   Meanwhile, the 1991 plan calls for cutting FmHA farm operating
direct loans to $500 million from an estimated $932 million this
year. Direct farm ownership loans would drop to $38 million from
$80 million.
   Whether these and other USDA budget maneuvers will survive the
will of Congress remains to be seen.

   There's a story that Claude Monet began his
``series'' paintings because the light was changing so fast on a
grain stack he was painting that he kept asking his stepdaughter to
run for more canvases.
   ``It's a kind of wonderful and amusing but completely fallacious
tale,'' said Paul H. Tucker, associate professor of art at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston and guest curator of ``Monet
in the '90s: The Series Paintings,'' which opens at the Museum of
Fine Arts on Wednesday.
   Monet, the leading French Impressionist, is known to have done
218 ``series'' paintings, all but 12 during the 1890s when he was
in his 50s.
   He chose 16 subjects, some for their historical or cultural
significance. Among the works were 30 paintings each of grain
stacks and the Rouen Cathedral, 24 paintings of poplars, and 18 of
the Japanese bridge over his waterlily garden at Giverny.
   There are 86 in the exhibition, more than twice the number Monet
ever showed at one time. The works have been loaned from all over
the world, including Leningrad, Paris, Tokyo and Boston.
   ``This is the largest of all the series ever assembled,'' said
Tucker.
   Why Monet painted series is not absolutely certain, he said, but
the Monet specialist thinks one reason was to show the wide-ranging
effects of nature.
   Another was to answer the challenges posed by younger artists,
especially Georges Seurat, whose ``A Sunday on the Island of the
Grande Jatte'' in 1886 was an enormous challenge to Impressionism.
   ``It was an assault,'' Tucker said.
   Monet responded to the challenges with the revolutionary idea of
doing a series of paintings on the same subject.
   ``He carved out a completely new niche. ... It was very
inventive, very daring,'' Tucker said.
   Monet painted his subjects in different seasons, at different
times of day, sometimes from different angles.
   ``One of the wonders of the show is to be able to compare and
contrast,' Tucker said. The style differs for almost every series
as well, in terms of color, composition and the way the paint was
applied.
   The series paintings were a way ``for him to assert the
continued vitality of Impressionism,'' Tucker said.
   The repeating images responded to the repetitiousness in
Seurat's style of painting with dots, while retaining an
individualism Monet believed was lacking in Seurat's work, Tucker
said.
   Though the approach and style were revolutionary, they were not
Monet's sole concern. ``He wants us in the end to be more attuned
to nature as well,'' Tucker said.
   Not one of the series is intact in a single collection, although
statesman Georges Clemenceau urged the president of France to buy
all the Rouen Cathedral paintings for the country.
   ``The most important thing was to sell,'' said Tucker, and some
paintings from a series were sold before the series was exhibited.
   ``I'm sure (Monet) would have been thrilled if an individual
collector bought them all, (but) he wanted to have them sold. He
probably had a big mortgage, too.''
   Tucker wrote the text _ more a book than a catalog _ that
accompanies the exhibit. He began research for a book on Monet's
series paintings six years ago while on a sabbatical, and in
talking with people at the Museum of Fine Arts, an exhibit of the
paintings was suggested.
   The museum, which has 38 Monet paintings, the largest collection
outside Paris, organized the exhibition.
   ``These are paintings of extraordinary beauty which speak
eloquently of the concerns of French culture and civilization,''
Peter Sutton, the museum's curator of European paintings, said of
the series paintings.
   After closing in Boston April 29, the exhibit will be at the Art
Institute of Chicago from May 19 through Aug. 12 and at the Royal
Academy in London from Sept. 7 through Dec. 9.

   He considers himself a loyal member of the
Communist Party and remains an admirer of senior Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping. But in the waning days of last spring's
pro-democracy demonstrations, Gao Xin and three others staged a
hunger strike in Tiananmen Square. For that he spent six months in
jail. Here Gao describes how he was treated.

   Gao Xin, denounced by Chinese authorities as a
counter-revolutionary plotter, walked out of jail after 185 days _
12 pounds thinner, his job gone and his wedding plans on hold.
   In releasing him, the authorities didn't say Gao was
rehabilitated, forgiven, or even cleared. They had never formally
charged him with anything. Gao says the guards told him that the
investigation into his activities was completed.
   The government said recently it has freed 573 people arrested
for taking part in the crushed spring democracy movement, out of
thousands jailed in Beijing alone.
   But Gao and others who have been freed have found their troubles
are not over. Their lives have been irrevocably changed by what _
for some _ was an impulse of the moment to join in the student-led
protests.
   Gao, perhaps the first of the protesters to speak for the record
about their experiences in jail, says he wanted to tell his story
out of a sense of responsibility ``to history and to the Chinese
nation.''
   Gao's crime was to join with three friends, all young
intellectuals, in staging a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square in
the movement's final days. Gao, 33, was a Communist Party member
who until then stayed out of the protests, keeping busy at his job
editing Beijing Normal University's official newspaper.
   But when the government declared martial law on May 20, he _
along with tens of thousands of Beijing residents _ joined the
students.
   ``I did it because I opposed martial law,'' Gao says. ``The
army's guns should be pointed outward, not inward at the people.''
   But Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong denounced the four hunger strikers
as agitators who sought to overthrow the government.
   Gao says was strolling outside his fiancee's apartment on June
14 when an unmarked car stopped. Four men got out and told him to
come along, he recalls.
   He was taken to a small jail where prisoners were held for short
periods before being tried or executed. There, he says, he shared a
90-square-foot cell with at least seven men at a time, most of them
accused of crimes such as rape, murder or theft.
   Only twice in his six-month stay was he let out for exercise, he
says. The cell had a small window, but the heat was overwhelming.
The light was kept burning at night. No books or newspapers were
allowed.
   Four men could sleep on a wooden platform that filled half the
cell. The others slept on bedrolls on the floor.
   Relatives could not visit. Gao's family was not even told of his
arrest. His fiancee, Zhang Xiaomei, went from police station to
station seeking news of his whereabouts, but was told each time,
``We aren't clear.''
   Only in October was Gao allowed to send her a postcard with a
list of clothing and toiletries for her to bring to him. Guards
took the package in to Gao.
   But in other ways, he says, the guards treated him with courtesy
not afforded the common criminals in his cell.
   ``The others got only two steamed rolls at lunch and dinner, but
the guards gave me as many as I wanted, because they sympathized
with me,'' he says. ``I think they had consciences and a sense of
justice.''
   The other prisoners were told to sit quietly, but Gao was
allowed to pace back and forth, he says. He estimates he walked
over 10 miles a day.
   His cellmates came and went. A 19-year-old accused of robbing
and killing two taxi drivers gave Gao his T-shirt before being led
away to be executed.

   After several months, Gao says, he was made cell monitor and
given a makeshift pen _ an ink cartridge wrapped with tape _ so he
could fill out a daily form evaluating his cellmates. He used it to
write poems on the inside of the T-shirt:
   ``Words transcribed in prison
   ``I give to Xiaomei,
   ``One glance and the one with my heart
   ``Knows who wrote it ...''
   He also scrawled poetry on a roll of toilet paper. Sometimes he
recited for the other prisoners.
   ``They liked it even though I write bad poetry,'' Gao recalls.
``They were bored. Before I came they would tell dirty stories .. .
and bully the newcomers. So I gave them lectures about poetry. They
called me teacher and they cried when I left.''
   Gao was questioned only rarely, and was given no clue about his
eventual fate. ``The loneliness of the spirit was terrible,'' he
recalls.
   Gao was released on Dec. 16, but two of his fellow hunger
strikers, Zhou Duo and Liu Xiaobo, remain jailed, he says. The
fourth man, Taiwanese pop star Hou Dejian, took refuge in the
Australian Embassy and left in August with Chinese guarantees he
would not be arrested.
   Gao says the government should thank the four because they led
the students in a peaceful retreat from Tiananmen Square when
soldiers surrounded it before dawn on June 4.
   ``Objectively speaking, we helped the government to avoid
bloodshed,'' he says. ``The more people who died, the harder it
would have been for the government.''
   Gao and Hou also have helped authorities by testifying that
there was no bloodbath inside the square, despite the deaths of
hundreds and possibly thousands in nearby streets. Both insist they
made no deal with the government to say so.
   On Oct. 1, the 40th anniversary of Communist rule in China, the
jail turned on loudspeakers and broadcast the festivities taking
place in Tiananmen Square. Gao says he listened with a heavy heart.
   ``I remember the 35th anniversary in 1984,'' he says. ``I was in
the square. It seemed the Communist Party was at its highest level
of prestige. Every sector of society _ peasants, workers, students
_ all had so much hope in the reforms'' that senior leader Deng
Xiaoping was enacting to shake up the economy.
   ``I wish that time could return.''
   He still pays his monthly party dues of 24 cents, and still
believes Deng is one of the greatest figures in Chinese history,
despite his orders to crush the spring movement.
   ``It was Deng who opened our eyes, who opened China and let
foreigners come in and Chinese go out. This cannot be wiped out,''
he says. ``As for whether the party can save China, we will have to
see. Right now, there is no organization that can substitute for it.
   ``I think I am a good party member. The party's guiding
principles say the party works for the interests of the vast
majority. I think what I did in Tiananmen Square was for the vast
majority.''
   Ordinary criminals freed from jail often are given their old
jobs back to aid their rehabilitation. But Gao says that when he
went back to Beijing Normal University, the school refused to let
him resume work.
   It did not formally fire him, either, meaning that in China's
controlled job market he is not free to seek new work. So he is
taking turns living with friends _ Hou, Zhang and others.
   ``They told me to wait, so I'm waiting,'' he says.
   Meanwhile, Gao says he can no longer think of marrying Zhang:
``What can I give her?''

   Little Cao spends his days in his best friend's
one-room apartment, watching television and reading.
   At night, he goes out on free-lance jobs, translating letters
and contracts into English to earn a little money. He quit his
government job in June when his boss began questioning him about
his participation in last spring's pro-democracy marches.
   But other work units won't hire him because of his suspect
political background. By quitting, he lost his office-assigned
housing. He worries that authorities will send him back to his
family's hometown unless he finds a job in Beijing soon.
   ``If you know of any foreign companies in Beijing that have
openings, please let me know,'' he pleads.
   Cao is one of the hidden casualties of June's army crackdown on
the democracy movement _ people who were not jailed but have been
punished in other, subtler ways traditional to China's communist
system.
   Some have been fired, others demoted. Several college seniors
had their degrees withheld, while others were denied approval for
planned study abroad.
   China long has used extra-legal punishments for those considered
troublemakers. During the 1966-76 far leftist Cultural Revolution,
thousands of alleged ``capitalist-roaders'' were sent to rural
villages as punishment. Just being related to a political offender
could bring trouble.
   Even now, some relatives of people arrested in June say they
have been ostracized.
   One woman whose husband was jailed said authorities have refused
to help her find a job. Most jobs must be officially arranged.
Neighbors refuse to talk to her.
   ``They figure if I'm his wife, I should suffer,'' she says.
   A college senior who was active in the movement was expelled
without his degree, losing his chance for a job assignment. He
found part-time work on his own, but still relies on friends'
support to get enough to eat. He lives in an empty storage room at
his old school, in constant fear he will be kicked out.
   Another student was allowed to graduate and was assigned a good
job at a central government office, but was fired almost
immediately. She was told she would have to work for one year in
the countryside before being assigned another job.
   One woman had her private shop shut down because she supported
the movement. Several university lecturers who encouraged their
students to march were suspended from work.
   A department head at an official newspaper was demoted to an
ordinary reporter for having marched once last spring. A reporter
on another newspaper was downgraded to a researcher, with a cut in
pay.

   When Doris Kearns Goodwin was writing her
history of the Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys, she was often only a
few chapters ahead of the screenwriter for the miniseries ``The
Kennedys of Massachusetts.''
   Goodwin's book, ``The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys,'' traces the
personal and political histories of the two families from their
Irish roots to Boston to the election of John F. Kennedy as
president.
   The six-hour miniseries will be broadcast by ABC on Sunday,
Monday and Tuesday, starring William Peterson as Joe Kennedy;
Annette O'Toole as Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy; Pat Hingle as Joe's
father, P.J. Kennedy; Charles Durning as Rose's father, John
``Honey Fitz'' Fitzgerald; Steven Weber as John F. Kennedy and
Madolyn Smith-Osborne as actress Gloria Swanson, Joe Kennedy's
long-time mistress.
   The author's 13-year-old son, Michael Goodwin, plays Joe Jr.
   The book was bought as a miniseries in 1982 in the early stages
of the manuscript, and screenwriter William Hanley, working chapter
by chapter, frequently called Goodwin to see what was coming next.
   ``Doing the research was the best part,'' said Goodwin, a former
Harvard professor who's now working on a book about the American
homefront in World War II with Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt as
the focus. It also has been sold as a miniseries.
   ``It was wonderful to find things that give you the feel and
texture of the era,'' she said. ``When I learn something, I become
very excited to get it out to the reader. `Honey Fitz' spent a year
at the Harvard Medical School, and I became so fascinated with
medicine of that period that the publisher had to tell me to cut it
out.''
   The book began as a traditional biography of President Kennedy.
Goodwin's husband, Richard Goodwin, had been a speechwriter for
Kennedy and she had been a special assistant to President Johnson
and wrote ``Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream.''
   It took on a new dimension when she began her research. One of
the great treasures she found were 150 cartons of papers saved by
Joe and Rose Kennedy. They were at the Kennedy Library, but no one
had looked at them and they had not yet been deeded to the library.
She obtained permission from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy to go through
the material.
   ``That took a year and a half,'' Goodwin said. ``They had saved
every letter, every report card, every piece of paper, even Gloria
Swanson's income tax statements. Those letters told me the internal
dynamics of the family and enabled Hanley to write their dialogue.
The papers fell into the boxes as they would fall in life. You
could see how each event related to another.''
   Asked what set the Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys apart from
millions of other Irish Catholics, Goodwin said: ``The Fitzgeralds,
and particularly Joe Kennedy, instilled into their kids that above
all else they were a family. They presented themselves to the world
like a clan. They had traditions and loyalties and rituals. The
kids knew they had to be there for dinner every night. They knew
they went to Hyannisport on a certain day.
   ``Second, part of the family ethos was that they lived on the
edge. You create your own success, and if the family backs you it
doesn't matter what the world thinks.''
   Joe Kennedy, despite his failings, gave the family a center, she
said. He drove himself and his family relentlessly to succeed,
partly because of the exclusion he had felt in Boston as an Irish
Catholic.
   The miniseries, filmed largely in Boston, evokes a strong
feeling for the period. It captures, often through banter, the
fierce loyalties and competition within the families.
   The original screenplay began in Ireland and ran for 11 hours,
but it was cut to six hours and now begins when ``Honey Fitz''
already is mayor of Boston. Like the book, it ends with Kennedy's
election to the presidency.
   After Goodwin completed the book, she wasn't sure how the
Kennedys would feel, since it exposes many family secrets.
   ``There are many times in the book when you feel anger toward
Joe or Rose,'' she said. ``I wasn't trying to judge them. I heard
the family was upset at first.
   ``Normally, the Kennedys don't read books about them. But there
was so much history about the Fitzgeralds that no one knew that
theybegan to read the book. Then I received 12 copies of the book
from Sargent Shriver, Eunice's husband. He wanted them signed for
the kids. In general, they seemed to like the book. I think they'll
feel the same way about the miniseries.''

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
said the nation probably will avoid a recession this year but
cautioned, ``I wouldn't want to bet the ranch'' on it.
   At the same time, he told the congressional Joint Economic
Committee on Tuesday that the current inflation rate of about 4.5
percent, while stable, is unacceptably high.
   His comments roiled financial markets, with traders interpreting
them as a sign the central bank will not lower interest rates

   The resignation of Peter A. Cohen as head of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the nation's second-largest brokerage,
capped a career that personified Wall Street's no-holds-barred
expansion in the 1980s as well as its recent decline.
   Cohen, 43, chairman and chief executive officer of Shearson,
stepped down Tuesday. A spokesman for the firm said he was to be
replaced as CEO by Howard L. Clark Jr., a senior executive at
Shearson parent American Express Co.

   A federal bankruptcy judge in Delaware gave SCI
Television Inc. another day to line up support for a debt
restructuring plan or face the prospect of working out its
financial problems under court supervision.
   Judge Helen S. Balick signed an order Tuesday giving SCI until
4:30 p.m. EST Wednesday to certify that it has been tendered at
least 87.5 percent of its 16{ percent senior subordinated
debentures, which the company says must be surrendered to fulfill
the terms of its latest debt restructuring plan.
   If SCI can't meet the deadline, the judge said the company would
be placed under protection of Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws
while it reorganizes. As of 4 p.m. EST Tuesday, SCI said 74.6
percent of the debentures had been tendered.

<HEAD>Citing `Cannibalization' of Airline, Committee Withdraws
Management Backing</HEAD>

   Representatives of Eastern Airlines' preferred
shareholders suggested the liquidation or outright sale of the
carrier, saying they had lost faith in management because it was
``cannibalizing'' the airline.
   ``Plainly stated, EAL's management has lost control of the
enterprise,'' the shareholders committee said in papers filed
Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here.
   ``They are simply unable to make the airline work, nor are they
able to accurately forecast its future _ even for a few weeks at a
time.''
   The committee urged U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland to
advance Eastern only enough money to keep it operating.
   The move by preferred stockholders comes after Eastern last week
filed a new reorganization plan with the court in which it proposed
to pay preferred holders no more than 10 cents on the dollar in the
form of new securities. Previously, Eastern had promised to repay
its creditors in full.
   The shareholders committee said it no longer supported current
management and called for ``dramatic steps'' to salvage value for
creditors. It said options included sale of the Miami-based airline
or liquidation of its assets.
   Eastern has been using money from the sale of assets to keep the
airline operating and to fund its reorganization as a much smaller
carrier. Proceeds from the asset sales have been placed in special
accounts monitored by the bankruptcy court.
   The shareholders committee said Eastern requested a total of
$250 million from the accounts last July, September and December,
and the judge allowed the airline to withdraw $210 million.
   Eastern filed a fourth withdrawal request Monday seeking an
additional $50 million to fund operating losses through February.
The preferred shareholders said a $40 million advance would be
enough to cover the next month.
   The committee accused Eastern of ``the cannibalization of the
airline in a frenzied attempt to keep it alive.''
   ``The airline is literally living off of the proceeds of its
asset sales, funding ever-increasing operating losses and putting
its preferred stockholders and unsecured creditors further in the
whole,'' it said.
   Eastern, which sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors last
March after its Machinists, pilots and flight attendants walked off
the job, last week submitted a revised reorganization plan that
calls for partial payment to unsecured creditors.
   Eastern proposed paying preferred stockholders, to whom it owes
$1.175 billion, no more than 10 cents on the dollar in new stock.
   It called for paying unsecured creditors only 10 percent of
their debts in cash when the airline emerges from bankruptcy
protection, and another 70 percent over the following 10 years,
without interest.
   In return for accepting partial repayment, Eastern's parent,
Texas Air Corp., would give the unsecured creditors 40 percent of
the airline's equity.
   Under Eastern's two previous plans, unsecured creditors were to
be repaid in full with interest at the completion of Chapter 11.
Eastern owes the unsecured creditors, primarily trade suppliers
such as aircraft manufacturers, around $1.1 billion.
   Eastern also said it expects to post a net loss of $280 million
for the fourth quarter, bringing losses for all of 1989 to an
estimated $850 million. The airline also projected a $125 million
net loss for the first quarter of 1990.
   ``The problem is that, by any objective yardstiock, the airline
is failing,'' the preferred shareholders said in the court papers.
``The preferred committee no longer believes that EAL is viable in
its current operating mode.''

   A House panel looking into the biggest
bankruptcy filing in retail history got an earful about the dangers
of leveraged buyouts, and the panel's chief said urged new
restrictions to prevent potential ``takeover trophies'' from
becoming ``bankruptcy debtors.''
   Witnesses ranging from the Massachusetts attorney general to the
head of the union representing Bloomingdale's workers testified
Tuesday about the problems facing Federated Department Stores Inc.
and Allied Stores Corp.
   The two retailing giants have filed for bankruptcy
reorganization because of their inability to finance debts taken on
when Campeau Corp. acquired the companies in the 1980s.
   ``The groundwork for today's fiasco was laid by the Reagan
Administration, which took a hands-off view of antitrust
enforcement,'' said Massachusetts Attorney General James M. Shannon.
   Rep. Jack Brooks, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's
economic and commercial law subcommittee, echoed that complaint,
criticizing the ``anything goes regulators of the past decade.''
   Brooks, D-Texas, warned that if the White House doesn't act to
rein in debt-financed takeovers such as leveraged buyouts, ``then
Congress must take the initiative by considering antitrust,
bankruptcy and tax legislation to stop the LBO frenzy.''
   Brooks said the Chapter 11 filing by the Campeau subsidiaries
``may have signaled that the takeover trophies of the 1980s will
soon become the bankruptcy debtors of the 1990s.''
   Toronto-based Campeau amassed $7.5 billion in debt acquiring
Allied and Federated, largely through loans and junk bonds.
   Allied and Federated, both headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio,
operate such well known chains as Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh, The
Bon Marche and Lazarus. Without the burden of their buyout debt
they would be profitable, healthy businesses.
   The subcommittee's ranking Republican, Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr.,
of New York, said Congress ``should carefully review any tax
advantages or incentives that encourage the use of the LBO
mechanism.''
   Fish said the Campeau situation pointed out ``an important flaw
in the corporate tax code. It is cheaper for a business to borrow
money through a leveraged buyout than it is to raise the necessary
funds by the more traditional issuance of stock.''
   In a leveraged buyout, a company's buyers put up its assets as
collateral to secure financing. They hope to finance the debt with
the target company's cash flow and by selling off some operations.
Interest on that debt in most cases is tax deductible, making such
deals attractive to the buyers.
   ``Since Campeau took over Federated, an estimated 10,000 jobs
have been lost; with 400 positions eliminated at Bloomingdale's
alone,'' said Lenore Miller, president of the Retail, Wholesale and
Department Store Union, which represents 4,000 Bloomingdale's
employees.
   Shannon of Massachusetts said Campeau's problems would have been
greater if he and other state attorneys general hadn't taken action
on Campeau's Federated takeover.
   He said the two main department stores in his region, Jordan
Marsh and Filene's, would have become Campeau properties if the
state officials hadn't acted. Campeau already had Jordan Marsh as
part of the Allied operation, while Federated owned Filene's.
   ``By law, the Federal Trade Commission was responsible for
reviewing this proposal at the federal level. But despite our
urging, the commission allowed the merger to go through without
even giving it an extended review,'' said Shannon.
   He said Campeau agreed to relinquish Filene's after he and
attorneys general in Maine, New Hampshire and New York threatened
to oppose Campeau's acquisition of Federated.
   Shannon said the Bush administration ``unlike its predecessor''
has shown signs ``that it intends to be more active in merger
enforcement.''
   ``We have not seen or heard his testimony and we really can't
comment,'' said Susan Ticknor, a spokeswoman with for FTC.
   But two professors said the anti-trust laws may be
``insufficient to cope with the deal mania sweeping corporate
America.''
   Walter Adams, past president of Michaigan State University and
James W. Brock, professor of economics at Ohio's Miami University
suggested requiring those behind large mergers or buyouts _ $1
billion or more _ to file a public impact statement to demonstrate
that the deal is in the national interest.

   The day before Chrysler Corp. shuts down a major
assembly plant, the company's directors will hear that more
facilities may have to close because of slumping demand, a United
Auto Workers union source says.
   Chrysler's board, which includes UAW President Owen Bieber, will
receive a report at a meeting Thursday.
   The report is expected to show that despite Friday's closing of
the Jefferson Avenue assembly plant, the nation's No. 3 automaker
still has the capacity to produce more cars than it is able to
sell, said the source, who spoke Tuesday on the condition of
anonymity.
   The report could mean more layoffs on top of the more than
10,000 already announced by Chrysler and General Motors Corp. in
recent weeks.
   U.S. automakers are facing pressure from a slump in new car
sales and increasing competition from so-called transplants, or
cars made by Japanese auto companies at new plants in this country.
   Shutting down a plant is the most serious measure an automaker
can take to cut costs, shrink new-vehicle inventories and bolster
profits.
   Bieber and other UAW leaders failed Tuesday in an attempt to
persuade Chrysler to keep the Jefferson Avenue plant open and avoid
1,700 layoffs there. The plant is the only one making Dodge Omni
and Plymouth Horizon subcompacts.
   Chrysler officials have held out the possibility that it may
have to shut other assembly plants this year as the entire industry
heads into what some analysts say is a recession.
   General Motors Corp. and Chrysler already have said they plan to
indefinitely lay off about 13,600 workers at 11 assembly plants by
the end of March. GM will close its Lakewood plant in Atlanta
indefinitely in mid-March. The other layoffs stem from production
reductions at other plants.
   Ford Motor Co. has avoided indefinite layoffs by eliminating
overtime and temporarily shutting down a variety of its factories.
   Closing or cutting production at Big Three assembly plants
typically mean layoffs at component and supplier plants operated by
the automakers or other companies. It's difficult to estimate how
many layoffs may occur because of the assembly plant closings, but
automakers have said it could be thousands of jobs.
   Most speculation about further Chrysler plant closings have
centered on its St. Louis No. 1 plant, which makes Chrysler LeBaron
coupes and convertibles and Dodge Daytona cars.
   UAW and company officials said Tuesday they didn't know if the
report would make recommendations about further plant closings.
   Bieber and Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca met for more than two
hours Tuesday, company spokesman Lee Sechler said, and discussed a
variety of issues, but focused on the Jefferson Avenue plant.
   The automaker is closing the plant because of slumping sales of
the cars. The UAW has contested the move, saying the company didn't
market the cars properly, wanting instead to cut its factory
capacity.
   ``They reviewed a number of alternatives to continuing
Omni-Horizon production, all of which had been explored and
reviewed by the company,'' Sechler said. ``None of the alternatives
or plans discussed provided sufficient volume to continue
Omni-Horizon production, so the Feb. 2 decision stands.''
   Earlier this month, the UAW presented Chrysler with a proposal
that the company continue making the two cars and market them only
in areas where Omni and Horizon cars have been selling well.
   Chrysler rejected that plan.

   A jury verdict that Ford Motor Co. violated
patent rights on intermittent windshield wipers held by a former
university professor has the potential to cost most major
automakers millions of dollars.
   Robert W. Kearns, a former professor at Wayne State University
in Detroit, won his patent infringement suit against Ford on Monday
in federal court.
   He has filed similar suits against General Motors Corp.,
Chrysler Corp., Daimler-Benz, Honda, Toyota, Nissan and 21 other
companies. The Ford case was the first to go to trial.
   Kearns claimed in his 12-year-old lawsuit that his version of
intermittent windshield wipers was unique because of a certain
combination of parts. Ford denied that.
   An eight-member jury sided with Kearns on Monday after a week of
deliberations. The jury reconvenes Feb. 26 to set damages.
   Although his suit doesn't specify damages, Kearns has said he is
seeking $50 for every Ford car built with intermittent wipers. Ford
is believed to have sold at least a million cars a year with the
device since 1982.
   The device also is a common feature on cars made by most of the
world's major automakers.
   U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn ruled earlier that Kearns failed
to prove he could have made and marketed the system on his own and
thus can claim only a royalty on each wiper, instead of Ford's
profit.
   If the inventor gets everything he wants, the case could cost
the automobile industry hundreds of millions of dollars, and
possibly more than $1 billion, The New York Times reported in
today's editions.
   Cohn barred Kearns and Ford officials from talking about the
case.
   Other automakers said they were studying the verdict closely,
but they declined to comment further.
   ``Our people need to look at the details of this Ford verdict
before we can really comment much further,'' said Honda North
America Inc. spokesman Kurt Antonius. ``Our litigation is in the
very early stages.''
   ``There are some differences in the technical and legal aspects
of our case and Ford's,'' said GM spokesman Don Postma. ``Because
the subject is in litigation we will refrain from further comment.''
   Chrysler spokesman Lee Sechler said the nation's No. 3 automaker
would not comment.
   Kearns claimed in his lawsuit against Ford that he installed a
set of his wipers on a 1962 Ford car and took it to the automaker.
   Kearns ``made numerous disclosures of confidential engineering
test designs'' to Ford engineers, the lawsuit claimed. They
repeatedly asked him to discuss designs, the lawsuit said, leading
Kearns to believe Ford would buy his system.
   Kearns, a River Rouge, Mich., native and a University of Detroit
graduate who now lives in Gaithersburg, Md., filed suit against
Ford and other automakers to protect patents he obtained between
1967-74.

   Guinness Import Co. is adding Moosehead Premium
Canadian Lager and Dos Equis beer to its roster that includes Harp
lager and Bass Ale after agreeing to pay $21 million for All Brand
Importers Inc.
   The deal announced Tuesday will make the Stamford, Conn.-based
Guinness Import the fourth-largest beer importer in the United
States, according to the the trade publication Impact.
   All Brand, which is based in Hartford, had been owned by the
British companies Grand Metropolitan PLC and Whitbread and Co. PLC.
   ``It's been our aspiration to be the best import company,
representing the best brands,'' said Brian Baldock, chairman and
managing director of Guinness Brewing Worldwide Ltd., parent of
Guinness Import.
   He said the acquisition of All Brands would add premium imports
from Mexico, Canada, Czechoslovakia and West Germany to Guinness'
lineup from Ireland and the United Kingdom.
   The deal should close within four weeks, he said.
   Shipments of imported beers to retailers fell by about 5 percent
in 1989 compared with the previous year, according to Frank
Walters, research director for M. Shanken Communications Inc.,
which publishes Impact.
   Baldock conceded that 1989 ``was a dull year for the import
sector'' but noted that import sales have climbed over the past
five to 10 years.
   ``People are basically drinking better. They are attracted to
premium brands. The long-term trend of imports in this market will
be positive,'' he said.
   In addition to Moosehead Premium and Dos Equis, All Brand
handles Moosehead Light from Canada, Sol and Superior from Mexico,
Pilsner Urquell lager from Czechoslovakia and Clausthaler
non-alcoholic malt beverage from West Germany.
   The deal does not include All Brand's right to distribute
Fosters, a beer from Australia.
   In addition to Harp and Bass Ale, Guinness imports Guinness
stout and Kaliber non-alcoholic brew and, in the Northeast,
Guinness Gold lager.
   The proposed acquisition more than doubles the case volume of
Guinness Import, the company said, and increases annual retail
sales to more than $300 million.
   Walters estimated the retail value of the U.S. import market at
about $2.6 billion, and that the combined Guinness-All Brand would
have just under 13 percent of the market.
   He said the top three beer importers are Van Munching &amp; Co. with
its Heineken brand and others at 27 percent; Barton Beers Ltd. with
Corona and others brands at 13.6 percent, and Molson Breweries USA
with its Martlet and Century importing divisions at just over 13
percent.

   Authorities believe fugitive banker Tom
Billman, accused of bilking depositors out of $106 million, is
hiding out in Europe, but they hope a $200,000 reward will help
bring him to justice in the United States.
   ``We intend to pursue Tom Billman and bring him to justice.
Although we have evidence that he intends never to return to the
United States, I am confident that some day, somewhere, we will
catch up with him,'' U.S. Attorney fo Maryland Breckinridge Willcox
said.
   The reward announced Tuesday is for information leading to the
capture and extradition of the former Community Savings &amp; Loan
chairman, who has been a fugitive for nearly 1{ years.
   Willcox said the Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund and the Postal
Inspection Service are offering the $200,000 reward, which would be
paid when Billman is brought back to Maryland to stand trial.
   Authorities also unsealed a 20-count racketeering indictment
against Billman; two other Community principals, Clayton C.
McCuistion and Barbara A. McKinney; and Crysopt Corp., a holding
company that owned Community Savings and Equity Programs Investment
Corp., a national real estate syndicate that collapsed in 1985.
   McCuistion and McKinney are living in McLean and Alexandria,
Va., respectively.
   The indictment charges the three defendants used interstate
wires and the U.S. mail to divert more than $106 million of
Community Savings depositors' funds to EPIC and EPIC-tied
companies, to ``personally enrich themselves.''
   Billman, 49, has been the subject of a federal arrest warrant
since he fled the country to avoid paying a $112 million judgment
awarded in October 1988 in Montgomery County Circuit Court.
   Willcox announced an international warrant against Billman last
June in the hope that someone would give the government information
that would lead to Billman's arrest and extradition.
   Prosecutors also said they have obtained a temporary restraining
order that blocks McKinney from spending $550,000 she received last
year from Billman in wire transfers from overseas.
   An affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Baltimore by
prosecutor Joyce M. McDonald said federal authorities learned of
the international cash transfers through wiretaps on McKinney's
phones.
   McKinney was Community Saving's former legal counsel and vice
president of the holding company that owned the S&amp;L and Crysopt
Corp. She also was the subject of a $102 million judgment in the
Montgomery County case, which currently is on appeal in the
Maryland Court of Appeals.
   McDonald's affidavit said Billman ``surreptitiously'' wired the
$550,000 to McKinney in Alexandria from somewhere in Europe early
last year. The indictment charged the trio and their company with a
conspiracy and pattern of racketeering activities allegedly begun
in 1984.

   Ford Motor Co. says it may have to take a
charge of up to $500 million against 1989 earnings because it sold
its Rouge Steel Company for less than book value.
   A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday
revealed that Ford is projecting North American production for the
first quarter of 1990 to be off 25 percent from the same period in
1989, following a 13 percent decline in the quarter just ended.
   Ford also said it would increase borrowings ``substantially''
this year because of two recent acquisitions.
   The disclosures came in a filing by a wholly owned Ford
subsidiary, Ford Motor Credit Co., seeking SEC permission to offer
$2 billion in debt securities from time to time over the next two
years.
   Ford Motor Credit provides wholesale financing and capital loans
to franchised Ford dealers and makes loans to vehicle leasing
companies.
   As part of the SEC's required disclosure to potential investors,
the registration filing revealed several situations at the parent
company:
   _ Ford's Dec. 15, 1989 sale of all the outstanding stock of
Rouge Steel Company to Marico Acquisition Corp. ``was below book
value. The amount of the charge to net income has not yet been
determined, but could range up to $500 million for the fourth
quarter and full year 1989.''
   _ Marico was merged into Rouge Steel and Ford acquired 20
percent in the resulting corporation but also is committed to
indemnify Rouge Steel for ``environmental matters'' prior to the
sale. ``Ford is unable at this time to determine the amount of its
potential responsibility for such environmental matters; however,
such costs could be substantial.''
   _ On Jan. 12 Ford announced plans to sell Ford Aerospace but
``it is uncertain when, or at what price, such sale may occur.''
   _ The acquisition of Associates, a major consumer loan concern,
and Jaguar PLC, the British luxury carmaker, ``have used and will
continue to use substantial amounts of available cash.
Consequently, it is anticipated that Ford and its affilates will
substantially increase borrowings in 1990.''
   _ Ford estimated its North American vehicle production in the
fourth quarter 1989 was ``13 percent below the fourth quarter of
1988, and estimated scheduled production for the first quarter of
1990 is estimated at 25 percent below the first quarter of 1989.''

   The magic number is $21.7 billion, the total for the hodgepodge
of tax increases, user fees and asset sales that Bush included in
his 1991 spending plan.
   Democrats say they believe the $21.7 billion represents the
amount in higher revenues the administration would be willing to
accept during budget negotiations this year.
   Both Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., and
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., told
reporters they were satisfied with Bush's new revenue total, but
they indicated they would radically alter the way the money was
raised.
   ``That revenue figure in total is something that we can accept.
Unfortunately, in Bush's budget, it is not legitimately obtained,''
Sasser said.
   Critics of the budget questioned, for instance, Bush's claim
that he would be able to push tax collections up by $2.5 billion in
1991 through ``management reforms'' at the Internal Revenue Service.
   At the center of the tax debate will be the administration's
renewed push to cut the tax on capital gains, which critics charge
would benefit the wealthy, and a rival plan by Sen. Daniel
Moynihan, D-N.Y., to trim Social Security payroll taxes by $62
billion over the next two years.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on Tuesday rejected the idea
that the administration might be willing to support Moynihan's
proposal, or at least a scaled-down version, in exchange for
Democrats dropping their opposition to the capital gains reduction.
   Brady termed Moynihan's proposal ``goofy'' and the ``height of
folly'' because it would raise doubts in Americans' minds about the
safety of the Social Security trust funds.
   Sasser said the administration was not being consistent when it
attacked Moynihan's proposal as a revenue-loser while pushing ``a
capital gains tax cut that benefits the wealthy and loses huge
blocks of revenue in the years ahead.''
   But for 1991, the administration's budget shows the capital
gains tax cut is a revenue-gainer. In fact, it would account for
the single biggest jump in tax revenues in the president's budget,
an increase of $4.9 billion.
   The higher figure is based on a belief that investors would rush
to sell assets such as stocks or real estate to take advantage of
the lower tax rate. But critics charge the lower rate would result
in a loss to the Treasury in later years.
   In all, the Bush budget proposes $15.7 billion in new tax
revenues, which would be offset by $1.8 billion in proposed cuts,
including an estimated $200 million loss in the first year from
implementation of Bush's proposed Family Savings Accounts offering
taxpayers to put away up to $5,000 annually in tax-free accounts.
   In addition, the president proposes raising $5.6 billion in new
user fees charged for providing government services, $1.6 billion
in the sale of government assets and $600 million in other new
receipts, bringing the total to $21.7 billion.
   Critics charged that Bush recycled a variety of proposals, some
dating back to the early Reagan years, that Congress has repeatedly
rejected.
   One retread is a measure to assess federal Social Security taxes
on state and local government employees in the handful of states
who are not now covered by the levy, a $3.8 billion revenue raiser
that Bush unsuccessfully sought last year.
   Panetta suggested that Congress might consider compromising on
the capital gains cut sought by Bush if the president was willing
to consider tax increases in other areas, possibly a higher top tax
rate for individuals or a boost in energy taxes.

<HEAD>Quaker Oats Funding More Oat Bran Studies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quaker Oats Co. says it funds oat-bran research
to learn more about oats, not to produce studies that will help
sell its products.
   ``I think it's safe to say that if Quaker had not been providing
research funding to universities for the past 25 years, the amount
of information known about oats in general would be far less than
it is,'' said Ron Bottrell, a spokesman for the Chicago-based
company.
   Bottrell's comments Tuesday came after the company disclosed it
is funding research aimed at substantiating the health benefits of
oat bran.
   Quaker's research-supported claim that oat-bran can help lower
cholesterol was challenged recently by a Harvard medical study of
the heavily marketed food product.
   Bottrell declined to describe two oat-bran studies partially
funded by Quaker that he said have been under way for more than a
year. But he said Quaker also helped fund a Syracuse University
study announced last week that supported findings that a low-fat
diet supplemented with oat bran can help lower cholesterol in the
bloodstream.
   Bottrell said he saw no conflict in Quaker, which controls about
70 percent of the oat-bran market, financing research that
theoretically could help sales of its products.
   ``We're not saying the new studies will be a direct refutation
of the medical study, but we think it will add to information about
the benefits of oats and oat bran,'' Bottrell said.
   The Harvard study published in the Jan. 19 issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine disputed findings that oat bran can
help lower cholesterol when eaten daily as part of a low-fat,
low-cholesterol diet.
   The Syracuse study, which will be published in the February
issue of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, agreed
with the Harvard finding that people who add oat bran to their diet
tend to cut down on other foods, thereby reducing their total fat
intake.
   But the Syracuse researchers did not conclude, as the Harvard
study did, that oat bran alone has no special cholesterol-reducing
properties.
   Quaker has responded to the Harvard study with newspaper ads
citing 10 other studies conducted over the past 27 years that
indicated oat bran has special cholesterol-lowering properties.
   Bottrell said five of those studies were partially funded by
Quaker, with additional funding from health or government agencies.
   ``We are in the oats business and we consider it our business
anything pertaining to oats,'' Bottrell said in a telephone
interview.
   Meanwhile, an informal national survey of about a dozen grocery
chains by Grocery Marketing magazine showed no drop in sales of
oat-bran cereals since the Harvard study was published, said Ryan
Mathews, the Detroit-based editor of the magazine, which is
published in Chicago.
   ``Our feeling is that the oat-bran products most at risk are the
peripheral products that have come on the market in the last couple
of years,'' Mathews said in a telephone interview.
   Peripheral products, he said, include oat-bran snack chips,
pretzels and beer, which are among the hundreds of oat-bran
products introduced in the past two years.
   Mathews' story on the survey will be published in the February
issue of Grocery Marketing.

<HEAD>Economic Gauge Up Robustly in December</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines pvs files</NOTE>

   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge rose a robust 0.8 percent in December, the Commerce
Department said today in a report indicating the nation's sluggish
economy can skirt a recession in 1990.
   The jump in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators followed a
tiny 0.1 percent gain in November and a 0.3 percent decline in
October. It was the largest increase since a similar 0.8 percent
advance last April.
   The index, composed of 11 forward-looking statistics designed to
forecast economic activity six to nine months into the future, was
the latest indication that the economy, while weak, can avoid an
actual decline in growth.
   The December report showed the index up just 0.4 percent for the
year, compared with an increase of 3.9 percent for all of 1988. It
suggests that economic activity this year could be more sluggish
than in 1989.
   Six of the statistics contributed to the December gain, led by
an increase in the backlog of manufacturers' unfilled orders.
   Others showing strength were an increase in plant and equipment
orders, higher stock prices, a rise in the money supply, an
increase in building permits and a gain in an index measuring
consumer confidence.
   The biggest drag on the index last month was a drop in the price
of raw materials. While such a decrease is considered good news for
inflation prospects, it is counted as a negative in the index
because it also can reflect declining demand.
   Other negatives were an increase in weekly unemployment claims,
a decline in orders for consumer goods and a speedup in business
delivery times.
   The average work week was unchanged.
   The various changes left the index at 145.7 percent of its 1982
base of 100. For the year, the index posted increases in seven
months: January, April, July, August, September, November and
December. It declined in February, March, May, June and October.
   In advance of the report, some analysts had suggested that the
current sluggishness is akin to flirting with a recession.
   ``I think that we're very, very close,'' said Lawrence
Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa. ``I mean, we're as close to being in a recession
without being in one as you can be.''
   Nevertheless, Chimerine and other economists found themselves
agreeing with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who told
Congress on Tuesday that, while he ``wouldn't want to bet the
ranch,'' he thinks the economy will avoid a recession.
   Growth through much of 1989 was restrained by high interest
rates resulting from the Fed's efforts to slow inflation by keeping
a tight rein on credit. Some government officials and economists
have recently urged a looser grip in order to spur growth.
   The latest Commerce report on the overall 1989 economy, the
gross national product, showed growth slowing from 3 percent in the
third quarter of 1989 to just 0.5 percent in the October-December
period.
   And many analysts foresee continued sluggish growth in much of
1990, although some see improvements as the year progresses.
   ``Things may be a little better than is widely perceived,''
suggested economist Michael Niemira of the Mitsubishi Bank in New
York. ``I think that things are likely to improve from here on
out.''
   Greenspan said in his testimony to the Joint Economic Committee:
``The imbalances and dislocations as we see in the economy today
probably do not suggest anything more than a temporary hesitation
in the continuing expansion of the economy.''
   But Chimerine was not quite so sanguine.
   ``We'll probably see positive growth, but just barely,'' he said.
   Part of Greenspan's optimism is based on comparing the Commerce
Department's current leading indicators with the indicators just
before and during previous recessions.
   ``The resulting measure suggests that the probability of a
recession developing in the next six months increased last spring
to almost 30 percent, but according to the most recent estimates
has declined to about 20 percent,'' he said.
   Using another index compiled by economists at the National
Bureau of Economic Research, which relies less heavily on data from
the manufacturing sector and does not include stock prices,
Greenspan said there is about a 10 percent chance of a recession.
   ``Both probabilities are much smaller than those occurring at
the beginning of each of the four recessions since the late
1960s,'' he said.``For example, the probability exceeded 50 percent
shortly before each of the previous recessions using the NBER
index.''
   Nevertheless, he continued, ``I wouldn't want to bet the ranch
on such statistical measures,'' and said the central bank would
continue to watch developments closely.

<TEXT>
   Japan's Saison Group announced Wednesday that it
has reached agreement with Sears, Roebuck and Co. to establish a
joint auto servicing company in Tokyo.
   Officials at the giant Japanese business group that operates
major department stores, hotels, restaurants and supermarkets as
well as consumer finance and life insurance companies, among
others, said the new company, to be called Tire Plus Co., will open
for business in March.
   Capitalized at 125 million yen, it will be equally owned by
Saison and Chicago-based Sears, which have already been running
joint life insurance and other companies in Japan.
   Saison officials said the new joint company will provide auto
maintenance services like changing tires, batteries and oil.
   Initially, they said, it will open three or four stores in
central Japan. During the initial years of business, they said,
Tire Plus will study market conditions and will create a system for
future expansion.
   Saison officials said their company and Sears have decided on
the new joint project in light of apparently strong demand in Japan
for auto maintenance services from the ever-growing motoring public.

<HEAD>Campbell Announces Plan to Sell Juice Bowl and Close England Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co., a continuing subject of
takeover speculation, says it will sell its Juice Bowl Products
subsidiary and close a foreign plant.
   David W. Johnson, Campbell's president and chief executive
officer, said Tuesday the decision came after a review of the
company's assets.
   The sale was announced amid speculation that Campbell, famous
for its canned soups, might be sold in its entirety, partly because
its stock price has remained relatively low.
   Several member's of the company's founding family, which
controls a substantial portion of Campbell stock, have said the
company should be sold.
   ``If Campbell is to achieve the level of financial strength that
its shareholders have a right to expect, we must be certain that we
are structured to obtain maximum returns from all our assets,''
Johnson said in a statement. ``These two actions are very important
and positive steps in that direction.''
   Campbell acquired Juice Bowl in 1982 to produce the company's
tomato-based juices and expand the company's vegetable juice line.
The Camden-based company said Juice Bowl, based in Lakeland, Fla.,
no longer is needed.
   Johnson said Campbell will close its frozen convenience food
plant at Sittingbourne, Kent, England. The plant employs 262 people
and produces frozen sausage rolls. Production will be moved to
another Campbell plant in Salford, England, Johnson said.

   Avon Products Inc. announced Wednesday that its
cosmetics soon will be made and sold in China.
   The beauty products company said it has begun a joint venture
with a Chinese partner, Guangzhou Cosmetics Factory, which will
provide the production plant.
   Avon said it is one of the first foreign cosmetics companies
authorized to manufacture in China and the first company either
domestic or foreign allowed to sell directly to Chinese consumers.
   James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer,
said China has enormous potential as a market for cosmetics.
   ``There are about 500 million women in China, more than the U.S.
and Europe combined,'' he said.
   Avon, based in New York, already has a major foreign presence.
Its Pacific region business has been growing rapidly in recent
years and currently accounts for about $450 million of its annual
sales of $3 billion.
   In addition to the new Chinese venture, countries in which Avon
has operations in the Pacific include Japan, the Philippines,
Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia.
   Avon is making an initial investment of $1 million in the
Chinese venture and will own 60 percent of the new company. Avon
will furnish some equipment, cosmetics formulas, technical
expertise and sales and marketing programs.
   The venture is expected to be in operation by the middle of this
year and to make a profit in its third year.
   The charter giving Avon the right right to do business in China
allows for distribution throughout the country but Avon said at
first it will concentrate on South China. More than 60 million
people live within a radius of 100 miles of Guangzhou's plant.
   About 50 makeup and skin care products will be available
initially to the Chinese but the line will be expanded over time,
Avon said.
   Avon said it expects to have at least 3,000 sales
representatives working in the Guangzhou area by the end of the
first year. The company says it now has about 1.5 million
independent representatives selling its products door-to-door
around the world.

<HEAD>Value of Software Industry Mergers Dropped in 1989, Survey Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The value of takeovers involving U.S. companies
that make computer software or offer other computer services fell
18 percent in 1989, according to a report Wednesday from an
investment bank that tracks the industry.
   Despite last year's drop to $7.3 billion from 1988's
extraordinary $8.9 billion in mergers, last year's figure was 49
percent above the previous record year of 1987. That year, the
value of such deals totaled $4.9 billion.
   The report was compiled by Broadview Associates of Fort Lee,
N.J., a leading investment banker in the computer services
industry, on behalf of Adapso, the computer services and software
industry association based in Arlington, Va.
   ``This year (1989) we saw a strong shift from deals over $100
million to middle-market transactions in the $20 million to $100
million range,'' said Broadview partner Harvey L. Poppel.
   ``The surge in middle-market transactions has been fueled by the
mounting reluctance of underwriters to take medium-sized firms
public,'' he said. ``Since such firms typically need additional
resources to achieve critical economies of scale and scope,
acquisition has emerged as a preferred route.''
   Another reason for the falloff in the value of deals last year
is that the recent earnings volatility of many public computer
software and hardware companies has scared off buyers from outside
the industry, said Charles Federman, another Broadview partner.
   The report covers companies offering software products, computer
systems integration equipment and professional services, processing
and network-based data services, training and maintenance.

   The resignation of Peter A. Cohen as head of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the nation's second-largest brokerage,
capped a career that personified Wall Street's no-holds-barred
expansion in the 1980s as well as its recent decline.
   Cohen, chairman and chief executive officer of Shearson, quit
Tuesday amid turmoil at a firm that grew from a medium-sized retail
brokerage into one of the nation's most powerful investment houses
under his leadership.
   Shearson today announced a plan to raise about $250 million by
offering stock to existing shareholders. It replaces a public
offering scrapped because of the firm's slumping stock price and
Cohen's resignation.
   Under the plan, parent American Express Co. would cut its stake
in Shearson to about 45 percent, fulfilling a longtime goal of
dropping the brokerage from its balance sheet.
   After rising 75 cents Tuesday, Shearson stock gained 50 cents to
$11.75 this morning in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Cohen's departure culminated a shakeup of senior management in
recent months brought on by the tough times facing the securities
industry.
   Late last year, then-Shearson president Jeffrey B. Lane left the
firm after he was demoted as part of a series of moves instituted
by his longtime sidekick, Cohen.
   ``They put it together basically,'' said Lawrence Eckenfelder,
an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
``Much of the growth and expansion in the '80s was Peter and Jeff.''
   But Shearson, like other major Wall Stree firms, has suffered
because of a slowdown in business since the October 1987 market
crash. Many analysts believe the firm expanded too far too fast and
now is paying the price.
   Shearson late last year slashed 800 jobs, cut broker
commissions, implemented the senior management shakeup and embarked
on the recapitalization plan designed to raise about $865 million.
   Shearson last week reported 1989 profits of $110 million, up
from $96 million a year earlier, but a third of the profits came
from the sale of a money management unit. Investment banking
revenue, which includes merger advising and securities
underwriting, was down 27 percent.
   Cohen, 43, had been under increasing pressure from American
Express to improve business. Some analysts speculated Cohen's
departure stemmed from American Express Chairman James D. Robinson
III's desire to rein in the brokerage.
   The fall was sudden for a man considered a wonder-boy on Wall
Street, a cigar-smoking strategist described in recent books as a
tough negotiator driven to transform Shearson into a top-flight
firm.
   Cohen may have foreseen his own demise. Asked bluntly during a
presentation to underwriters on the stock offering last week why he
still had his job, Cohen reportedly said: ``If Robinson wants to
punch my ticket he can.''
   In fact, Cohen was replaced as chief executive by Howard L.
Clark Jr., an executive vice president and chief financial officer
at American Express, which owns 61 percent of Shearson. Clark also
was named president.
   Cohen will be replaced as chairman on March 1 by F. Warren
Hellman, general partner of the New York investment banking
boutique Hellman &amp; Friedman, which bought a $75 million block of
voting preferred stock on Jan. 15.
   Analysts have blamed Shearson's recent woes on a massive
expansion spearheaded by Cohen during the mid-1980s. The firm
expanded into dozens of new businesses and its payroll soared to
47,000. Shearson has cut back to about 35,700 employees now, second
behind Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   ``They built up too rapidly. They've got a tremendous excess all
over the place,'' said Perrin Long, who follows the industry for
Lipper Analytical Services.
   Cohen joined one of the firm's predecessors, CWBL-Hayden Stone
Inc., in 1971 and rose through the corporate ranks of the firm that
became known as Shearson Hayden Stone Inc. He was named chief
executive officer in 1983 and chairman one year later.
   Cohen led Shearson's expansion into investment banking in 1984
with the acquisition of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb. He also was
instrumental in the January 1988 acquisition of defunct brokerage
E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. for $962 million, giving Shearson a massive
nationwide network of brokerage outlets.
   But along with Shearson's meteoric rise there were several
notable embarrassments.
   Shearson lost the bidding war for RJR Nabisco Inc., which was
taken over last year for $25 billion by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co., losing out on $200 million in fees in the process.
   Also, Shearson's reputation was sullied last year when a
subsidiary, Boston Co., overstated its income; when the firm had to
write off about $100 million in bad investments in troubled Texas
bank MCorp, and when it backed a hostile bid for Pittsburgh-based
Koppers Co.
   American Express acquired Shearson in 1981 for $360 million.
   Under the new stock offer, Shearson plans to sell 21 million
shares of common stock for $12 a share directly to current
shareholders. American Express would buy about 69 percent of the
new stock and any shares not purchased.
   American Express would reduce its stake in Shearson by offering
Shearson shares as a dividend to American Express stockholders or a
dividend in the form of 100 percent of a spin-off corporation
formed with the Shearson shares.
   The old plan envisioned the sale of 20 million shares to the
public.

   Stock prices continued to advance broadly in
fairly actively trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 20.72 points at
2,563.96 at 11 a.m. EST. An hour earlier, the blue-chip indicator
was up 18.02 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 2 to

471 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 56.95 million shares.
   Wall Street analysts said the dollar's strength and the rise in
the bond market had given the stock market a lift.
   ``There's a good chance the market has finally found a place
from where it will rally,'' said Michael Metz, technical analyst
with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``I think we will see a better tone in the
market from here on out.''
   Theodore Tung, senior vice president with National City Corp. in
Cleveland, said worries about interest rates, which have dampened

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Mixed On Denial Of Gorbachev Quitting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade
following Mikhail Gorbachev's denial of plans to resign as the
Soviet Union's Communist Party chief.
   A report that Gorbachev might resign that position triggered a
sell-off in grain and soybean futures late in yesterday's session
on fears that a change in Soviet leadership could result in fewer
Soviet purchases of U.S. grain.
   With those fears fading this morning, traders refocused on other
factors, including continued rainy weather in the South American
soybean belt and sluggish export demand for wheat and corn.
   The rain in Argentina has been good for the recently planted
soybean crop. The beneficial showers were expected to spread over
the next several days into Brazil, the world's second-largest
soybean producer after the United States.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were { cent lower to \
cent higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.76 a
bushel; corn futures were { cent to 1{ cents lower with March at
$2.37} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2 cents lower with March at
$1.36 a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents lower to \ cent higher with
March at $5.58} a bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while pork futures were mixed with pork bellies
rebounding slightly after three straight days of steep losses.
   Live cattle futures were .05 cent to .23 cent lower with
February at 79.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .28
cent lower with March at 83.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .07
cent lower to .15 cent higher with February at 49.57 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .50 cent higher with February
at 50.95 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled mixed on Tuesday while pork bellies
fell sharply.

<HEAD>New Management Predicts Turnaround in 1991</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saab Automobile AB, a joint venture
with General Motors Corp. launched this month, will turn the corner
into profitability next year and produce a new upscale passenger
car within five years, the company's president predicted Wednesday.
   Saab, formerly a money-losing division of the aerospace and
automotive group Saab-Scania AB, is plagued by a 13 percent
absentee rate and a 20 percent turnover of employees, ''which is
more than any place I've ever seen,'' said David Herman.
   ''That's one of our top priorities ... to reduce both those
numbers. It costs a lot,'' said Herman, who worked for GM for 17
years.
   The new company began operations Jan. 1, after GM bought in on a
50-50 basis for $600 million. GM and Saab-Scania each contributed
$100 million to an operating fund.
   Saab reported losing $200 million in the first nine months of
last year.
   ``By the end of 1991 I hope we will turn the corner into the
black, but it depends on a lot of things. This is a living
business,'' Herman told a news conference.
   He said the GM guaranteed the independence and profile of Saab
will remain intact and it will continue to be marketed separately.
Some components will be produced jointly, he said.
   A new car for the luxury market has gone onto the drawing boards
to compete with the popular West German BMW and the Mercedes 300
series, Herman said.
   Saab sold 110,000 cars last year, 31,000 of them in the United
States. Herman said the Swedish-made car is still in its infancy in
Europe, which will be a major target for the new company.

<HEAD>Stride Rite Suitor Withdraws Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of investors withdrew a $900 million bid
for Stride Rite Corp. after officials of the shoe company turned
down the offer.
   But a spokesman for the investors refused today to rule out
another bid for Stride Rite.
   The investors, led by Walsh, Greenwood &amp; Co., of Greenwich,
Conn., said they were disappointed Stride Rite would not consider
the $32-per-share offer.
   ``We believe that, in today's marketplace, a negotiated
transaction would have been the best way to realize the highest
value for the company's shareholders,'' Walsh Greenwood said in a
letter to Stride Rite.
   ``Your response leaves us no alternative but to withdraw our $32
per share proposal and consider all available options consistent
with our objectives,'' the letter said.
   Stephen Walsh, a managing partner for the firm, declined to
elaborate on the letter, and he refused to say whether his
associates might make another proposal.
   ``We are meeting to discuss all options,'' he said.
   Stride Rite said its board had rejected the offer. Arnold Hiatt,
chairman of the company, said in a statement the directors
determined ``a successful, independent Stride Rite is in the best
long-term interests of Stride Rite's shareholders, employees,
customers and the communities we serve.''
   Stride Rite, the leading children's shoemaker and retailer in
the country, received the buyout offer in December.
   The company makes and sells shoe brands such as Keds and Sperry
Top-Sider and has more than 180 stores and more than 60 shoe
sections in department stores.
   ``We think within those brands, there is a lot of opportunity
for growth,'' said John Phelan, chief financial officer for the
company.
   In particular, Stride Rite noted an increase last year in Keds
sales, which were 43 percent higher than they were in 1988.
   Phelan said the company may have trouble matching that growth in
the future, but he said Stride Rite has been able to boost Keds
sales by catering more to women, and the company also views the
largely untapped men's market as another potential opportunity.

<HEAD>Northwest Announces Five-year Improvement Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines said today it will spend $422
million over the next five years to try to bring more flights in on
time, improve inflight food and redecorate its 300 planes.
   Northwest President Fred Malek said Northwest, the country's
fourth-largest airline, wants to become the first choice of more
travelers by 1995.
   Malek didn't divulge results of market surveys on how Northwest
fares among competitors currently, but said their results were
``not too good.''
   Malek held a news conference in Detroit after briefing a
gathering of Northwest sales personnel on the customer service
improvement plan.
   The plan includes spending $100 million to serve more meals and
add choices to the standard fare. About an equal amount will be
spent to step up maintenance capability and increase spare parts
inventories, cutting down on delays due to mechanical problems,
Malek said.
   Northwest flew 45.7 million revenue passenger miles in 1989,
fourth behind American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air
Lines. A revenue passenger mile represents one paying passenger
flown one mile.
   Northwest has been privately held and hasn't reported earnings
data since Malek, Chairman Alfred Checchi and others acquired it
last year for $3.7 billion.
   For 1988, its last year as a publicly held company, Northwest
reported a net profit of $135 million on revenue of $5.6 billion.

   Stock prices continued to advance broadly in
fairly actively trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 30.63 points to
2,573.87 at noon EST. An hour earlier, the blue-chip indicator was
20.72 points higher.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 7 to
3 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 969 issues up, 422 down and
439 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 86.04 million shares.
   Wall Street analysts said the rise in the bond market and
rebound in corporate junk bonds was helping boost the stock market.
Some takeover issues, such as UAL Corp. stocks, which had been hit
hard by sellers earlier in the week, reversed course and were
helping lead the market higher, traders said.
   ``UAL was the key on the downside yesterday. Today it's the key
on the upside,'' said Hildegarde Zagorski, analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Theodore Tung, senior vice president with National City Corp. in
Cleveland, said worries about interest rates, which had dampened
the market's enthusiasm lately, have now been discounted in both
the stock and bond markets.
   ``As interest rate concerns subside, stocks are doing better,''
Tung said. ``It's all keyed to interest rates.''
   Analysts said the market also has been oversold and was in for a
technical rally.
   ``There's a good chance the market has finally found a place
from where it will rally,'' said Michael Metz, technical analyst
with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``I think we will see a better tone in the
market from here on out.''

<HEAD>Author of Limits on Trade With Soviets Urges Lifting Them</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs to UPDATE with Vanik testimony. Picks up
8th graf pvs `The law ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The author of the biggest U.S. restrictions to
trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe said today that
those restrictions should be waived immediately but not repealed.
   ``The principles of Jackson-Vanik should be solidly retained ...
as a back-up insurance that we will not abandon world leadership on
the issue of human rights,'' former Rep. Charles A. Vanik, D-Ohio,
told the House Ways and Means Committee.
   Vanik, however, disagreed with the Bush administration's
insistence that Moscow make law its recently adopted free
emigration policies before the United States lifts the high tariffs
imposed on Soviet imports.
   President Bush promised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at
the Malta summit in December that if the emigration policies are
made law, Bush would seek a one-year waiver of the Jackson-Vanik
restrictions as part of a new U.S.-Soviet trade agreement the two
leaders hope to sign in June.
   ``I judge the Soviet Union by the deed more than the statute,''
Vanik said of recent Soviet emigration policies. ``The process
appears to be a well-established, non-reversible course.''
   He said U.S. slowness in normalizing trade relations with Moscow
and the newly reincarnated governments of Eastern Europe risks
losing those fledgling free markets to other Western powers such as
Japan, West Germany and Italy.
   House Democrats expressed frustration that the administration
has not moved faster to lower the barriers to expanded trade with
countries behind the crumbling Iron Curtain _ a region one
businessman described as the biggest new market since the opening
of the Americas in the 18th and 19th centuries.
   ``We're worried, we don't see any actual planning for this,''
said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla. ``We don't spot the administration
doing a lot.''
   Business people have favored outright repeal of Jackson-Vanik,
saying they are unwilling to make the type of investments Bush has
called for to rebuild the economies of the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe without better assurance that policies will not be changed
suddenly.
   ``If you think we're going to make investments on the basis of
an 18-month waiver, we're not,'' said John Murphy, chairman of
Dresser Industries in Dallas.
   Vanik, however, predicted that repeal of the 1974 law that he
co-wrote with the late Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., would have ``a
tough time in Congress'' because of 45 years of Cold War
conditioning to distrust the Soviet Union.
   ``It's a matter of political reality,'' he said. ``I think the
rest of America is not yet prepared to consider anything more for
the Soviet Union than a waiver.''
   The law was enacted largely to stop the last proposed
U.S.-Soviet trade agreement initiated by former President Nixon in
1972 and to pressure Moscow to remove restrictions that prevented
Soviet Jews from emigrating to non-communist countries.
   Basically, it prohibits all export credits or credit guarantees
to Soviet bloc countries that restrict emigration. The law also
subjects Soviet bloc exports to the United States to stiffer
tariffs than those applied to other countries.
   Soviet emigration has climbed from just under 2,000 in 1986 to
approximately 195,000 in 1989. American officials acknowledge the
biggest barrier now is limits the United States and other countries
are putting on the number of Soviet immigrants they will accept.
   ``The reasons for Jackson-Vanik no longer exist, but people find
a reason to keep it alive,'' said Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y.
   Meanwhile, Senate Democrats on Tuesday proposed a new
half-billion dollar aid package _ $200 million more than Bush wants
_ to foster emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   The bill, introduced by Sen. Claiborne Pell, R-R.I., chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, would augment $738 million
in aid already approved for Poland and Hungary with $511 million
targeted for Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and
Yugoslavia.
   Pell said he would not be surprised if his proposal is increased
during the legislative process ``in view of the profound interest
of the United States in supporting positive developments in Eastern
Europe.''
   Bush, as part of the fiscal 1991 budget he proposed Monday,
asked for $300 million as a ``special assistance initiative'' for
Soviet bloc nations, including Poland and Hungary.

   Philip Morris Companies Inc. said Wednesday its
profit for the final quarter of 1989 more than doubled while
earnings for the full year rose 26 percent due to strong sales.
   The company, which makes such widely-known products as Marlboro
cigarettes, Miller beer, Oscar Mayer meats and Post cereals, netted
$63 million, or 93 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with
$342 million, or 37 cents, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 29 percent to $11.14 billion from
$8.64 billion.
   For all of 1989, Philip Morris earned $2.94 billion, or $3.18 a
share, compared with $1.39 billion, or $2.51, in 1988. Revenue
totaled $44.75 billion, up 41 percent from $31.74 billion.
   Last year's results included a $179 million pretax charge
reflecting the cost of merging the company's General Foods Corp.
with Kraft Inc. and a $276 million gain from the sale of its
investment in Rothmans International PLC.
   Philip Morris acquired Kraft on Dec. 7, 1988, and Kraft results
are included in the company's consolidated results only since the
date of acquisition.
   Philip Morris reported gains in all its units, particularly in
U.S. tobacco and food operations. Helping increase revenue was the
introduction and expansion of several new products, such as
additional Maxwell House coffee blends, the Jello-O ready-to-eat
pudding snacks and Kraft and Miracle Whip cholesterol-free
mayonnaise.

<HEAD>Crime at Merc Widespread, FBI Testifies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illegal trading was widespread on the floor of
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange during the more than a year that
undercover FBI agents spent posing as commodity traders there, one
of the agents testified.
   Agent Dietrich Volk, testifying Tuesday at a pretrial hearing
involving three indicted traders, said illegal trading was
``systemic and pervasive'' at the Merc.
   Officials at the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, the
world's two largest futures exchanges, have repeatedly said abuses
are not widespread on their trading floors.
   They have characterized the 48 traders and a clerk indicted
since August on charges of defrauding customers as a few bad apples
compared with hundreds of honest traders.
   Volk's testimony in the U.S. District Court hearing marks the
first time that any of the FBI agents who posed as traders at the
Merc and the Board of Trade has commented publicly about the sting
operation.
   The three-day hearing, which is scheduled to end today, was
being held regarding motions filed on behalf of three yen-futures
traders at the Merc: Sam Cali, John Baker and Borbert Bailin.
   The three are seeking to suppress statements they made last
January to government agents implicating themselves and others in
illegal trading activities.
   They contend the government illegally coerced the statements
from them, in some cases at their homes, before they had a chance
to talk with their lawyers.

<TEXT>
   SCI Television Inc. must certify to a federal
bankruptcy judge today that it has lined up the required support
for a debt restructuring plan or face reorganization under court
supervision.
   Judge Helen S. Balick signed an order Tuesday giving SCI until
4:30 p.m. EST today to certify that it has been tendered at least
87.5 percent of its 16{ percent senior subordinated debentures
under an exchange offer.
   As part of its latest plan to restructure its $1.3 billion debt,
the company said a minimum of 87.5 percent of that $100 million
bond issue must be tendered.
   As of 11:30 a.m. EST today, SCI said 77.8 percent of the
debentures had been tendered. It extended the exchange offer until
4:30 p.m. EST.
   If SCI can't meet Wednesday's certification deadline, the judge
said the company would be placed under protection of Chapter 11 of
the federal bankruptcy laws while it reorganizes.
   The judge's ruling appeared to have the support of the company,
representatives of a majority of its bondholders and attorneys for
three bondholders who had filed a petition in November to force SCI
into Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings, which may have resulted in
liquidation of the company.
   ``I don't know of any holder who favors Chapter 11 rather than
the deal,'' said Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc., which is a
financial adviser to a bondholders group.
   He said he was on the phone to as many bondholders as he could
reach on Tuesday, encouraging them to tender their bonds and
advising them that there is no reason to expect any last-minute
changes to sweeten the offer.
   ``My concern is that there may be people out there who have the
incorrect impression that something wonderful is still capable of
happening,'' Ross said. SCI has had trouble generating enough cash
to pay the interest on its debt to bondholders and bank lenders
following two debt-financed transactions in the past five years.
   It owns six television stations that were once part of Storer
Communications, acquired by the buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. in a leveraged buyout in 1985.
   SCI Television was created in 1987 when the Storer television
stations were sold for $1.3 billion to a company in which Nashville
entrepreneur George Gillett owns 55 percent and Kohlberg Kravis
owns 45 percent.
   The company has been negotiating a debt restructuring with its
bondholders and bank lenders since last fall. It recently won
agreement from representatives of a majority of bondholders for a
plan that would give the bondholders a 39 percent equity interest
in SCI and new debt securities.
   Under the plan, bank lenders would get a 5 percent equity stake
while Gillett's stake would fall to 41 percent and Kohlberg's stake
to 15 percent.
   Under the plan, a certain minimum percentage of each of SCI's
three issues of publicly-held bonds have to be tendered. SCI has
met the required minimum on two issues but is still short on the
16{ percent issue.
   ``It has become a huge game of chicken,'' said one person
familiar with the efforts to get bondholders to tender their bonds,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Bondholders are jockeying for position so that only the bare
minimum of 16{ percent bonds are tendered, leaving holders of the
remaining 12.5 percent of the issue eligible for cash interest
payments.
   But the risk under bankruptcy protection, he said, is that
holders of all of the 16{ percent bonds would be given stock and
additional securities in lieu of cash interest payments.

<HEAD>Parent of American Airlines Also a Big Telephone Marketer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Travelers know American Airlines as one
of the nation's most familiar carriers. Few know its parent company
also is engrossed in a telephone marketing operation that does
everything from taking hotel reservations to answering questions
about foreclosed S&amp;L property for sale.
   AMR Information Services Inc., formed four years ago by AMR
Corp., is seen by the parent company as a way to tap the
experience, investment and success of its computer reservations
system, SABRE, the largest in the airline industry.
   The subsidiary's president, Russell J. Harrison, also said it's
aimed partly at cushioning the ups, downs and uncertainties of
running an airline.
   ``An awful lot of what affects the airline industry is out of
control of the airline business,'' Harrison said. For example, he
said, the sharp rise in fuel costs this winter turned a record year
for AMR into disappointment.
   ``With their powerful computer and telecommunications and
reservations resources, it's a natural opportunity or extension to
do some incremental business,'' said Mark Daugherty, who follows
AMR for the Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. investment firm.
   The subsidiary does not yet provide much of a cushion, although
Harrison said it has been profitable since 1987 and has grown about
50 percent a year.
   The idea for it was spawned from an effort to make use of the
time when reservations agents weren't selling airplane tickets.
   What started as a time-filler now has its own computer system,
separate from SABRE, and last year brought in $100 million in
revenues. It is projected to reach $130 million this year.
   AMR, by comparison, had overall operating revenues last year of
$10.48 billion.
   Harrison said he wanted to recreate the same type of
freewheeling business that helped enrich one of his former
employers, Electronic Data Systems Inc. billionaire H. Ross Perot.
   ``It's OK to have fun,'' Harrison said. ``It's OK to laugh and
celebrate.''
   Harrison said employees are encouraged to ask, ``What do you
think we could do if we didn't know we couldn't?''
   The subsidiary's only corporate directive comes from AMR
Chairman Robert L. Crandall, who ``has said `go build me a
business,' '' Harrison said. ``I'm just kind of manufacturing
businesses.''
   It is comprised of eight divisions and accounts for about 4,000
of AMR's 77,000 employees. While some of the businesses are tied to
the airline industry _ such as meeting planning and travel agent
training _ others are not.
   ``The linkage between all these businesses is that they tend to
be transactions over long distances,'' Harrison said during an
interview at his office near the parent's Fort Worth headquarters.
   The largest division is American Airlines Direct Marketing
Corp., which answers the telephone and makes sales calls for a
range of customers.
   Most of those customers are confidential, Harrison said, because
``they want you to think you're talking to one of their
employees,'' when you call for hotel reservations and such. In
reality, the phones are answered by 880 people in a building at
AMR's Centreport office complex south of Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport.
   However, the division recently landed a high-profile contract:
taking calls for the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency
created to bail out the thrift industry. People who called a
toll-free number to order the list of foreclosed properties offered
for sale got an AMR telemarketing agent.
   The subsidiary isn't shy about saying what kind of calls it
doesn't take _ those generated by television ads. ``We do not sell
Ginzu knives or Zamfir records,'' Harrison said.
   Another significant component of the subsidiary is Caribbean
Data Services, located in Barbados and Santo Domingo, where
employees turn written information into computer data.
   About half the work involves culling information from American
Airlines' tickets; the rest is from other companies such as
insurance concern Equicorp, which uses the company to type in
health claims information.
   The paperwork is flown to the Caribbean on American Airlines
jets, the information typed in, and then either fed directly to a
computer or put on computer disks and sent back to the customer.
   Other divisions sell SABRE to other airlines, provide automated
freight tracking systems, operate a hotel reservations system
similar to SABRE or provide computer services for other airlines.
   Another division _ what Harrison calls his ``R&amp;D shop'' _
provides non-airline computer services and information management.
   Harrison realizes his subsidiary would be a likely candidate for
the auction block should AMR be acquired. The parent company was a
target last year of billionaire developer Donald Trump, whose $7.5
billion proposal collapsed in the aftermath of a stock market
plunge in October.
   ``I love being a part of AMR,'' Harrison said, ``but I could run
the company outside.''
   ``We have built the platform for our business on firm, solid
ground and if we are cut lose, we can continue to grow.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House budget director Richard G. Darman
said today the Bush administration is ready to begin serious
negotiations with Congress on developing a bipartisan plan for
reducing the deficit.
   ``We'd be pleased to start at 10 o'clock tonight, after the
president's speech,'' Darman told the Senate Budget Committee,
referring to the State of the Union address.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., reminded Darman that at this time
a year ago, the administration was encouraging such negotiations _
not just expressing a willingness to participate.
   If there has been a change of heart, Darman replied, it is
because ``a couple of very important people have said they don't
want to negotiate.'' He did not identify them but apparently was
referring to some congressional leaders.
   Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget,
expressed frustration that after many hours of criticism from
opponents of the administration's budget policies, ``I have yet to
see ... a detailed plan'' from those critics.
   For the second straight day, the administration's 1991 budget
was hammered by Democratic lawmakers as unrealistic, too heavy on
military spending and dependent on overly optimistic economic
projections. Darman defended the budget and projections, as did
several Republican members of the Senate Budget Committee.
   ``This is the most realistic budget that has been submitted by a
president in five years,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   ``You are not dealing with people who are totally out of
bounds'' in trying to forecast how the economy will behave in the
coming months, Darman said Tuesday.
   Testifying before the House Budget Committee, Darman rejected
criticism from Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the panel,
that the new budget relies on rosy assumptions about unemployment,
inflation and economic growth.
   Darman said the administration compiled ``an amazingly accurate
record'' in making its forecasts last July. ``This represents not
just wisdom but some luck,'' he added.
   Darman noted, for example, the July forecast for growth in the
gross national product last year was 2.9 percent _ exactly what
occurred. OMB economists also were right on the mark on
unemployment (5.2 percent) and interest rates on short-term
Treasury notes (8.5 percent) and came close in predicting inflation
would average 5 percent. The actual figure was 4.8 percent.
   Economic forecasts are a major factor in preparation of a
federal budget. For example, if the inflation rate is higher than
forecast, the deficit could be worsened considerably because many
federal programs, including Social Security, are increased
automatically with the inflation rate.
   The 1991 budget of $1.23 trillion is based on an OMB forecast
that the economy will grow by 3.2 percent during the year, although
the consensus of several private economists is 2.2 percent.
Similarly, the administration projects interest rates on
three-month Treasury bills at 5.4 percent in 1991, compared with a
7.2 percent private forecast.
   Darman spent a considerable part of his time before the House
panel defending the administration's decision not to support a
reduction in Social Security taxes. The hottest topic among members
of Congress is a bill by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., that
would cut those taxes as a way to keep the government from using
surplus Social Security tax collections to pay for other federal
programs.
   ``It is my personal opinion that he never intended the plan to
be taken as seriously as the press has taken it,'' Darman said.
   Panetta interjected: ``I get the impression that he is quite
serious about the proposal.''
   Bush's budget proposes that once the federal deficit is
eliminated _ and predicts that will be in 1993 _ Social Security
taxes that are not needed to pay benefits immediately should be
used only to retire government debt.
   Darman bristled when Rep. James Slattery, D-Kan., said, ``Social
Security is the biggest lie we have told the American people in
maybe this generation.'' Slattery described Bush's proposed remedy
as ``another scam, another scam.''
   ``You're saying ... that (federal) debt is no good, that we are
bankrupt ... The day that ... U.S. treasuries (securities) are no
good is a day I think none of us will ever see,'' Darman said.
   ``Our proposal is not smoke and mirrors,'' he added. ``It will
really get the debt down ... There isn't a trace of dishonesty in
this presentation.''
   Several Democrats on the House committee criticized the
administration's call for $292 billion for the military at a time
of declining East-West tensions. Others lamented proposed cuts in
various social programs.
   The budget, said Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., reflects ``a view
of America that is not shared by a lot of people in my district.''
   The new budget anticipates a $63.1 billion deficit in the 12
months that begin Oct. 1, although congressional economists say the
figure is likely to approach $100 billion. The budget would rely on
spending reductions, user fees and selected tax increases _ but no
general boost in income taxes _ to cut the deficit from the 1990
level of about $124 billion.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was little changed against other major
foreign currencies today in nervous European trading, dealers said.
   Gold prices were slightly lower.
   A rumor that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev was resigning as
Communist Party chief sent the dollar soaring Tuesday in New York
and in Japanese overnight trading.
   Gorbachev denied the rumor this morning, which stemmed the
dollar's rise.
   Traders said the belief that many dealers had overreacted to the
rumors and comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan
that inflation is still a concern in the U.S. would force the
dollar lower.
   ``Even though most people would probably agree the dollar is
currently undervalued, the dominant impression is that the dollar
is on its way down,'' a Milan analyst said. ``Every time it perks
up, people take profits and bring it back down.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.15 yen to a closing 144.40 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 144.25 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.6804 West German marks, down from 1.6805;
1.4890 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.7080 French francs, up from
5.7040; 1.9018 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8880; 1,249.50 Italian
lire, unchanged; and 1.1885 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1902.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6832 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6830 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $417.10 a troy ounce,
down from $418.50 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $417.55.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $417.75, down from $419 bid late
Tuesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell 32 cents to close at a bid $416.03.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.21 a troy ounce, down
from Tuesday's $5.22.

   Prices advanced on London's Stock Exchange
Wednesday after cautious interest from institutional investors
boosted certain stocks.
   Although Wall Street began on an even keel and surged over 34
points higher by the close of the European day, dealers said there
appeared to be a universal reluctance to set foot in the equity
market.
   ``It's a broad-based lack of involvement,'' said one market
maker. ``People just don't trust the rise in New York.''
   With confidence still somewhat shaky, institutional buyers were
selecting stocks with some overseas exposure instead of those with
domestic earnings, dealers said.
   Market watchers said the bulk of the day's trading was done
during the morning session, when a fairly sizeable program trade
was conducted with an evenly balanced amount of buy and sell orders.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 15.3 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,337.3.
   Volume came to 571.9 million shares, compared with 493.7 million
shares Tuesday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midway Airlines Inc. has rejected a request by
Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp. for a seat on the Chicago-based airline's
board of directors, documents disclosed today.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Ampco-Pittsburgh also disclosed it is seeking federal approval to
increase its holdings of Midway's common stock to more than $15
million.
   Last September, Ampco, a Pittsburgh, Pa.-based, heavy
manufacturing concern, disclosed it had acquired a 9.6 percent
stake in Midway.
   On Nov. 13, Ampco made an informal request for representation on
Midway's board. Ampco renewed that request Jan. 2 after a board
member, Jeffrey H. Erickson, resigned.
   But Tuesday, according to the SEC filing, Midway told Ampco that
its request for board representation had been rejected.
   Late last week, Midway elected Frank Reed, president and chief
executive officer of Philadelphia's First Pennsylvania Bank Corp.,
to fill the vacancy.
   Ampco said it is considering what action, if any, it might take
in response to the rejection.
   Ampco also revealed it is seeking antitrust clearnace from the
Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to acquire
additional Midway stock which would result in Ampco's holding more
than $15 million in common stock but less than 15 percent of the
outstanding voting securities of Midway.

   A group of investors said Wednesday it has
scrapped a $900 million takeover bid for The Stride Rite Corp., but
refused to rule out another offer for the leading shoe company.
   ``We are meeting to discuss all options,'' said Stephen Walsh,
managing partner of Walsh, Greenwood &amp; Co., the Greenwich, Conn.,
investment concern that led the takeover effort.
   Stride Rite, based in Cambridge, announced Wednesday it had
turned down the $32-per-share offer. The company said its long-term
interests would be best served by remaining independent.
   The investors sent a letter to Stride Rite, saying they were
disappointed the company would not consider the offer.
   ``We believe that, in today's marketplace, a negotiated
transaction would have been the best way to realize the highest
value for the company's shareholders,'' the letter said.
   ``Your response leaves us no alternative but to withdraw our $32
per share proposal and consider all available options consistent
with our objectives,'' it said.
   Walsh declined to elaborate on the letter, and he refused to say
whether his associates might make another proposal.

<HEAD>Government To Revise Securities Transaction Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Changes in securities laws are being considered
that would protect Japanese companies from sneak attacks from
corporate raiders but at the same time relax some restrictions on
foreign investment, Finance Ministry officials said Wednesday.
   The proposed legislation, to be submitted to Parliament when it
reconvenes in March, would go into effect by the year's end, they
said.
   A new ``5 percent rule'' would require anyone whose holdings
exceed 5 percent of a company's shares to report to the Finance
Ministry, stock exchanges and the company, the officials said.
   The new rule would make stock transactions more visible and
prevent hostile raiders from collecting shares secretly, said
ministry spokesman Tetsuo Kabe.
   Last year, American investor T. Boone Pickens became the largest
single shareholder in Koito Manufacturing Co., an auto parts maker,
when he obtained more than 20 percent of its shares, mostly from a
Japanese stock speculator.
   Pickens has been trying unsuccessfully to gain representation on
Koito's board of directors.
   Experts said that the new legislation would make it more
difficult for speculators to amass big holdings from a third party.
   But the legislation also would ease restrictions on the tender
offer bid _ a public announcement of intent to acquire, at a fixed
price, any or all of a company's securities. Foreign investors have
said the current rules are too strict and curb their investment in
Japan.
   The ministry says there have been only three such bids in 19
years.
   Such bids no longer would require 10 days advance notice to the
ministry, and investors would be allowed 60 days for bidding,
instead of the current 30, officials said.
   Japanese law now requires non-residents to have agents in Japan
for such bids. The new legislation would allow lawyers, accountants
and others, in addition to banks and securities firms, to represent
non-resident investors.
   ``We realized we have to eliminate restrictions such as advance
notice because, among the Western countries, only Japan is imposing
such requirements,'' said another ministry official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``We expect the revised law will encourage
foreign investment in Japan.''
   Kabe said the 5 percent rule's main purpose ``is to prevent wild
fluctuations in share prices.''
   When an investor buys a large number of one company's shares, it
often causes wild price moves.
   Those who fail to report under the new legislation would be
punished with fines or prison terms, although details remain to be
worked out, Kabe added.
   At present, the only reporting requirement is that companies
issuing shares must notify the ministry of major changes in
shareholders holding more than 10 percent of their shares, he said.
   Critics said the revised law may not have much impact on the
market because most stocks are permanently held by business
partners and financial institutions, including major securities and
life insurance companies and banks.
   Financial institutions would be exempted from having to
immediately notify the ministry as long as they did not intend to
gain management rights by increasing their holdings to more than 5
percent of a company's shares, the ministry said.

<HEAD>Texas Group Seeks Controlling Interest in Times</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A minority shareholder group that
includes Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass has offered to buy
controlling interest in the St. Petersburg Times, the newspaper
reported Wednesday.
   David Bonderman of Poynter-Jamison Ventures Limited Partnership
offered $270-million for the outstanding shares in the Times
Holding Co. in a letter Tuesday to Andrew Barnes, editor, chairman
and chief executive officer of the Times.
   The Holding Co. owns controlling stock in the Times Publishing
Co., which owns the Times and its affiliates. The publishing
company publishes the St. Petersburg Times, business magazines
Florida Trend and Georgia Trend, and Congressional Quarterly and
Governing, Washington-based publications.
   Barnes said the companies' boards of directors are scheduled to
meet next week and a formal response would be issued after
deliberations.
   However, Barnes gave his views in a notice to staff at the
paper, which was founded in 1884.
   ``I see no reason to dismantle Nelson Poynter's legacy, which
serves Times readers, this community and journalism across America
and around the world, merely to enrich private investor
interests,'' he said.
   The Times Holding Co. stock is owned by the Poynter Institute
for Media Studies, a local non-profit journalism education
facility, and by Marion K. Poynter, widow of Nelson Poynter, former
owner of the Times.
   The institute owns 2,600 shares; Mrs. Poynter owns 400 shares.
   The Holding Co. controls 3,000 of the outstanding 3,500 shares
of stock in the Times Publishing Co.. The other shares are owned by
the Poynter Institute, 300 shares; and the Poynter-Jamison
Partnership, 200 shares. Five hundred of the shares are voting
shares.
   Nelson Poynter, the newspaper's last individual owner, set up
the institute and left it in control of 300 shares of voting stock.
He then arranged for the company's chief executive officer to vote
the shares, in effect giving the institute control of the Times,
the newspaper said.
   In August 1988, a partnership that includes Bass, Bonderman and
other Bass associates bought the other 200 shares of voting stock
for an undisclosed price from Poynter's nieces, Anne Poynter
Jamison Parker and Mary Alice Jamison Griffin. The nieces are
members of the partnership.
   Dividend income from the institute's stock is used to help
support its educational programs.

   In another sign of hard times on Wall Street,
already troubled Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is extending staff
cuts into the ranks of highly paid investment bankers, sources said.
   Unlike recent layoffs at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the job reductions
at the nation's No. 2 brokerage are being done gradually. They were
planned and some executed before the resignation Tuesday of Peter
A. Cohen as chairman and chief executive.
   One Shearson investment banker who asked not to be named said 50
to 100 professionals, or 10 percent to 20 percent of the force,
could be gone by May. A Shearson official who requested anonymity
called the figure ``way out of line'' but said some reductions had
occurred as part of ongoing business.
   Wall Street analysts said layoffs at Shearson are not surprising
given the firm's ongoing problems and a general slump in mergers
and acquisitions and securities underwriting on Wall Street.
   ``To cut 10 to 20 percent would be consistent with what other
firms have done, so that would not surprise me,'' said Lawrence
Eckenfelder, a securities industry analyst with Prudential Bache
Securities Inc. in San Francisco. ``There's not enough banking
business.''
   Investment bankers generally are regarded as a cut above
stockbrokers and other lower-echelon Wall Street employees. Bankers
are among the most highly paid professionals in the industry with
six- and seven-figure salaries and bonuses.
   According to Securities Data Co., the dollar volume of mergers
and acquitisions completed in the fourth quarter of 1989 declined
36.6 percent from the same 1988 period. Much of the decline is
attributed to the collapse of the market for junk bonds, often used
to finance such deals.
   New issues of corporate equity were down 9.9 percent for the
full year and more than 28 percent since its peak in 1986,
Securities Data said. Debt issues also have slumped.
   Merrill Lynch earlier this month let go about 140 people in its
investment banking division, or about 10 percent, including 70
professionals, spokesman Fred Yager said. Most of the layoffs were
effective immediately.
   Merrill, the nation's largest brokerage, plans about 3,000 total
layoffs this year, including 2,000 by the end of March.
   In recent months, other firms also have scaled back investment
banking as part of an overhaul dating to the 1987 stock market
crash that has reduced securities industry employment by about
35,000 jobs.
   Salomon Brothers Inc. recently announced 100 across-the-board
cuts, with about 20 in investment banking; Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. slashed 300 employees, including 15 bankers; and
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. cut about 20 investment bankers.
   Shearson last week reported that its investment banking revenue
for 1989 sank 27 percent to $963 million and blamed a slowdown in
dealmaking and securities underwriting.
   ``A lot of firms basically bloated these departments in the
expectation that volume was going to increase,'' Eckenfelder said.
``It's a situation where you may have to cut more people
percentage-wise than your business is dropping.''
   At Shearson, investment bankers are being given time to find
other jobs and allowed to remain in their offices as they are
dropped from the payroll, one source said.
   ``There hasn't been the kind of cutting into core that Merrill
had,'' the Shearson banker said Tuesday before Cohen's resignation.
``We're talking about tree-trimming that probably should have been
done anyway.''
   Shearson entered the investment banking field in 1984 with the
acquisition of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb, part of an expansion plan
spearheaded by the departing Cohen.
   It is unclear how the changing of the guard at Shearson will
affect the investment banking division. Some analysts are
predicting further, more drastic cutbacks across the board at the
firm, which slashed 800 jobs in December, lowering its payroll to
35,700.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a slow session that
featured little significant news to move the markets.
   Soybean futures advanced slightly following Mikhail Gorbachev's
denial of a report that he might resign as the Soviet Union's
Communist Party chief.
   That report, which injected uncertainty into all financial
markets Tuesday, had triggered a selloff in grain and soybean
futures on fears that a change in Soviet leadership could result in
fewer Soviet purchases of U.S. grain.
   Wheat futures ended mixed, corn was off slightly and oats rose a
little.
   Analyst Mickey Luth of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said a
6-week-old decline in the soybean market may not be over despite
technical signals of a turnaround earlier in the week.
   He cited prospects for a large South American soybean crop due
to recent beneficial rainfall in Argentina and Brazil.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent lower to } cent higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.75{ a bushel; corn
futures were { cent to 2 cents lower with March at $2.38 a bushel;
oats were 1{ cents to 2\ cents lower with March at $1.35 a bushel;
soybeans were { cent lower to 2\ cents higher with March at $5.60}

   Editor &amp; Publisher, the weekly trade magazine

subscriptions reached an all-time high.
   The renewal rate of 88 percent was contained in the Audit Bureau
of Circulation audit statement for the 12 months ended June 1989,
the magazine said.
   Robert U. Brown, editor and president of E&amp;P, said the
magazine's renewal rate _ the percentage of subscribers who renew
their subscriptions _ has always been in the mid to high 70s. The
magazine's circulation has been audited by ABC since 1914, he said.
   He said the magazine's renewal rate and circulation began to
increase over the past two years. ``We didn't, however, expect such
a high number,'' he said in a statement.
   The magazine said its paid circulation for the year ended June
1989 was 25,097.

<HEAD>Commodore Profit Drops 70 Percent In Second Fiscal Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST CHESTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodore International Ltd.'s profit
decreased 70 percent in the final three months of 1989 as sales of
its less-powerful personal computers dropped, the computer maker
said Wednesday.
   Profit totaled $11.3 million, or 35 cents a share, compared with
$38.2 million, or $1.20 per share, in the same period a year
earlier, Commodore said.
   Sales for the period, which is the company's second fiscal
quarter, declined to $310.7 million, compared with $349 million in
the year-earlier quarter, Commodore said.
   Expenses increased by $15.1 million in the latest quarter as the
company spent more on marketing, Commodore said.
   ``Although our results were below last year's Christmas quarter,
we are encouraged by our return to profitability, strong demand for
the Amiga product line, and increased sales of our professional
PCs,'' said Irving Gould, chairman and chief executive.
   Sales of the Amiga personal computer accounted for more than
half of the company's revenue in the latest quarter, he said.
Commodore's C64, C128D and lower-end personal computer sales were
down, it said.
   Strong growth in European sales was overshadowed by weaker sales
in other areas of the world and the adverse effects of the strong
dollar on foreign exchange, the company said.
   Commodore lost $8.9 million from April through June of 1989 and
$6.5 million from July through September.
   For the last six months of 1989, profit totaled $4.8 million, or
15 cents a share, down from $47.8 million, or $1.50 a share, a year
earlier.

   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. said Wednesday its fourth-quarter
earnings fell 40 percent from a year ago, reflecting efforts to
remain independent from hostile suitor Georgia-Pacific Corp.
   Meanwhile, the 3-month-old takeover battle continued in federal
courtrooms in Maine and Connecticut.
   Great Northern said earnings for the last three months of 1989
totaled $51.9 million, or 92 cents a share, on sales of $934.2
million. That compared with earnings of $85.8 million, or $1.56,
and $944.1 million in sales.
   The Norwalk, Conn., company said earnings were reduced by 33
cents a share due to expenses incurred in fending off Atlanta-based
Georgia-Pacific's $3.8 billion takeover bid.
   Great Northern has gone to court to block the offer and to
thwart Georgia-Pacific's efforts to oust the Great Northern board
of directors at a March 2 special shareholders meeting.
   On Wednesday, the company disclosed documents in federal court
in Portland, Maine, accusing Georgia-Pacific of violating
securities laws by allegedly hiding plans to sell Great Northern's
properties in Maine after a merger. Georgia-Pacific has denied
those allegations.
   Meanwhile, in a court appearance in Bridgeport, Conn., Georgia
Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. denied charges by Great
Northern that a merger of the two companies would create a
monopoly, saying the resulting company would become more
competitive and efficient.
   The combined company would have sales of around $14 billion.
   For the year, Great Northern said it earned $321.1 million, or
$5.78 a share, down 6 percent from $341.7 million, or $6.21, in
1988. Sales rose to $3.86 billion from $3.56 billion.
   Chairman William R. Laidig said softer prices for its lumber and
other wood products also contributed to last year's earnings
decline.
   ``Our performance in 1990 will depend on both the strength of
the U.S. economy and the growth in demand for our products
worldwide,'' he said in a statement.

   The stock market ended sharply higher in fairly
active trading today, reversing a five-session slide.
   Stocks rallied shortly after the opening on what some Wall
Street analysts said was a technical bounce, then moved steadily
higher throughout the session. The Dow Jones industrial average had
fallen more than 72 points since last Wednesday.
   ``What's going on is nothing more than a market that got more
oversold than at anytime since october 1987,'' said Ralph Bloch,
chief market analyst for Raymond, James &amp; Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
   Wall Street analysts said the market also gained strength from a
rallying bond market after recent steep declines. A rebound in
corporate junk bonds also spilled over into the stock market.
Losses by RJR Holdings Capital Inc., which had dragged the junk
bond market lower in recent days and helped pressure takeover
stocks, gained ground for the second day.
   Interest-rate worries, which had plagued the market in recent
days, also subsided, thanks in part to today's report by the
Commerce Department that the December index of leading indicators
went up 0.8 percent. Consensus expectations were for a rise of
about 0.5 percent.
   The index, composed of 11 statistics designed to forecast
economic activity six to nine months into the future, was the
latest indication that the economy, while weak, can avoid an actual
decline in growth _ or recession.
   ``As interest rate concerns subside, stocks are doing better,''
said Theodore Tung, senior vice president with National City Corp.
in Cleveland. ``It's all keyed to interest rates.''

   Oilworkers rejected the industry's two-year
contract offer Wednesday and threatened to strike some or all of
the nation's largest petroleum companies.
   The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union said
the contract offered by Amoco Corp., the pattern contract for the
industry, fell short on pay, health benefits and environmental
concerns. The company had no comment.
   Walkouts could be called at individual oil companies, the union
said.
   ``It is our intention to extend the bargaining agreement on a
24-hour rolling basis,'' said union vice president Robert Wages,
referring to the contract set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Thursday.
   The negotiations affect about 40,000 domestic oil workers and
300 contracts.
   Wages said negotiations will continue, but major companies that
could be struck include Amoco, Texaco, Chevron, Mobil, Shell,
Atlantic Richfield and Unocal.
   The average refinery worker's wage now is $15.18 an hour.
   The union seeks $1.25 hourly wage increases in each year of the
two-year pact, increasing companies health care premium
contributions to 90 percent, establishing an independent
environmental monitor at each plant, and industry support of
legislative efforts to establish a national health plan modeled
after Canada's.
   Wages said the Amoco offer included annual pay raises of 62-64
cents an hour; increases in family medical premiums of $45 the
first year and $40 the second; and failed to address both the
environmental monitor and national health care proposals.
   Talks began Jan. 1. Last September, the union's national
bargaining committee came up with a seven-point program which was
ratified by the rank and file. That ratification also gave the
committee strike authorization.

   The Washington Post Co. switched the listing
of its Class B common stock on Wednesday from the American Stock
Exchange to the New York Stock Exchange.
   About 7,000 shares of the stock were traded on its first day on
the NYSE, and it rose to $270.75 a share, up $2.25 from its close
Tuesday on the Amex.
   The company, which owns the Washington Post newspaper and
Newsweek magazine, applied for a listing on the NYSE, the nation's
largest stock exchange Jan. 19. It has has 10.59 million Class B
shares outstanding.
   Company spokesman Guyon Knight said Washington Post Co. has
nearly 1.9 million shares of Class A common, which are owned by
Katharine Graham, the board chairman, and her family and are not
traded publicly. The Class A shares have a weighted voting power
and elect 70 percent of the board while Class B shares elect 30
percent.
   When the Washington Post Co. went public in 1971, the NYSE did
not list companies with dual classes of stock with different voting
rights, Knight said.
   ``Since that restriction has been removed, the company
determined its interest and those of its shareholders would best be
served by moving to the Big Board,'' he said.
   In addition to the Post and Newsweek, the company owns
television stations in Detroit, Hartford, Conn., and Jacksonville,
Fla., and a cable television division which serves approximately
415,000 customers in 15 states.

   The energy futures market turned mixed in
lackluster trading Wednesday, with wholesale heating oil and
gasoline prices dropping sharply and crude oil posting gains.
   The contract for February delivery of No. 2 home heating oil
lost 1.64 cents to settle at 58.87 cents a gallon on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, after declining 0.60 cent Tuesday.
   February unleaded gasoline, which fell 0.90 cent Tuesday,
dropped another 1.02 cents to close at 61.71 cents a gallon.
   However, the March contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, gained 22 cents to settle at $22.68
per 42-gallon barrel. The near-month contract lost 34 cents in
Tuesday's session.
   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc., said traders sold heating oil and gasoline contracts
following a report late Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute
that showed higher-than-expected inventories of those products last
week.
   Beutel said crude prices rose as a result. ``There was buying in
crude against the sale in heating oil and gasoline,'' he said.

   The Rockefellers have sold control of the
Manhattan landmark bearing their name to a Japanese firm, and
several grandchildren of Campbell Soup Co.'s founder want that
company auctioned to strangers.
   You might ask how they can they sell the family businesses _
especially those with famous names. As time goes on, it becomes
easy.
   Emotional ties to a family-owned firm, hatched from scratch and
sweat by entrepreneurial ancestors, can weaken with each passing
generation until the company's asset value outweighs its
sentimental value and the corporation becomes an albatross to its
owners.
   For $846 million, the Rockefellers turned over a controlling
interest in Rockefeller Group Inc. to Mitsubishi Estate Co. In
relinquishing control, the Rockefellers parted with New York's
Rockefeller Center, the most visible and tangible symbol of their
family fortune, and also surrendered exclusive rights to the
Rockefeller name.
   Meanwhile, three grandchildren of Campbell founder John T.
Dorrance Sr. have split with other relatives and want the company
sold. The dissident Dorrances, while their names aren't emblazoned
on soup cans, also are willing to sever their connection with a
brand name familiar to millions worldwide.
   In some ways, the Rockefellers and Dorrances are like many other
heirs of successful business entrpreneurs. Having grown away from
the family company, they want to take their inheritance and move on.
   David Rockefeller Jr. is the great-great grandson of John D.
Rockefeller and the great-grandson of John D. Jr., the founder of
Rockefeller Center. He said recently that his generation has its
own priorities.
   ``I don't know how far the family, as individuals, would have
wanted to go if they had been asked to pump capital funds into
keeping up these buildings, compared to supporting charitable
causes or pursuing their own careers,'' Rockefeller said in an
interview in the magazine Manhattan Inc.
   ``Frankly, I'm not so sure that if it came down to that, that
they would have said, `The way we want to spend our money is to
buff up the marble down at the Center,'' Rockefeller was quoted as
saying. He refused to be interviewed for this story.
   It's nothing new for the descendants of a company founder to
sell off the family business and its well-known name _ the Fields
of Chicago did it twice.
   Marshall Field III, grandson of retailer Marshall Field, sold
the family's famous department store in 1941, and turned instead
toward journalism, building the Field Enterprises Inc. media empire.
   But more than 40 years later, in 1983, Marshall III's own
grandsons, Marshall Field V and Frederick Field, dissolved the
second family company after a dispute and went separate ways.
   Marshall Field V's current holdings include Field Corp., which
owns Funk &amp; Wagnalls Inc. and other publishers. Frederick Field is
among the investors in the group that bid recently for BAT
Industries PLC, the British conglomerate with properties that
ironically include Marshall Field.
   On the other hand, the Philadelphia-based department store
company Strawbridge &amp; Clothier, founded in 1868, is still
controlled by the Strawbridge and Clothier clans. Just about all
other big department stores across the country have long since been
sold off by their founding families.
   Strawbridge &amp; Clothier also has dealt with dissident relatives
who wanted out. In 1984 a group of Strawbridges decided to sell
their 17 percent stake. The company, facing a takeover, bought the
shares to retain family control.
   Even in some of the biggest corporations, founding family
descendants are active. Nearly 190 years after DuPont Co. was
created, members of the DuPont family still have ties to the
chemical company. Several are board members.
   In 1988, two great-grandsons of Ford Motor Co. founder Henry
Ford became the first of their generation elected to the board of
the automaker, still 40 percent owned by the Ford family. Both men
are also Ford executives.
   Some families have reasserted total control over their
businesses. Southland Corp.'s founding Thompson family, for
example, took the company private in a 1987 takeover, borrowing
money to repurchase the stock.
   Other families who preside over publicly held corporations want
to be sure they maintain control over their companies. So they've
issued different classes of stock with voting rights that puts most
power in family hands.
   Such an arrangement helped the Bryan family that owns Media
General Inc. defeat a takeover bid by investor Burt Sugarman in
1988. The family held about 71 percent of the company's Class B
shares, which controlled six of the nine seats on the Media General
board, allowing the family to easily defeat Sugarman's attempt to
win the other seats.
   But sometimes, when a company is losing money, a family must
choose the bottom line over emotional ties. In 1982 E.W. Scripps
Co. decided to sell United Press International, which had been
losing money for years.
   UPI was a project of company founder E.W. Scripps, who believed
in 1907 that American newspapers needed competing wire services.
Scripps Co. executives and members of the Scripps family decided 75
years later the subsidiary's losses were too much to carry any
longer.
   Ted Scripps, an E.W. Scripps grandson who shared his ancestor's
belief in competition among the wires, lobbied against a sale and
sought a way for Scripps Co. to keep UPI. But relatives told Ted
Scripps the family couldn't afford it.
   There are times when a company can become the pawn in a family
feud. That was the case in the Field family and in the notorious
1980s fight among members of Kentucky's Bingham family, owners of a
media empire.
   It began when Sallie Bingham challenged her brother as head of
the family business and then found herself off the board of
directors. After two years of bickering _ including a threat by Ms.
Bingham to sell her 15 percent stake _ her father, patriarch Barry
Bingham Sr., put an end to the fight and the family ties to the
business, selling its two newspapers, television station and
printing company.
   Bingham, who died in 1988, was forced to break his bonds with
newspapers his father bought in 1918.
   ``It is not easy for me to see The Courier-Journal and
Louisville Times pass from my family into other hands,'' he said in
announcing the sale in May 1986.
   But, he added, ``Change is an inevitable rule of life.''

$5,000 to be auctioned on Tuesday;
   _$10 billion in 10-year notes in minimum denominations of $1,000
to be auctioned on Wednesday, and
   _$10 billion in 30-year bonds in minimum denominations of $1,000
to be auctioned on Thursday.
   These notes and bonds are regularly sold during the large debt
auctions which are held four times a year.

<HEAD>Consumers Losing Confidence in Economic Prospects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A widely watched gauge of consumer confidence
sank in January for the third straight month, dropping to the
lowest point since after the October 1987 stock market crash,
according to a survey released Wednesday.
   The Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index tumbled
to 105.1 in January from 113 in December and 115.8 in January a
year earlier.
   Fabian Linden, executive director of the New York-based business
research group's consumer research center, said ``the size of the
decline must be regarded as a possible, though not unmistakable,
indication of economic troubles ahead.''
   He noted, however, that ``in the context of the survey's
history, the present level of consumer confidence does not yet
signal a likely recession in the coming months.''
   The January reading was the lowest since the index registered
100.8 in November 1987, the month after world financial markets
suffered major setbacks. On Oct. 19, 1987, the Dow Jones industrial
average of 30 blue-chip stocks plummeted 508 points to 1,738.74, a
loss of 22.6 percent of its value.
   A monthly survey of 5,000 households throughout the country
indicated that people are less comfortable with their situations
and less optimistic about the next six months than they were when
polled in December, the Conference Board said.
   The latest poll showed 18.5 percent of all those responding
expressed the view that business conditions were bad, a slightly
larger percentage than in December.
   Only about one in four respondents believed that jobs were
``plentiful,'' a figure that has been going steadily lower in
recent months. On the employment outlook, pessimists outnumbered
optimists for the first time since late 1987.
   Expectations about economic conditions in the next half-year
have deteriorated, the board said. Only 16.2 percent of the
respondents thought that business would improve, down about 2
percentage points from December.
   Buying plans didn't show much change in the January survey. The
percentage of people planning to buy a car fell slightly to 6.9
percent. There still was strong interest in purchasing major
appliances while the number of people planning to buy homes barely
budged from its low level of 3.4 percent.
   The survey is conducted for the board each month by National
Family Opinion of Toledo, Ohio.

<HEAD>Simmons Makes New Move on Georgia Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dallas takeover investor Harold Simmons, who has
coveted the Georgia Gulf Corp. for months, on Wedneday announced a
cash offer to its stockholders that values the Atlanta-based
chemical company at $1.1 billion.
   NL Industries, the Houston-based chemical supplier controlled by
Simmons, said it intends to begin within five business days a
tender offer to buy all outstanding shares of Georgia Gulf at $45
cash each. The company has about 24.5 million shares outstanding,
which includes NL's own 9 percent stake.
   Wall Street welcomed the Simmons announcement. On the New York
Stock Exchange, Georgia Gulf jumped $4.62{ a share to close at
$40.87{.
   Georgia Gulf has been seeking ways to avoid Simmons, a wealthy
investor known for his takeover forays. For awhile the company
beckoned other potential buyers in attempt to raise its stock price
and discourage him.
   In November it abanded those efforts and said it would attempt a
debt-financed recapitalization that would give shareholders cash
and new stock. The company valued that deal as worth about $55 a
share.
   But NL said in its statement Wednesday that it decided to pursue
the acquisition of Georgia Gulf because of the ``belief that under
current market conditions, Georgia Gulf's recapitalization plan
will not provide its shareholders with values as great as $45 per
share.''
   NL said it would seek the support of Georgia Gulf's board of
directors, and would encourage Georgia Gulf management to
``participate in the acquisition transaction.''
   Analysts have said the large stock holdings of Georgia Gulf's
management could make takeover of the company difficult without
management's cooperation.
   Company officials declined to comment on NL takeover offer.

<HEAD>Kimberly-Clark Sends Out Letters Opposing Wisconsin Diaper Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SOLOMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kimberly-Clark Corp., one the nation's largest
diaper makers, said Wednesday it has begun a letter campaign urging
parents in Wisconsin to fight a proposed environmental tax on
disposable diapers.
   Jean Allen, director of corporate communications at
Kimberly-Clark's headquarters in Irving, Texas, said the company
last week sent out 100,000 letters to parents of young children in
Wisconsin.
   The letters urge opposition to a bill pending in the Wisconsin
Legislature that calls for a 1-cent-per-diaper tax to raise money
for recycling efforts in the state.
   ``Kimberly-Clark favors Wisconsin efforts to recycle,'' Ms.
Allen said. ``But to be fair we think such a tax should be levied
on all product that go in landfills. ... We believe it should be a
more broad-based, equitable tax.''
   Ms. Allen said other states also are reviewing recycling
legislation that could affect diapers, but this is the first time
her company, which commands about a 30 percent share of the
nation's disposable diaper market, has campaigned to oppose such a
bill.
   ``We are very concerned that people understand the ramification
of this part of the bill. Once informed it's then their decision on
what action they should take,'' she said.
   But Rep. Spencer Black, D-Madison, the Assembly sponsor of the
recycling bill, said he believed Kimberly-Clark does not support
any tax to help recycling despite its statement.
   ``This is typical of the special interest effort to kill the
recycling bill,'' Black said. ``Every special interest says `we're
for recycling' but then they're against the portion of the bill
that affects their profits.''
   The Wisconsin diaper tax is included in an amendment to a
recycling bill pending before the Legislature's Joint Finance
Committee. The amendment was considered a compromise on an earlier
proposal to ban disposable diapers entirely from Wisconsin
landfills.
   Supporters say the tax is justified because disposable diapers
are not considered biodegradable and do not decay easily when
buried in landfills. A legislative study estimated the tax would
cost a family with a young child $80 to $100 a year in additional
costs.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Skid on U.S. Call for IMF Use of Gold Holdings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices tumbled Wednesday amid reports that the
United States has asked the International Monetary Fund to consider
using its gold holdings to wipe out past-due loans to some of its
member countries.
   Traders feared that such a plan could lead to sales of several
million ounces of gold on the open market.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures were mixed; livestock
and meat futures were lower; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $5.70 to $6.40 lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in February off
$5.70 at $412.40 a troy ounce.
   Silver futures followed gold, ending 1.1 cents to 1.7 cents
lower with March at $5.228 a troy ounce.
   The first report about the IMF said the United States had
proposed the 152-nation lending agency sell $4 billion worth of
gold to obtain cash needed to offset about $4 billion in delinquent
loans to 15 of its poorer members.
   That report prompted heavy selling of gold futures, analysts
said.
   A Treasury Department source told The Associated Press that the
actual proposal was that the IMF ``consider mobilizing'' a portion
of the IMF gold holdings contributed by the delinquent members,
amounting to less than 3 percent _ or about $1.23 billion _ of the
103 million ounces held by the IMF.
   The source, who requested anonymity, would not elaborate on what
``mobilizing'' meant.
   Market analysts said the United States probably was proposing to
use gold as collateral to obtain loans from central banks to cover
the past-due loans.
   Still, said metals economist Fred Demler of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., ``even if you use it as collateral, a default could
end up being a gold sale.''
   Analysts said the gold market's weakness also reflected
Wednesday's strong rally in the stock market and the prospects for
steady, rather than lower, interest rates.
   Petroleum futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in quiet trading.
   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc., said traders sold heating oil and gasoline contracts
following a report late Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute
that showed higher-than-expected inventories of those products last
week.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 22 cents
higher with March at $22.68 a barrel; heating oil was .13 cent to
1.64 cents lower with February at 58.87 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.02 cents lower to .40 cent higher with February at
61.71 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange with much of the selling linked to weaker spot markets and
to positioning by cattle traders ahead of Friday's semi-annual
Agriculture Department cattle inventory report.
   The report is expected to show a continued modest growth in the
nation's cattle herd.
   Live cattle futures settled .30 cent to 1.05 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in February at 79.35 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .20 cent to .75 cent lower with March at 82.52
cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .72 cent lower with
February at 48.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .12 cent
to .45 cent lower with February at 50.45 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures ended mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade with soybeans up, corn down and wheat nearly unchanged.
   Wheat settled { cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $3.75}
a bushel; corn futures were \ cent to 1} cents lower with March at
$2.38\ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2\ cents lower with March at
$1.35\ a bushel; soybeans were \ cent lower to 2{ cents higher with
March at $5.61 a bushel.

   The dollar slipped against most key currencies
in thin trading Wednesday after the markets discounted a report
that Mikhail Gorbachev would resign as Soviet Communist Party
chairman.
   U.S. gold prices dropped sharply on reports that the Treasury
had proposed a $4 billion gold sale by the International Monetary
Fund to strengthen the lending agency's finances. But the Treasury
said later it had only proposed that the IMF consider using gold as
collateral for loans.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, a troy ounce of gold fell
$5.70 to close at $412.40. Republic National Bank later quoted a
bid of $411.25 a troy ounce, down $7.05 from Tuesday.
   The dollar closed mixed against other major currencies in
European trading, affected by uncertainty over Soviet politics,
Japanese central bank intervention and domestic inflation.
   Foreign exchange dealers said traders sold dollars after they
discounted the report about Gorbachev. The report Tuesday by Cable
News Network sent the dollar sharply higher that day.
   There also was pressure on the dollar due to dollar-selling by
the Bank of Japan and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's
comments Tuesday that inflation was still a concern in the United
States.
   In New York, currency traders said there was little reaction to
the Commerce Department's release Wednesday morning of its leading
indicators figure for December. The figure, regarded as the
government's main economic forecasting gauge, jumped a strong 0.8
percent, indicating the economy may avoid a recession this year.
   Walter Simon, a vice president in the New York office of Bank
Julius Baer &amp; Co. of Switzerland, said traders expected the robust
figure after Greenspan's remarks Tuesday. He said the dollar traded
in a narrow range most of the day.
   He said there is a belief that despite the leading indicators
figure and Greenspan's comments, the U.S. economy is weakening.
That belief hurts the value of the dollar because it implies the
Fed will act to ease interest rates, which tends to lower the value
of the dollar.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 144.40 Japanese yen, up from
143.25 on Tuesday. In London late Wednesday the dollar closed
higher at 144.45 yen. In New York it closed at 144.45 yen, down
from 144.65 yen late Tuesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6870 late Wednesday, more
expensive for buyers than Tuesday's late $1.6830. Later, in New
York, it sold for $1.6792, up from $1.6725 Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday
rates: 1.6848 West German marks, down from 1.6990; 1.5010 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5005; 5.7250 French francs, down from 5.7600;
1,251.75 Italian lire, down from 1,260.50; and 1.1870 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1865.
   Other dollar late rates in Europe compared with late Tuesday:
1.6800 marks, down from 1.6805; 1.5025 Swiss francs, up from
1.4890; 5.7275 French francs, up from 5.7040; 1.8950 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8880; 1,252.75 Italian lire, up from 1,249.50;
1.1856 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1902.
   Gold bullion in London traded late at a bid $413.25 a troy
ounce, down from $418.50 late Tuesday. The Zurich late bid price
was $412.50, down from $419.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $417.85 bid, down from
$418.15 on Tuesday.
   Silver prices were unchanged to lower. On New York's Comex,
silver bullion for current delivery finished at $5.194 a troy
ounce, down from $5.207 Tuesday. Earlier, in London, silver bullion
traded $5.22, unchanged.

<HEAD>Announces $422 Million, Five-year Improvement Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines will spend $422 million over
the next five years to lure customers with new plane interiors,
more choices of food and more on-time arrivals, airline President
Fred Malek said Wednesday.
   The nation's fourth-largest airline, already experimenting with
German and Thai dishes on some flights, will spend about $100
million to serve meals on more flights and add choices to standard
in-flight fare, Malek said.
   Northwest also will spend about $100 million to put more
powerful engines on some Boeing 747 jumbo jets, strengthen
maintenance capability and build up spare parts inventories to cut
mechanical delays, he said.
   Malek and Chairman Alfred Checchi, who with other investors
acquired Northwest last August for $3.7 billion, have said they
want it to be the first choice of travelers by 1995.
   Malek wouldn't detail how Northwest rates in market surveys, but
said its performance is ``not too good.''
   The new management is working to boost employee morale, said
Malek, who was formerly president of Marriott Hotels and is
co-chairman of Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, a leading real
estate services company.
   ``It is now time to couple this with some meaningful
improvements in our levels of service,'' he said.
   Malek predicted a consolidation of the airline industry and said
Northwest wants to take part, either through acquisitions or joint
ventures, though he said it hasn't any immediate targets in sight.
   Besides improved meals, maintenance capability and enticements
such as free drinks and headsets for trans-Atlantic passengers,
Northwest will spend $80 million to refurbish its 324 planes, Malek
said.
   Executive class passengers will have wider seats in the
airline's Boeing 747 jumbo jets. Window rows will still be two
seats wide, but center tiers will be three rather than four seats
wide.
   All planes will be redecorated. Uniforms for pilots, flight
attendants and other employees will be redesigned, Malek said.
   Northwest leads the industry in trans-Pacific flights, which can
be 13 to 14 hours long, Malek said. ``That's a long trip. You want
a tranquil, comfortable, pleasing decor package.''
   Flight attendants will be added on some flights, he said, and
the airline will spend $30 million over the five years to clean
planes more often. He didn't elaborate on how the airline will
allocate the remaining $110 million.
   Malek held a news conference in Detroit, Northwest's largest
hub, after briefing an annual conference of the airlines' sales and
marketing staff on the customer service plans. Northwest is based
in Eagan, Minn., a suburb of St. Paul.
   The airline flew 45.7 million revenue passenger miles in 1989,
fourth behind American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta
Airlines, and had a more than 11 percent market share among U.S.
airlines, spokesman Bob Gibbons said.
   The airline is privately owned and hasn't reported sales and
earnings since Malek, Checchi and the others acquired it. In 1988,
its last year as a publicly held company, it reported earnings of
$135.1 million on revenues of $5.65 billion.

<HEAD>Approves Mitsubishi-Backed Takeover Bid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Aristech Chemical Corp.'s board
Wednesday approved a $934.2 million cash takeover bid submitted by
a group of the Pittsburgh company's senior managers and the
Mitsubishi Corp. of Japan.
   But the agreement also allows the company to solicit proposals
from others.
   Utah chemical magnate Jon Huntsman asked Aristech to extend its
bidding deadline from Monday to Feb. 14 to give him time to put
together a bid worth at least $934.2 million, or $27 a share, with
help from General Electric Co.'s GE Plastics division.
   Under terms of the agreement, a cash tender offer will begin
within five days for all of Aristech's outstanding common shares,
Aristech spokesman David Higie said. Aristech stock rose $1.12{
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange to close at $26.37{.
   Aristech will pay Mitsubishi and the management group, headed by
Aristech Chairman Thomas Marshall, up to $13 million in expenses if
their deal falls through, according to the agreement.
   Huntsman on Wednesday said he would study the agreement
carefully over the next few days.
   ``We are very disappointed with the manner in which Aristech's
board of directors proceeded in this instance,'' he said in a
statement released by spokeswoman Leslie Cotten.
   Ms. Cotten declined to comment on whether Huntsman plans to
continue pursuing his own bid.
   Plans call for Marshall's group to to buy about 12.5 percent of
the common stock of a new holding company of which Aristech will be
a subsidiary. Another 8.5 percent will be granted to members of the
management group in restricted common stock.
   A broader group of Aristech management will have the opportunity
to participate up to a total of about 11.5 percent in common stock
equity of the holding company, which can be earned through
performance incentives over a five-year period.
   Financing for the transaction has been arranged through The
Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. and the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.
   Aristech said it will maintain operations in their present form
and locations and keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh under the
arrangement.
   No other details of the transaction were released.
   ``Our management will be freed from the pressures of
quarter-to-quarter performance and will be able to concentrate more
fully on long-term planning, expansion and growth,'' Marshall said.
   Aristech makes and markets polymers and related products and
industrial chemicals. It employes 1,850 people in Arkansas,
California, Florida, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and West
Virginia.
   Huntsman's earlier bid of $25 a share was rejected in November
as inadequate. He owns the nation's largest privately held
chemicals company and currently owns 8.7 percent of Aristech's
stock, spokeswoman Joele Frank said.

   Lower chemical prices cut Dow Chemical
Co.'s fourth-quarter earnings by nearly a third, the company said
Wednesday.
   Even with the decline, earnings for all of 1989 were up 5.5
percent, the company said.
   Dow reported earnings of $427 million, or $1.59 a share, for the
three months ended Dec. 31, down from $635 million, or $2.29 a
share, for the fourth quarter of 1988.
   Quarterly sales totaled $4.26 billion, down from $4.30 billion a

   For the year, Dow reported earnings of $2.49 billion, or $9.20 a
share, on sales of $17.60 billion, vs. earnings of $2.40 billion,
or $8.51 a share, on sales of $16.68 billion in 1988.
   Prices for Dow's chemical products were down nearly 9 percent
from record highs during product shortages a year earlier, the
company said.
   In addition, Dow said the North American construction market
that extensively uses vinyl chloride products slowed, contributing
to a 26 percent drop in income in the category of chemicals and
performance products.

<HEAD>Xerox Reports Fourth-Quarter Earnings of $212 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. on Wednesday reported
fourth-quarter earnings of $212 million, rebounding from the same
period in 1988 when it reported a $77 million loss due to a
restructuring program.
   The profit in the most recent quarter amounted to $1.93 per
share, compared with a loss of 80 cents a share a year earlier.
   Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $4.7 billion, up 6
percent from $4.4 billion in the year-earlier quarter.
   David T. Kearns, Xerox's chairman and chief executive officer,
credited the growth in earnings to successful new products, cost
control measures and benefits from the restructuring program, which
involved a reduction in manufacturing capacity and the elimination
of certain business lines.
   ``Assuming a reasonable economic environment, we expect
full-year benefits of our restructuring program and continued
customer acceptance of our new products to deliver good growth and
improved returns in document processing,'' Kearns said.
   ``Overall corporate results, however, may be somewhat dampened
by the effects of a continuation of the current industrywide
pricing weakness in property and casualty insurance,'' he said.
   The company's insurance and financial services division reported
a slight drop in earnings, from $48 million in the fourth quarter
of 1988 to $43 million in 1989, and from $240 million for all of
1988 to $216 million for 1989.
   The company blamed the earnings drop on soft markets for
property and casualty insurance.
   Overall for 1989 Xerox reported income of $704 million, or $6.41
per share, on revenue of $17.6 billion. In 1988, the company
reported earnings of $388 million, or $3.49 per share, on revenue
of $16.4 billion.
   Excluding the impact of the $244 million restructuring program,
the company's 1988 earnings were $632 million, or $5.88 per share.

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. took steps Wednesday
to bolster its financial footing under tighter control of parent
American Express Co. following the sudden resignation of Shearson
chairman Peter A. Cohen.
   The departure of Cohen, a cigar-chomping Wall Street wunderkind,
typified the faltering fortunes of the nation's second-largest
brokerage and of the securities industry, which is mired in a
protracted slump following the booming 1980s.
   Nine years after acquiring Shearson, American Express removed
the final high-level link to the firm's past when company chairman
James D. Robinson III asked Cohen to leave amid mounting acrimony
between the two executives.
   American Express and Shearson on Wednesday jointly announced a
plan to raise about $250 million by offering stock to existing
shareholders. It replaces a public offering scrapped because of the
firm's slumping stock price and Cohen's resignation Tuesday.
   Under the new plan, American Express would cut its stake in
Shearson to about 45 percent from 61 percent, enabling it to drop
the brokerage from its balance sheet. American Express would remain
Shearson's largest stakeholder.
   A sign of tighter parental control came with the appointment of
Howard L. Clark Jr., chief financial officer and executive vice
president of American Express, as Shearson's new president and CEO.
Clark's father was American Express chairman before Robinson.
   Clark said in a telephone interview that his short-term goal
``is to get out and see the employees and management and retail
system. I will be doing a lot of that. Longer term is to restore
Shearson to its prior levels of returns.''
   He said his appointment would not mark a radical change in the
relationship between American Express and Shearson. Analysts had a
different view.
   ``Basically, they're running the company directly now,'' said
Lawrence Eckenfelder, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. ``Robinson always had influence but it was Peter Cohen's
company.''
   Shearson's current troubles stem in part from a recession on
Wall Street stemming from a decline in individual stock activity,
mergers and acquisitions and securities underwriting. Because of
their size and exposure in many areas, Nos. 1 and 2 Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. and Shearson have been among the hardest hit.
   But analysts lay much of the blame on overexpansion. Shearson
moved from a medium-sized retail outfit to a diversified brokerage
by acquiring investment banking firm Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb in
1984 and retail brokerage E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. in 1988.
   ``In this drive to become a major, global, full-service firm,
they like Merrill expanded to the point where they started to
realize diminishing returns,'' Eckenfelder said. ``They found out
you can be all things to all people but you can't always make money
doing it.''
   For Cohen, 43, described as a tough negotiator driven to
transform Shearson into a top-flight firm, the fall was swift.
   Last week, he offered a hint of his own demise and of his soured
relationship with Robinson. Asked bluntly during a stock-offering
presentation why he still had his job, Cohen said: ``If Robinson
wants to punch my ticket he can.''
   He did. American Express officials say the company now will
focus on assessing what problems need to be resolved. They do not
rule out a sharp consolidation following the '80s growth.
   ``Shearson will be adapting to the demands and requirements of
the environment,'' said Lawrence Armour, an American Express senior
vice president. ``Shearson is really filled with talented,
high-energy people,'' he said. ``I don't think long-range planning,
strategic thinking is one of the things they shine at.''
   Securities industry analysts said Clark is the antithesis of the
brash and combative Cohen. An investment banker in the 1970s,
Clark, who turns 46 on Thursday, was described as a subdued and
practical manager expected to run Shearson less aggressively than
Cohen.
   ``Over the next several years you could see a swing back to the
Shearson of old where the main concern was the retail side of the
business,'' said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical Services.
   The first order of business is the new stock offer. Shearson
plans to sell 21 million shares of common stock for $12 a share to
current shareholders. American Express would buy about 69 percent
of the new stock and any shares not purchased. The old plan
envisioned the sale of 20 million shares to the public.
   Shearson stock reacted positively to the developments, rising 75
cents to $12 in New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday after a
75-cent rise on Tuesday spurred largely by Cohen's resignation.
   American Express would reduce its stake in Shearson by awarding
Shearson shares to American Express stockholders as a special
dividend.
   As it moves forward, Shearson still faces the expansion problems
left behind by Cohen, including the merger with Hutton, the
securities industry's largest ever.
   Analysts and American Express officials say Shearson paid too
much for Hutton _ $962 million _ when retail brokering was slumping
after the stock market crash in 1987.
   In addition, Shearson must patch up morale among its merged
troops, particularly its 10,500 stockbrokers. John Feloni, a former
Hutton executive who wrote a book about the merger, said Hutton's
trademark was that of a friendly retail brokerage while Shearson
symbolized the arrogance characterizing the '80s takeover craze.
   ``It was just a culture clash,'' said Feloni, who now runs his
own small investment firm. ``If there were better times I think
they might have overcome all that. Now there's just no room for
error.''

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. will pay
Missouri $1 million to settle charges arising from the Wall Street
firm's guilty plea to securities fraud charges, the state said
Wednesday.
   In a separate action, state Attorney General William Webster
asked the state's supreme court to revoke the company's charter in
Missouri and order it to pay an additional $2 million fine.
   Secretary of State Roy Blunt said at a news conference that the
felonies to which Drexel pleaded guilty were ``as un-American as
rigging the World Series.''
   Missouri was the 40th jurisdiction with which Drexel has
settled. The New York-based firm said it has paid a total of $7.3
million so far in settlements.
   Drexel pleaded guilty last September to six felonies and paid
$650 million to settle a range of fraud allegations stemming from
the government's lengthy investigation of insider trading on Wall
Street.
   Drexel also agreed to dozens of administrative changes and
unprecedented federal supervision in the April settlement of civil
charges by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Under the latest agreement, Drexel cannot solicit new business
in Missouri for three years without the secretary of state's
consent; must hire an agent to find investors hurt by the company's
actions; and must pay $100,000 above the $1 million to a national
investor education fund.
   The company can continue to deal with its existing customers in
Missouri.
   Of Drexel's payments to the state, $500,000 pay for toward
investor education materials and an equal amount for grants for
business programs at Missouri colleges and universities.
   Blunt said persons found to have been financially hurt by
Drexel's action are entitled to money from a $350 million fund
under a settlement between the firm and the government. Investors
who file a claim must prove damage.
   Settling with the states relieves the firm of possible
litigation, and frees state regulators from having to investigate
the firm's trading activities from 1984 to 1986, when the SEC
alleged the fraud occurred.
   It also generally preserves the firm's ability to underwrite
securities and do other business in the states. Most states can
revoke a company's right to do business, if the firm is convicted
or admits to committing a felony. Drexel abandoned the retail
brokerage business last year.

   The stock market surged Wednesday, reversing a
five-session slide and ending the month on a bright note as
interest rate concerns subsided.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished the day at
2,590.54, up 47.30 points. The Dow Jones industrials fell 162.66
points, or 5.9 percent, during January, despite starting the year
with a gain of 56.95 points that pushed the index to an all-time
high of 2,810.15 on Jan. 2.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by a margin of about 5 to 2
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 1,116 issues up, 449 down and 411 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 189.66 million
shares, up from 186.03 million in the previous session.
   Stocks rallied at the opening on what some Wall Street analysts
called a technical bounce amid oversold conditions, then moved
steadily higher throughout the session. It was the first gain in
five sessions for the Dow Jones industrials, which had fallen more
than 72 points since last Wednesday.
   ``I don't think this is the start of an uptrend. This is
properly termed a technical bounce,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior
vice president at First Albany Corp.
   Wall Street analysts said the catalyst for the rally was the
bond market's strength despite an unexpected 0.8 percent rise in
the December index of leading indicators. Consensus expectations
were for a rise of about 0.5 percent.
   The index, composed of 11 statistics designed to forecast
economic activity six to nine months into the future, was the
latest indication that the economy, while weak, can avoid an actual
decline in growth _ or recession.
   Ordinarily the report would have been taken by the bond market
as a signal that the Federal Reserve would continue to push
interest rates higher, which would lower bond prices _ a negative
for the credit market, traders said.
   ``The bond market ignored the strong data suggesting to some
that interest rates might have peaked,'' Johnson said.
   Theodore Tung, senior vice president with National City Corp. in
Cleveland, said interest-rate worries, which have plagued the
market in recent days, have now been discounted in the market.
   ``As interest rate concerns subside, stocks are doing better,''
Tung said. ``It's all keyed to interest rates.''
   Analysts said reports that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
denied he might resign as head of the communist party eased market
jitters early in the day. The television report Tuesday jolted the
financial markets and sent the dollar soaring.
   Despite the rally, several analysts said a combination of
worries could still send the market lower in coming days _
including whether U.S. interest rates are attractive enough to lure
foreign investors to buy U.S. securities.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 221.76 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $50.308 billion, or 1.62
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
3.07 to 181.50.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, AT&amp;T advanced 1&lsqb; to
38~, Philip Morris gained ~ to 37~ on better-than-expected earnings
and IBM added 1&rsqb; to 98|.
   Chase Manhattan gained &rsqb; to 30}, Bank of New England rose \ to
4~, and Federal National Mortgage went up 2 to 31\, among
interest-rate sensitive stocks.
   Dow Chemical, whose fourth-quarter earnings fell short of
expectations, dropped 1} to 63~, Exxon was unchanged at 47 and
Occidental Petroleum, the most active stock, ended unchanged at 26|.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 6.77 to 378.69, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index added 6.10 to 329.08.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
5.09 to 415.81. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 350.07, up 4.57.

   Thousands of finger-twitching Nintendo enthusiasts
will test their skills in ``the Super Bowl of video games,'' a
nationwide playoff that promoters announced here Wednesday.
   The Nintendo World Championship, beginning here in March, is
expected to draw more than 40,000 video game enthusiasts.
   The competition eventually could involve as many as 1.2 million
contestants as the playoff moves to 29 other cities in the United
States and Canada. Winners from each city will compete for the
championship in Orlando, Fla., in late October.
   While providing a forum for true enthusiasts to show their
stuff, Nintendo also hopes to draw non-competitors and will have
games on hand for them to try. The company also will give
competitors sneak previews of new software.
   The Japanese game company is sponsoring the contest, but local
promoters are arranging competitions in each city, Dallas promoter
Danny Eaton said.
   ``Since we are the first, all the other promoters have been
calling me,'' Eaton said.
   Promoters in other cities also are expecting to draw 30,000 to
40,000 people to what Eaton called ``the Super Bowl of video
games.''
   The Dallas playoff will be held March 8-11 at an exhibition hall
nearly the size of two football fields at the city's fairgrounds.
The competition features more than 100 game stations.
   One portion of the hall, called the ``power walk,'' will preview
the new software, with game counselors on call to handle questions
from stumped players. Games will be played at two-minute intervals.
   Players will move to the second or ``super stage'' where they
can get tips on the games and question counselors. Costumed
Nintendo-character musicians will sing lyrics based on the games,
while counselors read correspondence from stumped players in a
``mail room.''
   The third section is the two-level competition stage. A video
game triathlon, the competition will combine elements of Super
Mario, Rad Racer and Tetris games.
   The top seven players from the Dallas playoff and contests in
other cities will be invited to Orlando for the national finals,
Eaton said.
   They will compete for prizes that will include a 5-figure
savings bond, a car and Nintendo software for life, said Laurie
Muslow, a company spokeswoman.
   A ticket to the championships costs $9.50 for children and
$12.50 for adults. Competitors have to pay an extra $3, Eaton said.
   The Nintendo World Championship was created by EMCI@Rockbill, a
New York-based worldwide entertainment marketing company.

<HEAD>Loss Blamed on Downturn in Appliances, Bedding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc., which is seeking
approval for its bankruptcy reorganization plan, posted a $3.1
million loss in the fourth quarter of 1989 on a 5.8 percent drop in
sales.
   The maker of Sunbeam and Oster appliances said lower operating
profits in small appliances and bedding products reflected
heightened competition.
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company's fiscal first
quarter, Allegheny lost $3.1 million, or 98 cents a share, on sales
of $213.8 million. That compared with earnings of $1.8 million, or
53 cents a share, on sales of $227 million in the same quarter a
year earlier, the company said Wednesday.
   Operating profit on consumer products, which doesn't take
account of interest payments or taxes, fell to $10.6 million in the
quarter from $21.4 million a year earlier.
   Sales and operating profits of Allegheny International's small
appliance companies in Mexico, Venezuela and Peru also declined,
mostly because of unsettled economic conditions in those countries
and a decline in the value of their currencies, the company said.
   Allegheny said earlier this week it expects to submit its
reorganization plan to a vote of creditors and shareholders within
the next week.
   The company said it believes its plan then can be confirmed by
U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Allegheny has said it could emerge from
Chapter 11 protection by June 30.

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. Wednesday said
higher costs and reduced demand contributed to a 25 percent
decrease in earnings and a 22 percent drop in sales in the final
quarter of 1989.
   Fourth quarter earnings totaled $50 million, or 58 cents a
share, on sales of $1.14 billion. That compared with earnings of
$65.7 million, or 79 cents a share, on sales of $1.33 billion in
the same period of 1988.
   Profits for all of 1989 dropped 39 percent to $245.7 million, or
$2.93 a share, from $403 million, or $5.32 a share, in 1988. Sales
slipped 4 percent to $5.25 billion from $5.48 billion.
   Special charges, primarily to cover the downsizing of the
company's Baltimore Marine and BethForge divisions, reduced
earnings for 1989 by $105 million, Bethlehem Steel said.
   Restructuring charges reduced net income by $55 million in the
fourth quarter of 1988 and by $113 million for all of 1988.
   Steel shipments fell to 2.11 million tons in the fourth quarter
from 2.39 million tons a year earlier. For the year, steel
shipments fell to 9.52 million tons from 10.07 million tons.

<TEXT>
   Albert Hakim, the businessman who controlled
the proceeds from the Reagan administration's arms sales to Iran,
has agreed to return an unspecified amount of money to the U.S.
government, Iran-Contra prosecutors said Wednesday.
   Hakim, who pleaded guilty Nov. 21 to supplementing Oliver
North's income, faces sentencing Thursday before U.S. District
Court Judge Gerhard Gesell.
   The Justice Department approved an agreement this week ''for the
return to the United States of certain funds'' by Hakim, the office
of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said in court papers.
   The Swiss government has frozen some $7.8 million held in
accounts of the ``Enterprise,'' the network of companies Hakim and
business partner Richard Secord set up to handle money in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   The court papers did not specify how much money would be
returned.
   On Monday, Iran-Contra prosecutors said in a sentencing memo
that Hakim has agreed to provide them with testimony in ``an
anticipated future case'' that pertains to a grand jury
investigation being conducted outside Washington. The prosecutors
did not elaborate, but called his cooperation ``of significant
value.''
   The question of who owns the proceeds from the Iran-Contra
affair has lingered since the scandal erupted in November 1986.
   In the secret Iran initiative, the U.S. government was paid the
cost of the weapons it sold to the Iranians. But the ``Enterprise''
charged Iran exorbitant prices for the arms, with the difference
being kept in the accounts controlled by Hakim.
   Several million dollars were diverted to the Contras fighting
the leftist government of Nicaragua. Other money was set aside for
profits for Hakim, Secord and arms dealer Thomas Clines,
congressional investigators found. Some of the money also was
supposed to be funneled to other covert U.S. programs, North has
testified.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors said that one of Hakim's companies, Lake
Resources, ``unlawfully converted for its own use profits of
approximately $11.4 million.'' A lawyer for the firm, John Hume,
denied that. Lake Resources pleaded guilty to a charge of theft of
government property in the diversion of Iran arms sales profits to
the Contras and also faces sentencing before Gesell.
   Walsh's office has ``grossly miscalculated'' by ``vastly
understating Lake Resources' costs and expenses,'' said Hume.
   As of Dec. 31, 1986, the company had $430.60 in a bank account
that has been frozen by the Swiss government.
   ``Since that time, we believe, bank fees and charges have
significantly reduced that amount,'' said Hume.
   Hume urged Gesell to levy no fine when he sentences the company,
   Theft of government property carries a $500,000 maximum fine for
a corporation.
   The prosecution asserted that a fine can be enforced ``against
those entities that have received the assets of Lake Resources
through fraudulent transactions.''
   ``The fact that, after such fraudulent transactions, Lake
Resources itself has only limited resources does not prevent
imposition of an appropriate sentence,'' associate independent
counsel Stuart Abrams said in court papers.
   Hakim, who admitted that he helped Secord pay for a $13,800
security system at North's home, could face up to one year in
prison and a $100,000 fine.

   AT&amp;T Credit Corp. said Wednesday it
purchased two financing divisions of PacifiCorp Credit Inc., a
subsidiary of PacifiCorp Financial Services for $460 million.
   The distribution financing division helps support equipment

   The asset leasing and financing division, with field offices in
Atlanta and Denver, helps provide financing for franchises, such as
restaurant chains, and media customers, Nelson said.
   The two divisions, based in Portland, Ore., were purchased for
cash obtained mostly through the sale of debt by AT&amp;T Credit Corp.
and preferred stock issued by AT&amp;T Commercial Finance Corp. to
PacifiCorp Credit.
   AT&amp;T Credit Corp. is a wholly owned subsidiary of American

<HEAD>Ex-Lucky Stores Official Settles Insider Trading Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former official of Lucky Stores Inc. has
settled civil insider trading charges that he tipped his father to
the planned acquisition of the company, federal regulators
announced Wednesday.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said David Hellberg
agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying wrongdoing in
documents filed Tuesday at federal court in Salt Lake City.
   Hellberg, a former manager of special projects for a subsidiary
of Dublin, Calif.-based Lucky Stores, was fined $328,844, but U.S.
District Judge Aldon Anderson waived all but $5,000 of the fine
because Hellberg was unable to pay more.
   The penalty ``will take roughly half his net assets, short of
selling his house,'' said James A. Kidney, an SEC attorney in
Washington.
   The SEC complaint charged that Hellberg tipped his father,
Gerald Hellberg, in 1988 to a planned acquisition of Lucky by
Irvine, Calif.-based American Stores Co.
   The father allegedly bought $15,000 in call options for Lucky
common stock. When American announced a $45-a-share tender offer,
the father allegedly made more than $328,000 in illegal profits.
   Kidney said the father has not settled with the SEC and that the
son has not made any agreement with the government to testify at
his father's upcoming trial.
   The younger Hellberg's lawyer, Doug Griffith, was in a
conference late Wednesday and was not immediately available for
comment.

   Northrop Corp. said it has agreed to sell the
twin high-rises that house its Century City headquarters to reduce
its $1.2 billion debt.
   The builder of the B-2 stealth bomber also said it would sell a
53-acre site in Anaheim where 1,300 employees produce missile test
equipment and advanced sensors for aircraft, helicopters and
missiles.
   Northrop said the properties are being sold for a total of more
than $250 million. It did not break down figures, but real estate
experts previously said the 15- and 19-story Century City
buildings, with about 540,000 square feet of space, would bring
about $220 million.
   Northrop will lease back its 131,000-square-foot corporate
offices in one of the Century City buildings.
   The employees in Anaheim are being transferred to facilities in
Hawthorne and El Segundo and will not be laid off, although their
division is undergoing a previously announced reduction of 500
workers through attrition, company spokeswoman Maria Oharenko said.
   Northrop said the sale of the office buildings is expected to be
completed next month and the Anaheim sale completed in 1991.
   The California State Teachers Retirement System is buying the
twin towers; the Anaheim property is being purchased by Taiyo
Development USA, Torrance, an American subsidiary of a Japanese
company.
   Northrop's new chief executive, Kent Kresa, said earlier this
month the company hopes to sharply reduce its debt in the 1990s and
eliminate short-term bank debt by the middle of the decade.

   Orion Pictures Corp. was wrongly identified
as a creditor of film maker Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope
Productions in a bankruptcy filing made last week, Zoetrope said
Wednesday.
   The filing for protection under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy
law said Zoetrope owed Orion $6.2 million.
   Orion issued a statement Wednesday saying it was not owed the
money. Asked about that, San Francisco-based Zoetrope referred
calls to an outside publicist, Ginger Slaughter, who gave the
following statement:
   ``Zoetrope Productions believes that the debt listed in its
Chapter 11 filing as due Orion is not in fact due Orion.''
   Ms. Slaughter said she did not know who the real creditor is.
   The biggest creditors, accounting for more than half the total
Zoetrope debt, are production companies Coppola set up to film the
movies ``The Outsiders'' and ``Rumble Fish'' in the early 1980s.
They are owed $16.2 million, according to the filing.

   Federal regulators on Wednesday seized
Phoenix-based MeraBank, Arizona's largest savings institution and
the latest victim of the state's real estate slump.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. took over MeraBank after the Office
of Thrift Supervision declared that the thrift was operating in an
unsafe and unsound condition.
   The action comes despite a Dec. 7 pledge by the thrift's parent
company, Pinnacle West Capital Corp., to inject $450 million by
March 31 into its troubled subsidiary in exchange for a release
from further obligation.
   The thrift office said it still expected Pinnacle West, which
owns Arizona's largest utility, Arizona Public Service Co., to
comply with the agreement. However, it said the infusion would
still leave MeraBank far short of its capital requirement and said
the thrift continued to weaken.
   Henry B. Sargent Jr., Pinnacle West's chief financial officer,
said the holding company would honor the agreement.
   ``This receivership doesn't affect our agreement with the OTS at
all. We didn't know when this was going to happen, but it was not
an unexpected event,'' Sargent added.
   Wednesday also was the deadline for Pinnacle West to domplete a
$624 debt million restructuring required by regulators to make sure
the holding company would be able to handle another $450 million in
debt.
   All 45 lenders involved had to sign the restructuring document,
and Sargent said late in the evening that only one signature had
not been obtained. He said the company was not working for other
``standstill agreements'' after five extensions of the original
Jan. 7 deadline.
   At the end of November, MeraBank was $337 million in the red.
With $6.6 billion in assets, it is Arizona's largest S&amp;L. It was
ranked 29th nationwide at mid-year by Sheshunoff Information
Services Inc., an Austin, Texas, consulting firm.
   Regulators said all MeraBank branches will remain open for
business as usual, operating under a new government-owned thrift
called MeraBank Federal Savings Bank. Deposits will be insured up
to $100,000 per account.
   MeraBank is the sixth Arizona savings and loan to be seized by
the government, leaving only four operating privately. The state's
second-largest, Western Savings and Loan Association of Phoenix,
was seized in June and put up for sale earlier this month.
   Arizona has been hard hit by a real estate slump. Home prices in
Phoenix, for instance, fell 6.1 percent between the third quarter
of 1989 and the same period a year earlier, according to the
National Association of Realtors.
   MeraBank operates a subsidiary in El Paso, Texas, MeraBank
Texas, which was a buyer in the 1988 government-assisted bailout of
three Texas S&amp;Ls. It got about $670 million from the government to
acquire State Federal, Lubbock; First Financial, El Paso, and
Brownfield Federal, Brownfield.
   The Texas thrifts, along with MeraBank's other holdings in the
state, now fall back into the government's possession.
   MeraBank is the 32nd S&amp;L failure so far this year. An additional
225 to 295 are likely to fail, compared with a record 328 last year
and 223 in 1988.
   Merabank was purchased for $426 million by Pinnacle West in
December 1986, the same year the state's real estate market hit the
skids. The S&amp;L has been suffering for some time, losing $209
million in 1988 and more than $190 million through the first three
quarters of 1989.
   The thrift had about $4.5 billion in deposits in 833,000
accounts.
