<HEAD>Wall's Most Famous Section Falls to Wrecking Crew</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big arm of the crane smashed into the
stacked slabs of concrete like a fist through a window, scattering
enough bits of Berlin Wall to fill a dozen souvenir stands.
   A small crowd lingered close to midnight Sunday to watch the
floodlit scene, wincing as a screeching, scraping array of machines
began clearing away the most famous section of the battered barrier.
   From this spot _ the gigantic Brandenburg Gate serving as a
breathtaking backdrop _ came the most vivid image of the collapse
of Communist East Germany.
   Thousands climbed the section of wall when the country's borders
were opened on Nov. 9, chipping away at the stretch of stone that
that was once an art gallery of political graffiti.
   ``I remember walking with my old mother here on Nov. 5 and
telling her that it won't be long before this wall is gone,'' said
West Berliner Hans Ulrich, 42, as he leaned on a guardrail and
watched the destruction.
   ``Of course, I'd been saying that for years.''
   When they built the wall around West Berlin nearly three decades
ago, Communist authorities put the most effort into the 575-foot
section that loops around the Brandenburg Gate. It was by far the
most heavily reinforced, a semi-circle of concrete slabs cemented
together and woven with heavy cable.
   With the 18th-century Brandenburg Gate the symbol of old Berlin,
this section of wall was the symbol of its division, splitting the
wide avenue that was once a main thoroughfare.
   After the wall was opened, a border crossing was cut into it at
Brandenburg Gate and the area became a major tourist attraction.
   Makeshift souvenir stands hawk everything from Berlin Wall
keychains to membership pins worn by East Germany's notorious
former secret police.
   Much of the imaginative graffiti has been chiseled away by
souvenir hunters who place great value on paint-splashed pieces of
wall. New, post-revolution graffiti has taken its place.
   ``The wall is on its way to your hometown,'' read one comment.
   The new East German government has said it will remove all of
the 100-mile barrier that encircles West Berlin. A few weeks ago,
long sections adjacent the Brandenburg Gate were demolished.
   Late Saturday night, after most of the tourists had gone home, a
West German construction crew and East German soldiers began taking
down the section of wall directly in front of the gate.
   They planned to work only at night, completing the removal
within a week. Officials say they hope to restore auto traffic down
the divided street.
   About 400 people watched Sunday night as a giant jackhammer
hooked to the end of a crane continued the slow battle against the
wall's most formidable stretch.
   ``It is a symbol, but it kept people apart,'' said East Berliner
Fabian Evers, 18, as he sold chunks of wall on a blanket near the
gate. ``It is an ideological statement to tear it down.''
   Ulricht, a school teacher, said he has no desire to see this
part of the wall remain as a memorial.
   ``This section was a symbol not only of the division of Berlin
and Germany, but of East and West Europe,'' he said. ``I enjoy very
much that this wall is coming down.''

<HEAD>Critics Charge Mayor Daley Bringing Back Machine Politics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before Richard M. Daley was elected mayor last
year, his opponent predicted he would bring the machine politics of
his famous father back to the city.
   Daley denied it then and he denies it now, saying his
administration has been ``fair to everybody.'' His critics don't
think so, especially when it comes to race and hiring for city
jobs, and they're determined to beat him next year.
   Daley, elected only a year ago to fill the last two years of
Harold Washington's second term after he died, faces re-election in
April 1991. His overall popularity is high, but some of his
detractors say his black opponent in the general election, Tim
Evans, was prescient.
   City figures show more blacks than whites have been hired by the
government during Daley's tenure. But there are more than 100 more
whites and nearly 80 fewer blacks than before in top positions,
city officials said.
   ``Daley is still playing the game of firing blacks and hiring
whites and putting his machine in place,'' said Robert Starks, a
Northeastern Illinois University professor.
   Starks also is chairman of the Task Force for Black Political
Empowerment, which worked to elect Washington as the city's first
black mayor in 1983.
   The blacks that Daley is hiring generally are loyal to the
mayor, not black neighborhoods, Starks said.
   ``It's an old technique that his father perfected,'' he said,
referring to the late Richard J. Daley, who ran the city for 21
years until his death in 1976.
   Court rulings have severely limited the kind of patronage the
elder Daley practiced, and his son says there is no machine.
   ``The writers keep writing about it,'' Daley said in a recent
interview. ``I don't see why.''
   And when asked about the lower numbers of blacks in top
positions, Daley said: ``We have black, we have Asian, we have
Hispanic, we have women in positions. ... Sure, (we're) fair to
everybody.''
   In the primary, Daley defeated Eugene Sawyer, a black former
alderman elevated to mayor temporarily by a sharply divided City
Council following Washington's heart-attack death in November 1987.
In the general election, Daley defeated third-party candidate
Evans, a city alderman.
   In Sawyer's last days as mayor, blacks and whites each held
about 42 percent of roughly 800 policy-making jobs not covered by
anti-patronage court decrees, according to Daley administration
figures.
   After less than five months of Daley's tenure, the numbers
shifted so that 57 percent of the top jobs were held by whites and
31 percent were held by blacks, officials said in the fall. Now, of
839 top positions, 54 percent are held by whites and 31 percent are
held by blacks, city Personnel Director Glenn Carr said.
   Overall, he said, the Daley administration has hired 2,168
people, including 37 percent white, 40 percent black, 13 percent
Hispanic, 2 percent Asian. The rest did not indicate their race on
employment forms. That compares with a city population that is 37
percent white, 41 percent black, 17 percent Hispanic and 4 percent
Asian.
   Evans, who has not indicated whether he will challenge Daley
again, said he thinks the mayor is vulnerable.
   ``I don't think that fairness has been a cornerstone of this
administration,'' Evans said. ``The facts show that a
disproportionately large number of people terminated have been of
African-American descent.''

<HEAD>Justice Department Says Letter Proves Waldheim Was Nazi as a
Student</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A letter recommending Kurt Waldheim for a
college scholarship shows he was a Nazi supporter while a student
in Vienna, the U.S. Justice Department and World Jewish Congress
said Saturday.
   A spokesman for the Austrian president and former United Nations
secretary-general denied the allegation.
   The May 18, 1938, letter describes Waldheim as having been ``a
convinced Nazi for years,'' the congress said in a statement. The
letter to the Austrian Chamber of Commerce was written on
Waldheim's behalf by the head of Vienna's Consular Academy, a
diplomatic college where he was studying.
   The academy director also wrote that Waldheim had submitted
proof that he had four Aryan grandparents. Waldheim got the
scholarship of 130 Reichsmarks to continue his studies for the
year, the World Jewish Congress said.
   An American graduate student in Vienna, Richard Mitten, found
the document in archives at the Consular Academy and provided it to
the World Jewish Congress, which gave it to the Justice Department.
   ``It shows the big lie as to Waldheim's claim that he was not a
Nazi supporter'' while a student in Vienna, Neal Sher, chief war
crimes prosecutor at the Justice Department, told The New York
Times.
   Austrian embassy spokesman Ulf Pacher said schoolmates
contradicted the letter, saying Waldheim was stridently anti-Nazi
while at the academy. Other than the letter ``there is no evidence
to support the theory that Waldheim was a Nazi'' at the academy,
Pacher said told the Times.
   The embassy provided two affidavits from schoolmates, the Times
reported. George Weidenfeld, who published Waldheim's memoirs in
Britain, said Waldheim ``voiced definitely anti-racist views and
had many Jewish friends at the academy.'' Susanne Lederer, a Dutch
woman who attended the academy, also said Waldheim clearly opposed
the Nazis though he ``kept silent in public.''
   Waldheim has been trying to persuade the Justice Department to
remove his name from a list of people who are banned from entering
the United States because of their activities in World War II.
   In 1986, the Justice Department found evidence that Waldheim had
persecuted Jews, Greeks and Yugoslavs after he joined the German
army.
   ``Waldheim, who has been shown to lie about his years during the
war and after the war, has now been shown to lie about his years
before the war,'' Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World
Jewish Congress, said Saturday night.

<DATELINE>KALAPANA, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mark Nicoll sat in his home watching a
movie on television. The screen showed a community being overrun by
fire.
   For Nicoll, it was just another example of art imitating life.
Outside, a fiery mass of lava crept inexorably toward his uninsured
home. It will be the second time he has lost a home to Kilauea
Volcano and the insatiable volcano goddess Pele.
   Life in the rural coastal Kalapana Gardens subdivision is
surreal, as residents scramble to save their homes while tourists
flock to photograph the majestic coastline and the impending doom.
   Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim predicts
that in less than a week the remaining homes, two historic churches
and the lone general store will be swallowed up by the oozing lava
that now measures 8 miles long and 600 yards wide and travels up to
a foot a minute at times.
   Since it started erupting on Jan. 3, 1983, Kilauea has consumed
114 homes _ three of them on Saturday _ in the four subdivisions
that made up the community of Kalapana. No one has been killed, but
property damage over the seven years has been estimated at $25
million.
   Kalapana Gardens is the only subdivision left and the clock is
running out. Fewer than 50 homes remain, but a precise number is
difficult to determine as residents hasten to take apart the houses
to move them elsewhere.
   Gov. John Waihee declared Kalapana a disaster area Saturday, a
move that opens the way for low-interest loans and other assistance.
   Officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency were
expected to tour the area Monday and make an assessment.
   Nicoll and his wife, Belinda, built their current home in 1986
after losing a home to Kilauea the year before. They said they
loved the area too much to leave despite the risk.
   The Nicolls don't have insurance because companies stopped
offering coverage after a 1986 flow ravaged the area. Now the
couple must choose between letting their home burn or taking it
apart board by board.
   They are paralyzed because they have no money to buy other
property to put their home on. Still, they must move.
   ``I never thought it was going to get this close,'' said Nicoll.
``We're so stressed out from this.''
   ``We've been putting it off as long as we can,'' said Mrs.
Nicoll. ``When you have no place to go ...''
   Michael Stephens' home went Thursday, giving him the dubious
honor of being the 100th homeowner to lose a house. He had
insurance because he moved to the subdivision in 1983, when
policies were easily obtained. He said he will move to California
with the money from his $60,000 settlement.
   Stephens was angry, however, over what he called the state's
lack of aid to the area. ``The state is at fault for not appointing
insurance companies to the areas affected by red-lining,'' he said.
``People don't care. They think we're stupid for being here.''
   Walter Yamaguchi is the 82-year-old owner of the Kalapana Store
&amp; Drive-In, which he has operated since 1974. He has lived in the
area since the 1920s and says he is not leaving.
   ``Pele is going to stop,'' he said of the Hawaiian goddess.
``She will never take me away from here.''
   ``A lot of people are scared, but I tell them `Take it easy,' he
said. ``I tell them, `What's the difference? Let Pele have it if
she wants.'''
   The lava was 425 yards from the little store Saturday.
   Workers began removing the stained glass windows Friday from
Star-of-the-Sea Catholic Church, which the locals call the Painted
Church because of its brightly decorated interior. Services were
still scheduled for Sunday at the nearly 100-year-old church, said
Kini Pea, the custodian.
   Moving companies have offered to move the church and neighboring
Kalapana Mauna Kea Congregational Church free of charge.
   ``We'll try to remove as much of the inside as possible,'' the
custodian said.
   Moving companies are offering free or reduced rate service to
residents, helping to pack their belongings or move their homes.
   Kim said in an interview Thursday night as he monitored the lava
flow that the last month has been one of the most frustrating in
his 12 years as head of the agency.
   ``My frustrations build on a personal feeling that we are losing
a part of Hawaii. This is our land and our home,'' said Kim, who
lives in Hilo, the county seat, about 30 miles north of the
subdivision.
   At the Red Cross emergency center, adjacent to the civil defense
command post, volunteers pass out food to the nearly 100 people who
have lost their homes and are living in tents in Harry K. Brown
Park.
   ``They're disoriented now,'' said Gary Poretsky, who used to
live in the area and has returned to help friends. ``You hate to
see people lose their homes, but people are adaptable and they can
relocate.''
   Red Cross volunteer James Schilling says fights have broken out
sporadically at the park because some people can't accept the fact
they are unable to halt the destruction.
   ``It's getting intense,'' he said. ``People are starting to
realize it's no joke. ''

   Thousands of workers Sunday hurled
rocks at police and shouted anti-government slogans to protest a
raid that crushed a three-day strike at the world's largest
shipyard.
   About 2,500 workers fought running street battles in the dense
fog of tear gas near the Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. shipyard
outside the industrial city of Ulsan, about 200 miles southest of
Seoul.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties in Sunday's
renewed fighting. At least 24 people, including 10 policemen, were
injured when police stormed the shipyard and then clashed with
workers in the streets of this city during much of Saturday.
   The strike began Wednesday over of the arrests of four union
leaders who participated in earlier protests and obstructing work
at the company. Wage negotiations were scheduled to begin last
Friday, but workers said wages were not a main issue in the strike.
   On Sunday, groups of up to 200 workers threw rocks and other
objects at police after massing in back alleys in a residential
area facing the shipyard. Some workers used slingshots to shoot
rocks at the police, who retaliated with tear gas.
   ``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo!'' workers shouted as they
raised clenched fists into the air.
   At one point, about 300 riot police were driven by workers into
a small factory, where they were isolated for more than one hour.
Workers blocked their exit by piling broken furniture at the
plant's gate and setting it on fire. The police were rescued later
by colleagues.
   Some residents, apparently relatives of shipyard workers, jeered
at police.
   About 13,000 riot police reinforced their battle lines as
workers vowed to continue demonstrations to protest Saturday's
police attack on the shipyard.
   Police said they were investigating charges against some of the
607 workers detained in Saturday's clashes.
   On Saturday evening, labor unions of the shipyard's nine Hyundai
subsidiaries in the city said they would stage sympathy strikes.
   On Sunday, police set up checkpoints and roadblocks and searched
all vehicles traveling toward the shipyard, located 2{ miles from
this city. More police were seen patrolling around the city.
   At the shipyard, about 150 workers continued to hold out on top
of a giant 240-foot crane Sunday, occasionally shouting slogans,
which were inaudible in winds. They hung down a huge slogan
reading, ``Let's win collective bargaining and achieve our dream of
owning houses.''
   Police spread nets and air mattresses around the base of the
crane for fear that angry workers may commit suicide in despair.
Reports said the group had enough food and homemade arms to hold
out for at least 15 days.
   Squads of riot police guarded each of the five main gates to the
shipyard and checked all visitors. Several Hyundai office workers
were busy removing remains of burned workers tents, arms and rocks
littered around.
   At dawn Saturday, about 13,000 riot police stormed the closed
shipyard to rout about 2,000 workers. About 24,000 people work at
the complex.
   Authorities fired hundreds of tear-gas shells from at least 10
armored vans as bulldozers tore down 9-foot-high barricades erected
by the workers. The riot police rushed in, wearing gas masks and
helmets and carrying clubs and shields.
   Hundreds of workers retaliated by throwing firebombs, steel
bars, rocks and pieces of metal. Strikers fired several rounds from
at least one of about a dozen homemade cannons, but it was not
known if anyone was injured by the blasts.
   The fighting spread to the streets, where some estimates said up
to 20,000 workers battled police. Television footage showed police
kicking and beating some workers with clubs as they led them away
to police vans.
   Twenty-two police vehicles were damaged or destroyed, including
two buses and five fire engines, police and reports said.
   Authorities closed major roads in the area, suspended flights
and canceled classes at 26 schools.
   Leaders of the shipyard union said they would hold talks Sunday
to discuss strategy with workers from other Hyundai companies. They
said 15 of 32 Hyundai company unions pledged to support the strike.
   The Hyundai Group, owner of the shipyard and one of South
Korea's largest conglomerates, is the major employer in this city
of 648,000 with well over 100,000 employees. Hyundai makes ships,
cars, electronics, steel and other products.
   Hyundai had requested government action to end the strike after
negotiations broke down hours before.
   Last year, about 12,000 police stormed the Hyundai shipyard to
end a bitter 109-day strike.
   ``It is extremely regrettable the government carried out a
military-style operation to suppress the worker's strike,'' said
Kim Tae-shik, spokesman for the opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy. He urged the government to release the union leaders.
   Hundreds of radical students protested Saturday at campuses in
Inchon and Kwangju denouncing the police action against strikers,
the South Korean news agency Yonhap said.
   In Seoul, Ahn Dong-su, union leader at the state Korean
Broadcasting System said broadcast operations would return to
normal Monday, ending a 17-day-old protest prompted over a new
government-appointed president.
   Ahn said he had received assurances the network president, a
former government spokesman, would resign ``at an early date.''
   It was unclear whether the decision would be accepted by the
5,000-member union, which had said its new boss was restricting
press freedoms.

   A Metropolitan Opera singer was hit on the head
by a collapsing piece of scenery during a performance Saturday
night and was taken to a hospital.
   Soprano Hildegard Behrens was injured during the final scene of
Richard Wagner's ``Goetterdaemmerung.'' She had a grazed forehead
and scrapes on her elbows, said Metropolitan Opera spokesman Peter
Clark.
   In the final five minutes of the six-hour opera, Miss Behrens,
playing Bruennhilda, slipped going up some stage steps and was
thrown to the ground when an overhead beam collapsed too early. The
beam was made of foam rubber covered with canvas, Clark said.
   Miss Behrens walked off the stage under her own power and was
taken to Roosevelt Hospital. Brian Dawson, clerk at the hospital
emergency room, said Miss Behrens was being treated and would be
released.
   The opera staff announced to the audience of 4,000 that Miss
Behrens was being helped, and there were no curtain calls.

   Anti-nuclear protesters climbed fences around
the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant on Saturday, and 31 were
arrested and charged with criminal trespassing, police said.
   Eight of the protesters were arrested for climbing a 300-foot
exhaust stack on the plant site. Two more demonstrators still on
the stack late Saturday night would be arrested when they came
down, plant spokeswoman Mary Schneider said.
   The protesters used a ladder to climb the plant's fence at about
5 p.m. during a rally attended by about 150 people, Vernon Police
Chief Herb Meyer said.
   The rally marked the anniversary of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
accident in the Soviet Union.
   Outside the plant's main gate, protestors staged a ``die in''
and used wire to keep the gates closed. The demonstrators said they
wanted to shut the plant by blockading it, but Schneider said the
reactor continued normal operation.

<TEXT>
   Discovery returned home
from its five-day telescope delivery mission today, landing at this
windswept desert Air Force Base after a fiery plunge through the
atmosphere.
   ``Welcome back, congratulations on a super mission. The world is
looking forward to reaping the benefits of your good work over the
next 15 years,'' said Mission Control's Steve Oswald.
   ``We sure enjoyed it also; it was great fun,'' said Commander
Loren J. Shriver.
   Left in space by the five Discovery astronauts was the Hubble
Space Telescope, a $1.5 billion marvel that, when it begins
operating properly, will look for evidence of the birth of the
universe and for planets orbiting a sun much like ours.
   Mission Control delayed its permission for Discovery to leave
orbit until almost the last minute, after watching a night of
shifting winds. Discovery was directed to a concrete runway,
instead of the planned hard-packed desert strip, because wind
conditions were better there.
   Shriver and pilot Charles Bolden took over the controls from the
shuttle's computers the last few minutes. Also in the crew were
mission specialists Steven Hawley, Bruce McCandless and Kathryn
Sullivan.
   The arrival was heralded by the usual two sonic booms sweeping
across the desert. The dawning sun glinted off the ship's
underside. The landing was exactly on time at 9:50 a.m. EDT.
   Twenty thousand people, many wrapped in blankets for protection
against the wind, cheered as the shuttle touched down. There were a
few scattered clouds.
   The shuttle had circled Earth 75 times since its launch Tuesday
from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, traveling more than
2,068,213 miles.
   Shriver fired Discovery's two orbital maneuvering engines for
nearly five minutes over the east coast of Africa, 380 miles high
and traveling 17,400 mph. The firing slowed the ship by nearly 400
mph and it headed toward Earth, entering the atmosphere over the
Pacific between New Guinea and Hawaii.
   The shuttle is the first to be equipped with new carbon brakes.
NASA would have preferred to land Discovery on the longer desert
runway because it would have provided more margin for a slow
rolling stop that would not tax the brakes.
   The carbon brakes can withstand longer stopping distances and
higher temperatures than the older carbon-lined beryllium brakes.
Their lifetime is expected to be 50 landings; the older brakes are
designed for only six.
   The Hubble Telescope has been troublesome from the day it was
put overboard by astronaut Steven Hawley and is still crippled with
its high-data rate antennas locked into unusable positions.
   However, engineers guiding the telescope's checkout managed
overnight to transmit recorded data about the antenna problems over
a secondary, low-gain antenna. They expect to get clues to fixing
the problem.
   The telescope is an apparatus of almost limitless vision that is
expected to provide astronomical data for 15 years, revealing
celestial secrets dating back to the time the universe was created.
   The 12{-ton telescope, with the smoothest mirror ever made, was
released from the shuttle cargo bay on Wednesday. Its lens was
uncovered in space for the first time on Friday.
   When controllers moved the telescope's high-speed antenna and,
again when the lens cover was opened, the actions moved the
telescope too much and an automatic system shut down the
electronics. It took more than a day to restore them.

   A group of Japanese businessmen has paid more than
$14 million for a 59-year-old Bugatti Royale, making the Italian
car the world's most expensive, The Sunday Times reported.
   The three-ton luxury car, one of only six of its kind, overtakes
a 1963 Ferrari GTO that fetched about $13 million from a Japanese
buyer in November, the report said.
   The Type 41 Royale cost $22,300 when it was built in 1931. Its
last owner was Hans Thulin, a Swedish real estate developer.
   The Sunday Times said the sale was confirmed by Nicholas Harley,
a London dealer in vintage cars.

   All 2,000 families left homeless by an earthquake
in central China have been moved into tents, the official Xinhua
News Agency said Sunday.
   At least 118 people were killed in the quake Thursday _ the
deadliest in China since November 1988.
   State television news on Saturday showed clusters of white tents
set up on the stark wind-swept plateau of the Hainan Tibetan
Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai province.
   Xinhua said 600 policemen and local officials had been mobilized
to deliver tents, quilts, food and clothes to the disaster area, a
region about 70 miles southwest of the provincial capital of
Xining. It is inhabited mainly by Tibetan herdsmen and peasants.
   The temblor, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, was the
worst in this quake-prone nation since November 1988, when 730
people were killed near China's southwest border with Burma.
   Xinhua, which earlier put the death toll at 126 people, said in
its latest report that 118 people died. The reason for the
discrepancy was not clear.

<HEAD>About 100 Vietnamese Boat People Escape From Detention Center</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 100 Vietnamese boat people cut through
fences and escaped Sunday from a detention camp in suburban Hong
Kong, police said.
   The escape occurred shortly after midnight, and by Sunday
evening, 16 of the Vietnamese had been captured, police said. About
100 policemen were searching for the remaining escapees.
   Police gave no reason for the breakout from the Whitehead
detention camp in Hong Kong's New Territories district.
   About 22,500 Vietnamese live in the camp, most awaiting
screening on whether they qualify as refugees for resettlement in
other countries.
   Under a policy adopted in 1988 to stem the tide of Vietnamese
who fled their Communist homeland, those who fail to qualify for
refugee status face repatriation.
   More than 1,000 Vietnamese have been voluntarily returned to
their homeland during the past year.
   A group of 51 boat people denied refugee status were sent back
to Vietnam against their will in December. No more Vietnamese have
been forcibly repatriated since then, largely because of U.S.
demands that they be given until next year to go home voluntarily.
   There are about 55,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong now awaiting
resettlement overseas or repatriation to Vietnam.

<HEAD>Pakistan Accuses India of Sabre-Rattling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pakistan on Sunday dismissed
allegations of interference in Indian-held Kashmir as false and
untenable and accused India of ``whipping up a war psychosis and
indulging in sabre-rattling.''
   But the No. 2-ranking defense official said a hot-line between
senior military commanders of India and Pakistan remains open and
the tense situation between the uneasy neighbors ``is gradually
moving toward normalcy.''
   The remarks by a foreign ministry spokesman and the deputy
defense minister Col. Ghulam Sarwar Cheema were in response to
India's latest charges Pakistan is arming and training Moslem
separatists in Indian-controlled Kashmir.
   ``No amount of sophistry can hide the fact that the insurrection
there is totally indigenous,'' the foreign ministry spokesman said.
``The root of the insurrection is the continued denial of the right
of self-determination of the people in Indian-occupied Kashmir.''
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said Pakistan was ``deeply disappointed'' by the ``false
allegations and untenable assertions'' made Saturday by the Indian
government.
   New Delhi warned Pakistan it would not tolerate infringement of
its sovereignty in Kashmir, and a government spokesman refused to
rule out cross-border raids to eliminate suspected guerrilla camps.
   ``There will be no compromise on the measures necessary to
protect our integrity,'' the Indian government said in a statement.
   The foreign ministry spokesman said Pakistan regrets India ``has
persisted in its belicose statements after the foreign minister of
India in New York three days ago agreed with his Pakistan
counterpart to exercise restraint.''
   More than 300 people have been killed in Indian-held Kashmir
since Jan. 20 when Indian troops launched their latest and harshest
crackdown on Moslem separatists. Most were Moslem militants or
supporters shot by Indian troops during anti-India demonstrations
or while defying curfews.
   India regularly accuses Pakistan of arming, training and
financing the Kashmiri militants who want to secede from mostly
Hindu India and become an independent nation with neutral status.
Islamabad routinely denies the allegations, but says it supports
the Kashmiris right to self-determination.
   ``Instead of whipping up a war psychosis and indulging in
sabre-rattling, we hope India will align its position to the
position of the international community, which stands for the
peaceful settlement of the Kashmir dispute,'' the foreign ministry
spokesman said.
   As violence by Moslem militants escalated, both countries
reinforced their troops along the border and the contested Kashmir
frontier. Each side has repeatedly said it does not want war but
has accused the other of fomenting a climate that could lead to
armed confrontation.
   New Delhi has repeatedly denied allegations of abuse and torture
by Indian troops in Kashmir.
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, which is
divided by a cease-fire line monitored by the united nations.
   Kashmir was a princely state when India and Pakistan were
partitioned along religious lines into separate nations. Most of
Kashmir's residents were Moslems, but the ruler was a Hindu who
opted for union with India.
   Pakistan moved into the northern third of Kashmir. The rest came
under Indian control as part of the state of Jammu-Kashmir, the
only Moslem state in India.
   ``Pakistan does not want another war and no saner elements _
either in India or Pakistan _ will support war,'' Cheema told
reporters in Rawalpindi.
   ``The hot-line is still open between the senior military
commanders of the two countries and Pakistan is taking all steps to
reduce tension.''

   Seventeen years ago, Congress took a small
step toward national health insurance when it decided to take on
the costs of life-saving treatment for nearly all Americans whose
kidneys had failed.
   It was supposed to cost about $200 million a year.
   Today, the cost is more than $3.3 billion.
   ``If the kidney program were to come up today, it would be
completely dead in the water ... because of the obsession to bring
costs down,'' said Arthur Caplan, head of the University of
Minnesota's Center for Biomedical Ethics.
   ``The reason we don't have national health insurance is the
kidney program,'' he said. ``The costs associated with it scared
legislators out of their gourds.''
   In the early 1970s, government money was flowing more freely and
only dollars stood in the way of life-saving treatment for the many
thousands of people whose kidneys failed.
   The success rate of kidney transplants was up, but this option
was expensive and limited by the supply of donated organs.
   The other effective option, the artificial kidney machine that
cleans the blood of toxins in a process called dialysis, was also
expensive. However, the number of patients who needed the
relatively new procedure was far greater than the supply of
machines could handle.
   Life-saving treatment was being rationed by hospital committees
that were deciding, essentially, who would live and who would die.
   The technology to save lives was there. As Sen. Vance Hartke,
D-Ind., posed the question on the Senate floor in 1972: ``How do we
explain that the difference between life and death is a matter of
dollars?''
   That year, Congress extended Medicare coverage to nearly all
patients in the advanced stages of kidney disease, regardless of
age.
   With this coverage, patients pay about 20 percent of the cost of
treatment _ whether transplant or dialysis _ and the federal
government pays 80 percent.
   The medical industry responded by building dialysis treatment
centers across the country. There are now about 1,800 centers, with
80 to 90 added each year.
   More than 80 percent of dialysis patients go to one of these
centers three times a week for treatments that last four to six
hours each, at a cost of about $25,000 to $30,000 annually. The
remainder are treated in their homes, at around $20,000 a year.
   Caplan asserts that the kidney program has been a ``bonanza for
for-profit medicine'' and says the program's price tag could be cut
considerably if the government encouraged more home treatment. In
Britain, he said, 66 percent of dialysis patients are treated in
their homes.
   But that issue aside, even in the early years of the program, it
was apparent that Congress had vastly underestimated the cost of
dialysis and transplants, which now run about $25,000 per patient
plus several thousand dollars a year for anti-rejection drugs.
   And as the costs rose steadily, the profile of kidney patients
getting the life-saving treatment changed.
   Before the program, three of four dialysis patients were men,
most were well-educated, almost 42 percent had jobs, 91 percent
were white, and only 7 percent were over 55. By 1981, more than 45
percent were over 55, half were women, 35 percent were black and
only 18 percent were working, researchers reported at the time.
   Now, the elderly are the fastest growing group on dialysis, with
about 30 percent of patients over 65.
   Physicians ``are under a great deal of pressure from family and
patients (to use dialysis) even when the prognosis is poor,'' said
Daniel Callahan, director of The Hastings Center in Briarciff
Manor, N.Y., an independent non-profit research organization that
examines ethical issues in medicine.
   The latest government figures available put the cost of the
program in 1987 at $3.3 billion and rising by about $300 million a
year. Some 147,000 patients had coverage under the program at some
time in that year.
   ``We have chosen not to make difficult choices with this
disease,'' said Paul Rettig, executive director of the American
Hospital Association. ``The money is in the Medicare program ...
and we made a financial choice to pay for it.''
   But government money does not flow so freely now, and lawmakers
are looking around every corner for places to cut the budget.
   Few suggest turning back the clock with repeal of the kidney
program, but some question use of transplants and dialysis in
``marginal'' patients, those who have other medical problems and
are not likely to live long in any event.
   The fundamental question is how scarce resources should be
spread among all who need them, said Richard A. Rettig, who is
directing an Institute of Medicine study on the kidney program.
   ``This is one of those things we recognize as a source of
anxiety. We walk up to it and walk away from it and walk around it,
because we have no way to decently confront it directly,'' he said.
   ``The renal world did confront it in the 1960s; they were
relieved from doing so in the '70s and '80s,'' he said, ``but the
question doesn't go away.''

   On a sunny morning one year ago,
parishioners of the Olive Branch United Brethren Church sat in
puzzled silence waiting for the Rev. Robert L. Pelley to walk from
the modest parsonage and step into the pulpit.
   A church member finally went to the parsonage and unlocked the
door.
   The body of the 38-year-old pastor lay sprawled in a narrow
hallway outside his bedroom. In a basement recreation room lay the
bodies of his wife, Dawn, 32, and her daughters, 8-year-old Janel
and Jolene, 6. All four had been shot to death the day before,
April 29, 1989.
   Three older children were not at home and survived.
   Police worked without success to amass enough evidence to make
an arrest.
   In autumn, Olive Branch at last got a new pastor, Don Dennie, a
Hoosier native who had lived out West most of the past two decades.
   Dennie, 58, found the congregation distraught and even fearful
of the parsonage. So Dennie and his wife, Gloria, decided to hold
an open house to dispel the fears.
   ``We made sure everybody went all the way through the house,
especially the basement,'' he said in a recent interview.
   ``They're doing well,'' Dennie said of his parishioners.
   But things have changed little in the police investigation. The
case remains open and the investigation active, says St. Joseph
County sheriff's Sgt. Charles Feirrell. Investigators report no
progress toward an arrest.
   Police unsuccessfully searched the surrounding fields, woods and
ponds for the shotgun used in the slayings. Laboratory tests on
evidence taken from the home yielded no signficant clues.
   The surviving children are Jackie, then 14, Jessica 10, and
Robert J., known to family and friends as Jeff, 18.
   The Pelleys had married after the deaths of their spouses. Jeff
and Jackie were Pelley's children from his first marriage; Jessica,
Janel and Jolene came from Mrs. Pelley's first marriage.
   Jackie was attending a church camp when the killings occurred,
and Jessica had spent the night with friends. Jeff told police he
had left home that afternoon to attend his high school prom and was
away overnight for post-prom activities, then drove with friends
Sunday to an amusement park north of Chicago.
   Jackie and Jessica now live with relatives in other states,
Jackie in Burlington, Ky., and her sister in Eaton County, Mich.
Jeff Pelley enrolled in Manchester College last fall, but dropped
out and is working for a cabinetmaker in Nappanee, Dennie said.
   He could not be reached for comment; he has an unlisted number.
   ``It's a very disconcerting thing to know it hasn't been solved
yet,'' said Dennie.
   Police questioned Jeff Pelley for several hours the evening
after the bodies were discovered and then allowed him to go.
Investigators that night hinted of a possible suspect, but quickly
backed away the next day.
   Police have never identified a suspect. They ruled out burglary
and robbery almost immediately but otherwise have refused to
discuss a motive.
   The Rev. Don Merrilatt, a colleague of Pelley's, said Pelley had
talked to him about friction among the children as the remarried
couple worked to unite two families.
   ``Every family trying to merge has these pressures,'' Merrilatt
said three days after the slayings. ``The children have allegiance
to their first father and mother. There are natural difficulties
there.''

   A butane gas cylinder exploded while
families were making tea beside the graves of dead relatives at a
cemetery in a southern province, and 12 people were killed,
newspapers reported Sunday.
   Cairo newspapers said the victims, from two families, were
burned to death in Thursday's accident at a village in el-Minya
province.
   Only one member of one of the families, an 11-year-old boy,
reportedly survived. But he was hospitalized in critical condition.
   Thursday was the first of the three-day Eid al-Fitr, which marks
the end of the holy month of Ramadan.
   Many Moslem visit graves of dead relatives on the first day of
Eid al-Fitr. While there, some cook and make tea.

   Despite improvement in global health, two of five
deaths still occur from preventable causes, according to a survey
published Sunday by the World Health Organization.
   About 200 million people may still die of preventable diseases
in the 1990s ``if the current trend continues'' but that many could
be saved if more money were spent on health care, said the U.N.
agency's director-general, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima.
   ``Many of the world's illnesses are preventable or treatable
with inexpensive vaccines, antibiotics or oral rehydration
therapy,'' he said in commenting on the 56-page survey.
   ``With the decrease in global military tension, there may be
more money to fight the worldwide war on disease,'' he added. ``We
are looking for a health dividend.''
   The survey says the 50 million people dying worldwide from all
causes each year include 14.5 million children under the age of 5
in developing countries.
   ``More than 8,000 children die each day because they are not
immunized, almost 11,000 a day die of dehydration caused by
diarrhea, and about 8,000 a day of pneumonia.
   ``The cost of immunizing all children and providing medication
for dehydration and pneumonia is estimated to be about $2.5 billion
a year,'' it said, adding such efforts could save 7.5 million
children a year.
   The report did not say how much now is spent on such
immunization and medical care.
   The report stresses a change in lifestyle would prevent one of
two early deaths due to cardiovascular diseases. It also estimates
that 3 million adults die annually from ``tobacco-related
diseases.''
   ``The prevention of these deaths is the most simple of all,''
the report said.
   Hepatitis B, a liver infection blamed in 1 million to 2 million
deaths per year, is listed as the most prevalent disease worldwide.
WHO estimates that more than 2 billion people, or about two fifths
of the world's total population, are infected with the hepatitis-B
virus, HBV.
   It adds that ``HBV infection is now preventable with a safe and
effective vaccine.''
   A combined 1.4 to 1.6 billion people are estimated to be
suffering from ascariasis and hookworm, intestinal parasitic
infections that are particularly widespread in tropical zones.
   Cardiovascular diseases, with an annual 12 million deaths, are
listed as the biggest single killer, followed by diarrheal
diseases, 5 million; cancer and pneumonia, 4.8 million each;
tuberculosis, 3 million; and chronic lung diseases, 2.7 million.
   Malaria, with an estimated annual toll of 1 to 2 million deaths
and whooping cough, which kills about 500,000, are also ranked well
ahead of AIDS, estimated to claim about 200,000 lives annually
worldwide.
   The agency, which in 1977 proclaimed a goal of ``health for all
by the year 2000,'' said the health situation remains worst in
Southest Asia, where about 40 percent of the region's total
population of 1.2 billion suffers from malnutrition and diseases
ranging from diarrhea to malaria.
   In sub-Saharan Africa, about 30 percent are ill. In South and
Central America, the share is 25 percent, the same as in North
Africa and the Middle East.
   In the past decade, health care has brought some significant
improvements, the agency said. Life expectancy in the developing
countries is now estimated to average 59.7 years, which it said
represented a sharp rise. In the developed countries, it has
reached 73.4 years.

<HEAD>Official Discloses Cases of Police Torture, Illegal Detention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities investigated nearly 500 cases of
people injured or killed because of torture, illegal detention or
other police abuses during the first three months of this year, a
state prosecutor said.
   The number far exceeds previous official figures for abuses by
police, which China acknowledges but insists are rare and are
punished when discovered.
   Liang Guoqing, deputy chief procurator of the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, told a news conference Saturday that the government
had dealt with more than 9,500 cases in the first quarter of 1990
involving dereliction of duty and infringement of citizens' rights
by police or other law enforcement officials.
   He said priority was given to cases of extorting confessions by
torture, illegal detention, neglect of duty and taking bribes to
distort justice.
   Among these were more than 490 ``major cases involving deaths
and injuries,'' the official Xinhua News Agency quoted him as
saying.
   It did not give details of any of the cases.
   By comparison, Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's
Court, said last year that there had been 4,700 cases in all of
1988 involving police torture, frame-ups, illegal detention and
other abuses, of which only 227 resulted in injury or death.
   China began acknowledging police abuses, including torture, in
the mid-1980s but has always insisted that these are isolated cases
that violate police policy.
   Many such cases occur in rural areas where police are poorly
educated, but the root cause is the broad power wielded by police
over civilians despite a legal code put in place over the past
decade.
   None of the official reports on torture and other abuses,
including Saturday's, have mentioned cases involving political
dissidents. China maintains that it has no political prisoners, and
that dissidents are jailed only for specific actions such as making
counterrevolutionary propaganda or seeking to overthrow the
Communist Party.
   Released dissidents have reported being forced to wear tight
handcuffs for days, being placed in very cramped cells and being
deprived of sleep.

<HEAD>New Prime Minister Demands Resignation of Regional Officials</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nepal's new prime minister demanded the
resignation of the country's 14 top regional administrators Sunday,
many of whom had supported a police crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, a leader of the pro-democracy
campaign, did not specify why he had asked for the resignation of
the Himalayan country's 14 zonal commissioners.
   But Bhattarai said he told the officials during a meeting in the
capital, Katmandu, that their ``office had become redundant'' in
Nepal's emerging multiparty democracy.
   Also Sunday, a government-run newspaper reported the country's
former hard-line prime minister has declared his support for the
new interim government headed by Bhattarai.
   The English-language Rising Nepal newspaper said Marich Man
Singh Shrestha delivered a statement by telephone late Saturday to
the state-run news agency, Rashtriya Samachar Samiti.
   It was the first reported statement by Shrestha since he went
into hiding after being dismissed April 6 by King Birendra for
failing to maintain law and order.
   The newspaper, which gave no details of Shrestha's wherabouts,
said he expressed confidence the interim government would ``receive
the cooperation of all.''
   Bhattarai said his government also was not aware of where
Shrestha was hiding, but said the former prime minister's support
shows that ``wisdom has dawned on him.''
   Shrestha's statement came amid growing demands from parties
within the new government coalition for his arrest and prosecution,
and similar action against other members of his administration.
   The centrist Nepali Congress Party, a coalition member, has
ruled out hasty arrests. A party spokesman has said the new
government will not be vindictive toward members of the country's
former partyless government, known as the Panchayat.
   The interim government, composed of pro-democracy leaders from
the Nepali Congress Party and the United Left Front, a coalition of
leftist parties, took office April 19. The 11-member Cabinet also
includes two independents and two Birendra nominees.
   Bhattarai, the Nepali Congress Party president, said there was
no immediate reaction from the regaional commissioners to his call
for their resignation.
   But G.P. Koirala, the Congress Party's general secretary, said,
``If they have any sense they will resign immediately.''
   Nepal's 14 zones cover the country's 75 districts, and the
commissioners, who are appointed by the king, wield almost total
control over the executive, judicial and legislative branches in
their areas.
   Many of the commissioners conveyed to police the hard-line
government's orders to shoot pro-democracy demonstrators April 6.
   According to the royal palace, the crackdown left 10 people dead
and 107 injured throughout the country on April 6. But witnesses
said at least 200 people were killed in Katmandu alone.
   The ensuing outcry forced Birendra to lift a 29-year-old ban on
political parties and dismantle the partyless system of government
which he dominated.

   The leading abortion-rights group has built up
a political warchest this year nearly seven times as large as the
funds held by the chief anti-abortion organization, but that lead
may not last long.
   The political action committee for the National Abortion Rights
Action League raised more than $300,000 in the first three months
of this year, while the National Right to Life PAC raised just over
$7,000, according to federal disclosure reports.
   NARAL's PAC ended the quarter with $347,000 in the bank,
compared with $51,000 for National Right to Life, according to
Federal Election Commission records.
   The lopsided pace of fund raising could end soon, however. An
anti-abortion rally in Washington on Saturday attracted some
200,000 people, and the National Right to Life PAC is preparing to
launch its annual direct mail campaign this spring.
   The PAC has demonstrated before it can raise substantial sums
quickly. It had $3,400 on hand at the end of June 1989 but raised
$460,000 in the second half of the year.
   Most of that money, however, was spent on special congressional
elections and gubernatorial races in which abortion-rights
candidates were overwhelmingly successful.
   Those results led to some speculation that the pro-life forces
would lie low or be shunned by candidates this year, but leaders of
the National Right To Life PAC have promised to be even more active.
   Sandra Faucher, director of the PAC, said she was confident
``we'll be able to raise as much as it takes.''
   ``We never raise funds in the first quarter,'' she said. ``We
have our own agenda and don't worry about what anyone else is
raising.''
   Indeed, just last year the National Right to Life PAC quickly
erased a similar NARAL edge.
   So far this year, NARAL has been more aggressive in raising and
spending money on congressional elections, according to quarterly
reports filed with the FEC. A second abortion-rights PAC, Voters
for Choice, raised $111,000 in the January-March period, the
records show.
   ``The response to our fund-raising appeals has been
overwhelming, and it shows what an important voting issue choice is
to people,'' NARAL spokeswoman Loretta Ucelli said.
   The reports do not include money raised by separate PACs the
national organizations maintain to contribute to state races, a
major abortion battleground in the wake of the last year's Supreme
Court decision giving states more authority to restrict abortions.
   Those state funds, however, generally get most of their money
from their federal affiliates. Also not included are generic
political expenses the groups are allowed to finance with general
treasury funds.
   NARAL's PAC reported it had raised $308,000 so far this year and
spent $142,000, of which $42,000 was contributed to federal
candidates or other PACs.
   The Right to Life PAC reported receipts of $7,200 in the
January-March period and contributions of $4,100 to congressional
candidates and $5,000 to the North Carolina Right to Life PAC.
   In addition to the National Right to Life PAC, there are dozens
of state Right to Life organizations with federal PACs that support
congressional candidates. Most of them, however, reported little or
no fund raising in the first quarter, according to FEC records.
   The only such state groups raising more than $5,000 in the
period were in California, Ohio and Illinois.
   Much of the congressional campaign activity for PACs involved in
the abortion debate depends on the outcome of upcoming primary
elections.
   Despite their different approaches to fund raising, the NARAL
and National Right to Life PACs are relatively close in total
receipts so far in the two-year election cycle, according to FEC
records. The National Right to Life PAC has raised $506,000 since
January 1989, compared with NARAL PAC's $591,000.
   But when the steady fund raising of Voters for Choice is
factored in, the abortion-rights forces have a clear fund-raising
advantage.
   Voters for Choice has raised $577,000 in the past 16 months. It
has made donations to a dozen candidates so far this year while
spending the bulk of its money on new fund-raising appeals.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people demanded
the resignation of interim President Ion Iliescu on Sunday in one
of the largest anti-Communist demonstrations in Timisoara since the
December revolution.
   In Bucharest, an anti-government protest in downtown University
Square entered its eighth day with up to 10,000 people taking part.
   Similar protests occurred in other parts of the country, and one
large pro-Iliescu rally was reported in Transylvania.
   Timisoara, in western Romania, is the cradle of the popular
uprising that toppled hard-line Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu on Dec. 22. It is described as Romania's ``martyr city''
because of the blood that was shed there during clashes between
demonstrators and Ceausescu's security forces.
   ``Down with Iliescu! Down with communism!'' shouted the 40,000
people who overflowed Victory Squrare in Timisoara, 300 miles west
of the capital. The square was the site of fierce fighting during
the December revolution.
   Others shouted: ``If we vote for Iliescu, it's like voting for
Ceausescu.''
   Iliescu is a running for president in the May 20 election, and
his National Salvation Front has dominated the interim government
that will run the country until then. He and the Front have often
been the target of protests.
   Observers believe the Front's prominence in the interim
government has given its candidates an advantage in the election,
which is crowded with candidates from dozens of new and
reestablished political parties.
   A former Communist Party secretary under Ceausescu, Iliescu fell
out of favor with the former dictator and was given relatively
unimportant party posts. He gained prominence during the December
revolution, the most violent of the pro-democracy revolts that
swept through Eastern Europe last year.
   Romanians seeking Iliescu's resignation accuse him and others in
the National Salvation Front of seeking to reestablish some form of
communism in the country, despite repeated assertions that the
Front embraces democracy.
   Several thousand people also demonstrated against Iliescu in the
Black Sea port of Constanta on Sunday, state radio reported.
   The state news agency Rompres said that tens of thousands of
Iliescu supporters attended a campaign rally for him in the
Transylvanian city of Cluj. It said anti-Iliescu protesters
gathered in the city afterward.
   In Bucharest, protesters vowed to continue their vigil until the
May 20 election. Protesters in the capital waved banners
proclaiming the square a ``Neo-Communism-Free Zone.''
   A speaker at the Bucharest rally, Stelian Tanase of the Group
for Social Dialogue, said of the government: ``They are offering us
communism in a sweet box. ... We want sweeping changes, not
perestroika,'' a reference to the economic and political reforms
being tried in the Soviet Union.
   A government spokesman, who requested anonymity, described the
Bucharest protest as a ``demonstration of the extreme right.''
   Many protesters in Timisoara wore badges saying, ``I'm a thug,''
a defiant allusion Iliescu's description of the Bucharest
demonstrators as ``thugs.''
   ``If Iliescu does not go, it would be a betrayal of the
revolution,'' one of the protesters, Dana Serbac said. ``If he
stays, it would be a waste of blood spilled here last December.''
   Immediately after the revolution, Romanian and foreign media
said up to 4,000 people died in Timisoara in clashes with
Ceausescu's Securitate troops. But Romanian officials later said
that only about 100 people died in Timisoara.
   Several speakers at the rally on Sunday accused Iliescu of
hiding the real death toll of the revolution. Some of them said
that under Iliescu, former Ceausescu loyalists still hold senior
administrative positions.
   Doina Cornea, one of the speakers and a former prominent member
of the National Salvation Front, said in an interview that she left
the organization in January ``because it abuses its ruling position
to grab power.''
   Cornea, a popular former dissident, also accused Iliescu of
being ``a Soviet man,'' claiming that the Soviet Union is
supporting him in order to bring communism back to Romania.
   Anti-Soviet sentiment was rife at the Timisoara rally too, with
the crowd chanting ``Iliescu-KGB!'' and ``Russians, Forget About
Romania!''
   George Zurebie, a National Peasants Party leader, accused
Iliescu in an interview of ``doing nothing'' to uncover members of
the hated Securitate secret police who have allegedly eluded
authorities.

<HEAD>Senators Urge Ban on Court-Ordered Tax Increases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Conservative senators, reacting to a Supreme
Court decision they say gives too much power to federal judges, are
calling for a constitutional amendment to prohibit courts from
ordering local officials to raise taxes.
   ``If the American people are to be taxed, they are to be taxed
only by those who are elected,'' Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., told
the Senate last week as he sought to build support for the measure.
   The proposed amendment was introduced by Danforth and fellow
Missouri Republican Christopher Bond on April 20, two days after
the high court ruled in a Missouri case that a federal judge has
the power to order a local government to increase taxes.
   In a 5-4 ruling, the justices said U.S. District Court Judge
Russell G. Clark had the authority in a 1987 case to order Kansas
City school officials to ignore a state law limiting property taxes
and direct them raise taxes to pay for a court-ordered
desegregation plan.
   Clark ordered a doubling of local property taxes to finance $260
million in renovations in predominantly black schools after voters
in the school district had repeatedly rejected proposals to raise
taxes for education.
   ``A local government with taxing authority may be ordered to
levy taxes in excess of the limit set by state statute where there
is reason based in the Constitution for not observing the statutory
limitation,'' Justice Byron R. White wrote for the high court.
   Danforth's proposed constitutional amendment has attracted 17
Senate co-sponsors, including one Democrat. Sen. James Exon,
D-Neb., said he might add his name to the list ``after I know more
about it.''
   Amending the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority in each
house of Congress, or 67 votes in the Senate and 290 votes in the
House of Representatives. In addition, the amendment would have to
be ratified by three-fourths or 38 of the nation's 50 states within
seven years of congressional approval.
   Thus far no Senate committee action on the proposed amendment is
planned, although the sponsors have requested a hearing before the
Judiciary Committee.
   While there is no indication Danforth's measure will gain the
support it needs for Senate approval in the near future, the number
of co-sponsors shows the concern that the court's ruling has raised
among conservatives.
   ``This is the ultimate excess of judicial activism,'' said Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who introduced a separate measure of his
own that would prohibit judges by statute from ordering tax
increases.
   Danforth took the Senate floor three times last week to denounce
the decision.
   He said the court has transformed the principle of ``no taxation
without representation'' into ``little more than a quaint relic of
our past, something that went out with powdered wigs and hoop
skirts and horses and buggies.''
   ``When the Supreme Court of the United States decides that a
federal district judge can direct the imposition of taxes, the
Supreme Court is turning on its head one of the most basic premises
that we hold in this country,'' he said.
   Also co-sponsoring the measure are Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.,
and Republican Sens. Bob Dole and Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas,
Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, Steve Symms and James McClure of Idaho,
Pete Wilson of California, John McCain of Arizona, Don Nickles of
Oklahoma, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Dan
Coats of Indiana, Connie Mack of Florida, Orrin Hatch and Jake Garn
of Utah, Conrad Burns of Montana and Alfonse D'Amato of New York.

<HEAD>Bomb Explodes At Customs Post; Fears Mount About New IRA Offensive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded Sunday at a
border customs post, and security forces tipped to a renewed Irish
Republican Army offensive were on increased alert throughout
Northern Ireland.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said the bomb caused minor damage
to a hut in the customs complex near the town of Newry, about 35
miles southwest of Belfast, on the border with the Irish Republic.
No injuries were reported.
   The IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing. In a statement
to news media, it said two unexploded devices remained at the post.
   It was the fifth bomb-related incident reported by police in the
past two days in Northern Ireland.
   The incidents follow a public warning issued Thursday by
Northern Ireland's police headquarters, which said it had received
intelligence reports that the IRA planned a heightened offensive.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Protestant-dominated
Northern Ireland and unite it with the overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic Irish Republic.
   Also Sunday, police said two motorists escaped serious injury
when they drove over two bombs planted in the road at Castlewellan,
south of Belfast.
   An army bomb disposal officer who defused the devices said it
was a ``miracle that these dangerous bombs did not go off as a
couple of cars drove over them.''
   On Saturday, security forces defused a 900-pound bomb left in an
abandoned van on a housing estate in Dungannon, about 35 miles west
of Belfast, the Royal Ulster Constabulary said.
   Lawmaker Ken Maginnis of the moderate, largely Protestant Ulster
Unionist Party said if the bomb left on the housing estate had
exploded, ``there would have been multiple deaths and serious
injuries.''
   Police said four masked men hijacked the van from a family
before planting the bomb. A spokesman said it was unclear who the
intended victim was.
   Dungannon, almost evenly divided between Protestants and
Catholics, has frequently been the target of IRA bombs and there
have been many attacks on its police station.
   Another bomb was found on a bus traveling from central Belfast
to the city's Aldergrove Airport, and police said without
elaborating that a woman was being held for questioning.
   A bomb attached to a lamppost in Lisburn, south of Belfast,
exploded Saturday while police and British army troops evacuated
the area.
   More than 2,700 people have been killed in Northern Ireland
since British troops arrived in August 1969 to separate rioting
Protestants from their Catholic neighbors.

   With surprising speed, the European
Community has launched a drive for political union, with little or
no idea of the final outcome.
   Will the 12 separate nations, with their various languages and
cultures, eventually merge into a sort of United States of Europe?
   Or will they limit themselves to closer cooperation in foreign
and security matters?
   At the end of a special one-day summit in Dublin Saturday, the
leaders themselves appeared at odds over what they had agreed to do.
   ``Clearly, they do not quite know what political union means,''
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said of her colleagues in
the trading bloc. ``It astounds me.''
   European unity was a dream born from the rubble of World War II
and led to formation of the European Community in 1957. Now, with
Eastern Europe in upheaval, Western Europe feels a compulsion to
act as a kind of counterweight, and that means closer ties.
   In their final statement, the leaders said they confirmed their
``commitment to political union.''
   They asked their foreign ministers to draw up models for a
political merger. The proposals will be given to the leaders when
they meet again in Dublin in late June.
   The new impetus for political closeness came from West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand.
   They sent a letter on April 20 to Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey, current EC president, urging fellow leaders to
``accelerate the political construction of the Europe of the
Twelve.''
   They said the issue should be discussed at the unscheduled
summit, called by Haughey to air concerns over German unification.
Kohl later said German unity and European integration were ``two
sides of the same coin.''
   To Kohl and Mitterrand, a political merger means strengthening
the weak Strasboug-based European Parliament and other agencies
that now administer the trading bloc. They also want the bodies
more accountable to the public.
   And they see unity as requiring a common foreign and security
policy.
   To Mrs. Thatcher that sounded ambitious, coming three days after
Kohl and Mitterrand broke ranks with the community over Lithuania.
   The French and West German leaders issued their own statement
calling on the Soviet republic to suspend its March 11 declaration
of independence from Moscow. Just five days earlier, foreign
ministers of the dozen nations carefully crafted a plea for
restraint on both sides.
   ``So there you are ... this is one thing that makes me realize
they will never think of giving up national sovereignty, which I
don't criticize, I'm very pleased about,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   The British leader spelled out what political union shouldn't
mean: Tossing out Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, doing away with
national legislatures, giving up the ability to declare war.
   ``In the ultimate, war or peace is a sovereign decision,'' she
said.
   She also noted the countries maintain different defense postures.
   Ireland is neutral, and France refuses to link its military
forces to the military command of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   ``You simply cannot have a common defense policy in the
community as it is,'' she said.
   Even so, the other leaders appeared intent on coming up with
proposals that would give the community more political muscle.
   Their strength so far has been in the economic area.
   They have mounted a campaign to create a vast market of 320
million consumers by 1993. By then, they intend to eliminate the
many trade barriers preventing the free flow of money, people,
goods and services.
   Already EC nationals can travel without passports among member
countries. There are shared arrangements for health care. Britons
are buying second homes in France in anticipation of an underwater
tunnel that will link the countries in three years.
   The governments intend to create an economic and monetary union,
which would lead to a common currency and a European-wide system of
central banks. They will meet in December to change their founding
Treaty of Rome so they can forge the economic links.
   On Saturday, they decided they almost certainly will do the same
for political union.
   ``We've now embarked on a course of action,'' Haughey said.
``The whole process is now inevitable.''

<HEAD>GOP Still Eyeing Changes in Bill To Extend Rights of Disabled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation that guarantees the civil rights
of millions of disabled Americans heads for a final House committee
hearing this week amid stepped-up attempts by Republicans to change
it.
   The Americans With Disabilities Act commands wide support from
both parties, since only few House members and eight members of the
Senate have been willing to go on record ``against'' people with
handicaps.
   The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to take up the bill
Tuesday and report it to the full House, just as three other House
committees have done. Once the House passes the bill, it must be
reconciled with a version the Senate passed in 1989.
   The act is hailed as the most significant piece of civil rights
legislation since the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned
discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex and
religion.
   The bill guarantees access to transportation, telephone systems
and businesses, professional services and employment. It would, for
instance, make it unlawful to deny a job or a service to someone on
the basis of that person's disability or perceived disability.
   The disabilities that would be covered aren't spelled out, but
testimony and debate make it clear just about anyone with a
debilitating mental or physical condition, including AIDS, is
protected.
   The Library of Congress estimates 43 million Americans are
disabled, but even that list omits large numbers of people who
would fall under the bill's definition.
   But a crack has appeared in the compromise with the White House
that eased the bill through the Senate on a 76-8 vote last
September. The dispute revolves around what sanctions would be
imposed against employers who discriminate.
   Business interests, especially the small-business lobby, are
still pressing to have certain legal terms more precisely defined.
   Small businesses, represented by the National Federation of
Independent Business, want to be exempt from provisions until
regulations are drafted, then tested on larger companies. Further,
they want a tax credit for their troubles.
   Finally, Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif., plans to push an
amendment that would exclude AIDS sufferers from protection.
   In this week's markup, as the hearing is called, the Bush
administration will press its effort to decouple the disabilities
bill from the Civil Rights Act. The two are joined by a reference
in the disabilities bill to Title VII of the 1964 law.
   Title VII governs employment discrimination and spells out
remedies for discrimination: back pay, costs and non-jury trials.
The civil rights advocates who have helped push through the
disabilities bill support another measure, the Civil Rights Act of
1990, that would add damages to the remedies spelled in Title VII.
   Since the ADA defers to Title VII regarding remedies, amending
Title VII would in essence also amend the ADA.
   The administration opposes adding damages to ADA's remedies.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, in a letter March 12 to
lawmakers, said the administration ``will actively support such a
clarifying amendment'' at Tuesday's hearing.
   Without such a change, ``the deal which got the ADA passed in
the other body and won the support of the administration will be
undone,'' Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., said last week
during a Judiciary subcommittee's hearing on the bill.
   Unlike other civil rights bills, the legislation also would
require businesses and transportation providers to spend money on
physical adjustments, such as wheelchair ramps or lifts, and
special services, such as a reader.
   Mary Reed, a lobbyist for the independent business federation,
said that although the bill contains a number of timetables and
exemptions designed to ease its impact on business, critical
changes still are needed.
   Small businesses need to know what is expected of them to comply
so they can avoid lawsuits, she said.
   She also said regulations need to be promulgated and tested by
larger corporations before small businesses, which can't afford
full-time lawyers, can be expected to comply.
   Finally, she said, small businesses need a tax credit to pay for
the adjustments they will need to make to accommodate disabled
customers and employees.

   The white government will meet
with the African National Congress for the first time Wednesday, in
search of ways to share power with South Africa's black majority.
   President F.W. de Klerk and ANC leader Nelson Mandela are
expected to make progress and clear the way for constitutional
talks later this year.
   Mandela and the African National Congress demand an end to the
state of emergency imposed June 12, 1986, release of political
prisoners and other concessions before full negotiations can begin.
   The two sides face enormous challenges in seeking a peaceful,
workable solution to South Africa's racial divisions. Violence is
increasing and elements in both racial groups oppose any settlement.
   Despite their hopes of a solution, de Klerk and Mandela remain
far apart on plans for the new South Africa both say they want to
build. Neither has been able to suggest the differences can be
resolved.
   De Klerk's government expresses support for a democratic system
and ending apartheid, but opposes simple majority rule, contending
that would lead to black domination. De Klerk wants veto power for
whites and safeguards that would preserve much of their wealth and
privilege.
   ``We believe that majority rule is not suitable for a country
like South Africa because it will lead to the domination and even
the suppression of minorities,'' de Klerk told Parliament on April
17.
   ``While we are honest and genuine in our quest to create equal
opportunities for all, we are not prepared to destroy existing
rights or allow them to be destroyed.''
   The ANC remains committed to a one-person, one-vote system with
no special privileges for whites, and refuses to renounce its
guerrilla campaign.
   ANC leaders also must find ways to satsify the needs and
aspirations of millions of impoverished blacks in South Africa,
where blacks outnumber whites more than 5 to 1.
   ``Only successful negotiations can convince us to end the armed
struggle, and peace will come as a result of negotiations,''
Mandela told a rally April 22. ``The armed struggle must be
intensified, but in a disciplined way, to ensure that the
government does not backtrack from the path of negotiation.''
   Other problems include ANC demands that the economy be
nationalized to help poor blacks catch up with whites. The
government and white businessmen oppose any plans for
nationalization or compulsory redistribution of wealth.
   White extremists are arming for what they predict will be a race
war and government officials worry about a violent backlash. The
pro-apartheid Conservative Party, the main white opposition, claims
it would win an election because most whites oppose de Klerk's
plans.
   ``People are arming themselves, said Andries Treurnicht, the
Conservative leader. ``They have the right to protect themselves.''
   Gerrit Viljoen, constitutional development minister,
acknowledged the government wanted quick agreement with the ANC to
avoid a white backlash.
   ``Our approach is, let us do these things as soon as possible so
that people can see the heavens have not fallen in,'' he said.
   The ANC worries about losing support among black militants who
oppose any settlement with the government. Young blacks who control
many of the black townships honor Mandela as a leader, but some
reject his moderate line.
   More radical black groups have criticized Mandela and the ANC
for even negotiating. The Pan African Congress and other militants
say the only thing to be negotiated is the whites' surrender of
power.
   A wave of violence has accompanied the political maneuvering,
most of it fighting between rival black groups. Police report 574
deaths in the first three months of 1990.
   The independent South African Institute for Race Relations said
4,000 people would be killed this year if violence continued at the
current rate. ``Black-on-black violence in South Africa is now
running at its highest level in modern times,'' the institute said.
   Mandela's image has been tarnished by his inability to halt the
violence. Some political observers see the factional warfare as the
start of a struggle for power between black groups divided along
tribal, regional and ideological lines.

   Most of the 17 Western hostages in
Lebanon are believed held by factions of Hezbollah, or Party of
God, a fundamentalist Shiite Moslem group that gets considerable
financial support from Iran.
   Hezbollah works closely with units of Iranian Revolutionary
Guards, stationed in Lebanon since Israel's 1982 invasion, to build
influence among the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect.
   The factions are believed to be closely linked and may even be
largely the same people using different cover names.
   These are the groups claiming to hold the hostages:
   _Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, says it has Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
kidnapped March 16, 1985, and Thomas Sutherland, acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut, abducted June 9
of that year. Anderson has been held longest of the Western
hostages.
   It has demanded the release of 17 comrades jailed in Kuwait for
bombing the U.S. and French embassies in December 1983, some of
whom are believed relatives of Islamic Jihad members. Two of the 17
were released after serving five-year prison terms.
   Speculation has arisen that Islamic Jihad also kidnapped
Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, who disappeared Jan. 23, 1987,
after leaving his hotel in Moslem west Beirut to negotiate the
release of American hostages. No claim of kidnapping has been made.
   _Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine claims to hold
two Americans kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, from the campus of
U.S.-affiliated Beirut University College: Alann Steen, a
communications teacher, and Jesse Turner, a visiting professor of
mathematics and computer science. The group recently released a
third educator, Robert Polhill, a lecturer in accounting.
   It demands the release of Palestinian and Shiite Lebanese
prisoners in Israel.
   _The Revolutionary Justice Organization claimed responsibility
for kidnapping Americans Joseph Cicippio, acting comptroller of the
American University of Beirut, on Sept. 12, 1986, and Edward Tracy,
a self-styled writer and wanderer, on Oct. 19, 1986.
   Statements from the organization threatened the men's lives
twice in 1988 _ first, in retaliation for the U.S. Navy's downing
of an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf in July and second, if
foreign soldiers were sent to Lebanon because of problems over the
election of a president in September.
   _The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed
responsibility for kidnapping Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins on
Feb. 17, 1988, while he served with a U.N. truce observer force,
and said on July 31, 1989, he had been hanged. A videotape was
released July 31, 1989, showing his body hanging from a gallows.
   _Arab Revolutionary Cells-Omar Mukhtar Brigade said it kidnapped
Frank Reed, the American director of the Lebanese International
School, on Sept. 9, 1986.
   _Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems, believed a
cover name for a faction of Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal's
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, claimed to have abducted Alec Collett,
a British journalist on assignment for a U.N. agency.
   Collett was kidnapped March 25, 1985, and the group claimed
April 23, 1986, it hanged him because of British support for U.S.
air raids on Libya eight days earlier. A videotape was released,
showing a body hanging from a scaffold, but no corpse has been
found.
   _Cells of Armed Struggle claimed to have abducted Jack Mann, a
Briton decorated as a fighter pilot in World War II, on May 12,
1989.
   Seven other Westerners are missing and believed kidnapped, but
no organizations have claimed responsibility.

   The World Jewish Congress will hold its first
conference in Germany next week, ending with a ceremony at Wannsee,
the villa where Nazis planned the extermination of European Jews
half a century ago.
   Mass killing of Jews had begun when Reinhard Heydrich and his
companions convened in January 1942, at the elegant villa on a lake
in southwestern Berlin, to work out details of the Final Solution.
   On May 8, World Jewish Congress delegates from around the world
will gather at Wannsee to join their sorrow for the 6 million
Jewish victims to present-day concerns.
   Michel Friedman, a Jewish leader in Frankfurt, spoke of
increased anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union and what he considers
related, worrisome signs in East Germany and Poland.
   ``We see in Eastern Europe that these tendencies recently have
become much more pronounced than would have been thinkable a few
years ago,'' said Friedman, who will attend the WJC conference.
   ``If the past is suppressed, then there is an even greater
danger that things will happen in the present that also must be
condemned.''
   The World Jewish Congress, founded in 1936 in response to
Hitler's threats against Jews, will begin its meeting May 6 in the
West Berlin Jewish community building. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
West Germany is to attend the opening.
   ``One of the intentions of this meeting is to give, from a moral
perspective, a Jewish point of view on the emerging process of
German unification,'' about which Jews have a ``special concern,''
said Elan Steinberg, the WJC executive director. About 500 people
are expected to attend.
   The ceremony at Wannsee will take place on the 45th anniversary
of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender in World War II.
   West Berlin's government is renovating the villa and plans to
open it as a Holocaust memorial Jan. 20, 1992, the 50th anniversary
of the Nazi conference.
   Heydrich, a ranking officer of the Nazi SS, laid out his plans
to about 15 representatives of police agencies and Nazi government
ministries. He said 11 million Jews were to be wiped out.
   Raul Hilberg wrote in his book ``The Annihilation of European
Jews'' that the ``mood was upbeat due to the freely flowing
cognac'' at the two-hour meeting.
   Even before the Wannsee Conference, the Nazis had been
slaughtering Jews in Poland and the Soviet Union, and deportations
had begun.
   Adolf Eichmann, who was to oversee the deportation and murder of
millions of Jews, kept the official record of the Wannsee
proceedings. He was hanged in Israel in 1962 for crimes against the
Jews.
   Hitler did not attend the conference and there has been some
debate of whether he gave direct orders for such a systematic
slaughter.
   As early as January 1939, however, he called publicly for the
``annihilation of the Jewish race throughout Europe.'' Hitler
repeated the call 10 days after the Wannsee Conference.
   ``He knew about it and wanted it,'' said Dieter Senoner, a
spokesman for the Wannsee Villa memorial project. ``There's not the
slightest doubt about that.''
   The Wannsee Villa is between the Alsen Berlin sailing club and
the Sans Souci restaurant in one of Berlin's most popular excursion
spots.
   Many Germans stop outside 56-58 Am Grossen Wannsee and stare at
the sprawling beige villa, which fell into disrepair over decades
and now is being renovated.
   On a warm April day, a young mother stopped with her 10-year-old
daughter and pointed down the driveway to the villa and its
portico, supported by graceful ionic columns.
   ``That's where the National Socialists plotted the killings of
the Jews,'' she told the child somberly.
   Above them was a plaque reading: ``In this house in January
1942, the infamous Wannsee Conference took place. To the memory of
the fellow human beings slain by the Nazi tyranny.''

   With surprising speed, the European
Community has launched a drive for political union, with little or
no idea of the final outcome.
   Will the 12 separate nations, with their various languages and
cultures, eventually merge into a sort of United States of Europe?
   Or will they limit themselves to closer cooperation in foreign
and security matters?
   At the end of a special one-day summit in Dublin Saturday, the
leaders themselves appeared at odds over what they had agreed to do.
   ``Clearly, they do not quite know what political union means,''
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said of her colleagues in
the trading bloc. ``It astounds me.''
   European unity was a dream born from the rubble of World War II
and led to formation of the European Community in 1957. Now, with
Eastern Europe in upheaval, Western Europe feels a compulsion to
act as a kind of counterweight, and that means closer ties.
   In their final statement, the leaders said they confirmed their
``commitment to political union.''
   They asked their foreign ministers to draw up models for a
political merger. The proposals will be given to the leaders when
they meet again in Dublin in late June.
   The new impetus for political closeness came from West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand.
   They sent a letter on April 20 to Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey, current EC president, urging fellow leaders to
``accelerate the political construction of the Europe of the
Twelve.''
   They said the issue should be discussed at the unscheduled
summit, called by Haughey to air concerns over German unification.
Kohl later said German unity and European integration were ``two
sides of the same coin.''
   To Kohl and Mitterrand, a political merger means strengthening
the weak Strasboug-based European Parliament and other agencies
that now administer the trading bloc. They also want the bodies
more accountable to the public.
   And they see unity as requiring a common foreign and security
policy.
   To Mrs. Thatcher that sounded ambitious, coming three days after
Kohl and Mitterrand broke ranks with the community over Lithuania.
   The French and West German leaders issued their own statement
calling on the Soviet republic to suspend its March 11 declaration
of independence from Moscow. Just five days earlier, foreign
ministers of the dozen nations carefully crafted a plea for
restraint on both sides.
   ``So there you are ... this is one thing that makes me realize
they will never think of giving up national sovereignty, which I
don't criticize, I'm very pleased about,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   The British leader spelled out what political union shouldn't
mean: Tossing out Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, doing away with
national legislatures, giving up the ability to declare war.
   ``In the ultimate, war or peace is a sovereign decision,'' she
said.
   She also noted the countries maintain different defense postures.
   Ireland is neutral, and France refuses to link its military
forces to the military command of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   ``You simply cannot have a common defense policy in the
community as it is,'' she said.
   Even so, the other leaders appeared intent on coming up with
proposals that would give the community more political muscle.
   Their strength so far has been in the economic area.
   They have mounted a campaign to create a vast market of 320
million consumers by 1993. By then, they intend to eliminate the
many trade barriers preventing the free flow of money, people,
goods and services.
   Already EC nationals can travel without passports among member
countries. There are shared arrangements for health care. Britons
are buying second homes in France in anticipation of an underwater
tunnel that will link the countries in three years.
   The governments intend to create an economic and monetary union,
which would lead to a common currency and a European-wide system of
central banks. They will meet in December to change their founding
Treaty of Rome so they can forge the economic links.
   On Saturday, they decided they almost certainly will do the same
for political union.
   ``We've now embarked on a course of action,'' Haughey said.
``The whole process is now inevitable.''

<HEAD>Marketplace Gives Long-Neglected Little Haiti a Boost</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The opening of the colorful, tin-roofed Caribbean
Marketplace this month in Little Haiti was good news for an ethnic
group more often linked to crisis and turmoil in the headlines.
   Community leaders and residents hope the 10,000-foot structure
with gingerbread woodwork and a soaring atrium will be a
centerpiece of the area and spark a neighborhood economic revival.
   Although not a large project physically, ``psychologically it's
a huge one,'' said Carl Craig, vice chairman of the Haitian Task
Force, a not-for-profit community agency and developer of the $1.2
million center.
   ``This is one step for us. Out of that marketplace, a lot of
other things will start happening. ... This is the turning point.''
   Its effect is already noticeable in this impoverished,
long-neglected area of northern Miami.
   Since the marketplace broke ground a year ago, plans have been
announced for several other projects nearby.
   ``We feel in the long run, as these projects are developed and
continued ... we'll enhance how the community looks as well as
create jobs and develop marketable skills,'' said Henri-Robert
Lamothe, task force executive director.
   Craig hopes the marketplace will finally bring the Haitain
community some publicity that doesn't focus on its problems.
   Recent stories have focused on alleged abuse at the Immigration
and Naturalization Service detention camp south of Miami that
houses mostly Haitian immigrants; on a U.S. Food and Drug
Administration ban, now under review, on Haitian immigrants giving
blood as a precaution against spreading AIDS; on continuing
instability in the Haitian government; and on the interdiction of
rickety vessels carrying desperate refugees to Florida shores.
   The marketplace, modeled after the Iron Market in
Port-au-Prince, Haiti, is painted in bold yellow with accents in a
rainbow of colors.
   Six years in the developing, it houses vendors selling
island-oriented goods from clothes to books to tropical-flavored
ice cream.
   Nearly all of the 23 stalls, which rent for $300 to $675 a
month, are taken, most by first-time business owners helped with
task force loans and technical assistance.
   Guy Gelin, a Haitian immigrant who moved to South Florida from
New York in 1981, set up his Sunshine Arts &amp; Crafts store at the
marketplace entrance. He specializes in selling Haitian art here,
while his wife runs an art and flower store in Port-au-Prince.
   ``I don't expect a big start,'' Gelin said on a recent slow
weekday afternoon. ``I think it will take at least six months to
one year for business to be booming. But I feel very good about
prospects for the Caribbean Marketplace.''
   Christiane Joseph, who arrived from Haiti 10 years ago, sells
fabric from rolls tucked into a back corner of the breezy
marketplace. She says she's happy to be in full-time sales, away
from the sporadic world of flea-markets.
   The hopes aren't restricted to Haitians. The Okonma family, who
emigrated from Africa via Chicago, has opened the Liberty Fruits &amp;
Vegetables store.
   ``Without them (the task force), you can do it, but it would
have taken more time and frustration,'' said Tony Okonma.
   Most of the business is expected to come from Little Haiti's
residents. But the task force also hopes to attract tourists and
visitors from other parts of the city.
   Lamothe says there are ``few people who can understand what
Haitians are all about and many Haitians who do not venture outside
this enclave,'' so the marketplace could help foster better ethnic
relations all around.
   The marketplace, built with funds from numerous sources,
including the city, the state and the Ford Foundation, has won
several design awards.
   But one local resident hailed it on opening day, April 7, as
something more.
   ``This place means Haitian pride,'' the man, who gave his name
only as Boulou, told The Miami Herald. ``When we come to this
country we have to fight for it, but now it's standing right here
in front of us.''

   In one corner, there's Sen. John D.
Rockefeller IV, heir to one of America's biggest fortunes and
holding a $2.1 million PAC-packed war chest, seeking nomination to
a second six-year term.
   In the others stand an art professor who refuses to campaign and
a self-proclaimed inventor-lawyer who doesn't do interviews.
   Jay Rockefeller has spent $300,000 so far in the race to the May
8 Democratic primary. The art professor, Paul Nuchims, has spent
less than $500.
   A fourth candidate withdrew, saying he couldn't afford to
challenge Rockefeller.
   The winner faces Republican John Yoder, 39, a Harpers Ferry
lawyer and a onetime aide to former Chief Justice Warren Burger, in
November.
   Yoder has dubbed Rockefeller ``PAC man of the year.''
   But Rockefeller claims the money won't sway him.
   ``I think the one really clear thing about Jay Rockefeller that
the people of West Virginia understand extremely well is that the
only boss that Jay Rockefeller has, the only accountability he has,
is to the people,'' he said in a recent telephone interview.
   Rockefeller, 52, great-grandson of Standard Oil founder John D.
Rockefeller and nephew of Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller,
moved to Appalachia in 1964 to fight poverty, then moved into
politics. A former two-term West Virginia governor, he narrowly won
election to the Senate in 1984.
   Rockefeller cites among his accomplishments in office pushing
for drug education in schools and enactment of a law requiring U.S.
automakers to develop vehicles that run on methanol, which is made
partly from coal _ which is important to West Virginians.
   As a freshman senator, Rockefeller generally has voted as a
liberal, opposing the Strategic Defense Initiative and aid to the
Nicaraguan Contras but supporting the minimum wage increase and
60-day notice for plant closings.
   In West Virginia, he has been attacked for advocating Japanese
investment in the United States, which critics say jeopardizes
America's independence.
   To that, he answers: ``When foreign investment, from whatever
source, puts West Virginians to work, then I say it can be good for
West Virginia.''
   But the biggest complaints about Rockefeller since he entered
state politics have focused on his money. His campaigns have earned
him a name as a free-spending scion who buys his way into office.
   He spent $9 million in his 1980 gubernatorial run and $12
million in the 1984 Senate race.
   This time, he has raised $2.1 million, including $800,000 from
political action committees, according to campaign financial
statements.
   Nuchims, 55, of St. Albans, says his biggest donation to date
was $50. He said he's opposing Rockefeller just ``to get the ideas
out to the people.''
   A one-time gubernatorial candidate, Nuchims has refused to
campaign, choosing instead to exhibit his politically oriented
artwork.
   ``I do not wish power or glory, but somebody has to exude some
modicum of leadership for the state. West Virginia is, economically
and leadership-wise, bankrupt,'' he said.
   Chairman of the art department at West Virginia State College,
Nuchims says he supports a national education policy, competency
testing for teachers and restriction of foreign investment.
   The other candidate, Ken B. Thompson, of Morgantown, did not
return numerous telephone calls and has no listed campaign
headquarters. He did, however, tell one newspaper by mail that he
is a former U.S. State Department aide, a lawyer and an inventor.
   Rockefeller chaired the Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive
Health Care, also called the Pepper Commission, which recommended a
jobs-based universal health insurance plan.
   It called for full coverage for everyone within five years and
said employers would have to provide insurance or contribute to a
public plan.
   But the commission refused to include recommendations on how to
pay the estimated $23 billion cost.

   Now that the Hubble Space Telescope
is circling the world to look for secrets of the universe, NASA is
busy with plans to put three other major observatories in orbit
this decade.
   Hubble is the flagship of what have become known as The Great
Observatories. The next to be launched is the Gamma Ray
Observatory, scheduled to head into space aboard the shuttle
Atlantis in November. It will investigate matter at extreme
temperatures and pressure where nuclear synthesis is occurring.
   The Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility is due to go up in
1997, followed by the Space Infrared Telescope Facility in 1998.
   Each observatory will operate far above Earth's obstructing
atmosphere and thus provide views of the universe unachievable by
the best telescope on the highest peak.
   ``The Great Observatories are moving us into a new order of
magnitude of the parts of the universe that we can study, so we're
almost guaranteed having whole new worlds of study opened up to us.
They're things we just never could look at before,'' said astronaut
Jeffrey Hoffman.
   Hoffman is one of four astronomers slated to fly aboard the
shuttle Columbia next month with a $100 million observatory called
Astro.
   Astro's four scientific instruments will measure ultraviolet and
X-ray radiation during the nine-day flight, the first Spacelab
mission since 1985.
   ``The most significant thing is that this (Astro) covers a part
of the spectrum that Hubble can't touch,'' said Frank Six, a senior
scientist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   One of its targets will be Comet Austin, believed to be on its
first trip through the solar system. Halley's Comet would have been
observed if Astro had gone up as planned right after the 1986
Challenger mission that ended in tragedy.
   Interstellar space dust _ difficult to see and measure because
it's dark _ also will be studied by Astro. Astronomers have no idea
how much there is or how much it contributes to the total mass of
the universe.
   ``It doesn't sound very romantic to say you're studying dirt,
but that's basically one of the fundamental things we're looking
at, cosmic dirt,'' Hoffman said.
   Launch of Columbia is targeted for May 16. Two weeks later, NASA
plans to launch a Delta 2 rocket carrying a German X-ray
observatory known as Rosat. And in August 1991, the agency will
send up the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer, also on a Delta.
   The observatories, great and small, will complement one another
and help astronomers determine how and when the cosmos came to be
and whether other stars have planets.
   Astro, for example, will provide ultraviolet targets for Hubble
during the telescope's planned 15-year lifetime.
   ``Astronomers would never survive with just one telescope or one
sort of telescope. There are always new ideas,'' said astronaut
Robert Parker, an astronomer on the Astro mission.
   Following Columbia's flight with Astro, the shuttle launch
schedule for 1990 is:
   July 9 _ Atlantis, with a classified Defense Department payload.
   Aug. 29 _ Columbia, with a space life science laboratory for
biological research.
   Oct. 5 _ Discovery, which will unleash the space probe Ulysses
to explore the sun's polar regions.
   Nov. 1 _ Atlantis, to deploy the Gamma Ray Observatory.
   Dec. 12 _ Columbia, on the first International Microgravity
Laboratory mission.

   Thousands of workers and students
fought running street battles with riot police Sunday, and a
dissident labor group called for sympathy strikes to protest a
police raid on a strike-bound shipyard.
   In Seoul and elsewhere, radical students staged violent street
demonstrations in protest against the raid Saturday that crushed a
three-day strike at the world's largest shipyard, the Hyundai Heavy
Industries Co. complex in this port city 200 miles southeast of
Seoul.
   Police reported some injuries and arrests but gave no overall
figures.
   In Ulsan, scattered street fighting continued amid a dense fog
of tear gas near the shipyard throughout Sunday as about 3,000
workers staged running battles with riot police.
   Groups of up to 200 workers attacked police with firebombs,
rocks and other projectiles after grouping in alleyways near the
shipyard. Some workers used slingshots to shoot rocks at the
police, who retaliated with tear gas.
   ``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo!'' workers shouted as they
raised clenched fists into the air.
   At one point, about 300 riot police were driven by workers into
a small factory, where they were cut off for more than one hour.
Workers blocked the exit by piling broken furniture at the plant's
gate and setting it on fire. The police were later rescued by
colleagues.
   Angry workers also used firebombs to torch a janitor's office at
a Hyundai subsidiary near the shipyard.
   Some residents, believed to be families of shipyard workers,
jeered at police. A young woman, carrying a baby on her back,
pelted police with several eggs.
   A police helicopter flew overhead.
   Police in Ulsan and other industrial regions were put on an
increased state of alert Sunday as a major dissident labor
federation called for a nationwide general strike Tuesday, the May
Day workers' holiday, in support of the Hyundai shipyard workers.
   The National Consultative Council of Labor Unions, which claims
a membership of 180,000, issued the strike appeal, charging the
police raid on the shipyard reflected a new government crackdown on
labor.
   The government has vowed to deal firmly with the current wave of
labor unrest, saying the survival of the national economy is at
stake.
   Government officials say illegal strikes, steep wage increases
and the rise of the South Korean currency, the won, against the
dollar have hurt the ability of South Korea's export-driven economy
to compete overseas.
   Labor leaders maintain that the government of President Roh
Tae-woo is more repressive than past authoritarian regimes and has
unfairly imprisoned more than 200 union activists since taking
office in 1988, a figure which could not be verified.
   The shipyard strike began Wednesday when about 20,000 workers
walked off the job, demanding that four union leaders jailed in
earlier protests be released. The company maintains judicial
matters are out of its control.
   Wage negotiations were scheduled to begin Friday, but workers
said wages were not a main issue in the strike.
   When about 13,000 riot police stormed the Ulsan shipyard at dawn
Saturday, all but a few hundred of the 2,000 striking workers
inside fled. About 150 climbed atop a 240-foot crane but their
number decreased to 50 by Sunday, reports said.
   They hung a huge banner reading, ``Let's win collective
bargaining and achieve our dream of owning houses.''
   The shipyard, the world's largest with $1.5 billion in sales
last year, has 24,000 workers on its payroll. It is a subsidiary of
the giant Hyundai group, which produces cars, computers, steel and
other goods.
   In Seoul, about 1,000 radical students, hurling hundreds of
firebombs, attacked police substations and battled riot police on
Sunday, scaring holiday shoppers and temporarily paralyzing traffic
along a main boulevard.
   ``Let's crush the Roh regime suppressing the labor movement!''
students shouted.
   Riot police fired tear gas but the students regrouped in
alleyways and charged police repeatedly. Several students were seen
being taken away.
   Other protests took place in the southern cities of Kwangju and
Pusan.

   What goes around came around during a
national boomerang competition.
   The fifth annual Spring Fling competition, sponsored by the
South Georgia Boomerang Club, included events that focused on
catching ability, distance and accuracy skills. In each event,
competitors used different kinds of boomerangs.
   Enthusiasts even indulged in some sloganeering.
   ``Boomerangs ... as American as Kangaroos,'' read one.
   Another said the boomerang _ a flat, curved stick that usually
returns near the point it was thrown _ is ``the Thinking Person's
Frisbee.''
   Linda Maultsby of Chapel Hill, N.C., said the competitions bring
little in the way of riches. Prizes usually are trophies, or
another boomerang.
   Mrs. Maultsby said even Chet Snouffer, the current Boomerang
World Champion who has traveled to Australia, France and Sweden for
tournaments and won three consecutive national competitions, hasn't
gotten rich, either.
   ``I don't even think Chet could make a living doing it _ there's
not much money in it,'' she said.

   The world's highest garbage will soon go to the
highest bidder.
   The Mount Everest International Peace Climb, which expects to
reach the top of the world's highest mountain in early May, will be
picking up debris that previous climbing expeditions left behind.
   The climbers estimate they can fill more than 50 bags with
mountaineering garbage. Expedition leader Jim Whittaker said the
climbing teams hope to sell the stuff at auction.
   ``We've decided to pick up some of the older stuff, from the
24,000-foot level, and ship it back and have an auction,''
Whittaker said. ``I think people would really like to have a trophy
from the highest place in the world.''
   Two three-person teams of American, Soviet and Chinese climbers
will attempt to reach the top of 29,028-foot Mount Everest, the
world's highest mountain, on May 6. On May 7, two more climbers
from each country will try to reach the summit. On May 8, a third
party will try for the top.

   ``No show runs forever,'' says one of the
dancers in ``A Chorus Line.'' After 15 years and 6,137
performances, that finally came true for the longest running show
in Broadway history.
   The show about dancers auditioning for a big Broadway musical
closed Saturday night with a tearful and highly charged performance
that had theatergoers cheering even before the evening started.
   When people entered the Shubert Theater they were greeted by a
neon sign showing the number of performances. They yelled when the
house lights went down, and every musical number was greeted by
prolonged applause.
   There were bravos for Laurie Gamache, who plays Cassie, when she
finished her solo dance number ``The Music and the Mirror.'' And
the audience roared its approval during the entire finale when all
the dancers, dressed in gold costumes, high kicked their way
through ``One.''
   When the applause finally stopped, producer Joseph Papp appeared
for a roll call of the dancers in the current production and most
of original 1975 cast, who also were brought on stage.
   ``This show is dedicated to anyone who has ever danced in a
chorus or marched in step anywhere,'' Papp said. ``Take a final bow
`Chorus Line.'''
   He also lauded the musical's creative team, Nicholas Dante and
James Kirkwood, who wrote the book; Marvin Hamlisch, who composed
the music, and Ed Kleban, who did the lyrics.
   Most touching were the tears and applause for Michael Bennett,
the show's director and choreographer, who died of AIDS in 1987 at
the age of 44. When a huge black and white photo of Bennett
appeared as a backdrop, the audience and cast members clapped
wildly.
   The final performance started nearly a half-hour late as people
surged in front of the theater in the heart of the Broadway theater
district. Police closed off part of 44th Street to accommodate the
crowds.
   The sold-out evening benefited the New York Shakespeare
Festival, which produced the musical. Tickets were priced from $80
to $500, and many were bought by people who had seen the musical
over and over again.
   Perhaps the record holders were Stephen and Betty Cockayne of
Nottingham, England, who caught both the Saturday matinee and
evening performances. Cockayne has now seen the musical 338 times,
mostly during the show's London run.
   Fans gathered around the stage door to applaud cast members as
they left after the performance for a party at Mama Leone's. Some
800 guests were invited to the celebration, which took over three
floors at the theater district restaurant.
   ``A Chorus Line'' originally was set to close at the end of
March, but Papp pushed the final performance back four weeks
because of a surge in ticket sales.
   The show, based on some 40 hours of taped conversations by
dancers, started performances in April 1975 at the Shakespeare
Festival's Newman Theater off-Broadway. It moved to Broadway on
July 25, 1975, and has been at the Shubert Theater ever since.
   ```A Chorus Line' truly is an amazing show,'' says Tom Porter,
its veteran production stage manager, who supervised the musical
one last time Saturday night. ``Think how many other shows have
opened and closed during its 15-year run. I think that's why it was
very hard to realize that it was closing. After a while, you
thought it will be here forever.''
   For the dancers, the end came gradually over the last week. Most
already had cleaned out their dressing rooms before the final
curtain.
   And the Shubert already has a new tenant. The theater will
undergo extensive renovation and reopen in October with ``Buddy,''
the hit London musical about the legendary American rock 'n' roll
singer Buddy Holly.

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An exiled white South African priest
known as a African National Congress activist was critically
wounded in a letter bomb explosion at his Harare home, church
officials said Sunday.
   The Anglican Rev. Michael Lapsley lost both hands and an eye in
the explosion late Saturday and underwent emergency surgery in the
main Harare hospital, said a church spokesman who asked not to be
identified.
   The Zimbabwe government confirmed Lapsley had been ``badly
injured'' in the blast, which authorities were investigating. Home
Affairs Minister Moven Mahachi declined to give further details,
and police refused to comment.
   The attack comes just four days before the scheduled start of
talks in South Africa between an ANC delegation headed by Nelson
Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk aimed at removing obstacles to
constitutional negotiations on granting political rights to the
country's black majority.
   The Rev. Desmond Tutu, South Africa's Anglican archbishop,
condemned the letter bombing.
   ``I hope this cruel bombing is not what we suspect it to be _ an
attempt by right-wing elements, possibly with contacts in the
security forces, to sabotage the negotiating process,'' Tutu said
in a statement released by his Cape Town office.
   Lapsley evidently opened the letter bomb at his rented house in
downtown Harare, the Zimbabwean capital, and there were unconfirmed
reports a second person was injured in the explosion.
   The blast ripped through the living room, collapsing the ceiling
and shattering most of the windows of the house.
   The church spokesman described Lapsley as an active ANC member
who was said to have been on a South African ``hit list'' of exiled
opponents.
   ``We are assuming South Africa is involved,'' he said.
   The list named activists at home and abroad said to be the
targets of South African military and security police death squads
now under judicial investigation in South Africa.
   The church spokesman said Lapsley had received death threats in
the past from white South African extremists, and was under police
protection in Harare for the past three years.
   There was no immediate reaction from South African authorities.
   Lapsley, a New Zealand native in his early 40s, was expelled
from South Africa in the late 1970s because of his activities
against the apartheid system of racial separation.
   He settled in Zimbabwe and frequently traveled to the ANC's
exile headquarters in Lusaka in neighboring Zambia.
   Associates said Lapsley officiated at the funerals of several
ANC sympathizers killed in bombing and sabotage attacks on the
guerrilla organization's facilities in black-governed nations
neighboring South Africa.
   The last bombing in Zimbabwe occurred in January 1988 when one
man died in a car bomb blast outside a house occupied by ANC exiles
in the city of Bulawayo.
   Saturday's attack is the first bombing directed at exiled ANC
members since the organization was legalized in South Africa as
part of political reforms announced Feb. 2 by de Klerk.
   Many exiled ANC activists announced plans to return to South
Africa following de Klerk's announcement.
   The Zimbabwe-based church-run Liberation Support Committee said
the bombing demonstrated what it described as ``the violence that
is an integral part of apartheid.''
   ``Despite the attempts of the South African regime to portray
itself as goodwilled ... it is in events such as this attack that
it shows its true colors,'' the statement said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush reacted guardedly Sunday to
reports from Lebanon that kidnappers soon would free another
American hostage, saying only ``that's wonderful'' if it proves
true.
   News of the kidnappers' terse statement promising freedom within
48 hours for educator Frank H. Reed reached Bush as he finished a
rainy outing on a military golf course outside Washington.
   To reporters who asked about the news as the president walked
off the 18th green at the Andrews Air Force Base course, Bush said,
``I've learned not to speculate on the hostages for the reasons I
keep explaining. I just won't say anything. If that proves to be
true, that's wonderful.''
   A White House deputy spokesman, John Herrick, said later, ``We
have no independent confirmation of these reports at this time.''
   Herrick said Bush had received an update from the White House
situation room on the reports of a possible hostage release.
   The kidnappers, in an unsigned statement released in Beirut,
said Reed ``will carry a message addressed to the American
administration'' when he is set free.
   Earlier Sunday, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee, said he is ``very optimistic that
we're going to see more hostages released.''
   Another U.S. hostage, Robert Polhill, 55, was freed April 22
after 39 months in captivity.
   A State Department spokesman, David Denny, said, ``We're
hopeful. We've seen the report. ... We continue to press for
release of all the hostages.''
   Reed, 57, director of the Lebanese International School, was
kidnapped in West Beirut on Sept. 12, 1986, by a previously unknown
group calling itself the Arab Revolutionary Cells-Omar Mukhtar
Brigade.
   The Massachusetts native had lived in Beirut for eight years.
His second wife is a Syrian Moslem and Reed himself is a convert to
Islam.
   Reed is among seven Americans and 17 Westerners still held
hostage in Lebanon. Joseph James Cicippio, an administrator of the
American University of Beirut, was kidnapped on the same day as
Reed.
   Only two hostages have been held longer: Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, a prisoner
since March 16, 1985, and Thomas Sutherland, dean of agriculture at
the American University of Beirut, whose ordeal began on June 9,
1985.
   Polhill, rail-thin after his three-plus years' in captivity, has
been recuperating at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington
after being evacuated from Beirut to Syria to West Germany and on
the United States.
   Boren, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' said economic
pressures on Iran and Syria, including reduced Soviet aid to
Damascus, was causing him to believe the two countries will
pressure the kidnappers to free their hostages.
   Both Syria and Iran ``need a flow of outside investment _ and
they know that will never happen until they release our hostages,''
Boren said. ``I think that kind of pressure will continue if we'll
just be patient.''
   Bush thanked both Syria and Iran for help they rendered in
securing Polhill's release, but said last week, ``This is mission
uncompleted. ... I do not have forgiveness in my heart as long as
one American is held against his will.''
   Bush ruled out any immediate overture to Iran, saying, ``I'm not
making gestures. I don't trade for hostages.''

   Lots of people were on the streets of a
Italian-American enclave when a mob of neighborhood youths stalked,
surrounded and killed a black teen-ager who ventured into their
section to check out a used car.
   But while prosecutors have trotted some three dozen people to
the stand to testify against two alleged members of the gang, only
one person who took the stand said he was an eyewitness. And he has
a history of hallucinations.
   To be sure, the district attorney's menagerie of witnesses was
quite extraordinary _ two jailed con artists who say the accused
triggerman confessed to them, a young woman portrayed as being at
the crime's vortex and a young man who said he didn't bother to
look when someone opened fire only a few feet from him.
   Only Franklin Tighe recalled seeing the incident. He testified
that defendant Joseph Fama pulled ``a shiny, silver metal handgun .
.. four shots were fired ... toward the black youth.''
   Tighe said he watched last Aug. 23 as 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins
fell mortally wounded to the sidewalk and the white mob ran.
   Fama's defense lawyer, David DePetris, maintains Tighe was
hallucinating. The 20-year-old told doctors a few years ago he was
being controlled by helicopters hovering over the neighborhood.
   Fama and fellow defendant Keith Mondello, both 19, are on trial
in Brooklyn state Supreme Court for two counts of murder each and
other crimes in the attack, which law enforcers characterize as
racially motivated.
   Six other young Bensonhurst residents will be tried later.
   Prosecutors are convinced from admissions by participants in the
attack and from statements by neighbors who watched that there are
many witnesses who could name names and say exactly what happened
when Hawkins and his three black friends were attacked.
   Throughout the trial, prosecutors have been frustrated by what
Assistant District Attorney Edward Boyar termed the ``hear no evil,
see no evil, speak no evil'' ethic of the close-knit Brooklyn
enclave.
   Christopher Lomuto, a 10th-grader who's lived most of his life
in Bensonhurst, announced the murder to much of the neighborhood,
running down the street yelling ``Someone's been shot,'' several
witnesses testified.
   On the stand, Lomuto admitted he had seen many of the events of
that night. But he defiantly told Boyar: ``I didn't see anybody's
face. ... It was dark out.''
   Carmen Mercado, a longtime Bensonhurst resident, said that on
the day before the incident she had sent her 14-year-old daughter
out of the neighborhood because she'd heard rumors of trouble.
   About 10 days after the killing, Ms. Mercado told police what
she saw. A few days later, Boyar said, she began receiving
threatening phone calls in the middle of the night. When she took
the witness stand Tuesday, she could recall few details for the
jury.
   One Bensonhurst boy said he was a few feet away from Hawkins
when the shooting started, but testified he didn't turn around to
see who had the gun.
   But the prosecution's star witness was Gina Feliciano, whose
name has been at the center of the murder case since the beginning.
   Sometimes crying, other times snarling, Miss Feliciano testified
about Hawkins' killing on the night of her 18th birthday party.
   On the previous day, she said, Mondello had told her, ``I should
spit in your face, you nigger lover.''
   Mondello's lawyer, Stephen Murphy, who's fashioned much of his
defense around a personal attack on her, called Miss Feliciano, who
has had a drug problem since age 13, a ``crackhead'' and a
``contemptible liar.''
   He blames Miss Feliciano for the killing, saying she stirred up
trouble by telling Mondello that 25 of her black friends were
coming to Bensonhurst on her birthday to beat him up.
   The white mob, Murphy says, mistook Hawkins and his friends for
the expected interlopers.
   Murphy was scheduled to open his defense of Mondello on Monday,
with the Fama defense to follow on Tuesday. The trial judge,
Justice Thaddeus Owens, said he expects to give the case to jurors
May 7.

   There are many similarities between
two mail bombs that exploded in a Texas church in January and at
Christian Broadcasting Network in Virginia last week, a federal
official said Sunday.
   But Paul Lyon, senior agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms in North Carolina, hesitated to say the two mail bombs
are connected.
   ``We see both incidents as _ I don't want to use the word
connected _ let's just say there are sufficicent similarities in
both situations that have caused us to concentrate our
investigation in the Fayetteville-Bladen County area,'' Lyon said
in a telephone interview from his home in Charlotte.
   Both bombs were sent from Bladen County, Lyon and Richard Metz,
senior postal inspector for North Carolina and South Carolina, said
Saturday.
   Lyon said federal officials ``did not want to get into any any
specifics or details about the devices themselves or any
commonalities.''
   Sources told The Fayetteville Observer-Times that both packages
had Fayetteville return addresses. Metz declined to reveal the
addresses but said they were ``in the Fayetteville area.''
   The first bomb exploded in the 10,000-member interdominational
Lakewood Church in northeast Houston in late January. One person
was injured.
   Lyon said an investigation has found that the package bomb was
mailed from the Elizabethtown Post Office in Bladen County on Jan.
26.
   On Friday, a bomb in a package addressed to the Rev. Pat
Robertson at the Christian Broadcasting Co. in Virginia Beach, Va.,
exploded in the mailroom when it was opened by a security guard.
The guard was hospitalized with shrapnel wounds in one leg.
   Metz said that package was mailed from the Bladenboro Post
Office on April 20.
   Metz and Lyon said their offices had been in contact with
Cumberland County Sheriff Morris Bedsole since Friday because of
the connection with the bombings and because of services conducted
by television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart on Friday and Saturday at
the Cumberland County Civic Auditorium.
   Bedsole said security around the evangelist was increased after
the news of the Virginia Beach bombing. No problems were reported.
   A $50,000 reward has been offered in the Houston bombing. There
will be an additional reward in connection with the Virginia Beach
bombing, Metz said.
   Lyon said he does not believe either bomb is connected with any
other mail bombs.

   One hundred and fifty mail-order cowboys
got to live out their fantasies about life in the Old West as they
headed 'em up and moved 'em out on a longhorn cattle drive at the
Y.O. Ranch.
   The participants had all purchased places on Saturday's drive
through the 1989 Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog, known for its
unusual and expensive offerings.
   ``I feel like a little kid living `Cheyenne,' like any minute
James Arness or Clint Walker is going to come riding up the hill.
I'm having a ball,'' said Peggy Weitzmann of Englewood, N.J.
   ``It's kind of like a time warp. It's like stepping into
America's past,'' said Margie Crane, a housewife from Charlotte,
N.C.
   Well, actually there were a few modern intrusions, like the
portable toilets along the cattle trail.
   Doctors, psychologists, college professors and businessmen from
25 states and Canada were among those who paid $627 to $767 each
for the magazine's offer to ``saddle up and ride into history.''
The 150 slots available for the roundup sold out in two hours, said
Pat Zajac of Neiman Marcus.
   The roundup marked the 110th anniversary of the 40,000-acre Y.O.
Ranch, where more than 1,000 longhorns roam.
   Early Saturday, the greenhorns swaggered out to the corral, many
of them wearing new leather chaps, cowboy hats and dusters.
   But some seemed to hesitate when it came time to actually get on
a horse.
   ``Is it anything like riding a dirt bike?'' asked Wade Moody of
Fort Worth.
   ``I've already signed up for my massage,'' said Marky Liston of
New York City.
   Gaylon Young, an insurance salesman from Arlington, was one of
about a dozen who ate dirt instead of staying in the saddle.
   ``I jumped off and swapped horses,'' Young said.
   One woman got a slight concussion when she toppled backwards _
and her horse landed on top of her. But like everyone else who took
tumbles, she got back in the saddle later in the day.
   In all 400 riders and ranch hands, two covered wagons and a
stage coach finally hit the trail, driving about 75 longhorns _
steers that ranch hands said they had been ``gentling down'' all
week.
   The drive was led by Kenny House, a 74-year-old deputy U.S.
marshal from Dodge City, Kan., where the Western Trail, the cattle
trail that started at the Y.O., ended in the old days.
   Most of the would-be cowboys looked fairly authentic, except for
a few with designer purses looped over their saddle horns. Some
said they were used to riding polo ponies or hunted at home.
   Despite a few mishaps and complaints that cowboys outnumbered
cows 6-to-1, almost everyone said they were satisfied.
   ``I think the old West might have been a little different from
this, but it's fun,'' said Carolyn Simon of Augusta, Ga.
   Stephen Henson, an ear, nose and throat doctor from Lafayette,
Ind., said the chance to fulfill his ``lifelong dream'' to be a
cowboy made him yearn to punch cattle full-time, although the
technological age intruded in his wishes.
   ``I'm going to turn in my resignation when I get home. I might
even fax it, if they've got one back at the ranch,'' he said.

   The slaughter of wild burros in the
foothills of the Black Mountains has revived the controversy over
their place in the delicate desert environment.
   One or more sharpshooters killed 51 of the animals recently,
about one-third of a herd in a remote area 15 miles southwest of
here in northwestern Arizona. Their bodies were found during the
week of April 16-20.
   Investigators said most were killed by a shot to the head, with
small-caliber rifles fired from 100 to 300 yards away.
   ``It was done by a professional, there is no doubt,'' said Karen
Sussman, president of the International Society for the Protection
of Mustangs and Burros. ``The shooting was indiscriminate _ they
shot mares about to give birth, young foals, adult burros, all of
them.''
   Her organization is offering $5,000 for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of the killers.
   Burros are not native to North America but are descended from
pack animals abandoned or lost by miners. Critics say they compete
with both native species and livestock for space, water and food.
Wildlife advocates have criticized their effects on endangered
species such as the desert tortoise.
   Until 1971, feral burros and horses were routinely killed by
ranchers and hunters. Then a public outcry resulted in the Wild and
Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act.
   They were declared ``living symbols of the historic and pioneer
spirit of the West'' and placed under federal protection. Penalties
for killing them range as high as a $2,000 fine and a year in jail
per burro killed.
   Ranchers' perspectives on the issue were illustrated by a letter
which the Mohave Daily Miner published Friday from Jennifer
Chambers.
   ``I do not condone the recent method of elimination of the
burro, but I can understand the reasoning behind the action,'' she
wrote.
   ``Burros can be mean, kicking and biting ... (and) are also very
destructive, especially with water sources which in this area are
vital to the lives of wild animals in the desert. Burros will
trample a water hole into a muddy mess and, to put it politely,
relieve themselves, thus rendering the water unfit ... to drink.''
   Ms. Chambers suggested that the environmentalists arrange with
the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to set aside tracts of land for
burros.
   Ms. Sussman ``and her group could pay to feed the burros and
arrange adoptions and save taxpayer funds,'' added Ms. Chambers,
who did not return calls seeking further comment.
   A motive for the killings was unclear.
   ``There has been controversy, some threats against the burros
from different interests up in that area,'' said Anna Maria Adamo,
a BLM spokeswoman in Phoenix.
   ``But we have carefully controlled the burro herds in this area,
so there would be no conflict with wildlife. And there is no cattle
grazing at all in that area now, so we have no cause to think the
problem is rancher-related,'' she added.
   Officials have estimated there were about 150 burros in the
immediate area of the killings and an additional 450 in the Black
Mountains. Some hang around the old mining town of Oatman, where
tourists feed them.
   Sources said the carcasses were scattered over an
eight-square-mile area of almost inaccessible terrain.
   ``Given that this area was so remote and that such a large
number of animals was killed, whoever went out there really was
determined to decimate the herd,'' Ms. Adamo said.
   ``This was not just someone off on a lark, sport killing,'' Ms.
Adamo added. ``You know: `I can't find a rabbit to shoot, so I'll
shoot a burro.' This was someone who put a great deal of effort
into getting those animals.''

<HEAD>Police: Troopers Back Away from Arrest After Indian Fires Shot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALTONA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State troopers ``chose not to take a life''
and backed off from arresting a Mohawk Indian after he pointed a
gun at them and another Mohawk fired a shot into the air,
authorities said Sunday.
   The troopers ``were more than justified to return fire at these
people and they didn't,'' said state police Lt. Michael Klusacek.
   But a Mohawk spokesman disputed the account. He said the police
had fired at the Indians, who had not fired at all.
   At about 8:30 p.m. Saturday, troopers pulled over a pickup truck
driven by a Mohawk wanted, with 15 others, for blocking an
investigation into last month's shooting of a military helicopter
over the Ganienkeh Territory near the Canadian border.
   The Mohawk pointed a shotgun at the troopers and turned to run,
said state police Maj. Robert Leu. A second Mohawk standing on a
nearby hill fired one shot into the air from an AK-47 assault
rifle, Leu said.
   Both Indians then fled into the woods, which lead into the
Ganienkeh territory, police said.
   ``One of the most creditable things for our people is that they
chose not to take a life,'' Klusacek said. ``The result may be
different next time. ... Everybody realizes we don't want to start
a war because of a reckless act by an individual who probably
doesn't really understand what he was doing.''
   But Ganienkeh spokesman Darryl Martin said, ``They shot at us.
It's a fact. The police are saying that our people fired on them
and they are lying. They are lying through their teeth.''
   The Ganienkeh territory was quiet Sunday. Roadblocks set up by
troopers and Indians were removed by 12:45 a.m., Klusacek said.
   Tensions have been high there since March 30, when a Vermont
National Guard helicopter made an emergency landing in Ganienkeh
after it was struck by three gunshots. A civilian doctor aboard the
helicopter was hurt.
   The Indians deny the shots came from their land. An armed
standoff lasted 11 days before state and federal investigators were
allowed onto the territory, which the Indians claim is sovereign
land.
   Federal obstruction of justice charges later were filed against
the 16 Mohawks, who failed to turn themselves in by a Wednesday
deadline set by the U.S. attorney in Albany.
   Police said they don't plan to go into the territory after the
suspects.
   ``We have warrants for them and wherever we see them we will
arrest them,'' Klusacek said. ``As to whether we'll try to storm
the reserve, I would say that's a remote possibility.''
   Separately, state police warned gamblers to stay away Saturday
night as one Indian casino reopened for the first time since
gambling opponents blockaded the strife-torn St. Regis Mohawk
reservation, which straddles the U.S.-Canada border.
   Its 14,000 residents are divided over casinos and bingo halls on
the U.S. side.
   The feud also touches on the question of whether state and
federal officials have authority to intervene in a dispute among
Indians.

<HEAD>Hoaxters Send Homeless to Mayor's Doorstep for Food</HEAD>

   The posters in an area where the
homeless usually gather advertised ``Free Food, Anytime of Day or
Night, People's Soup Kitchen'' and displayed a pedestrian map
showing the best route.
   But several hungry people were disappointed when they followed
the path.
   It led to the home of Mayor Loni Hancock, who called the hoax a
``heartless, mean-spirited joke'' after about a dozen people
knocked on her door, starting at 6:30 a.m. Saturday.
   ``We felt sorry for them,'' she said. ``They genuinely needed
food and shelter, but we only had a few little things in the house.
We gave them some bananas and oranges.''
   Police, who have no suspects in the prank, said about 40 slick
posters appeared on telephone poles, mailboxes and store windows
along Telegraph Avenue and at People's Park, where many of the
city's homeless congregate.
   Hancock's husband, state Assemblyman Tom Bates, tore down about
40 fliers early Saturday.
   ``Most of the people who came felt angry, abused and humiliated,
and that angered me,'' said Hancock, who last month assembled
mayors from throughout the San Francisco Bay area to help
coordinate homeless services.

<HEAD>Artist Paints Tiny Portraits on Baseballs, Rice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dave Stevens has an acute eye for art.
   He also has great acuity of vision _ 20-17 to be exact _ which
enables him to paint tiny portraits on grains of rice, watch faces
and the heads of pins.
   His miniature portrait of St. Louis Cardinal shortstop Ozzie
Smith on a grain of rice is enshrined in the St. Louis Baseball
Hall of Fame.
   Now his attention has turned to bigger things: portraits of
Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog on baseballs.
   ``Herzog has a banquet coming up at the end of May. I have to do
seven dozen portraits in seven weeks,'' he said, dipping a tiny
brush into a palette.
   The Alton artist painted 100 baseballs with Herzog's likeness
for the manager last year. Herzog auctioned them off to benefit the
YMCA.
   A baseball card serves as Stevens' inspiration and he creates
his art on a TV tray in his living room. It takes Stevens about one
hour to paint Herzog's portrait on the back of a regulation
baseball.
   ``I do it over and over so they're not identical, but I want
them as close as possible,'' he says.
   Stevens collects $25 per portrait, not including the cost of the
ball.
   He doesn't limit his subjects to baseball players or baseballs.
His favorite effort: a grinning Mickey Mouse on the head of a
straight pin.
   ``I've done portraits on old lockets and inside pocket watch
covers,'' he said. ``Once I took the crystal out and painted a
player in the batting stance on the face of a watch. I made the bat
on the big hand and the ball with all the stitchings on the end of
the small hand,'' he said.
   Steven's smallest painting is a skull and crossbones on the tip
of a paper clip for a motorcycle rider.
   ``I read the smallest painting in the world is on the head of a
pin, so I used the paper clip. The wire tip is as small as a shaft
of the pin,'' the artist said.
   Most of his ideas come from customers who want, for example, a
portrait of an anniversary couple on rice or a color drawing of a
favorite car encased on a belt buckle, Stevens said.
   Stevens began creating miniature art six years ago out of
boredom.
   ``It was one of those weekends in August when nothing was on TV
and I had been asleep on the couch,'' he said. ``I painted a scene
on a stone the size of a quarter and it snowballed after that.''

<HEAD>China Criticizes Taiwan Over Democracy Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China on Sunday accused Taiwan of trying to
foment unrest on the mainland by promising to help pro-democracy
activists who intend to broadcast messages from a ship off the
Chinese coast.
   The 1,200-ton vessel, backed by the Paris-based Chinese
dissident group The Federation for a Democratic China, set sail
from France on March 17. Its crew plans to begin broadcasting
music, news and pro-democracy reports to the mainland in early May.
   Taiwan Communications Minister Chang Chieh-pan said on April 20
that the ship would be allowed to dock at Keelung, north of the
capital of Taipei, and that the military would protect the ship if
it came under attack while in Taiwan waters. The ship, dubbed the
``Goddess of Democracy,'' is expected to arrive in the next few
days.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency said Sunday that Taiwan's
support of the ship is ``a new step to oppose the Chinese
government and to create disturbances on the Chinese mainland.''
   China's Foreign Ministry has stated China ``cannot tolerate''
support for the radio ship. The government has not ruled out the
use of force to stop the broadcasts.
   ``Taiwan authorities meddled in many ways in last year's
anti-government rebellion in Beijing,'' Xinhua said Sunday,
referring to the pro-democracy movement crushed by military force
in June.
   Now, it said, ``Taiwan authorities are intensifying their
efforts by organizing those fugitives to conduct subversive
propaganda along the coast of the Chinese mainland. This
constitutes an open provocation.''
   It said Taiwan's leaders ``talk glibly about wanting to ease
relations between both sides of the Taiwan Strait, but do just the
opposite.''
   The agency also said the International Telecommunications Union,
in response to a complaint from China, had confirmed that
unauthorized broadcasting from a ship on the high seas is illegal.
   Taiwan and China have been bitter enemies since Nationalists
lost a civil war to the Communists, who took over the mainland in
1949.
   However, trade and other unofficial contacts between the two
nations have grown steadily over the past few years, and hundreds
of thousands of Taiwan residents visited the mainland since their
government lifted a ban on such visits in 1987.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet army newspaper disclosed for the first
time Sunday that when the Russians downed a U.S. spy plane 30 years
ago they also destroyed one of their own fighters that was pursuing
the American U-2.
   The U-2, piloted by Francis Gary Powers, was shot down on May 1,
1960, disrupting a summit meeting 19 days later in Paris between
President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita S.
Khrushchev and forcing the cancellation of another summit planned
for later that year.
   Red Star, the Soviet army newspaper, said the Soviets lost a
MiG-19 and its pilot in the operation.
   The paper also disclosed for the first time that the Soviets
sent up a new fighter plane and ordered its pilot to ram the U-2 in
a suicide mission. The new fighter reached the U-2's altitude but
failed to ram it.
   The article, published three days before this year's May Day
festivities, may have been intended to remind Soviet readers that
U.S. actions have damaged superpower ties in the past. In recent
days, Soviet officials have warned relations might suffer if
Washington imposes sanctions on Moscow in retaliation for its
crackdown on the Baltic republic of Lithuania.
   Red Star said that Khrushchev was atop Lenin's Mausoleum on Red
Square watching the May Day parade when he learned that a new model
Soviet SA-2 surface-to-air missile had brought down the U-2.
   The commander of the Soviet air defense forces, Marshal Sergei
Biryuzov, climbed the mausoleum ``carrying happy news, that the
plane had been hit by the first rocket,'' the article said. ``And
Khrushchev, standing right there on the tribune, congratulated the
marshal.''
   Khrushchev, in memoirs smuggled to the West and published in
1974, wrote that diplomats watching the parade knew something big
had happened because Biryuzov wore a duty uniform rather than the
parade dress worn by the other military officers in Red Square.
   Soviets hurrying to the May Day parade in the Ural Mountain city
of Sverdlovsk saw a far different sight, what appeared to be
fireworks high in the air, said the article, signed by a Col. A.
Dokuchayev.
   The fiery debris was not fireworks, but a Soviet MiG-19 that was
hit by the same type of missile that exploded behind Power's U-2
and damaged it, Red Star said in the most detailed version of the
Soviet military action.
   Powers' mission began in Pakistan and was to have carried him
over Sverdlovsk for a landing in Norway.
   He used neither the automatic destruction device nor a poison
pin he had been given in case the mission failed, and he was
captured at a collective farm near Sverdlovsk. He was held for
three years, then exchanged for the Soviet spy Rudolph Abel. Powers
published his memoirs in 1970.
   The Soviet article disclosed for the first time that the Soviets
had ordered a new model Sukhoi-9 fighter to pursue the U-2 in an
unsuccessful ramming attempt. The Su-9 was unarmed, but was able
reach nearly to the 70,000 feet at which the U-2 operated, the
report said.
   The Soviets also scrambled two MiG-19's, which were not capable
of flying that high. The pilot of one MiG-19, Boris Ivazyan,
reported to ground control that the debris from the U-2 was
actually that from an SA-2 that had missed the U-2, prompting the
ground battery to fire another.
   The next Soviet missile struck the MiG-19 flown by Sergei
Safronov, 30, who was killed. He was one of 21 Soviets given medals
for their role in bringing down Powers, and the Red Star article
disclosed for the first time that he was honored posthumously.
   Ivazyan survived and later married Safronov's widow.
   U.S. accounts say that the decision to send Powers was
controversial within the Eisenhower administration. The Soviets had
failed to shoot down a U-2 over the same area April 9, and some
within the administration feared sending another mission could
jeopardize U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The U-2 incident ended a thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations and was
followed by some of the worst moments of the Cold War: the Bay of
Pigs landing of U.S.-backed forces in Cuba in January 1961, the
construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, and the Cuban missile
crisis in October 1962.
   American author James Oberg, in his book, ``Uncovering Soviet
Disasters,'' wrote that two unanswered questions of the U-2
incident were why a U.S. spy plane penetrated so deeply into
Russia, and why the Soviets had based their latest anti-aircraft
missile 1,000 miles within their own borders, protecting Sverdlovsk.
   The Soviet article shed no light on those mysteries. It said
only that the U-2 carried photographic equipment intended for use
over Sverdlovsk, which is closed to Westerners because it houses
major defense industries.
   Military goods produced in the Sverdlovsk region, according to
material available in the West, include heavy machinery, chemical
weapons and nuclear weapons components.

<HEAD>Oops, Soprano Finds Finale Is A Bit Too Real</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD BLUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Wagner's 19{-hour ``The Ring of the
Nibelungen'' is supposed to conclude with mass destruction by flood
and fire _ but not with the hall of the Gibichungs collapsing on
the soprano's head.
   That's what happened Saturday night at the Metropolitan Opera in
the final scene of ``Gotterdammerung,'' the final opera of the epic
tetralogy.
   Hildegard Behrens, the West German soprano singing the role of
Bruennhilde, was struck by a collapsing foam rubber-and-canvas beam
and knocked to the ground. As a result, she wound up in a New York
hospital instead of on Siegfried's funeral pyre.
   ``It collapsed earlier than it should have,'' said Metropolitan
Opera spokesman Peter Clark.
   Miss Behrens, in her mid-40s, walked off the set under her own
power, Clark said. She had a grazed forehead and scrapes on her
elbows, and was taken out of the opera house on a stretcher after
being examined by the house doctor, Clark said. She was treated at
Roosevelt Hospital and released.
   Clark said Miss Behrens is still scheduled to perform Tuesday in
``Die Walkure.'' The Ring Cycle is being performed three times this
spring by the Metropolitan Opera and is being videotaped by the
Public Broadcasting Service.
   It will be shown nationally June 18-21. The version shown will
be a composite from all three cycles and from performances of ``Die
Walkure'' taped last spring.
   After the conclusion of the performance, Stephen Brown, a stage
manager, announced that Miss Behrens had been injured and there
would be no curtain calls.
   The cycle, performed over four nights, usually concludes with
thunderous ovations for Bruennhilde, who ends the cycle with the
Immolation scene in which she redeems the world through love by
returning the magic ring to the Rhine.
   The Ring Cycle is about an ancient world of men, dwarfs, giants,
gods and rhinemaidens. Gold is stolen from the Rhine at the start
and forged into a magic ring, whose owner can rule the world. But
the ring is cursed and in ``Gotterdammerung,'' Valhalla is
destroyed.

   Ersin Kokkozov had never heard of drawing
interest in a private bank, but the Soviet scientist was so
thrilled with the concept he opened his own account.
   Crescent Bank officials didn't know if Kokkozov fulfilled his
wish to be the first Soviet citizen to open a U.S. bank account _
but he certainly was the first in this small north Georgia town.
   ``I've got $10, so I'll be the first,'' Kokkozov said during a
tour of the bank with participants in an exchange program with the
Soviets. ``I'll just be like a symbol _ my money is here in trust.''
   It took an interpreter's help and some effort to make the bank
computer accept an address in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan. But Kokkozov
soon had a checkbook and a set of complimentary coffee mugs.
   Kokkozov, the general manager of a Soviet research firm, said he
can't wait until his next trip to the United States to see how much
interest he's earned.
   ``How long do you have to leave it here?'' the budding
capitalist asked.
   In the Soviet Union, only government banks exist, and people
don't deal in checks and credit cards. Workers are paid in cash.
   So when bank tellers demonstrated the automatic teller machine,
the Soviets gasped in amazement.
   ``Only in America,'' exclaimed Leila Namuradze.
   Another visitor, Valeri Kadzanaya, drew out his business card
and asked if it too could make transactions.
   The 15 Soviets were part of almost 300 people, mostly Soviet
Georgians, participating in the U.S.-Soviet exchange. About 260
U.S. Georgians are now traveling in the Soviet Georgian capital of
Tbilisi.

<HEAD>Tractor-Trailer Catches Fire with Marijuana Cargo Inside</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARSHALL, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a tractor-trailer rig hauling
marijuana caught fire, the driver and a passenger unhitched the
blazing trailer at the side of the road, drove into town, changed
clothes and disappeared, investigators said.
   The driver and a passenger did take time to cut locks on the
trailer and apparently tried to put out the fire Saturday along
Interstate 20.
   But when they were unsuccessful, they abandoned the rig, drove
the tractor into downtown Marshall and parked it one block from the
Harrison County Sheriff's Department, deputies said.
   Witnesses said two men got out of the truck, changed clothes and
walked away in different directions, leaving the 1989 Kenworth,
worth an estimated $100,000. The suspects were still at large
Sunday.
   Investigators found a burned truck log book in a nearby trash
barrel.
   About 1,850 pounds of marijuana was salvaged from the fire.
Narcotics investigators said the truck could have been hauling well
over one ton of marijuana with a street value of more than $2
million.
   The marijuana was wrapped in cellophane and packed in round
cardboard moving containers, each of which was padlocked, they said.
   ``It was a big-time operation,'' said Sheriff Bill Oldham.
   Narcotics investigators said papers found inside the truck
indicated the cargo was picked up Friday at Tucson, Ariz., and was
destined for Atlanta.

<HEAD>Shamir Pledges More Jewish Settlements, Attacks Baker Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir pledged on Sunday
to continue Israel's settlement drive in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip despite U.S. objections.
   Shamir also said progress towards peace negotiations do not
depend on agreeing to U.S. terms for Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
   In a nationally broadcast interview on Israel's 42nd anniversary
of independence, Shamir said he wished the Jewish settlement effort
could be more extensive.
   ``You cannot speak today of a massive settlement drive. I wish
we could ... to my sorrow, in view of the task facing us we would
not be able to deal in the next year or two with a massive
settlement drive,'' Shamir said.
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, referred to the vast
influx of Soviet emigres, one of Israel's most pressing problems.
   ``But some development, some progress, always has to take place.
We must not stand in one place. I think this government would not
accept any obligation not to do something in this area of
settlement and development,'' he said.
   Shamir said he cannot ignore the objections of the U.S.
administration, which views settlements in the occupied lands as an
obstacle to peace.
   Israel-U.S. relations have been strained by Shamir's refusal to
accept U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III's proposals for
peace talks and by recent settlement activity in east Jerusalem,
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel seized those areas during the 1967 Middle East War and
has been trying to quell a 28-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
territories.
   ``I have to say that there is something perhaps ridiculous in
the slogan of `yes to Baker,''' Shamir said in an Israel Radio
interview.
   ``But if there's understanding and cooperation with the United
States, well then no one can expect us to accept every proposal and
every idea of the American secretary, be what they may be,'' he
said.
   Israel's governing Likud-Labor coalition fell apart March 15
after Shamir refused to endorse the Baker proposals supported by
Shimon Peres, leader or the center-left Labor party. Shamir is
caretaker prime minister and is trying to form a new government.
   The Baker program provides a framework for starting a dialogue
on Israel's proposal to hold elections to choose representatives to
negotiate an interim autonomy plan for 1.7 million Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   About 75,000 Jewish settlers live in the occupied territories.
   The leftist daily Al Hamishmar reported that a Shamir settlement
aide, Michael Dekel, is preparing plans for the speedy construction
of two other settlements in the West Bank. It said the settlements
have yet to be approved by the government.
   Since Shamir became head of the caretaker government, Jewish
settlers began construction at Dugit in the Gaza Strip and at Alon
in the West Bank.
   In addition, about 150 settlers also took over a building owned
by the Greek Orthodox Church in the Christian Quarter of
Jerusalem's old walled city, but a court ordered them to leave.

   A group calling itself the Organization
of Islamic Dawn announced Sunday it will free American hostage
Frank Reed within 48 hours and said he will carry a message for the
U.S. government.
   In Iran, a newspaper quoted an Iranian official as also saying
Reed's release was expected by Tuesday night after ``extensive
talks'' between the kidnappers and Iran.
   The announcement from the previously unknown Islamic Dawn group
was delivered to the independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar three
hours after an earlier unsigned communique said the U.S. educator _
held for more than 3{ years _ will be freed by Tuesday.
   The later statement was accompanied by a black-and-white picture
of a bearded, smiling Reed to prove its authenticity. It claimed
responsibility for the earlier statement, sent with two other
pictures to the independent newspaper and a Western news agency.
   The communiques were released one week after a pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem group freed American hostage Robert Polhill. Polhill,
the first American hostage to have been freed since November 1986,
was released with the help of Syria.
   Reed, 57, of Malden, Mass., is married to a Syrian Moslem woman.
   Both statements were typewritten in Arabic. The later one
contained a denial of news reports that the first communique
promising Reed's release was signed by the Organization of Arab
Revolutionary Cells-Omar Moukhtar Brigade, a shadowy group that had
initially claimed Reed's abduction on Sept. 9, 1986.
   The statements, which did not say what the message to Washington
would contain, left President Bush and Reed's relatives hopeful but
cautious.
   ``I just won't say anything,'' Bush said while golfing at
Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington. ``If that proves to be
true, that's wonderful.''
   Leota Sprague, Reed's 91-year-old mother, said she has ``to keep
faith.''
   ``It's an awful thrust in your side when you find out these
things aren't true,'' she said from her home in Malden, Mass.
   Bob Langston, Reed's son-in-law, said from his Malden home:
``We're feeling cautious. It would be wonderful if this really
happened. But there have been so many false alarms with the other
hostages.''
   In Iran, the Tehran Times quoted the unidentified Iranian
official as saying ``extensive talks'' were going on between the
kidnappers and Iran and a release was expected by Tuesday night.
   The English-language newspaper, considered close to Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, said in its Monday edition that Iran
asked the kidnappers to free another captive.
   The statements in Beirut were accompanied by the first two
photographs of Reed to be released since he was kidnapped and
contained the first news of Reed since his abduction.
   The first communique was delivered around 6:30 p.m. (12:30 p.m.
EDT), meaning that Reed would presumably be released by that time
on Tuesday.
   The statement said:
   ``In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate,
   ``We have decided to free American hostage Frank Reed within 48
hours. He will carry a message addressed to the American
administration.''
   An-Nahar also received a color photograph of Reed in which he
appeared neatly combed and clean shaven and wore a blue-and-white
striped shirt.
   The Western news agency received a black-and-white photo of
Reed, showing him with a bushy grey beard. He wore a dark T-shirt
and looked straight into the camera with slightly hunched
shoulders. People who knew Reed said he never wore a beard while
living in Beirut before the kidnapping, indicating the
black-and-white photo was probably taken of him in captivity.
   The later communique repeated the first message, claimed
responsibility for the kidnapping and warned news media not to say
he was being held by others.
   The name given for the group, the Islamic Dawn, suggests the
kidnappers are pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem zealots like those holding
most of the 17 Westerners missing in Lebanon.
   Reed, director of the Lebanese International School, was
kidnapped near Beirut airport. Gunmen in a dark blue Volvo
intercepted his car and seized him and the driver, who later was
released.
   A previously unknown group, calling itself the Arab
Revolutionary Cells -Omar Mukhtar Brigade, claimed responsibility
for Reed's abduction in a statement released to Beirut newspapers
five days after his abduction.
   There was no authentication of that statement, and kidnappers
released no word on him until Sunday.
   Reed is one of 17 Western hostages, including seven Americans,
held in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   Earlier Sunday, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was ``very optimistic that
we're going to see more hostages released.''
   Interviewed on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' show in Washington,
Boren said the reasons for that optimism include economic problems
in Iran and Syria, including a reduction in Soviet aid to Damascus.
   Reed had lived in Beirut since late 1977. He had converted to
Islam to marry his second wife, Fahima, a Syrian Moslem. He has two
children, Jacqueline and Marilyn, from his first marriage.
   Former French hostage Jean-Paul Kauffmann said after his release
on May 4, 1988, that he had seen Reed among hostages held by the
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem Islamic Jihad, or Islamic holy war.
   Islamic Jihad holds Anderson, 42, of Lorain, Ohio, and Thomas
Sutherland, 58, of Fort Collins, Colo.
   Sutherland, who was acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   The pro-Iranian group Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine freed Polhill, 55, of New York on April 22 after nearly
39 months in captivity. It called the move a goodwill gesture.

<HEAD>`Malta Fever' Widespread in Iraq, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An outbreak of Malta fever, a serious
bacterial disease, is threatening this Middle Eastern country's
livestock population and has already killed many people, a
government newspaper reported Sunday.
   The disease, also known as brucellosis, is transmitted to humans
by domestic animals or their food products. Humans can be infected
by drinking unpasteurized dairy products or poorly cooked meat.
   The English-language Baghdad Observer reported that an
international conference on Malta fever ended recently with a call
to eradicate the disease.
   It quoted an unidentified source at the conference as saying the
disease has reached epidemic proportions in some areas of Iraq.
   An outbreak of the disease last summer killed many people in the
north and forced the government to ban the sale of milk products in
many parts of the country.
   Authorities have not issued any figures on how many people were
stricken by the disease or how many died.
   But the newspaper said a recent survey in villages near the
northern city of Mosul showed that 10 percent of the population
carried the virus.
   Malta fever, first identified in 1887 on the Mediterranean
island, has been reported on the increase in recent years
throughout the world.
   The disease is characterized by recurrent fever and pains in the
joints.
   It can be treated with strong antibiotics, but medical experts
believe the best means of combatting the disease is to eradicate it
in animals.

<HEAD>Finnish Communists Dissolve Party, Form Left-Wing Coalition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finnish communists have voted to
disband the country's 72-year-old Communist Party and form a new
left-wing coalition in an effort to revive the declining socialist
movement, officials said Sunday.
   The move comes after a decade in which political support for
far-left parties has steadily declined. They now hold only 20 seats
in the 200-member parliament, compared with 35 in 1979.
   At a two-day meeting that ended Sunday, more than 4,000
communist and other left-wing delegates voted to dissolve the
Communist Party as well as its umbrella organization, the People's
Democratic League, and the breakaway Democratic Alternative faction.
   In their place, the delegates formed a new organization known as
the Left-Wing Union.
   Claes Andersson, a left-wing member of Parliament who was
elected chairman of the Left-Wing Union, predicted that the
traditional rivalries that have traditionally split the Finnish
communist movement would disappear.
   ``The meeting was a very successful one. There was a good
feeling and none of the old conflicts,'' Andersson said in a radio
interview at the end of the meeting.
   The Finnish Communist Party, founded in Moscow in 1918, was
forced to operate underground in Finland until the end of World War
II, when Finland signed a cooperation agreement with the Soviet
Union.
   In the 1960s, the communist movement suffered a deep split
between a moderate majority faction and a hard-line minority.
   The split gave birth to other breakaway movements and caused the
communists to lose influence on national politics.
   Neutral Finland is now governed by a coalition of the
Conservatives, Social Democrats and two small non-socialist parties.

   Music replaced mourning sirens Sunday night as
Israelis ended memorial ceremonies honoring war dead and began
celebrating the 42nd anniversary of the Jewish state's independence.
   ``Joy and sorrow are intertwined in our national holiday just as
the balance of light and shadow in the life of our nation,''
President Chaim Herzog said in an address to the nation.
   Throughout the country Israelis took to the streets dancing to
rock and disco music. Children engaged in a favorite Independence
Day pastime _ hitting passers-by with small plastic hammers that
produce a clicking noise.
   Police estimated nearly 1 million Israelis _ nearly one-fourth
of the country's population _ would go on picnics and hikes on
Monday when the sundown-to-sundown holiday continues. Independence
Day festivities, however, were held mainly on Sunday night.
   In an Independence Day message released by his office, Herzog
said the main challenge facing Israel in the coming year was
absorbing 100,000 Soviet immigrants expected to arrive this year.
   ``This is the most important challenge on the list of national
priorities,'' he said. ``Jewish history will not forgive us if we
fail to see the greatness of the hour.''
   Arab states have lobbied the Soviet Union to halt the
immigration, fearing it will strengthen the Jewish state and that
some of the immigrants may be settled in the occupied West Bank or
Gaza Strip.
   Before Independence Day began, Israelis lit memorial flames and
visited gravesites at military cemeteries across the country as
part of Memorial Day.
   In somber wreath-laying ceremonies at army cemeteries, mourners
lit flames and recited the Kaddish, a prayer for the dead,
remembering the 16,951 soldiers killed in Israel's five wars with
Arab nations and in Arab guerrilla attacks.
   At Jerusalem's Mount Herzl military cemetery, bereaved parents,
widows and orphans of fallen soldiers clung to tombstones while
others wept silently.
   Earlier in the day a two-minute mourning siren brought buses and
automobiles as well as hundreds of pedestrians to an abrupt halt.
Israelis stood at attention in silent tribute.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, in a 10-minute nationally
broadcast speech, honored the fallen, including eight soldiers
killed during the 28-month Palestinian rebellion in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   ``Our enemies sanctify and praise death in their struggle
against us, but we have always and will forever praise life even
though our warriors and sons are ready to sacrifice their lives,''
Shamir said.
   In a broadcast interview, Shamir pledged to continue Israel's
settlement drive in the occupied territories despite U.S.
objections. He also said progress toward peace negotiations do not
depend on agreeing to U.S. terms for Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
   Israel's governing coalition fell apart March 15 after Shamir
refused to endorse U.S. peace proposals. Since then, Shamir has
been caretaker prime minister.
   The army on Sunday strengthened forces in the occupied West Bank
and kept the 750,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip under curfew to
prevent anti-Israeli attacks.
   But the security measures failed to stop masked Arab assailants
from shooting and fatally stabbing a West Bank Palestinian
suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities, hospital and
Arab reports said.
   The reports identified the slain man as Zuhair Ijil, 44, of the
West Bank town of El-Bireh.
   His death brought to 210 the number of Palestinians slain by
fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli
authorities. At least 680 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
troops and civilians in the rebellion, and 43 Israelis have also
died in the violence.
   Israel declared independence on May 14, 1948, the day the
British mandate terminated in Palestine. The next day, armies of
five Arab countries attacked Israel. Independence Day is celebrated
in accordance with the Jewish lunar calendar.

<HEAD>More Than 100 Arrested After Two Nights of Disturbances in College
Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Revelers hurled rocks and bottles
and police responded with tear gas during two nights of
disturbances at a university festival, police said Sunday. At least
20 people were injured and 110 arrested.
   The confrontations between partyers and police on Friday and
Saturday nights occurred during the 58th annual ``Poly Royal''
celebration at California Polytechnic State University.
   ``The cops started blaring on the P.A. system: `Assault on
police officers will not look good on your resume!''' said freshman
Heath Patton.
   A statement issued jointly by the university and city said an
evaluation of the future of Poly Royal will begin this week.
   The worst of the disturbances happened Friday night, when
windows at a liquor store were smashed and terrified employees
threw full champagne bottles at a crowd that shouted ``Free beer!
Free beer!'' while trying to get in. The crowd threw back empty
beer bottles.
   Numerous homes and vehicles were damaged during the two nights
of violence, authorities reported. Police said they made 30 arrests
Friday, and 80 on Saturday.
   Twelve police officers were injured on Friday, one of them
suffering a broken arm, and at least other six people required
medical treatment, authorities said.
   At 10:30 p.m. on Saturday, about 125 officers moved in to break
up a crowd, which threw bottles and rocks. Police fought back with
fire hoses and tear gas. Most of the crowd was dispersed by 1:30
a.m. Sunday, said police Sgt. Daniel Blankey. Blankey said.
   He said ``arrests were made for offenses ranging from failure to
disperse to assault with a deadly weapon.''
   Two officers were hurt, and numerous others received minor
injuries. One person was hospitalized for a head injury.
   The two-day Poly Royal open house usually attracts about 100,000
people to the 17,000-student campus next to the central coast city
of 40,000, said university spokesman Don McCaleb.
   Last week the San Luis Obispo-Atascadero area was named the best
small community in the United States to call home by ``The Rating
Guide to Life in America's Small Cities.'' The guide cited the
areas mild climate and ``easygoing charm.''
   The Poly Royal was established as a showcase of student
accomplishments, but parties and entertainment have become part of
it.
   Disturbances have occurred in the last few years, but none as
large at those this weekend.
   The trouble began Friday night when police and paramedics
responded to a car accident near the campus and found a large
crowd. The revelers began tossing rocks and bottles.
   Thirty police officers were trying to calm the crowd, which grew
to about 500 college-age people, when they were called away to
another disturbance.
   At least 25 people were reported fighting on Foothill Boulevard,
and arriving officers were met with a barrage of bricks, rocks,
tiles, bottles, street signs and other objects from a crowd
estimated at 800 to 1,000 people, Blankey said.
   Student leader Ricardo Echeverria, president of Associated
Students of Cal Poly, issued a statement saying students want to
prevent the kind of trouble that developed Friday night.
   ``However, with so many out-of-town visitors we are faced with
many uncontrollable factors,'' Echeverria said.

<HEAD>Electricity Production at Seabrook Delayed Again </HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seabrook nuclear power plant won't
produce electricity until late May at the earliest, its operator
said Sunday.
   The reactor was shut down Saturday night for up to six weeks to
modify a turbine on the plant's non-nuclear side, said Ron Sher, a
spokesman for New Hampshire Yankee.
   It's the third shutdown since the plant began tests March 20 to
crank up to full power.
   The utility had wanted to begin producing nuclear-powered
electricity this week. But tests showed that electrical feedback
from the New England power network could cause a 200-foot shaft in
the turbine to vibrate beyond specifications.
   Roy Morrison, of the anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance, called the
$6.4 billion plant ``a piece of junk'' and said the shutdown is
another example of why Seabrook shouldn't be allowed to operate.
   David Scanzoni, another utility spokesman, said the reactor was
shut down March 22 for adjustments and a week later because of
questionable readings from sensors on the turbine.
   ``We'll take all the time that's necessary, we're not schedule
driven,'' he said.
   Seabrook got its Nuclear Regulatory Commission operating license
March 15.
   In neighboring Vermont, 34 anti-nuclear activists faced
trespassing charges following weekend demonstrations at the Vermont
Yankee nuclear power plant to mark the fourth anniversary of the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
   More than 150 protesters marched to the plant in Vernon on
Saturday. Police said some got onto the grounds by rafting down the
Connecticut River and scaling a fence.
   The protesters, who included members of the Green Mountain, the
Clamshell and the New England Green alliances, had said they would
blockade the plant and shut it down. But Vermont Yankee spokeswoman
Mary Schneider said it continued normal operation.
   Official figures say the explosion and fire at the Chernobyl
reactor on April 26, 1986, killed 31 people. Unofficial reports
said at least 250 died. The blast sent a cloud of radioactive gas
around the world.

<DATELINE>APPENZELL, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Switzerland's final bastion of
male supremacy on Sunday defiantly refused to give women the vote
in local affairs.
   The all-male sword-carrying legislative assembly of
Appenzell-Rhodes Interior, a northeastern canton, overwhelmingly
rejected a federally-proposed constitutional amendment on local
suffrage for women.
   ``It does not mean that we think that women are worth less,''
said one man who addressed the gathering. ``But it would not make
women happier. If they were happier in the countries where they
have the vote, I would immediately say yes.''
   The vote by a show of hands came two decades after Swiss women
won the vote on federal matters and 10 years after the federal
constitution was revised to formally proclaim equal rights for both
sexes.
   Swiss President and Justice Minister Arnold Koller, a citizen of
the canton, was a guest of honor at the assembly, which was
broadcast live on Swiss television. The 4,000 male legislators and
residents at the assembly wore traditional swords to demonstrate
their voting eligibility.
   Beat Graf, the newly elected head of the canton's government had
urged support of the proposed change but was the only speaker to do
so.
   ``Lifestyles have changed here, too,'' Graf said. ``We cannot
forever refuse to join the development in the other cantons.''
   The Cabinet of the neighboring principality of Liechtenstein
also attended Sunday's ceremony, along with the ambassadors of
Sweden and Spain. Thousands of tourists lined the assembly square
and the streets of the picturesque small town. A solemn, colorful
procession preceded the meeting.
   Appenzell-Rhodes Interior is Switzerland's smallest state and
one of its poorest. The mountainous, rural state has a population
of 13,000 and is predominantly Roman Catholic. The state has twice
rejected women's suffrage, once in 1973 and again in 1982.
   The surprise decision was expected to leave the final say on the
issue to Switzerland's supreme court, the Federal Tribunal. Pending
the assembly, the court had put off a ruling on a constitutional
complaint filed by a woman resident of the canton. She had invoked
the federal constitution's equal rights article.
   Appenzell Inner-Rhodes is the only one of Switzerland's 26
sovereign states, or cantons, that still denies women the vote on
local issues ranging from budget questions to alcohol laws.
   In a close vote neighboring Appenzell Outer-Rhodes granted the
vote to women last year. A 1986-87 survey of women in that state of
50,000 showed that only 57 percent favored having the right to vote.

   Discovery glided safely
back to Earth on Sunday, landing with new brakes after launching
the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope to search for clues to the
universe's creation.
   NASA engineers in Maryland, meanwhile, tried to figure out how
to restore full movement to one of the telescope's two dish-shaped,
high-speed antennas.
   They believe the antenna was caught behind a cable that bent
outward from its proper position before Discovery was launched,
spokesman Mike Harrington said.
   The shuttle touched down on a 15,000-foot concrete runway at
this Mojave Desert military base at 6:49 a.m. after a slackening of
40 mph winds that threatened to delay the landing.
   The spacecraft rolled to a stop 63 seconds later.
   ``Welcome back. Congratulations on a super mission,'' ground
communicator Steve Oswald told the shuttle's crew. ``The world is
waiting to reap the benefits of your work over the next 15 years.''
   ``We sure enjoyed it also. It was great fun,'' replied Loren J.
Shriver, Discovery's commander.
   About 20,000 people cheered Discovery's return as the national
anthem blared through loudspeakers.
   The astronauts emerged from the shuttle about 50 minutes after
landing. Shriver was accompanied by pilot Charles F. Bolden Jr. and
mission specialists Steven A. Hawley, Bruce McCandless II and
Kathryn D. Sullivan.
   A cheering crowd of several hundred people gave the astronauts a
rousing sendoff before they boarded two jets to take them back to
Houston four hours after the landing.
   ``The Hubble space telescope is going to be a facility second to
none,'' Hawley told the crowd. ``Over the next 10, 15, and 20 years
it will revolutionize the way we look at our universe and the way
we understand where we came from and where we're going.''
   Seven hours after touchdown, the astronauts returned home to
Houston where they were greeted at Ellington Field by about 300
well-wishers. They will have Monday off before reporting back to
work for a week of briefings.
   Engineers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Md., continued the months-long process of checking out the
43-foot-long telescope and its sophisticated instruments.
   The high-gain antenna should move from side to side 180 degrees
and from front to overhead to back 180 degrees.
   But when controllers moved it in recent days, it apparently got
caught behind a ``pretty hefty'' power cable that warped out from
its normal position against the 15-foot-long arm supporting the
antenna, Harrington said.
   He said the engineers probably would attempt to back the antenna
out of the trap sometime this week, allowing 180-degree motion on
one axis and 150-degree motion on the other.
   Recent inspection of photos taken just before Discovery's
payload bay doors were closed for launch revealed the cable had
bowed outward, said Harrington.
   ``Our hope is that we'll be fully operational within a week,''
deputy project manager Jean Olivier. ``The first pictures, I still
feel, are approximately a week away.''
   To learn more about the antenna problem, the engineers got the
telescope to transmit recorded data over a secondary, low-gain
antenna. Failure to fix the problem completely would somewhat limit
the information the telescope can send back to Earth, Olivier said.
   To place the telescope in the proper orbit on Wednesday,
Discovery flew to an altitude of 380 miles, higher than any
previous shuttle.
   The returning shuttle crossed the California coast near Santa
Barbara, announcing its arrival with the characteristic twin sonic
booms.
   Discovery was the first shuttle to land with new carbon brakes
similar to those on passenger jetliners. Installation and testing
of new brakes on all the shuttles are steps toward the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's plans to eventually land the
craft at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
   The carbon brakes can withstand longer stopping distances and
higher temperatures than the older beryllium brakes. They're
expected to last for 50 landings; the older brakes are designed for
six.
   William Lenoir, NASA's associate administrator for space flight,
said the brakes worked very well. ``Loren Shriver said they felt
good, firm and comfortable,'' he said.
   Using the shuttle's robot arm, Hawley deployed the Hubble Space
Telescope on Wednesday, one day after the shuttle was launched from
Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   From its orbit above the distorting effects of Earth's
atmosphere, the telescope is capable of detecting objects 50 times
fainter and with 10 times more detail than the best ground-based
observatory. It has a 15-year mission, but NASA expects it will
last years longer.
   Astronomers believe the Hubble will be able to look at objects
14 billion light years away.
   The 12{-ton telescope is expected to help scientists better
estimate the size and age of the universe, which they believe was
created about 15 billion years ago.
   When controllers moved the telescope's high-speed antenna, and
again when the lens cover was opened Friday for the first time, the
actions moved the telescope too much and an automatic system shut
down the Hubble's electronics. It took more than a day to restore
them.
   Discovery is scheduled to leave Friday for its piggyback jet
ride back to Cape Canaveral.
   The next shuttle launch is scheduled for May 16, when Columbia
and seven astronauts will carry a $100 million observatory named
Astro into orbit.

   Rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and
militiamen of the right-wing Lebanese Forces militia skirmished in
east Beirut Sunday, but a 33-hour cease-fire between the Christian
rivals held in the mountains.
   There were no reports of casualties Sunday in the
three-month-old power struggle for mastery of the Christian enclave
north of Beirut.
   At least 919 people have been killed and 2,442 wounded since
fighting erupted Jan. 30 when Aoun moved against the militia led by
Samir Geagea.
   The cease-fire in the Kesrouan mountains on the eastern edge of
the 310-square-mile enclave took effect at 9 a.m. Saturday and was
to end at 6 p.m. Sunday.
   The cease-fire was called primarily to allow residents of the
disputed resorts of Daraya and Kleiat in the Kesrouan mountains to
return to the devastated towns to salvage what they can of their
homes.
   Hundreds of refugees poured into the towns Sunday while the
cease-fire held, police reported. Daraya has been deserted by
nearly all its 12,000 citizens and barely 200 of Kleiat's 20,000
residents remain.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the few remaining civilians still in the two
resorts took advantage of the truce to leave before an expected
resumption of fighting.
   The Conservative ad-Diyar daily, which is based in Christian
east Beirut, described the truce as a farce and added: ``It's like
being invited to prepare the dead for burial.''
   The daily said the truce was declared ``so the residents could
touch with their own hands the stones of their damaged homes ...
and see with their own eyes the black smoke'' billowing from them.
   Kleiat has been severely damaged in the savage fighting between
Aoun's troops and Geagea's militia. The Lebanese Forces hold the
western half of the town while Aoun's men control the northern
edges.
   Both Aoun and Geagea men are Maronites, the main Christian sect
which has dominated politics, the army and the judiciary since
Lebanon's independence from France in 1943.
   Their power struggle has triggered the worst fighting between
Christian rivals since Lebanon's multi-faceted civil war between
Christians and Moslem broke out 15 years ago.
   The fighting has caused damage estimated at $1 billion and
forced 40 percent of the enclave's 1 million residents to flee to
safer areas of Lebanon or abroad.

   A wind-whipped forest fire burned more than
10,000 acres in the isolated mountains of central Pennsylvania on
Sunday before crews brought it under control near the banks of the
Susquehanna River.
   The fire started Saturday morning in the Sproul State Forest and
moved north in warm, dry weather, authorities said.
   The fire burned a swath roughly three miles wide and eight miles
long to within several hundred yards of the Susquehanna's west
branch, where it was brought under control Sunday afternoon, said
Susan Woods, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental
Resources.
   ``It's still burning, but it has been raining so that should
help,'' she said Sunday afternoon.
   The fire stalled about 10 miles west of Renovo.
   ``This is one of the worst single-fire losses we've had since
the 1930s,'' Woods said.
   About 200 firefighters were aided by helicopters dumping water
and flame retardant chemicals, and bulldozers digging 15-foot wide
trenches.
   The fire began near a natural gas pipeline on a forest road, but
Ms. Woods said there were no reports of explosions.
   ``That wasn't determined to be a cause. More than likely the
cause was careless use of fire,'' she said.
   ``A 10,000-acre loss for Pennsylvania is a lot,'' Ms. Woods
said. ``Officials I spoke to couldn't remember a fire as serious as
this.''
   By comparison, fires charred about 16,000 acres of forest in all
of 1986. About 40,000 acres were lost in 1962-63 during a drought,
she said.
   Warm temperatures, low humidity and high winds Saturday had
raised the possibility of accidental fires, she said.
   Four recreational camps in the state forest were destroyed, Ms.
Woods said. Firefighters evacuated campers from the 540,000-acre
state forest, and no injuries were reported. Two people thought to
be hiking through the area were found unharmed by searchers Sunday
morning, she said.
   The area, about 30 miles north of State College, is largely
uninhabited and the fire posed no threat to homes, she said.
   At least three smaller forest fires were reported over the
weekend near Lewisburg, in the Poconos and in Warren County, Ms.
Woods said.

   West German officials closed the cash box on
Sunday and said they would refuse to assume a bigger financial
burden to cushion East Germany's leap into the free market.
   Higher taxes could result if the government of West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl digs any deeper to ease East Germany's
transition from a socialist system, officials said.
   ``Everyone must know that our offer is the maximum of what we
could accept,'' West Germany's finance minister, Theo Waigel, said
in an interview with the West German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said in an interview in Bild
am Sonntag that any more financial concessions would endanger the
West German mark.
   Kohl told manual laborers at a festival in Saarbruecken, West
Germany, he would oppose higher taxes to finance unification.
   Without being specific, he said some of the ideas coming out of
East Germany were unrealistic.
   ``We must also say that the prosperity in West Germany did not
fall from heaven, but came from work,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the administrator of 8,000 East German state-owned
enterprises was quoted as saying West German and foreign investors
will be allowed to buy no more than 50 percent in each company that
is privatized.
   The West German newspaper Die Welt quoted the administrator,
Peter Moreth, as saying the remainder of the companies' will have a
combined value of $178 billion after the economies of the Germanys
are combined.
   Moreth's comments were released on Sunday by Die Welt in advance
of publication on Monday. There was no immediate comment from West
Germany.
   East Germans fear that their current enterprises will be
completely taken over by West German or foreign interests once East
Germany becomes a free market economy.
   Also expressing concerns are East German farmers, who worry that
a flood of West German agricultural products will wreck their
livelihoods.
   Protesting farmers drove hundreds of tractors and trucks on main
roads in protest. About 1,200 farmers formed a 30-mile caravan near
Herzberg, 60 miles south of Berlin, the East German news agency ADN
said.
   Hundreds of farmers also blocked a road leading to nearby
Torgau, where an ``East meets West'' jazz festival was held Sunday.
Soviet and American troops linked up in Torgau on April 25, 1945
after invading Nazi Germany from opposite directions.
   Fears of the economic consequences of unification came a day
before the latest round of talks on merging the disparate
economies. Both Germanys have said their economies and social
institutions will be unified by July 2.
   West Germany last week said it was willing to exchange East
German marks at a 1-1 rate for the powerful West German mark. But
it said personal savings of more than $2,300 would be traded at a
2-1 rate.
   The government of East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere
has said it wants a higher limit on savings accounts to make up for
the loss of housing and food subsidies that were part of the former
socialist system.
   De Maiziere has also said he wants to retain subsidies, at least
initially, on rents, energy and public services.
   The merger of the economies will clear a major hurdle to
unification. A full political union would take place after
all-German elections, which Kohl is pushing to hold next year.
   Much of the debate in West Germany has been influenced by Dec. 2
national elections in that country. Opposition politicians charge
that Kohl already has made too many financial concessions to East
Germany.
   Some West Germans fear that converting the nearly worthless East
German mark at a 1-1 rate and absorbing East Germany's faltering
economy will reduce their buying power, and fuel inflation and tax
increases.
   While the debate continues on the cost of unification, de
Maiziere and other East German officials met with Soviet officials
in Moscow Sunday to discuss a united Germany's strategic future.
   The Soviets want a united Germany to be non-aligned and perhaps
be a joint member of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The United States
and Kohl want a unified Germany to be part of the Western alliance.
   The foreign ministers from the four World War II allies that
divided Germany _ the Soviet Union, United States, Britain and
France _ are to meet in Bonn on Saturday for their first formal
negotiations on German unification.

<TEXT>
   About 1,000 Haitians massed outside an alien
detention center Sunday, tearing down a fence and calling on
immigration officials to release their countrymen.
   A special riot control team of 79 Immigration and Naturalization
Service officers was deployed to hold back the protesters as they
crashed through one gate and advanced on another, said INS District
Director Richard Smith.
   The protesters heeded warnings to stop and no injuries or
arrests were reported at the Krome Service Processing Center 25
miles west of Miami, authorities said.
   ``I warned them in Creole and English if they didn't cease and
desist I'd have to use (tear) gas on them to disperse the crowd,''
Smith said. ``I think this is the closest we've come to a serious
confrontation.''
   The Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, a leader of Miami's Haitian
community, said the protesters were seeking the release of Haitian
detainees, some of whom have spent years in detention while their
asylum cases are processed.
   ``We want freedom and justice for the Haitian refugees and all
the refugees detained,'' he said. ``We must break down the walls of
Krome, which remind us of Hitlerism.''
   About 395 detainees are being kept at Krome, which has a
capacity for some 450 detainees but has been overcrowded in the
past. More recently, there have been allegations that guards
harassed, beat and sexually abused the detainees.
   The allegations are under investigation by immigration officials
and the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General.
   Smith said the compound had gone on full alert Sunday morning in
anticipation of the planned rally. The lockdown meant detainees
were confined to their living quarters throughout the day, and
visits and church services were canceled, he said.
   While there were no problems inside, the protesters outside
tried to force their way in and ``got out of hand,'' Smith said. No
tear gas was fired on the crowd and it began to break up about 4
p.m. after rallying for several hours, he said.
   Jean-Juste said the gates were loose and people just began
pouring inside.
   Smith said he only administers the law, and if the Haitian
protesters want more detainees released, they should take their
concerns to elected officials.
   ``Engaging in violence is certainly not the way to get it
done,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pilot Refuses to Fly Former President, Bodyguards</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two days after the in-flight
assassination of a leftist presidential candidate, a Colombian
airline pilot refused to fly a former president and his bodyguards,
a Bogota newspaper reported Sunday.
   It was the second such incident following Thursday's
assassination of candidate Carlos Pizarro on a domestic Avianca
Airlines flight. A day after the killing, radio reports said about
100 passengers balked at flying with a leftist congresswoman and
her two dozen bodyguards.
   In Saturday's incident, Avianca Capt. Alvaro Sanchez refused to
fly with former president Misael Pastrana aboard, the Bogota daily
El Tiempo reported.
   El Tiempo said it was not known if the decision to refuse seats
to Pastrana and his bodyguards was a decision of the airline or
whether the pilot acted alone. The flight was bound from Bogota to
the Caribbean coastal city of Cartagena.
   Pizarro was hit by 13 bullets from an assassin's submachine gun
while on a flight from Bogota to the Caribbean coastal city of
Barranquilla.
   The plane landed safely, but the pilot, Capt. Fabio Munerva,
said later that people who require bodyguards should not be allowed
on commercial flights.
   The media, citing security sources, have reported that drug
traffickers were the main suspects in Pizarro's killing. But the
Medellin cartel denied involvement and no government official has
yet said who was responsible.
   Traffickers have waged a terrorist campaign since August that
has killed nearly 300 Colombians in an effort to halt the
government's capture and extradition of drug suspects to the United
States.
   Dozens of politicians, government officials and businessmen who
traveled with bodyguards have been killed in Colombia in the last
six years. The victims include a justice minister and an an
attorney general.
   Another presidential candidate, Bernardo Jaramillo, was
assassinated in Bogota's El Dorado international airport minutes
before he was to board a flight. Authorities blamed that
assassination on drug traffickers.
   Also at the Bogota airport March 3, 1989, a leftist leader, Jose
Antequera, was assassinated in a submachine gun attack by four men.

   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said
after a meeting Sunday with Mikhail S. Gorbachev that he failed to
allay the Soviet leader's concerns about a united Germany's
membership in NATO.
   After the two-hour meeting in the Kremlin, the Soviet news
agency Tass said the Soviet president ``maintains a negative
attitude to the one-sided imbalanced proposal for the inclusion of
the future united German government in NATO.'' It said it was
paraphrasing Gorbachev's remarks.
   De Maiziere said membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization was possible ``if NATO develops a new strategy.''
   Still, de Maiziere said the meeting was ``very constructive,''
and would facilitate German reunification.
   De Maiziere, accompanied by his ministers of defense, foreign
affairs and economics, were in Moscow for a day of talks preceding
negotiations on German reunification May 5 in Bonn, West Germany.
   Representatives of the two Germanys as well as the four
victorious World War II allies _ the United States, the Soviet
Union, Britain and France _ will participate in the talks.
   The West says a united Germany should be a member of NATO.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said in an
interview published Saturday in Ireland that a united Germany
should be non-aligned, and could belong to both the Western
alliance and the Warsaw Pact.
   De Maiziere has said he opposes German neutrality, and also
stationing NATO soldiers on East German territory until a new
all-European security system can be arranged.
   German neutrality ``would be contrary to the spirit of the
times, corresponding instead to the old mentality of blocs,'' he
told Tass in East Berlin Saturday.
   On Sunday, however, he did not say what a European security
system should look like, but did say it should also guarantee
Soviet security.
   ``Gorbachev did not accept our NATO proposal, so other solutions
will have to be found,'' he said.
   Tass said Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov told his East
German counterpart, Rainer Eppelmann, ``a united Germany's
membership in NATO may influence the balance of forces in Europe
and destabilize international relations.''
   Economic relations with a united Germany and ensuring Soviet
security are Moscow's principal concerns. East Germany has been a
key member of the Warsaw Pact military alliance, and an important
trading partner for the Soviet Union.
   De Maiziere said Soviet officials expressed concern that trade
relations will be hurt by East German's expected adoption this
summer of the West German mark as its currency.

   Lithuania's official radio said Sunday that the
Soviet Union was easing its economic blockade against the Baltic
republic by nearly doubling the supply of natural gas. Lithuania's
president said it was only a promise.
   The radio report said the natural gas was bound for a factory
that supplies Moscow with chemicals and fertilizers.
   ``Nothing has been connected,'' Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis told NBC News Sunday afternoon. It was promised that
the gas supply was being increased, he said, ``but that has not
happened.''
   A Lithuanian government spokesman also said that as of late
Sunday, increased gas supplies had not yet arrived.
   Residents of the Baltic republic, which declared independence
March 11, organized a bicycle rally Sunday to show their defiance
of the blockade.
   An estimated 20,000 more gathered in Cathedral Square in the
capital, Vilnius, to hear the republic's orchestra perform
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Landsbergis, a music professor, has
said that for him, the symphony symbolizes hope and humanity's
``victory over slavery.''
   Word of the sudden easing of the gas restriction came after both
Lithuania and a spokesman for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
praised a proposed compromise to their dispute offered by France
and West Germany. The two Western countries proposed Lithuania
delay implementing its independence without rescinding the
declaration itself.
   The Soviet Union has cut off all oil supplies, and shipments of
many manufactured goods, raw materials and food items in an effort
to make Lithuania back away from the declaration of independence.
   Vilnius Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in
London, said the industrial plant at Jonova, whose natural gas
supplies had been drastically cut, was being resupplied. The plant
supplies the Soviet Union with concentrated ammonium, resins,
methanol and other products.
   If the amount promised the plant were delivered, it would nearly
double the total natural gas flowing into the republic.
   But Paul Pauparas, manager of the Supreme Council legislature's
information department, said in a telephone interview that no extra
supplies of gas had been received as of Sunday evening.
   Operators at the plant ``have no exact information whether it
will be really renewed or it is only promises,'' he said.
   He said details of the agreement to increase the flow of gas
likely were provided directly to the plant director by Moscow, but
that government officials in Vilnius had not been able to confirm
specifics.
   Earlier, Rita Radzavicius, a spokeswoman for the information
department, had confirmed that the Jonova plant had started to
receive its allotment of gas.
   The radio said the Jonova plant was to receive about 105 million
cubic feet of natural gas each day _ ``almost sufficient for the
plant to keep operating normally,'' it said.
   Radio Vilnius said from the beginning of the blockade, all of
Lithuania had been receiving about 123 million cubic feet of
natural gas per day _ ``just enough for everyday household needs.''
Before the blockade began, the republic received about 635 million
cubic feet of natural gas a day.
   Pauparas said the Jonova plant had been receiving only about
24.7 million cubic feet of gas a day, and that most of its major
production facilities already had been shut down.
   That meant a loss to the Soviet Union of chemicals and
fertilizers normally supplied by the plant, he said, adding that
Lithuania uses a relatively small proportion of the products made
there.
   If the plant resumes full production, it will continue
fulfilling its previous contracts, Pauparas said.
   The radio said about 30 percent of the plant's work force, or
more than 1,000 people, would be going back to work on Monday. They
had been forced out of work because of shortage of gas.
   There was no official announcement by Moscow of a change of
policy, but in an interview with the Tass news agency Saturday, the
deputy chairman of the Soviet State Supply Committee Vladimir
Kosyunin said Lithuania was receiving 30 percent of its normal
share of natural gas. When the restriction went into effect more
than a week ago, it was receiving only about 16 percent.
   Gorbachev demanded two weeks ago that Lithuania rescind new laws
that exempted Lithuanians from the Soviet military draft, gave
ownership of Communist Party buildings to Lithuania's independent
Communists, and established new rules on citizenship that Russians
living in Lithuania considered discriminatory.
   When the demands were not met, the Kremlin imposed the economic
blockade. Earlier, Moscow seized buildings, conducted military
maneuvers and barred most foreigners from the republic of 3.8
million people.

<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush confessed Sunday to only one
regret about the annual White House Correspondents Association
dinner: She missed Marla.
   Mrs. Bush told reporters that despite trying, she never did
catch a glimpse of the blonde bombshell, Marla Maples, the
so-called other woman in Donald Trump's split with his wife.
   The model and budding actress created a sensation at the
black-tie banquet Saturday night just by showing up as a guest of
Time magazine.
   The first lady, chatting with reporters on the White House lawn
after church, said she had tried to spot Ms. Maples from the dais,
to no avail.
   Many in the crowd of 2,500 reporters, politicians and other
guests who were able to navigate the crowded aisles had better
luck, although two bodyguards kept papparizzi and other
curiosity-seekers from pressing too close to the Time table.
   They couldn't protect Ms. Maples from ``Saturday Night Live''
comedian Dennis Miller, who cracked a few jokes at her expense.
   ``Flew in this afternoon on the Trump Shuttle, or as it's been
affectionately renamed `The Ugly American Airline,'' said Miller,
quickly adding, ``Marla, kidding, kidding. ... I love him, too.''
   Bush did his own stand-up comedy routine, with press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater and his recent diet serving as a foil.
   ``We originally wanted to launch the Hubble Telescope a year ago
to take a group shot of Marlin,'' said Bush. ``No, he looks great,
though.''
   Fitzwater's ``whole attitude has changed,'' said Bush. ``I
remember the day long ago when Pinochet stepped down. I said,
`Isn't it great? Chile is free.' Marlin said, `Good! When do we
eat?'''
   Bush said Fitzwater ``does keep me informed. Recently he said,
`A lot of reporters are talking about the strange stuff we're
seeing on T.V.'
   ``I said, `You mean ``Twin Peaks'' or ``The Simpsons'' or
``Ninja Turtles''? Marlin said, `No, I mean you announcing the
Gorbachev summit while standing next to Michael Jackson,''' said
Bush.
   ``I told him I'm not taking the rap for this Michael Jackson
thing. Rose Garden. Sun glasses. No coat, no tie. No expression.
Bored. A little confused. I just figured he was another White House
correspondent.''
   Bush said, ``We got Dennis tonight because this evening's
`Saturday Night Live' was replaced by Hulk Hogan's `Wrestlemania.'
NBC got first pick.
   ``I every once in a while stay awake and watch this `Saturday
Night Live,''' said Bush.
   Dana Carvey's impression is ``so good that I asked him to phone
Rafsanjani and tell him that it was George Bush, but Dana said,
`Wouldn't be prudent, wouldn't be prudent,''' quipped the president.
   Other famous faces in the crowd included actress Angie Dickinson
and Red Auerbach, chomping a cigar to celebrate a 157-128 record
Boston Celtics romp over the New York Knicks in the National
Basketball Association playoffs.

<HEAD>Parishioners Consider Moving Church Out of Kilauea Lava Flow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAPANA, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An overflow crowd celebrated Mass at
Star of the Sea Church on Sunday as lava from Kilauea Volcano
advanced on them.
   About 50 parishioners met afterward to discuss whether to move
the church, and most appeared to favor saving it. But some wanted
to leave it at the site regardless of the consequences.
   The group decided to forward its opinions to Bishop Joseph
Ferrario, head of the Roman Catholic church in Hawaii, and abide by
his decision.
   One parishioner who spoke in favor of relocating told the story
of a man trapped on the roof of his home during a flood. When a
boat came by, the man declined a ride, saying he was waiting for a
sign from God. He then declined a ride in a helicopter.
   Finally, he drowned. When he went to Heaven, he asked God why he
didn't send a sign. ``What do you mean,'' God replied. ``I sent you
a boat and a helicopter.''
   ``God gave us the intelligence to save this church,'' the
parishioner said.
   A female church elder, though, told the group that if they loved
their church they should allow it to stand at its present site.
   During a previous Kilauea eruption in 1977, a lava flow that
scientists said was nearly certain to overrun the town and the
Painted Church petered out three-quarters of a mile from the
church. Some Kalapana residents called it a miracle.
   Bruce Butts of Hawaii County civil defense said the flow has
moved within 400 yards of the town's center, not far from the site
of the church.
   No more homes had been destroyed by early Sunday afternoon,

The flow had light to moderate movement overnight.
   Remaining residents of the subdivision were ordered to move
their belongings out, as lava threatened to block off the two
remaining access roads to the subdivision.

<HEAD>Six Dead, Seven Missing After Italian Ferry Sinks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRAPANI, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ferry carrying 52 passengers and crew
sank off the Sicilian coast Sunday evening, leaving six people dead
and seven missing, authorities said.
   The 3,500-ton Trapani Express about a mile from this port city
on Sicily's western coast. It had left Saturday evening from the
Tuscan port of Leghorn.
   Authorities said the ferry carried 34 passengers and 18 crew
members. The bodies of five men and one woman were recovered.
   A Trapani port official, who would not give his name, said 39
passengers and crew were rescued and taken to a Trapani hospital.
   ``They are in good condition,'' he said. ``Some have symptoms of
shock.''
   No foreigners were aboard the ferry, he said.
   Coast Guard ships continued searching for the missing seven, but
there was little hope they would be found alive.
   Besides passengers, the ferry carried cars and trucks. The
Italian news agency ANSA said initial reports indicated the
accident occurred after one of the trucks tipped over, causing the
ship to list.
   At the time, most of the passengers were on deck preparing to
disembark. Many jumped into the sea when the ship started to go
down, officials said.
   The crew radioed for help, but by the time rescue boats arrived
10 minutes later, the ferry had already sunk.
   A local magistrate opened an investigation to determine whether
criminal negligence was involved.

<HEAD>Riots Break Out at Two French Prisons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LILLE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A revolt was quelled at one prison but
trouble broke out hours later at another, with about 50 inmates
taking refuge Sunday on the jailhouse roof, authorities said.
   On Saturday, about 500 prisoners went on a rampage at the
Loos-Les-Lille prison after an exercise period, setting fire to a
prison workshop and a garage. Fifty prisoners at Loos-Les-Lille
held out overnight on the prison roof but agreed to return to their
cells Sunday morning.
   Hours later, a similar scenario developed at nearby Douai
prison. Inmates refused to return to their cells after an exercise
period, set fire to some paper stocks and cartons, and took to the
roof, where they remained Sunday night.
   Loos-Les-Lille, located about 125 miles north of Paris near the
Belgian border, is about 25 miles from Douai. A series of prison
revolts in July 1987 began with disturbances at the two facilities.
   Justice Minister Pierre Arpaillange promised Sunday that
measures would soon be adopted to improve prison conditions.
   ``I have long understood that this is urgent,'' Arpaillange said.
   The weekend rebellions were the first in French prisons this
year, but there were at least 10 such revolts in 1989.
   Authorities and police managed to retake control of the
Loos-Les-Lille prison interior hours after the rebellion. But
negotiations with the inmates on the roof continued until after
midnight.
   Food and blankets were relayed to the prisoners on the roof from
cells below, according to a local official, speaking on condition
he not be named.
   ``The night brought with it counsel,'' said state prosecutor
Olivier Guerin of the holdouts' decision to turn themselves in.
   More than 1,000 inmates are housed at the Loos-Les-Lille prison,
which was built for a capacity of about 550, prison officials said.
There is no problem of overpopulation at Douai, where officials say
540 inmates are housed in a facility with a capacity for 575
prisoners.
   The demands of the inmates at Loos-Les-Lille were never
clear-cut, but prison officials said the complaints centered on the
slowness and reported inequality of the justice system.
   The inmates also were upset that guards had fired on four
escaping prisoners Jan. 28. The four were caught three days later.
None had been wounded by the gunfire.

<HEAD>French Forensic Experts Say Film of Rumanian Dictator's, Wife's
Death Faked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A film released by Romania's interim government
showing the firing-squad execution of former leaders Nicolae and
Elena Ceausescu was faked, according to French forensic experts
cited by The Sun of Baltimore.
   The conclusion furthers suspicions among experts on the country
that the two probably were victims of a coup d'etat carried out
under cover of the popular revolution, the newspaper reported
Sunday from its Paris bureau.
   The 90-minute film of Ceausescus' trial and execution, which
appeared in pirated and official versions on French television last
week, indicated the couple may have been killed separately by
single shots to their heads and their corpses later propped up for
a staged execution, forensic experts in Paris said.
   The bodies should have been bullet-riddled, but when lifted for
the camera were not bloody, said the analysts, who were not
identified by the newspaper.
   Elena Ceausescu lay over a stream of blood, but when a doctor
lifted her head it was stiff and no blood trickled out. The
forensic experts said the blood on her head and on the ground had
coagulated. They said rigor mortis had set in and that she must
have been dead for four or five hours.
   Near her, her husband, lying backward on his knees, appeared
more pliable. His head bobbed when doctors lifted it. But again, no
blood trickled. The experts concluded he had probably been killed
well after his wife.
   The footage, also broadcast in Romania last week, was released
by Romania's interim government in the apparent belief that it
would rally support for the ruling National Salvation Front before
the May 20 elections.
   The footage shows the trial and, after an abrupt break, cuts to
the ostensible execution by firing squad. The film did not show the
dictator and his wife as they awaited the gunfire. Rather, it cut
to a four-second burst of gunfire across a field, raising a cloud
of smoke and dust against a wall.
   Rasvan Theodorescu, president of the government-owned Free
Romanian Television station, which released one version of the
trial and execution, denied last week that the firing squad
execution could have been faked. He said there were no more than
five minutes between the sentence and execution.
   Analysts have said the National Salvation Front probably planned
the coup for a later date but went into action with the first
reports of anti-Ceausescu protests springing up in Timisoara Dec.
15.
   ``There was a plot to overthrow Ceausescu,'' said Pierre
Hassner, a Romanian-born specialist on Eastern Europe at the Center
of International Study and Research in Paris. ``There was also a
movement from below.''
   Hassner said leaders of the front appeared to have known each
other before the uprising and there have been reports in the French
press that several of them visited the Soviet Union before assuming
power.
   The film, an extended version of the brief footage shown
earlier, for the first time shows the faces of the 10-man military
tribunal that judged the Ceausescus. Sitting on the tribunal were
the current deputy prime minister Gelu Voican, and Victor
Stanculescu, a former general of the feared Securitate security
police who is now defense minister.

<HEAD>Campaign Officially Begins; Havel Says Two Years Needed For Real
Democracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campaigning officially began
Sunday for the country's first free elections five weeks away, but
President Vaclav Havel said real democracy is at least two years
away.
   ``These elections are more like a rehearsal,'' Havel said.
``They are free enough but happening in a politically immature
situation.''
   Speaking in his regular Sunday radio broacast, Havel also said
he would seek another two-year term as president if it would help
see through the transition to full democracy.
   ``In case it turns out to be necessary, I'll do it,'' he said.
   The elections, the first free balloting after more than four
decades of Communist rule, are scheduled for June 8-9. A total of
23 parties and movements are competing for seats in the new
Parliament, and campaigning officially began Sunday.
   The new Parliament, which is to implement far-reaching economic
reforms, will have a two-year mandate.
   In the elections, based on proportional representation, only
parties that win at least 5 percent of the national vote will gain
seats in Parliament. This is considered likely to exclude from
Parliament several of the smaller parties competing.
   Opinion polls published in the last week indicated the Civic
Forum, a loose opposition group founded by Havel that played a key
role in overthrowing the hard-line Communist leadership last year,
is among the most popular political movements, with the support of
about 20 percent of the voters.
   The coalition of Christian Democrats, expected to gain support
in Slovakia, the country's strongly Roman Catholic easternmost
part, is a close second.
   Civic Forum last week announced an informal coalition with the
environmentalist Greens, another movement enjoying popular support
in a country devastated by four decades of industrialization that
ignored ecological concerns.
   The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, still claiming 1 million
members in a population of 15.5 million, is under continuous attack
by opposition parties. Anti-Communist sentiment is considered
likely to be a campaign issue.
   ``I strongly believe that the democratic forces, the only
guarantee of democracy in this country, will prevail,'' Havel said.
``The citizens must go out and take part in the elections because
everyone's vote will count in deciding about the future of this
country.''

<HEAD>Man Confesses to Dozens of Rapes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man police believe is the ``ski mask'' serial
rapist has confessed to dozens of sexual attacks since early 1985,
but investigators said they have linked only 17 cases to him.
   Gilbert H. Escobedo, a 38-year-old co-owner of an auto detail
shop and a convicted burglar, has confessed to raping as many as 30
women in Dallas, police said. They said Escobedo couldn't remember
the names of all the victims.
   ``We're in agreement on the 17,'' said Ray Hawkins, deputy
police chief in Dallas. ``There are more, but it's not a situation
where he's bragging. Quite frankly, it's a situation where we're
not going to put more on him than we can be sure we can prove.''
   Escobedo was arrested Tuesday night while allegedly trying to
break into a woman's apartment, police said.
   He was held Sunday for investigation of aggravated sexual
assault and attempted burglary.
   Police said Escobedo is a convicted burglar who has served time
in Texas prisons off and on since 1972. Investigators had
questioned Escobedo in the past in the string of rapes and had been
watching him, police detective R.E. Rommel said.
   The ski mask rapist, known for his burglary skills, gained the
nickname because of the masks he often wore.
   The series of rapes began in 1985. Most victims were women in
their early 20s and were awakened and raped by a man who had broken
in through a door or window, police said. The attacker usually
threatened the women with a gun.
   The last attack attributed to the serial rapist was March 10,
police said.

   Four bombs exploded Sunday in the
offices of the Colombian consulate in the western Venezuela city of
Barinas, causing $12,000 in damage but no injuries, police said.
   A guerrilla group called ``Jaime Batema'' claimed responsibility
for the attack, saying it was in protest of Thursday's
assassination of leftist Colombian presidential candidate Carlos
Pizarro. The group was previously unknown.
   The bombs exploded early Sunday in the third floor of the
three-story consular building in Barinas, 250 miles from Caracas,
the police said. The blasts destroyed furniture, smashed windows
and burned most of the consulate's files, Colombian Consul Jaime
Restrepo Marin said.
   Witnesses said a message was written on the wall at the scene,
saying: ``Pizarro: they will not kill your wish of peace.''
   Pizarro was a former leader of the Colombian M-19 guerrilla
organization that gave up arms to become a political party. He was
killed by a gunman while aboard a commercial flight between Bogota
and Barranquilla.
   The gunman was killed by Pizarro's bodyguards, and the Colombian
government has not said who was responsible for the assassination.
   An anonymous caller told The Associated Press in Caracas that
the bombs Sunday were designed to call public attention over
``political assassinations in Colombia.'' The caller gave no
details.

   Bad weather forced a halt Sunday to the
search for six people believed killed when their light plane
crashed into a mountain in heavy snow.
   Rescuers faced a snowstorm with winds up to 50 mph and said the
winter-like weather was expected to continue through Tuesday.
   A TV news helicopter crew spotted the wreckage of the
single-engine Piper Cherokee on Saturday morning in the Rocky
Mountains, about 15 miles northeast of Aspen.
   Among those believed dead are four members of a Sweet Adelines
singing group from Salt Lake City. The group, including the husband
of one of the singers, left Salt Lake City on Friday for a regional
singing competition in Colorado Springs.
   The plane was found about 400 feet below the Continental Divide,
underneath a 20-foot cornice of snow.
   Searchers found three bodies Saturday and managed to flag their
locations before an avalanche drove crews from the mountain for the
day, Pitkin County sheriff's officials said.
   The sheriff's department may try to fly a plane over the crash
site Thursday if the weather clears, said Sgt. Skitch Rounsefell.
   Michael Kendrick, a sheriff's spokesman, identified the pilot as
David Porter. The other victims were identified as Vern and Ann
Schmidt, Kathy Ashbey, Kelly Carlson and Maureen Polletti, all from
the Salt Lake City area.

<TEXT>
   Some musicals start out being fun, then let you
down. ``A Change in the Heir'' does the opposite.
   Its prologue gives you a sinking feeling. Then it slowly charms
you into enjoying yourself.
   ``A Change in the Heir,'' in which the whimsy is as thick as
fog, opened Sunday at the Edison Theater on Broadway.
   Love potions, truth potions, intercepted homing pigeons, slides
down a firemen's pole abound. One wonders how much audience
there'll be for a fairy tale told with near-camp goofiness.
   In the prologue, coyly set ``long, long ago, in a castle far,
far away,'' two royal babies are born the same day. Because of a
complicated scheme of who'll become ruler, parents of the girl say
she's a boy and the boy's parents announce a girl. Cabbage Patch
dolls are exhibited, in blue and pink.
   Twenty years later, raised that way, they return to the castle
for coronation. Aunt Julia, patterned on the ``Snow White'' wicked
queen and dirty-tricks politicians, wants to prevent a coronation
and continue her evil reign. Brooks Almy, playing her in flamboyant
Dorothy Loudon style, wildly overdoes her big number, ``Hold That
Crown,'' but it's fun anyway.
   Judy Blazer, a delight as Prince Conrad, displays some of the
vocal quality that Judy Garland had. The songs win over the
audience, too, with their appealing melodies and understated but
clever lyrics.
   Prince Conrad, in kingly blue, and Princess Agnes, played by
tall, deep-voiced Jeffrey Herbst, in a pink gown, fall in love.
Agnes thinks they should flee. Conrad feels duty-bound to stay and
be king. They sort it out in a nice finale but it's less fun than
the hysterical ending of Act 1 which has 10 people popping in, out
and around the scenery.
   Stars of the show are Miss Blazer, the final Sally in Broadway's
``Me and My Girl,'' and composer-book writer Dan Sticco and
lyricist-book writer George H. Gorham. The New Tuners Theater in
Chicago performed ``A Change in the Heir'' in 1988.
   Brian Sutherland and Jan Neuberger were fine comic foils for the
evil Julia. J.K. Simmons, Mary Stout and Connie Day were good as
royal parents, David Gunderman and Jennifer Smith as servants.
Bright scenery and costumes were by Michael Anania and David Murin
respectively.
   David H. Bell directed. Stewart F. Lane produced.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Bishop Urges Using Military Aid for Social Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCOS ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A San Salvador bishop said
Sunday that U.S. military aid to his country should be used to aid
the poor and solve social problems that have fueled the 10-year-old
civil war.
   ``Weapons must be traded for plows as soon as possible,'' Bishop
Gregorio Rosa Chavez said in his Sunday sermon.
   ``Our youth have no hope for the future while working conditions
don't change, while we don't overcome the unemployment problem,
while the working man is not the main cause of worry of the
government,'' he said.
   On Thursday the House Foreign Relations Committee approved a
proposal to cut in half its annual $85 million in military aid to
El Salvador.
   But the House also specified that the money would be restored if
Salvadoran rebels continue to receive foreign arms, mount a
military offensive or thwart proposed peace talks.
   The House also stated that the aid would be cut completely if
the government does not negotiate with the rebels in good faith or
fails to adequately investigate the murder of six Jesuits last year.
   Funds cut from the military aid program are to go toward social
programs in El Salvador.
   Right-wing President Alfredo Cristiani has threatened to slash
social programs to increase the military budget if the U.S. aid is
reduced.
   ``It is grave for me to think that the war should be paid for by
the poorest, those who suffer the most because of the war,'' Rosa
Chavez said.
   Hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans have been displaced by the
fighting, and unemployment or underemployment in the country is
estimated at almost 45 percent.
   ``Weapons are always a danger, which is why peace is not built
with weapons, it is built with reason and dialogue,'' Rosa Chavez
said.
   Rosa Chavez is one of San Salvador's bishops and an auxiliary to
Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas.
   U.N. officials have agreed to act as intermediaries in a new
round of peace talks scheduled to begin Wednesday.
   The Salvadoran church has been a severe critic of the war that
has claimed some 72,000 lives and was a prime influence in the
start of earlier peace talks.

<HEAD>Girls Incorporated: No Longer a Club, Girls Getting Serious</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Girls Clubs of America is no more _ the name
was too, well, girlish. Take a memo, please: it's now called Girls
Incorporated.
   In what officials called a historic vote Sunday, the national
organization that once concentrated on homemaking skills, hobbies
and charm is showing its evolution with the new name.
   ``This is the biggest thing that's happened to us in the 45
years we've been operating,'' said executive director Margaret
Gates. ``It means that we'll be framing a new identity for a
45-year-old organization.''
   Actually, that framing began five to 10 years ago, she said,
when the Clubs spent more than $10 million to develop new
educational programs, such as a science and math project called
Operation SMART.
   Ms. Gates, emerging from the organization's annual board meeting
in Atlanta Sunday, said the 80 board members present approved the
new name in an ``overwhelming'' voice vote.
   ``We thought that `club' sounded a little recreational. Right
now a lot of the work we're doing with girls is more educational,''
Ms. Gates said.
   The name change also was prompted by the Boys Clubs of America's
decision two years ago to add ``Girls'' to its name to reflect its
growing female membership.
   The Girls Club became concerned that the Boys Clubs' new name
would obscure its identity and confuse the donors who provide about
80 percent of the operating budget.
   ``That was the catalyst,'' Ms. Gates said.
   In any case, the Clubs haven't been ``clubby'' in years, with
the emphasis shifting to educating and preparing girls to compete
and compensate for subtle sexism they may encounter while growing
up.
   The Clubs cite evidence that shows such inequities begin in the
classroom. Studies show girls fare more poorly than boys on the
Scholastic Aptitude Test although they generally score the same as
or higher than boys on standardized tests in elementary school.
   Other studies, including one by American University professors
Myra and David Sadker, show that boys get more attention in
classrooms, are encouraged to do their own work without teacher
help and are disciplined more effectively, which helps them deal
with criticism better.
   There are 250,000 girls in Girls Incorporated, but there are
also 65,000 boys, who often are admitted in one of the group's 200

<HEAD>Four Die of Head Injuries When Boat Slams Into Dock</HEAD>

   A ski boat crashed into a wooden dock
on a lake Sunday, killing the three men and one woman aboard,
authorities said.
   The victims were discovered by a local man at about 11 a.m. when
the crippled boat, bodies inside, drifted near his backyard on
Doctors Lake south of Jacksonville.
   ``I saw the boat against the shore and it looked like some
fishermen were sleeping,'' said Leslie Teller, 70. ``I went over
and then I saw one with a big gash in his forehead and I knew they
were all dead.''
   The victims apparently died instantly, said Capt. William M.
Glover of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   ``It appears they ran under the dock,'' Glover said. ``The
victims, who were sitting in their seats, had severe head injuries.
The dock sheared the windshield off and tore the outboard engine
off the boat.''
   The private boat dock apparently did not have, and was not
required to have, any lighting or reflectors, Glover said.
Authorities haven't determined how fast the ski boat, which had a
150-horsepower outboard engine, was going.
   ``We had two lake-area residents tell us that they heard a loud
noise between 1 and 2 a.m. Sunday morning,'' said Sgt. Chuck
Vavrek, a Clay County Sheriff's Department spokesman. ``It appears
that they just did not see the dock.''
   Authorities identified the victims as Anthony Raymond Bosten,
21, and Steven Lewis Findley, 26, both of Middleburg; and Debra A.
Lee, 28, and James Daniel Rooney, 25, both of Jacksonville. None
wore life vests.
   State fish and game officers searched the water near the dock
for about five hours Sunday, but no other victims were found,
Vavrek said.
   Authorities also found several containers of beer inside the
boat, but Glover declined to discuss whether alcohol might have
contributed to the accident.

   Pope John Paul II on Sunday expressed his
``suffering and profound concern'' over difficulties faced by
Christian churches in Jerusalem.
   ``Let us pray that everyone takes to heart the search of
solutions inspired by justice and the respect of rights,'' the
pontiff said in his Sunday noon Angelus remarks.
   On Friday, Christian leaders in Jerusalem closed their churches
to protest against the April 11 occupation by 150 Jewish settlers
of a building complex owned by the Greek Orthodox Church.
   The churches were reopened Saturday, but Christian leaders are
threatening to close them again if the Jewish settlers remain in
the Christian quarter of the Old City.
   Israel's Supreme Court has ordered the Jewish settlers out by
Tuesday but said it will allow 20 guards and maintenance staff to
remain pending a final ruling on the dispute.
   Speaking from his apartment window overlooking St. Peter's
Square, the pope said:
   ``I wish to invite you to be spiritually close with me to the
brothers of East Jerusalem, especially to the leaders of the
venerable Christian churches. The grave incidents which occurred
recently in the Holy City, and which led to the painful decision to
close the Holy Sites temporarily, particularly the Basilica of the
Holy Sepulchre, are also for me reason for suffering and profound
concern.''
   John Paul said he was praying for peace in Jerusalem, ``a city
that is preeminently holy and dear to all three monotheistic
religions.''
   The Old City, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, is
the site of Jewish, Moslem and Christian holy places.

<HEAD>Exiled ANC Leader Says Armed Struggle Led to Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white African National Congress
leader who returned from exile told a large rally Sunday that the
threat of war with South Africa's black majority forced the
white-led government to negotiate.
   ``There can't be any doubt that because we spoke with an AK-47
that dialogue is in the air,'' said Joe Slovo, leader of the South
African Communist Party and a member of the ANC executive, speaking
before an estimated 30,000 people.
   Slovo, a former commander of the ANC's military wing, was
referring to the Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifle.
   At the same rally ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela urged
white South Africans to ``make it possible'' for the ANC to throw
away its guns.
   ``We don't want this country reduced to ashes,'' he said.
   Slovo and other ANC leaders returned to South Africa after
President F.W. De Klerk legalized the ANC, the Communist Party and
58 other organizations in February. Mandela was freed from prison
at that time.
   The ANC leaders told the mostly black crowd that they would
demand majority rule and a redistribution of wealth when they
negotiate with the white government.
   An ANC delegation led by Mandela is scheduled to meet with de
Klerk and members of his Cabinet for three days of preliminary
talks starting on Wednesday.
   De Klerk has said that ANC calls for armed struggle and
widespread violence in black townships, most of it between ANC
supporters and rival black groups, hinder negotiations.
   Mandela told the crowd that the government had objected to
Slovo's inclusion in the ANC delegation because he is a Communist.
   But Mandela called Slovo ``a true son of South Africa'' and said
that Communists will be represented in the ANC delegation.
   ``We are going to do nothing to betray those who have stood
loyally by us for so many years,'' Mandela said. About half of the
ANC's executive committee are Communists.

   The first court-martial of officers
charged in connection with a December coup attempt was postponed
Monday because the room was too small and there was no electricity
due to the country's power crisis.
   Twenty-one officers, including two generals, were to have gone
on trial for their roles in the Dec. 1-9 failed coup, the bloodiest
of six attempts to oust President Corazon Aquino.
   But chief judge Brig. Gen. Demetrio Camua rescheduled the
proceedings until May 8 after scores of reporters and other
spectators jammed the small courtroom, whose air-conditioner then
failed due to a power outage.
   Chief Prosecutor Col. Anciano Disierto originally suggested the
trial be put off until next Monday, May 7.
   Then defense lawyers and tribunal members reminded him that
electricity was to be cut that day throughout Manila because of the
nation's power crisis. The trial date was then set for the
following day.
   Overcrowding and electrical failure were not the only problems
on the opening day of the trial, which was to underscore the Aquino
government's commitment to crack down on the mutineers.
   During the proceedings, a defense lawyer, retired Col. Mariano
Santiago, pointed out that Philippine flag behind the tribunal was
inverted. Military rebels use the inverted national flag as their
banner.
   Spectators broke into laughter as embarrassed guards scurried to
pull down the flag.
   Defendants in the case include air force Brig. Gen. Jose
Commendador and army Brig. Gen. Marcelo Blando. They were among six
senior officials charged with participating in the December
rebellion, in which 113 people died and more than 600 were wounded.
   Retired Brig. Gen. Felix Brawner has been charged with rebellion
and murder but no date was set for his trial before a civilian
court. Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina is still on trial for his role in
an August 1987 coup attempt.
   A retired general and an active duty navy commodore are still at
large.
   Other defendants in the court-martial included two navy
captains, one colonel, seven lieutenant colonels, three majors,
five army captains and one air force lieutenant.
   All are charged with mutiny, murder and attempted murder and
conduct unbecoming an officer. They face sentences of life
imprisonment if convicted on all charges.
   The most severe penalty handed down so far by a military court
to leaders of five previous coup attempts was 20 years of hard
labor. That sentence was meted out to a lieutenant colonel, two
majors and three captains in connection with a failed rebellion in
January 1987.
   A seven-member tribunal, headed by Brig. Gen. Demetrio Camua,
will hear the case at armed forces headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo.
   Commendador is accused of leading the takeover of Mactan Air
Base in Cebu, 350 miles southeast of Manila. The air base was the
last stronghold given up by the rebels in the December attempt.
   Blando, former commanding general of the 7th Infantry Division,
allegedly defied orders to reinforce loyal troops in Manila. He is
also accused of trying to persuade loyal officers to stop fighting
the mutineers.
   Blando moved his troops from Fort Magsaysay to Manila, 70 miles
to the south, but refused to order them into battle, according to
the charges.
   Military investigators have recommended 60 other officers be
court-martialed in connection with the failed coup, the strongest
and bloodiest attempt to topple the 4-year-old Aquino
administration.
   More than 2,200 officers and enlisted personnel are in custody
pending completion of investigations of their roles in the
rebellion.
   Among the civilians facing charges in the overthrow attempt is
Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, who was fired as defense minister after a
failed coup by his followers in November 1986.
   Enrile was freed on bail in March, and no date has been set for
his trial.
   There have been at least six coup attempts against the
government led by Mrs. Aquino, who took office in February 1986
after a popular revolution deposed former President Ferdinand
Marcos.

1960, disrupting a summit meeting 19 days later in Paris between
President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita S.
Khrushchev and forcing the cancellation of another summit planned
for later that year.
   Red Star, the Soviet army newspaper, said the Soviets lost a
MiG-19 and its pilot in the operation.
   The paper also disclosed for the first time that the Soviets
sent up a new fighter plane and ordered its pilot to ram the U-2 in

<HEAD>USX Vote on Proposal Is Test of Raider's Strength in the '90s</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY9 of April 26</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   When Carl Icahn's proposal to break up USX Corp.
comes to a vote at the steel-energy company's annual meeting next
week, shareholders will be passing judgment on how much influence a
corporate raider has now that the easy-money takeover boom seems to
be over.
   If Icahn's proposal to spin off the company's U.S. Steel
subsidiary is rejected _ as management hopes it will be _ he could
still emerge a winner and make strategists like himself a more
powerful force in U.S. corporations.
   ``Sometimes something good comes out of a battle that's lost,''
said Robert W. Vishny, a University of Chicago Graduate School of
Business professor.
   Israel Shaked, a professor at Boston University's School of
Management, predicted, ``Even if they (USX management) win, I think
they are going to do something _ unless they have a clear loss for
Icahn.''
   Icahn, USX's largest shareholder with a 13.3 percent stake, has
hounded USX management for years to restructure, sell assets and
raise the company's stock price. Company executives have agreed
that their stock is undervalued, but they have consistently
dismissed Icahn's suggestions on ways to improve it.
   The takeover strategist, who is also the chairman of Trans World
Airlines, originally threatened a shareholder-proxy fight for
control of the USX board at the May 7 meeting in Findlay, Ohio.
   But he agreed to put that idea aside in exchange for a
non-binding vote on his proposal to separate the firm's struggling
steel assets from its healthier Marathon Oil Co. subsidiary.
   Icahn is in a similar position to that held by Texas investor
Harold Simmons, who waged a proxy fight for control of Lockheed
Corp. in March.
   Simmons, Lockheed's biggest stockholder, lost that vote, but he
helped awaken the defense firm's big institutional investors, who
in turn forced Lockheed management to make some big concessions.
Simmons proved that the threat of a raid or a proxy fight can shift
some of the balance of power from management to shareholders.
   ``There's just a lot more pressure brought to bear on the
board'' in a stockholder vote, Vishny said.
   If Icahn can garner a majority, it will strengthen the hands of
big investors like him and companies likely will see more dissident
proposals and proxy battles going to shareholder votes.
   Proxy fights were in vogue in the days before it became
relatively easy to acquire a company by selling junk bonds, a risky
form of IOU popularized during the 1980s takeover era. Famed
raiders such as Icahn, Simmons and T. Boone Pickens once wielded
enormous threats simply by saying they had the junk bond financing
to back them up.
   But the use of junk bonds in takeover strategies has sharply
dropped since the collapse of the Federated Department Stores Inc.
debt-financed buyout last fall. That collapse caused the value of
many junk bonds to tumble.
   The notion of taking proposals to shareholders or trying to win
control in a proxy fight has regained some lost appeal.
   Whether Icahn wins or loses will not be determined solely by a
vote count. He alluded to that possibility himself last week during
a meeting with investors and analysts.
   If his proposal fails, Icahn said he would look at ``how badly I
lose'' and whether USX management made any promises to investors _
as Lockheed did in its battle with Simmons _ before deciding what
his next step would be.
   Others who have followed the wrangling between companies and
takeover investors agree that the size of the vote is important.
   ``If 48 percent (of the shareholders) are dissatisfied and you
are a responsible member of the board, you don't say `business as
usual,'' said Boston University's Shaked.
   ``If they restructure and eventually split, he will win
anyway,'' he said.
   Icahn also has history on his side.
   Harry DeAngelo, a professor at the University of Michigan, said
that in past proxy fights, ``even though the dissidents usually
lose the vote, in the overwhelming majority of cases, they
accomplish some of their objectives.''
   He cited as an example the board of Allegis Corp., now known as
UAL Corp. Faced with a proxy fight and intensifying shareholder
anger, it canned Chairman Richard Ferris in 1987 and sold the
company's assets except for United Airlines. That was exactly the
path the dissidents wanted the company to take.
   ``They didn't win a vote or gain control of the corporation, but
they got something important,'' DeAngelo said.
   Icahn himself is proof that a loser can still come out ahead. He
lost a proxy fight at Texaco Inc. in 1988, but the nation's
third-largest oil company later restructured by selling billions of
dollars in assets and issuing an $8 a share dividend _ which gave
Icahn a $338.6 million bonus.
   Negative publicity about companies and their problems has helped
further the process of change in many cases _ including Lockheed,
Allegis and Texaco _ and this could be a factor at USX as well.
   ``Pressure to do something in terms of splitting up the assets
is already being felt,'' Shaked said.

   Sir James Goldsmith's failed takeover of BAT
Industries PLC underscores growing anti-takeover sentiment in the
United States and distaste for American-style megabids in Europe,
experts say.
   The Goldsmith-led investor group, Hoylake Investments Ltd., last
week said it wouldn't renew its hostile $22 billion offer for the
British conglomerate. The move came amid roadblocks to U.S. state
regulatory approval.
   The purchase would have been the world's second-largest takeover
after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s $25 billion acquisition of
RJR Nabisco Inc., completed early last year.
   ``The era of truly giant takeovers may now be consigned with
some confidence to the 1980s,'' the daily economic newspaper the
Financial Times wrote.
   The general demise of the U.S. junk bond market and the guilty
plea last week by junk bond wizard Michael Milken have increased
negative attitudes toward the high-yield, high-risk bonds, and the
takeovers they financed.
   California state insurance regulator two weeks ago blocked a
change of ownership of BAT's Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los
Angeles. Hoylake had planned to sell Farmers to the French
insurance company Axa-Midi Assurances.
   The offer also needed the green light from eight other states
where Farmers operates. Hoylake suspended its bid last September
while it sought the clearances.
   The failure illustrates the increasingly complex, international
nature of takeovers, said Joanna Gant, deputy editor of the British
publication Acquisitions Monthly.
   Goldsmith, who built his reputation of taking over and breaking
up American companies, hoped the grass would be greener in Europe.
He was joined by British merchant banker Jacob Rothschild and
Australian businessman Kerry Packer.
   ``Certainly the U.S. is becoming more defensive,'' Ms. Gant
said. ``People thought it was the Japanese who they were afraid of,
and now it seems they are afraid of anyone from overseas.''
   That includes the British, with whom Americans traditionally
have had strong ties.
   Norton Co. workers burned a Union Jack on the steps of the
Worcester, Mass., city hall last month to protest a $1.6 billion
takeover bid for the abrasives maker by the British industrial
company BTR PLC.
   Earlier this month, the Massachusetts legislature rushed
approval of a bill designed to bolster Norton's defense by
requiring staggered terms for corporate directors, with only
one-third elected each year. That makes it almost impossible for a
raider to gain board control quickly.
   Norton last week accepted a friendly $1.8 billion offer from the
French glass maker Compagnie Saint-Gobain.
   The U.S. barriers are raising alarms in Britain, whose companies
are big buyers of American businesses.
   ``It would be tempting to dismiss state anti-takeover laws as
just a fit of temporary madness,'' The Economist magazine wrote.
But they represent ``a growing contempt for shareholders, combined
with a revolt against all forms of takeover,'' it said.
   Jonathan Mervis, chief executive of J.P. Mervis and Co. Ltd., a
London-based acquisitions adviser, said: ``Anti-takeover measures
give incumbent management the right to run the business without
really being answerable to anyone, to their shareholders.
   ``That will cause the pendulum the swing the other way,'' he
said.
   The Hoylake offer had appeared unlikely to succeed, even without
U.S. obstacles. In the end, it only garnered between 1 percent and
2 percent of BAT's stock.
   Critics objected to the highly leveraged nature of the bid,
which was to have been 80 percent debt-financed. Hoylake belatedly
said it might include some cash in the offer.
   A probable factor in Goldsmith's failure was the collapse of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the junk bond investment firm that
Hoylake had hired to help line up its financing.
   Another factor was BAT's quick response to the bid. It launched
a major restructuring, selling and spinning off its retailing and
paper businesses to concentrate on tobacco and financial services.
   The plan, which also involves BAT buying up to 10 percent of its
own stock and increasing dividends, was designed to enhance value
to shareholders.
   Goldsmith and other BAT critics had complained that BAT's shares
did not reflect the true value of the company because they were
dragged down by the relatively slow growth of its tobacco
operations. Goldsmith had proposed ``unbundling'' BAT by selling
off its non-tobacco businesses.

   Jill Zalben says her gift baskets make a
lovely Mother's Day gift, nicely wrapped in cellophane and full of
things mom would want: a flashlight, purified drinking water and
antibiotic ointment.
   Even mothers, Ms. Zalben notes, should be prepared for an
earthquake.
   The Earthquake-Disaster Gift Basket was among thousands of
quake-related items available at sales booths at the Earthquake
Preparedness Show over the weekend.
   A growing number of entrepreneurs have found profit in quake
preparedness as they cater to public nervousness in an increasingly
shaky California following last year's devastating San Francisco
quake.
   Big companies are among those jumping on the readiness
bandwagon, such as Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. with tough-tested hardware
and Honda with shiny red generators.
   Everything from $1.50 bags of freeze-dried food to an $8,500
quake warning system for schools was featured at the show in booths
decorated with colorful balloons and grisly photographs of
earthquake death and destruction.
   The show also included exhibits by utilities and government
agencies to tell jittery Californians how to store supplies, turn
off the gas and survive after a big quake.
   Ms. Zalben, who calls herself ``The Earthquake Lady,'' offered
the most attractive packaging for earthquake survival supplies,
with prices ranging from $49.99 for the small model to $149.99 for
the deluxe basket.
   The baskets also include such items as carbohydrate food bars
(3,600 calories each), surgical tape, waterproof pill vial,
cleansing towelettes in foil packets, AM radio (battery included)
and a box of waterproof matches.
   Ms. Zalben, who also operates camping supply stores, came up
with the idea after last October's San Francisco earthquake, a
7.1-magnitude temblor that killed more than 60 people and caused at
least $6 billion in damage.
   ``We thought this would be a soft way of giving an item that's
real serious,'' she said, standing next to a sign that read, ``Is
Your Mother Prepared?''
   Like Ms. Zalben, most of the vendors' entrepreneurial spirit was
jolted by the San Francisco quake or the two 1987 Whittier quakes
that killed eight people and caused $358 million in damage.
   The Whittier Narrows Quake gave Norm Anderson the idea of
building plastic containers. Sealed with a weatherproof lid, the
containers are buried in the back yard for storing quake supplies
that could be damaged or inaccessible in a destroyed house.
   His Disaster Survival Vaults cost $49 for the 74-gallon ``home
model'' and $389 for the 40-gallon ``executive model.''
   Several booths offered a variety of light sources, including
flashlights operated by battery, by a crank or mounted on a pair of
glassless eyeglasses.
   ``In earthquakes ... the power goes off and you have to get to a
problem, maybe you need both of your hands free,'' said Frank
Tusuei, who was selling the ``Magic Eyes!!! A Flashlight
Substitution'' for $7.95. Batteries are extra.
   Gary Martin said quake victims might not need a flashlight at
all if they buy his Cyalume Lightsticks. All one has to do is
unwrap his plastic cylinders, bend one in half, and a chemical
reaction produces 12 hours of artificial light.
   And don't worry if it's too dark to unwrap the lightstick. ``The
box glows in the dark,'' Martin explained. A glowing box of two
sells for $8 to $9.
   Vendors said they felt no shame making a quick buck off people's
fears of earthquakes, especially the Big One, the 7.5 to 8
magnitude quake that scientists believe is at least 60 percent
likely to strike Southern California by the year 2018.
   Jim Chapkis, who sells survival kits packed into cardboard boxes
selling at a ``quake-show special'' of $39.95 to $199.95, said,
``If somebody buying my quake kit saves his life, then what am I?
I'd feel good.''

   After 78 years, Gerber Products Co. this
week will ban the public from watching how babies' carrots are
crushed and their peas pureed, partly for fear of industrial
espionage.
   ``We realize there's nothing that can replace a plant tour _ the
sights, the sound, the noise,'' said Gerber spokesman Steve Poole.
   ``But plant tours have really become an anachronism. It's just a
reality of modern technology,'' he said. ``We know our competition
has been through the tour because we've spotted their sales reps.
We can't afford to take any chances.''
   Some 15,000 visitors a year have taken the free tour, which
covers about 10 percent of the 1-million-square-foot plant. At
first they walked, but in recent years battery-operated carts were
brought in.
   From a mezzanine window, a group of hairnetted visitors watched
recently as thousands of washed and peeled carrots careened down a
chute into a hopper, creating a dash of color on an otherwise gray
factory floor.
   ``Then the carrots are ground and mixed with other vegetables,''
said Mary Kay Ward, speaking through a portable microphone to be
heard above the whir of machinery shuttling thousands of jars along
conveyor belts.
   ``It's too bad that something that's been so popular over the
years should have to end,'' said Dorothy Rice, who led most of the
tours over the last 18 years before retiring last week.
   Gerber is only the latest food company to ban public tours. In
1986, the Kellogg Co. stopped giving tours of its cereal plant in
Battle Creek.
   ``In this age of liability insurance and increased productivity
and high technology, plant tours just don't fit in,'' said analyst
John McMillin of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Gerber's visitors center will close Friday and reopen on Labor
Day as a children's art gallery and 60-seat theater.
   Visitors will watch a five-minute 3-D movie about infant life,
from the infant's perspective. And a short video will show how baby
food is made.
   Gerber decided to produce the movie knowing that 15,000 visitors
a year means a lot in a community of 3,500.
   The town's strong identification with Gerber, which began as the
Fremont Canning Co. in 1901, is clear from the signs for Gerber
Life Insurance Co. and Gerber Memorial Hospital in the
one-stoplight downtown.
   The innocent eyes of the Gerber baby peer down from billboards
at drivers entering the town. A sign proclaims Fremont the ``Baby
Food Capital.'' Most of the company's 1,200 local employees live in
or around Fremont, where a half-billion jars of baby food are made
each year.
   Though first shaken by the news, Fremont business leaders
believe they'll survive, and perhaps prosper with a different
attraction.
   Fred Howes, president of the Chamber of Commerce, said he's
``not convinced that the general public is that enraptured by
manufacturing processes anymore.''
   Gerber hopes the film will appeal to whole families, including
children and senior citizens who didn't necessarily want to
experience manufacturing close-up _ not to mention the 120-degree
temperatures in parts of the plant.
   ``With 3.9 million babies born each year, 15,000 people a year
doesn't represent an impact on our (70 percent) brand share,''
Poole said. ``But it's important to the community. Even if people
just stop by and have an ice cream cone at the local establishment,
that's important to that establishment.''

<HEAD>Economist Warns of Uncontrolled Inflation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Soviet economist says the country is on the
brink of uncontrollable inflation thanks to shrinking production,
budget deficits and a rapid increase in the money supply.
   An article by Yegor Gaidar was displayed prominently in the
authoritative Communist Party daily Pravda on Sunday. It came as
the Soviet leadership debates a radical reform program to pull the
country from a financial crisis.
   ``The escalating financial crisis took us to the edge beyond
which suppressed inflation will break into the open regardless of
the will of the government or trade unions,'' Gaidar wrote.
   Falling production and more money in the hands of consumers is
rapidly increasing long-stable prices. The money supply is growing
at a rate six to eight times faster than it was a decade ago, and
production of many capital goods is falling, Gaidar said.
   On the open farmers' markets, the price of meat has increased 16
percent, the price of vegetables 13 percent and the price of fruit
20 percent, he said.
   Gaidar's article analyzed grim economic statistics for the first
quarter of 1990 that showed Soviet industrial production falling
1.2 percent. Oil production fell 4 percent and coal production fell
6 percent.
   While production of consumer goods rose by 4.7 percent, that of
capital goods plummeted 3.2 percent, Gaidar said.
   More Soviet workers were on strike. About 130,000 people were on
strike on any given day during the first quarter of 1990, he said.
   Government financial policy has aggravated the country's
financial woes, Gaidar said. ``To function normally in conditions
of reform the national economy needs stable finances and a firm
ruble,'' he wrote.
   The government was supposed to cut its expenditures and raise
its income in order to bring its budget deficit in line, Gaidar
said.
   Instead, ``the Supreme Soviet debates how to reduce taxes and
for what purposes to increase expenditures that no one seems to be
able to pay for,'' the article said.
   Faith in the Soviet economic structure is so low that government
grain purchases are falling, despite a good harvest last fall,
Gaidar said. He said farms are holding onto their grain to barter
it for needed goods and services rather than selling it to the
government.
   Gaidar said the Soviet Union has had some success fighting
shortages of sugar and laundry detergent, but in a disorganized
market solving one problem only leads to other shortages.
   Now fabrics, razors, pencils and cigarettes are in short supply,
he said.
   President Mikhail Gorbachev's Presidential Council is
considering a package of economic reforms that the Soviet leader
says give his country a market economy.
   After some reports that the country was considering following
Polish-style ``shock therapy'' of rapidly increasing prices and
cutting work forces, officials say they will not use such a model.
   Soviet economic officials say they are concerned about how much
more difficulty frustrated consumers are willing to accept.

   The police crackdown on striking
workers at the Hyundai shipyard signals a new government resolve to
keep labor in check in order to bolster the faltering South Korean
economy.
   Costs are rising, land speculation is rampant and inflation is
increasing at an annual rate above 10 percent for the first time in
many years. Exports aren't selling and the stock market is at a
two-year low.
   The government has been warning citizens for several months that
it feels the economy is under siege and that Koreans have a duty to
put the nation's interests first. In a word, that means work.
   But the government's efforts may backfire.
   Thousands of workers and radical students clashed with riot
police over the weekend, and a dissident labor organization has
called for a nationwide general strike on Tuesday, the May Day
labor holiday, to protest Saturday's police attack on the
strike-bound shipyard in Ulsan, 200 miles southeast of Seoul.
   Protesters denounced the attack as a government ploy to thwart
labor activism and dissent.
   When thousands of riot police surrounded the Hyundai Heavy
Industries Co. shipyard, the largest in the world, few doubted
their intent. Last year, 12,000 police stormed the complex to end
another strike.
   The government said the work stoppage by 20,000 laborers,
reportedly costing Hyundai $6 million a day, was illegal.
   At company request and in the national interest, the government
promised action unless strikers returned to work. At dawn Saturday,
the strike's fourth day, thousands of riot police backed up by
armored vans firing tear gas attacked the shipyard complex.
   Labor leaders said President Roh Tae-woo's government is more
repressive than past authoritarian regimes and has imprisoned
unfairly more than 200 labor leaders since taking office in 1988.
The figure could not be verified.
   Labor unrest, steep wage hikes and the rise of the South Korean
won against the dollar have hurt South Korean products' ability to
compete overseas. Korea's international image as a safe and
affordable place to do business also has suffered.
   ``The survival of the national economy was at stake,'' Park
Hee-tae, spokesman for the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, said in
defending the crackdown.
   Cheap labor and low-interest loans to big businesses like
Hyundai have been a key ingredient to building South Korea's
economy. Worker desires for better pay and living conditions have
spurred calls for more democracy.
   Low wages allowed South Korea to mass produce cars, electronics,
footwear, textiles and toys at competitive prices and sell them
overseas. By 1989, South Korea proclaimed itself the world's 10th
largest trading nation.
   But labor is no longer cheap and workers are demanding more
rights, including involvement in business and personnel decisions
affecting their managers and company presidents.
   Wages have increased 50 percent to 60 percent in South Korea in
the last two years, rivalling or surpassing those of other Asian
countries. Many goods that used to sell easily to other nations no
longer are competitive. Even comparable Japanese products can be
better priced.
   ``The plight of workers now has improved much in recent years,''
said Chong Un-bung, a political analyst.
   But some workers still live in substandard housing and receive
low pay. Many feel it's time they received a larger share of the
Korean economic pie.
   Companies are being asked to swallow cost increases in an
attempt to keep consumer prices down, which cuts earnings.
Consumers are being asked to forgo foreign imports and practice
thrift.
   South Korea's economy grew only 6.5 percent last year after
three successive years of growth exceeding 10 percent. Though the
rate is acceptable by international standards, government
economists say Korea needs at least 7.5 percent growth to control
unemployment.
   The country's current account registered a $1.1 billion deficit
in the first quarter of 1990, compared to a $1.3 billion surplus in
the same 1989 period. First-quarter exports declined 1.2 percent to
$13.9 billion.
   When the Korean stock market hit its lowest level since 1988
last week, angry investors stormed trading offices, smashing
computer terminals and furniture. Shrines were set up with hogs'
heads, rice cakes and fruit to pray for a turnaround.
